25|$|POTWs with <b>combined</b> <b>sewers</b> are {{required}} {{to comply with the}} national Combined Sewer Overflow Control Policy, published by EPA in 1994. The policy requires municipalities to make improvements to reduce or eliminate overflow-related pollution problems. About 860 communities in the US have combined sewer systems, serving about 40 million people.|$|E
25|$|Sewage {{may include}} {{stormwater}} runoff or urban runoff. Sewerage systems {{capable of handling}} storm water are known as combined sewer systems. This design was common when urban sewerage systems were first developed, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. <b>Combined</b> <b>sewers</b> require much larger and more expensive treatment facilities than sanitary sewers. Heavy volumes of storm runoff may overwhelm the sewage treatment system, causing a spill or overflow. Sanitary sewers are typically much smaller than <b>combined</b> <b>sewers,</b> {{and they are not}} designed to transport stormwater. Backups of raw sewage can occur if excessive infiltration/inflow (dilution by stormwater and/or groundwater) is allowed into a sanitary sewer system. Communities that have urbanized in the mid-20th century or later generally have built separate systems for sewage (sanitary sewers) and stormwater, because precipitation causes widely varying flows, reducing sewage treatment plant efficiency.|$|E
50|$|The United Kingdom Environment Agency {{identified}} unsatisfactory intermittent discharges {{and issued}} an Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive requiring action to limit pollution from <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> overflows. In 2009 the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment adopted a Canada-wide Strategy for the Management of Municipal Wastewater Effluent including national standards to (1) remove floating material from <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> overflows, (2) prevent <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> overflows during dry weather, and (3) prevent development or redevelopment from increasing frequency of <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> overflows.|$|R
50|$|MMSD's <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> {{overflows}} {{are smaller}} than those of other cities on the Great Lakes, including Cleveland's and Detroit's, and are {{similar to that of}} the smaller city of Grand Rapids. Year-to-year <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> overflows vary depending on local rainfall but as a recent example in 2014 MMSD <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> overflows totaled 342 million gallons, meaning that 99.5% of the total flow through the municipal sewer system was treated.|$|R
25|$|During high {{precipitation}} periods a <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> {{system may}} experience a <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> overflow event, which forces untreated sewage to flow directly to receiving waters. This can pose {{a serious threat}} to public health and the surrounding environment.|$|R
25|$|Portugal {{does not}} yet fully comply with EU {{regulations}} on wastewater discharges. Even where wastewater treatment plants exist they do not always function properly. Especially in cities with <b>combined</b> <b>sewers,</b> treatment plants do not function properly after heavy rains. Sewer overflows during heavy rains are frequent, partly due to unauthorized storm water drain connections to the sewer system.|$|E
25|$|In early 2006, {{the problem}} of {{wastewater}} management arose during a controversy over a planned arena for the Brooklyn Nets in nearby downtown Brooklyn. The project at that point, now called Pacific Park, was to include a basketball arena and 17 skyscrapers, with the resulting sewage would flow into antiquated <b>combined</b> <b>sewers</b> that can overflow when it rains. The Gowanus Canal has 14 combined sewer overflow points, so {{the fear is that}} the additional wastewater from the arena would lead to more frequent overflows in the canal.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} sanitation {{technology in}} urban areas is the collection of wastewater in gravity driven sewers, its treatment in wastewater treatment plants for reuse or disposal in rivers, lakes or the sea. Sewers are either combined with storm drains or separated from them as sanitary sewers. <b>Combined</b> <b>sewers</b> are usually found in the central, older parts or urban areas. Heavy rainfall and inadequate maintenance can lead to combined sewer overflows or sanitary sewer overflows, i.e., more or less diluted raw sewage being discharged into the environment. Industries often discharge wastewater into municipal sewers, which can complicate wastewater treatment unless industries pre-treat their discharges.|$|E
40|$|This {{fact sheet}} {{describes}} {{the use of}} pollution prevention best management practices (BMPs). These practices are intended to both reduce the volume of pollutants entering a <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> system (CSS), and to help {{reduce the number of}} <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> overflows (CSOs) that occur during storm water runoff producing events. ...|$|R
2500|$|Failing home {{septic systems}} can allow {{coliforms}} in the effluent to {{flow into the}} water table, aquifers, drainage ditches and nearby surface waters. [...] Sewage connections that are connected to storm drain pipes can also allow human sewage into surface waters. [...] Some older industrial cities, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest of the United States, use a <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> system to handle waste. [...] A <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> carries both domestic sewage and stormwater. During high rainfall periods, a <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> can become overloaded and overflow to a nearby stream or river, bypassing treatment.|$|R
50|$|Sewage {{treatment}} is less effective when sanitary waste is diluted with stormwater, and <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> overflows occur when runoff from heavy rainfall or snowmelt exceeds the hydraulic capacity of sewage treatment plants. To overcome these disadvantages, some cities built separate sanitary sewers to collect only municipal wastewater and exclude stormwater runoff collected in separate storm drains. The decision between a <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> system or two separate systems is mainly based on need for sewage treatment {{and cost of}} providing treatment during heavy rain events. Many cities with <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> systems built prior to installing sewage treatment have not replaced those sewer systems.|$|R
25|$|Japan has {{a policy}} of full cost {{recovery}} for drinking water and sanitary sewers through tariffs. Stormwater management is considered a public good and is thus financed through general tax revenue and not through water and sewer tariffs. The accounting systems in place clearly distinguish between {{the two types of}} expenses, even in systems with <b>combined</b> <b>sewers.</b> The working ratio (share of operating costs in total revenues) averages 49% for water utilities and 67% for sewer utilities, indicating a healthy surplus available for depreciation of assets, debt service and self-financed investments. The cost recovery ratio is 97% for drinking water and 53% for sewerage.|$|E
25|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defined {{secondary}} treatment {{based on the}} performance observed at late 20th-century bioreactors treating typical United States municipal sewage. Secondary treated sewage is expected to produce effluent with a monthly average of less than 30mg/l BOD and less than 30mg/l suspended solids. Weekly averages may be up to 50 percent higher. A sewage treatment plant providing both primary and {{secondary treatment}} is expected to remove at least 85 percent of the BOD and suspended solids from domestic sewage. The EPA regulations describe stabilization ponds as providing treatment equivalent to secondary treatment removing 65 percent of the BOD and suspended solids from incoming sewage and discharging approximately 50 percent higher effluent concentrations than modern bioreactors. The regulations also recognize the difficulty of meeting the specified removal percentages from <b>combined</b> <b>sewers,</b> dilute industrial wastewater, or Infiltration/Inflow.|$|E
25|$|Measures {{other than}} {{drainage}} {{have been implemented}} to contain flooding in the city. In 1950, dikes were built to confine storm runoff. Rivers that run through the city were encapsulated in 1950 and 1951. Rivers such as the Consulado River, Churubusco River and the Remedio River are encased in concrete tunnels which take their waters directly to the drainage system to leave the Valley. Two other rivers, the San Javier and the Tlalnepantla, which used to feed the old lake system, are diverted {{before they reach the}} city and their waters now flow directly into the Grand Canal. None of water from these rivers is allowed to sink into the ground to recharge the aquifer. While the rivers and streams that flow down from the mountain peaks still begin the way they always have, their passage through the shantytowns lacking city sanitation schemes that surround Mexico City turns them into open <b>combined</b> <b>sewers.</b> Therefore, their final stages are frequently culverted or added to the existing major culverted rivers to keep this water from contaminating the aquifer.|$|E

2500|$|High {{levels of}} {{pathogens}} {{may result from}} on-site sanitation systems (septic tanks, pit latrines) or inadequately treated sewage discharges. This {{can be caused by}} a sewage plant designed with less than secondary treatment (more typical in less-developed countries). In developed countries, older cities with aging infrastructure may have leaky sewage collection systems (pipes, pumps, valves), which can cause sanitary sewer overflows.

2500|$|Water {{pollution}} {{is a serious}} issue in Vietnam {{as a result of}} rapid industrialization and urbanization without adequate environmental management. As of 2008 only 10 percent of municipal wastewater was treated, and only 45% of industrial zones were expected to have wastewater treatment of some kind in 2010. The pollution of rivers and lakes in Hanoi is [...] "alarming" [...] according to municipal authorities, as up to 98 per cent of 200 rivers and lakes fail to meet the required water quality. Sewer systems consist of <b>combined</b> <b>sewers,</b> channeling both rainwater and municipal sewage. Small enterprises engaged in food processing and textile dyeing in so-called [...] "craft villages", of which there are 700 in the Red River Delta alone, discharge untreated wastewater. An analysis by the University of Technologies and the Ministry of Science and Technology showed that 100% of wastewater samples taken from craft villages exceed allowed levels of pollution. Vietnam also has more than 200 registered industrial zones without sustainable wastewater treatment. Industrial zones discharge 1 million cubic meters of untreated sewage per day, about 70 percent of all industrial wastewater. 8 industrial zones will be equipped with wastewater treatment plants {{with the help of a}} US$50 million loan from the World Bank approved in 2012. It is also planned to construct 30 wastewater treatment plants in the Mekong Delta until 2020, including 13 plants for domestic wastewater treatment and 17 for industrial wastewater treatment in Can Tho, a Giang, Kien Giang and Ca Mau provinces. In 2012 Hanoi expected to start the operation of the upgraded Yen So waste water treatment plant with a design capacity of 200,000 cubic meters per day; eight more wastewater treatment plants are planned in Hanoi alone.|$|E

40|$|Many <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> {{networks}} are currently constrained {{due to lack}} of capacity. Surface water entering the network may {{have an impact on the}} local environment by causing additional spills from <b>Combined</b> <b>Sewer</b> Overflows (CSOs) and flooding events. With the increasing number of developments taking place in Scotland, more and more demands are being placed upon the existing wastewater assets and infrastructure of the drainage utility, Scottish Water. The principal way of preventing these CSO spills/flooding event s is to reduce the number of surface water connections to the <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> network and promote more surface water discharges to nearby watercourses. The problem is being addressed by examining all development applications as they are considered by a drainage planning officer in the water authority.

5000|$|The {{maintenance}} requirements {{vary with the}} type of sanitary sewer. In general, all sewers deteriorate with age, but infiltration and inflow are problems unique to sanitary sewers, since both <b>combined</b> <b>sewers</b> and storm drains are sized to carry these contributions.

[...] The probability of inappropriate connections is higher where <b>combined</b> <b>sewers</b> and sanitary sewers are found in close proximity, because construction personnel may not recognize the difference.
