A mevel bras {{was the most}} important Breton farm worker, a man who might enjoy many privileges, but he was not of the landowning class and it was inconceivable in the old Brittany that he could aspire to marry into it. However, the mevel of the play, Jakez Mano, contrives by a complicated means to marry his master's daughter, God Konan. The fact that he <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only <b>think</b> <b>of</b> this but even achieve it is seen as proof that the old Brittany, in which marriages were decided by social status and by the ownership of land, is dying.|$|R
6000|$|... § 3. The {{instances}} of a priori fallacy {{which we have}} hitherto cited belong to the class of vulgar errors, and do not now, nor in any but a rude age ever could, impose upon minds of any considerable attainments. But those to which {{we are about to}} proceed, have been, and still are, all but universally prevalent among thinkers. The same disposition to give objectivity to a law of the mind—to suppose that what is true of our ideas of things must be true of the things themselves—exhibits itself in many of the most accredited modes of philosophical investigation, both on physical and on metaphysical subjects. In one of its most undisguised manifestations, it embodies itself in two maxims, which lay claim to axiomatic truth: Things which we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> together, can not co-exist; and Things which we can not help thinking of together, must co-exist. I am not sure that the maxims were ever expressed in these precise words, but the history both of philosophy and of popular opinions abounds with exemplifications of both forms of the doctrine.|$|E
6000|$|... § 4. Among the {{remaining}} forms of erroneous generalization, {{several of those}} most worthy of and most requiring notice have fallen under our examination in former places, where, in investigating the rules of correct induction, we have had occasion to advert to the distinction between it and some common mode of the incorrect. In this number is what I have formerly called the natural Induction of uninquiring minds, the induction of the ancients, which proceeds per enumerationem simplicem: “This, that, and the other A are B, I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> any A which is not B, therefore every A is B.” As a final condemnation of this rude and slovenly mode of generalization, I will quote Bacon’s emphatic denunciation of it; the most important part, as I have more than once ventured to assert, of the permanent service rendered by him to philosophy. “Inductio quæ procedit per enumerationem simplicem, res puerilis est, et precario concludit” (concludes only by your leave, or provisionally), “et periculo exponitur ab instantiâ contradictoriâ, et plerumque secundum pauciora quam par est, et ex his tantummodo quæ præsto sunt pronunciat. At Inductio quæ ad inventionem et demonstrationem Scientiarum et Artium erit utilis, Naturam separare debet, per rejectiones et exclusiones debitas; ac deinde post negativas tot quot sufficiunt, super affirmativas concludere.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Two {{hours from}} Tabor to Nazareth--and {{as it was}} an uncommonly narrow, crooked trail, we {{necessarily}} met all the camel trains and jackass caravans between Jericho and Jacksonville in that particular place and nowhere else. The donkeys do not matter so much, {{because they are so}} small that you can jump your horse over them if he is an animal of spirit, but a camel is not jumpable. A camel is as tall as any ordinary dwelling-house in Syria--which is to say a camel is from one to two, and sometimes nearly three feet taller than a good-sized man. In {{this part of the country}} his load is oftenest in the shape of colossal sacks--one on each side. He and his cargo take up as much room as a carriage. Think of meeting this style of obstruction in a narrow trail. The camel would not turn out for a king. He stalks serenely along, bringing his cushioned stilts forward with the long, regular swing of a pendulum, and whatever is in the way must get out of the way peaceably, or be wiped out forcibly by the bulky sacks. It was a tiresome ride to us, and perfectly exhausting to the horses. We were compelled to jump over upwards of eighteen hundred donkeys, and only one person in the party was unseated less than sixty times by the camels. This seems like a powerful statement, but the poet has said, [...] "Things are not what they seem." [...] I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> any thing, now, more certain to make one shudder, than to have a soft-footed camel sneak up behind him and touch him on the ear with its cold, flabby under-lip. A camel did this for one of the boys, who was drooping over his saddle in a brown study. He glanced up and saw the majestic apparition hovering above him, and made frantic efforts to get out of the way, but the camel reached out and bit him on the shoulder before he accomplished it. This was the only pleasant incident of the journey.|$|E

Wang Du and Tunei {{took the opportunity to}} chase them to Quyang (曲陽, in modern Baoding), but fell into a trap laid by Wang Yanqiu and were defeated with heavy casualties, forcing them to flee back to Ding. Wang Yanqiu also defeated another subsequent wave of Khitan reinforcements, and then put Ding under siege again. With Khitan forces discouraged by their defeat at Wang Yanqiu's hands, Ding's situation became difficult. As a desperate measure, Wang welcomed one Li Jitao (李繼陶)—a commoner boy that Emperor Zhuangzong had taken on one of his campaigns and adopted as his own son, but whom Emperor Mingzong had sent out of the palace when he took the throne—to Ding, and had him put on the emperor's yellow robe and sit on the city wall, stating to Wang Yanqiu, [...] "This is the son of Emperor Zhuangzong, who is now to be emperor.

60|$|To {{begin with}} the latter of them: Things which we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> except together, must exist together. This is assumed in the {{generally}} received and accredited mode of reasoning which concludes that A must accompany B in point of fact, because “it {{is involved in the}} idea.” Such thinkers do not reflect that the idea, being a result of abstraction, ought to conform to the facts, and can not make the facts conform to it. The argument is at most admissible as an appeal to authority; a surmise, that what is now part of the idea, must, before it became so, have been found by previous inquirers in the facts. Nevertheless, the philosopher who more than all others made professions of rejecting authority, Descartes, constructed his system on this very basis. His favorite device for arriving at truth, even in regard to outward things, was by looking into his own mind for it. “Credidi me,” says his celebrated maxim, “pro regulâ generali sumere posse, omne id quod valdè dilucidè et distinctè concipiebam, verum esse;” whatever can be very clearly conceived must certainly exist; that is, as he afterward explains it, if the idea includes existence. And on this ground he infers that geometrical figures really exist, because they can be distinctly conceived. Whenever existence is “involved in an idea,” a thing conformable to the idea must really exist; which is as much as to say, whatever the idea contains must have its equivalent in the thing; and what we are not able to leave out of the idea can not be absent from the reality.(232) This assumption pervades the philosophy not only of Descartes, but of all the thinkers who received their impulse mainly from him, in particular the two most remarkable among them, Spinoza and Leibnitz, from whom the modern German metaphysical philosophy is essentially an emanation. I am indeed disposed to think that the fallacy now under consideration has been the cause of two-thirds of the bad philosophy, and especially of the bad metaphysics, which the human mind has never ceased to produce. Our general ideas contain nothing but what has been put into them, either by our passive experience, or by our active habits of thought; and the metaphysicians in all ages, who have attempted to construct the laws of the universe by reasoning from our supposed necessities of thought, have always proceeded, and only could proceed, by laboriously finding in their own minds what they themselves had formerly put there, and evolving from their ideas of things what they had first involved in those ideas. In this way all deeply-rooted opinions and feelings are enabled to create apparent demonstrations of their truth and reasonableness, as it were, out of their own substance.|$|E

60|$|If I {{recollect}} that a {{piece of}} ice was cold yesterday, nothing can strengthen the recollection of that particular fact; on the contrary, it may grow weaker, {{in the absence of}} any record of it. But if I touch ice to-day and again find it cold, the association is repeated, and the memory of it becomes stronger. And, by this very simple process of repetition of experience, it has become utterly impossible for us to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> having handled ice without thinking of its coldness. But, that which is, under the one aspect, the strengthening of a memory, is, under the other, the intensification of an expectation. <b>Not</b> only <b>can</b> we <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> having touched ice, without feeling cold, but we cannot <b>think</b> <b>of</b> touching ice, in the future, without expecting to feel cold. An expectation so strong that it cannot be changed, or abolished, may thus be generated out of repeated experiences. And it is important to note that such expectations may be formed quite unconsciously. In my dressing room, a certain can is usually kept full of water, and I am in the habit of lifting it to pour out water for washing. Sometimes the servant has forgotten to fill it, and then I find that, when I take hold of the handle, the can goes up with a jerk. Long association has, in fact, led me to expect the can to have a considerable weight; and, quite unawares, my muscular effort is adjusted to the expectation.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{purposes}} of education policy is to ensure social justice in a society. The social justice needs {{to be thought of}} not only in conventional sense of ‘distributional’ justice, but also in the sense of ‘relational’ justice. Looking from this perspective the policies in Pakistan have historically focused only on distributional justice, albeit with dismal progress on this front. However, they have completely ignored the attainment of ‘relational’ justice as a policy objective. As a result power differentials not only exist but worsened through educational policies such as undermining of public schooling while encouraging privatization of education and creating and sustaining ‘educational apartheid’. Over concerns with ideology and language issues through education policy has undermined the focus on social justice even in current policy. Global educational targets have further aggravated this issue by engaging governments in attaining universal targets that hide the social justice concerns in a holistic way. In order to make any difference in the current situation, the focus of attention should not only be limited to critiquing the policy per se, rather an attempt needs to be made in challenging the relations of power at educational sites: schools, college and universities. Why <b>can</b> <b>not</b> we <b>think</b> <b>of</b> creating educational institutions (school, colleges, universities and teacher training facilities) which challenge the status quo and develop human resource of tomorrow that challenges the existing power structures of our society and help attain both distributional as well as relational social justice?
