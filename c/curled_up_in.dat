His {{thoughts}} are visible, ranging among rejection {{from his mother}} and humiliation from his peers to a scenario involving his own death. The game features 13 possible endings, one after each major boss fight.|$|E
5|$|A nocturnal animal, the Bengal slow loris has {{excellent}} night vision, {{enhanced by}} a tapetum lucidum—a layer of {{tissue in the}} eye that reflects visible light back through the retina. It sleeps during the day <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a ball in dense vegetation or in tree holes. Males and females mark their territory with urine. The species is known to live in small family groups. Animals may practice social grooming.|$|E
25|$|Chrysopelea ornata is {{a common}} snake and has adapted well to human habitats. In {{southern}} parts of Thailand, they are reported {{to hide in the}} thatch of the roofing material inside bungalows to prey on geckos and mice during the night. In these areas, one can almost be certain to be relatively close to a C. ornata most anywhere, perhaps hiding in the crown of the nearby coconut palm, under the roots of a tree, or even <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a potted plant. When hunting and pursuing fleeing prey, they have been reported to drop down out of the crown of coconut palms. Snakes are often indiscriminately killed, as many locals incorrectly assume all snakes are venomous. C. ornata is sometimes cooked for food.|$|E

25|$|From {{the second}} verse, Rihanna {{and her boyfriend}} are seen happily running amok in a supermarket, pushing {{each other in a}} {{shopping}} cart and spraying canned drinks at each other. This scene is interrupted with Rihanna in a Pontiac Trans Am outside with her boyfriend who begins to recklessly drive in circles, resulting in Rihanna asking him to stop the car which ensues into an argument between the pair. The video then progressively shows the couple experiencing mounting difficulties in their relationship. Rihanna removes herself from the car and returns moments later where we see her boyfriend grab her chin to look at him, suggesting that he is domestically violent towards her. During the final chorus Rihanna can be seen vomiting what appears to be pink and white streamers; she is also seen passed out on the street while her boyfriend tries to revive her. In another scene, Rihanna is seen lying on a couch while her boyfriend tattoos the word 'MINE' on her backside. Eventually, Rihanna decides to leave her boyfriend after finding him passed out on the floor of his apartment – and most likely due to the previous events shown throughout the video. The clip ends with Rihanna <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the corner of a room, crying.|$|E
500|$|When Sonic {{reaches the}} end of Act 1 or Act 2 of a zone while holding at least 50 rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a [...] "Special Stage." [...] In the Special Stages, Sonic is {{continually}} <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his Spin Attack animation, and bounces off the bumpers and walls of a fully rotating maze. In these levels, the player earns a continue with each 50 rings collected, but the main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald hidden within the maze. [...] Colliding {{with any of the}} blocks marked [...] "GOAL" [...] will instantly end the level.|$|E
500|$|Slow lorises (genus Nycticebus) are {{primates}} {{that belong}} to the suborder Strepsirrhini. They are found throughout South and Southeast Asia and the surrounding islands, {{and live in the}} upper canopy of tropical rainforests. They are nocturnal, sleeping during the day <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the fork of a tree. Slow lorises are slow and deliberate climbers and rarely come to the ground. They have a round face, woolly fur, a dark stripe down their back, and a tail that is reduced to a stump. Their head and body length ranges from [...] Their hands and feet are strong and good at grasping for long periods of time. Slow lorises are either solitary or live in pairs; the males are territorial and mark their territories with urine. Their diet consists of mollusks, small vertebrates, and fruit.|$|E

500|$|The chorus {{continues}} and {{the video}} cuts to {{a scene in}} which Rihanna and other people dance at an outside rave; Calvin Harris features as the DJ. As the second chorus begins, Rihanna and her boyfriend are happily running amok in a supermarket, pushing each other in a shopping cart and spraying canned drinks at each other. However, they begin arguing in a car. The video then shows the couple experiencing mounting difficulties in their relationship. They eventually begin to physically abuse one another. During the final chorus, Rihanna is seen vomiting streamers; she is also seen unconscious on the street while her boyfriend tries to revive her. After [...] finding the boyfriend unconscious on the floor of his apartment, Rihanna decides she has had enough of the relationship and leaves him. The video ends with Rihanna <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the corner of a room, crying.|$|E
2500|$|A female {{woodlouse}} {{will keep}} fertilised {{eggs in a}} marsupium {{on the underside of}} her body until they hatch into offspring that look like small white woodlice <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> balls. The mother then appears to [...] "give birth" [...] to her offspring. [...] Females are also capable of reproducing asexually.|$|E
2500|$|The Windows {{version was}} still only one working line of code but it {{required}} many, many more lines of overhead. Charles Petzold, who wrote several books about programming for the Windows API, said: [...] "The original hello world {{program in the}} Windows 1.0 SDK {{was a bit of}} a scandal. HELLO.C was about 150 lines long, and the HELLO.RC resource script had another 20 or so more lines. (...) Veteran programmers often <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> horror or laughter when encountering the Windows hello-world program." ...|$|E

2500|$|Olivia is {{revealed}} {{to be linked to}} the drug Cortexiphan, a chemical developed by William Bell, which supposedly allows children injected with it to retain higher brain functions which would normally deteriorate with age. Olivia was {{one of a group of}} preschool-age children who served as subjects of the experiment in her childhood home of Jacksonville, Florida. [...] As a result, Olivia is capable of unspecified psychic abilities, as demonstrated when she shuts off a series of lights wired into a bomb as a kill switch simply by thinking it. Walter has a video of Olivia as a child, ostensibly recorded during the drug trials, which shows her <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the corner of the room next to a badly charred bed with Walter saying: [...] "It's all right, you didn't mean it." [...] We later learn that Olivia started the fire with her mind. Olivia also had the ability to discern if an object originated in the alternate dimension due to a [...] "glimmer" [...] that only she could see. When trying to reawaken this ability in her as an adult, Dr. Bishop hypothesized that this ability was partially derived from Olivia's fear about seeing into the alternate dimension. [...] When Olivia regains part of her memories of her meeting with Bell, she is told that she is the only successful subject suitable to pass through dimensions without many known negative side-effects. She has been called the guardian of the gateway by Bell, who will prevent the invasion by the alternate dimension.|$|E

50|$|The long-eared {{hedgehog}} {{is smaller}} than the West European hedgehog; it weighs between 250-400 grams, and is much faster. It {{is less likely to}} <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a ball when approached by predators and will rather try and outrun or leap at predators with their relatively short needles.|$|R
50|$|The crazed Senator Duke kidnaps Kitty. He {{wants to}} show the world how vicious werewolves are, and keeps her caged up and under cameras during a full moon.

5000|$|A few {{species of}} Selaginella are desert plants known as [...] "resurrection plants", because they <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a tight, brown or reddish ball during dry times, and uncurl and turn {{green in the}} {{presence}} of moisture. Other species are tropical forest plants that appear at first glance to be ferns.|$|R

50|$|When threatened, {{armadillos}} run to {{the nearest}} burrow or crevice and tightly wedge themselves inside with their back alongside the wall. If no such burrow or shelter is available, armadillos <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> order to protect their vulnerable underside. Dasypus species are unable to roll into a complete ball like the Brazilian three-banded armadillo due their excessive number of dermal plates.|$|R

5000|$|Mammals {{regulate}} {{their core}} temperatures, using hypothalamic temperature sensors in their brains, but also elsewhere in their bodies. When core body temperature falls behavioral changes {{are set in}} motion, which, in humans, include the donning of warmer clothes, the seeking out of wind-free, warmer environments, and, eventually, the <b>curling</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the [...] "fetal position" [...] to reduce the surface area (skin) exposed to the cold.|$|R
