40|$|High {{pressure}} die casting (HPDC) is widely used for manufacturing aluminum parts in automotive industry. In high {{pressure die}} casting mold, chill vents are used to allow residual air and gases to exhaust out from the mold cavity. The objective {{of this paper is}} to design and develop a bi-metallic <b>chill</b> <b>vent</b> for high {{pressure die casting}} using copper alloy material having high thermal conductivity, coated with steel layer on the surface. Transient thermal analysis was carried out using ANSYS software, and temperature distribution was compared with bimetallic and tool steel chill vents. The results show a faster extraction of heat in bi-metallic <b>chill</b> <b>vent</b> than that with steel. This paper also presents the effect of varying internal diameter of cooling channel in <b>chill</b> <b>vent</b> cooling...|$|E
40|$|Inappropriate {{air vent}} design always induced {{porosities}} in thin and complex shape of high pressure die-casting (HPDC) products. Chill block installation was preferred to improve permanent molds for reducing porosities. There were not regular {{to obtain an}} appropriated <b>chill</b> <b>vent</b> from this method unless an experience of mold makers. This research was performed to investigate and evaluate the chill block performance in the HPDC mold of motorcycle fuel caps. The HPDC mold of the thin and complex shape product without chill vents was improved by inserting of chill blocks. The motorcycle fuel caps of molds with and without chill vents were compared to verify size and position of porosity defects. Furthermore the HPDC simulation using the finite element analysis (FEA) had been performed according to the physical experiment. The FEA results were compared and {{in agreement with the}} experimental data. Therefore an improvement of the HPDC mold should be used FEA to obtain the best way of the air vent design...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Globalisation {{of supply}} chains for the {{automotive}} industry has made it increasingly difficult for developed economies to compete on price alone. In Australia, Nissan Casting has adopted technologies to reduce tooling costs and improve productivity of the die casting machines which use vacuum. Nissan Casting was experiencing cracking of their dies which extended into cooling lines, causing porosity outbreaks and shortened die life. CAST developed a repair technology called CASTrepair ™ which is a relatively quick, simple and inexpensive repair technique for cracked cooling lines in HPDC dies. Also Nissan Casting is an extensive user of vacuum and a major issue was identified as unscheduled machine stoppages caused by aluminium blockages in the vacuum valves. The valves were of the mechanical shut off type and when they failed to shut off quickly enough aluminium entered the valve which then had to be changed. CAST developed CASTvac ™ which is essentially a three dimensional <b>chill</b> <b>vent</b> with no moving parts required {{as a means to}} stop the aluminium entering the vacuum system. CASTvac ™ has proven to be very reliable in production and has significantly reduced downtimes and toolroom maintenance at Nissan Casting. These two technologies, CASTrepair ™ and CASTvac™, will be explained in detail with the latest developments in the technologies and associated benefits of their adoption...|$|E
40|$|Air {{entrapment}} during diecasting {{die filling}} {{is a major}} problem that causes most rejects, after quality inspection, due to unattended and dangerous gas porosity, especially in high performance and structural parts. In the past years, many technologies were developed in order to reduce air entrapment during filling; among them, optimal results were mainly obtained by active (vacuum) and passive (<b>chill</b> <b>vents)</b> air evacuation systems. Nevertheless, only small knowledge on how to optimize dies design for those technologies is available for the die maker. In the same way, at now, many casting simulation software lacks in this specific field and today ventings, vacuum channels and <b>chill</b> <b>vents</b> are designed according to proprietary formulas and, mainly, experience. In order to understand what happens to air inside a die cavity before and during metal injection, an analytical model was developed to calculate and forecast air pressure and flow through vents. This model takes into account, in a very detailed way, all the phenomena that occurs during injection, with particular relevance to process parameters (injection speeds and strokes, temperatures, vacuum pressures…) as well as flow-related phenomena that can impact on air escape, like premature vents clogging. This mathematical model was then validated and optimized through extensive casting trials in different venting simulation (with vacuum, only <b>vents,</b> <b>chill</b> <b>vents,</b> no air escape…) on different casting shapes and with different process parameters. The model allows to the die designer to optimize vents and related operating process parameters, simulate and compare different air evacuation solutions and forecast the mean gas porosity fraction in the casting with a calculation time of only few seconds. Calculations were useful to demonstrate the influence of process parameters on air trapping and the main result was that venting (with or without vacuum) is ineffective without an optimal setup of casting parameters and a correct air escape area calculation...|$|R
40|$|Architectures for {{extended}} duration missions often include an on-orbit replenishment {{of the space}} vehicle's cryogenic liquid propellants. Such a replenishment could be accomplished via a tank-to-tank transfer from a dedicated tanker or a more permanent propellant depot storage tank. Minimizing the propellant loss associated with transfer line and receiver propellant tank thermal conditioning is essential for mass savings. A new methodology for conducting tank-to-tank transfer while minimizing such losses has been demonstrated. Charge-Hold-Vent is the traditional methodology for conducting a tank-to-tank propellant transfer. A small amount of cryogenic liquid is introduced to chill the transfer line and propellant tank. As the propellant absorbs heat and undergoes a phase change, the tank internal pressure increases. The tank is then vented to relieve pressure prior to another charge of cryogenic liquid being introduced. This cycle is repeated until the transfer lines and tank are sufficiently chilled and the replenishment of the propellant tank is complete. This method suffers inefficiencies due to multiple <b>chill</b> and <b>vent</b> cycles within the transfer lines and associated feed system components. Additionally, this system requires precise measuring of cryogenic fluid delivery for each transfer, multiple valve cycling events, and other complexities associated with cycled operations. To minimize propellant loss and greatly simplify on-orbit operations, an alternate methodology has been designed and demonstrated. The <b>Vented</b> <b>Chill</b> / No <b>Vent</b> Fill method is a simpler, constant flow approach in which the propellant tank and transfer lines are only chilled once. The receiver tank is continuously vented as cryogenic liquid chills the transfer lines, tank mass and ullage space. Once chilled sufficiently, the receiver tank valve is closed and the tank is completely filled. Interestingly, the vent valve can be closed prior to receiver tank components reaching liquid saturation temperature. An incomplete fill results if insufficient energy {{is removed from the}} tank's thermal mass and ullage space. The key to successfully conducting the no vent fill is to assure that sufficient energy is removed from the system prior to closing the receiver tank vent valve. This paper will provide a description of the transfer methodology and test article, and will provide a discussion of test results...|$|R

30|$|The shell cast {{outline of}} the {{split-type}} ranging arm is 2948  mm ×  1434  mm ×  961  mm, the minimum wall thickness is 45  mm, the maximum wall thickness is 119  mm, and the cast weight is 6380  kg. The position of water passage in the cast part needs to be tested in a hydrostatic test under eight standard atmospheric pressures, and the inner cavity is water leakage-proof. To make the castings with excellent mechanical properties, {{the density of the}} castings needs to be high and reaches GB 7233 — 87 II level in ultrasonic flaw detection. The geometry, allowance of machining, and dimensional deviation of the castings are consistent with the specifications of cast steel for engineering machinery JB/T 5939 — 1991. Therefore, based on ranging arm shell cast material composition based casting characteristics and structure, size, and casting weight level, the foundry program was determined, including the sand casting method and casting process (pouring position, parting surface, sand box structure and size). After the casting process was determined, the designs were conducted including the design of casting parameters, sand core design, gating system design, riser design, <b>chill</b> design, and <b>vent</b> design.|$|R
