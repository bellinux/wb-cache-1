40|$|The {{sustainable}} {{production and}} trade of plants, animals, and their products, including through artificial propagation and captive breeding, {{is an important}} strategy to supply the global wildlife market, particularly when the trade in wild specimens is restricted by CITES or other wildlife trade legislation. However, these production methods can become a potential mechanism for the laundering of material illegally collected from the wild, leading to recent calls {{for the development of}} traceability methods to determine the origin of traded products. Currently, identifying wild origin can be complex and may require expert knowledge and/or resource intensive molecular techniques. Here we show, using CITES Appendix I slipper orchids as a model system, that production times {{can be used as a}} threshold to identify plants in trade that have a high likelihood of being of wild origin. We suggest that this framework could be used by enforcement officers, online vendors, and others to flag material of potential concern for orchids and other high value plants in trade. Specifically, this knowledge <b>combined</b> with <b>nomenclature</b> and the list of CITES Trade Database species could be used to construct a species watch list and automate online searches. The results suggest that had this been applied, questions would have been raised regarding online sales of three recently described species...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Saxophonist Mark Turner {{represents}} {{one of the most influential}} and original modern improvisers on the saxophone. This thesis identifies and typifies a body of recurring intervallic relationships in his improvisations as examples of chromatic thirds relations. Establishing his lineage from both John Coltrane and ‘cool school” saxophonists Warne Marsh, it shows his adaptation of Coltrane’s major third cycles into more direct polytonal superimposition via the augmented scale and related structures through chromatic voice leading. The analysis is categorised by harmonic background, demonstrating Turner’s application of chromatic thirds cycles through the following contexts: solo improvisation, major, minor, dominant chords and harmony relating to the augmented scale. It uses a new system of <b>nomenclature</b> <b>combining</b> elements of set theory and traditional jazz chord symbols to denote relationships between the melodic improvisation and the underlying harmonic context. Subsequently, the thesis demonstrates Turner’s systematic and thorough use of chromatic third relations, particularly major third cycles, as melodic vocabulary through a variety of harmonic contexts. The system developed in this thesis enables a practical analysis of Turner’s harmonic concepts and melodic vocabulary, and the application of his harmonic concepts to improvisation...|$|R

This procedure {{is part of the}} “Global Sourcing Management-Tool”, developed by the author in co-operation with the German mechanical engineering company Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG and the Centre for European Economic Research Mannheim (ZEW). Based on foreign trade data, the method uses indicators, which allows a cross-section and longitudinal-section valuation of the average international competitiveness and the average supplied product quality of all possible supplier countries. The method thus provides a variety of information for procurement departments, including the present level and the dynamic of competitiveness and product quality for the potential supplier countries within every product group of the international product <b>nomenclature</b> (<b>Combined</b> System and the Harmonised System). Potential supplier countries - the companies of which have proven to be particularly competitive in the different product quality stages - are identified. This pre-selection of countries enables the companies to limit their search for potential suppliers to the selected supplier countries. High “search costs” are subsequently reduced and, in addition to that, trend prognoses can be constructed. Potential supplier countries which have not yet reached a certain quality standard or a certain competitiveness, but have caught up strongly during recent years, can be observed sensitively. international procurement process, international competitiveness, supplied product quality, product quality...|$|R
40|$|Heparin- and heparan sulfate-like glycosaminoglycans (HLGAGs) {{represent}} an important class of molecules that interact with and modulate {{the activity of}} growth factors, enzymes, and morphogens. Of the many biological functions for this class of molecules, {{one of its most}} important functions is its interaction with antithrombin III (AT-III). AT-III binding to a specific heparin pentasaccharide sequence, containing an unusual 3 -O sulfate on a N-sulfated, 6 -O sulfated glucosamine, increases 1, 000 -fold AT-III's ability to inhibit specific proteases in the coagulation cascade. In this manner, HLGAGs play an important biological and pharmacological role in the modulation of blood clotting. Recently, a sequencing methodology was developed to further structure-function relationships of this important class of molecules. This methodology <b>combines</b> a property-encoded <b>nomenclature</b> scheme to handle the large information content (properties) of HLGAGs, with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization MS and enzymatic and chemical degradation as experimental constraints to rapidly sequence picomole quantities of HLGAG oligosaccharides. Using the above property-encoded nomenclature-matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization approach, we found that the sequence of the decasaccharide used in this study is ΔU 2 SHNS, 6 SI 2 SHNS, 6 SI 2 SHNS, 6 SIHNAc, 6 SGHNS, 3 S, 6 S (±DDD 4 – 7). We confirmed our results by using integral glycan sequencing and one-dimensional proton NMR. Furthermore, we show that this approach is flexible and is able to derive sequence information on an oligosaccharide mixture. Thus, this methodology will make possible both the analysis of other unusual sequences in HLGAGs with important biological activity as well as provide the basis for the structural analysis of these pharamacologically important group of heparin/heparan sulfates...|$|R

40|$|A curated Web-based {{user-friendly}} sequence typing tool {{based on}} antimicrobial resistance determinants in Neisseria gonorrhoeae {{was developed and}} is publicly accessible ([URL] The N. gonorrhoeae Sequence Typing for Antimicrobial Resistance (NG-STAR) molecular typing scheme uses the DNA sequences of 7 genes (penA, mtrR, porB, ponA, gyrA, parC, and 23 S rRNA) associated with resistance to β-lactam antimicrobials, macrolides, or fluoroquinolones. NG-STAR uses the entire penA sequence, <b>combining</b> the historical <b>nomenclature</b> for penA types I to XXXVIII with novel nucleotide sequence designations; the full mtrR sequence and a portion of its promoter region; portions of ponA, porB, gyrA, and parC; and 23 S rRNA sequences. NG-STAR grouped 768 isolates into 139 sequence types (STs) (n = 660) consisting of 29 clonal complexes (CCs) having a maximum of a single-locus variation, and 76 NG-STAR STs (n = 109) were identified as unrelated singletons. NG-STAR had a high Simpson's diversity index value of 96. 5 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 959 to 0. 969). The most common STs were NG-STAR ST- 90 (n = 100; 13. 0 %), ST- 42 and ST- 91 (n = 45; 5. 9 %), ST- 64 (n = 44; 5. 72 %), and ST- 139 (n = 42; 5. 5 %). Decreased susceptibility to azithromycin was associated with NG-STAR ST- 58, ST- 61, ST- 64, ST- 79, ST- 91, and ST- 139 (n = 156; 92. 3 %); decreased susceptibility to cephalosporins was associated with NG-STAR ST- 90, ST- 91, and ST- 97 (n = 162; 94. 2 %); and ciprofloxacin resistance was associated with NG-STAR ST- 26, ST- 90, ST- 91, ST- 97, ST- 150, and ST- 158 (n = 196; 98. 0 %). All isolates of NG-STAR ST- 42, ST- 43, ST- 63, ST- 81, and ST- 160 (n = 106) were susceptible to all four antimicrobials.

Using the algorithms developed by Pierce and Schott (2012 a, 2012 b), the paper develops concordance procedures that allow researchers to trace changes in coding systems over time and to translate product-level production and trade data into a common classification that is consistent both within a single year and over time. Separate procedures are created for the eightdigit <b>Combined</b> <b>Nomenclature</b> system used to classify international trade activities at the product level within the European Union {{as well as for}} the eight-digit Prodcom categories used to classify products in European domestic production data. The paper further highlights important differences in coverage between the Prodcom and <b>Combined</b> <b>Nomenclature</b> classifications which need to be taken into account when generating combined domestic production and international trade data at the product level.
