40|$|A {{macroscopic}} model-based {{approach for}} {{estimation of the}} traffic state, specifically of the (total) density and flow of vehicles, is developed for the case of "mixed" traffic, i. e., traffic comprising both ordinary and <b>connected</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The development relies on the following realistic assumptions: (i) The density and flow of <b>connected</b> <b>vehicles</b> are known at the (local or central) traffic monitoring and control unit {{on the basis of}} their regularly reported positions, and (ii) the average speed of conventional vehicles is roughly equal to the average speed of <b>connected</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Thus, complete traffic state estimation (for arbitrarily selected segments in the network) may be achieved by merely estimating the percentage of <b>connected</b> <b>vehicles</b> with respect to the total number of vehicles. A model is derived, which describes the dynamics of the percentage of <b>connected</b> <b>vehicles,</b> utilizing only well-known conservation law equations that describe the dynamics of the density of <b>connected</b> <b>vehicles</b> and of the total density of all vehicles. Based on this model, which is a linear time-varying system, an estimation algorithm for the percentage of <b>connected</b> <b>vehicles</b> is developed employing a Kalman filter. The estimation methodology is validated through simulations using a second-order macroscopic traffic flow model as ground truth for the traffic state. The approach calls for a minimum of spot sensor-based total flow measurements {according to a variety of possible location configurations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} two {{case studies}} where a macroscopic model-based approach for traffic state estimation, {{which we have}} recently developed, is employed and tested. The estimation methodology is developed for a "mixed" traffic scenario, where traffic is composed of both ordinary and <b>connected</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Only average speed measurements, which may be obtained from <b>connected</b> <b>vehicles</b> reports, and a minimum number (sufficient to guarantee observability) of spot sensor-based total flow measurements are utilised. In the first case study, we use NGSIM microscopic data {{in order to test}} the capability of estimating the traffic state on the basis of aggregated information retrieved from moving vehicles and considering various penetration rates of <b>connected</b> <b>vehicles.</b> In the second case study, a longer highway stretch with internal congestion is utilised, in order to test the capability of the proposed estimation scheme to produce appropriate estimates for varying traffic conditions on long stretches. In both cases the performances are satisfactory, and the obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology, both in qualitative and quantitative terms.

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of <b>connected</b> <b>vehicles</b> in densely populated urban areas provides an interesting opportunity to counteract the high wireless data demands in high density and highly mobile scenarios. The idea is to support the macro base station (BS) with a secondary communication tier composed {{of a set of}} smart and <b>connected</b> <b>vehicles</b> that are in movement in the urban area. As a first step towards a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of this architecture, this paper considers the case where these vehicles are equipped with femto-mobile Access Points (fmAPs) and constitute a mobile out-of-band relay infrastructure. In particular, three techniques to select an fmAP (if more than one is available) are proposed and the maximal feasible gain in the packet delivery rate and data rate {{as a function of the}} vehicle density, average vehicle speeds, handoff overhead cost, as well as physical layer parameters is characterized. The analytical and simulation results provide a first benchmark characterizing this architecture and the definition of guidelines for its future realistic study and implementation.

40|$|<b>Connected</b> <b>Vehicles</b> are {{expected}} to provide a major improvement in road safety. By broadcasting Basic Safety Messages (BSM) using Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) all <b>connected</b> <b>vehicles</b> will have situational awareness of other <b>connected</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the area near them, and capability to provide ample warning of impending collisions. These systems rely on highly accurate GPS location data. GPS by design expects a clear line of sight (LoS) to four or more satellites for accuracy. City roads are often surrounded by buildings. These structures create areas isolated from sky views. Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) researchers have called these areas “urban canyons”. Buildings may block and/or bounce satellite signals, which can cause receivers to ‘see’ these signals either directly, indirectly, or both direct and indirect signals at the same time—which is the so-called multipath problem. Driving test results have been published which demonstrate the challenge. ITS researchers have noticed that position data taken by on-board units (OBU’s) contain these anomalies. When analyzed, these plots show vehicles {{as if they were}} driving through buildings. This is not helpful in preventing collisions. I will show that there is a data based approach to identify when Global Navigational Satellite System (GNSS) receivers are identifying impossible position results. I will also show a method using other available CAN bus data to interpolate expected geographic location and eliminate sending erroneous position reports...|$|R
