This leads to all kinds of errors and omissions, which are reflected in the negative phenomena observed in the gated housing estates (e. g. problems related to the lack of recreational areas and access roads and the location of service entities). Such an example is the gated community presented in the article where a number of adverse phenomena negatively affecting its operation have been recognised...|$|R

In the Buddhist canonical texts, the word [...] "jhāna" [...] is never explicitly used to denote them, they are instead referred to as āyatana. However, they are sometimes mentioned in sequence after the first four jhānas (other texts. e.g. MN 121 treat them as a distinct set of attainments) and thus came to be treated by later exegetes as jhānas.

40|$|About 21 {{percent of}} the total of 6. 5 {{millions}} dwellings in The Netherlands are row houses from the period after the Second World War (1946 - 1976). These post-war row houses don't match up with present-day demands. The main goal is to upgrade these dwellings resulting in a larger usable area combined with more comfort and convenience and giving a better energy performance. The first goal is to develop a unit that can be placed at the front or at the back of a row house while the occupant stays in his dwelling. This unit contains, if wanted, a kitchen or (for the second floor) a bathroom. The occupant can choose for one, two or three units on top of each other. Choosing three units means a new roof (with solar collector and photovoltaic solar cells) which connects the third unit and the old roof. The second goal is to upgrade the thermal resistance of the <b>complete</b> <b>dwelling</b> with limited inconvenience for the occupant. Further, attention will be paid to day lighting, acoustic insulation and other problems. With this design project outdated houses can be recycled into modern, comfortable, spacious low energy sustainable buildings...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is the residential market of the Czech Republic and changes of housing construction {{at a time}} of financial crisis. Residential market can be affected not only by financial crisis, but also by other factors that are not influenced by economic recession. The work is firstly aimed at the change of value added tax law in 2008 and its possible impact on the number of <b>completed</b> <b>dwellings.</b> Supply and demand could be influenced not only by these changes but by uncertainty about future form of these changes, too. The second part of this work is aimed at possible impact of demographic structure on started housing construction. There are two time series that are correlated [...] the number of inhabitants of the Czech Republic between the ages of 25 to 39 and the number of started dwellings. The results show that newly started housing construction is not depended on the number of inhabitants at determined age group in conditions of the Czech Republic.

40|$|Spatial {{differentiation}} of migration {{processes in the}} Czech Republic Abstract The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze internal migration in the Czech Republic and assess the extent to which selected indicators contribute to internal migration of the population in the municipalities in the Czech Republic. The first part is focused on the theoretical background for this study and on the discussion of literature. On the basis of literature the indicators were selected for subsequent analysis. The selected indicators are: the number of <b>completed</b> <b>dwellings,</b> the number of jobs, unemployment rate and population density. The next part outlines the development of internal migration in the Czech Republic between 1991 - 2012. After the subsequent evaluation of the development of selected indicators and internal migration at the municipal level, the relationship of migration and selected indicators for determined years is analyzed through linear regression, exploratory spatial data analysis and geographically weighted regression. The result is an assessment of the impact of selected indicators on internal migration in the Czech Republic and evaluation of the contribution of the methods used for exploration of relationships between migration and selected indicators.

40|$|Building more {{air-tight}} dwellings {{is having}} a deleterious impact on indoor air quality. In a range of recently <b>completed</b> <b>dwellings</b> CO 2 concentrations were measured in occupied bedrooms at unacceptable concentrations (occupied mean peak of 2317 ppm and a time weighted average of 1834 ppm, range 480 - 4800 ppm). Such high levels confirm that air-tight dwellings with only trickle ventilators as the 'planned' ventilation strategy {{do not meet the}} standards demanded by the Building Regulations. Reducing ventilation rates to improve energy efficiency and lower carbon emissions, without providing a planned and effective ventilation strategy is likely to result in a more toxic and hazardous indoor environment, with concurrent and significant negative long-term and insidious impacts on public health. Furthermore, the methodology underpinning the current regulations cannot be considered as creditable. While the complexity around numerical modeling often leads to conclusions based upon simplistic and unrealistic assumptions around all doors in a dwelling being open and trickle ventilators being unobstructed, this paper demonstrates that in 'real life' situations, {{this is not the case}} and could lead to significant risks of under ventilation. This is particularly the case when standards and guidance are based upon theoretically modeled scenarios that are not representative of real-life operation. The consequences of this are important in terms of the likely negative impacts on occupant health...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a comparative {{analysis of the}} construction sector in the Czech Republic and Poland, with a particular focus on the housing segment in selected regions. The authors compared the size and growth ofthe housing segment. To achieve the purpose, spatial and dynamic analyses of the construction sector indicators were conducted, with a particular emphasis on the housing segment (i. e. growth of construction sectorproduction, <b>completed</b> <b>dwellings</b> per 1000 inhabitants). In global economic crisis, the construction production fluctuation displayed a  similar  trend  for  both  countries,  with  the  worst  indicators  reported  in  2010   and 2011.   The  main  analysis  focused  on  the  dwelling  segment.   The  Czech  Republic reported  a  negative  growth  (- 2. 4 %)   in  the  number  of  completed  dwellings  in  the period, while Poland reported a positive growth of 32. 6 %. Analysed  countries  differ  regarding  the construction  industry  output,  which  depends  on  the  different  population  potential and uneven distribution of construction projects, particularly in the housing segment. Nonetheless, a common tendency was observed in the housing segment showing an intensified growth in the output in the areas that hadseen fewer investment projects.

In a population-based cohort study, the authors identified risk factors for mortality from the September 21, 1999, Taiwan earthquake, which occurred {{in the middle of}} the night. Among 297, 047 earthquake victims in central Taiwan who experienced partial or <b>complete</b> <b>dwelling</b> damage, 295, 437 (noncases) survived the earthquake and 1, 610 (cases) died between September 21 and October 31, 1999. Odds ratios were adjusted for both micro-level individual variables and macro-level neighborhood variables. People with mental disorders (odds ratio (OR) = 2. 0, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 1, 3. 5), people with moderate physical disabilities (OR = 1. 7, 95 % CI: 1. 2, 2. 3), and people who had been hospitalized just prior to the earthquake (OR = 1. 4, 95 % CI: 1. 2, 1. 7) were the most vulnerable. The degree of vulnerability increased with decreasing monthly wage (measured in New Taiwanese dollars (NT$)) (NT$ 20, 000 ∼NT$ 39, 999 : OR = 1. 5, 95 % CI: 1. 1, 2. 1; <NT$ 20, 000 : OR = 2. 2, 95 % CI: 1. 6, 3. 0). The significant associations of both prequake health status and socioeconomic status with earthquake death suggest that earthquake death did not occur randomly.

40|$|Housing {{provisions}} {{by public}} agencies for low-income people present a dismal picture in most developing countries. The reasons are typically scarce resources and adoption of high standards, which {{result in a}} limited supply of <b>complete</b> <b>dwelling</b> units, inappropriate {{in their use of}} resources and, at the same time, not responsive to the occupants' needs and priorities. This study puts forward that, in the context of India, public interventions (which include governmental and other agencies) have not only had limited success in providing housing, but have tended to neglect the impacts the housing programs and projects have on a local area. The study examines the policies and programs at both the overall and local level, using case-studies to illustrate different types of public interventions generally in India, and specifically within East Calcutta. The study is outlined in four parts. The first part deals with describing the overall situation of housing policies in India and development policies of East Calcutta. The second part looks at the local context in detail, documenting its characteristics, and describing through three case-studies the impact of these interventions on the settlements. It illustrates the major impacts that public interventions have had on settlement formation, user- involvement in dwelling provision and security of tenure. The third part elaborates the reasons for wanting to know about the impacts and a process for documenting them. The emphasis is on understanding hard-to- measure qualitative impacts rather than quantifiable ones. The last part summarizes the range of issues and impacts and presents the findings about the hypotheses that were put forward initially. The study concludes that public interventions can {{play an important role in}} housing processes if they are designed to make use of the local context as an active input in areas of policy planning and project implementation. by Rita Sampat.

In this way Petre was referring in a modest way to the original Gothic revival period as conceived by such architects as James Wyatt, rather than the later Gothic, after it had fallen under the ecclesiastical Anglo-Catholic influences of such architects as Augustus Pugin in England, and Benjamin Mountfort in New Zealand.|$|R
