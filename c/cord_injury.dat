5|$|Persons with spinal <b>cord</b> <b>injury</b> are at {{increased}} risk for urinary tract infection in part because of chronic use of catheter, and in part because of voiding dysfunction.

Additionally, use of cranberry juice or cranberry supplement appears to be ineffective in prevention and treatment in this population.|$|E
5|$|Accompanying {{injuries}} often play a {{key role}} in the outcome. Injuries that may accompany TBI include pulmonary contusion and laceration; and fractures of the sternum, ribs and clavicles. Spinal <b>cord</b> <b>injury,</b> facial trauma, traumatic aortic rupture, injuries to the abdomen, lung, and head are present in 40–100%. The most common accompanying injury is esophageal perforation or rupture (known as Boerhaave syndrome), which occurs in as many as 43% of the penetrating injuries to the neck that cause tracheal injury.|$|E
5|$|The {{medical costs}} for catastrophic {{injuries}} {{can be extremely}} high—a 2011 estimate from the National Spinal <b>Cord</b> <b>Injury</b> Statistical Center notes that first-year costs {{of someone who has}} high tetraplegia, an injury that causes partial or full loss of use in all limbs, is USD $1,044,097, with subsequent years costing $181,328. Many high schools across the United States require students to have an insurance policy, while others offer supplementary insurance to help offset the cost; some schools also request that boosters help families pay for these policies.|$|E

40|$|Background: Spinal <b>cord</b> <b>injuries</b> {{are highly}} {{disabling}} and deadly injuries. Currently, few studies focus on non-traumatic spinal <b>cord</b> <b>injuries,</b> {{and there is}} little information regarding the risk factors for complete injuries. This study aims to describe the demographics and the injury characteristics for both traumatic and non-traumatic spinal <b>cord</b> <b>injuries</b> and to explore the risk factors for complete spinal <b>cord</b> <b>injuries.</b> Methods: A retrospective study was performed by reviewing the medical records of 3, 832 patients with spinal <b>cord</b> <b>injuries</b> who were first admitted to the sampled hospitals in Guangdong, China. The demographics and injury characteristics of the patients were described and compared between the different groups using the chi-square test. Logistic regression was conducted to analyze the risk factors for complete spinal <b>cord</b> <b>injuries.</b> Results: The proportion of patients increased from 7. 0 % to 14. 0 % from 2003 to 2011. The male-to-female ratio was 3. 0 : 1. The major cause of spinal <b>cord</b> <b>injuries</b> was traffic accidents (21. 7 %). Many of the injured were workers (36. 2 %), peasants (22. 8 %), and unemployed people (13. 9 %); these occupations accounted for 72. 9 % of the total sample. A multivariate logistic regression model revealed that the OR (95 % CI) for male gender compared to female gender was 1. 25 (1. 07 – 1. 89), the OR (95 %CI) for having a spinal fracture was 1. 56 (1. 35 – 2. 60), the OR (95 %CI) for having a thoracic injury was 1. 23 (1. 10 – 2. 00), and the OR (95 %CI) for having complications was 2. 47 (1. 96 – 3. 13) ...|$|R

The Lonely Hearts Club Tour was initially scheduled to begin on 4 May at the Manchester Cathedral in Manchester, although it was delayed after Diamandis sustained a vocal <b>cord</b> <b>injury,</b> and ultimately began on 18 June at The Waterfront in Norwich. The American leg of the tour began on 10 July at The Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles, while the tour itself ended on 29 May 2013 after a performance at the Rumsey Playfield in New York City.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} {{at or above}} the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the legs and hips, genitourinary system, and anus. People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles. Bowel and bladder function are regulated by the sacral region. It is common to experience sexual dysfunction after injury, as well as dysfunction of the bowel and bladder, including fecal and urinary incontinence. It is also possible for the bladder to fail to empty, leading to a potentially harmful buildup of urine. One sign of spinal <b>cord</b> <b>injury</b> that emergency providers may find is priapism, an erection of the penis.|$|E
5|$|Although spinal <b>cord</b> <b>injury</b> (SCI) often causes sexual dysfunction, {{many people}} with SCI are able to have {{satisfying}} sex lives. Physical limitations acquired from SCI affect sexual function and sexuality in broader areas, {{which in turn has}} important effects on quality of life. Damage to the spinal cord impairs its ability to transmit messages between the brain and parts of the body below the level of the lesion. This results in lost or reduced sensation and muscle motion, and affects orgasm, erection, ejaculation, and vaginal lubrication. More indirect causes of sexual dysfunction include pain, weakness, and side effects of medications. Psycho-social causes include depression and altered self-image. Many people with SCI have satisfying sex lives, and many experience sexual arousal and orgasm. People with SCI employ a variety of adaptations to help carry on their sex lives healthily, by focusing on different areas of the body and types of sexual acts. Neural plasticity may account for increases in sensitivity in parts of the body that have not lost sensation, so people often find newly sensitive erotic areas of the skin in erogenous zones or near borders between areas of preserved and lost sensation.|$|E

To help individuals with spinal <b>cord</b> <b>injuries</b> return to work or retain employment, rehabilitation professionals must understand the barriers to employment and intervene to reduce or remove them. Hence, a focus group study was administered to 16 people with spinal <b>cord</b> <b>injuries</b> to explore return to work barriers.
