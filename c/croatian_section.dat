Although {{the first section of}} the route, now designated as the A4 motorway, was completed in 1980, development for the motorway was proposed once again in 1991 to facilitate links between the Varaždin area, Zagreb and the remainder of the Croatian motorway network. The route was added to the network of Pan-European transport corridors in June 1997, during the third Pan-European Transport Conference in Helsinki, and on August 7, 1997, the government of the Republic of Croatia decided to establish the Autocesta RijekaZagrebGoričan company and award it a 28-year concession to develop, operate and maintain the route as a six-lane motorway. The route consisted of the entire <b>Croatian</b> <b>section</b> of the Pan-European corridor Vb except for [...] of the LučkoIvanja Reka section of the A3 motorway, which was already in use as a part of Zagreb bypass.|$|E

40|$|Geochemical (δ 13 C, δ 18 O and Mn) {{compositions}} of Lower Jurassic shallow-water carbonates cropping out in Croatia {{were analyzed}} to elucidate {{the impact of}} the early Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (T-OAE) on the Adriatic Carbonate Platform (AdCP). The bulk-rock carbon-isotope records through the studied sections (Velebit-A, Velebit-B and Gornje Jelenje) are characterized by two significant excursions: (i) an initial positive trend interrupted by a pronounced negative shift (c. 2. 5 ‰) that is followed by (ii) an increasing trend of positive values (up to 4. 5 ‰). A comparison with δ 13 C trends obtained from well-calibrated sections from other localities in Europe shows that the overall character of the early Toarcian negative excursion is clearly reproduced in the curves derived from Croatian shallow-water deposits, which helps to date the sequences and reinforces the global character of the carbon-cycle perturbation. Lower Jurassic sedimentary successions in the studied area show a gradual deepening trend corresponding to deposition of the Toarcian spotted limestones. Assuming that the distinctive negative excursion in the carbon-isotope curves is synchronous across the AdCP, the contact between the spotted limestones and the underlying beds rich in lithiotid bivalves appears to be diachronous within the study area. The Mn record through the <b>Croatian</b> Velebit-A <b>section</b> and, in particular, the rise in concentration (up to 100 ppm) coinciding with the beginning of the δ 13 Ccarb positive shift, reflects a change in the redox conditions in seawater that allowed diagenetic incorporation of reduced manganese into the calcite structure of the carbonate sediment during the onset of the T-OAE. © 2013 Cambridge University Press...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review the range of social {{policies}} that have been adopted by the government of Croatia since independence together with those that have been retained from the socialist past and to ask whether it might be possible to improve them. The paper concentrates on issues of social security and employment. After the Introduction, in Section 2 we provide estimates of the level and composition of social expenditure in Croatia in the last two or three years. These show that the scale of public expenditure has been growing and that it is high compared with a number of other transition economies. This is also true of social expenditure within the overall budget. It is this development that has, in fact, prompted the present report. Section 3 focuses upon the labour market. It assesses evidence on participation and on the level of unemployment. It also examines evidence on inequality and poverty. Finally, it looks at the unemployment benefit to see how far it provides an adequate safety-net for those who lose their jobs. Section 4 concentrates on the structure of social welfare and social assistance programmes provided by the <b>Croatian</b> government. Finally, <b>Section</b> 5 examines possible ways in which the efficacy of the present system might be improved. social welfare, Europe, public policy...|$|R

In that area the E71 reaches Zagreb and connects to the city {{through a number of}} interchanges along the Zagreb bypass. Along the three motorways, the E71 is concurrent with the E65, and in the A3 motorway section of the E71, the route is also concurrent with the European route E70. The E71 route diverges from the A1 motorway at Karlovac interchange and switches to the D1 state road passing through Karlovac towards Plitvice Lakes, switches to the D217 and reaches Ličko Petrovo Selo/Izačić border crossing to Bosnia and Herzegovina. It further specifies that the E71 runs through Bihać, Bosnia and Herzegovina and back to Croatian border, passing via Užljebić border crossing and D218 state road to Otrić, where the E71 rejoins the D1 state road running to Split via Podi interchange with the A1 motorway. All the <b>Croatian</b> state road <b>sections</b> of the E71 and the E71 sections in Bosnia and Herzegovina consist of two-lane roads with at-grade intersections except for the northernmost section of the D1/E71 concurrency running through Karlovac, and the final 12 km of the D1/E71 concurrency between the Podi interchange (A1 motorway) and Split, both of which are executed as expressways.

40|$|Teorija prava Marijana Pavčnika može biti poticaj za uočavanje i ispravljanje jednostranosti hrvatske teorije prava jer je monistična po tome što je sinteza ranijih teorija, pretpostavlja normativnu metodu kao temeljnu metodu spoznaje prava i drži da sve pravo pripada jednome jedinome pravnom poretku. Marijan Pavčnik’s Legal Theory is an {{outstanding}} work on the foundations of law written by an internationally renowned author. It is of special relevance to Croatian readers as an incentive to recognize and rectify the one-sidedness of Croatian legal theory. The function of history as theory in <b>Croatian</b> legal thought (<b>section</b> 1. 1) explains why the Croatian mainstream legal theory has adopted an integral conception of law but leaned towards sociologization and even fully fledged naturalization of legal science (section 1. 2) with consequences for both legal education (section 1. 3) and legal practice (section 1. 4). Analytical legal theory, which is preoccupied with the objective meaning of law-creating acts {{is typical of the}} Slovenian tradition (section 2. 1), within which Pavčnik has written his Legal Theory (section 2. 2). The following tenets of Pavčnik’s Legal Theory, which are typically analytical and – {{in one way or another}} – monistic, are instructive for Croatian legal theory: a sound legal theory is monistic in that it is a historical synthesis rather than an original creation that ignores or bypasses earlier theories (section 2. 2. 1); law is a meaning of social action that can be recognized by the normative method, which is monistic in so far as other methods can change and amend but not replace it (section 2. 2. 2); law is monistic in that there can be only one single legal order (section 2. 2. 4). Despite the differences, Croatian and Slovenian legal theory may have more in common by both being rooted, Croatian via general legal history and Slovenian via Kelsen’s pure theory, in Hegel’s philosophy...|$|R

The data from Croatia {{relates to the}} entire <b>Croatian</b> <b>section</b> of the Danube River and to {{the section of the}} Sava River along the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina. The data from Hungary covers 60 km of the Danube River north of the Croatian border. Absolute catches in kilograms, as well as CPUE (kg per fisherman per year) by both groups in all three river sections varied from year to year without dramatic changes. Fishing with nets, artisanal fishermen differ from the anglers in two major ways: they are less selective and they catch bigger specimens. According to the official data, the existing ratio between recreational and artisanal fishermen in these three river sections does not negatively affect each other’s or overall fishing. Therefore, a conclusion can be drawn that medium-intensive artisanal fisheries qualify to co-exist with recreational fisheries...|$|E
40|$|The Croatian-Hungarian border {{section of}} the Dráva River has been {{undisturbed}} for almost a century, and {{it is characterised by}} unique fluvial morphology (braided pattern and islands) supporting rich habitats and wildlife.

On a local scale cut-offs, revetments and groynes were built. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of these human interventions. As the result of the alteration of the hydrology the channel pattern of the Dráva has been changing from braided to meandering, though on the upstream meandering part the territory and number of islands increased due to the drop of water stages.

There are very few published papers on the biology of these fish species, and even less on their natural feeding in the open waters. Although these fish species economically less important, is play an important role in the open waters ecological niche. One of the most important factors for the ecological niche is food web.
