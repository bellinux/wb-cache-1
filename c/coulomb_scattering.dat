[...] The ion oscillation is predicted to maintain the equilibrium distribution of the ions at all times, which would eliminate any power loss due to <b>Coulomb</b> <b>scattering,</b> resulting in a net energy gain. Working off this design, researchers in Russia simulated the POPS design using Particle-in-cell code in 2009. This reactor concept becomes increasingly efficient as the size of the device shrinks. However, very high transparencies (>99.999%) are required for successful operation of the POPS concept. To this end S.

40|$|Proton, as well {{as other}} ion, beams applied by {{electro-magnetic}} deflection in pencil-beam scanning (PBS) are minimally perturbed and thus can be quantified a priori by their fundamental interactions in a medium. This a priori quantification permits an optimal reduction of characterizing measurements on a particular PBS delivery system. The combination of a priori quantification and measurements will then suffice to fully describe the physical interactions necessary for treatment planning purposes. We consider, for proton beams, these interactions and derive a 'Golden' beam data set. The Golden beam data set quantifies the pristine Bragg peak depth-dose distribution in terms of primary, multiple <b>Coulomb</b> <b>scatter,</b> and secondary, nuclear scatter, components. The set reduces the required measurements on a PBS delivery system to the measurement of energy spread and initial phase space as a function of energy. The depth doses are described in absolute units of Gy(RBE) mm 2 Gp- 1, where Gp equals 109 (giga) protons, thus providing a direct mapping from treatment planning parameters to integrated beam current.

40|$|Graphitic nitrogen-doped {{graphene}} is {{an excellent}} platform to study scattering processes of massless Dirac fermions by charged impurities, in which high mobility can be preserved due {{to the absence of}} lattice defects through direct substitution of carbon atoms in the graphene lattice by nitrogen atoms. In this work, we report on electrical and magnetotransport measurements of high-quality graphitic nitrogen-doped graphene. We show that the substitutional nitrogen dopants in graphene introduce atomically sharp scatters for electrons but long-range <b>Coulomb</b> <b>scatters</b> for holes and, thus, graphitic nitrogen-doped graphene exhibits clear electron-hole asymmetry in transport properties. Dominant scattering processes of charge carriers in graphitic nitrogen-doped graphene are analyzed. It is shown that the electron-hole asymmetry originates from a distinct difference in intervalley scattering of electrons and holes. We have also carried out the magnetotransport measurements of graphitic nitrogen-doped graphene at different temperatures and the temperature dependences of intervalley scattering, intravalley scattering and phase coherent scattering rates are extracted and discussed. Our results provide an evidence for the electron-hole asymmetry in the intervalley scattering induced by substitutional nitrogen dopants in graphene and shine a light on versatile and potential applications of graphitic nitrogen-doped graphene in electronic and valleytronic devices.

40|$|The {{extended}} use of beam loss monitoring {{has led to}} {{a better}} understanding of the linear and non-linear physics involved in the single and multiple particle dynamics at BESSY. This knowledge has been used for improving the performance of the light source in terms of lifetime, beam stability, and stability of the energy. The key to these experiments are loss monitors placed at strategic locations of the ring with high sensitivity to Touschek or <b>Coulomb</b> <b>scattered</b> particles. Coulomb-scattering depends strongly on the transverse dynamics which is determined by the magnetic guiding fields. Losses occur primarily at the vertical aperture restrictions imposed by the flat insertion device vacuum chambers. Tune scan measurements clearly show resonances produced by the lattice magnets and by some of the insertion devices. Touschek scattering depends on the 3 -dimensional electron density and the spins of the colliding particles. In transfer function type experiments these dependencies have been used to observe the effect of resonant transverse and longitudinal beam excitations. Loss monitors allow to detect excited head-tail and higher longitudinal modes which are invisible in the center of mass motion. Another application is the detection of the resonant destruction of the spin polarization of the ensemble of electrons. This is used routinely in order to determine the beam energy with high accuracy. ...|$|R

40|$|Lattice {{disorder}} due to atomic vacancies has detrimental {{impact on}} the transport properties of monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs; MX 2). We theoretically study the effect of Mo and S vacancies on carrier scattering and transport in p- and n-type monolayer MoS 2 based on an atomistic first-principles description of atomic disorder. Due {{to the presence of}} vacancy midgap states, the vacancies are shown to act as combined short-range and <b>Coulomb</b> disorder <b>scattering</b> centers. For the short-range scattering potential typical for atomic point defects, we surprisingly find that the threefold rotational symmetry of the vacancy sites, in most cases, leads to a strong protection against intervally scattering. In addition, we find that Mo and S vacancies resemble, respectively, strong and weak short-range disorder. The dual character of the vacancies results in a nontrivial interplay between short-range and <b>Coulomb</b> disorder <b>scattering</b> and a pronounced screening-induced temperature and density dependence of the low-temperature carrier mobility. Our work identifies atomic vacancies as the likely source of both short-range and Coulomb disorder in monolayer TMDs, and presents a unified microscopic framework where these scattering mechanisms can be treated consistently.

The physics of energy straggling and Multiple Scattering was developed quite far by Williams from 1929 to 1945. Williams devised a theory, which consists of fitting the Multiple Scattering distribution as a Gaussian-like portion due to small scattering angles and the single collision tail due to the large angles. William, E.J., studied beta particle straggling, Multiple scattering of fast electrons and alpha particles, and cloud curvature tracks due to scattering to explain Multiple scattering in different scenario and he proposed a mean projection deflection occurrence due to scattering. His theory later extended to multiple scattering of alpha particles.Goudsmit and Saunderson provided a more complete treatment of Multiple Scattering, including large angles. [...] For large angles Goudsmit considered series of Legendre polynomials which are numerically evaluated for distribution of scattering. The angular distribution from <b>Coulomb</b> <b>scattering</b> has been studied in detail by Molière.,(Molière:1948) and further continued by Marion and coworkers.
