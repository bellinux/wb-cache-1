40|$|The {{disposal}} of sewage wastes comprises {{as one of}} the major worldwide environmental problems as these wastes render the environment unfriendly. The growing demand for waste utilization has made solid wastes like sludge and demolition waste an essential composition of this study. The possibility of reduction of the production costs provides a strong logic for use of this waste. Generally sludge, a bio degradable materials are dumped in the land, and they decompose over the period of time. But such {{disposal of}} waste product becomes limited in big cities because of land limitations. The alternative solution for such is incineration. But the substantial ash produced after its burning needs to be disposed by some or other means. This study involves the usage of sludge and demolition waste as an essential ingredient. The sludge was checked for its physical characterization such as bulk density, compressive strength and chemical properties such as water absorption percentage, presence of toxic metals for the commercial purpose. The study was performed by using different ratios of sludge such as 3 : 2 : 2 : 3, 3 : 2 : 3 : 2, 2 : 3 : 2 : 3 of fly ash, <b>cement,</b> <b>sludge</b> and demolition waste respectively for making brick samples. The test results showed a common trait that with the increase in content of sludge, the strength decreased. A maximum compressive strength of 15. 88 MPa and 15. 57 MPa was achieved for the ratio 2 : 3 : 3 : 2 and 2 : 3 : 4 : 1. A minimum of 12. 45 MPa and 11. 67 MPa was achieved for 1 : 3 : 4 : 2 and 2 : 1 : 5 : 2 respectively. Moreover the bulk density of the sample also decreased. A maximum of 2. 61 g/cm 3 was achieved for a 30 % sludge content and a minimum of 1. 983 g/cm 3 for a sludge content of 50 %. This was attributed due to the organic properties present in the brick. Moreover the water absorption percentage increased with the increased sludge percentage. With a minimum of 0. 22 % was achieved for 30 % to a maximum of 0. 28 % for 50 %...|$|E

40|$|Sludge {{remaining}} at {{water treatment}} plants is an inescapable {{byproduct of the}} water treatment process. The nature of sludge depends on suspended solids of raw water, coagulant type and chemicals {{that are used in}} the treatment process. Direct discharge of sludge into water bodies result in the risk of contamination of surface and ground water that affects water quality and aquatic biota. According to existing legislation, water treatment sludge is classified under industrial waste. Therefore, it is anticipated that the water treatment process would be legislated as a licensable activity in the near future. The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) which is the main potable water supplier in Sri Lanka, has paid attention to identify disposal routes, sustainable practices, and potential applications of water treatment sludge. The objective of this research was to recognize disposal practices and cost effective methods that conform to environmental regulations. To fulfill the objectives, a questionnaire survey was conducted pertaining to chemical usage, sludge production, sludge handling and disposal methods. To introduce sustainable practices, a series of experiments were conducted by adding sludge into production of burnt clay brick, replacing <b>cement</b> by <b>sludge</b> as an adhesive fine material in cement mortar and replacing sand by sludge as fine aggregate in Concrete Paving Blocks (CPB). The questionnaire survey revealed that 50 % of selected treatment plants that are operated by NWSDB directly discharge the sludge into inland surface waters with no treatment or dispose to bare lands. Experimental results showed that the required compressive strength of burnt brick could be achieved by adding sludge up to 10 % for load bearing walls of single storey buildings. Further, replacement of <b>cement</b> by <b>sludge</b> up to 30 % in cement mortar, achieved the required flow of 105 % to 115 % with the water cement ratio between 0. 7 and 1. 1. Required compressive strength of cement mortar could be achieved with the addition of 10 % sludge with the water cement ratios of 0. 7, 0. 9 & 1. 1, 20 % sludge with the water cement ratios of 0. 7 & 0. 9 and 30 % of sludge with the water cement ratio of 0. 7. The suitability of a CPB depends on its compliance to the compressive strength requirements. The results showed, the addition of 10 % sludge as fine aggregate and 10 % bottom ash and sludge as fine aggregate satisfies the requirement specified in the SLS standards for class 1. Hence Concrete Paving Blocks can be successfully produced using 10 % of water treatment plant sludge as supplement for sand.

The project work was divided into the two subprojects "Emplacement and Borehole Sealing Techniques" (EBT) and "Retrievable Emplacement Test" (REV) with different working priorities and objectives. The present report documents the status of work achieved by the end of 1992 in the "Retrievable Emplacement Test" subproject.

The planned emplacement test, lasting a maximum of five years, was intended to simulate the operating phase of boreholes filled with a comparable waste spectrum in a future repository in salt.

On the basis of the measured data and investigation results from two thermally heated boreholes in operation since 1989 precursory tests), it will be demonstrated that the waste packages could have been emplaced in the three remaining boreholes, similarly equipped, without the retrievability of the packages having been endangered from the geomechanical point of view. Furthermore, it can be inferred from the experience gathered during theapproximately four-year period of the precursory tests that during the emplacement test safe monitoring of the convergence movement of the boreholes would have been ensured. A description of the design features of the measuring and monitoring equipment already installed in the test drift EV and the shielding, handling, transport and lifting devices ready for installation at the Asse mine and tested in 1 : 1 scale set-ups will demonstrate retrospectively that the technical preconditions foremplacement/retrieval of the waste packages and for experimental investigations of the gas release into the borehole atmosphere to be expected during package emplacement due to interaction processes had largely been prepared.

40|$|This study {{describes}} the characterization and product identification of sludge that is {{obtained from the}} recycling of spent lubricant into base oil. Sludge is produced from the recuperation of spent lubricant which involves two main processes. The first process is to produce the solvent that will be used. The solvent consists of Hexane, Isopropanol (IPA) and Potassium hydroxide (KOH). The next process is the recuperation of used lubricant using the solvent produced. The ratio of spent lubricant and solvent used is 1 : 4. Physical mixing is then used to produce a natural reaction between the solvent and spent lubricant. The mixture is stirred continuously for 30 minutes. The stirred mixture is then filtered. There {{are two ways to}} filter the mixture. One is by centrifugation and the other is filtration with thin filter papers. The residue that is left behind is the sludge {{that is going to be}} used for the characterization process. Many parameters of the sludge is investigated and characterized before product identification is done. Both physical and chemical parameters are investigated. The parameters investigated are pH, density, viscosity, heavy metal content and chemical composition of the sludge. The pH of sludge on average is 6. 59 with an average density of 0. 9041 g/ml or 904. 13 kg/m 3. The average viscosity is 1419 cP. There is a fair amount of heavy metals present in the sludge and its chemical composition consists of paraffin and olefins. From the results obtained, the sludge can be singled out for its major components and the contents can be derived into useful products. Three different products are identified. The sludge can be used as raw material for pyrolysis where the end product obtained is a diesel like liquid and also as concrete or <b>cement</b> additive. The <b>sludge</b> can also be used as grease...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} {{of sewage sludge}} (SS) from {{waste water treatment plant}} is increasing all over the world. Disposal of sewage sludge is becoming a serious environmental issues to our society. Sewage sludge which contain high heavy metal is no longer suitable to be used as fertilizer. Besides, the land fill, which is the main disposal method has also posed threat to leachate of heavy metal from the sewage sludge to the soil. Due to fast urbanization, the demand of cement has increased alarmingly. This will lead to increased cement production and emission of carbon dioxide because the cement industry one of the major contributor of carbon dioxide emission. Hence, the research for replacement of <b>cement</b> using sewage <b>sludge</b> ash is essential to reduce both the emissions of carbon dioxide and the disposal problem of sewage sludge ash. In this investigation, sewage sludge ash has been used as partial cement replacement in concrete. The sewage sludge is incinerated at the temperature of 600 °C and a duration of three hours. The incinerated sewage sludge ash is sieved through sieve size of 150 µm. Four different percentages of sewage sludge ash (SSA) is used to replace the cement in the concrete. XRD and XRF tests were carried to compared the result between SS, SSA and cement. The test conducted on concrete in this investigation were slump test, water absorption and water absorption. Results show that SSA has the potential to replace cement since there are high similarity in major chemical component of SSA compared to cement. The replacement of cement in concrete with 5 % SSA has shown lower water absorption and increase compressive strength of concrete up to 10 % as compared with the control sample...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to explore the reuse potential of the chemical sludge (considered as hazardous waste as per Indian Government Hazardous Waste Management Rules) generated from combined effluent treatment in textile clusters. These textile clusters mainly cover the cotton dyeing and printing operations. Approach: Therefore, treatability studies of chemical sludge were conducted using solidification/stabilization treatment to examine the possibility of its reuse in construction materials. The sludge was characterised for its physico-chemical parameters and heavy metals. Standard blocks of dimensions 70. 6 × 70. 6 × 70. 6 mm were prepared, in which chemical sludge was used as a partial replacement of cement by mixing 30 - 70 % of <b>sludge</b> in <b>cement.</b> After the experimental curing, the blocks were evaluated for physical engineering properties such as hardening time, block density, unconfined compressive strength. The chemical properties were determined in terms of concentrations of heavy metals in the TCLP leachate. Results: The hardening time ranged between 30 - 45 h. The compressive strength in the <b>sludge</b> <b>cement</b> blocks ranged from 2. 63 - 22. 54 N mm - 2 after 14 days of water curing and 6. 48 - 24. 89 N mmm - 2 after 28 days of water curing for 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 % <b>sludge</b> replacement in <b>cement.</b> The block density varied between 1361. 3408 - 1813. 8992 Kg m - 3 after 14 days and 1386. 3953 - 1842. 3446 Kg m - 3 after 28 days of water curing. The concentrations of heavy metals were negligible in the TCLP leachate and thus below USEPA regulatory limits. Conclusion/Recommendations: As far as structural applications is concerned, it is fulfilling the criteria of some of the classes (C to K) as per the BIS standards of the bricks upto a strength of 25 N mm&# 61485; 2. The use of sludge can definitely be explored for other structural and non-structural applications depending upon strength requirement.

40|$|Over 300 million {{tones of}} {{industrial}} wastes are being produced per annum by chemical and agricultural process in India. These materials pose problems of disposal and health hazards. The wastes like phosphogypsum, fluorogypsum and red mud contain obnoxious impurities which adversely affect {{the strength and}} other properties of building materials based on them. Out of several wastes being produced at present, the use of phosphogypsum, fluorogypsum, lime sludge, hypo sludge, red mud, and mine tailing is of paramount significance to protect the environment. Paper making generally produces {{a large amount of}} solid waste. Paper fibers can be recycled {{only a limited number of}} times before they become too short or weak to make high quality paper. It means that the broken, low-quality paper fibers are separated out to become waste sludge. All the inks, dyes, coatings, pigments, staples and ”stickies” (tape, plastic films, etc.) are also washed off the recycled fibers to join the waste solids. The shiny finish on glossy magazine-type paper is produced using a fine kaolin clay coating, which also becomes solid waste during recycling. This paper mill sludge consumes a large percentage of local landfill space for each and every year. Worse yet, some of the wastes are land spread on cropland as a disposal technique, raising concerns about trace contaminants building up in soil or running off into area lakes and streams. Some companies burn their sludge in incinerators, contributing to our serious air pollution problems. To reduce disposal and pollution problems emanating from these industrial wastes, it is most essential to develop profitable building materials from them. Keeping this in view, investigations were undertaken to produce low cast concrete by blending various ratios of <b>cement</b> with hypo <b>sludge.</b> This project is concerned with experimental investigation on strength of concrete and optimum percentage of the partial replacement by replacing cement via 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 %, 60 % and 70 % of Hypo Sludge...|$|R
