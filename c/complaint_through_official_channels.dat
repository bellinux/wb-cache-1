25|$|Both North West and Hudson’s Bay {{companies}} formally {{protested the}} proclamation, but Lord Selkirk, being the majority shareholder of the HBC {{was able to}} deal with his company’s <b>complaints</b> <b>through</b> <b>official</b> <b>channels.</b> Special Commissioner Coltman, the government official later charged with investigating the Battle of Seven Oaks, suggested that Gov. Macdonell waited for an opportune moment to release his proclamation, the idea of which he had brought up some time earlier, and suggested that moment was the American victory at the Battle of Lake Erie which occurred September 10, 1813 which gave the Americans command of Lake Erie and threatened the NWC’s ability to transport goods, furs and provisions over the Great Lakes. Issuing the proclamation at this time therefore would have starved the Nor’westers out of the region. In fact, the Nor’Westers would later testify that the British loss of Lake Erie rendered the company more dependent on the Red River pemmican than ever. The NWC disregarded the proclamation and Gov. Macdonell was obliged to enforce it.|$|R

I understand that", explaining that, [...] "I never told my parents.... I never told anybody."

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the extent to}} which type and labeling of harassment have an impact on reporting <b>through</b> <b>official</b> <b>channels.</b> Reinforcing earlier analyses, type of harassment impacted whether individuals reported incidents officially. Environmental harassment was far more likely to be reported <b>through</b> <b>official</b> <b>channels.</b> We speculate that “individualized ” forms of harassment (personal, frequently directly physical in nature, leaving little room for misinterpretation by the victim or the perpetrator) may create a negative organizational image and therefore be more likely to be concealed. Since experiencing environmental harassment is strongly related to experiencing individualized harassment and {{is more likely to be}} reported <b>through</b> <b>official</b> <b>channels,</b> it may be the real key to creating zero-tolerance for any type of sexual harassment...|$|R
