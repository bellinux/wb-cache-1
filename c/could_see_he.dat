500|$|Daavettila {{graduated}} from Michigan Tech in 2008 and tried {{out for the}} Flint Generals of the International Hockey League (IHL). He appeared in two games for the Generals {{at the end of}} the season (for only about three shifts), and did not register a point. Daavettila had not originally planned to pursue a professional hockey career, but said [...] "When I got one skate with Flint, it kind of sparked my interest and I decided to give it a try". During the off-season, Daavettila worked for a structural engineering firm in Saginaw, Michigan. He used vacation time at the start of the next hockey season later in 2008 to try out for the Grand Rapids Griffins of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Muskegon Lumberjacks (IHL), though he was rejected by both teams. Tryouts with two more IHL teams, the Kalamazoo Wings and the Bloomington PrairieThunder, did not result in a contract either. Daavettila assumed his hockey career was over and went back to his engineering job, but he continued to skate a couple times a week. He had left an impression on Kalamazoo coach Nick Bootland, however, who called Daavettila back in March 2009 after his team was depleted by injuries. [...] "You <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> had a skill set," [...] said Bootland. [...] "But I thought the way he held on to the puck, he was going to get himself killed. ... You kept thinking he was going to make a mistake. Then he'd pop a guy for a breakaway." ...|$|E

Budd would later recall, [...] "We met when we were both 14. He {{was the only other}} kid I knew with an electric guitar. Even at 14 you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> was a genius". Borland played guitar left-handed.|$|E
2500|$|The Mikado {{has been}} admired by other composers. Dame Ethel Smyth wrote of Sullivan, [...] "One day he {{presented}} {{me with a}} copy of the full score of The Golden Legend, adding: 'I think this is the best thing I've done, don't you?' and when truth compelled me to say that in my opinion The Mikado is his masterpiece, he cried out: 'O you wretch!' But though he laughed, I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> was disappointed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jean Désiré Gustave Courbet ( [...] ; 10 June 1819 [...] 31 December 1877) was a French {{painter who}} led the Realism {{movement}} in 19th-century French painting. Committed to painting only what he <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>he</b> rejected academic convention and the Romanticism of the previous generation of visual artists. His independence set an example that was important to later artists, such as the Impressionists and the Cubists. Courbet occupies an important place in 19th-century French painting as an innovator and as an artist willing to make bold social statements through his work.|$|E
2500|$|Cruceta {{returned}} to Buffalo for the [...] season, but doubts developed about his role. He struggled as a starter, {{and attempts to}} convert him into a relief pitcher met with mixed results. Manager Marty Brown was open in his criticism of Cruceta's efforts to become a reliever, and acknowledged that, when he had Cruceta start a game in mid-August, [...] "You <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> felt more comfortable in that starting role than out of the bullpen. That's a real positive for him." [...] Just {{a few days after}} that start, the Indians designated him for assignment. The Seattle Mariners claimed him off waivers and sent him to the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers.|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} Jimmy had {{a little}} bit of trouble with the solo on [...] "Stairway to Heaven"... e hadn't completely figured it out. Nowadays you sometimes spend a whole day doing one thing. Back then, we never did that. We never spent a very long time recording anything. I remember sitting in the control room with Jimmy, he's standing there next to me and he'd done quite a few passes and it wasn't going anywhere. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> was getting a bit paranoid and so I was getting paranoid. I turned around and said [...] "You're making me paranoid!" [...] And he said, [...] "No, you're making me paranoid!" [...] It was a silly circle of paranoia. Then bang! On the next take or two he ripped it out.|$|E
60|$|Miller was shaken. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that. <b>He</b> sat {{like one}} who has been dealt a {{stunning}} blow.|$|R
60|$|Later {{in the day}} {{he came to me}} again. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> {{had made}} no fresh discovery.|$|R
60|$|I {{wished that}} his face were visible so that I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> if <b>he</b> still smiled when he uttered those words.|$|R
2500|$|On September 10, 2006, Ali was {{endorsed}} by The Washington Post which one county political veteran ranked as only behind that of the Democratic Party for its influence on local voters. The Post said “Political newcomer Saqib Ali has shown good command of issues and would bring new vigor to this district's delegation.” [...] On September Sept. 20, 2006, it was announced Ali had won the Democratic primary in Maryland's 39th Legislative District, defeating incumbent Delegate Joan F. Stern {{for a position on}} the slate with Del's Nancy J. King and Charles E. Barkley for the November general election. Stern had lost the outright endorsement of King and Barkley as she was not seen as a team-player. King noted that [...] "Ali was a 'breath of fresh air' to voters", while political veteran Gene Counihan said [...] "As far as I <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>he</b> followed the book on how to win an election. I saw him on the campaign trail more than anybody. He was out door-to-door; he had impressive literature. He wanted it." [...] Ali ascribed his electoral victory to connecting with voters. [...] "Our campaign had a lot of energy. It had that underdog feel that struck a chord with people and resonated. When you talk to real voters, not the insiders, they care if you pay attention to them. They remember that you listened to them. People appreciate new blood." ...|$|E
2500|$|Youzhny {{was born}} on 25 June 1982 to Mikhail, a Soviet army colonel and Lubov, a {{professional}} tennis player. 25 June is also his father's birthday. His father sacrificed {{his career in the}} Soviet army to steer Youzhny and his older brother Andrei into becoming tennis players. It was because of his father that Boris Sobkin became his coach. At 13, he was a ballboy for a Russia – United States Davis Cup final in Moscow. Youzhny's father was recommended that Mikhail and his brother should join the tennis club Spartak Club if they wanted to become professional players. Mikhail and Andrei had to travel on an underground metro train and then on two buses to reach their destination, taking well over an hour to reach the club. His mother had to take a part-time job to pay for their club membership fees. At Spartak Club, Youzhny, along with many others his age, would watch Andrei Chesnokov, a former top-10 player, practice for hours. However, his parents had difficulty finding a good coach for Mikhail and Andrei. According to Mikhail, [...] "It was not so easy. In the beginning me and Andrei would watch how coaches were working with students. Then we would make our own drills with a bag of old balls that we collected." [...] Remembering Youzhny's early years, Sobkin said, [...] "Mischa and Andrei were practising together all the time without [...] coach". Sobkin continued: [...] "In the beginning, Mischa is all the time breaking racquets and crying. Not so many coaches want to work with boy with strong character like this. So, they would practise on one court for 15 minutes and then comes a member so they must leave court immediately and move to another court. Ten minutes maybe 20 minutes later comes another member and like this all day. There was something in Mischa's eyes, a sparkle, maybe, I don't know. Sometimes the eyes tells more than parents. Of course, I did not see Mischa is Top 10 player then. But I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> had something special." ...|$|E

60|$|Chauncey Dike {{stopped in}} his tracks and haw-hawed with laughter. But I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> was not very much pleased.|$|R
60|$|The {{poor little}} man <b>could</b> not <b>see.</b> <b>He</b> <b>could</b> only cough and gasp and wipe {{his face with}} his coat-tails.|$|R
6000|$|... "Me! Me, of {{all people}} in the world!" [...] he {{repeated}} portentously. But I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> was frightened. Such want of tact! ...|$|R
60|$|But he {{grew tired}} of looking around, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> was {{beginning}} to get frightened.|$|E
60|$|Coleyard tore it open hurriedly. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> was agitated. His {{face grew}} white at once.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} George doubtfully. Harold {{looking down}} <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> {{was holding the}} lantern above his head and staring at something very hard.|$|R
60|$|He {{nodded his}} head, {{and even in}} the gloom I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> was smiling the gentle, wistful smile which I {{connected}} with him.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} me very intently to see if I were mocking. He laughed. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> was very much moved.|$|E
60|$|I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> {{was working}} rapidly with his hands. When he {{returned}} to me the sweat was heavy on his forehead.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Henry {{was in the}} steward's room, {{affecting}} employment, but I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> {{was only}} impatient to hear of my errand.|$|E
60|$|His {{face grew}} a trifle more animated; I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> was recovering. The dumb stupor which had held his {{features}} rigid was passing away.|$|R
60|$|I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> as <b>he</b> {{looked down}} {{that he was}} {{repressing}} some internal emotion. His features were still composed, but his eyes shone with amused exultation.|$|R
60|$|My ready {{acquiescence}} pleased him. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> was relieved. I {{think he}} had expected me to jib {{at the prospect of}} actual work.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah. Anybody <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> was a {{druggist}} {{from that}} line about the tinctures and syrups. It's a fine tribute to our profession." ...|$|E

60|$|Again {{he looked}} where {{the waste of}} sea {{churning}} amongst the sunken rocks had been. He could hear the roaring of waters, the thunder of great waves beating on the iron-bound coast; but nothing <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>see.</b> <b>He</b> was alone on the wild sea; in the dark.|$|R
