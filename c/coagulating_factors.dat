Treatment of iatrogenic femoral artery pseudoaneurysm with the injection of thrombin is reported to be an efficacious and safe procedure. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and success rate of percutaneous ultrasonographically-guided thrombin injection and compression method for the treatment of pseudoaneurysm and for studying of the effect of thrombin injection on systemic coagulation parameters. This cohort clinical trial was conducted on patients with femoral pseudoaneurysm after percutaneous intervention (PCI) in Shaheed Rajaie Cardiovascular Medical and Research Center. The patients were divided into two randomized groups and treated with either the compression method or the percutaneous ultrasonographically-guided thrombin injection method. Pseudoaneurysm size, pseudoaneurysm neck size, thrombin dose, thrombosis time, outcome of therapy, and complications were documented prospectively. Duplex sonographic follow-up examinations were performed at 0 and 24 hours afterwards. Partial thrombin time as well as the Quick test (prothrombin time) was monitored before and after the intervention. Thirty patients between 15 and 85 years of age with femoral pseudoaneurysm following catheterization were enrolled in this study. The average length and width of the pseudoaneurysms were respectively 2. 45 ± 1. 15 cm and 2. 06 ± 1. 07 cm. In total, 13 thrombin injections were administered.

40|$|Every fifth patient {{admitted}} to a general hospital misuses alcohol. Long-term alcoholic patients undergoing surgery have a 5 -fold higher risk of postoperative bleeding complications than non-alcoholics. It is important to develop and establish suitable algorithms to diagnosis and therapy. A relevant complication in surgery is particularly the bleeding inclination by thrombocytes and coagulating disorder, which frequently lead to an increased blood loss. In order to reduce this risk, we examined whether a stimulation of haemostasis {{can be achieved by}} DDAVP given to alcoholic patients. The investigation was put as a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled pilot study. 60 ASA 1 and 2 patients (29 men, 31 women) of the orthopedic hospital, which received a elektive hip or knee joint endoprosthesis (TEP) and/or spinal column instrumentation, were included. 32 were identified as alcoholics and 28 as non-alcoholics after application of the DSM IV criteria, CAGE question, the daily alcohol drinking quantity and alcoholism-relevant laboratory parameter (CDT, GGT, MCV and BAC). After exclusion 6 patients before intervention 27 patients kept DDAVP postoperative and 12 hours later (Minirin® Ferring, Kiel, Germany) in the usual dose from 0, 3 µg/Kg body weight as short infusion, and 27 patients received similar the placebo preparation (0. 9 % NaCl).

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the pathogenesis of}} bleeding tendency in vascular surgery in elderly patients, the serial changes in various parameters of coagulation and fibrinolysis were investigated perioperatively in 30 patients undergoing vascular surgery and in 18 patients undergoing general surgery (control). The platelet count, platelet aggregability and plasminogen activity were lower {{in the group of}} vascular surgery than in the control group perioperatively. Thrombin-antithrombin Ⅲ complex(TAT) and plasmin-α(2) plasmin inhibitor complex(PIC) levels were high during operation. Postoperatively, the TAT level gradually decreased but the D-dimer level was high postoperatively. Although platelet aggregability increased significantly with age in the group of general surgery, it tended to decrease in that of vascular surgery. TAT and PIC levels tended to increase but the α(2) plasmin inhibitor(α(2) PI) and fibrinogen levels tended to decrease with age. In 22 patients undergoing graft replacement with abdominal aortic aneurysm, a negative correlation was observed between preoperative α(2) PI and intraoperative blood loss. However, a positive correlation was evident between the preoperative PIC level and intraoperative blood loss. These findings suggest that in vascular surgery, activities of coagulation and fibrinolysis increase and the postoperative hypercoagulable state is transient, although secondary fibrinolysis is stationary in a high level, and that in elderly patients with vascular disorders <b>coagulating</b> <b>factor</b> and anti-fibrinolytic factor tend to decrease.

The study size computed for 1000 CAD and 1000 control patients with a power of 80 % and a Bonferroni corrected error of 0. 007. The diagnosis of CAD was placed by means of coronary angiography and both populations were phenotyped extensively regarding anthropometric and laboratory-chemical parameters. Polymorphisms of platelet glycoproteins (GP) IIIa, Ia, Ib, coagulation factor VII, angiotensin-II-type- 1 -receptor, endothelial NO Synthase (ENOS), methylentetrahydrofolic-acid-reductase, G-protein  3, paraoxonase I and  3 -receptor were determined.

As gender specific characteristic a gene environmental interaction showed up between high numbers of CA repeats and Homocystein: in women with hyperhomocysteinemia the risk for acute coronary syndromes rose {{as a function of}} the number of CA repeats drastically. The - 5 C variants in the Kozak sequence of the GP Ib was associated with a relative risk for acute coronary syndrome of 1. 43; CI: 1. 05  1. 95; p = 0. 02. Regarding the coronary risk the remaining polymorphisms were significantly associated neither with an excess risk nor protection. Concerning procedural complications after catheter interventions carriers of the - 5 C variants in the Kozak sequence of GP Ib showed a 3. 75 time increased risk with PTCA (OR = 3. 75; CI: 1. 15  12. 27; p = 0. 013).

In the current study, the pro-coagulant property has been investigated further and the results are presented. The Hag-protease reduced the re-calcification time of citrated human plasma. It reduced the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and prothrombin time (PT) suggesting its participation in common pathway of blood coagulation. Interestingly, it coagulated the citrated human plasma in the absence of CaCl 2 but, it was lacking thrombin-like activity as it did not clot the purified fibrinogen. Strikingly, the enzyme <b>coagulated</b> the <b>factor</b> X deficient congenital human plasma, suggesting the factor Xa-like activity. However, the cumulative augmented activity was observed in presence of CaCl 2 and phospholipids. Further, the Hag-protease preferentially hydrolyzed the AÎ± chain and then the BÎ²-chain, but not the Î³-chain. As a result, truncated fibrinogen generated was lacking in the polymerization property. It hydrolyzed all the subunits of partially cross-liked fibrin clot (Î±-polymer, Î±-chain, Î²-chain, and Î³-Î³ dimers). Further, at low concentrations, the Hag-protease stimulated the aggregation of human platelets in platelet rich plasma, but at high concentrations caused spontaneous clumping. In contrast, it inhibited the collagen induced aggregation of washed human platelets.

It {{is unclear how}} these cells respond under physiological conditions, where the serine proteases factor VIIa, factor Xa and thrombin are all simultaneously generated, as in tissue factor-driven blood coagulation. We studied the Ca 2 + signaling and downstream release of interleukins (ILs), induced by these proteases in monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In single cells, factor Xa, but not factor VIIa, complexed with tissue factor, evoked a greatly delayed, oscillatory Ca 2 + response, which relied on its catalytic activity and resembled that of SLIGRL, a peptide specifically activating the protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR 2). Thrombin even at low concentrations evoked a rapid, mostly non-oscillating Ca 2 + response through activation of PAR 1, which reinforced the factor Xa response. The additive Ca 2 + signals persisted, when factor X and prothrombin were activated in situ, or {{in the presence of}} plasma that was triggered to <b>coagulate</b> with tissue <b>factor.</b> Further, thrombin reinforced the factor Xa-induced production of IL- 8, but not of IL- 6.
