In an attempt to elaborate a continuous flow microwave dryer, the optimum operating characteristics of a prototype microwave antenna were investigated during a low power microwave drying simulation with corn at three different moisture content levels (15 %, 23 % and 30 % w. b.). The antenna consisted of a slotted waveguide with the orientation and width of the slots being the main points of investigation. The optimum angle of the slots with respect to the direction of propagation of the travelling wave was found to be in the neighbourhood of 55 ° at all moisture <b>contents.</b> <b>Slots</b> 13 mm wide gave better results than the 6 mm ones which are often suggested in literature...|$|R

The sheller {{consists of a}} feed hopper with a flow rate control device, shelling unit, separating unit and power system. Nine different impellers {{were used for the}} investigation at three different pod moisture contents.

40|$|The retail {{practice}} of charging a fee to stock new products {{is a relatively}} new but growing phenomenon. Termed a "slotting allowance", it has attracted considerable scrutiny because of uncertainty about its purposes and consequences. We propose and statistically test several hypotheses to assess the degree of empirical support for each of several extant explanations. Slotting allowances, we find, are charged by relatively large retailers who have an informational advantage over the manufacturer about the likely success of the new product. This result apparently contradicts theorizing about the "informational" <b>content</b> of <b>slotting</b> fees, as well as other pro- and anti-competitive explanations. We also find support for the claim that when retailers fear that manufacturers will not provide post-launch support, they pay relatively high wholesale prices.

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: Offset Double-Disk Opener (DDO) is {{a popular}} furrow opener in {{conservation}} tillage. It has some limitations such as negative suction to penetrate in the soil, hair pinning and mixing seed and fertilizer in the slot. Because of importance of separation of seed and fertilizer in the slot, by adding two horizontal mini disks to DDO a modified opener was made (MDO) which placed the fertilizer between and under two rows of seed. Approach: To consider performance of novel opener an indoor comparison test between DDO and MDO was performed at soil bin. The experiment was conducted with three working speeds (3, 6 and 8 km h− 1), two bulk densities of soil (1. 1 and 1. 4 Mg m− 3) and two levels of residues (1 and 2 ton ha− 1). The experimental design consisted in a (3 × 2 × 2) complete randomized factorial with three replicates for each test. Moisture of seed furrow, separation of seed and fertilizer, hair pinning and resultant forces acting on the openers were used as assessing indexes. Results: There {{was no significant difference}} between soil moisture <b>content</b> in <b>slots</b> created by DDO and MDO at 0 - 4 cm depth, but at 4 - 8 cm the in the slot created by MDO moisture content was higher about 9 %.

40|$|Queueing {{systems with}} batch service have been {{investigated}} extensively during the past decades. However, nearly all the studied models share the common feature that an uncorrelated arrival process is considered, which is unrealistic in several real-life situations. In this paper, we study a discrete-time queueing model, with a server that only initiates service when the amount of customers in system (system content) reaches or exceeds a threshold. Correlation is taken into account by assuming a discrete batch Markovian arrival process (D-BMAP), i. e. {{the distribution of the}} number of customer arrivals per slot depends on a background state which is determined by a first-order Markov chain. We deduce the probability generating function of the system <b>content</b> at random <b>slot</b> marks and we examine the influence of correlation in the arrival process on the behavior of the system. We show that correlation merely has a small impact on the threshold that minimizes the mean system content. In addition, we demonstrate that correlation might have a significant influence on the system content and therefore has {{to be included in the}} model...|$|R

In soft soil with heavy residues some trash was pushed by DDO into seed furrow (hair pinning) but at MDO seed were placed at clean groove. Lateral and vertical separation of seed and fertilizer was performed effectively by MDO (4. 5 and 5 cm, respectively) while DDO put seed and fertilizer close to each other. Conclusion: Overall, the Modified Offset Double-disks (MDO) had better performance.

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a complete development platform that features different innovative acceleration strategies, {{not included in}} any other current platform, that simplify and speed up {{the definition of the}} different elements required to design a spoken dialog service. The proposed accelerations are mainly based on using the information from the backend database schema and contents, as well as cumulative information produced throughout the different steps in the design. Thanks to these accelerations, the interaction between the designer and the platform is improved, and in most cases the design is reduced to simple confirmations of the “proposals” that the platform dynamically provides at each step. In addition, the platform provides several other accelerations such as configurable templates {{that can be used to}} define the different tasks in the service or the dialogs to obtain or show information to the user, automatic proposals for the best way to request <b>slot</b> <b>contents</b> from the user (i. e. using mixed-initiative forms or directed forms), an assistant that offers the set of more probable actions required to complete the definition of the different tasks in the application, or another assistant for solving specific modality details such as confirmations of user answers or how to present them the lists of retrieved results after querying the backend database. Additionally, the platform also allows the creation of speech grammars and prompts, database access functions, and the possibility of using mixed initiative and over-answering dialogs. In the paper we also describe in detail each assistant in the platform, emphasizing the different kind of methodologies followed to facilitate the design process at each one. Finally, {{we describe}} the results obtained in both a subjective and an objective evaluation with different designers that confirm the viability, usefulness, and functionality of the proposed accelerations. Thanks to the accelerations, the design time is reduced in more than 56...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} Māori media use {{and participation}} in Aotearoa/ New Zealand. A number of news media formats are examined and consideration is given to what the most effective formats for Māori communications are. It is argued throughout the thesis that the commercial imperatives of mainstream media compromise the potential for Māori participation and content. It is asserted that the ideal media model for Māori communication {{is a combination of}} big and small media, with Māori active partnership and inclusion of Māori <b>content</b> in prime-time <b>slots</b> within mainstream media and with Māori-controlled media serving the diversity of Māori cultural needs and the demands for local communication. The thesis argues that Māori participation in the news media is vital for Māori self-identity and self-determination because both printed and electronic media are major sources of information about local, national and global issues. It describes how the European colonisers defined Māori people as “the Other” and denigrated their language and culture, and it argues that the current Pākehā-dominated media have continued this process. In view of this, the thesis contends that the advances in electronic media now make it possible for Māori people not only to access the media, but to control their own media, redressing this cultural disadvantage by setting their own information and cultural agendas, producing new cultural forms and methods of distribution. At the same time, the thesis notices how political rhetoric about the media being used for te reo Māori regeneration and Māori education and development, in practice lacked adequate complementary policies and funding. Finally, the thesis details the commitment of Māori broadcasters and publishers in Aotearoa/ New Zealand to using radio, television, online and print publications for Māori communication despite this lack of support...|$|R
