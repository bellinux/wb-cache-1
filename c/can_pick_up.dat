5|$|The player {{controls}} Diermot's {{movements and}} actions with a mouse or a gamepad. Diermot <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> various objects; these {{can then be}} used with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. He can also engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of {{what needs to be}} done to solve the puzzles or progress the plot. A few simple action-oriented battle scenes are also included.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the player}} has no direct {{control over the}} patients, they have some {{influence}} over whether to evict them from the hospital and in determining {{what to do with}} them when given a choice by the staff. The player <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> any staff member in the building and move them (mainly to reassign them to another room or send them to get rest), or dismiss them if they argue about pay or are no longer required. The player may force patients to take a chance at a cure for their suspected disease before diagnosis is complete (at the risk of killing the patient), and rearrange queues.|$|E
5|$|Carolyn Porco of NASA was {{consulted}} on {{the planetary}} science and imagery. The animators realistically recreated what an explosion {{would look like}} in space: short blasts, which suck inward and leave debris from a ship floating. For shots of an imploding planet, the same explosion program was used to simulate it breaking up, while the animators could manually composite multiple layers of rocks and wind sucking into the planet. Unlike other Star Trek films and series, the transporter beam effects swirl rather than speckle. Abrams conceived the redesign to emphasize the notion of transporters as beams that <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> and move people, rather than a signal composed of scrambled atoms.|$|E
50|$|Most {{people get}} their {{television}} either through Shaw Direct, Bell TV or over-the-air. Five channels <b>can</b> be <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> reliably using an outdoor antenna while an additional five channels <b>can</b> be <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> semi-reliably. There {{are at least}} 14 channels that <b>can</b> be <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> over-the-air only during sunny days where clouds are absent.|$|R
50|$|Klondike {{is able to}} fire {{his weapon}} {{straight}} or diagonally up or down. Some enemies are harmless, but obstructive while others cause Klondike damage on impact or with projectiles. Traps are also present throughout the levels. Canisters <b>can</b> be <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> for health, stars <b>can</b> be <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> for powerups (or the occasional harmful stars) and guns <b>can</b> be <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> for ammunition.|$|R
50|$|Health Recharge: This {{power-up}} {{increases the}} player's health until it runs out. If their health is low, they <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> this <b>up</b> and recharge themselves until they <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> another power-up or it runs out. The max health {{they can have}} is 175. Players <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> this <b>up</b> from the map or when they kill someone.|$|R
5|$|For {{the first}} few days, the newborn is {{unsteady}} on its feet, and needs the support of its mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up,</b> hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.|$|E
5|$|On {{a garden}} scale, the berries should be picked when dry and ripe. Commercially, most {{harvesting}} is done mechanically by straddle harvesters. These move continually down the rows, straddling {{a row of}} bushes, shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit. The blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time, some machines have cross conveyors which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row. A modern machine <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> to fifty tonnes of blackcurrants in a day using only one operator and two tractor drivers. The bins should be stored in a cool place. Some fruit is still picked by hand {{for use in the}} fresh fruit market.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{is divided into}} several missions that the player has to complete while fighting enemies and completing objectives. Objectives range from rescuing hostages to exploring areas and recovering items such as keycards, explosives or laptop computers, which are useful to hack into electronic devices. The player <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> new weapons, health and ammunition dropped by enemies if necessary. The game also features several mini-games, including a driving level and a sniper mission, as well as numerous boss battles that the player has to defeat in order to progress through the next level. By beating any of these mini-games, the player can access them in the game's extras menu.|$|E
50|$|Transmitters {{located near}} to {{international}} borders may overspill {{into a large}} part of a neighbouring country, for example the signal from Republic of Ireland broadcaster 2RN's Clermont Carn site <b>can</b> be <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> in a large swathe of Northern Ireland, and vice versa BBC broadcasts <b>can</b> be <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> in the Republic.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{geographic}} {{constraints and}} the waning nature of over-the-air television, only one channel (CIII-DT) can be reliably received at all times. Four over-the-air channels <b>can</b> be <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> semi-reliably while {{at least eight}} other channels <b>can</b> only be <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> on clear sunny days.|$|R

5|$|Wipeout is {{a racing}} game that {{is set in}} 2052, where players compete in the F3600 anti-gravity racing league. The game allows the player to pilot one of a {{selection}} of craft in races on several different tracks. There are four racing teams to choose from, and two ships for each team. Each ship has its distinct characteristics of acceleration, top speed, mass, and turning radius. By piloting their craft over power-up pads found on the tracks, the player <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> various weapons and power-ups such as shields, turbo boosts, mines, shock waves, rockets, or missiles. The power-ups allow the player to either protect their craft or disrupt the competitors' craft.|$|E
5|$|Before {{entering}} a stage, the player {{begins in the}} Attraction Information Center, which acts as a hub world. Here, the player can choose a partner and a level to enter, and see which attractions they have already completed. Bonus levels are hidden throughout the zones and can also be triggered by finishing a zone with 20 or more rings. In the bonus levels, the player is free falling and <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> power-ups as they proceed. Special stages can be entered if finishing a zone with 50 or more rings. In these, the player must collect blue spheres in a forward-scrolling platformer; players are rewarded with a Chaos Ring upon completion. Collecting all Chaos Rings rewards the player with the best possible ending, in which Sonic and Tails make cameo appearances.|$|E
5|$|Mario's {{abilities}} in Super Mario 64 {{are far more}} diverse than those of previous Mario games. The player can make Mario walk, run, jump, crouch, crawl, swim, climb, kick, or punch using the game controller's analog stick and buttons. Special jumps can be executed by combining a regular jump with other actions, including the double and triple jumps (jumping two and {{three times in a}} row, respectively), long jump and backflip. There are also special maneuvers, such as wall jumpingâ€”jumping from one wall to another in rapid succession to reach areas that would otherwise be too high. The player <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> and carry certain items, an ability which is used to solve various puzzles, and swim underwater at various speeds. Mario's life energy slowly diminishes while underwater, representing how long he can hold his breath.|$|E

5|$|The Last Story is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game (ARPG) incorporating elements of tactical and stealth gameplay. The player controls main protagonist Zael {{for the majority}} of the game. Zael is primarily controlled using the Wii Remote from a fixed third-person view. The game can be controlled using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, or the Classic Controller. The game's main hub is a public house on Lazulis Island, which also houses a save point for players. Lazulis City is the main setting for most of the game, which provides the player with story-related and side quests. In addition to environments within missions such as ruins and forests where enemies are encountered and fought, there is an arena where the player can improve the party and their combat abilities. If the party is victorious, the party <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> money and items from non-playable characters betting on the fight.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} an automap to help players navigate the {{different areas of}} the game. Additionally, the player <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> maps of certain sections to reveal unexplored areas. To save their progress, players need to find ink ribbons and use them with a typewriter; the game features a limited supply of ink ribbons, so players cannot save their progress as many times as they want. The story of the game is slightly altered by the character the player chooses to play as, and certain choices the player makes in the game can impact the direction of the game and its ending. Upon completing the game under a certain difficulty setting and time limit, the player may unlock secret costumes for the main characters, bonus weapons, and special difficulty modes.|$|E
5|$|The game {{starts with}} a {{character}} creation screen where the player can choose items for their playable character, such as their physical appearance, race and creed. The player can choose to play {{as one of the}} eleven available classes: fighter, barbarian, paladin, ranger, wizard, druid, monk, priest, rogue, chanter and cipher. Each of them make the gameplay different; for example, the cipher can use the soul of an enemy in order to attack them, and druids can shapeshift into a beast and cast spells. The protagonist's class can also influence the number of available dialogue options. The player may adventure with up to five other characters {{out of a total of}} eight that they <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> on their travels. These are fleshed out characters with unique personalities and appearances. Additionally, the protagonist can hire party members which the player creates in local taverns, but at a monetary cost.|$|E

5|$|As {{a change}} from earlier games by the developer, Sabreman is invulnerable to enemies and is instead knocked back in a bounce by their touch. However, Sabreman will fall to his death if knocked off a precipice. The player begins with six lives and few extras can be found {{throughout}} the game. Blue gemstone power-ups turn Sabreman invincible to enemy touch for {{a limited amount of}} time. Enemies include harpies and gargoyles, who can be killed with Sabreman's weapon. Later in the game, eagles <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> and drop Sabreman. Underwurlde has three possible endings, and each was designed to correspond to the plots of the three planned sequels in the Sabreman series. The player receives a score calculated by the number of objects acquired, enemies defeated, and percentage of rooms visited. The game also supports keyboard and joystick control, and as with other games from the developer, the instructions packaged with Underwurlde were cryptic, and left the player to figure out the controls and sequence on their own. The Commodore 64 version of the game is similar to the original in appearance and gameplay.|$|E
25|$|ODPâ€™s goal is {{to allow}} implementers of the API great {{flexibility}} to exploit and optimize the implementation. This is intended to enable easy platform portability such that an application written to the API <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> performance gains without needing significant platform knowledge when ported.|$|E
25|$|A full ocular exam {{should be}} {{performed}} for every case of eye pain. Fluoroscein staining is usually diagnostic for corneal ulcers, although staining with Rose Bengal is also recommended as it <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> early viral/fungal lesions, which will appear as multifocal disturbances to the tear film.|$|E
50|$|The game {{features}} a saved game instead of passwords, so players <b>can</b> simply <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> where they left off.|$|R
50|$|Within the match, several boxes {{containing}} various power-ups {{and weapons}} <b>can</b> be <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by the players for advantage.|$|R

25|$|A {{gravitational}} slingshot {{can carry}} a space probe onward to other destinations without the expense of reaction mass. By harnessing the gravitational energy of other celestial objects, the spacecraft <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> kinetic energy. However, even more energy {{can be obtained from}} the gravity assist if rockets are used.|$|E
25|$|Research in 2003 by Professor Margaret Livingstone of Harvard University {{said that}} Mona Lisa's smile disappears when looked with direct vision, known as foveal. Because {{of the way}} the human eye {{processes}} visual information, it is less suited to pick up shadows directly; however, peripheral vision <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> shadows well.|$|E
25|$|Taxis are {{available}} at all terminals, and are licensed by the City of Mississauga. Taxis that are licensed in Toronto can drop passengers off at Toronto Pearson, but only airport-licensed taxis and limos <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> passengers at Toronto Pearson legally. Rides can also be prearranged, allowing for curbside pick up at either terminal. Pearson Airport Limousine companies use GTAA authorized out-of-town flat rates for pick-ups from Pearson Airport.|$|E
