5000|$|The {{time from}} one upper {{culmination}} {{to the next}} is approximately 24 hours, and between an upper to a lower culmination is approximately 12 hours. The movement of the Earth on its orbit and proper motion of the celestial body affect the time between successive upper <b>culminations.</b> Because <b>of</b> the proper and improper motions of the sun, one solar day (the time between two upper <b>culminations</b> <b>of</b> the sun) is longer than one sidereal day (the time between two like <b>culminations</b> <b>of</b> any fixed star). The mean difference is 1/365.24219 because the Earth needs 365.24219 days for its orbit around the Sun. (see also sidereal day) ...|$|R
50|$|Preservation Hall {{celebrated its}} Golden Anniversary from 2011 to 2012. In {{honor of the}} past, present, and future, Preservation Hall {{produced}} several projects celebrating 50 years. The <b>culminations</b> <b>of</b> projects led to a sold out performance at Carnegie Hall.|$|R
5000|$|The Superdome was {{renowned for}} hosting many of Mid-South Wrestling's large, [...] "Blow Off" [...] events that were <b>culminations</b> <b>of</b> {{weeks or months}} of feuds and rivalries.

5|$|A {{more recent}} theory, with broad support among archaeologists, is that Celtic culture and {{language}} arrived in Ireland {{as a result}} of cultural diffusion. This theory proposes that the Celticisation of Ireland may have been the <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> a long process of social and economic interaction between Ireland, Britain and adjacent parts of Continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> the policy, no {{geographical}} or topographical {{names of}} non-Turkish origin remained. Some {{of the newer}} names resembled their native names, but with revised Turkish connotations (i.e. Aghtamar was changed to Akdamar).|$|E
50|$|Isla Margarita eastern {{is formed}} by a {{mountain}} range which runs roughly north-south direction, from northern Porlamar to Cabo Negro; north {{from the town}} of El Espinal the massif rises steeply to the <b>culminations</b> <b>of</b> San Juan and Copey hill, showing heights of 960 and 890 m respectively. The hills are Matasite and Guayamurí Los Andes foothills. To the north stands the Tragaplata hill.|$|R
50|$|One <b>of</b> the <b>culminations</b> <b>of</b> {{the plot}} is the {{decision}} by the people of Islandia to reject the demands of the Great Powers for unrestricted trade and immigration, choosing instead to maintain their tradition of isolation.

50|$|The {{most recent}} <b>culminations</b> <b>of</b> LGBT rights in New York include {{the passage of}} the Marriage Equality Act in June 2011, {{granting}} the legalization of same-sex marriage to New York residents, and the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in the New York-originated landmark case United States v. Windsor to strike down key federal prohibitions against the recognition of lawful same-sex marriages throughout the United States.|$|R
5|$|Schubert's last sonatas are {{sometimes}} compared to Mozart's last symphonies, as unique compositional achievements: both consist of trilogies with one tragic, minor-key work, and two major-key works; both were created during an astoundingly {{short period of}} time; and both creating a <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> the composer's lifetime achievement in their respective genres.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Khafji was {{the first}} major ground {{engagement}} of the Gulf War.

5|$|The {{arrest and}} {{assassination}} of Ngô Đình Diệm, {{the president of}} South Vietnam, marked the <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> a successful CIA-backed coup d'état led by General Dương Văn Minh in November 1963. On 2 November 1963, Diệm and his adviser, his younger brother Ngô Đình Nhu, were arrested after the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) had been successful in a bloody overnight siege on Gia Long Palace in Saigon. The coup was the <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> nine years of autocratic and nepotistic family rule in South Vietnam. Discontent with the Diệm regime had been simmering below the surface, and exploded with mass Buddhist protests against long-standing religious discrimination after the government shooting of protesters who defied {{a ban on the}} flying of the Buddhist flag.|$|E

Łobozew Dolny has an asphalt road connection which weaves around the mountain up to 700 metres, and steadily declines down to the complex.|$|R
50|$|As of June 28, 2006, 150 mi of {{continuous}} four-lane divided highway is open between Starkville, Mississippi, and Jackson, Mississippi. The last leg to open was the 11.9 mi, $27-million section from {{the intersection of}} Highway 19 north of Louisville, Mississippi, to Noxapater Creek in Winston County. This is one <b>of</b> the <b>culminations</b> <b>of</b> the 1987 Four-Lane Highway Program (commonly referred to as AHEAD Program) for improving Mississippi roadways.|$|R
50|$|After the <b>culminations</b> <b>of</b> Franco-German enmity in both world wars, the two {{actively}} gave {{up their}} mutual animosities {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century. The most prominent symbol of this development is the picture of heads of government François Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl holding each other's hands at a ceremony at the military cemetery in Verdun in 1984. Today, Germany and France are close political partners and two closely connected nations. A joint Franco-German television network, Arte, was founded in 1992.|$|R

5|$|A 22milligram {{batch of}} berkelium-249 was {{prepared}} in a 250-day irradiation and then purified for 90 days at Oak Ridge in 2009. This target yielded the first 6 atoms of tennessine at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), Dubna, Russia, after bombarding it with calcium ions in the U400 cyclotron for 150 days. This synthesis was a <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> the Russia—US collaboration between JINR and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on {{the synthesis of}} elements 113 to 118 which was initiated in 1989.|$|E

500|$|The {{passing of}} the Tokoi Senate bill, called the [...] "Power Act", in July 1917 became the first one <b>of</b> the three <b>culminations</b> <b>of</b> the power {{struggle}} between the Social Democrats and the conservatives during the political crisis from March 1917 {{to the end of}} January 1918. The fall of the Russian emperor opened the question of who would hold the highest political power in the former Grand Duchy. Although the Finns had accepted the liberating manifesto of March 1917 issued by the Russian Provisional Government, they planned an expansion of the autonomy.|$|R
5000|$|Whitwell’s {{reputation}} as an architect has not withstood the test of time, and his texts have either been lost or {{had little or no}} influence, but his design for New Harmony has been revisited as one <b>of</b> the <b>culminations</b> <b>of</b> early 19th-century Utopian experimentation in the United States. The proliferation of new communities with emphasis on either religious or secular collective living reached its high point as Whitwell was producing his design for New Harmony. However, none displayed such a graphic interpretation of their own philosophy as Whitwell’s famous perspective did.|$|R
5|$|Although {{contemporary}} historians vilified Domitian {{after his}} death, his administration provided {{the foundation for}} the peaceful empire of the 2nd century CE, and the <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> the 'Pax Romana'. His successors Nerva and Trajan were less restrictive, but in reality their policies differed little from Domitian's. Much more than a gloomy coda to the 1st century, the Roman Empire prospered between 81 and 96, in a reign which Theodor Mommsen described as the sombre but intelligent despotism of Domitian.|$|E
5|$|Chris Simmons played DC Mickey Webb from 2000 to 2010. He {{appeared}} {{twice on}} the show playing different roles, most notably as a criminal in 1999, before joining the cast as a regular in the following year. He left the series temporarily in 2003, as the <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> a storyline where his character was raped. He made several guest appearances before returning as a regular in 2005.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} years of his career, {{dedicated}} almost exclusively to the Sagrada Família, Gaudí reached the <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> this naturalistic style, creating a synthesis of all of the solutions and styles he had tried until then. Gaudí achieved perfect harmony between structural and ornamental elements, between plastic and aesthetic, between function and form, between container and content, achieving the integration of all arts in one structured, logical work.|$|E

5000|$|Determinism is a {{philosophical}} concept often confused with fate, {{it can be}} defined as the notion that all intents/actions are causally determined by the <b>culminations</b> <b>of</b> an agent’s existing circumstances; simply put, everything that happens is determined by things that have already happened. Determinism differs from fate in that it is never conceived as being a spiritual, religious, nor astrological notion; fate is typically thought of as being [...] "given" [...] or [...] "decreed" [...] while determinism is [...] "caused." [...] Influential philosophers like Robert Kane (philosopher), Thomas Nagel, Roderick Chisholm, and A.J. Ayer have written about this notion.|$|R
50|$|Kampmann was {{initially}} {{one of the}} leading Danish proponents of the national romantic style. However, during the 1920s he adopted the Nordic Classicism style, becoming one of its main initiators. His most famous work is one <b>of</b> the <b>culminations</b> <b>of</b> the style, the Police Headquarters in Copenhagen (1918-22) (in a team with Aage Rafn, Holger Jacobsen and F. Fredriksen) he was among the initiators of 1920s Nordic Classicism. This last building was completed after his death in summer 1920 by his two sons, Christian and Hans Jørgen Kampmann, together with Rafn. Kampmann also was responsible for a number of building restoration projects, notably Aarhus Cathedral (1907-20).|$|R
5|$|From June 1951 to May 1953, Hayward {{was head}} of the Military Applications Division of the Atomic Energy Commission, where he {{conducted}} atomic weapons laboratory work at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He also worked on the foundation of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory program in 1952 in close collaboration with Edward Teller. The <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> this was working on the Ivy Mike nuclear test.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Ray made {{a sequel}} to Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne, a {{somewhat}} political Hirak Rajar Deshe (Kingdom of Diamonds). The kingdom of the evil Diamond King, or Hirok Raj, is an allusion to India during Indira Gandhi's emergency period. Along with his acclaimed short film Pikoo (Pikoo's Diary) and hour-long Hindi film, Sadgati, this was the <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> his work in this period.|$|E
5|$|In December 1888 {{he painted}} La Berceuse – {{a figure that}} he thought {{as good as his}} sunflowers. It has a limited palette, varied brushstrokes and simple contours. It appears to be a <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> portraits of the Roulin family {{completed}} in Arles between November and December. The portraits show a shift in style from the fluid, restrained brushstrokes and even surface of Portrait of the Postman to the frenetic style, rough surface, broad brushstrokes and use of a palette knife in Madame Roulin with Baby.|$|E
40|$|A 16 -year old {{boy named}} Ayumu is in a dream. This dream, {{formed by the}} <b>culminations</b> <b>of</b> the regrets he had harbored in his life, has become {{something}} called a Dreamshot Dissonance. He will meet people close to him in this dream, including his classmate, his best friend, and his little sister. Ayumu must face the manifestations of his own regrets and eventually conquer his dark, inner self. Will he triumph over the seven sins of humanity, and topple his pride? Or will he wake up, never to overcome this Dreamshot Dissonance? This game is technically a top-down shoot �em up, but is more {{commonly referred to as}} a Bullet Hell or Danmaku game...|$|R
40|$|Heinrich {{layers of}} the glacial North Atlantic record abrupt {{widespread}} iceberg rafting of detrital carbonate and other lithic material at the extreme-cold <b>culminations</b> <b>of</b> Bond climate cycles. Both internal (glaciologic) and external (climate) forcings have been proposed. Here we suggest {{an explanation for the}} iceberg release that encompasses external climate forcing {{on the basis of a}} new glaciological process recently witnessed along the Antarctic Peninsula: rapid disintegrations of fringing ice shelves induced by climate-controlled meltwater infilling of surface crevasses. We postulate that peripheral ice shelves, formed along the eastern Canadian seaboard during extreme cold conditions, would be vulnerable to sudden climate-driven disintegration during any climate amelioration. Ice shelf disintegration then would be the source of Heinrich event icebergs...|$|R
50|$|It {{is usually}} {{advisable}} {{to study the}} underlying theme behind the Yogas rather than attempt to memorize them. Rāja Yogas are givers of fame, status and authority and are formed typically by the association of the Lord of Keṅdras/ quadrants, when reckoned from the Lagna/ ascendant, and the Lords of the Tṛkoṇa/ trines. The Rāja Yogas are <b>culminations</b> <b>of</b> the blessings of Viṣṇu and Lakṣmī. Some planets, such as Mars for Leo Lagna, do not need another Graha to create Rājayoga, but are capable of giving Rājayoga suo-moto due to their own lordship of the 4th Bhāva and the 9th Bhāva from the Lagna, the two being a Keṅdra and Tṛkoṇa Bhāva respectively.|$|R
