5|$|Tropical Storm Etau {{originated}} on August5 {{out of an}} area of {{low pressure}} associated with disorganized convective activity located about 550km (280mi) east-northeast of Guam. The following day, the system relocated several dozen kilometers to the north. Convective turning began to appear on satellite imagery and a Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough (TUTT) cell to the north provided a northward <b>component</b> <b>to</b> the system's movement. Early on August7, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the developing system as deep convection consolidated around the low pressure system. Around 0000UTC on August8, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated the system as a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|A high {{pressure}} system over the central United States drifted east {{and added a}} westward <b>component</b> <b>to</b> Gordon's southward motion, pulling the storm southwest towards Florida. The persistent shear and a continued lack of deep convection eventually reduced the storm's winds to below tropical storm force, and on the morning on November 20 Gordon became a tropical depression. The {{high pressure}} system over the continent continued pulling the depression towards the west until it made its final landfall near Cape Canaveral that night with winds of 30 mph (45 km/h). Between its three Floridian landfalls, Hurricane Gordon dumped 5–10 in (13–25 cm) of rain on Florida, with a station at Cooperstown recording 16.1 in (40.9 cm). The storm moved northward across Florida, northeastward across Georgia, and finally merged with a frontal system over South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|After making {{landfall}} near Jacmel, Hurricane Gustav began traversing northwestward {{across the}} mountainous terrain of southwestern Haiti, dumping heavy rains as it passed. With favorable atmospheric conditions the storm maintained its hurricane intensity {{for several hours}} after landfall, but the high mountains over which it was traveling disrupted its lower level circulation. The eye because ragged and clouded over as Gustav weakened to a tropical storm. A large mid- to upper-level anticyclone over the Florida Straight slowed Gustav's movement, holding it over the northern coast of Haiti's southern peninsula. Rainfall from the storm, which had been heavy since its landfall, began to accumulate as the storm's movement stalled. Although the storm's upper levels began experiencing moderate shear, and although parts of its circulation were still interacting with the mountains of southwestern Haiti, enough of Gustav's convection was over the Gulf of Gonâve that {{on the morning of}} August 27 its organization started to improve. That afternoon, as a broad ridge extended from the Gulf of Mexico into the western Atlantic Ocean, Tropical Storm Gustav began to slowly pull to the west, away from the island of Hispaniola. Increased shear weakened the storm as the building ridge to the north of Gustav imparted a southerly <b>component</b> <b>to</b> the storm's motion.|$|E

Three Joker gang members fight three Bane gang members, {{and in turn}} the team of Batman and Robin. Gangs win by killing all the opposing team's reinforcements, while Batman and Robin win by acquiring intimidation points (from eliminating gang members). A gang member can become boss (Joker or Bane), gaining more-powerful abilities. Gang members can access guns and explosives; Batman and Robin can access gadgets and abilities from the main game, including Detective Vision. Gang members have a limited Enhanced Vision, which requires recharging. Hunter, Hunted sets three Joker thugs and three Bane thugs against Batman in a last-team-standing match in which each character has one life.|$|E
5|$|Crossing {{over the}} central Philippines and the Sibuyan Sea, Tropical Storm Dot grew {{in size and}} intensity. By June7, the storm entered the South China Sea and {{acquired}} a brief northerly <b>component</b> <b>to</b> its track. At the time, forecasters at the JTWC anticipated that Dot would interact with an approaching weather front and track north of Hainan Island. The front failed to materialize, however, and the storm resumed a west-northwesterly track. Owing to low wind shear and warm waters, Dot attained typhoon status on June8. Following {{the development of an}} eye, the storm reached its peak intensity later that day as a Category3 equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, with maximum sustained winds estimated at 185km/h (115mph). By the morning of June9, the JMA assessed Dot to have attained ten-minute sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph) and a barometric pressure of 955mbar (hPa; 28.2inHg).|$|E
5|$|Immediately after forming, {{the storm}} moved northwestward around the {{periphery}} of a ridge of high pressure in the central Atlantic. As Fay moved away from its parent upper low, wind shear once again increased. The National Hurricane Center originally expected the cyclone to remain weak, but Fay began organizing more quickly than anticipated. Relatively strong winds sampled by a Hurricane Hunters aircraft necessitated a special off-hour advisory to raise the cyclone's intensity estimate. The storm started to acquire characteristics of a fully tropical system, and despite strong southerly wind shear preventing thunderstorms from developing near the center, Fay's wind speeds steadily increased. Upper-level air divergence from the nearby non-tropical low {{may have contributed to}} the storm's resilience. After convection became more symmetrical and the wind field contracted, Fay transitioned into a tropical storm at 06:00UTC on October11. At the same time, the system turned toward the north around the central Atlantic ridge, soon gaining an easterly <b>component</b> <b>to</b> its movement. Fay remained heavily sheared, with the deepest convection still displaced from the center.|$|E

During the 2008–09 season, Kesler began adding a more offensive <b>component</b> <b>to</b> his game and was moved up to the Canucks' second line from third.

His proposal was to spend $900billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main <b>component</b> <b>to</b> lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage.

5|$|Once {{classified}} a super typhoon, Gordon {{acquired a}} slight northerly <b>component</b> <b>to</b> its track and maintained a general west-northwestward trajectory {{for the remainder}} of its existence. Late on July15, Gordon made landfall in northern Luzon, Philippines, at peak intensity. Remaining over land for several hours, the storm quickly weakened before entering the South China Sea. The system maintained minimal typhoon status as it developed a large, ragged eye by July17. Slight weakening took place hours before Gordon made landfall as a strong tropical storm near Zhanjiang in Southern China on July18. Briefly moving over the warm, shallow waters of the Gulf of Tonkin, Gordon's convective structure tripled in size; however, the system continued to weaken. Later that day, the storm made its final landfall in southern Guangxi Province. Once onshore, Gordon quickly weakened and was last noted on July19 by the JMA over southern Guangxi.|$|E
