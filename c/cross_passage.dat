25|$|The {{plan of the}} {{building}} was originally a simple rectangle. From north-west to south-east, the ground-floor consisted of a parlour with fireplace, an adjoining hall with a large open hearth, a <b>cross</b> <b>passage,</b> and finally a room which probably served as John Shakespeare's workshop. This arrangement was mirrored on the first-floor by three chambers accessed by a staircase from the hall, probably where the present stairs are sited. Traditionally, the chamber over the parlour is the birthroom. A separate single-bay house, now known as Joan Hart's Cottage, was later built onto the north-west end of the house, and the present kitchen was added at the rear with a chamber above it.|$|E

[...] The length of a complete set is dictated by safety regulations in the Channel Tunnel; as the distance between consecutive cross passages is 375 m, this ensures that were a Eurostar train {{to have to stop}} in the Tunnel, it would always be next to a <b>cross</b> <b>passage.</b>|$|E
60|$|On {{this side}} of the house there was a <b>cross</b> <b>passage,</b> {{dividing}} the front rooms from the back. At the end of this, looking to the front so as to have the parlour between it and the house-door, was the chamber in which slept Brattle and his wife. Here all those children had been born who had brought upon the household so many joys and so much sorrow. And behind, looking to the back on to the little plot of vegetables which was called the garden,--a plot in which it seemed that cabbages and gooseberry bushes were made to alternate,--there was a large store-room, and the chamber in which Fanny slept,--now alone, but which she had once shared with four sisters. Carry was the last one that had left her; and now Fanny hardly dared to name the word sister above her breath. She could speak, indeed, of Sister Jay, the wife of the prosperous ironmonger at Warminster; but of sisters by their Christian names no mention was ever made.|$|E
50|$|The {{circular}} <b>cross</b> <b>passages,</b> {{each with}} an inner radius of 2.0 m, were built using the New Austrian Tunnelling method {{from the eastern}} to the western tunnel in each case. The material was then broken, depending on the ground conditions, with excavators, shovels, rotary hammers and milling. The <b>cross</b> <b>passages</b> were finished during the construction phase as escape routes. The <b>cross</b> <b>passages</b> were built by a dedicated construction team.|$|R

6000|$|And so he drew {{off his own}} yellow boots, and {{put them}} on her feet, which was easy enough, as they were a little too big for her. He had hardly done this, and dressed himself, when he heard some one approaching; and hastily {{removing}} the fallen stool, he got behind the door just as a fat old fellow entered with a broadsword in one hand, and a pitcher of hot water and some towels in the other. Glancing at the bed, and seeing the yellow boots sticking out, the old fellow muttered: [...] "Gone to bed with his clothes on, eh? Well, I'll let him sleep!" [...] And so, putting down the pitcher and the towels, he walked out again. But not alone, for the Prince silently stepped after him, and by keeping close behind him, followed without being heard,--his politeness having been the fortunate cause of his being in his stocking-feet. For some distance they walked together thus, the Prince intending to slip off at the first <b>cross</b> <b>passage</b> he came to. It was quite dusky in the long hall way, there being no windows; and when the guard, at a certain place, made a very wide step, taking hold of a rod {{by the side of the}} wall as he did so, the Prince, not perceiving this, walked straight on, and popped right down an open trap-door.|$|E

5000|$|The vast {{majority}} of those hall houses which have survived have changed significantly over the centuries. In almost all cases the open hearth of the hall house was abandoned during the early modern period and a chimney built which reached from the new hearth to above the roof. This {{was created in the}} vicinity of the <b>cross</b> <b>passage,</b> and sometimes this added chimney actually blocked the <b>cross</b> <b>passage.</b> Once the clearance within the hall was no longer needed for smoke from the central hearth, the hall itself would often be divided, with a floor being inserted which connected all the upper rooms.|$|E
40|$|When {{a project}} {{includes}} two parallel tunnels, <b>cross</b> <b>passages</b> linking both tunnels are normally constructed for safety reasons during tunnel exercise. Design {{and construction of}} the <b>cross</b> <b>passages</b> is a challenging issue in tunnelling design. Excavating <b>cross</b> <b>passages</b> through rock, soft ground, and mixed face conditions presents very different challenges as well as handling groundwater creates additional difficulties.

5000|$|The {{original}} plan usually had four bays {{with the two}} central ones forming the main hall open to the roof with the hearth {{in the middle and}} two doors to the outside at one end forming a <b>cross</b> <b>passage.</b> The open hearth was later moved towards the <b>cross</b> <b>passage</b> and became a fireplace with chimney, sometimes the chimney pile even blocking the <b>cross</b> <b>passage,</b> which had soon been screened off the main hall. Beyond the <b>cross</b> <b>passage</b> the outer bay at the [...] "screens end" [...] or [...] "lower end" [...] of the hall, usually contained two rooms commonly called buttery and pantry, while the rooms in the bay at the other end, the [...] "upper end", were called parlours. The end bays each had an upper floor containing solars, which did not communicate with each other, as the hall rose to the rafters between them. The upper stories on both ends typically extended beyond the lower outer wall being jettied on at least one side of the building. As the main hall had no upper floor the outer wall ran straight up without jettying, and thus the central bays appeared recessed. The early buildings had thatched roofs and walls of wattle and daub often whitewashed. Later buildings would have a brick infilling between timbers, sometimes leading to a complete replacement of the outer walls of the basement with solid stone walls.|$|E

The chimney stacks are of ashlar masonry with moulded caps. The building has a U-plan with a <b>cross</b> <b>passage</b> hall, and consists of two storeys with attics above. The front has two, four and one bay respectively, with the projecting wings gabled. The large windows have stone mullions and relieving arches. The doorway is {{to the left of}} the central section and has double doors with a moulded stone surround. There is a single storey extension with a flat roof to the left, added in the nineteenth century. The parapet has coping between the gables.|$|E

50|$|Believed to {{have been}} {{constructed}} in the early 14th century as the official residence of the rector at St Oswald's Church, probably {{by two of the}} younger sons of Marmaduke de Thweg. Manorial courts were also held here. Built of limestone rubble walls with sandstone dressings, a <b>cross</b> <b>passage</b> originally separated the full height great hall in the southern side, from service rooms and a first floor chamber in the north. The doorway at the eastern end of the <b>cross</b> <b>passage</b> is interpreted as the main entrance, while the western one led to a garden, both originally had a porch. A doorway in the northern gable wall led to a courtyard with an external kitchen and well. In the south-west corner of the great hall is a doorway that led to another building which survives as part of the modern vicarage. And the southern gable had an ogee quatrefoiled window under the apex to provide light.|$|E
50|$|The {{entrance}} to the house would have opened into the cross-passage, typically (but not exclusively) situated at the low-end of the hall, being either part of the hall or separated from it by a full or partial partition. Due to later work, there are no extant remains indicating {{the location of the}} entrance, <b>cross</b> <b>passage</b> or indeed which of the two rooms had been the hall.|$|E
25|$|The two circumambulatory {{passages}} have vaulted roof. In these inner passages, {{surrounding the}} central cubicle, sculptural ornamentation {{in the form}} of 80 large reliefs carved out of volcanic rocks, representing Buddha’s life from birth to death, are depicted. The two main <b>passages</b> have <b>cross</b> <b>passages</b> also, which provide the link between the porch and the standing images of the Buddha.|$|R
50|$|The {{murder of}} a schoolgirl here in 1975 {{prompted}} the TTC to adopt system-wide safety measures such as the first police patrols on the subway and the installation of emergency telephones and alarms.

5000|$|... ==Details== The tunnel is {{the second}} longest planned with a 6.5 km road tunnel and will be the longest {{underwater}} tunnel in Germany. It is designed as a twin-tube tunnel with two lanes in each tunnel tube with reduced hard shoulder. The tunnel is to be made with a circular cross section, which is made of prefabricated concrete elements with 20 <b>cross</b> <b>passages.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 23 March 2007 {{just before}} 10am, three trucks and four cars {{collided}} in the Burnley Tunnel. The crash resulted in multiple explosions and a subsequent fire. This forced {{the evacuation of}} motorists from the Burnley Tunnel. The Domain Tunnel was closed and any drivers in the Domain Tunnel at the time drove out normally. <b>Cross</b> <b>passage</b> tunnels between the Domain and Burnley Tunnels were used by evacuees to exit from the Burnley Tunnel into the Domain Tunnel.|$|E
50|$|The {{entrance}} building {{consists of}} two elongated, T-shaped crossings, which intersect under the large glass dome of the hall. The main corridor leads to the central hall, while the side halls {{can be reached by}} passages running parallel to the <b>cross</b> <b>passage</b> through the central hall. During the renovation of the business and administrative areas, large parts of the station building were converted into facades and additional areas of glass were inserted into its roofs for daylighting.|$|E
50|$|The {{motif of}} Thomas the saint, {{is a fan}} of three spears with a builder's square. This motif has been {{incorporated}} as a recurrent theme into the lancet windows and into the leaded oval clerestory window above the porch way. Spears and a square from the iron gates each side of the east wall - behind which there is a <b>cross</b> <b>passage.</b> It also appears again on the cast iron rainheads on the exterior of the building.|$|E
5000|$|Connected {{structures}} {{have existed}} in England and Wales for centuries. The architectural historian Ronald Brunskill identified four key types of connected farm structures found in England and Wales. The longhouse is generally two connected buildings which {{result from the}} addition of more and more partitions, thus subdividing the structure, or from the outright {{construction of a new}} building adjacent to the original. Longhouses usually have <b>cross</b> <b>passages,</b> and communication flows freely through the structures. The laithe house confines the family and the farm building under the same roof. However, there are no <b>cross</b> <b>passages</b> and no intercommunication between structures. Typical configurations include farm buildings used for both livestock and grain/hay storage. The bastle house is an arrangement which places the living quarters above the farm building and, usually, the farm animals. This type of connected farm was common as a defensive arrangement; living quarters were located high above for security reasons. In what Brunskill called the [...] "simply connected arrangement" [...] the domestic structure is connected to any type of farm building.|$|R
50|$|Glenn Springs is an {{uninhabited}} {{place in}} the state of Texas, United States, which is of historical importance. The Glenn Springs area was a natural spring providing water for Apache and Kiowa routing the Grand Indian <b>Crossing</b> <b>passage</b> at Boquillas, Texas. The Comanche tribes beseech the fresh water crossing on the Comanche Trail during their equine incursions from and to the Mexican Plateau, Sierra Madre Oriental, and the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt regions of Mexico.|$|R
50|$|The tunnel will {{comprise}} two 10 m bores between 40 and 70 m apart, {{linked by}} <b>cross</b> <b>passages</b> every 500m. Boring is planned {{to start in}} 2014, with excavation completed ready for fitting out from 2021. The tunnel will be designed for passenger trains to run at up to 230 km/h, shortening Wien - Graz journey times by 40 min to 1 h 50 min, {{which is expected to}} attract more customers to rail.|$|R
