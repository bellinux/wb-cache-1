6000|$|Although {{strong and}} active I was rather short, {{even for a}} ten-year-old, and to reach the plow handles I was obliged to lift my hands above my shoulders; and so with the guiding lines crossed over my back and my worn straw hat bobbing just above the <b>cross-brace</b> I must have made a comical figure. At any rate nothing {{like it had been}} seen in the {{neighborhood}} and the people on the road to town looking across the field, laughed and called to me, and neighbor Button said to my father in my hearing, [...] "That chap's too young to run a plow," [...] a judgment which pleased and flattered me greatly.|$|E

5000|$|Motocross bars — motocross and {{off-road}} motorcycles have tubular bars with a <b>cross-brace</b> {{to resist}} torsional twist. Such bars may also found on dual-sport, streetfighter, and supermoto bikes.|$|E
50|$|A {{square frame}} made of solid bars is not rigid but tends to bend at the corners. Bracing {{it with an}} extra {{diagonal}} bar would be heavy. A wire would be much lighter but would stop it collapsing only one way. To hold it rigid, two <b>cross-bracing</b> wires are needed. This method of <b>cross-bracing</b> can be seen clearly on early biplanes, where the wings and interplane struts form a rectangle which is <b>cross-braced</b> by wires.|$|R

5000|$|In {{molecular}} biology the ZZ-type zinc finger domain {{is a type}} of protein domain that was named because of its ability to bind two zinc ions. These domains contain 4-6 Cys residues that participate in zinc binding (plus additional Ser/His residues), including a Cys-X2-Cys motif found in other zinc finger domains. These zinc fingers are thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions.

5000|$|The Taupin had {{rectangular}} plan wings, {{the forward}} one providing 65% {{of the wing}} area, both mounted on the central fuselage longeron. They were wooden two spar structures, fabric covered and braced from below with parallel pairs of forward leaning struts to the lower fuselage longerons, each pair stiffened with a horizontal <b>cross-brace</b> between them and with short upward secondary braces to the wings. The wings were mounted with equal and significant dihedral. Both had full-span flaps which were interconnected and could move differentially as ailerons and together as camber changing flaps, a system first used on the glider and acknowledged {{as the source of}} its [...] "extraordinary controllability".|$|E

Additional phosphorylation sites and one glycosylation site are also predicted. The N terminus or 3' end of the gene contains the conserved RING and Zinc finger domains. The RING finger domain contains a <b>cross-brace</b> motif consisting of 6 Cystines and 1 Histidine.The Zinc finger is formed by 3 Cystines and 1 Histidine Typically, RING finger domains are located near the C terminus or 5' end of the protein rather than the N terminus making RNF113A unique. RING finger proteins also usually have multiple types of domains outside of the Zinc finger family.|$|E
50|$|Scramblers, {{designated}} CL by Honda, {{differed from}} the sport bikes (designated CB) to allow for some off-road riding. The CL77 {{differed from the}} CB77 Super Hawk {{in a number of}} ways. To increase ground clearance, it had upswept exhaust pipes running along the bike's left side. A bigger tube frame with a front downtube gave extra strength and ran through the space where the electric starter was mounted in the CB and CA models. Eliminating the starter gave clearance in the frame, and lightened the total weight of the bike. It had a small-capacity painted fuel tank, fork boots, 19-inch front and rear wheels, coarser-tread tires (called universals), a taller handlebar with <b>cross-brace,</b> and abbreviated fenders. Early models had painted aluminum fenders.|$|E

50|$|The {{fuselage}} proper {{was formed}} by two parallel, uncovered flat girder frames 1.10 m apart, each with two long, light alloy primary members. In flight the upper members, with the wings upon them, were horizontal. At its forward end each girder frame had a vertical <b>cross-brace</b> between {{the upper and lower}} members. The lower one sloped upward aft, where three diagonal struts braced the girders; wire cross-bracing stabilised the girders into a beam. At the rear the empennage was conventional, with a parallel chord tailplane mounted on top of the upper fuselage members, a one piece, straight edged elevator hinged on it. There was a single, central fin which blended into a rhombohedral rudder; its cut-away underside provided for elevator movement.|$|E
5000|$|The town of Gebhard was {{established}} by the Union Pacific Railroad about 1876. [...] The Gebhard Post Office opened on April 8, 1881.

40|$|Pentachlorophenol {{is banned}} in some {{countries}}, {{and its use}} in other countries is receiving increased resistance. Also, the increased emphasis on hardwood utilization requires that more information be obtained {{on the performance of}} preservatives applied to hardwoods. Several fungicides applied as brush treatments were evaluated as alternatives to chlorinated phenols for protection of wood above ground. <b>Cross-brace</b> and L-joint test units, constructed of southern pine, Douglas-fir, maple, or red oak, were treated just before assembly and exposed outdoors from 5 to 12 years at two sites. After 12 years at the Wisconsin site, untreated pine and maple <b>cross-brace</b> units were severely decayed, red oak had only limited decay, and Douglas-fir had no decay. After 12 years at the Mississippi site, untreated pine, maple, and red oak <b>cross-brace</b> units were severely decayed, and Douglas-fir had no decay. The two hardwood species were more difficult to protect from decay than were the softwood species. No treatment completely prevented decay in maple <b>cross-brace</b> units exposed for 9 to 12 years in Mississippi. Most treatments only slightly reduced decay development in red oak <b>cross-brace</b> units exposed in Mississippi; many treatments protected pine <b>cross-brace</b> units. The L-joint units were exposed for only 5 and 6 years at the Mississippi site but were more difficult to protect from decay than were the <b>cross-brace</b> units. Several alternative treatments were as effective or more effective than the chlorinated phenols in preventing decay in both types of test units...|$|E

40|$|Distortion-induced fatigue {{cracking}} in unstiffened web gaps {{is common in}} steel bridges. Previous research by the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) developed methods to predict the peak web gap stress and maximum differential deflection based upon field data and finite element analyses from two skew supported steel bridges with staggered bent-plate and <b>cross-brace</b> diaphragms, respectively. This project aimed to test {{the applicability of the}} proposed methods to a varied spectrum of bridges in the Mn/DOT inventory. An entire bridge model (macro-model) and a model encompassing a portion of the bridge surrounding the diaphragm (micro-model) were calibrated for two instrumented bridges. Dual-level analyses using the macro- and micro-models were performed to account for the uncertainties of boundary conditions. Parameter studies were conducted on the prototypical variations of the bridge models to define the sensitivity of diaphragm stress responses to typical diaphragm and bridge details. Based on these studies, the coefficient in the web gap stress formula was calibrated and a linear prediction of the coefficient was proposed for bridges with different span lengths. Additionally, the prediction of differential deflection was calibrated to include the influence of <b>cross-brace</b> diaphragms, truck loading configurations and additional sidewalk railings. A simple approximation was also proposed for the influence of web gap lateral deflection on web gap stress. Minnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|E
40|$|Steel {{scaffolds}} collapse {{quite often}} {{in many places}} with {{a considerable number of}} reported casualties, but their behaviour has not been studied to the extent of many other permanent structures. This paper investigates the effect of eccentric loads on steel scaffolding systems used in construction sites. The type of scaffold considered here is the door-shaped steel scaffold with an inner reinforced gable sub-frame. The single-side <b>cross-brace</b> scaffolding systems with various eccentric loads are mainly focused on two issues, namely, the unrestrained boundary and the removal of cross-braces at the access location. This study shows that regardless of the lowest layer of <b>cross-brace</b> in a scaffold being removed or not, the critical load of a scaffolding system under an eccentric load is the lowest, whereas that of scaffolding system under a concentric load is the maximum. If the bottom jack base of a scaffolding system in construction sites is strengthened to a fixed end, the critical load of this scaffolding system will be greatly increased. If a scaffolding system is erected more than 8 stories high, the critical load of the scaffolding system with the fixed end base can be increased to 2. 4 times that with the hinged base. However, whether the cross-braces at the lowest story of a scaffolding system are removed or not, the simulated scaffolding test indicates that the critical load of a used scaffolding system under the eccentric load is the lowest and its load reduction also appears significant.

40|$|RING domains {{are found}} in {{a large number of}} {{eukaryotic}} proteins. Most function as E 3 ubiquitin-protein ligases, catalyzing the terminal step in the ubiquitination process. Structurally, these domains have been characterized as binding two zinc ions in a stable <b>cross-brace</b> motif. The tumorigenic human �-herpesvirus Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes a ubiquitinprotein ligase termed K 3, which functions as an immune evasion molecule by ubiquitinating major histocompatibility complex class I. K 3 possesses at its N terminus a domain related to cellular RING domains but with an altered zinc ligand arrangement. This domain was initially characterized as a plant homeodomain, a structure not previously known to function as an E 3. Here, it is conclusively demonstrated that the K 3 N-terminal domai...|$|E
