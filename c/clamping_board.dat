Typically, a single foot pedal is used to control a clutch which <b>clamps</b> the <b>board</b> in the desired position. A heavy counterweight full of lead shot is installed in the steel linkage so that if the pedal is accidentally released, the drafting board will not spring into the upright position and injure the user. Drafting table linkages and clutches have to be maintained {{to ensure that this}} safety mechanism counterbalances the weight of the table surface.|$|R
50|$|While early mass {{production}} of guitars dramatically {{increased the number}} of guitars in circulation, each instrument was still handcrafted by a single or team of luthiers. For luthiers who still choose to handcraft their instruments, methods have changed very little over the past 500 years. As more advanced tooling options become available, however, less of the work in manufacturing a guitar is necessary to complete by hand. Handcrafting guitars is a time and labor-intensive method of production. Some common tools used by luthiers today are a Band saw, Drill Press, Table Saw, Stationary Sander, Jointer, C <b>Clamps,</b> Sanding <b>Board,</b> Column Sander, Power Planer, Dovetail Saw, Scraper blades, Hand Files, Router, and Sand Paper.|$|R

40|$|Itajime gasuri is a Japanese resist technique, {{which today}} is almost extinct but was {{originally}} employed to patterned warp yarns by clamping them between two boards engraved in high relief. When the clamped bundle was then {{immersed in a}} dye-bath, the dye was unable to penetrate into the areas under pressure and the resulting dyed and finally woven cloth produced an ikat like pattern. A process invented by Tomoshicihi Miura in 1837 to copy and increase production of the labor intensive textile dyeing technique ikat was re-discovered by the highly skilled Craftsman and Japanese weaver Norio Koyama, who in 1996 when visited in Japan was the only remaining craftsperson to still employ on a commercial level, the traditional process of itajime gasuri: the utilization of identically carved wooden boards to resist pattern fabrics. As a silk weaver, Norio Koyama, {{became interested in the}} process of itajime gasuri having purchased the last remaining full set of traditional <b>clamping</b> <b>boards.</b> Teaching himself the intricate and precise processes involved with the technique and required to produce lengths of fabric with patterns similar to double 'ikat'. A present of eight old boards to the author enabled the technique to spread to Europe and has enabled further research to be carried out into the processes involved and along side advancements in digital technology provided an opportunity to reinvent the process by employing old or newly digitally machined boards to produce modern versions of such textiles, which when combined with digital technology in the form of image manipulation and digital printing both onto prepared fabric bases and warps prior to weaving has enabled the process to reinvent itself and design qualities achieved with such a technique evolve into a patterning method for the 21 st Century. The excitement occurs when a process invented by Tomoshicihi Miura in 1837 to copy and increase textile production of the resist dyeing technique ikat can be once again employed to create textile designs if new Itajime gasuri boards are created with digital manufacturing techniques and digital scanning along side digital printed will once woven produce an ikat effect: A complete cycle of creativity and innovation being achieved...|$|R

40|$|Throughout Japanese textile history, Kyokechi or itajime shibori {{has been}} known as a resist dyeing process wherein a piece of folded cloth is {{sandwiched}} between wooden <b>boards</b> <b>clamped</b> tightly to protect selective areas of fabric from dye. This paper introduces a lesser known group of itajime textiles called beni ita, beni itajime, Kyo beni [...] fine, lightweight silks patterned by <b>clamp</b> resist using <b>boards</b> carved with pictorial designs of flowers, birds, etc. These silks were used exclusively for under layers [...] shitagi, an underkimono worn by women in the latter Edo Period (1603 - 1867) through the Meiji Period (1868 - 1912) and into early Showa (1926 - 89). Because they were under layers, these textiles have been overlooked and given little documentation or serious study until recently. Kyoto, the Imperial capital from 741 - 1869, was for centuries the center of fine silk dyeing. Certain fabrics were prized, like momi [...] a fine red silk dyed with beni, the precious red fugitive color from safflower petals, {{one of the most}} expensive dyes in history. Kyoto had a monopoly on production of beni itajime silk until the 18 th century. Then beni dyeing began in Takasaki in Gunma Prefecture which had long been a production center for lightweight silk. A recent discovery of an archive from a dyework in Takasaki revealed that in 1845 substitutes for safflower were used: sappan (Caesalpinia sappan L.) and turmeric (Curcuma longa L.). In 1875, newly introduced chemical red dyes were adopted. The manufacturing of red itajime silk began thereafter, capturing the popular market. This illuminating archive contains 74 carved boards and documentation that sheds significant light on the research of Japanese clamp resist dyeing methods...|$|R
60|$|At {{the end of}} this lowest passage was a door {{which opened}} into a single large vaulted room. It was devoid of furniture, but in the centre was a large and heavy wooden <b>board</b> <b>clamped</b> with iron. This lay upon a rude stone parapet, {{engraved}} with inscriptions beyond the wit of the eastern scholars, for this old well dated from a time before the Greeks founded Byzantium, when men of Chaldea and Phoenicia built with huge unmortared blocks, far below the level of the town of Constantine. The door was closed, and the eunuch beckoned to the slaves that they should remove the slab which covered the well of death. The frightened boy screamed and clung to the abbot, who, ashy-pale and trembling, was pleading hard to melt the heart of the ferocious eunuch.|$|R
5000|$|A {{lashing device}} is a rope, wire cable, or strap which wraps around {{the board and}} {{essentially}} ties it up {{with some sort of}} locking device. A simple low cost {{way to do this is}} to wrap chain around the surfboard and secure it with a lock. <b>Board</b> <b>clamping</b> devices are large mechanical pencils that wrap around the board and like the lashing product secure the board by kissing it. Many times these clamping devices can be hard mounted in a truck bed or on the roof of a car to act as a carrying rack. Mechanical attachments to the board hardpoints such as the leash plug and fin box vary widely in their configuration but are generally some sort of attaching mechanism which grabs onto or into the board and then secured with a lock.http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_Lock_A_Surfboard.jpg ...|$|R
40|$|Present-day {{interest}} in the thermal analysis of electronic circuit boards arises {{mainly because of the}} failure of such components as a result of thermal fatigue. A thermal/structural ANSYS model was integrated in this study to enable the predictions of the temperature and stress distribution of vertically <b>clamped</b> parallel circuit <b>boards</b> that include series of symmetrically mounted heated electronic modules (chips). The board was modeled as a thin plate containing heated flush rectangular areas representing the heat generating modules. The ANSYS model was required to incorporate the effects of mixed convection on surfaces, heat generation in the modules, and conduction inside the board. Appropriate convection heat transfer coefficients and boundary conditions resulted in a temperature distribution in the board and chips. Then structural analyses were performed on the same finite element mesh with structural elements capable of handling orthotropic material properties. The stress fields were obtained and compared for the two models possessing different fiber orientations...|$|R
40|$|Printed {{circuit boards}} made of {{composites}} in working environments such as avionics or transportation are susceptible of structural failure or irreversible damage under the vibration of the equipment. Structural modal/harmonic {{finite element models}} in ANSYS are integrated in this study to enable the predictions of resonance frequency shifts and failure stress for vertically <b>clamped</b> parallel circuit <b>boards</b> with inclusion of series of mounted electronic modules (chips). The board is modeled as a thin plate made of layers of E-glass composite with different fiber orientations and inter-fiber angles. Appreciable differences in maximum failure stress and resonance frequency shifts are observed by changing the above parameters in the fabrication of the boards. Mathematical approximations (metamodels) are provided to describe the complex trend of resonance frequencies in terms of angular design parameters. The model equations would simplify the parametric effects on frequency shifts and provide insight into any subsequent design optimization {{in the absence of}} access to FE codes, or readiness to devote more resources on FE analysis. Overall this study presents feasible ANSYS models that render successfully an optimal design for composite circuit boards under vibration loads, and without weight increase by modifications or material additions. This would lead to board designs that are more durable and reliable under noise, shock, and vibration loads...|$|R
40|$|This {{panel of}} textile artists comes {{together}} to discuss current replication studies and design application {{of an ancient}} resist dyeing technique that involves carved <b>board</b> <b>clamped</b> resist dyeing on fabric. The inspiration pushing the panelists comes from 6 - 7 th century jia xie in China and kyokechi in Japan and work from the Calico Museum in India {{as well as the}} important work of contemporary researchers, Tomoko Torimaru and Masanoa Arai. The idea of creating patterns by tightly clamping folded fabric between mirrored carved board pairs is simple. The contemporary artistry is in finessing and manipulating dye penetration, choice of contemporary fabrics and design enhancements such as overdyeing, discharge dyeing and layering pattern on pattern with multiple processes accomplished on the same fabric. Historically, simple two color, high contrast patterning was created quickly with an eye toward mass production. Specialty fabrics were created by using holes and plugs selectively to control color flow of dye specifically to different parts of the clamped fabric. Use of this technique with today’s range of dyes is infinite. The purpose of this panel is to bring this ancient technique and its current application to this textile audience. Successes and failures are shared. Problem solving, an inherent part of any artistic exploration, breaks down the challenges of block characteristics, dye manipulation, dye penetration, clamping and positioning to uncover the mysteries of this ancient technique and reveal its contemporary potential...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{drop test}} results of 2 nd-level {{assemblies}} can {{be influenced by}} numerous impact factors. The explicit definition of drop testing conditions by the JEDEC standard JESD 22 -B 111 was intended to create a highly repeatable, and thus comparable, experimental setup. Recent developments showed, however, shifting failure modes from component to PCB side. Comprehensive drop tests were executed with 3 different memory packages. Failure analysis surprisingly found electrical fails of the assemblies on PCB side with broken copper traces next to the PCB pads. Detailed investigations showed a strong influence of the copper trace routing on their failure probability. Broken copper traces were only found when their routing direction was aligned to the dominating PCB deflection. The new experimental insights were proven by a two steps simulation approach. In the first step, an experimentally calibrated and validated 3 -D JEDEC board model has been set up. In the second step, th e copper trace routing effect was investigated by a 3 -D sub-model of a single BGA component. The direction of copper trace routing showed a clear effect on the plastic copper strain. Simulation results were able to prove the experimental observations. Using these results, reliability modeling was started for two drop test configurations: 4 -screw and 6 -screw <b>board</b> <b>clamping.</b> In both cases, the sequence of failure of the components on the board was matched by using a combined criterion of plastic strain-rate and resultant force integral. The lifetime model based on this criterion was able to predict the experimental cycles-to-failure with less than 25 % deviation...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a report}} on our field studies taken to {{identify}} and observe in China the process of itajime shibori, or carved <b>board</b> <b>clamp</b> resist dyeing known as Jiaxie in Chinese and Kyokechi in Japanese. There is very little known history of this craft as generally not much attention is paid in China to their folk traditions. In 2003 and 2004, we visited Yishan, Cangnan, Zhejiang Province at a workshop which is now officially designated as Zhongnuo Minjian Gongyi Jiaxie Zuofang, or roughly ‘Chinese People’s Art Craft Jiaxie Studio’. As this designation suggests, we observed some interest by the local government to preserve the area’s folk craft traditions. Through documentations and interviews, we gathered some insightful information about the tradition such as that Jiaxie was produced in some quantity in the Jiangnan area and that fabrics were decorated with auspicious motifs and intended for interior home furnishings. Production was virtually wiped out due to the Cultural Revolution (1960 - 1970) compounded by changing lifestyles. One can extrapolate a certain parallel {{in the case of}} Lanyinhua, a type of blue 2 ̆ 6 white folk textile produced in Zenjiang’s neighboring province of Jiangsu. There, wheat paste resist stencil dyeing with indigo was used to create decorative cotton fabric. During the Ming Dynasty (1368 - 1598), cultivation of cotton began in the Yangtse River (Cháng Jiāng) delta which provided fertile ground for decorative processes using resist dyeing with indigo (this may have likely included Jiaxie). Lanyinhua tradition suffered a fate similar to Jiaxie and its production dwindled considerably after the mid 1900 s...|$|R
40|$|In {{automotive}} electronics, complex automotive functionalities {{are managed}} by car's computers such as {{electronic control units}} (ECU). Albeit extremely rare, accidental drop impacts may occur during transportation or mounting ECUs on automobiles, damaging the built-in printed circuit board (PCB) /ball grid array (BGA) package assembly. However, due to larger package dimensions together with heavy components such as capacitors mounted on the board surface, higher acceleration and stress levels can be achieved on ECU electronic components than on hand-held electronic devices during a drop impact. In such cases, the board level drop test methodology defined in the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC) standard needs to be modified in order to match the requirements in automotive applications. The experimental setup {{used in this study}} includes a test <b>board</b> <b>clamped</b> between two aluminum frames with the help of screws, in order to reproduce the real clamping condition s of the PCB in an ECU. Furthermore, the new board design allows mounting additional masses {{at the center of the}} PCB to take into account the effect of the mass of electronic components present in real ECUs. In this work, the mechanical behavior of PCB/BGA assemblies used in automotive applications when subjected to drop events is assessed. Numerical simulations of the board behavior are performed in order to analyze the transient structural response of the PCB and evaluate the local stresses on the board/joint interface responsible for pad cratering. By varying the loading conditions, different stress levels can be achieved on the PCB laminate directly under the solder joints and a stress-life curve for predicting the assembly lifetime is hence established...|$|R
