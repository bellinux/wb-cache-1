25|$|All {{strains of}} S.cerevisiae can grow aerobically on glucose, maltose, and {{trehalose}} {{and fail to}} grow on lactose and <b>cellobiose.</b> However, growth on other sugars is variable. Galactose and fructose are shown to be {{two of the best}} fermenting sugars. The ability of yeasts to use different sugars can differ depending on whether they are grown aerobically or anaerobically. Some strains cannot grow anaerobically on sucrose and trehalose.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} {{has been involved}} in many scientific breakthroughs and inventions. From 1925 until 1948, Sir Norman Haworth was Professor and Director of the Department of Chemistry. He was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Science and acted as Vice-Principal from 1947 until 1948. His research focused predominantly on carbohydrate chemistry in which he confirmed a number of structures of optically active sugars. By 1928, he had deduced and confirmed the structures of maltose, <b>cellobiose,</b> lactose, gentiobiose, melibiose, gentianose, raffinose, as well as the glucoside ring tautomeric structure of aldose sugars. His research helped to define the basic features of the starch, cellulose, glycogen, inulin and xylan molecules. He also contributed towards solving the problems with bacterial polysaccharides. He was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1937.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, Kluyver and van Niel {{coined the}} genus Sporobolomyces and {{classified}} {{it under the}} Basidiomycota. They recognized that the yeast phase produced by Sporobolomyces exhibited the same forcible discharge mechanism as the basidiospores of the Basidiomycota. They therefore hypothesized that the asexual ballistoconidia of Sporobolomyces are homologues with the basidiospores of the Basidiomycota. Their hypothesis however was questioned by many who did not consider the asexual nature of the ballistoconidia as a basidiomycetous trait. Its classification as a basidiomycetous yeast was further demonstrated by Nyland (1949) {{with the discovery of}} its teleomorph; the genus Sporidiobolus. The teleomorph presented basidiomycetous traits such as the presence of dikaryotic hyphae with clamp connections and the formation of resting spores known as teliospores. In the past, Sporidiobolus salmonicolor was thought to be conspecific with Sporidiobolus johnsonii; however it is now well established that they are distinct taxa. Sporidiobolus salmonicolor is distinguished from S.johnsonii by the absence in the former of assimilation of maltose, methyl-a-D-glucoside, <b>cellobiose</b> or salicin.|$|E

Growth {{does not occur}} at [...] This species does not undergo fermentation. Additionally, Sporobolomyces salmonicolor shows positive urease activity and a positive staining response when stained with diazonium blue B. Diazonium blue B is a technique used to classify asexual yeasts {{as members of the}} Zygomycota, Basidiomycota or Ascomycota. The major ubiquinone present is Q-10. The cell wall of S.salmonicolor contains fucose, mannose, glucose and galactose, however xylose is absent. Colonies grow in the presence of glucose, sucrose, maltose, <b>cellobiose,</b> ,-trehalose, melezitose, D-arabinose, ethanol, glycerol, D-mannitol, D-glucitol, D-gluconate, succinate, nitrate and urease. This species does not assimilate myo-inositol or D-glucuronate, and do not form extracellular starch-like compounds.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of oxidoreductases, to be {{specific}} those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cellobiose:acceptor 1-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include <b>cellobiose</b> dehydrogenase, <b>cellobiose</b> oxidoreductase, Phanerochaete chrysosporium <b>cellobiose</b> oxidoreductase, CBOR, <b>cellobiose</b> oxidase, cellobiose:oxygen 1-oxidoreductase, CDH, and cellobiose:(acceptor) 1-oxidoreductase. It employs sometimes one cofactor, FAD, but in most cases both a heme and a FAD located in separate domains. It makes the enzyme to one of the more complex extracellular oxidoreductases. It is produced by wood degrading organisms.|$|E

It {{can be obtained by}} enzymatic or acidic hydrolysis of cellulose and cellulose rich materials such as cotton, jute, or paper.|$|E

5000|$|The {{hydrolysis}} of polysaccharides to soluble sugars {{is called}} [...] "saccharification". Malt made from barley {{is used as}} a source of β-amylase to break down starch into the disaccharide maltose, which can be used by yeast to produce beer. Other amylase enzymes may convert starch to glucose or to oligosaccharides. Cellulose is first hydrolyzed to <b>cellobiose</b> by cellulase and then <b>cellobiose</b> is further hydrolyzed to glucose by beta-glucosidase. Animals such as cows (ruminants) are able to hydrolyze cellulose into <b>cellobiose</b> and then glucose because of symbiotic bacteria that produce cellulases.|$|E
5000|$|CBH1, for example, is {{composed}} of a carbohydrate binding site, a linker region and a catalytic domain. Once the cellulose chain is bound, it is strung through a tunnel-shaped active site where the cellulose is broken down into two-sugar segments called <b>cellobiose.</b> The structure of the enzyme {{can be seen in}} the first figure. The second figure shows the activity of the enzyme, and shows both cellulose binding to the enzyme, as well as the product of this step, <b>cellobiose.</b> Research suggests, however, that the activity of CBH1 is very strong inhibited by the product, <b>cellobiose.</b> Determination of an enzyme that is not as strongly inhibited by the product or finding a way to remove <b>cellobiose</b> from the environment of the enzyme are just more examples of the many challenges that face the use of these enzymes for the creation of biofuels.|$|E

50|$|A. oligospora is {{considered}} a saprobe and is more saprotrophic than other nematode capturing fungi. At first the fungus was considered largely saprophytic in nature but this interpretation was later questionned. Saprophytic growth uses D-xylose, D-mannose, and <b>cellobiose.</b> The fungus uses nitrite, nitrate, and ammonium for its nitrogen sources and uses pectin, cellulose, and chitin for its carbon sources. When predating on nematodes, the fungus uses <b>cellobiose,</b> L-asparagine, L-arginine, DL glutamic acid for its carbon and nitrogen sources.|$|E

50|$|Like {{for other}} members of the Lactobacillus genus, the {{capability}} of this species to survive during food products fermentation was due to some interesting phenotypic characters like the ability to use a wide range of different carbohydrates. The strain LMG 24284 isolated from cocoa fermentation for example is able to ferment <b>cellobiose,</b> galactose, maltose, mannitol, ribose, sucrose, trehalose, D-xylose, while the strain T30PCM01 isolated from fermenting grape marc was able to use mannose, fructose, <b>cellobiose,</b> mannitol, glucose, N-acetyl-glucosamine and L-arabinose.|$|E
50|$|Most thermoglucosidasius strains have hydrolytic {{activity}} to starch, gelatin, and pullulan, {{as well as}} producingacid from adonitol, <b>cellobiose,</b> inositol, and D-xylitol. Colonies are offwhite and mucoid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cellobiose</b> lipids {{are known}} as biosurfactants and natural detergents.

50|$|In {{addition}} to starch synthesis in plants, starch can be synthesized from non-food starch mediated by an enzyme cocktail. In this cell-free biosystem, beta-1,4-glycosidic bond-linked cellulose is partially hydrolyzed to <b>cellobiose.</b> <b>Cellobiose</b> phosphorylase cleaves to glucose 1-phosphate and glucose; the other enzyme—potato alpha-glucan phosphorylase {{can add a}} glucose unit from glucose 1-phosphorylase to the non-reducing ends of starch. In it, phosphate is internally recycled. The other product, glucose, can be assimilated by a yeast. This cell-free bioprocessing does not need any costly chemical and energy input, can be conducted in aqueous solution, and does not have sugar losses.|$|E
