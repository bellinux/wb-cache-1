40|$|A {{finite element}} method is used here to {{simulate}} the temperature field, the thermosolutal convection, the solute segregation, and the non-isothermal phase transformation during the growth of ZnTe crystal via the temperature gradient solution growth technique (TGSG) with an accelerated crucible rotation technique (ACRT). Three different trapezoid-wave ACRT sequences are proposed, and their effects are examined from {{the views of the}} <b>constitutional</b> <b>supercooling</b> and the mixing of the solution. The solution in front of the growth interface can be fully mixed only during the constant rotation stage of the ACRT when there is a clockwise Ekman flow. An inappropriate ACRT can produce excessively strong clockwise and counterclockwise Ekman flows, and this results in <b>constitutional</b> <b>supercooling</b> in front of {{the central part of the}} growth interface at the beginning of the stop stage and in front of the peripheral part at the end of the constant rotation stage. By adjusting the acceleration rate of the ampoule rotation, the appropriate Ekman flows can be obtained to well mix the solution and avoid the <b>constitutional</b> <b>supercooling.</b> An appropriate ACRT sequence is provided, which can facilitate the mixing of the solution, avoid <b>constitutional</b> <b>supercooling,</b> and improve the growth interface morphology...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{mathematical}} model of the unidirectional solidification of a suspension of hard-sphere colloids. Similarity solutions are obtained for the volume fraction and temperature profiles ahead of a planar solidification front. The highly nonlinear functional dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the volume fraction {{gives rise to a}} range of behaviours. For small particles, Brownian diffusion dominates and the system behaviour is reminiscent of binary-alloy solidification. <b>Constitutional</b> <b>supercooling</b> occurs at the interface under certain conditions, leading potentially to an instability {{in the shape of the}} interface. For larger particles, Brownian diffusion is weak and the particles form a porous layer above the interface. In this case <b>constitutional</b> <b>supercooling</b> reaches a maximum near the surface of the layer, and the porous medium itself is potentially unstable.

40|$|Interfacial {{undercooling}} is {{of significant}} importance on microscopic pattern {{formation in the}} solidification of colloidal suspensions. Two kinds of interfacial undercooling {{are supposed to be}} involved in freezing colloidal suspensions, i. e. solute <b>constitutional</b> <b>supercooling</b> (SCS) caused by additives in the solvent and particulate <b>constitutional</b> <b>supercooling</b> (PCS) caused by particles. However, quantitatively identification of the interfacial undercooling of freezing colloidal suspensions is still absent and it is still unknown which undercooling is dominant. The revealing of interfacial undercooling is closely related to the design of ice-templating porous materials. Based on quantitative experimental measurements, we show that the interfacial undercooling mainly comes from SCS caused by the additives in the solvent, while the PCS can be ignored. This finding implies that the PCS theory is not the fundamental physical mechanism for patterning in the solidification of colloidal suspensions. Instead, the patterns in ice-templating method can be controlled effectively by adjusting the additives. Comment: 7 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables, 1 movi...|$|E
40|$|At low {{solidification}} rates, {{the criterion}} for the onset of morphological instability parallels closely the criterion of <b>constitutional</b> <b>supercooling.</b> At somewhat larger rates of solidification, however, {{the results of the}} perturbation theory of morphological instability differ significantly from the predictions of <b>constitutional</b> <b>supercooling.</b> This arises because the critical wave length for instability decreases as solidification rate increases and thus the effects of capillarity (solid-liquid surface tension) play a strong stabilizing role. This gives rise to the concept of absolute stability, according to which the system will always be stable for a sufficiently large rate of solidification. This enhanced stabilization by capillarity is present only so long as local equilibrium is maintained at the solid-liquid interface. If the interfacial temperature drops below its equilibrium value by an amount dependent on growth rate, oscillatory morphological instabilities can occur. The differences among these various stability criteria are illustrated by means of some simple two-dimensional diagrams that should supplant the conventional plots of (temperature gradient) /(growth rate) vs. alloy concentration...|$|E
40|$|Simple {{observations}} of evaporating solutions reveal a complex hierarchy of spatio-temporal instabilities. We analyze one such instability {{suggested by the}} qualitative {{observations of}} Du and Stone and find that it is driven by a novel variant of the classical morphological instability in alloy solidification. In the latter case a moving solid-liquid interface {{is accompanied by a}} solutally enriched boundary layer that is thermodynamically metastable due to <b>constitutional</b> <b>supercooling.</b> Here, we consider the evaporation of an impure film adjacent to a solid composed of the nonvolatile species. In this case, <b>constitutional</b> <b>supercooling</b> within the film is created by evaporation at the solution-vapor interface and this drives the corrugation of the solid [...] solution interface across the thickness of the film.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe U. S. Navy {{has maintained a}} continuous research, development and certification program in HSLA and ULCB steels {{as a replacement for}} the HY steels used in ship construction. The major benefit of the HSLA and ULCB steels stems from the relative ease of weldability as compared with the HY steels which require large amounts of preheating to prevent weld metal crack formation. This study focused on ULCB steel weldment mechanical properties which were shown to be largely dependent on the heat input {{and to a lesser extent}} the base plate composition, cover gas and nonmetallic inclusion composition and content. The heat input rate and subsequent cooling rate for the ULCB/ULCB steel weldments determined the degree of <b>constitutional</b> <b>supercooling</b> indicating a high heat input (large <b>constitutional</b> <b>supercooling)</b> resulted in a tough, finely grained macrostructure while the lower heat input (small <b>constitutional</b> <b>supercooling)</b> generated a weak, columnar/dendritic macrostructure. The utilization of HY- 130 base metal resulted in increased carbon pickup in the fusion zone and consequently poorer mechanical properties. The use of a reactive cover gas markedly increased the inclusion density and promoted the formation of carbides producing the poorest overall mechanical properties. The majority of the nonmetallic inclusions identified were spherical, complex aluminum-silicates or manganese-aluminum-silicates. The presence of inclusions did not appear to be dominant in the nucleation of acicular ferrite or in controlling the microstructural development.

40|$|International audienceSome {{comments}} are offered {{on the paper}} by John J. Gilman (J. Volc. Geoth. Res., 184, 2009, 347 – 350), proposing that large scale <b>constitutional</b> <b>supercooling</b> may explain the formation of basalt columns. This hypothesis was presented twenty years ago (Guy, B. and Le Coze, J., C. R. Acad. Sc. Paris, 311, II, 1990, 943 – 949). However, in contrast to what is postulated by Gilman, I proposed that the chemical variations that may (optionally) show in the prisms do not relate to the major elements (Al, Si, [...] .) but rather to H 2 O and other volatiles. Thermal contraction, which is the more generally accepted hypothesis, also plays a role, particularly in the central “entablature” of the flows. The fingers formed by <b>constitutional</b> <b>supercooling</b> show instead in the colonnades. Original observations are presented that support the hypothesis of supercooling, in particular the existence of circular and radiating structures within the columns, that cannot be explained by meteoric weathering nor by {{the influence of the}} fractures delimiting the prisms.

For the Co/Si 0. 76 Ge 0. 24 samples annealed at an energy density of 0. 2 – 0. 6 J/cm 2, three germanosilicide layers, i. e., amorphous structure and/or nanocrystal, Co(Si 1 −xGex), and Co(Si 1 −xGex) 2, were successively formed along the film-depth direction. At 0. 3 J/cm 2 Ge segregated to the underlying Si 0. 76 Ge 0. 24 film, inducing strain relaxation in the residual Si 0. 76 Ge 0. 24 film. At 0. 8 J/cm 2 the reacted region was mostly transformed to a single layer of Co(Si 1 −xGex) 2, whereas Ge further diffused to the Si substrate. At 1. 0 J/cm 2, <b>constitutional</b> <b>supercooling</b> appeared. Even the Co(Si 0. 76 Ge 0. 24) film used as the starting material for laser annealing could not prevent the occurrence of <b>constitutional</b> <b>supercooling</b> at energy densities> 1. 6 J/cm 2. The energy densities at which Co(Si 1 −xGex) transformation to Co(Si 1 −xGex) 2, Ge segregation to the underlying Si, and <b>constitutional</b> <b>supercooling</b> occurred were higher for the Co(Si 0. 76 Ge 0. 24) / Si 0. 76 Ge 0. 24 system than for the Co/Si 0. 76 Ge 0. 24 system.

40|$|The {{dependence}} of primary arm spacings on growth speed was investigated for cellular and dendritic arrays in Pb- 10 wt percent Sn samples directionally solidified under a constant positive thermal gradient in the melt. The gradient of <b>constitutional</b> <b>supercooling</b> was varied from almost zero (near the break-down of the planar liquid-solid interface at small growth speeds, cellular morphology) to near unity (large growth speeds, dendritic morphology). The spatial arrangements of cells and dendrites, {{as given by}} their coordination number, are not very different from each other. It appears that primary arm spacing maxima and the cell to dendrite transition are strongly influenced by {{the magnitude of the}} solute partition coefficient. The planar to cellular bifurcation is supercritical in Pb-Sn which has a high partition coefficient, as compared to the subcritical behavior reported in Al-Cu and succinonitrile-acetone, both of which have low partition coefficients.

40|$|Cerium-substituted yttrium iron garnet (Ce:YIG) {{exhibits}} the greatly large Faraday Effect, thus it {{has been}} widely studied. With a LHPG method, however, {{it is hard to}} grow pure yttrium iron garnet (YIG) single crystal fibers due to oscillatory instability of the melt and <b>constitutional</b> <b>supercooling</b> effect. From the experimental observation, the addition of CeO 2 into YIG fiber would increase the periodic oscillation of the melt ascribed to Ce-doping, the experimental segregation coefficient less than the unit, would decrease the melting point and the molten zone became wider, which resulted in a decrease of the temperature gradient. An increase of the laser power input could be used to introduce a steeper temperature gradient, and then the Ce-substitution YIG single crystal fibers could be grown at the faster pulling rate. But it was well considered that <b>constitutional</b> <b>supercooling</b> effect and flow oscillation in the melt would also influence the quality of the grown fibers. Moreover, the solubility limit of cerium ions in Ce-substituted Ce:YIG single crystal fiber, which was grew in an ordinary atmosphere, was found to be approximately 0. 3.

40|$|Grain {{refinement}} {{is known}} to be strongly affected by the solute in cast alloys. Addition of some solute can reduce grain size considerably while others have a limited effect. This is usually attributed to the <b>constitutional</b> <b>supercooling</b> which is quantified by the growth restriction factor, Q. However, one factor that has not been considered is whether different solutes have differing effects on the thermodynamic driving force for solidification. This paper reveals that addition of solute reduces the driving force for solidification for a given undercooling, and that for a particular Q value, it is reduced more substantially when adding eutectic-forming solutes than peritectic-forming elements. Therefore, compared with the eutectic-forming solutes, addition of peritectic-forming solutes into Al alloys not only possesses a higher initial nucleation rate resulted from the larger thermodynamic driving force for solidification, but also promotes nucleation within the constitutionally supercooled zone during growth. As subsequent nucleation can occur at smaller constitutional supercoolings for peritectic-forming elements, a smaller grain size is thus produced. The very small <b>constitutional</b> <b>supercooling</b> required to trigger subsequent nucleation in alloys containing Ti is considered as a major contributor to its extraordinary grain refining efficiency in cast Al alloys even without the deliberate addition of inoculants...|$|E
