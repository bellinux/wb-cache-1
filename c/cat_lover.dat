500|$|The Cats of Ulthar was a {{personal}} favorite of Lovecraft's, who was an ardent <b>cat</b> <b>lover.</b> A number of contemporary critics, as well as Lovecraft himself, consider the story {{to be the best}} of all his Dunsanian tales. Other critics have noted that the story is one of Lovecraft's most famous tales that fits both the Dunsanian and the [...] "weird fantasy" [...] style. Literary critic Darrell Schweitzer, however, comments that The Cats of Ulthar resembles Dunsany in [...] "mood and execution" [...] only and that [...] " [...] has no obvious parallels in any Dunsany story". Schweitzer refers to the prose as [...] "restrained", and notes that, unlike Lovecraft, Dunsany preferred dogs and would have been unlikely to have written such an enthusiastic tribute. Lovecraft scholar S. T. Joshi disagrees, claiming that [...] "his tale owes more to Dunsany than many of his other 'Dunsanian' fantasies".|$|E
500|$|Barker's {{theatrical}} success {{enabled him}} to move into radio work. Barker, who had previously been known by his birth name [...] "Ronald", was now {{referred to as the}} less formal form [...] "Ronnie", after a director changed it in the credits, although he did not tell Barker. His first radio appearance was in 1956, playing Lord Russett in Floggit's. He went on to play multiple characters, but primarily the lookout Able Seaman 'Fatso' Johnson and Lieutenant-Commander Stanton, in The Navy Lark, a navy based sitcom on the BBC Light Programme, which ran from 1959 to 1977, with Barker featuring in some 300 episodes. He also featured in the show's radio spin-off The TV Lark as Fatso Johnson, a camera operator, and as a trainee chef in Crowther's Crowd in 1963, and had roles on Variety Playhouse. Barker soon began working in film and television. His first acting job on television was in Melvyn's show I'm Not Bothered. He appeared in various roles in the comedy series The Seven Faces of Jim from 1962, alongside Jimmy Edwards and June Whitfield, as well as parts in Bold as Brass and Foreign Affairs (as Russian embassy worker Grischa Petrovitch). This was followed with dramatic parts in A Tale of Two Cities as Jerry Cruncher in 1965 as well as single episode roles in The Saint and The Avengers, in which he played Cheshire, a <b>cat</b> <b>lover.</b> In 1964 he appeared in Galton & Simpson's gentle comedy, The Bargee, as Ronnie, the illiterate cousin of Harry H Corbett's rascally Hemmel Pike. Other film work at that time included: Doctor in Distress (1963), Father Came Too! (1963) and A Home of Your Own (1965).|$|E
