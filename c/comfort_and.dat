One of Huddle's final productions with PCS was A Christmas Carol, and her final production with the company was Bus Stop.|$|E

5|$|Four {{years after}} the birth of Peter, a {{pregnant}} Margaret returned to England where Michael Hordern, her third son, was born on 3 October 1911 in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. Still stationed abroad, Edward was promoted to the rank of captain for which he received a good salary. The family lived in <b>comfort</b> <b>and</b> Margaret employed a scullery maid, nanny, groundsman, and full-time cook.|$|E
5|$|The DB9 also {{contains}} anti-roll bars and double wishbone suspension, supported by coil springs. To keep the back-end in control under heavy acceleration or braking, the rear suspension has additional anti-squat and anti-lift technology. Later {{versions of the}} car also features three modes for the tuning: normal, for every-day use, sport, for more precise movement {{at the cost of}} ride <b>comfort,</b> <b>and</b> track, which furthers the effects of the sport setting.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Middle Ages, the {{functions}} and composition of households started to change. This was due primarily to two factors. First of all, the introduction of gunpowder to the field of warfare rendered the castle a less effective defence, and did away with the military function of the household. The result was a household more focused on <b>comfort</b> <b>and</b> luxury, and with a significantly larger proportion of women.|$|E

5|$|A wet bell, or open bell, {{is similar}} to a diving stage in concept, but has an air space, open to the water at the bottom in which the divers, or at least their heads, can shelter during ascent and descent. A wet bell {{provides}} more <b>comfort</b> <b>and</b> control than a stage and allows for longer time in the water. Wet bells are used for air and mixed gas, and divers can decompress using oxygen from a mask at 12m.|$|E
5|$|An active {{vibration}} control system, {{known as the}} active control of structural response system, reduces airframe vibration by up to 80% which increases crew <b>comfort</b> <b>and</b> minimises the buildup of stress on the airframe. The cockpit is fitted with armoured seats for the crew, and can withstand an impact velocity of over 10m/s. Dual flight controls are provided, though the AW101 can be flown by a single person. The pilots' instrument displays include six full-colour high-definition screens and an optional mission display; a digital map or forward looking infrared (FLIR) display can also be installed.|$|E

5|$|In 1915, {{the first}} {{proposal}} was launched {{for using a}} bus service {{as an alternative to}} the train. This was rejected because buses were not able to give the <b>comfort</b> <b>and</b> reliability of a train. The idea was proposed again in 1922 by the director of the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. Among the strongest opponents to the bus alternative was Ingolf Elster Christensen, County Governor of Sogn og Fjordane and later parliamentarian, who stated that the Nordre Bergenhus County (today Sogn og Fjordane County Municipality) had paid part of the regional financing of the Bergen Line on condition that they receive a branch line to the Sognefjord.|$|E
5|$|In April 1999, NSB {{launched}} a new branding scheme for their trains. In addition to Puls for local trains and Agenda for regional trains, the Signatur ("Signature") concept was introduced for intercity trains. Signatur would only be used on the Class 73 services, and consist of two classes, <b>Comfort</b> <b>and</b> Comfort Plus. NSB abolished its branding of only having red trains, and introduced a blue and silver livery on the Class 73 trains. The new service had fewer stops and faster travel times. To {{take advantage of the}} faster speeds, the Norwegian National Rail Administration needed to do upgrades to the track, overhead wires and signaling for NOK1.2 billion.|$|E

5|$|On 19 April, a new Jetstream 32 {{aircraft}} {{was taken into}} service. This allowed capacity to increase from 12 to 19 passengers, {{and at the same}} time travel time was reduced from 47 to 39 minutes. By September, the most popular departures were being booked full, and Vildanden asked Coast Air for a larger aircraft, with about 30 seats. In addition to allowing more passengers, larger planes would give higher <b>comfort,</b> <b>and</b> allow a more flexible ticket pricing scheme. An agreement with Danish Air Transport (DAT) to operate an ATR 42, with a capacity of 48 seats, was signed in mid-October.|$|E
5|$|Sadler {{believed}} that mediums were {{a source of}} false <b>comfort</b> <b>and,</b> after World WarI ended, fought against the increased popularity of communication with the dead. In the 1910s and 1920s, attempting to expose purported clairvoyants became one of Sadler's favorite pastimes and he regularly worked with a Northwestern University psychologist and Howard Thurston, then a prominent magician, while investigating psychics. Sadler may have met the magician Harry Houdini (who was also a skeptic) around this time.|$|E

The other venues in contention to host the match were London's Wembley Stadium and Marseille's Stade Vélodrome, but the Camp Nou was considered by UEFA's Stadiums Commission to be the favourite for its superior security, <b>comfort</b> <b>and</b> capacity.|$|E
