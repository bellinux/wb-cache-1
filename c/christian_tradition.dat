5|$|Although the Gospel of John is anonymous, <b>Christian</b> <b>tradition</b> {{historically}} has attributed it to John the Apostle, son of Zebedee {{and one of}} Jesus' Twelve Apostles. The gospel is so closely related in style and content to the three surviving Johannine epistles that commentators treat the four books, along with the Book of Revelation, as a single corpus of Johannine literature, albeit not necessarily written by the same author.|$|E
5|$|On February1,1921, {{nine days}} after Leontovych's death, {{a large number}} of artists, professors, and {{students}} of the Mykola Lysenko Institute of Music and Drama in Kiev gathered to commemorate him, as is expected according to <b>Christian</b> <b>tradition.</b> They established the Committee for the Memory of Mykola Leontovych, which later became the All-Ukrainian Mykola Leontovych Music Society, and promoted Ukrainian music until 1928.|$|E
5|$|The open {{right hand}} of the monk is {{interpreted}} as an oath-making gesture, or a blessing gesture in <b>Christian</b> <b>tradition.</b> The red book in the left hand refers to the oath book of the city (in accordance with the gesture of the right hand), or the municipal law book which is bounded in red and has been handed down since 1365. Another interpretation {{is that it is}} a gospel book.|$|E

5|$|Ancient <b>Christian</b> <b>tradition</b> {{says that}} Christianity reached {{the shores of}} Kerala in AD 52 {{with the arrival of}} Thomas the Apostle, one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ. Saint Thomas Christians include Syro-Malabar Catholic, Syro-Malankara Catholic, Malankara Orthodox Syrian, Jacobite Syrian, Marthoma Syrian, the Syrian Anglicans in the CSI and several Pentecostal and evangelical denominations. The origin of the Latin Catholic Christians in Kerala {{is the result of the}} missionary {{endeavours}} of the Portuguese Padroado in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|It {{is known}} from Byzantine sources that the Rus' caught Constantinople unprepared, while the empire was preoccupied by the ongoing Arab–Byzantine wars {{and unable to}} deal with the Rus' threat. After pillaging the suburbs of the Byzantine capital, the Rus' retreated, {{although}} the nature of this withdrawal, and indeed which side was victorious, is subject to debate. The event gave rise to a later Orthodox <b>Christian</b> <b>tradition,</b> which ascribed the deliverance of Constantinople to a miraculous intervention by the Theotokos.|$|E
5|$|Several states {{claimed to}} be the Roman Empire's successors {{after the fall of the}} Western Roman Empire. The Holy Roman Empire, an attempt to resurrect the Empire in the West, was {{established}} in 800 when Pope LeoIII crowned Frankish King Charlemagne as Roman Emperor on Christmas Day, though the empire and the imperial office did not become formalized for some decades. After the fall of Constantinople, the Russian Tsardom, as inheritor of the Byzantine Empire's Orthodox <b>Christian</b> <b>tradition,</b> counted itself the Third Rome (Constantinople having been the second). These concepts are known as Translatio imperii.|$|E
50|$|Over time, {{the number}} and nature of feasts (and the {{associated}} Titles of Mary) and the venerative practices that accompany them have varied a great deal among diverse <b>Christian</b> <b>traditions.</b> Overall, there are significantly more titles, feasts and venerative Marian practices among Roman Catholics than any other <b>Christians</b> <b>traditions.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the economic}} ethics of three main <b>Christian</b> <b>traditions</b> in Europe: the Roman Catholic tradition, the Evangelical {{tradition and the}} Ecumenical tradition. After defining several common and divergent elements of these different <b>Christian</b> <b>traditions,</b> we analyse the shortcomings {{of the free market}} operation concerning two common Christian values: the priority of the poor and stew-ardship of creation. We conclude that, because of these shortcomings, the <b>Christian</b> <b>traditions</b> will only provide conditional support to the free market.

5|$|Much of Keable's fiction {{contained}} autobiographical elements, often centring on his {{attitudes toward}} {{and experience of}} the Christian religious establishment. As well as these fictional explorations he produced a final, non-fiction work, The Great Galilean, outlining the religious views he developed during a lifetime's uneasy relationship to Anglicanism and Catholicism. He {{came to believe that}} the historical Jesus bore little relationship to the Jesus of <b>Christian</b> <b>tradition,</b> and, in The Great Galilean, attempted to reconcile his ambivalence about the orthodoxies of the Church with his enduring belief in an all-loving God. Keable's views earned him many unfavourable reviews and the contempt of the church in which he had practised, but foreshadowed ideas of free love that became prominent later in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruins of}} three Byzantine-era churches {{are located in}} Bayt Jibrin. A church on a {{northern}} hill of the town, later used as a private residence, had elaborate mosaics depicting the four seasons which were defaced in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. A church south of the town, known as Khirbet Sandahanna, was dedicated to Saint Anne. The New Testament does not give any information about {{the mother of the}} Virgin Mary, but the widely circulated apocryphal Gospel of James gives her name as Anne, and her birthplace as Bethlehem. In another <b>Christian</b> <b>tradition</b> though, Bayt Jibrin is the birthplace of Saint Anne. The initial Byzantine church was rebuilt by Crusaders in the 12th century. Today, the apse with its three arched windows and half-dome ceiling are still intact.|$|E
5|$|Christians {{believed}} in a bodily {{resurrection of the}} dead at the Second Coming of Christ, and the Catholic Church only relaxed its opposition to cremation in 1963. Although mass ossuaries have also been used, burial {{has always been the}} preferred <b>Christian</b> <b>tradition,</b> at least until recent times. Burial was, for as long as there was room, usually in a graveyard adjacent to the church, with a gravestone or horizontal slab, or for the wealthy or important clergy, inside it. Wall tombs in churches strictly include the body itself, often in a sarcophagus, while often the body is buried in a crypt or under the church floor, with a monument on the wall. Persons of importance, especially monarchs, might be buried in a free-standing sarcophagus, perhaps surrounded by an elaborate enclosure using metalwork and sculpture; grandest of all were the shrines of saints, which became the destinations of pilgrimages. The monument to MaximilianI, Holy Roman Emperor in the Hofkirche, Innsbruck took decades to complete, while the tomb of Saint Dominic in Bologna took several centuries to reach its final form.|$|E

5|$|Hope shows {{its central}} {{character}} alone, {{with no other}} human figures visible and without her traditional fellow virtues, Love (also known as Charity) and Faith. She is dressed in classical costume, based on the Elgin Marbles; Nicholas Tromans of Kingston University speculated that her Greek style of clothing was intentionally chosen to evoke the ambivalent nature of hope in Greek mythology over the certainties of <b>Christian</b> <b>tradition.</b> Her pose is based on that of Michelangelo's Night, in an intentionally strained position. She sits on a small, imperfect orange globe with wisps of cloud around its circumference, against an almost blank mottled blue background. The figure is illuminated faintly from behind, as if by starlight, and also directly from the front as if the observer {{is the source of}} light. Watts's use of light and tone avoids the clear definition of shapes, creating a shimmering and dissolving effect more typically associated with pastel work than with oil painting.|$|E
