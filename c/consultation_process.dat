5|$|British Rail {{formally}} {{announced plans}} to close the station on 15 March 1984, pending a statutory <b>consultation</b> <b>process.</b> Closure notices were posted at Marylebone. The proposals proved controversial and faced strong opposition from local authorities and the public, leading to a legal battle which lasted for two years. Despite the pending closure, passenger numbers only dropped by about 400 per day from 1968 levels. The conversion project proved impractical due to the headroom limitations {{on the line and}} the closure was quietly dropped.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Kagame began {{actively}} planning methods to achieve national development. He launched a national <b>consultation</b> <b>process</b> and also sought {{the advice of}} experts from emerging nations including China, Singapore and Thailand. Following these consultations, and shortly after assuming the presidency, Kagame launched an ambitious programme of national development called Vision 2020. The major purposes of the programme were to unite the Rwandan people and to transform Rwanda from a highly impoverished into a middle income country. The programme consists of a list of goals which the government aims to achieve before the year 2020. These include reconstruction, infrastructure and transport improvements, good governance, improving agriculture production, private sector development, and health and education improvements.|$|E
5|$|Whilst airport {{development}} in the UK is subject to local planning authority processes, the government regards airports as {{an important part of}} the national infrastructure and which therefore requires their development to be planned with a strategic approach. To support this, the government began a three-year public <b>consultation</b> <b>process</b> with the publication in December 2000 of The Future of Aviation consultation document. This outlined the issues underpinning air transport and sought views on how they should be addressed in any future policy. One of the main questions asked was whether policy should focus on meeting demand or whether it should focus instead on limiting the negative effects of air transport. Another key issue for which views were sought was how the industry might best meet the environmental costs it incurs. Between July 2002 and February 2003 a further seven regional consultation documents were published. These focussed on the economic, environmental, social and airspace appraisals relating to options for future airport development specific to the regions, and together they generated half a million responses. During the Spring of 2003 workshops based on a consultation document titled Aviation and the Environment - Using Economic Instruments were held to seek stakeholder views on the desirability and effectiveness of various financial measures that might address the environmental impacts of aviation. The <b>consultation</b> <b>process</b> ended in December 2003 with the publication of The Future of Air Transport White Paper which detailed the government's conclusions.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, Shamrock Rovers {{were granted}} {{land in the}} Dublin suburb of Tallaght {{to build a new}} stadium. On 30 March 2000, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern turned the sod at the site. However, work on the stadium ceased in 2001 and in March 2005, South Dublin County Council {{announced}} that they were taking back the land that they had granted to the club, as the conditions of the planning permission had not been met. A public <b>consultation</b> <b>process</b> was initiated in July 2005 and a resolution was passed in December 2005 to alter the stadium to accommodate senior GAA games while still having Shamrock Rovers as the preferred tenants. This decision was subject to additional government funding. This funding was not made available and on 13 January 2006 the council voted to proceed with the original plan.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1953, {{the office}} of the National Herald (Riksheraldiker) was {{responsible}} for preparing municipal arms and the royal arms of Sweden, but today these duties are carried out by the Heraldry Board of the National Archives, including the State Herald (Statsheraldiker). In order to register new municipal arms, a municipality must submit its proposal to both the National Archives Heraldry Board, which consults and renders an opinion, and to the PRV for registration. Once the board has completed its <b>consultation</b> <b>process</b> and provided a warrant of arms, the arms thus warranted may then be registered by the PRV and implemented by the municipality. Apart from municipal arms, heraldic arms registered by counties and by military and other government bodies are also handled by the National Archives Heraldry Board and the PRV.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} different meanings attached to and practices adopted during Swedish local <b>consultation</b> <b>processes</b> on {{offshore wind power}} projects. It analyses {{the role played by}} those processes in a democratic planning context, as well as {{the ways in which they}} are implemented. It also identifies overarching process models. The study is informed by theories on democracy, planning, participation, communication, and media. The empirical material comprises three case studies, each examining experiences of local <b>consultation</b> <b>processes</b> for wind power projects that led to differences in local reception. Methodologically, the study triangulates analyses of semi-structured interviews, documents and news articles. The results show that, in a Swedish context, the role of local <b>consultation</b> <b>processes</b> is to create legitimacy and trust in the process and planning decisions. The complex dynamics become evident in the different forms of participation, knowledge generation, and communication employed during the consultation. This is shown to be the result of various democratic and planning attitudes to locally-situated interests and knowledge, which in turn lead to differing views on local understanding for and acceptance of project proposals. The study develops three schematic models that correspond to different types of <b>consultation</b> <b>processes.</b> An important conclusion is that the content and form of local <b>consultation</b> <b>processes</b> depends on the agency of several actors on different scales. They are not simple pre-designed by project planners, but the result of a far more complex interaction between a host of local actors, including officials, local media, and local communities. The categorisation of different local <b>consultation</b> <b>processes</b> could contribute to awareness about the implications of various ways of working with large-scale projects from local perspectives. I den här avhandlingen undersöks lokala förankringsprocesser med ett särskilt fokus på havsbaserade vindkraftsprojekt. Diskussionen uppehåller sig vid frågor om förankringsprocessens roll i en svensk planeringskontext, samt hur olika utformningar av processen kan påverka det lokala mottagandet. Studien visar att förankringsprocesser ytterst handlar om legitimitet och tillit. I praktiken förekommer en stor variation, komplexitet och dynamik i lokala förankringsprocesser. Det yttrar sig bland annat genom olika former av deltagande, kunskapsbyggande och kommunikation. Centralt i resonemangen är demokratiska och planeringsmässiga förhållningssätt till platsbundna intressen och kunskaper. På så sätt tydliggörs skillnader i synen på förståelse och lokal acceptans avseende ett projektförslag. Genom studien urskiljs också tre schematiska förankringsmodeller som belyser sådana skillnader. Förståelse för lokala förankringsprocesser har betydelse inte minst avseende påverkan på lokal acceptans för storskaliga projekt...|$|R

This chapter seeks to provide some answers by embedding constitution reforms through popular involvement in the broader topic of democratic innovations. We start with a discussion of frameworks for the analysis and explain our decision to suggest a new framework. Then we comparatively evaluate the three case studies on constitutional deliberative procedures (Belgium, Iceland, Ireland) referring to input legitimacy, throughput legitimacy and output legitimacy. Finally, we embed the findings into the debate about the effects of democratic innovations in general...|$|R
40|$|This book {{addresses}} one of {{the greatest}} challenges of post-modern democracy: how to bridge the perceived gap between citizens and democratic institutions. It examines internet-mediated multi-stakeholder processes of international and regional organisations - the European Union and United Nations - which aim to democratise decision-making processes in an attempt to counter criticisms of a 'democratic deficit'. The book evaluates two multi-stakeholder <b>consultation</b> <b>processes</b> where the internet played an important mediating role. It critically evaluates multi-stakeholderism as well as the potentials and constraints of the internet in terms of mediating or facilitating such <b>consultation</b> <b>processes</b> at international and regional levels of governance. It also addresses the perceived impact of civil society organisations on decision-making processes beyond the nation-state and, in turn, the impact of such participatory experiments on civil society itself...|$|R
