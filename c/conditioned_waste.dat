40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{major components}} of the Dounreay Site Restoration Plan, DSRP {{to deal with the}} site's solid intermediate level waste, ILW legacy. Historic solid ILW exists in the Shaft (disposals between 1959 and 1977), the Wet Silo (operated between 1973 and 1998), and in operating engineered drummed storage. Significant further arisings are expected from future operations, post-operations clean out and decommissioning through to the completion of site restoration, expected to be complete by about 2060. The raw waste is in many solid forms and also incorporates sludge, some fissile material and hazardous chemical components. The aim of the Solid ILW Project is to treat and condition all this waste to make it passively safe and in a form which can be stored for a substantial period, and then transported to the planned U. K. national deep repository for ILW disposal. The Solid ILW Project involves the construction of head works for waste retrieval operations at the Shaft and Wet Silo, a Waste Treatment Plant and a <b>Conditioned</b> <b>Waste</b> Store to hold the <b>conditioned</b> <b>waste</b> until the disposal facilities become available. In addition, there are infrastructure activities to enable the new construction: contaminated ground remediation, existing building demolition, underground and overground services diversion, sea cliff stabilization, and groundwater isolation at the Shaft...|$|E

The gross volume of primary and secondary packages amounts to 2, 600 m{sup 3 }. The waste has been kept in decay storage for up to 30 years. The project was started in 1997. Operation of the various processing facilities will take 7 - 8 years. The overall volume of <b>conditioned</b> <b>waste</b> will be {{of the order of}} 800 m{sup 3 }. All <b>conditioned</b> <b>waste</b> will be stored in appropriate storage facilities onsite. At present (November, 2002), a new processing facility has been constructed, the functional tests of the equipment have been performed and the startup phase has been started. Several cells of the Pamela vitrification facility onsite will be adapted for the treatment of high-level and highly a-contaminated waste; low-level a/a waste will be treated in the existing facility for super compaction and conditioning by embedding into cement (CILVA). The bulk of these waste, of which 95 % are solids, the remainder consisting of mainly solidified liquids, have been produced between 1967 and 1988. They originate from various research programs and reactor operation at the Belgian nuclear energy research centre SCK CEN, isotope production, decontamination and dismantling operations...|$|E

40|$|After {{several years}} of development, a commercially {{available}} high-temperature treatment system has been developed and installed that treats heterogeneous low-level radioactive waste. High temperature plasma processing, unique torch design and operating features make it feasible to achieve a volume reduced, permanent, high integrity waste form while eliminating the personnel exposure and costs associated with conventional sorting, characterizing and handling. Plasma technology {{can also be used}} to treat previous <b>conditioned</b> <b>waste</b> packages that no longer meet the current acceptance criteria for final disposal.

40|$|The {{vitrification}} {{of high-level}} waste is the internationally recognized standard {{to minimize the}} impact to the environment resulting from waste disposal {{as well as to}} minimize the volume of <b>conditioned</b> <b>waste</b> to be disposed of. COGEMA has been vitrifying high-level waste industrially for over 20 years and is currently operating three commercial vitrification facilities based on a hot metal crucible technology, with outstanding records of safety, reliability and product quality. To further increase the performance of vitrification facilities, CEA and COGEMA have been developing the cold crucible melter technology {{since the beginning of the}} 1980 s. This type of melter is characterized by a virtually unlimited equipment service life and a great flexibility in dealing with various types of waste and allowing development of high temperature matrices. In complement of and in parallel with the vitrification process, a glass formulation methodology has been developed by the CEA in order to tailor matrices for the wastes to be conditioned while providing the best adaptation to the processing technology. The development of a glass formulation is a trade-off between material properties and qualities, technical feasibility, and disposal safety criteria. It involves non-radioactive and radioactive laboratories in order to achieve a comprehensive matrix qualification. Several glasses and glass ceramics have thus been studied by the CEA to be compliant with industrial needs an...|$|E
40|$|The {{preferred}} {{route to}} {{treatment of the}} vast majority of intermediate level nuclear waste (ILW) within the UK is via encapsulation within a composite cement system. The integrity of these <b>conditioned</b> <b>waste</b> packages must be maintained for hundreds to thousands of years since they will eventually be stored deep below ground in a geological disposal facility (GDF), with this expected to be a permanent route to disposal. A thorough and clear understanding of the hydration, microstructural development, and hence performance, of grouting materials is essential in providing confidence in the suitability of the technology and ensuring that structural integrity is maintained. This project comes at a time of significant uncertainty for the cement industry, as well as the steel industry which has significant ramifications on the availability of blastfurnace slag (BFS, hereafter referred to as slag). Through quantifying the ramifications of changes to supply of either of these materials {{it will be possible to}} determine the resilience of the technique to chemical and physical variations, in an effort to futureproof supply. Within this study, grouts prepared with slag and ordinary Portland cement (OPC), at a ratio of 3 : 1 slag: OPC at a water to binder ratio (w/b) of 0. 35, were analysed at 20 Â°C. The impact of OPC composition, slag composition and slag fineness on rate and degree of hydration were assessed. Microstructural development was followed by a number of techniques in 2 and 3 dimensions, with the engineering performance of samples also quantified via a range of testing protocols. Resilience to potential fire scenarios was also investigated through simulated heat-testing of samples and subsequent analysis. Slag fineness is the most significant factor in controlling rate and degree of its hydration within both young and mature pastes at these high replacement levels. Availability of pore space into which hydrates may grow appears to the limiting factor in continued hydration; significant quantities of CH remain after 1 year of hydration, intermixed with C-S-H in a densely filled microstructure...|$|E
