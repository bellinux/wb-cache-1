6000|$|Of {{an evening}} these castaways had music for their company--a bell of copper that rang marvellously clear across the frosty air, and would bring multitudes of night-birds {{hovering}} and crying over the hut in perplexity at the sweet and hollow sound. And besides the bell, Battle had a cittern, or lute, {{made of a}} gourd, with a Jugga-wood neck like a fiddle. Stretched and pegged this was, with twangling strings made of a <b>climbing</b> <b>root</b> that grows in the denser forests, and bears a flower lovelier than any to be seen on earth beside. With Battle thrumming on this old crowd or lute, Nod danced many a staggering hornpipe and Mulgar-jig. Moreover, Battle had taught himself to pick out a melody or two. So, then, they would dance and sing songs together--"Never, tir'd Sailour," [...] "The Three Cherrie-trees," [...] "Who's seene my Deere with Cheekes so redde?" [...] and many another.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{trace the}} {{evolution}} of <b>root</b> <b>climbing</b> and scrambling in Dissochaeteae and Sonerileae, two closely related groups that comprise the majority of Old World climbing Melastomataceae. The morphological and anatomical adaptations of the different climbers are interpreted {{in the context of}} a phylogeny based on chloroplast (cp) DNA sequences of the ndhF gene, generated for 31 representatives of Dissochaeteae and Sonerileae/Oxysporeae plus nine outgroups. For 20 of these taxa, the ndhF sequences were combined with cpDNA rpl 16 intron sequences to obtain higher statistical support. Parsimony, minimum evolution, and maximum likelihood approaches yield congruent topologies that imply that scrambling growth evolved once in the common ancestor of Dissochaetinae, a group of ∼ 40 species centered around Dissochaeta and its close relatives Macrolenes and Diplectria. <b>Root</b> <b>climbing,</b> on the other hand, likely evolved in the common ancestor of Catanthera, Kendrickia, and Medinilla section Heteroblemma (together 26 species). In Melastomataceae overall, scrambling is restricted to Dissochaetinae, while <b>root</b> <b>climbing</b> has evolved several times. The scramblers are diverse in open disturbed habitats and show adaptations such as sarmentose branches, hook-shaped adventitious roots, and interpetiolar outgrowths that enhance their ability to lean on and clamber over other plants. Root climbers in the Catanthera-Kendrickia-Heteroblemma clade are restricted to humid habitats and show adaptations such as anomalous growth of the secondary xylem (a rare feature in the family), living <b>climbing</b> <b>roots,</b> and pseudoalternate phyllotaxy, which allows optimal arrangement of the normally opposite melastome leaves against the host's trunk...|$|R

50|$|Scindapsus is {{not easily}} {{distinguishable}} from Epipremnum. The main {{difference between the two}} genera is in the number of seeds they produce. Scindapsus species have one ovule in each ovary whereas Epipremnum species have a few. The seeds of Scindapsus are rounded to slightly kidney-shaped. The plants are primarily <b>root</b> <b>climbing</b> vines.|$|R
50|$|The {{climbing}} fetterbush (Pieris phillyreifolia) is a woody shrub-vine which <b>climbs</b> without clinging <b>roots,</b> tendrils, or thorns. It directs its stem into a crevice in {{the bark}} of fibrous barked trees (such as bald cypress) where the stem adopts a flattened profile and grows up the tree underneath the host tree's outer bark. The fetterbush then sends out branches that emerge {{near the top of}} the tree.|$|R

The cold breath of autumn had {{stricken}} its leaves from the vine until its skeleton branches clung, almost bare, to the crumbling bricks.|$|R
50|$|Urera are lianas, shrubs, {{and small}} trees. <b>Climbing</b> species <b>root</b> along the stems and {{can reach the}} crowns of the trees they use for support. Some are spiny. They almost always have urticating hairs, often on bumps in the epidermis. These are stiff, {{stinging}} trichomes with swollen bases. The leaves are variable in shape and venation, and help {{in the identification of}} species. Also useful is the varying appearance and arrangement of cystoliths on the leaf surface. The inflorescence is a divided, branching panicle of flowers. Most species are dioecious, but a few are monoecious. Most species have male flowers with either four or five stamens and tepals. Female flowers generally have four uneven, free to mostly fused tepals. The fruit is an achene covered in orange or red flesh.|$|R

60|$|Presently {{one of the}} lucivees came out, yawned, stretched, raised {{himself against}} a root. In the morning stillness I could hear the cut and rip of his claws on the wood. We call the action {{sharpening}} the claws; {{but it is only}} the occasional exercise of the fine flexor muscles that a cat uses so seldom, yet must use powerfully when the time comes. The second lucivee came out of the shadow a moment later and leaped upon the fallen tree where he could better watch the hillside below. For half an hour or more, while I waited expectantly, both animals moved restlessly about the den, or <b>climbed</b> over the <b>roots</b> and trunk of the fallen tree. They were plainly cross; they made no attempt at play, but kept well away from each other with a wholesome respect for teeth and claws and temper. Breakfast hour was long past, evidently, and they were hungry.|$|R
40|$|The {{hierarchy}} {{is often}} used to infer knowledge from groups of items and relations in varying granularities. Hierarchical clustering algorithms take an input of pairwise data-item similarities and output a hierarchy of the data-items. This paper presents Bidirectional agglomerative hierarchical clustering to create a hierarchy bottom-up, by iteratively merging the closest pair of data-items into one cluster. The result is a rooted AVL tree. The n leafs correspond to input data-items (singleton clusters) needs to n/ 2 or n/ 2 + 1 steps to merge into one cluster, correspond to groupings of items in coarser granularities <b>climbing</b> towards the <b>root.</b> As observed from the time complexity and number of steps need to cluster all data points into one cluster perspective, the performance of the bidirectional agglomerative algorithm using AVL tree is better than the current agglomerative algorithms. The experiment analysis results indicate that the improved algorithm has a higher efficiency than previous methods...|$|R

40|$|Because {{of their}} sessile nature, plants {{are unable to}} change their {{location}} and thus {{they are forced to}} adapt as much as possible to the environment they grow in. Plants evolved the ability to sense many environmental cues, which enables them to perceive the conditions in their surroundings. One class of these stimuli are mechanical forces - from wind sways to contact with obstacles, herbivores or other plants - other mechanical stimuli are e. g. gravity or sound waves. Carnivorous or climbing plants have structures specialised for perception and rapid response to mechanical stimuli. Intriguingly, there is a less spectacular but maybe even more interesting and important response to mechanical perturbation in non-specialized plants. This thesis tries to summarize ubiquity of mechanoperception in plant kingdom and its adaptive importance for the plant life - from activation of traps, to morphological adaptation for growth at windy sites, tendril coiling in <b>climbing</b> plants and <b>root</b> navigation through obstacles in soil. In the following part, the thesis summarizes the recent knowledge of molecular processes accompanied with mechanoreception, signal transduction and integration, and response to mechanostimulation. In the last part I proppose a scheme of mechanosensing workflow from initial mechanical [...] ...|$|R
30|$|A key for {{the seven}} species is provided, based on the {{internal}} stem anatomy. The seven Piper species <b>climb</b> via adventitious <b>roots,</b> and in cross section, the stems were generally eccentric and oblate, although a transversely elliptic stem was found in P. kadsura (Choisy) Ohwi and P. sintenense Hatus. A cambial variant with secondary growth of external primary vascular bundles and xylem in plates was observed in all species except Piper betle L., which developed another cambium variant with xylem furrowed deeply by parenchyma proliferation. The sclerenchymatous ring surrounding the medullary vascular bundles was always continuous except in P. betle, where it was discontinuous. Mucilage canals varied from absent to present {{in the center of}} the pith, or present in the pith and inner cortex. Different sizes of vessels dispersed throughout the stem were ring or diffuse porous. The numbers of medullary and peripheral vascular bundles were distinctive and the widths of rays were noticeably different in each species. Differences in the growth rate of the medullary vascular bundles produced two development types of vascular bundles, although in both types, the peripheral vascular bundles gradually lengthen and become separated from each other by wide rays.|$|R
30|$|We {{observed}} that the growth of medullary vascular bundles continues but gradually becomes minimal, while the peripheral vascular bundles continue to grow in these seven Piper species. This result {{is consistent with a}} previous report (Trueba et al. 2015) that secondary thickening is actually restricted to the peripheral vascular bundles in species undergoing secondary growth. The variations in the activity of the medullary vascular bundles and the peripheral vascular bundles result in unusual distribution patterns of xylem and phloem, which influences stem shape based on the shape of the peripheral vascular bundles (Beck 2011). The function of the flattened stems of lianas is related to their climbing habit, where they are either appressed to or leaning on the supporting tree’s trunk; this habit is entirely restricted in epiphytic lianas (Obaton 1960). The seven Piper species <b>climb</b> via adventitious <b>roots</b> and form a cambial variant type with flattened stems or oblate in that the broad face of the flattened axis contacts branches of trees (Carlquist 2001). The flattened stems as well as adventitious roots seem related to an epiphytic habit. More than two vascular bundle rings or two development types might be seen in stem of larger diameter, so it is valuable to observe more details in further studies.|$|R
6000|$|By {{this time}} the {{partisanship}} of the whites was unconcealed. Americans supplied Mataafa with ammunition; English and Americans openly subscribed together and sent boat-loads of provisions to his camp. One such boat started from Apia on a day of rain; it was pulled by six oars, three being paid by Moors, three by the MacArthurs; Moors himself and a clerk of the MacArthurs' were in charge; and the load included not only beef and biscuit, but three or four thousand rounds of ammunition. They came ashore in Laulii, and carried the gift to Mataafa. While they were yet in his house a bullet passed overhead; {{and out of his}} door they could see the Tamasese pickets on the opposite hill. Thence they {{made their way to the}} left flank of the Mataafa position next the sea. A Tamasese barricade was visible across the stream. It rained, but the warriors crowded in their shanties, squatted in the mud, and maintained an excited conversation. Balls flew; either faction, both happy as lords, spotting for the other in chance shots, and missing. One point is characteristic of that war; experts in native feeling doubt if it will characterise the next. The two white visitors passed without and between the lines to a rocky point upon the beach. The person of Moors was well known; the purpose of their coming to Laulii must have been already bruited abroad; yet they were not fired upon. From the point they spied a crow's nest, or hanging fortification, higher up; and, judging it was a good position for a general view, obtained a guide. He led them up a steep side of the mountain, where they must <b>climb</b> by <b>roots</b> and tufts of grass; and coming to an open hill-top with some scattered trees, bade them wait, let him draw the fire, and then be swift to follow. Perhaps a dozen balls whistled about him ere he had crossed the dangerous passage and dropped on the farther side into the crow's-nest; the white men, briskly following, escaped unhurt. The crow's-nest was built like a bartizan on the precipitous front of the position. Across the ravine, perhaps at five hundred yards, heads were to be seen popping up and down in a fort of Tamesese's. On both sides the same enthusiasm without council, the same senseless vigilance, reigned. Some took aim; some blazed before them at a venture. Now--when a head showed on the other side--one would take a crack at it, remarking that it would never do to [...] "miss a chance." [...] Now they would all fire a volley and bob down; a return volley rang across the ravine, and was punctually answered: harmless as lawn-tennis. The whites expostulated in vain. The warriors, drunken with noise, made answer by a fresh general discharge and bade their visitors run while it was time. Upon their return to headquarters, men were covering the front with sheets of coral limestone, two balls having passed through the house in the interval. Mataafa sat within, over his kava bowl, unmoved. The picture is of a piece throughout: excellent courage, super-excellent folly, a war of school-children; expensive guns and cartridges used like squibs or catherine-wheels on Guy Fawkes's Day.|$|R
40|$|As {{traditionally}} recognized, {{the tribe}} Hydrangeeae (Hydrangea s. l.) of the Cornales family Hydrangeaceae includes the warm temperate and tropical genera Hydrangea s. s. plus Broussaisia, Cardiandra, Decumaria, Deinanthe, Dichroa, Pileostegia, Platycrater and Schizophragma. A {{number of species}} of this tribe are popular woody ornamentals for their conspicuous inflorescences with attractive marginal flowers. The most recent revision of Hydrangea s. s. by McClintock (1957) subdivides this genus in the sections Hydrangea and Cornidia, each further divided in subsections. The H. sect. Cornidia comprises a yet undefined number of evergreen root-climbing species of nearly exclusive American distribution, {{with the exception of}} one species from Taiwan and the Philippines. The present study focuses on the tribe Hydrangeeae (Hydrangea s. l.) and H. sect. Cornidia. Knowledge of the phylogenetic relationships within the tribe has progressively improved in a series of molecular and morphological studies consistently recovering Hydrangea s. s. as paraphyletic with respect to the other genera in the tribe. A recent study by our research group included a number of Hydrangeeae representatives, recognizing two highly supported main clades within the tribe. However, due to heterogeneous distributions of rates of evolution and limited plastid variability, relationships among the different “genera” remained poorly understood. Despite the long record of phylogenetic studies in the tribe Hydrangeeae, a limited number of species from H. sect. Cornidia could be included in previous phylogenetic studies preventing a robust test of the monophyly of this section and its subsections, as well as a better knowledge of the evolutionary history of this group. The present PhD research project was divided in four subprojects. The aims of the first two were to gain insight in the phylogenetic relationships within Hydrangea s. l. and H. sect. Cornidia, respectively. In order to achieve these, we evaluated the performance of a number of coding and non-coding regions from the chloroplast and nuclear genomes for resolving and supporting phylogenetic relationships in these groups. The third subproject connects our fundamental phylogenetic research of Hydrangea s. l. to an applied study on hortensia breeding. Although hortensias are already more than two centuries important for horticultural trade, crosses between distantly related species have been problematic in this group hindering exploitation of economic value. The aim of this subproject was to inform the selection of potentially successful hortensia hybrid crosses, based on our recently improved phylogenetic knowledge in the group and genetic distances calculated from our extensive chloroplast nucleotide database. The fourth subproject focused on the characterization of the <b>root</b> <b>climbing</b> growth form in H. sect. Cornidia, using a multidisciplinary approach integrating plant biomechanics, architecture and anatomy. Our results represent a concrete progress in the reconstruction of a solid phylogenetic framework for Hydrangea s. l. and H. sect. Cornidia facilitating the application of the evidently needed taxonomical changes in these groups. Additionally, our results highlight the importance of “phylogenetic thinking” and its value in plant breeding. Furthermore, we present a contribution to the knowledge of the biology of the previously barely studied H. sect. Cornidia...|$|R
