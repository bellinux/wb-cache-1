5|$|As {{a result}} of the 1973 oil crisis, {{combined}} with the growing influence of Third World alignments such as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Non-Aligned Movement, less-powerful <b>countries</b> <b>had</b> more room to assert their independence and often showed themselves resistant to pressure from either superpower. Meanwhile, Moscow was forced to turn its attention inward to deal with the Soviet Union's deep-seated domestic economic problems. During this period, Soviet leaders such as Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin embraced the notion of détente.|$|E

5|$|Between 10 and 11million people {{watched the}} {{original}} six-episode broadcast on BBC One on Sunday evenings from 24 September to 29 October 1995. The episodes were repeated each week on BBC Two. The final episode of Pride and Prejudice had a {{market share of}} about 40 percent in Britain, by which time eight foreign <b>countries</b> <b>had</b> bought {{the rights to the}} serial. 3.7million Americans watched the first broadcast on the A Network, which aired the serial in double episodes on three consecutive evenings beginning 14 January 1996.|$|E
5|$|Following the U.S. {{financial}} crisis in 2008, {{fears of a}} sovereign debt crisis developed in 2009 among investors concerning some European states, with the situation becoming particularly tense in early 2010. Greece was most acutely affected, but fellow Eurozone members Cyprus, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain were also significantly affected. To {{be included in the}} eurozone, <b>countries</b> <b>had</b> to fulfil certain convergence criteria, but the meaningfulness of such criteria was diminished by the fact it was not enforced with the same level of strictness among countries.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the fall}} of the authoritarian {{government}} in Portugal in 1974, the Spanish government was the sole surviving dictatorship in Western Europe, where several countries in 1975 were ruled by socialist parties which had long loathed Franco for coming to power by overthrowing a socialist democracy. Hostility to the use of capital punishment was widespread in Western Europe at this time and most Western European <b>countries</b> <b>had</b> ceased using it.|$|E

5|$|However, unlike its neighbors, Argentina became {{capable of}} still having {{relatively}} healthy growth rates during the 1920s, not being as {{affected by the}} worldwide collapse on commodity prices such as Brazil and Chile.

5|$|In 1985, few <b>countries</b> <b>had</b> women's {{national}} football teams. While the sport gained popularity worldwide in later decades, the Gambia's national team only played its first game in 2007. That game was not FIFA-recognised. As of March 2012, {{the team was}} unranked by FIFA, and as of the following month the Gambia had not played in a FIFA-sanctioned match. The team has not participated in major regional and international tournaments, including the Women's World Cup, the 2010 African Women's Championship or the 2011 All-Africa Games.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, many <b>countries</b> <b>had</b> women's {{national}} football teams.

By 2009, however, Burundi had a FIFA-recognised senior national team nicknamed the Swallows and a FIFA-recognised Burundi women's under-20 national team. The under-20 team played one international match in 2002, one in 2004 and one in 2006.|$|E

She had won a bronze medal in the 2008 race in Beijing, China. Anja Dittmer was competing in her fourth Olympic triathlon, {{the only woman in}} the race doing so. The ITU World Triathlon Series champions of the four previous years in Jenkins (2008 & 2011) and Moffatt (2009 & 2010) were competing. Three <b>countries</b> <b>had</b> athletes competing {{for the first time in}} an Olympic triathlon.

5|$|Referring to {{the cases}} in which the High Court had upheld the wartime {{legislation}} allowing indefinite administrative detention, Kirby said that equivalent decisions in other <b>countries</b> <b>had</b> come to be regarded as embarrassing and incorrect, and should be likewise regarded in Australia. While conceding that the scope of the Parliament's powers with respect to defence will be greater in wartime than in peacetime, Kirby said that they could not extend so far as to displace fundamental constitutional requirements such as those in Chapter III.|$|E
5|$|The Malayan National Liberation Front (MNLF), an {{organisation}} of the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM), {{was formed}} in 1968 to support {{the overthrow of the}} governments of Singapore and Malaysia. The <b>countries</b> <b>had</b> been declared independent in 1965, but the communists rejected their separation. From 1968 to 1974, the armed struggle included planting booby trap bombs in public places. The MNLF was also involved in collecting supplies such as medicine, explosives and assorted equipment for the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), which was the military arm of the CPM operating in the border area of northern Malaysia and southern Thailand.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{has been}} {{coordinating}} a network called the International Regulatory Cooperation for Herbal Medicines {{to try to}} improve the quality of medical products made from medicinal plants and the claims made for them. In 2015, only around 20% of <b>countries</b> <b>had</b> well-functioning regulatory agencies, while 30% had none, and around half had limited regulatory capacity. In India, where Ayurveda has been practised for centuries, herbal remedies are the responsibility of a government department, AYUSH, under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of Bosnia, Bulgaria, Macedonia (which had pegged their currencies against the Deutsche Mark) and Cape Verde (formerly pegged to the Portuguese escudo), all of these non-EU <b>countries</b> <b>had</b> a currency peg to the French Franc before pegging their currencies to the euro. Pegging a country's currency to a major currency {{is regarded as a}} safety measure, especially for currencies of areas with weak economies, as the euro is seen as a stable currency, prevents runaway inflation and encourages foreign investment due to its stability.|$|E
5|$|A state {{wishing to}} devalue, {{or at least}} check the {{appreciation}} of its currency, must work within {{the constraints of the}} prevailing International monetary system. During the 1930s, <b>countries</b> <b>had</b> relatively more direct control over their exchange rates through the actions of their central banks. Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s, markets substantially increased in influence, with market forces largely setting the exchange rates for an increasing number of countries. However, a state's central bank can still intervene in the markets to effect a devaluation – if it sells its own currency to buy other currencies then this will cause the value of its own currency to fall – a practice common with states that have a managed exchange rate regime. Less directly, quantitative easing (common in 2009 and 2010), tends to lead to a fall {{in the value of the}} currency even if the central bank does not directly buy any foreign assets.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 104 athletes won medals for their NOCs, but the athletes from Norway and Finland stood out and {{dominated}} the Games, winning 17 and 11 medals, respectively. The United States and Great Britain {{tied for third}} place in the count of total medals, with four each. Athletes from 10 of the 16 participating NOCs won at least one medal; eight won at least one gold medal. Many of the athletes who won these medals had already returned to their home countries {{by the time the}} medals were awarded, on 5 February, and other participants from their <b>countries</b> <b>had</b> to take the medals to the winning athletes.|$|E
5|$|As a {{powerful}} long-distance migrant, the nominate subspecies of Pacific swift has occurred as a vagrant far from its normal range. Birds {{have been recorded}} from Brunei, the Maldives, New Zealand and Macquarie Island, {{and there have been}} multiple occurrences in the Seychelles. In the US, this species is casual in the Pribilof and Aleutian Islands; a claimed 2010 sighting from the Yukon will be the first for Canada and the mainland of North America if ratified. In South America, there is a 1959 record from Colombia. There are 13 European records as of 2013, from Denmark (two), Spain, Sweden (four) and the UK (seven). It is possible that this overstates the true number of visiting birds. All the listed <b>countries</b> <b>had</b> a sighting on different dates in the summer of 2013 which could be due to a single wandering bird. The four most recent English records in 2005, 2008, 2011 and 2013 all included sightings at Spurn, East Yorkshire and may refer to one returning individual.|$|E
5|$|At the 34th Session of the UN General Assembly, {{represent}}atives of the People's Republic of Kampuchea and Democratic Kampuchea both claimed the right to represent their country. The former also notified the member nations of the UN Security Council {{that it was the}} sole legitimate representative of Kampuchea and its people. In response, the UN Credentials Committee decided to recognise Democratic Kampuchea by a vote of six to three, despite the Khmer Rouge's blood-stained record while in power. Accordingly, {{representatives of}} Democratic Kampuchea were allowed to be seated in the General Assembly, with strong support from China. By January 1980, 29 <b>countries</b> <b>had</b> established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of Kampuchea, yet nearly 80 countries still recognised the legitimacy of the deposed Democratic Kampuchea. At the same time, the Western powers and the member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) also voiced strong condemnation of Vietnam’s use of force to remove the Khmer Rouge regime.|$|E
