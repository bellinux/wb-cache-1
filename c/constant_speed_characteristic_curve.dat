40|$|As the induced-voltage {{commutation}} type commutatorless motor (Thy-CLM) {{does not}} need external commutation elements such as capacitors and reactors, its construction is simple compared with the compulsive commutation type CLM. But, as the commutation of the thyristors depends on the armature induced-voltage, the setting angle has to be equal to or larger than the commutation margin angle. Therefore, for the Thy-CLM, if the setting angle is smaller than the commutation‐margin angle, its normal operation {{as well as its}} starting are imposible. This paper describes the effects of the cumulative-and differential-compound field windings over the load characteristics of the transistor-CLM(TR-CLM), based on the experiments, and the following results are obtained. (1) For the TR-CLM the setting angle can be chosen in a range wider than that for the Thy-CLM, and therefore the former is superior in starting and steady operation characteristics. (2) The differential-compond field winding results in a good <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> <b>characteristic,</b> but in a heavy load condition, the powerfactor and efficiency decline. (3) The cumulative-compound field winding suppresses the decrease of the load leading-angle, and the load limit is widened.

40|$|In the {{scientific}} literature concerning renewable energies there have been proposals {{for the use of}} Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as a tool to estimate the mean wind speed at a target station for which only incomplete data series are available. In general terms, the wind speeds recorded at neighbouring reference stations are used as signals of the input layer of multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures. An analysis is undertaken in this paper {{of the extent to which}} estimation of the wind speed, the wind power density and the power output of an installed wind turbine at a target site is affected by the number of reference stations, the degree of correlation between the wind speeds of the reference stations and the target station, the wind direction and the manner in which the direction signal is introduced into the input layer. For the purposes of this study mean hourly wind speeds and directions were used which had been recorded at twenty two weather stations located in the Canary Archipelago (Spain) in 2002 and 2006. The power-wind <b>speed</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>curves</b> of five wind turbines of different rated power were also used. The MLP architectures were trained using the backpropagation algorithm. Amongst other conclusions reached with the tests performed with the set of data not used in the training nor in the validation of the models is that the estimation errors tend to decrease as the number of reference stations used increases, independently of the existing correlation coefficient values between the reference stations and the candidate station. It was also observed that if input signals of angular wind direction and wind speed are used then the number of reference stations required to achieve a certain decrease in the error is lower than the number required if only wind speed input signals are used. By using multiple reference stations with input signals of angular wind direction and speed, error reductions have been achieved for some stations in the estimation of the wind power density and the power output of wind turbines, with respect to the case of a single reference station and identical input signals, of 75 % and 62 %, respectively.

Because of this variation nature of wind speed, every wind turbine demonstrates a unique performance and delivers a unique power. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study conducted to estimate and compare a series of medium size wind turbines (2 - 3 MW) from their operational point of view. For the purpose of full operation analysis in this study, 8 commercially available wind turbines of similar sizes (in terms of their rated power in MW) have been chosen. For comparison analysis wind <b>speed</b> <b>characteristics,</b> and power <b>curve</b> of these wind turbines were used. To reach its objectives, this paper is divided to two parts.

On the other hand, machine building applications evolve more and more from <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> and load <b>characteristics</b> to varying <b>speed</b> and load applications. Therefore, the motor system that is used evolves more and more from direct online (DOL) to motors fed by a variable speed drive (VSD). However, current efficiency standardization focuses on DOL applications, and can by consequence not offer assistance to the machine builder to select the most efficient motor-VSD combination for his particular varying load application. The goal {{of this paper is to}} present a methodology that allows to predict the energy consumption for a specific motor-VSD combination and a specific varying speed-load application, using the fairly new concept of iso efficiency contours.
