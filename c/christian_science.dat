5|$|At a {{time when}} medical {{practice}} was in its infancy, and patients often fared better if left alone, the <b>Christian</b> <b>Science</b> message was a welcome one. In 1882 Eddy set up the Massachusetts Metaphysical College in Boston, where, for $300 for a 12-lesson course, she and her students taught mostly women how to become <b>Christian</b> <b>Science</b> practitioners, licensed to offer <b>Christian</b> <b>Science</b> prayer to the sick. The college made Eddy a wealthy woman; when she died in December 1910 her estate was valued at $1.5 million.|$|E
