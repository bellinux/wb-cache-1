25|$|Several {{species of}} plants have been named for William Baldwin. Among those names that are still in use, we have, {{including}} authors, the following names: Eleocharis baldwinii (John Torrey) Alvan Wentworth Chapman, Rhynchospora baldwinii Asa Gray, Saccharum baldwinii Curt Sprengel, <b>Clematis</b> baldwinii John Torrey and Asa Gray, Paronychia baldwinii (Torrey and Gray) Eduard Fenzl and Wilhelm Walpers, Eryngium baldwinii Curt Sprengel, Vernonia baldwinii John Torrey, Xyris baldwiniana Josef Schultes, and Matelea baldwyniana (Robert Sweet) Robert Woodson.|$|E
25|$|Aggregate fruits {{form from}} single flowers that have {{multiple}} carpels {{which are not}} joined together, i.e. each pistil contains one carpel. Each pistil forms a fruitlet, and collectively the fruitlets are called an etaerio. Four types of aggregate fruits include etaerios of achenes, follicles, drupelets, and berries. Ranunculaceae species, including <b>Clematis</b> and Ranunculus have an etaerio of achenes, Calotropis has an etaerio of follicles, and Rubus species like raspberry, have an etaerio of drupelets. Annona have an etaerio of berries.|$|E
25|$|According to the Alcheringa, the {{dreaming of}} the local Aboriginal peoples, Mount Keira is Geera, the {{daughter}} of Oola-boola-woo, the West Wind. The story {{of the creation of}} Mount Keira is tied {{to the creation of the}} Five Islands, which sit just off the Wollongong coast. In the story, Oola-boola-woo had six daughters, Mimosa, Wilga, Lilli Pilli, Wattle, <b>Clematis</b> and Geera. They lived a-top the Illawarra escarpment, and one by one the first five children misbehaved, raising the ire of Oola-boola-woo, who cast them and the stone beneath them out to sea, forming the Five Islands.|$|E
500|$|Many {{of the old}} roses had cultivars {{that grew}} very long canes, which could be tied to trellises or against walls. These older {{varieties}} are called [...] "ramblers", rather than [...] "climbers". Climbing plants in the traditional cottage garden included European honeysuckle (Lonicera periclymenum) and Traveller's Joy (<b>Clematis</b> vitalba). The modern cottage garden includes many <b>Clematis</b> hybrids that have the old appeal, with sparse foliage {{that allows them to}} grow through roses and trees, and along fences and arbors. There are also many <b>Clematis</b> species used in the modern cottage garden, including <b>Clematis</b> armandii, <b>Clematis</b> chrysocoma, and <b>Clematis</b> flammula. Popular honeysuckles for cottage gardens include Japanese honeysuckle and Lonicera tragophylla.|$|E
500|$|Forest Park {{and other}} areas of the {{watershed}} have an understory of well-developed shrubs including [...] ferns, Oregon-grape, vine maple, salal, red huckleberry, Fendler's waterleaf, Indian plum, salmonberry, and stinging nettle. [...] Among the prominent wildflowers are wild ginger, Hooker's fairy bells, vanilla leaf, evergreen violet, and trillium. Rare or uncommon species include old conifers, Western wahoo shrubs, and ornamental dawn redwoods. Invasive species are English ivy, European holly, <b>clematis,</b> morning glory, and Himalayan blackberry.|$|E
500|$|About 37percent of the {{watershed}} is wooded. Dominant trees are red alder, bigleaf maple, Douglas-fir, western redcedar, and western hemlock. The forest understory in the Tryon Creek State Natural Area includes many trilliums; they are celebrated each spring during the park's Trillium Festival. More than 90species of wildflower such as fringecup {{are found in}} the park as well as plants such as sword fern. Invasive species found in many parts of {{the watershed}} include English ivy, Himalayan blackberry, English holly, garlic mustard, and western <b>clematis.</b>|$|E
500|$|Waves {{washed up}} mounds {{of sand and}} debris across Banyan Boulevard, <b>Clematis</b> Street, and Datura Street, to Olive Avenue (State Road 5). According to county coroner T. M. Rickards, the streets were [...] "shoulder-deep in debris. The {{suffering}} throughout was beyond words." [...] A total of 1,711homes were destroyed and damaged 6,369others suffered damage, leaving about 2,100families were left homeless. Additionally, the hurricane demolished 268businesses and impacted 490others. There was severe damage totaling just under $13.8million and eleven deaths, with one from being fatally struck by debris.

500|$|On September 2, a {{fleet of}} eight {{aircraft}} evacuated all white residents from West End, Grand Bahama, to Daytona Beach, Florida. While the storm was near peak intensity on September3, the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings from Miami to Melbourne, Florida, with storm warnings extending northward to Jacksonville. Later that day, storm warnings, were issued from Key West to Cedar Key. About 2,500people evacuated by train from areas around Lake Okeechobee. By evening on September3, high tides sent sea spray over coastal seawalls in Palm Beach County as residents boarded up buildings; structures on <b>Clematis</b> Street in West Palm Beach {{were said to be}} a [...] "solid front" [...] of plywood. Along the coast, observers reported very rough seas as the eye neared land.|$|E
500|$|The Provence rose or Rosa centifolia is {{the full}} and fat [...] "cabbage rose" [...] {{made famous by}} Dutch masters in their 17th-century paintings. These very {{fragrant}} shrub roses grow 5ft tall and wide, with a floppy habit that is aided by training on an arch or pillar. The centifolia roses have produced many descendants that are also cottage garden favorites, including varieties of moss rose (roses with attractive 'mossy' growth on their flower stalks and flower buds). Unlike most modern hybrids, the older roses bloom on the previous year's wood, so they aren't pruned back severely each year. Also as they don't bloom continuously, they can share their branches with later-flowering climbers such as <b>Clematis</b> vines, which use the rose branches for support. A rose in the cottage garden is not segregated with other roses, with bare earth or mulch underneath', but is casually blended with other flowers, vines, and groundcover.|$|E
500|$|The {{breeding}} season is shorter {{than that of}} other fairywrens, occurring from October (rarely September) through to December. Constructed solely by the female, the nest is generally situated in thick vegetation and around [...] above the ground. It is a round or domed structure made of loosely woven grasses and spider webs, with an entrance in one side. The interior may be lined with finer grass and material from <b>Clematis</b> pubescens and Banksia grandis. One or, rarely, two broods may be laid in a season, the second being laid on average 51 days after the first. A clutch consists {{of two or three}} matte cream-white eggs, tapered oval in shape with reddish-brown splotches and spots, measuring [...] The female incubates the eggs alone for around an hour at a time, after which the male calls her and she will leave to forage urgently for 15–30 minutes before returning. Her long tail is often bent from the cramped nest space and is a useful field indicator of nesting. Incubation takes 14 to 15days, a day less in later broods, and an estimated 94% of eggs hatch successfully. The newly hatched nestlings are altricial–raw red in colour, naked and blind. Within a day, their skin darkens to blue–grey colour as their feathers develop underneath. Sheathed primary feathers emerge through the skin by the third day and eyes begin to open on the fifth day and fully open on the next. Young are fed and their fecal sacs removed by all group members for 11–12days, by which time they are fledged. Though fully feathered, their tails and wings are not fully grown and they are poor fliers. Their wings take another 10 days to develop fully, during which time they generally stay well hidden in cover near the nest. Parents and helper birds will feed them for around one month after fledging. Young birds often remain in the family group as helpers {{for a year or more}} before moving to another group. Birds reach sexual maturity at one year of age, but females tend not to breed until their third year as breeding vacancies are scarce. The nests of red-winged fairywrens rarely play host to brood parasites, though parasitism by the Horsfield's bronze cuckoo (Chrysococcyx basalis) and the fan-tailed cuckoo (Cacomantis flabelliformis) has been recorded.|$|E

2500|$|The right {{column was}} to advance direct to Gebel Medwa {{and the left}} column was to move via Wadi Toweiwia south of Matruh, then west round the Senussi flank to cut off their retreat. An Azalea-class sloop, HMS <b>Clematis</b> was to provide gunfire support to any target in range.

The right column moved forward silently but at [...] Senussi outposts raised the alarm and engaged the column which stopped until the light improved. Many Senussi could be seen in the hills to the south and south-east but not on Gebel Medwa, due to the sudden appearance of the British. The Gebel Medwa was occupied to guard the right flank and then the advance was to continue down the road, when a Senussi field gun fired on the road with some accuracy. The Notts battery replied and silenced the gun; shells from <b>Clematis</b> [...] away, fell on the Senussi position.|$|E
