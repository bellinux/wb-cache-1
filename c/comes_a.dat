5|$|After {{saving the}} Mushroom Kingdom in Super Mario Bros. 3, {{brothers}} Mario and Luigi {{decide to go}} on holiday to a place called Dinosaur Land, where there are many types of dinosaurs. However, while resting on the beach, Princess Toadstool disappears. When Mario and Luigi wake up, they try to find her and, after hours of searching, come across a giant egg in the forest.

Mario and Luigi soon realise {{that it must be}} the evil King Bowser and his Koopalings.|$|E
50|$|In a {{facsimile}} of {{the first}} part of the original manuscript, included in Singer of the Bush, a collection of Paterson's works published by Lansdowne Press in 1983, the first two verses appear as follows:Oh there once was a swagman camped in the billabong,Under the shade of a Coolibah tree,And he sang as he looked at the old billy boiling,Who'll <b>come</b> <b>a</b> waltzing Matilda with me?Chorus:Who'll <b>come</b> <b>a</b> waltzin' Matilda my darling,Who'll <b>come</b> <b>a</b> waltzin' Matilda with me?Waltzing Matilda and leading <b>a</b> water bag,Who'll <b>come</b> <b>a</b> waltzing Matilda with me?Down <b>came</b> <b>a</b> jumbuck to drink at the water hole,Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him in glee,And he sang as he put him away in the tucker bag,You'll <b>come</b> <b>a</b> waltzin' Matilda with me.Chorus:You'll <b>come</b> <b>a</b> waltzing Matilda my darling,You'll <b>come</b> <b>a</b> waltzing Matilda with me.Waltzing Matilda and leading <b>a</b> water bag,You'll <b>come</b> <b>a</b> waltzing Matilda with me.|$|R

5|$|On March 28, 1978, Paramount {{assembled}} the largest press conference {{held at the}} studio since Cecil B. DeMille announced he was making The Ten Commandments. Eisner announced that Academy-Award winning director Robert Wise would direct a film adaptation of the television series, titled Star Trek—The Motion Picture. Wise had only seen a few Star Trek episodes, so Paramount gave him about a dozen to watch. The budget was projected at $15million. Dennis Clark (<b>Comes</b> <b>a</b> Horseman) was invited to rewrite the script and to include Spock, but he disliked Roddenberry, who demanded sole credit. Livingston returned as writer, and although he also found Roddenberry unreasonable, Wise and Katzenberg convinced him to continue rewriting the script throughout production.|$|E
5|$|Parisians tend {{to share}} the same movie-going trends {{as many of the}} world's global cities, with cinemas {{primarily}} dominated by Hollywood-generated film entertainment. French cinema <b>comes</b> <b>a</b> close second, with major directors (réalisateurs) such as Claude Lelouch, Jean-Luc Godard, and Luc Besson, and the more slapstick/popular genre with director Claude Zidi as an example. European and Asian films are also widely shown and appreciated. On 2 February 2000, Philippe Binant realised the first digital cinema projection in Europe, with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by Texas Instruments, in Paris.|$|E
5|$|The {{exercises}} are intended as notes to guide a spiritual director who is leading someone else through {{an experience of}} Christian meditation. The entire experience takes about 30 days and often involves a daily interview with the director. The process begins with {{a consideration of the}} purpose of one's life and the relationship with the rest of creation. It is followed by a week of meditation about sin and its consequences. Next <b>comes</b> <b>a</b> period of meditating on the events of the life of Jesus, and another for thinking about his suffering and death. The final week is to experience the joy of the resurrection, and in conclusion to reflect on God's love and the response of love for God.|$|E

5|$|While {{planning}} his revenge, however, Aloha's turn to {{face the}} fear of having his planet attacked <b>comes.</b> <b>A</b> hostile alien invader known as Captain Kabuki (voiced by Lorelei King) descends upon Little Muu and starts taking it apart, piece by piece, contrasting on what Aloha himself had once tried to do to Crater Planet in the first game. Aloha flees the onslaught in his space pod, and lands on an asteroid far away from Little Muu, where he calls for help from his sworn enemy, Universal City Hall. Once again, Robbit is dispatched to help, and manages to free the parts of Little Muu which Kabuki has taken, and ultimately faces Kabuki one-on-one in mortal combat. Robbit defeats Kabuki, resulting in the latter escaping.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Fire was {{released}} on October 20, 2009 in Canada, and on February 2, 2010 (the soonest possible date Tee Pee Records could give the band) in the United States. Priestess chose for an earlier release in Canada {{so that they could}} begin touring in support of the record at last. All CD pressings of the album contain 11 tracks, but with the deluxe edition from Tee Pee Records <b>comes</b> <b>a</b> code to obtain a 13-track edition from the Internet. It contains the original 11 tracks, plus two bonus tracks. (As the band are signed only to Indica Records in Canada, all deluxe editions from Tee Pee Records are only released outside of Canada.) Two deluxe editions were released by Tee Pee Records: both came with the code for the Internet download, and one came with an exclusive T-shirt as well.|$|E
5|$|The common {{starling}} is a noisy bird. Its song {{consists of}} a wide variety of both melodic and mechanical-sounding noises as part of a ritual succession of sounds. The male is the main songster and engages in bouts of song lasting for a minute or more. Each of these typically includes four varieties of song type, which follow each other in a regular order without pause. The bout starts with a series of pure-tone whistles and these are followed by the main part of the song, a number of variable sequences that often incorporate snatches of song mimicked from other species of bird and various naturally occurring or man-made noises. The structure and simplicity of the sound mimicked is of greater importance than the frequency with which it occurs. In some instances, a wild starling has been observed to mimic a sound it has heard only once. Each sound clip is repeated several times before the bird moves on to the next. After this variable section <b>comes</b> <b>a</b> number of types of repeated clicks followed by a final burst of high-frequency song, again formed of several types. Each bird has its own repertoire with more proficient birds having a range of up to 35 variable song types and as many as 14 types of clicks.|$|E

60|$|<b>A</b> {{minute later}} <b>came</b> <b>a</b> fierce gust of wind, {{followed}} by {{a second and then}} a third. Around spun the biplane and then tilted up as if about to go over. Then <b>came</b> <b>an</b> unexpected ripping and tearing sound.|$|R

25|$|In {{the human}} level, with the {{development}} of consciousness, love, although continuous with its lower forms, attains a higher form because of its relation to reason. In the beginning these two factors are in a natural harmony, but the one doesn't have conscious access to the other. Each one operates almost separately from the other. Then <b>comes</b> <b>a</b> stage where reason and love come in rapport and conflict with each other, yet the important factor is that they start coming simultaneously in the conscious sphere. Then <b>comes</b> <b>a</b> third stage where a synthesis of love and reason is achieved to bring an altogether new type of consciousness, best described as superconsciousness.|$|E

60|$|It was cold, {{and evening}} was falling into dusk. Down the high-road came wild half-ragged men on ponies, in all degrees of costume and not-costume: came four wide-eyed cows {{stepping}} down-hill round the corner, and three delicate, beautiful merino sheep which stared {{at us with}} their prominent, gold-curious eyes: <b>came</b> <b>an</b> ancient, ancient man with <b>a</b> stick: <b>came</b> <b>a</b> stout-chested peasant carrying <b>a</b> long wood-pole: <b>came</b> <b>a</b> straggle of alert and triumphant goats, long-horned, long-haired, jingling their bells.
