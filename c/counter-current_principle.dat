40|$|The {{complete}} {{loading of}} weakly acid resin particles could be attained by multi-stage exchange with uranyl nitrate solutions of growingconcentration. The setting of pH-values {{for the individual}} stages was achieved {{by the addition of}} ammonia. For the technical implementation, a loading cascade was constructed, consisting of 4 stages and working according to the <b>counter-current</b> <b>principle.</b> The loaded resin particles obtained by this method can be further processed into fuel particles by subsequent heat treatment...|$|E
40|$|A new {{counter-current}} {{process has}} been developed for large-scale enantiomer separations, based {{on a combination of}} enantioselective complexation in solution, counter-current fractionation and electrodialysis. The <b>counter-current</b> <b>principle</b> is obtained by the electrophoretic transport of the free enantiomer through size-selective membranes, whereas, the complexed enantiomer is retained by the membranes and is transported with the liquid flow in the opposite direction. This design has been validated in an electrodialysis stack containing 20 membrane compartments. A racemic mixture has been fed at one side of the closed system, simulating one half of a complete separation apparatus. Using this set-up the enantiomeric excess (e. e.) and the concentrations of both enantiomers have been determined, {{as a function of the}} current density at a constant liquid flow velocity. As a model system the separation of,-tryptophan in combination with a-cyclodextrin as the chiral selector is used. Despite the low selectivity of this selector (1. 12), an e. e. difference of 14...|$|E
40|$|The solar to fuel {{efficiency}} of a thermochemical water or carbon dioxide splitting process based on redox reactions with metal oxides and driven by concentrated solar energy highly {{depends on the}} heat recovery of sensible heat from the redox material. Today, no system exists that recovers heat between two redox particles streams at a temperature of about 1400 ï¿½C without the risk of an undesired reoxidation of the particles. Furthermore, a <b>counter-current</b> <b>principle</b> is essential to reach satisfactorily high heat recovery rates. In this work, we introduce a new concept utilizing a solid heat transfer medium {{in the form of}} spheres for heat recovery from particles. The mixing of redox particle and heat transfer spheres leads to a high surface area and enables an improved heat transfer. An appropriate connection of multiple heat transfer stages allows a quasi-counter-current heat transfer principle. A performance model of the system determines the heat recovery rate to be reached by the system...|$|E
