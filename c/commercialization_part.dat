3000|$|A huge gap {{has been}} {{identified}} in the Jordanian market between the theoretical teaching of universities and what {{the world of work}} actually requires. Students graduate with little to no practical experience, which is frustrating for employers. In order to encourage more innovative human capital, and in order to invest in the workers of the future, the educational system needs to include more practical applications in addition to theory. This will provide the rising generation with the right tools for the job market, with both theoretical and practical knowledge; human capital will be innovative, reducing the time wasted on training staff for one particular job with no capacity to innovate and create. One interviewee summarized the obstacles firstly in: Human capital “We don’t have enough talents or the right talents in the country today in terms of having a huge gap between the industry and the university education. Output from universities does not match what we need in most of the time as they have to reeducate the graduates depending on the needs of the market”. And secondly in understanding innovation: “As innovation is not about starting a business, innovation might be in everything and you might take it into your company, whether you are starting a business or working on commercialization—which is commercializing it in a different way. The <b>commercialization</b> <b>part</b> is the hassle. If you take your project outside, to the states or to Europe and tell them, here you go that’s my innovation, they will not take it into consideration, not because it’s not good enough but because they’ve never heard of Jordan as a country that innovates, or has innovation. A bit of a problem when they want to take your innovation further. The biggest problem is taking the innovation and putting it out in the market, and this is what we’re working on fixing right now. It is an existing challenge.” [...]...|$|E

Such a shared vision is a corner stone of a planned strategic research agenda for European LT research and innovation in the next ten years. More than one hundred commercial companies and other organizations have actively participated in the process by recognized experts in technology and <b>commercialization.</b> A central <b>part</b> of the resulting vision paper, "The Future European Multilingual Information Society. Towards a Strategic Research Agenda for Multilingual Europe", is a selection of commercially attractive and socially relevant application scenarios. In this talk I will summarize the consequences of these application visions and their enabling technologies on the availability of resources. Although I will concentrate on monolingual and multilingual data, I will also comment on linguistic descriptions and tools such as lexical resources and basic processing components. In order to provide all these prerequisites for our dream technologies when they are needed, novel ways of collecting, producing, maintaining and sharing data will have to be pursued...|$|R

40|$|The nonprofit {{sector is}} viewed as one of value and voice for those in need, but the trend of commercialism is {{resulting}} in questioning such virtues for the sector {{and its role in}} civil society. For the most <b>part,</b> <b>commercialization</b> has a stigma attached to it in relationship with the nonprofit sector. Are the lines too blurred? Is the mission lost? What does this mean for maintaining civil society? These are all questions surrounding the practice of commercialism. This paper explores the growing utilization of commercial activity within the nonprofit sector and its potential effects, both beneficial and harmful. The first section introduces commercialization and takes a brief look at the concept itself through the current environment and practice. The section continues with an overview of contributing factors – specifically revenue sources and relationships driving the change in practice; benefits and risks; and a focus on the mission. The second section discusses future implications commercialization has on the nonprofit sector and on civil society, followed by concluding thoughts. We are in a competitive environment where it will no longer be sufficient to point out our long history and experience for providing services. – Michael Reagan, President, Proaction Behavioral Health Alliance (2006) Nonprofits search for new sources of revenue, and this brings them into increasingly complex relationships {{with the rest of the}} economy.

40|$|This {{document}} details the efforts towards the automated solution phase synthesis of {{fragments of the}} Xcc bacteria 2 ̆ 7 s lipopolysaccharide. The target fragment is a trisaccharide consisting of two glucosamine monomers with a 1 - 6 beta linkage connected to a 2 - 6 alpha link to 3 -Deoxy-d-manno-Octulosonic Acid (KDO). First, the field of glycobiology is introduced and the challenges associated with the advancement of oligosaccharide synthesis highlighted. Then the synthesis of the glucosamine building block is described. Different approaches to the same general building block are investigated for the best possible route to the building block. Approaches that require less reaction steps, cheaper reagents, easier intermediates to handle, easier purification methods and safer reagents are sought and reported. From the quest to produce easier intermediates, {{a different type of}} glycosyl donor, N-aryl trifluoroacetimidate donor is explored. Due to the change in stability observed with changing the substituent on the aryl group, stability studies of different methyl N-aryl trifluoroacetimidates are further studied. From the stability studies, the mechanism of acetimidate activation can be confirmed. Some acetimidates exhibit favorable characteristics and these are further studied for their role and ability as alkylating agents. Since some are crystalline at room temperature some acetimidates are reported for their appropriateness in <b>commercialization.</b> The other <b>part</b> of the target LPS fragment is KDO and this rare and expensive sugar is synthesized through biosynthesis. Major problems with purification resulted in the chemical synthesis of KDO from oxaloacetic acid and this method also presents the same major problem. Future directions include better purification protocols for KDO and more runs of glucosamine building blocks on the automated solution phase workstation developed in the lab...|$|R
40|$|A {{frequent}} {{problem in}} society today {{and something that}} humans {{need to deal with}} on a daily basis is the lack of communication. For a long time, mankind has strived to come up with new solutions for how to best communicate information through the exchange of thoughts, messages through voice, video signals or writing, no matter where on the globe we are. It has become more important for companies to be able to communicate in a world where <b>commercialization</b> is a <b>part</b> of reality and where companies must be able to communicate in order to not fall behind in the increasing competition. The increasingly growing world has also led to that the society and the environment has been affected adversely. Corporate social responsibility, CSR, also called corporate social enterprise has taken its place to counteract the negative consequences of humanity's progressive, technical development. CSR can be defined as the active and voluntary contributions to improving the social, economic and environmental perspectives from companies, usually in order to improve their competitiveness, values and dignity. CSR has become a new phenomenon today that companies must adapt to and which has also become something that businesses are keen to relate to and is considered as a strategic component of the company's brand. The knowledge of how to communicate about CSR to a company's customers has been unsatisfactory, causing communication gap between companies and customers. Therefore, our thesis is based on the issues concerning corporate communicative activity about CSR towards the private sector. This study focuses specifically on a case-company where we in detail study how the company views its own communication in relation with how they work with CSR and how customers perceive the company's CSR communication. Furthermore, our paper builds on a deductive approach with qualitative approaches. The collected empirical data is based on a case study on cases where the primary data is based on interviews with a company representative and the company's customers. The essay is based on theories concerning the appropriate areas within communication, brands and CSR. In the study's theoretical framework, a model has been created where the communication gap concerning CSR has been identified. The results of our study suggest that there is a discrepancy in the communication between the company and clients regarding CSR-communication. It turned out that the company does not want to communicate about their CSR-work to the full, while customers are not at all expecting the company to communicate about their CSR efforts, however, customers would appreciate getting CSR- information given to them, which may {{have a positive impact on}} the company brand image.

40|$|In 2009 the Norwegian Water and Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) {{received}} 108 million NOK {{from the}} Norwegian Government to map land areas in risk for potential landslides. Norway, {{due to its}} geographical structure, is {{to a large extent}} exposed to geological hazards such as landslides. These arise due to that the strength in the ground deteriorate so far that the ground is no longer in equilibrium, but begins to move. Ground movement is due to natural processes but can also occur to underground construction work or extraction of oil and gas. Geologist can today by manual measurements detect ground movement over time and announce when an area is exposed for potential landslides. Manual measurements ground movement monitoring is efficient considering small land areas, however when one wants to monitor large areas (above 1 km 2) these methods can quickly become extremely time consuming and expensive. In addition, manual measurements do not enable monitoring in unreachable terrain and cannot provide historical ground movement data. Generic Synthetic Aperture Radar (GSAR) is a software platform developed by the Norwegian research institute Norut. This software can together with satellite data produce images illustrating ground movement and therefore help geologist to risk assess areas exposed for landslides. Norut believes that there is a commercial potential in GSAR however they do not possess any business competence. Therefore they contacted Technology Transfer Office Nord (TTO) AS to find entrepreneurs that possess competence to commercialize GSAR. Consequently TTO contacted us the three students at the master’s program Business Creation and Entrepreneurship to initiate the <b>commercialization</b> process as <b>part</b> of their master thesis. The project is today named Eagle Eye. We used both, primary and secondary data to evaluate the GSAR technology. By understanding its functions and possibilities in satellite surveillance we could discover that large scale monitoring was an application area where GSAR would provide most value to the customer. This knowledge was later used in a comprehensive market research to confirm the need for large scale monitoring and which customer groups Eagle Eye should target. We have made 20 qualitative interviews with potential customers to Eagle Eye and retrieved valuable customer information regarding their values, purchasing powers and their needs. The 20 different companies were later divided into seven different segments. After evaluating these segments we ended up with two most attractive segments named, Resource Extraction and Geo-Hazards. Eagle Eye will initially target these two segments by selling historical ground movement images of large areas and thereof provide extensive societal, economic and business value. In addition GSAR enables Eagle Eye to operate in several markets which opens up for high profitability and long-term sustainability...|$|R
40|$|O cultivo do feijoeiro no Brasil é típico de pequena propriedade, onde parte da produção é destinada à comercialização,e parte é armazenada para o consumo {{familiar}} ou utilização como semente. Durante o armazenamento, os grãos de feijão estão sujeitos a perdas devido ao ataque do caruncho Acanthoscelides obtectus Say (Coleoptera: Bruchidae), que pode causar grandes prejuízos, comprometendo a sua qualidade, direta e indiretamente. Com o objetivo de avaliar o efeito de preparados homeopáticos e fitoterápicos no {{manejo de}} A. obtectus, foram conduzidos experimentos nos quais se observou a efetividade dos tratamentos sobre a mortalidade e repelência de adultos, e seu efeito sobre a progênie emergida. Bioensaios com extratos de Rosmarinus officinalis, Ruta graveolens e Artemisia absinthium e os preparados homeopáticos Taraxacum, Chenopodium anthelminticum, nosódio macerado e nosódio triturado de A. obtectus foram conduzidos no Laboratório de Homeopatia e Saúde Vegetal. Utilizaram-se 3 mL do tratamento para 100 g de feijão, enquanto que para os bioensaios com folhas verdes inteiras, verdes moídas, secas inteiras e secas moídas de R. officinalis, R. graveolens e A. absinthium, foram utilizados 0, 3 g para 10 g de feijão. O bioensaio de mortalidade foi conduzido em delineamento inteiramente casualizado, com os tratamentos fitoterápicos, para os quais foram colocados 20 g de feijão tratado em uma placa de Petri, onde foram introduzidos 20 adultos de A. obtectus com até 24 horas. As avaliações constaram da contagem e retirada dos insetos mortos durante 10 dias. As placas avaliadas foram vedadas e armazenadas até completarem 45 dias, data na qual foi contado o número de insetos emergidos. Apresentaram efeito sobre a mortalidade de adultos os tratamentos com as folhas de R. graveolens e A. absinthium, enquanto que os tratamentos com os extratos alcoólicos das três espécies e as folhas de R. officinalis não causaram mortalidade de adultos, sendo que nenhum dos tratamentos afetou significativamente a progênie emergida. O bioensaio de repelência foi conduzido em blocos casualizados, em caixas de múltipla escolha, nas quais foram distribuídas parcelas com feijão tratado em forma circular, na qual foram liberados 200 adultos de A. obtectus com idade até 24 horas. A contagem dos insetos presentes em cada tratamento se iniciou após 12 horas da montagem, estendendo-se por 10 dias consecutivos. Após este período, os insetos foram retirados, e as placas foram vedadas e armazenadas por 35 dias para realizar a contagem da progênie emergida. As folhas moídas de R. officinalis e verdes de A. absinthium repeliram os adultos do caruncho e causaram redução do número de insetos emergidos. Os preparados homeopáticos, bem como os extratos alcoólicos não repeliram os adultos do caruncho, porém reduziram a progênie deste inseto. As folhas de R. graveolens não repeliram o caruncho nem afetaram a progênie. Dependente da forma de preparo e utilização, os tratamentos homeopáticos e fitoterápicos, quando misturados aos grãos de feijão, são capazes de afetar o comportamento de A. obtectusThe cultivation of beans in Brazil {{is typical of}} small properties, where part of the production is directed for the <b>commercialization,</b> and <b>part</b> is stored for the family consumption or used as seed. During the storage, the bean grains are subject to losses due to the attack of the bean weevil Acanthoscelides obtectus Say (Coleoptera: Bruchidae), which may cause great damages, endangering its quality, direct and indirectly. Experiments were conducted {{with the objective of}} evaluating the effect of homeopathic and phytoterapic preparations in the management of A. obtectus. Such experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the treatments on the mortality and repellency of adults, and its effect on the emerged progeny. Bioassay with extracts of Rosmarinus officinalis, Ruta graveolens and Artemisia absinthium, and the homeopathic preparations Taraxacum, Chenopodium anthelminticum, macerated bioteraphic and triturated bioteraphic of A. obtectus were conducted in the Laboratory of Homeopathy and Vegetable Health. 3 mL of the treatment for 100 g of bean were used, while for the bioassay with whole green leaves, milled green, whole dry and milled dry leaves of R. officinalis, R. graveolens and A. absinthium, 0, 3 g for 10 g of bean were used. The mortality bioassay was conducted in a completely randomized design, with the phytoterapic treatments, for which 20 g of treated bean were placed in a plate of Petri, where 20 adults of A. obtectus were introduced with up to 24 hours. The evaluations consisted of the counting and retreat of the dead insects for 10 days. The analyzed plates were closed and stored until they completed 45 days, the date when the number of emerged insects was counted. The treatments with the leaves of R. graveolens and A. absinthium presented effect on the mortality of adults, while the treatments with the alcoholic extracts of the three species and the leaves of R. officinalis did not cause mortality of adults, and none of the treatments affected the emerged progeny significantly. The repellency bioassay was conducted in a completely randomized blocks design, in boxes of multiple choice, in which portions were distributed with treated bean in circular form, in which 200 adults of A. obtectus were liberated with age up to 24 hours. The counting of the present insects in each treatment began after 12 hours of the assembly, extending for 10 consecutive days. After this period, the insects were removed, and the plates were closed and stored for 35 days, to accomplish the counting of the emerged progeny. The mill leaves of R. officinalis and green leaves of A. absinthium repelled the adults of the bean weevil and they caused reduction of the number of emerged insects. The homeopathic preparations, as well as the alcoholic extracts did not repel the adults of the bean weevil, even so they reduced the progeny of this insect. The leaves of R. graveolens did not repel the bean weevil nor affected the progeny. Depending on the way of preparing and using, the homeopathic and phytoterapic preparations, when mixed to the bean grains, are capable of affecting the behavior of A. obtectu...|$|R
