40|$|Two oral {{fluoropyrimidine}} therapies {{have been}} introduced for metastatic colorectal cancer. One is a 5 -fluorouracil pro-drug, capecitabine; {{the other is a}} combination of tegafur and uracil administered together with leucovorin. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these oral therapies against standard intravenous 5 -fluorouracil regimens. A systematic literature review was conducted to assess the clinical effectiveness of the therapies and costs were calculated from the UK National Health Service perspective for drug acquisition, drug administration, and the treatment of adverse events. A <b>cost-minimisation</b> <b>analysis</b> was used; this assumes that the treatments are of equal efficacy, although direct randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparisons of the oral therapies with infusional 5 -fluorouracil schedules were not available. The <b>cost-minimisation</b> <b>analysis</b> showed that treatment costs for a 12 -week course of capecitabine (£ 2132) and tegafur with uracil (£ 3385) were lower than costs for the intravenous Mayo regimen (£ 3593) and infusional regimens on the de Gramont (£ 6255) and Modified de Gramont (£ 3485) schedules over the same treatment period.

40|$|Aims To {{evaluate}} costs {{between a}} rate and rhythm control strategy in persistent atrial. fibrillation. Methods and results In a prospective substudy of RACE (Rate control versus electrical cardioversion for persistent atrial. fibrillation) in 428 {{of the total}} 522 patients (206 rate control and 222 rhythm control), a <b>cost-minimisation</b> and cost-effectiveness <b>analysis</b> was performed to assess cost-effectiveness of the treatment strategies. After a mean follow-up of 2. 3 +/- 0. 6 years, the primary endpoint (cardiovascular morbidity and mortality) occurred in 17. 5 % (36 / 202) of the rate control patients and in 21. 2 % (47 / 222) of the rhythm control patients. Mean costs per patient under rate control were EURO 7386 and EURO 8284 under rhythm control. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed that per avoided endpoint under rate control, the cost savings were EURO 24944. Under rhythm control, more costs were generated due to electrical cardioversions, hospital admissions and anti-arrhythmic medication. Costs were higher in older patients, patients with underlying heart disease, those who reached a primary endpoint and women. Heart rhythm {{at the end of}} study, did not influence costs. Conclusions Rate control is more cost-effective than rhythm control for treatment of persistent atrial. fibrillation. Underlying heart disease but not heart rhythm largely accounts for costs.

40|$|AbstractAim: Evaluate {{costs and}} {{benefits}} of erlotinib as 2 nd or 3 rd line treatment of advanced or metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) versus docetaxel, pemetrexed and best supportive care. Materials and methods: <b>Cost-minimisation</b> and cost-utility <b>analysis</b> were performed. Time horizon of two years. Portuguese National Health System (NHS) perspective was applied. Survival and time to progression were obtained from three clinical trials. Base-case analysis: 2 nd or 3 rd line patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) were obtained from a UK study. Resource consumption was estimated by a Portuguese panel of experts. Costs were calculated according to official Portuguese databases (updated to 2008). Only direct health costs were applied. Annual discount rate: 5 %. Sensitivity analysis included different subpopulations, a three year time horizon and a probabilistic analysis. Results: The cost per patient was lower with erlotinib (€ 26 478) than docetaxel (€ 29 262) or pemetrexed (€ 32 762) and higher than best supportive care (€ 16 112). QALYs per patient were higher with erlotinib (0. 250) than docetaxel (0. 225), pemetrexed (0. 241) or best supportive care (0. 186). Erlotinib was dominant in the cost-utility analysis, with a lower cost and a higher efficacy than docetaxel and pemetrexed. The sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the base-case analysis results. Conclusions: The use of erlotinib instead of docetaxel or pemetrexed could contribute to annual savings for the NHS (substitution rates: 5 %- 65 %) ranging from € 135 046 -€ 1 755 602 (docetaxel replacement) and € 291 801 -€ 3 793 409 (pemetrexed replacement), with a gain in terms of QALYs.

40|$|Abstract Background Paediatric ENT {{services}} in regional areas {{can be provided}} through telemedicine (tele-ENT) using videoconferencing or with a conventional outpatient department ENT service (OPD-ENT) in which patients travel to see the specialist. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify the least-cost approach to providing ENT services for paediatric outpatients. Methods A <b>cost-minimisation</b> <b>analysis</b> was conducted comparing the annual costs of the two modes of service provided by the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) in Brisbane. Activity records were reviewed to analyse volume of activity during a 12 month period in 2005, i. e. number of clinics, duration of clinics, number of consultations via telemedicine and in outpatient clinics, diagnoses, and travel related information. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using factors where there was some uncertainty or potential future variation. Results During the study period, 88 ENT consultations were conducted via videoconference for 70 patients at Bundaberg Base Hospital. 177 ENT consultations were conducted at the RCH for 117 patients who had travelled from the Bundaberg region to Brisbane. The variable cost of providing the tele-ENT service was A$ 108 per consultation, compared with A$ 155 per consultation for the conventional outpatient service. Telemedicine was cheaper when the workload exceeded 100 consultations per year. If all 265 consultations were conducted as tele-ENT consultations, the cost-savings would be $ 7, 621. Conclusion The <b>cost-minimisation</b> <b>analysis</b> demonstrated that under the circumstances described in this paper, the tele-ENT service was a more economical method for the health department of providing specialist ENT services. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the paper}} is {{to carry out a}} <b>cost-minimisation</b> <b>analysis</b> in order to measure the cost saving {{performances}} of teleconsultation in Guiana. A prospective analysis lasting 6 months of all admissions for three pathologies (cardiology, parasitology, dermatology) at four care stations in Guiana (Saint Georges, Trois Sauts, Maripasoula and Anticum pata). A <b>cost-minimisation</b> <b>analysis</b> is carried out to compare teleconsultation with air medical evacuations. Fixed and variable costs are estimated in order to identify the break-even point of teleconsultation. Estimations are done at two levels: aggregate level where the four stations are considered jointly, and disaggregate level where these stations are assumed to be separable. It also takes into account organisational and quality effects. If the four stations are considered jointly, the break-even point is 12. 67 (Investments are assumed to last 6 years). This means that teleconsultation permits savings on air medical evacuation costs if thirteen evacuations are avoided each year inseparably at the four stations. We deduce a reference threshold for each station whose value is 3. 17. If stations are analysed separately, the most efficient station is Trois Sauts with the lowest break-even point, 2. 98. Saint Georges is the worst, 4. 31, and suffers from organisational problems caused by personnel turnover which inflate costs of teleconsultation by about 35. 96 %. Our main question is whether teleconsultation is cost saving and our response is based on the comparison of break-event points with the number of air medical evacuations actually avoided during the period. At the aggregate level of the four stations, teleconsultation is not cost saving as only three evacuations were actually prevented. However, these evacuations were avoided in Trois Sauts. Regarding its break-even point, 2. 98, we note that teleconsultation is already a promising option and permits savings...|$|E

40|$|Clinical {{trials have}} {{demonstrated}} {{that the risk of}} developing atopic dermatitis is reduced when using hydrolysed formulas to feed infants with a documented risk of atopy (i. e. an affected parent and/or sibling) when breastfeeding is not practised. However, {{little is known about the}} cost-effectiveness of using hydrolysed formulas. Consequently, economic analyses in 5 European countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Spain and Switzerland) have evaluated the costs and cost-effectiveness of a specific brand of 100 % whey-based partially hydrolysed infant formula, NAN-HA® (PHF-W) compared with a cow's milk standard formula (SF) in the prevention of atopic dermatitis in at-risk children. This review synthesises the findings of these studies. Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) used a decision-analytic model to determine treatment pathways, resource utilisation and costs associated with the management of atopic dermatitis in healthy at-risk newborns who were not exclusively breastfed. The model had a 12 -month horizon and applied reimbursement rates of 60 - 100 % depending on the country. Outcomes were considered from the perspective of the public healthcare system (e. g. the Ministry of Health; MOH), family and society. The final outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per avoided case of atopic dermatitis (ICER) for PHF-W versus SF. A <b>cost-minimisation</b> <b>analysis</b> was also performed to compare PHF-W with extensively hydrolysed formulas (EHF). The base-case CEA produced ICERs per avoided case for PHF-W versus SF of EUR 982 - 1, 343 (MOH perspective), EUR - 2, 202 to - 624 (family perspective) indicating savings, and EUR - 1, 220 to 719 from the societal perspective. The main costs related to formula (MOH and society) and time loss (family). In the <b>cost-minimisation</b> <b>analysis,</b> PHF-W yielded savings of between EUR 4. 3 and 120 million compared with EHF-whey when the latter was used in prevention.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} cost-saving measures in the treatment of patients with conditions requiring proton pump inhibitor (PPI) maintenance therapy, and to examine factors that contribute to inappropriate PPI prescribing. Methods: <b>Cost-Minimisation</b> <b>Analysis</b> was used as the method of pharmacoeconomic evaluation for this study, an appropriate method given the National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidelines from July 2000, which concluded that all five PPIs on the market have equal efficacy. Results: Despite its higher cost, the original PPI omeprazole (Losec®) is still the most frequently prescribed PPI. In PPI maintenance therapy, substitution with any generic form of omeprazole (Losamel, Ulcid, Lopraz, or Losepine) is more cost-effective than using the brand-name omeprazole. Furthermore, in prescribing maintenance therapy for specific indications such as GORD, duodenal ulcer, and NSAID-induced peptic ulcer, rabeprazole (Pariet), lansoprazole (Zoton), or pantoprazole (Protium), respectively, are more cost-effective options compared with brand-name omeprazole.

40|$|Background: Potential {{differences}} in toxicity, potency and acquisition price among the liposomal amphotericin B formulations makes it unclear which agent is less costly when total resource consumption and treatment-associated costs are considered. Design: A retrospective <b>cost-minimisation</b> <b>analysis</b> in 51 patients {{was performed to}} compare the cost of amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC) and liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) from the hospital perspective. Costs ($US, 2001 values) were divided into level I (acquisition price only), level II (costs of all associated treatment, i. e. adverse events, failures, etc.) and level III (total fungal-related hospitalisation) costs. Results: No significant {{differences in}} patient demographics or length of therapy were apparent among those receiving ABLC or L-AMB. The clinical success rate in this population was similar between ABLC and L-AMB (53 % vs 60 %, p = 0. 68), thus justifying {{the use of a}} <b>cost-minimisation</b> <b>analysis.</b> Among patients with baseline elevations in serum creatinine, 47 % receiving ABLC and 10 % receiving L-AMB experienced further increases in serum creatinine (p = 0. 025). No differences in total treatment costs (level I, II, or III) were evident between patients receiving ABLC or L-AMB. When adjusted for duration of therapy, however, costs were significantly lower for ABLC than for L-AMB (level I: ABLC $US 340 versus L-AMB $US 435, p = 0. 002; level II: ABLC $US 361 versus L-AMB $US 454, p = 0. 027). The costs attributable to the prevention or treatment of adverse events were not different between the two treatments, and the economic outcome in this analysis was highly sensitive to the acquisition price and dosage of the lipid antifungal formulation. Two-way sensitivity analysis revealed {{that as long as the}} milligram price of L-AMB was greater than 135 % of the milligram price of ABLC, ABLC remained the less costly formulation. Conclusion: In this patient population, total hospitalisation costs were not different between lipid antifungal formulations. However, after controlling for duration of therapy, ABLC was less costly than L-AMB, when considering acquisition costs of the lipid antifungal agent and costs associated with concomitant antifungal therapy and the treatment of adverse events or lipid failures, indicating that the acquisition price of these agents should be predictive of their cost differences.

40|$|We aim to {{establish}} {{whether it is}} ever appropriate to conduct <b>cost-minimisation</b> <b>analysis</b> (CMA) rather than cost-effectiveness analysis. We perform a literature review to examine how the use of CMA has changed since Briggs and O'Brien announced its death in 2001. Examples of simulated and trial data are presented: firstly to illustrate {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of CMA in the context of non-inferiority trials and those finding no significant difference in efficacy and secondly to assess whether CMA gives biased results. We show that CMA is still used and will bias measures of uncertainty, causing overestimation or underestimation of the value of information and the probability that treatment is cost-effective. Although bias will be negligible for non-inferiority studies comparing treatments that differ enormously in cost, it is generally necessary to collect and analyse data on costs and efficacy (including utilities) to assess this bias. Cost-effectiveness analysis (including evaluation of the joint distribution of costs and benefits) is almost always required to avoid biased estimation of uncertainty. The remit of CMA in trial-based economic evaluation is therefore even narrower than previously thought, suggesting that CMA is not only dead but should also be buried.

40|$|Objectives: To elicit actual {{clinical}} practice of treating {{intensive care unit}} patients with catheter-related infections with teicoplanin or vancomycin from a hospital perspective. As clinical trials have demonstrated similar efficacy of these glycopeptides, a <b>cost-minimisation</b> <b>analysis</b> was also carried out. Methods: The Delphi survey technique was used to gather the opinion of nine physicians regarding resource utilization associated with teicoplanin and vancomycin. Treatment costs considered were costs of drug acquisition, costs of material and nursing time required for drug preparation and administration, and costs of laboratory tests. Results: Physicians tend to administer higher loading doses of teicoplanin than recommended in the drug information leaflet. Even though evidence {{of the effectiveness of}} vancomycin is mainly derived from trials using multiple-daily administration schedules, five physicians administered it on a once-daily basis. Mean treatment costs amounted to 1, 272 € with teicoplanin and 1, 041 € with vancomycin. Higher treatment costs with teicoplanin arose from more elevated drug acquisition costs (1, 076 € versus 795 €). Treatment with vancomycin was associated with higher costs of laboratory tests as a result of more frequent monitoring of serum concentrations (217 € versus 150 €). Conclusions: This analysis of {{clinical practice}} and costs indicated that the resource utilisation advantages from fewer laboratory tests with teicoplanin partially offset higher drug acquisition costs. In addition to efficacy and costs, other factors such as route of administration, patient profile and adverse effects need to inform the choice between teicoplanin and vancomycin...|$|E
40|$|Background: Integrated {{care has}} emerged {{in a variety of}} forms in industrialised {{countries}} during the past decade. It is generally assumed that these new arrangements result in increased effectiveness and quality of care, while being cost-effective or even costsaving at the same time. However, systematic evaluation, including an evaluation of the relative costs and benefits of these arrangements, has largely been lacking. Objectives: To stimulate fruitful dialogue and debate about the need for economic evaluation in integrated care, and to outline possibilities for undertaking economic appraisal studies in this relatively new field. Theory: Key concepts, including e. g. scarcity and opportunity costs, are introduced, followed by a brief overview of the most common methods used in economic evaluation of health care programmes. Then a number of issues that seem particularly relevant for economic evaluation of integrated care arrangements are addressed in more detail, illustrated with examples from the literature. Conclusion and discussion: There is a need for well-designed economic evaluation studies of integrated care arrangements, in particular in order to support decision making on the long-term financing of these programmes. Although relatively few studies have been done to date, the field is challenging from a methodological point of view, offering analysts a wealth of opportunities. Guidance to realise these opportunities is provided by the general principles for economic evaluation, which can be tailored to the requirements of this particular field.

40|$|Background: Two randomised, {{controlled}} trials (n = 1396) comparing (i) intravenous fluorouracil (FU) plus oral {{folinic acid}} (leucovorin) and (ii) oral tegafur plus uracil (UFT) plus folinic acid {{for the treatment}} of metastatic colorectal carcinoma found both regimens to have equivalent efficacy in terms of survival, tumour response and time to disease progression. The UFT/folinic acid regimen was associated with a better toxicity profile than FU/folinic acid. Objective: To determine the comparative frequencies and costs of healthcare resources utilised in the treatment of patients with these two regimens from a hospital and government perspective. Design: A <b>cost-minimisation</b> <b>analysis</b> of a subgroup of patients from the trials (n = 154) was conducted. Costs considered included those for hospital admissions, outpatient clinics, laboratories, imaging modalities, other diagnostic procedures, physician resources, other health professionals, other procedures such as surgery and transfusion, and concomitant medications. The cost of study medications {{was not included in the}} analysis. The endpoint was a total average cost per patient per treatment and per cycle. Results: Patients on the oral UFT regimen had fewer outpatient clinic visits and used fewer laboratory resources than patients treated with FU. However, those on the oral regimen had more days of hospitalisation than the patients treated with the intravenous regimen. Patients treated with UFT used 21 % less concomitant medication; however, in both groups these medications accounted for a similar percentage compared with the total costs of the treatment.

We performed an economic evaluation alongside one of these trials to assess the cost consequences of the outpatient management strategy. Data were collected through case record forms, complemented by a prospective questionnaire in 78 consecutive patients, interviews with health care providers, and hospital data bases. Our study demonstrated that seventy-five percent of patients allocated to low-molecular-weight heparin received treatment either entirely at home or after a brief hospital stay. Fifteen percent of these patients required professional domiciliary care. Within-centre comparisons of resource utilisation in terms of natural units showed that outpatient management with low-molecular-weight heparin reduced the average number of hospital days in the initial treatment period in nine centres by 59 percent (95 % CI: 43 to 71 percent) accompanied by a limited increase in outpatient and professional domiciliary care. The average reduction in hospital days at the end of follow up was 40 percent (95 % CI: 25 to 54 percent).

Methods: This study compares two methods of oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) monitoring: traditional prothrombin time measurement and self-measuring or self-regulation by the patient. As numerous published studies indicate that the two methods are equally effective (while underlining significant deviations in the frequency of complications), a <b>cost-minimisation</b> <b>analysis</b> was applied. The methodology was based on the consensus of experts from different geographical regions and health service sets. All costs and benefits attributable to patient treatment were examined and analysed {{from the perspective of the}} Greek National Health System (NHS). Results: From the analysis it was estimated that the savings from the use of self-monitoring could reach, is an element of 6, 1 32, 750 at market prices for a five-year period. The potential economic benefit from the expansion of self-monitoring to all eligible patients was equal to approximately 10 % of the total treatment cost of the entire patient population under OAT in Greece. In addition, the social benefits resulting from higher prevention rates of possible complications, as well as the improvement in patients' quality of life should not be underestimated. The total reduction in private expenditure deriving from the expansion of self-monitoring was estimated at is an element of 3, 096, 000, while savings for the NHS were estimated at is an element of 2, 473, 317 over a five-year period. Conclusions: The benefit to the healthcare system from the use of self-monitoring is significant, and the further use of this technology could contribute to the rational allocation of healthcare resources...|$|E
40|$|Non-small cell {{lung cancer}} (NSCLC) {{is the most}} common type of lung cancer and its medical and {{economical}} burden represents a serious matter in Europe and Usa, due to its high mortality rates and drug costs. Lung cancer is responsible for about 30 % of cancer death in men and women; in Europe only about 8 per cent of people with lung cancer survive for 5 years. At present combination chemotherapy based on cisplatin or carboplatin associated with paclitaxel, vinorelbine or gemcitabine is the state of the art for the treatment in patients with stage IIIb or IV NSCLC. Aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of paclitaxel/carboplatin (PCb), gemcitabine/cisplatin (GC) and vinorelbine/cisplatin (VC) in the perspective of the Italian National Health Service. Therefore we perfomed a semi-Markov decision model mainly based on clinical results from the Italian Lung Cancer Project. The model included differential direct medical costs registered for two years from starting chemotherapy, using tariffs valid for 2005. Benefits was measured by years of life saved (YOLs). The model also allowed to estimate only costs accrued over the period of time, performing a <b>cost-minimisation</b> <b>analysis.</b> According to cost-effectiveness analysis, VC is dominated because it’s more costly and less effective than GC. On the contrary, combination chemotherapy with GC is more inexpensive but less effective than paclitaxel/carboplatin (PCb) : in this case we compared the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with a maximum acceptable willingness-to-pay (WTP) value. In the base scenario the ICER of PCb over GC treatment is 52, 326 euro/ YOLs, which is definitely lower than the maximum acceptable WTP value. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results from cost-effectiveness analysis in the base scenario...|$|E
40|$|Background: Not all {{patients}} with Parkinson's disease (PD) respond to levodopa and others develop dyskinesias. Ropinirole, a dopamine agonist, {{is associated with}} fewer dyskinesias than levodopa. Objective: To examine {{the economic impact of}} reducing dyskinesias using ropinirole instead of levodopa plus benserazide in PD was examined. The research question addressed was: is the added cost of ropinirole offset by savings due to avoided cases of dyskinesia? Methods: A <b>cost-minimisation</b> <b>analysis</b> was performed from both the societal and Ministry of Health (MoH) of Ontario, Canada perspectives, using 5 -year data from a study of dyskinesia outcomes comparing ropinirole with levodopa plus benserazide. A predictive model was developed to capture resource utilisation over 5 years, such as medication costs, medical consultations, hospital admissions, nursing home admissions, caregiver time and productivity loss. The model was based on a previously reported clinical trial which determined dyskinesia rates to be 20 % for ropinirole and 45 % for levodopa. Standard costing lists were used, and costs were discounted at various rates. Constant 1999 Canadian dollars ($Can) were applied, and no increases were assumed over the time horizon of the analysis. A multivariate sensitivity analysis with changes in key parameters was also performed. Results: From a societal perspective, ropinirole was cost saving. From the MoH perspective, the analysis yielded an incremental expected daily cost/patient of $Can 4. 41 for substituting levodopa plus benserazide with ropinirole. Ropinirole resulted in daily savings/patient of $Can 0. 17 in non-drug healthcare costs. In the sensitivity analysis, the direction of results did not change despite changes of 15 to 20 % in key parameters, suggesting robustness of the model. Conclusions: From the societal perspective, in comparison with levodopa plus benserazide, the added cost of ropinirole is offset by savings due to avoided cases of dyskinesia.

40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} costs of {{midazolam}} and droperidol {{for the management of}} acute agitation in the emergency department (ED). Method: A decision analysis model was used to undertake a <b>cost-minimisation</b> <b>analysis</b> of resource utilisation in the ED of a Melbourne hospital. Data from acutely agitated patients who received midazolam (n = 74) or droperidol (n = 79) in a randomised clinical trial (February 2002 to April 2004) were reviewed. Results: All direct medical and non-medical costs relating to the management of acute agitation in the ED were analysed. The average cost scenario was estimated for the 2 treatments. The model simulated 9 possible outcomes based on whether patients were 'sedated' or 'not sedated' and whether they required 're-dosing' or 'no re-dosing'. Hospitalisation cost incorporated multiple items as part of the average cost per service code for the ED length of stay. In the base case analysis, midazolam was associated with notably less overall drug costs (A$ 3. 05 vs A$ 21. 10), which contributed to less total treatment costs. The 'expected' median ED length of stay was marginally longer in the midazolam group (12 vs 11. 8 hours), resulting in slightly higher hospitalisation costs (A$ 1370 vs A$ 1361). The midazolam group incurred higher median costs for pathology (A$ 78. 60 vs A$ 61. 60) and imaging (A$ 5. 25 vs A$ 0. 60). The cost of electrocardiograms was similar (A$ 27. 10 vs A$ 28). With a cost advantage of A$ 59 per patient, midazolam was 3. 8 % less costly than droperidol (A$ 1496 vs A$ 1555). Conclusion: Midazolam was marginally more cost saving than droperidol when used to manage acute agitation in the ED. Several challenges were identified that need to be overcome to enable future robust pharmacoeconomic studies. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Acute {{paracetamol}} poisoning is {{a rapidly}} increasing problem in Sri Lanka. The antidotes are expensive and yet no health economic evaluation {{has been done}} on the therapy for acute paracetamol poisoning in the developing world. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the cost effectiveness of using N-acetylcysteine over methionine in the management of acute paracetamol poisoning in Sri Lanka. Methods Economic analysis was applied using public healthcare system payer perspective. Costs were obtained from a series of patients admitted to the National Hospital of Sri Lanka with a history of acute paracetamol overdose. Evidence on effectiveness was obtained from a systematic review of the literature. Death due to hepatotoxicity was used as the primary outcome of interest. Analysis and development of decision tree models was done using Tree Age Pro 2008. Results An affordable treatment threshold of Sri Lankan rupees 1, 537, 120 /death prevented was set from the expected years of productive life gained and the average contribution to GDP. A <b>cost-minimisation</b> <b>analysis</b> was appropriate for patients presenting within 10 hours and methionine was the least costly antidote. For patients presenting 10 - 24 hours after poisoning, n-acetylcysteine was more effective and the incremental cost effectiveness ratio of Sri Lankan rupees 316, 182 /life saved was well under the threshold. One-way and multi-way sensitivity analysis also supported methionine for patients treated within 10 hours and n-acetylcysteine for patients treated within 10 - 24 hours as preferred antidotes. Conclusions Post ingestion time is an important determinant of preferred antidotal therapy for acute paracetamol poisoning patients in Sri Lanka. Using n-acetylcysteine in all patients is not cost effective. On economic grounds, methionine should become the preferred antidote for Sri Lankan patients treated within 10 hours of the acute ingestion and n-acetylcysteine should continue to be given to patients treated within 10 - 24 hours. </p...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundIndacaterol/glycopyrronium (IND/GLY) is a once-daily inhaled fixed-dose {{combination}} of indacaterol (IND), a long-acting β 2 -adrenergic agonist (LABA), and glycopyrronium (GLY), a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) {{for use as}} maintenance treatment to relieve symptoms of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) in adults. ObjectiveTo determine the economic benefits of IND/GLY compared with the free combination of indacaterol and glycopyrronium (IND + GLY), and with the {{fixed-dose combination}} of salmeterol/fluticasone (SFC), in a moderate-to-severe COPD population with low-exacerbation risk. The model-based analysis extrapolated results up to lifetime time horizon and calculated costs per quality-adjusted life year. MethodsAssuming equal efficacy, a <b>cost-minimisation</b> <b>analysis</b> compared IND/GLY vs IND + GLY using model inputs from the double-blind, randomised SHINE trial. The double-blind, randomised ILLUMINATE and TORCH trials were used to analyse cost-effectiveness versus SFC. To consider ICS-related pneumonia events, published odds ratio comparing an ICS-exposed group to a control group of COPD patients was used. Direct and indirect drug costs as well as drug acquisition costs (in Swedish Krona [SEK]) were derived from published Swedish sources. Cost and effects were discounted with 3 %. Uncertainty was assessed by one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA). ResultsIND/GLY was cost-saving vs IND + GLY with incremental savings of SEK (EUR) 768 (85), and 3309 (368) per patient over one and five years. IND/GLY was found to be less costly and more effective compared to SFC with cost savings of SEK (EUR) 2744 (303), 8854 (976), 13, 938 (1536), 27, 495 (3031) and 43, 033 (4744) over one, three, five, ten years and lifetime. The PSA indicated that all iterations produced dominant results for IND/GLY. ConclusionIND/GLY is cost-minimising vs IND + GLY and dominates SFC in the maintenance treatment of COPD patients in Sweden. Encouraging dual bronchodilator therapy over an ICS-containing combination results in lower total costs and better outcomes compared to combination therapy including fluticasone in moderate-to-severe COPD patients with low exacerbation risk...|$|E
40|$|Aims (1) To {{evaluate}} various predictors for {{a higher}} diagnostic yield in bronchoscopy (2) To evaluate different combinations of sampling techniques in bronchoscopy of endobronchial visible lesions and peripheral lesions not visible by bronchoscopy (3) To evaluate endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) with a rotating miniprobe for localisation of peripheral lesions in a real-life situation among pulmonologists at various levels of expertise Methods I: A retrospective cohort study evaluated the results in the study centre before the introduction of EBUS. The study searched for predictors of a higher diagnostic yield and evaluated different combinations of sampling techniques. All 1438 bronchoscopies performed in 2003 and 2004 at Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway, were retrospectively reviewed and 363 patients with proven malignant lung disease {{were included in the}} study. Sex, age, endobronchial visibility, location (lobe), distance from the carina and tumour size were evaluated as possible predictors {{for a higher}} detection rate for cancer. Sampling techniques performed were biopsy, transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA), brushing, small volume lavage (SVL), and aspiration of fluid from the entire procedure. The predictors of a higher detection rate were analysed in bivariate analyses and in multivariate logistic regression. McNemars test compared different combinations of sampling techniques. A <b>cost-minimisation</b> <b>analysis</b> evaluated different combinations of sampling techniques for visible lesions. II: A prospective open randomised trial evaluated EBUS for peripheral lesions and searched for the optimal combination of sampling techniques in peripheral lesions. The study period was from 2005 to 2008 at Haukeland University Hospital and 7 Aalesund Hospital, Norway. The included 264 patients had peripheral lesions on the CT scan and no obvious endobronchial visible tumour on bronchoscopy. A simple randomisation without stratification assigned the patients to either EBUS or conventional bronchoscopy without EBUS. EBUS was performed with a 1. 7 mm rotating probe with guide sheath. The study protocol recommended fluoroscopy for both study arms. An intention-to-treat analysis evaluated EBUS and a multivariate analysis was performed to avoid confounding. A cost-effectiveness analysis evaluated different combinations of biopsy, brushing, TBNA and washing. Results The detection rate for cancer in the retrospective study was 17 % in patients with no endobronchial visible lesions, 34 % in patients with endobronchial constriction or compression and 77 % in patients with endobronchial visible lesions. The multivariate logistic regression analysis retained endobronchial visibility and size as significantly predictors of a higher detection rate for cancer. Biopsy and brushing combined with endobronchial needle aspiration (EBNA) was the most economical combination of sampling techniques for endobronchial lesions in a <b>cost-minimisation</b> <b>analysis.</b> The detection rate for cancer in the prospective study was 36 % in the EBUS group and 44 % in the non-EBUS group (ns). The prospective study included only patients without endobronchial visible lesions. There was a significant interaction between size and randomisation to EBUS. Patients with lesions below 3 cm had a significantly higher detection rate in the non-EBUS group. Lesions visualised by EBUS had a higher detection rate for cancer than lesions not visualised by EBUS (62 % vs. 19 %, p< 0. 01). The cost of one additional positive sample was 1211 euro when brushing was added to biopsy. Based on a willingness to pay of 2800 euro for an additional positive sample, biopsy and brushing was the most cost-effective combination of sampling techniques for lesions not visible by bronchoscopy. The addition of TBNA or washing had cost-effectiveness ratios above 2800 euro. 8 Conclusions 1) Endobronchial visibility and lesion size were significant predictors of a higher detection rate for cancer in bronchoscopy. 2) For visible lesions, biopsy and brushing combined with EBNA was the most economical combination of sampling techniques. For lesions not visible by bronchoscopy, biopsy together with brushing was the most cost-effective combination of sampling techniques. 3) Overall, EBUS did not increase the detection rate for cancer in peripheral lesions when pulmonologists at various levels of expertise performed the bronchoscopies. However, visualisation by EBUS predicted a high detection rate for cancer...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Scientific {{evidence}} for the frequency of monitoring of type 2 diabetes patients is lacking. If three-monthly control in general practice could be reduced to six-monthly control in some patients, this would {{on the one hand}} reduce the use of medical services including involvement of practice nurses, and thus reduce costs, {{and on the other hand}} alleviate the burden of people with type 2 diabetes. The goal of this study is to make primary diabetes care as efficient as possible for patients and health care providers. Therefore, we want to determine whether six-monthly monitoring of well-controlled type 2 diabetes patients in primary care leads to equivalent cardiometabolic control compared to the generally recommended three-monthly monitoring. Methods and design The study is a randomised controlled patient-preference equivalence trial. Participants are asked if they prefer three-monthly (usual care) or six-monthly diabetes monitoring. If they do not have a preference, they are randomised to a three-monthly or six-monthly monitoring group. Patients are eligible for the study if they are between 40 and 80 years old, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes more than one year ago, treated by a general practitioner, not on insulin treatment, and with HbA 1 c ≤ 7. 5 %, systolic blood pressure ≤ 145 mmHg and total cholesterol ≤ 5. 2 mmol/l. The intervention group (six-monthly monitoring) will receive the same treatment with the same treatment targets as the control group (three-monthly monitoring). The intervention period will last one and a half year. After the intervention, the three-monthly and six-monthly monitoring groups are compared on equivalence of cardiometabolic control. Secondary outcome measures are HbA 1 c, blood pressure, cholesterol level, Body Mass Index, smoking behaviour, physical activity, loss of work due to illness, health status, diabetes-specific distress, satisfaction with treatment and adherence to medications. We will use intention-to-treat analysis with repeated measures. For outcomes that have only baseline and final measurements, we will use ANCOVA. Depending on the results, a <b>cost-minimisation</b> <b>analysis</b> or an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis will be done. Discussion This study will provide valuable information on the most efficient control frequency of well-controlled type 2 diabetes patients in primary care.

40|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} among the most common {{malignancies}} in developed countries. Screening can reduce mortality significantly, although the most appropriate method is still under debate. Observational studies have revealed that lifestyle measures may also be beneficial for prevention of colorectal cancer. Surgery is still the most effective treatment modality for colorectal cancer. The survival benefits of chemotherapy are only modest. For nearly 5 decades, 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) has been the main cytotoxic agent for treatment of colorectal cancer. In the last decade, the new cytotoxic agents raltitrexed, irinotecan and oxaliplatin have been introduced, next to the oral 5 -FU analogues capecitabine and tegafur in combination with uracil (UFT). Moreover, the immunotherapeutics bevacizumab and cetuximab have become approved for treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. The economic implications of colorectal cancer treatment are substantial. The costs of treatment are mainly attributable to the early and terminal stage of the disease (i. e. surgery, hospitalisation, chemo- and immunotherapy and supportive care). The introduction of new chemo- and immunotherapeutics has caused a continuing increase of treatment expenditures. Therefore, comparative costs and cost effectiveness are important for assessing the value of new treatment regimens. The available study results suggest that addition of irinotecan or oxaliplatin to 5 -FU/folinic acid dosage regimens is cost effective. Also, capecitabine is calculated to be cost effective when compared with 5 -FU/folinic acid. For UFT, no comparative studies of cost effectiveness were found. Since raltitrexed and 5 -FU/ folinic acid have shown equal efficacy in terms of survival, cost-effectiveness analysis is considered not to be applicable and <b>cost-minimisation</b> <b>analysis</b> may be sufficient. At present, pharmacoeconomic analyses of combination treatment with the immunotherapeutics bevacizumab or cetuximab are not available, except for recent cost-effectiveness considerations by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence with negative recommendations for both agents in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Given the high treatment costs, substantial toxicity and relatively limited efficacy of the fast changing chemo- and immunotherapeutic combinations for colorectal cancer, examination of cost-effectiveness studies should be conducted on a routine basis along with determination of clinical benefits...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Compared to {{conventional}} human basal insulin (neutral protamine Hagedorn; NPH) the long-acting analogue insulin glargine (GLA) {{is associated with}} a number of advantages regarding metabolic control, hypoglycaemic events and convenience. However, the unit costs of GLA exceed those of NPH. This study aims to systematically review the economic evidence comparing GLA with NPH in basal-bolus treatment (intensified conventional therapy; ICT) of type 1 diabetes in order to facilitate informed decision making in clinical practice and health policy. Methods A systematic literature search was performed for the period of January 1 st 2000 to December 1 st 2009 via Embase, Medline, the Cochrane Library, the databases GMS (German Medical Science) and DAHTA (Deutsche Agentur für Health Technology Assessment), and the abstract books of relevant international scientific congresses. Retrieved studies were reviewed based on predefined inclusion criteria, methodological and quality aspects. In order to allow comparison between studies, currencies were converted using purchasing power parities (PPP). Results A total of 7 health economic evaluations from 4 different countries fulfilled the predefined criteria: 6 modelling studies, all of them cost-utility analyses, and one claims data analysis with a cost-minimisation design. One cost-utility analysis showed dominance of GLA over NPH. The other 5 cost-utility analyses resulted in additional costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained for GLA, ranging from € 3, 859 to € 57, 002 (incremental cost effectiveness ratio; ICER). The <b>cost-minimisation</b> <b>analysis</b> revealed lower annual diabetes-specific costs in favour of NPH {{from the perspective of the}} German Statutory Health Insurance (SHI). Conclusions The incremental cost-utility-ratios (ICER) show favourable values for GLA with considerable variation. If a willingness-to-pay threshold of £ 30, 000 (National Institute of Clinical Excellence, UK) is adopted, GLA is cost-effective in 4 of 6 cost utility analyses (CUA) included. Thus insulin glargine (GLA) seems to offer good value for money. Comparability between studies is limited because of methodological and country specific aspects. The results of this review underline that evaluation of insulin therapy should use evidence on efficacy of therapy from information synthesis. The concept of relating utility decrements to fear of hypoglycaemia is a plausible approach but needs further investigation. Also future evaluations of basal-bolus insulin therapy should include costs of consumables such as needles for insulin injection as well as test strips and lancets for blood glucose self monitoring. </p...|$|E
