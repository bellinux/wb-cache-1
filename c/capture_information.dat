25|$|Knowledge-representation is {{the field}} of {{artificial}} intelligence that focuses on designing computer representations that <b>capture</b> <b>information</b> about the world {{that can be used}} to solve complex problems. The justification for knowledge representation is that conventional procedural code is not the best formalism to use to solve complex problems. Knowledge representation makes complex software easier to define and maintain than procedural code and can be used in expert systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{source of}} the data {{discussed}} above is the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI), a program managed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) with data provided by state agencies. CFOI is the most comprehensive surveillance system for work-related injury fatalities in the U.S. Multiple data sources are accessed to compile data, including death certificates, OSHA reports, workers’ compensation reports, police reports, and media accounts. Cases are deemed to be work-related upon confirmation by two independent data sources. CFOI combines strong methods for case ascertainment with detailed information on worker demographics and company characteristics. However, because CFOI must <b>capture</b> <b>information</b> {{on all kinds of}} occupational fatalities, it provides little detail on circumstances and risk factors specific to MVCs.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 September 2011, a new worm was found, {{thought to}} be related to Stuxnet. The Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security (CrySyS) of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics {{analyzed}} the malware, naming the threat Duqu. Symantec, based on this report, continued the analysis of the threat, calling it [...] "nearly identical to Stuxnet, but with a completely different purpose", and published a detailed technical paper. The main component used in Duqu is designed to <b>capture</b> <b>information</b> such as keystrokes and system information. The exfiltrated data may be used to enable a future Stuxnet-like attack. On 28 December 2011, Kaspersky Lab's director of global research and analysis spoke to Reuters about recent research results showing that the platform Stuxnet and Duqu both originated from in 2007, and is being referred to as Tilded due to the ~d {{at the beginning of the}} file names. Also uncovered in this research was the possibility for three more variants based on the Tilded platform.|$|E

It’s good for science: Allows research to be reproduced and verified. Allows data to be found and understood by other researchers. Encourages collaboration and cross-disciplinary work. Maintains the scientific record. It’s good for researchers: Provides attribution and credit for the hard work of creating a dataset. Makes it easier to build in good data management practices. Demonstrates the quality and usefulness of the data (especially for researchers outside the immediate field). <b>Captures</b> <b>information</b> about the data’s impact. It’s good for funders: Reduces money and effort needed to recreate important datasets. Reassures funders that the data resulting from their funding is useful and archived safely. <b>Captures</b> <b>information</b> about the funder’s impact.
