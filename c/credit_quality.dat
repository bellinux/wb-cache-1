The improvement comes from diversification of the bank's assets and capital {{which provides a}} buffer to absorb losses without defaulting on its obligations. However, banknotes and deposits are generally unsecured; if the bank gets into difficulty and pledges assets as security, to raise the funding it needs to continue to operate, this puts the note holders and depositors in an economically subordinated position.|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{marginalization}} {{of women in}} development, particularly in South Asia, has been highlighted in the development literature. Women in this region {{are found to be}} generally poor, lack of education, and have a low quality of life, due to various economic and cultural reasons. Thus, unlocking the potentials of these women appears to be a plausible move as this could improve not only their income, but also their quality of life. One such initiative to unlock the potential of these women is micro credit program, where small loan is given to these women to enable them to embark on economic activities, which consequently improve their household income and quality of life. Indeed, there have been many studies that examine the relationship between micro <b>credit</b> and <b>quality</b> of life, and found that there is a positive relationship between micro <b>credit</b> and <b>quality</b> of life of the borrowers (women). However, most of these studies implicitly assume that the impact of micro <b>credit</b> on <b>quality</b> of life is direct, and hence, did not consider the role of other factors in evaluating the impact of micro <b>credit</b> on <b>quality</b> of life. Here, we argue that, the impact of micro <b>credit</b> on <b>quality</b> of life is not direct, but rather indirect. We believe personal empowerment does {{play an important role in}} influencing the impact of micro <b>credit</b> on <b>quality</b> of life. The mere availability of micro credit, in our view, did not guarantee a positive impact on quality of life. Rather, the availability of credit to borrowers affects their personal confidence, which consequently affects their level of quality of life. This paper discusses the theoretical framework by which these variables – microcredit, personal empowerment and quality of life – are inter-related...|$|R

In other words, they borrow short and lend long.

40|$|An {{enduring}} puzzle is why {{credit rating}} agencies (CRAs) use a few categories to describe <b>credit</b> <b>qualities</b> {{lying in a}} continuum, even when ratings coarseness reduces welfare. We model a cheap-talk game in which a CRA assigns positive weights to the divergent goals of issuing firms and investors. The CRA wishes to inflate ratings, but prefers an unbiased rating to one whose inflation exceeds a threshold. Ratings coarseness arises in equilibrium to preclude excessive rating inflation. We show that competition among CRAs can increase ratings coarseness. We also examine the welfare implications of regulatory initiatives...|$|R

2500|$|This volatility/credit {{dichotomy}} is {{the standard}} practice for valuing convertibles.

Regulations that severely restrict speculation in credit default swap markets could, as a result, increase sovereign borrowing costs. I briefl y suggest alternative regulatory approaches. ...|$|R

[...] Here, has this island of ours, for the greatest part of twenty years, lain under the influence of such counsels and persons, whose principle and interest it was to corrupt our manners, blind our understandings, drain our wealth, and in time destroy our constitution both in Church and State; and we at last were brought to the very brink of ruin; yet by the means of perpetual misrepresentations, {{have never been able to}} distinguish between our enemies and friends. We have seen a great part of the nation's money got into the hands of those, who by their birth, education and merit, could pretend no higher than to wear our liveries; while others,[8] who by their <b>credit,</b> <b>quality</b> and fortune, were only able to give reputation and success to the Revolution, were not only laid aside, as dangerous and useless; but loaden with the scandal of Jacobites, men of arbitrary principles, and pensioners to France; while Truth, who is said to lie in a well, seemed now to be buried there under a heap of stones. But I remember, it was a usual complaint among the Whigs, that the bulk of landed men was not in their interests, which some of the wisest looked on as an ill omen; and we saw it was with the utmost difficulty that they could preserve a majority, while the court and ministry were on their side; till they had learned those admirable expedients for deciding elections, and influencing distant boroughs by powerful motives from the city. But all this was mere force and constraint, however upheld by most dexterous artifice and management: till the people began to apprehend their properties, their religion, and the monarchy itself in danger; then we saw them greedily laying hold on the first occasion to interpose. But of this mighty change in the dispositions of the people, I shall discourse more at large in some following paper; wherein I shall endeavour to undeceive those deluded or deluding persons, who hope or pretend, it is only a short madness in the vulgar, from which they may soon recover.

40|$|The paper aims to {{demonstrate}} that the unprecedented granting of consumer credits to population in recent years, under the circumstances of a spectacular goods supply growth, has adversely affected some consumers, and jeopardized the protection of their life, health and safety.

Data collection and processing has resulted in the filling of a 14 queries questionnaire by each of the 560 consumers in the South-Western Oltenia region and, subsequently, in data analysis.
