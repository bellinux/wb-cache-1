Experiments have been performed using by-products of coal processing (schlamms) from Freyming-France coal mixed with 38 % water. Four distinct steps have been characterized including: water evaporation, devolatilization, volatile combustion and heterogeneous char combustion. A detailed parametric study has been made. The main results are as follows: the duration of heterogeneous combustion {{does not depend on}} the heating power, but surprisingly, this duration is increased when the particle size of droplet constitutive coal decreases. This is attributed either to ash effect or to porosity evolution. Ash does not influence the evaporation and total eterogeneous combustion durations. A computer model has been developed to describe the different steps. The water evaporation and fixed carbon combustion are assumed to be mass diffusion controlled, the combustion following a shrinking core model. Good agreement is obtained between computed and measured parameters...|$|E

40|$|The {{fluidity}} of <b>Coal</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Mixture</b> (CMW) {{is significantly}} lost when CWM is heated over 100 ℃. This Phenomenon has been analyzed experimentally in this work.

It was also observed that there existed a little swelling of coal perticles at 150 ℃～ 200 ℃. Semiquantitative discussion about the effect of swelling on the fluidity of CWM has revealed that the swelling of coal is most likely the reason for the anomarous viscosity increase of CWM at higher temperature range...|$|R

40|$|This {{program is}} being {{conducted}} as a cooperative {{agreement between the}} Consortium for <b>Coal</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Mixture</b> Technology and the U. S. Department of Energy. Activities this reporting period are summarized by phase. Phase I is nearly completed. During this reporting period, coal beneficiation/preparation studies, engineering designs and economics for retrofitting the Crane, Indiana boiler to fire coal-based fuels, and a 1, 000 -hour demonstration of dry, micronized coal were completed. In addition, a demonstration-scale micronized-coal <b>water</b> <b>mixture</b> (MCWM) preparation circuit was constructed and a 1, 000 -hour demonstration firing MCWM began. Work in Phase II focused on emissions reductions, coal beneficiation/preparation studies, and economic analyses of coal use. Emissions reductions investigations involved literature surveys of NO{sub x}, SO{sub 2 }, trace metals, volatile organic compounds, and fine particulate matter capture. In addition, vendors and engineering firms were contacted to identify the appropriate emissions technologies for the installation of commercial NO{sub x} and SO{sub 2 } removal systems on the demonstration boiler. Information from the literature surveys and engineering firms {{will be used to}} identify, design, and install a control system(s). Work continued on the refinement and optimization of coal grinding and MCWM preparation procedures, and on the development of advanced processes for beneficiating high ash, high sulfur coals. Work also continued on determining the basic cost estimation of boiler retrofits, and evaluating environmental, regulatory, and regional economic impacts. In addition, the feasibility of technology adoption, and the public`s perception of the benefits and costs of coal usage was studied. A coal market analysis was completed.

40|$|As is known,the {{presence}} of chemical additives is very effective for producing high <b>coal</b> loading CWM(Coal <b>Water</b> <b>Mixture).</b> To reduce process cost, natural additive of CWM such as Humic-Acid extracted from low rank coal and lignin obtained by concentrating the pulp waste liquor(black liquor) are noted well now. At the same time,the extraction {{process and the}} concentration process deplete a lot of chemical reagent and energy. Further more,the problem of pulp waste liquor disposal or utilization has been attacked from many standpoints, People are still seeking an-economical solution. It was once studied to produce CWM using pulp waste liquor directly, but the dispersing effect only by the lignin contained in the black liquor. Corrosion of black liquor due to its high pH is also a difficult problem for the storage transportation and combustion of CWM. This study attempted to extract low rank coal such as lignite using black liquor,and then,prepare CWM using the extraction liquor directly. It {{was found that the}} viscosity of CWM prepared by lignite black liquor extraction was lower than that of CWM prepared using black liquor directly.

40|$|Measurements of {{transport}} properties of highly loaded coal-water <b>mixture</b> (<b>CWM),</b> such as specific heat, thermal conductivity, and flow curve, are performed {{to investigate the}} characteristics of heat transfer in pipe flow. The specific heat of CWM depends on both the specific heat values of <b>coal</b> and <b>water,</b> and correlates well with the mass fraction of coal. The thermal conductivity, on the other hand, correlates well with the volume fraction of coal and is shown to be expressed well by Maxwell 2 ̆ 7 s equation. Heat transfer experiments are also performed for CWM flowing through a vertical circular pipe to obtain the average heat transfer coefficients. The data are shown in laminar flow and for uniform wall temperature conditions. Through the experiments, pressure drop data are also measured to determine the flow characteristics, i. e., the flow curves. It is shown that the flow behavior of CWM is able to be approximated well by a Bingham plastic fluid model.

Experiments were conducted in southern Arizona to {{study the effects of}} irrigating wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with a <b>mixture</b> of pump <b>water</b> and waste water and with pump water alone on wheat growth, grain yield, grain quality, soil properties, and irrigation water quality. In small plot research, wheat irrigated with the pump water-waste <b>water</b> <b>mixture</b> produced taller plants, more heads per unit area, heavier seeds, higher grain yields, and higher straw yields than did wheat grown with only pump water.
