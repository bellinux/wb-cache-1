40|$|Gaze {{estimation}} methods {{play an important}} role in a gaze tracking system. A novel 2 D gaze estimation method based on the pupil-glint vector is proposed in this paper. First, the circular ring rays location (CRRL) method and Gaussian fitting are utilized for pupil and glint detection, respectively. Then the pupil-glint vector is calculated through subtraction of pupil and glint <b>center</b> <b>fitting.</b> Second, a mapping function is established according to the corresponding relationship between pupil-glint vectors and actual gaze calibration points. In order to solve the mapping function, an improved artificial neural network (DLSR-ANN) based on direct least squares regression is proposed. When the mapping function is determined, gaze estimation can be actualized through calculating gaze point coordinates. Finally, error compensation is implemented to further enhance accuracy of gaze estimation. The proposed method can achieve a corresponding accuracy of 1. 29 °, 0. 89 °, 0. 52 °, and 0. 39 ° when a model with four, six, nine, or 16 calibration markers is utilized for calibration, respectively. Considering error compensation, gaze estimation accuracy can reach 0. 36 °. The experimental results show that gaze estimation accuracy of the proposed method in this paper is better than that of linear regression (direct least squares regression) and nonlinear regression (generic artificial neural network). The proposed method contributes to enhancing the total accuracy of a gaze tracking system...|$|R

Remote fitting through the Internet can allow a broader {{and more efficient}} coverage with a higher likelihood of success for patients covered by the SUS, as they can receive fittings from their own homes {{instead of going to}} the few and distant specialized centers. Aim: To describe a case of remote fitting between 2 cities, with revision of the literature. Method: Computer gears, a universal interface, and hearing aids were used. Case study: An audiologist located in a specialized center introduced a new hearing aid and its fitting procedure to a remote center (200 km away). The specialized center helped the remote <b>center</b> in <b>fitting</b> a hearing aid in 2 patients, and performed fitting in one of its own patients.

Conclusions: Remote fitting of hearing aids is possible through the Internet, as well as further supplying technical training to a remote <b>center</b> about the <b>fitting</b> procedures. Such a technological approach can help the government advance public policies on hearing rehabilitation, as patients can be motivated about maintaining their use of hearing aids with the option to ask for help in the comfort of their own homes...|$|R

The study required two stages of analysis. The first stage was to test the accuracy of the computer assisted software in reproducing the mathematical centers of the hard and soft tissues of the human skull. The second stage was to investigate if these new centers could be used to construct a new diagnostic reference line. The materials studied were 57 lateral cephalometric radiographs obtained from a sample of Saudi subjects with Class I occlusion. The material was divided into males and females, with an age range from 18 to 25 years of age. The collected radiographs were digitally imaged and introduced into the computer. On each radiograph, the (x, y) coordinates of 120 points were numerically captured to represent the subject’s human hard and soft tissues of the skull. The double determination method and the coefficient of reliability were applied for the evaluation of the reliability of the software. From the results, the errors were found to be very small and acceptable and the coefficient of reliability showed that the digitized and re-digitized images were highly correlated with each other. <b>Center</b> <b>fitting</b> analyses was carried out.

Different types of occlusion like occlusion for eyebrows or eyelashes are the major problem for iris detection. The intensity of iris, eyelashes and eyebrows are almost similar. Hence, it is difficult to differentiate between them. In our paper, we proposed a method which will resolve the occlusion of eyelashes and eyebrows for combined eye region and iris tracking.

40|$|Post-Newtonian {{theory was}} {{instrumental}} in conducting the critical experimental tests of general relativity and in building the astronomical ephemerides of celestial bodies {{in the solar system}} with an unparalleled precision. The cornerstone of the theory is the postulate that the solar system is gravitationally isolated {{from the rest of the}} universe and the background spacetime is asymptotically flat. The present article extends this theoretical concept and formulates the principles of celestial dynamics of particles and light moving in gravitational field of a localized astronomical system embedded to the expanding Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. We formulate the precise mathematical concept of the Newtonian limit of Einstein's field equations in the conformally-flat FLRW spacetime and analyze the geodesic motion of massive particles and light in this limit. We prove that by doing conformal spacetime transformations, one can reduce the equations of motion of particles and light to the classical form of the Newtonian theory. However, the time arguments in the equations of motion of particles and light differ from each other in terms being proportional to the Hubble constant, H. This leads to the important conclusion that the equations of light propagation used currently by Space Navigation <b>Centers</b> for <b>fitting</b> range and Doppler-tracking observations of celestial bodies are missing some terms of the cosmological origin that are proportional to the Hubble constant, H. We also prove that the Hubble expansion does not affect the atomic time scale used in creation of astronomical ephemerides.

A key feature is a kinetic scheme that allows for an extensive class of stochastic waiting time distribution functions, including power laws, expanded as a sum of weighted decaying exponentials. The solution is analytic in certain conditions, and an exact and simple expression is found for the integral contribution of “bright” and “dark” states. As an application for power law kinetics, theoretical results are compared with experimental intensity histograms {{from a number of}} blinking CdSe/ZnS quantum dots. The histograms are consistent with distributions of intensity states around a “bright” and a “dark” maximum. A gap of states is also revealed in the more-or-less flat inter-peak region.

Corneal measurements of mean central keratometry (MCK), maximum tangential curvature (TK), maximum front elevation (MFE) and eccentricity (Ecc) at 6 and 8 mm diameters as well as anterior corneal surface high order aberrations (i. e. total RMS, spherical- and coma-like and secondary astigmatism) were evaluated. RESULTS: Negative- and plano-powered soft lenses flattened (p 0. 05 in all cases) in MCK in comparison to the naked eye. The TK power decreased with negative lenses (p 0. 05 in all cases). Corneal eccentricity increased at 8 mm diameter for all lens powers (p 0. 05). Statistically differences were found in coma-like and secondary astigmatism (both p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Negative-powered soft contact lenses provide a flatter anterior surface in comparison to positive-powered lenses in subjects with keratoconus and thus they might be more suitable for piggyback contact lens <b>fitting.</b> <b>Center</b> of Physics, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.

40|$|The Galileo Telescope {{was used}} to carry out BV {{photometry}} of five faint open clusters, for which no Colour Magnitude Diagrams were available in the literature. The clusters Berkeley 24, Berkeley 35, Berkeley 78, PWM 1, and PWM 4 {{are found to be}} old open clusters. Berkeley 24, Berkeley 35, and PWM 4 show a red clump. We fitted Padova isochrones to derive reddening and distance. The clusters Berkeley 35 and Berkeley 78 show low E(B − V) = 0. 0 and 0. 01 compatible with their relatively high Galactic latitudes, whereas higher values of E(B − V) = 0. 4, 0. 94 and 0. 62 are found for Berkeley 24, PMW 1, PMW 4. Their distances to the Sun are in the range 4. 4 < dʘ < 7. 9 kpc implying that they are at distances of 11. 5 to 13. 5 kpc from the Galactic <b>center.</b> The isochrone <b>fitting</b> show ages in the range 1. 0 < Age (Gyr) < 6. 3. Further discussion of the different methods used to derive age is given, in particular using the difference in magnitude between turn-off and giant clump, which gives lower ages. The contribution of the five old open clusters studied here, with basic parameters known, increases the overall sample to 108 objects. An important addition is the very old (6. 3 Gyr) open cluster PWM 4...|$|R
