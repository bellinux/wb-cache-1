5|$|Many people camp on Helvellyn {{throughout}} the year, often near Red Tarn which gives good views of Striding Edge, Swirral Edge, and {{the summit of}} Helvellyn itself. Although camping in England is illegal without {{the permission of the}} landowner, there is a tradition of wild camping in the Lake District. This has often been tolerated so long as people have camped unobtrusively, for no more than one night, and have left no trace of their <b>campsite</b> behind.|$|E
5|$|Nobody except Leslie {{really cares}} about the trip: Ron (Nick Offerman) just wants to fish, Ben (Adam Scott) failed to bring a tent, and Tom (Aziz Ansari) just wants to relax in his huge tent filled with luxury {{electronic}} items. Tom expresses confusion as to why Ben, a state auditor who had been helping with Pawnee's financial problems, has not returned to his old job at Indianapolis; Ben does not explain his reasons, but it is hinted he harbors romantic feelings for Leslie. Meanwhile, Andy (Chris Pratt) sets up a romantic tent for April (Aubrey Plaza) in the wrong <b>campsite</b> miles away, forcing him to trek through the wilderness to find everyone and leaving April miserable on the <b>campsite</b> without Andy. During brainstorming sessions, nobody produces any good ideas because they assume Leslie will think of one. However, she worriedly confides to Ann and Ben she cannot think of anything {{on the same level}} of the harvest festival.|$|E

Campers sometimes secure <b>campsites</b> less than 6 months in advance by checking the reservation system frequently until a vacancy opens.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This article {{draws on}} three {{separate}} research and monitoring studies to describe 20 -year {{trends in the}} number and condition of <b>campsites</b> in the backcountry of Grand Canyon National Park. Results are {{used to assess the}} effectiveness of a complex and innovative management program, adopted in 1983, that sought to concentrate use on designated <b>campsites</b> in popular places and disperse camping in more remote places. In 1984, conditions on 12 high-use <b>campsites</b> and 12 low-use <b>campsites</b> were care-fully assessed. Conditions on 22 of these <b>campsites</b> were reassessed in 2005. In addition, campsite-monitoring sur-veys were conducted between 1985 and 1992 and again in 2003 and 2004. In these surveys, all <b>campsites</b> were located and their condition rapidly assessed. The detailed assess-ment of a sample of sites suggests relatively little change in condition during the 20 -year period. The high-use sites were more highly disturbed than the low-use sites, but they did not change more during the study period. In contrast, changes at larger scales were dramatic. The total number of <b>campsites</b> more than doubled during the study period. Surprisingly, the proliferation of new <b>campsites</b> was greater in places where camping was only allowed on designated <b>campsites</b> than in places where camping was allowed anywhere. Concern that concentration of use on designated sites would cause unacceptable impact was unfounded. Management implications for other interna-tionally significant protected areas that allow backcountry camping are explored...|$|R
5|$|The first Wood Badge {{training}} in the Netherlands was held in July 1923 by Scoutmaster Jan Schaap,on Gilwell Ada's Hoeve, Ommen. At Gilwell Sint Walrick, Overasselt, the Catholic Scouts had their training.

5|$|The two journey out, {{finding a}} river {{that they were}} unaware of; the couple follow the river and make {{observations}} as they go. While resting under a tree, the man finds {{the remains of a}} <b>campsite,</b> discovering that the area they were in has been inhabited. Later, they find another <b>campsite</b> and massive, oddly shaped trees with markings on one. They find a decrepit boat they could use to cross the river, but continue up into the mountains. While climbing a small hill, the man sees a snake and tumbles down on the woman. Further on, they hear chirping in a tree, and pause briefly to observe a bird and its chick in a nest. While resting at a miniature river, the woman discovers that they are on the cliff of a large waterfall. After contemplating it, they decide to discover what the mountains are like.|$|E

50|$|Designated backcountry <b>campsites</b> are {{scattered}} throughout the park. A permit, available at ranger stations and via the Park website, is required for all backcountry camping.
