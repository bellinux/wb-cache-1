25|$|Routing {{and milling}} are conceptually similar, and end mills {{can be used}} in routers, but routing wood is {{different}} from milling metal in terms of the mechanics involved; the <b>chip</b> <b>formation</b> is different, and the optimal tool geometry is thus different. Routing is properly applied to relatively weak and brittle materials, typically wood. As these materials are weak in small sections, routers may be run at extremely high speeds and so even a small router may cut rapidly. Owing to inertia at these high speeds, the normal wood cutting mechanism of Type I chips cannot take place. The cutter edge angle is blunt, approaching 90°, and so a Type III chip is formed, with the waste material being produced as fine dust. This dust is a respiratory hazard, even in benign materials. The forces against the cutter are light, so routers may be hand-held.|$|E

The entrance chipping morphologies, produced with and without ultrasonic, were observed and evaluated with respect to the fracture mechanics of brittle material. Giving consideration to the variation characteristics of the plastic deformation region in the interior material induced by the specific kinematics principles of the abrasive, the ultrasonic effects on the <b>chipping</b> <b>formation</b> mechanisms were investigated by assessing the groove morphologies obtained in the scratching experiment utilizing the formation mechanisms of the lateral cracking. Furthermore, the formal confirmatory tests with and without ultrasonic were performed to validate these <b>chipping</b> <b>formation</b> mechanisms. It was found that the plastic deformed region reached its maximum at the trajectory bottom. Moreover, the propagation of the lateral cracking initially nucleated {{at the bottom of the}} ductile deformation zone resulted in the formation of the entrance chipping in formal RUD process. The slight deformation of the material at the two terminals of each groove produced with ultrasonic would provide the inhibitory effects to the further extending of the lateral cracks, which would shrink with the increased spindle speed, and the inhibitory effect dominated in determining the improvement effects on the hole entrance quality. Additionally, a theoretical relationship between the nucleation depth and the propagation length of the lateral cracking was developed for the conventional drilling (CD) process...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{conventional}} homogeneous {{materials can}} no longer effectively satisfy the growing demands on product capabilities and performance, due to the advancement in products design and materials engineering. Therefore, the fibre reinforced composites (FRCs) with better properties and desirable applications emerged. These enhanced qualities of the FRCs have emphasized the need for analysing their machinability for further improvement of performance. Hence, this paper presents a comprehensive investigation on the machinability effects of drilling parameters (feed rate, cutting speed and thrust force), drill diameters and <b>chips</b> <b>formation</b> mainly on delamination and surface roughness of hemp fibre reinforced polymer (19 /HFRP) and carbon fibre reinforced polymer (MTM 44 - 1 /CFRP) composite laminates, using high speed steel (HSS) drills under dry machining condition. The results obtained depict that an increase in feed rate and thrust force caused an increase in delamination and surface roughness of both samples, different from cutting speed. Also, increased drill diameter and types of <b>chips</b> <b>formation</b> caused an increase in both delamination and surface roughness of both samples, as the material removal rate (MRR) increased. Evidently, the minimum surface roughness and delamination factor of the two samples for an optimal drilling are associated with feed rates of 0. 05 – 0. 10 mm/rev and cutting speed of 30 m/min...|$|R
