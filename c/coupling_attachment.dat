40|$|A {{very simple}} {{strategy}} to prepare, in two steps, a versatile and sustainable monolayer platform for on-surface chemistry is presented. The first step {{consists of the}} electroreduction of well-known 4 -nitrobenzenediazonium {{in the presence of}} a radical scavenger, leading to a covalent monolayer surface modification. Then, a dense reactive phenylamine monolayer is obtained through the full electroreduction of the nitrophenyl moieties. The platform thus obtained is available for post-functionalization with carboxyl derivatives through a usual peptide <b>coupling.</b> <b>Attachment</b> of a TEMPO unit, offering both redox and electrocatalytic properties, validates this approach and leads to high surface coverage and fast electron transfer. A comparison of the electrochemical properties of the modified surface with a classical multilayered post-functionalized one highlights important differences in terms of interfacial reactivity. The results presented here justify the interest in preparing a reactive monolayer platform for molecule grafting and paves the way for simple and controlled surface chemistry without the need of synthesis...|$|E

The longest run cycle for the machine was 18 months yet with less than 10 MW power production. The average time between failures was {{less than six months}} and with each failure; the wheel was completely damaged and separated from the shaft. A complete metallurgical study on previous failures showed the hirth <b>coupling</b> <b>attachment</b> was the first to fail in all cases. Using fully coupled non-linear contact point FEA analysis and benefiting from advancement in machining techniques, new four-lobe polygon shaft-wheel attachments were designed for high speed, high power and high temperature applications. The redesign reduced the hub centrifugal stress by 30 percent, allowed the shaft to be inserted inside the wheel to hold the wheel C. G. on the shaft, and increased the power transfer capacity of the rotary parts. By holding the wheel on the shaft, other problems like high vibration, electrical current passing through the unit, and incorrect blade resonance could be addressed and resolved. For more than two years, the redesigned machine has run continuously without any failures and with constant low vibration producing up to 12 MW, at minimum 20 % above any previous operating points...|$|E

A number of efforts have been devoted to designing synthetic MECs in the past couples of decades. This thesis work has focused on developing novel strategies based on enzyme immobilization to design nano-carriers for multi-enzyme co-localization to realize kinetics enhancement and strong control of spatial arrangement of the enzymes. Three distinct approaches have been designed using different attachment methods and platforms. First, the multifunctional polystyrene nanoparticles were designed for immobilization and sequential co-localization of GOX and SHRP enzymes using covalent binding and streptavidin-biotin <b>coupling</b> <b>attachment</b> techniques. The sequentially co-localized GOX and SHRP on B/C-PS nanoparticles were capable of enhancing the overall conversion rate by approximately two-fold compared to the equivalent concentration of free enzymes in solution.

40|$|Microspheres {{have become}} an {{important}} material in the biomedical and environmental sciences, particularly {{for use in the}} detection of pathogenic microorganisms and toxins as well as for use as carriers in drug delivery. In this study, their use in microbial detection, with particular emphasis on immunochromatographic assays, was investigated. Two main types of microspheres were studied: colloidal gold and polymeric. The original plan to combine the use of colloidal gold and fluorescentdye- labelled PMMA microspheres as a signal generator, in order to enhance detection signals and improve detection limit, was abandoned when preliminary detection experiments showed that the use of colloidal gold was not so beneficial after all, taking into account the amount of light lost to absorption by the gold particles. Therefore, it was decided to use Rhodamine B-labelled PMMA microspheres. PMMA particles, both unlabelled and internally labelled with Rhodamine B, were synthesised by emulsion polymerisation and yielded monodisperse particles of around 200 nm and 300 nm, respectively. An attempt to co-polymerise MMA with HEMA to form 200 nm-sized monodisperse P(MMA-HEMA) microspheres in order to create functional –OH groups on the microsphere surface to be used in chemical covalent coupling with monoclonal antibodies resulted in aggregated microspheres and non-uniform particles, and were therefore not used for covalent <b>coupling.</b> <b>Attachment</b> of monoclonal antibodies onto the surface of Rhodamine-B labelled PMMA microspheres by passive adsorption also resulted in aggregated particles. Diffusion and detection experiments were carried out on the Rhodamine-B labelled PMMA microspheres. Diffusion of PMMA microspheres along a nitrocellulose strip was found to be 42 % slower than the diffusion of colloidal gold along a nitrocellulose strip. Using a spectrophotometer, detection experiments were performed on dilutions of an original stock solution of 1 % w/v PMMA in distilled water. The detection limit was found to be of the order of 10 - 3. This study has investigated the materials that constitute an immunochromatographic assay and has illustrated some of the complications associated with the synthesis of copolymer microspheres and immobilisation of antibodies onto their surfaces. Further work on how to improve on the methods discussed in this study have also been recommended. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} shock isolation designs {{based on}} nonlinear energy pumping caused by nonsmooth stiffness elements. In particular, we numerically study the shock isolation properties {{of a primary}} linear system of two coupled nonconservative oscillators with weakly <b>coupled</b> <b>attachments</b> possessing clearance nonlinearities. Under shock excitation the nonlinear attachments (termed nonlinear energy sinks - NESs) can be designed to absorb {{a significant portion of}} the input energy, thus enhancing the shock isolation performance of the primary system. In contrast to the classical linear vibration absorber whose operation is restricted to narrowband frequency ranges, the NESs are capable of efficiently absorbing energies caused by transient broadband disturbances, a feature that facilitates their implementation in practical applications. Moreover, the nonsmooth nonlinearities considered in this work are easily implementable since they are realized by means of linear stiffness elements. © World Scientific Publishing Company...|$|R

Foi ainda analisada a relação entre a concordância entre o casal relativamente às referidas variáveis, considerando o casal como unidade. A amostra era composta por 246 indivíduos portugueses casados entre si e com filhos. Após o preenchimento de um questionário sócio-demográfico, os questionários usados foram o A & QRIS (Moreira, 2002), a Escala de Avaliação da Satisfação em áreas da Vida Conjugal (EASAVIC) (Narciso, 2001) e o Inventário de Aliança Parental (IAP) (Abidin, 1985). Os resultados mostraram uma relação significativa entre a vinculação ao cônjuge e satisfação conjugal; a satisfação conjugal e a aliança parental; e a vinculação ao cônjuge e aliança parental. The {{purpose of}} this research is to study the relationship between two marital domains - <b>couple</b> <b>attachment</b> and marital satisfaction -, and those variables with the parental alliance. It was also analyzed the relationship between the concordance within couple concerning these variables assuming the couple as unity of analysis. We used a sample of 246 subjects married between them and with children. After the fulfilling of the social-demographic questionnaire, the instruments used were the A & QRIS (Moreira, 2002), the Evaluation Scale of Marital Satisfaction Areas (EASAVIC) (Narciso, 2001) and the Parental Alliance Inventory (PAI) (Abidin, 1985). The results show significant relationships between <b>couple</b> <b>attachment</b> and marital satisfaction; between marital satisfaction and parental alliance; and between <b>couple</b> <b>attachment</b> and parental alliance. This research aimed at studying how some Earth and Life Science (11 th grade) students and teachers interpret and react to recent socio-scientific controversies made public by the media. Two elements make this study particularly relevant: a) the actual debate concerning social impact of several scientific and technological innovations; and b) the implementation of new science curricula, which, stress the development of pupils scientific literacy through the discussion of socio-scientific controversies. Understanding the nature of science and its relation to society and culture is considered {{to be one of the}} main aspects of citizens scientific literacy (Galvão, 2001; McComas, 2000). However, several studies have shown that both school and media seem to contribute, explicitly and implicitly, to the construction of limited conceptions about science and scientists (Abd-El-Khalick and Lederman, 2000; Matthews and Davies, 1999; Praia and Cachapuz, 1998). This situation brings forth the importance of conceiving personal and professional development initiatives aimed at encouraging reflection and supporting classroom practices reconstruction (Roldão, 1999; Ponte, 1998; Schön, 1987; Loucks-Horsley, Hewson, Love and Stiles, 1998). An interpretative approach of a qualitative nature was chosen, organized in two complementary phases. The first phase was essentially based on case studies. It sought out to investigate the possible impact of these controversies on teachers and pupils conceptions (about the nature, teaching and learning of science) and also on teachers pedagogical practices. Data collection instruments included questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, classroom observation and the analysis of several documents (namely science fiction stories written by pupils). Among pupils there was a lack of procedural and epistemological knowledge of science, as well as, the presence of several stereotyped ideas about scientists features and activities. Both science teachers classroom practices and media seem to contribute to this situation. The second phase of the study, motivated by the results of the first phase, assumed an action-research format which aimed at understanding and intervening upon the reality that was revealed. The realization of pupils limited and stereotyped conceptions, as well as, certain classroom practices (characterized by the lack of explicit references to procedural and epistemological aspects of science), prompted an in-service workshop for the teachers involved in the first phase of the study. This initiative showed three potentialities of several strategies used: 1) stimulating reflection upon classroom conceptions and practices; 2) acknowledging the potential of classroom activities concerning the discussion of socio-scientific issues; and 3) constructing the professional knowledge for using this kind of activity in classroom context. However, the most important aspect of this workshop was its contribution to the identification and study of factors affecting the consistency between teachers conceptions (about the nature, teaching and learning of science) and their classroom practices. The results of this study have several educational implications. Among the most pertinent ones are: a) the potential of combined use of science fiction stories (about scientists activities) and interviews in investigating pupils conceptions about scientific activity; b) the importance of classroom discussions about media images (about science, technology and scientists activities, features and motivations); c) the importance of developing and evaluating educational materials focused on procedural and epistemological aspects of science; and d) the relevance of personal and professional development initiatives, that support teachers throughout the conception and implementation of this type of material in classroom context...|$|R
40|$|With {{professional}} counseling {{ethics and}} organizations moving to more spiritual and cultural sensitivity {{on behalf of}} their clients, there is limited research on Christian couples in the area of marital intervention. This phenomenological study examined the shared experiences of five Christian couples who participated in a Christian emotionally-focused therapy marital intensive and who reported maintaining relationship satisfaction one year later. The study assessed the effectiveness of this Christian marital counseling intervention; and identified emergent processes and themes that occurred specific to Christian couples in a marital intervention setting; and added to the God attachment and romantic attachment literature through a Christian EFT marital intervention model. I operated as the interviewer for each couple. Results yielded three major themes for the three research questions, several minor themes and a few points of interest. The SHRM was found to be an effective intervention for Christian couples to move to a secure presentation in God and romantic attachment presentation that resulted in relationship satisfaction.
