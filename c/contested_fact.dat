40|$|The {{science of}} {{genomics}} raises important {{questions about what}} it means to be a citizen in a scientific culture. Critics of genetics frequently point to public concern about genomics as a means of legitimating their own stance, whilst scientists and other proponents tend to see public opposition as based on, at best, partial information. In this paper, the complex and often contradictory rationales for public participation in debates about contested science are examined and the distinctions between engaged/un-engaged participants and expert/representative forums emphasised. The first distinction recognises the role played by experience and expertise in challenging technical arguments, whilst the second emphasises that debates about science and technology need are not solely matters of <b>contested</b> <b>fact.</b> Using these distinctions, the paper argues that the categories of ‘scientists’ and ‘the public’ need to be replaced by a more subtle differentiation between experts and citizens. The effect of this alternative terminology is to permit a more inclusive approach to the ‘technical’ whilst providing a positive role for the non-expert citizen in the democratic control of science policy...|$|E
40|$|In {{the span}} of four months, the Seventh Circuit {{reversed}} the same district court judge, Judge Samuel Der-Yeghiayan, in three separate employment discrimination opinions. In all three cases, the district court had granted the employers’ motions for summary judgment in their entirety. However, the Seventh Circuit held {{that the majority of}} these rulings were improper due to the district judge’s inattention to critical details in the record and his misplaced reliance on minor technical rulings that sidestepped the cases’ glaring issues of credibility and <b>contested</b> <b>fact.</b> This Comment reviews the common themes in the Seventh Circuit’s criticisms of the district judge and questions whether these critiques harbor a broader meaning. In {{light of the fact that}} the district judge was recently appointed by President George W. Bush, who is often criticized for his disregard for employment discrimination rights, this Comment first explores whether the Seventh Circuit’s opinions contain a political subtext. Rejecting this hypothesis due to the tempered language of the Seventh Circuit’s criticism and the conservative makeup of the panels that decided and authored these opinions, this Comment concludes that the Seventh Circuit’s criticisms can be explained as a form of socialization of a newly appointed district court judge. In that sense, these criticisms can be understood as an attempt to bring a district judge more in line with the tendencies of the Seventh Circuit’s employment discrimination jurisprudence...|$|E
40|$|Recently the United States Supreme Court has {{instructed}} us {{that any}} <b>contested</b> <b>fact,</b> {{other than a}} prior conviction, that increases the penalty for a crime must be determined by a jury. In addition, the highest court for the Commonwealth of Virginia has determined that, in capital cases, a claimed defense of mental retardation raises a jury question. Whether it is a case prompted by these high court rulings, {{one of the many}} accounting fraud prosecutions in New York, or scientific evidence presented in a products liability action in the Midwest, the American jury is repeatedly being called upon to make findings in new and complex matters. Unfortunately it is common for jurors to perform these weighty tasks in unfit conditions and without the learning tools that we take for granted in school. While computers and interactive technology are becoming commonplace in our classrooms, juror note-taking and questioning of expert witnesses have customarily been discouraged in courtrooms. Moreover, despite the wellspring of pride in our democratic ideals after September 11, 2001, corrosive myths and misgivings about the jury trial still abound. In this regard we need only reflect upon several notorious jury verdicts in the 1990 s. Laymen and litigators, who fix upon those cases, think juries too often get it wrong. In addition, there is the recently recurring diminishment of governmental funding for trial courts and widespread citizen reluctance to respond to summonses for jury duty. For example, in many large, urban court systems, the response rate to jury summoning is about 20 %. Is it any wonder that citizens are dodging jury service in record numbers? There is good news, though. A growing number of courts are taking steps to perform at a higher level with respect to jury trials. As shown below, a movement started in Arizona has taken hold in a growing number of states. Creative court administrators, courageous judges, and inspired bar leaders are joining together to bring our cherished institution of trial by jury into the 21 st century. Articles included in this issue of Court Review show how members of the legal academy are testing and demonstrating the dynamics of jury trial innovations that are founded on principles long recognized by the social sciences and business communities. Indeed, as described in this article, there now exists a National Program to Increase Citizen Participation in Jury Service through Jury Innovations. Before long, there will be an encyclopedic collection of uniform data called the “State of the States” that will tell us how every state operates each aspect of its jury trial systems. Importantly, the State of the States will provide court leaders with information about how to contact persons {{in other parts of the}} country who have undertaken and implemented successful jury trial innovations...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{establishment}} of the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1922, governments have consented to, and actively used, an ever larger number of international and transnational courts, quasi-judicial dispute settlement bodies and ad hoc arbitral tribunals for the settlement of disputes over the interpretation and application of rules of international law. Such judicial clarification of disputed interpretations of incomplete, intergovernmental agreements reduces not only the negotiation costs of governments by delegating the clarification of <b>contested</b> <b>facts</b> and legal claims to independent third-party adjudication. Judicial decision-making at intergovernmental, transnational, national and private levels also supplements rule-making and offers citizens judicial remedies for defending their rights and interests. Modern international economic law increasingly complements intergovernmental, legislative, and administrative governance by multilevel ‘judicial governance’ so as to protect rule of law more effectively for the benefit of citizens (Section I). This contribution criticizes the one-sidedly power-oriented perceptions of WTO law as ‘international law among states’ (Section II) and the related perceptions of international judges as dependent agents of states (Section III). Civil society, parliaments and democratic governments should encourage national and international judges to cooperate in their legal task of interpreting citizen-oriented international economic law ‘in conformity with principles of justice and international law’, as explicitly prescribed in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT). The legal coherence of multilevel judicial governance depends on protecting principles of procedural as well as substantive justice and a common conception of ‘rule of law’ not only in intergovernmental relations among states, but also vis-à-vis their citizens engaged in, and benefiting from, international trade (Sections IV–VIII) ...|$|R

60|$|At present, man {{applies to}} nature but half his force. He {{works on the}} world with his {{understanding}} alone. He lives in it, and masters it by a penny-wisdom; and he that works most in it, is but a half-man, and whilst his arms are strong and his digestion good, his mind is imbruted, {{and he is a}} selfish savage. His relation to nature, his power over it, is through the understanding; as by manure; the economic use of fire, wind, water, and the mariner's needle; steam, coal, chemical agriculture; the repairs of the human body by the dentist and the surgeon. This is such a resumption of power, as if a banished king should buy his territories inch by inch, instead of vaulting at once into his throne. Meantime, in the thick darkness, there are not wanting gleams of a better light,--occasional examples of the action of man upon nature with his entire force,--with reason as well as understanding. Such examples are; the traditions of miracles in the earliest antiquity of all nations; the history of Jesus Christ; the achievements of a principle, as in religious and political revolutions, and in the abolition of the Slave-trade; the miracles of enthusiasm, as those reported of Swedenborg, Hohenlohe, and the Shakers; many obscure and yet <b>contested</b> <b>facts,</b> now arranged under the name of Animal Magnetism; prayer; eloquence; self-healing; and the wisdom of children. These are examples of Reason's momentary grasp of the sceptre; the exertions of a power which exists not in time or space, but an instantaneous in-streaming causing power. The difference between the actual and the ideal force of man is happily figured by the schoolmen, in saying, that the knowledge of man is an evening knowledge, vespertina cognitio, but that of God is a morning knowledge, matutina cognitio.|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of recent scandals {{concerning}} evidence and proof {{in the administration of}} criminal justice – ranging from innocent people on death row in the United States to misuse of statistics leading to wrongful convictions in The Netherlands and elsewhere – inquiries into the logic of evidence and proof have taken on a new urgency both in an academic and practical sense. This study presents a broad perspective on logic by focusing on inference not just in isolation but as embedded in contexts of procedure and investigation. With special attention being paid to recent developments in Artificial Intelligence and the Law, specifically related to evidentiary reasoning, this book provides clarification of problems of logic and argumentation in relation to evidence and proof. As the vast majority of legal conflicts relate to <b>contested</b> <b>facts,</b> rather than <b>contested</b> law, this volume concerning facts as prime determinants of legal decisions presents an important contribution to the field for both scholars and practitioners.

It argues that dominant practices of transitional justice, promoted by external actors, prescribed narrow state-centric justice interventions that were ill-suited for a polity in which the state was highly <b>contested.</b> In <b>fact,</b> transitional justice proved divisive in Libya because attempts to project state-centric liberal justice practices were limited by their targeting of weak institutions that lacked local legitimacy and their inability to reconcile alternative normative frameworks that challenge the modern state. In addition, the weakness of Libya’s state institutions allowed thuwwar, or revolutionary armed groups, to dictate an exclusionary form of justice known as political isolation. Drawn from fieldwork conducted in Libya, this contribution provides lessons for both peacebuilding and transitional justice practice that call for a rethinking of teleological notions of transition and greater engagement with notions and concepts that fall outside dominant practices...|$|R

Though we know much about question design and evidence construction and negotiation from this work, there is more to be learned from cross-domain corpus-based research, particularly in the area of reported speech and quoting in legal discourse. This chapter focuses on pragmatic uses of the verb SAY in police interviewing and cross-examination discourse, using large specialised corpora. Combining insights from previous research on reported speech (Matoesian 2000; Galatolo 2007) in legal discourse and using a cross-corpus approach, we look at how actions of settling on agreed and <b>contested</b> evidential <b>facts</b> are accomplished. We see how patterns of use with SAY are linked to a range of institutional activities: arguing and stance making, doubting and rejecting, time-shifting and framing, which constitute professional activities of shifting and fixing states of knowledge against legal and moral discourses. Construction, acceptance and denial of the verbal “facts” is given “intertextual authority” (Matoesian 2000) by institutional participants: judges and lawyers...|$|R

But, much like the AU itself, the meaning of the planned memorial is ambivalent and <b>contested.</b> The <b>fact</b> that the AU bulldozed Ethiopia's most notorious prison in order to establish its new offices and a conference hall is richly symbolic of ‘buried memory’ – the tendency of post-colonial elites to suppress the memory of victims of state violence while celebrating chosen heroes.

40|$|Robert W. Cherny 2 ̆ 7 s {{lively and}} {{economical}} survey of Gilded Age {{politics is a}} welcome addition to Harlan Davidson 2 ̆ 7 s American History series. American Politics in the Gilded Age will be especially valuable to undergraduate and graduate students and will also {{be of interest to}} general readers and to scholars. Cherny provides a very readable narrative of key political events and personalities, and he employs an array of useful concepts that are based on the most current scholarship. American Politics in the Gilded Age is neatly divided into three chapters. In the first, 2 ̆ 2 The Domain and Power of Party, 2 ̆ 2 Cherny begins by explaining that the Gilded Age political system was one in which political parties were crucial. Cherny explains how elections worked and how parties mobilized an almost entirely male electorate. He then provides a succinct and nuanced account {{of the differences between the}} Republicans and Democrats. This chapter concludes with a discussion of groups on the periphery of party politics: Mugwumps, advocates of woman suffrage, Prohibitionists, Grangers, Greenbackers, and labor reformers. In chapter two, 2 ̆ 2 The Deadlock of National Politics, 2 ̆ 2 Cherny turns to a narrative of national political events. These events, he explains, were structured by a party system that was very closely <b>contested.</b> This <b>fact</b> contributed to 2 ̆ 2 the freezing of most federal policies during the Gilded Age. 2 ̆ 2 Still, it was not as though nothing ever happened. Cherny offers admirably clear and sophisticated explanations of the passage of legislation (such as the Bland Allison Act and the Interstate Commerce Act) and of stalemate, but compromises occasionally broke through. The final chapter of the book describes and analyzes the 2 ̆ 2 political upheaval 2 ̆ 2 of the 1890 s. With a light but sure hand, Cherny introduces the concepts of party systems and critical realignments and explains how the crisis of the 1890 s and the Populist Party produced a particular kind of realignment. The realignment that culminated in the 1896 election when William McKinley defeated William Jennings Bryan did not result in a complete revolution of the party system, as in the 1850 s. But as Cherny explains in a brief conclusion, there were several significant changes in the party system after 1896. A bibliographic essay offers an excellent survey of the relevant literature...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} article in this Journal Harold Chesnin and Geoffrey Hazard {{presented}} a breathtaking thesis: The English Court of Chancery lacked the power to 2 ̆ 2 decide fact issues itself [...] . until some time after 1800, at least a decade after the effective date of the Seventh Amendment. 2 ̆ 2 By 2 ̆ 2 fact issues 2 ̆ 2 the authors mean 2 ̆ 2 <b>contested</b> issues of <b>fact.</b> 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 The authors hypothesize that the office of the Lord Chancellor was not originally endowed with the power to decide questions of fact, though it assumed that power by the nineteenth century. 2 ̆ 2 This might mean that the Seventh Amendment requires a federal court sitting in equity to submit disputed questions of fact to a jury. Because their thesis is couched as an interpretation of the right to jury trial under the American Constitution, it has a potential for mischief in our courts and requires a swift rebuttal. Section I of this article shows that the historical sources contradict the authors 2 ̆ 7 contentions. First, the Court of Chancery did indeed have and exercise fact finding power. Second, when the court delegated factual disputes for trial at law, the verdict was advisory and nonbinding. Section II points to the larger context of the relations between equity and law for an understanding of the Chancery 2 ̆ 7 s practice of referring issues of fact to common law trial...|$|R
40|$|Observing regions, for {{instance}} in Europe, one may easily notice inequalities in the resources they devote to innovation activities and in the results they reach {{in terms of economic}} success. In this respect, it may be assumed at first glance that a hierarchy of regional environment could be established. Nevertheless, it is advocated in the paper that this does not obligatorily imply a "territorial fatality". More precisely, the analysis constitutes an attempt to highlight the role of actors who have been insufficiently taken into account by comparison to the ones traditionally examined: large companies, universities and other higher education institutions, technology transfer organisations, regional administrations and other public bodies. The actors on which the paper focuses are: (i) small and medium-sized manufacturing firms (SMEs); and (ii) knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS). In particular the case of SMEs is of interest since SMEs represent the largest proportion of manufacturing firms located in peripheral regions (and in certain peripheral regions, the whole population of manufacturing firms). For similar reasons, it seems relevant to examine also KIBS. The expansion of KIBS reflects the growing importance of their economic activity. Moreover, they are locally available even in regions with no or only little traditional innovation infrastructure. Additionally, the hypothesis is made that potentially the virtuous circle linking the innovation activities of SMEs and KIBS may compensate the impact of less favourable regional environments. The paper contains two main sections. The first section establishes the theoretical framework of the analysis. At first, the nature of the innovation phenomenon is examined, stressing its interactive character. Then, since some regional environments seem to be more favourable to innovation than others, the question of territorial fatality is addressed. In this respect, the concept of a regional hierarchy featuring the inequality between environments in terms of innovation support is introduced. Finally, two models sketching interactions implying KIBS are discussed: the first arguing that the development of KIBS reinforces the domination of core regions, the second showing a possibility for peripheral regions to escape from territorial fatality thanks to the virtuous circle of innovation linking potentially KIBS and SMEs. The second section examines empirical results. With the help of three distinct statistical treatments, the regional innovation hierarchy is <b>contested.</b> In <b>fact,</b> the empirical evidence establishes that the influence of the type of regional environment is negligible compared to other determinants. Considering that SMEs and KIBS mutually benefit from the virtuous circle associating them, the consequences regarding regional evolution patterns are discussed in the concluding section.
