50|$|As welding {{does not}} always {{require the use of}} fine tolerances, marking out is usually {{performed}} by using <b>centre</b> <b>punches,</b> hammers, tape measures and chalk.|$|R
50|$|Stampers {{produced}} from the mothers after separating were chrome plated {{to provide a}} hard stain-free surface. Each stamper was next <b>centre</b> <b>punched</b> for the pin on the playback turntable. Methods used included aligning the final locked groove over three pins, or tapping the edge while rotating under the punch until the grooves could be seen (through a microscope) to move constantly towards the centre. Either method was quite skilled and took much effort to learn. The <b>centre</b> <b>punch</b> not only punched a hole, but formed a lip which {{would be used to}} secure the stamper into the press.|$|R
25|$|Around {{the end of}} the 18th century, the Spanish dollar was in {{constant}} circulation in Eastern Canada and the United States. The value of the coin varied in different centres but was highest in Halifax. Therefore, whenever the merchants of Prince Edward Island (PEI) secured them, they sent them to Halifax {{to take advantage of the}} higher rate. The resulting shortage of money in PEI prompted the governor in 1813 to gather in all the Spanish dollars he could and have their <b>centres</b> <b>punched</b> out. Both the central plug and rims were stamped with a sunburst. The <b>punched</b> <b>centres</b> passed as shillings and the outer rims as five-shilling pieces. The combined value of the mutilated coins was thereafter 20 percent greater in PEI than outside the island (and the individual components less valuable), so as a consequence, the coins became the official currency in PEI.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} common types of cold chisels. These are the flat chisel, {{the most widely}} known type, {{which is used to}} cut bars and rods to reduce {{surfaces}} and to cut sheet metal that is too thick or difficult to cut with tin snips. The cross cut chisel is used for cutting grooves and slots. The blade narrows behind the cutting edge to provide clearance. The round nose chisel is used for cutting semi-circular grooves for oil ways in bearings. The diamond point chisel is used for cleaning out corners or difficult places and pulling over <b>centre</b> <b>punch</b> marks wrongly placed for drilling.|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} {{released}} as a 12" [...] vinyl and a cassette single. The 12" [...] single {{was limited to}} 600 copies that were pressed on black vinyl with white labels. Each copy has a [...] "DJ style sleeve" [...] with <b>centre</b> hole <b>punched</b> out and with a sticker in the upper right hand corner.|$|R
50|$|The {{game was}} {{expected}} to be an open affair and so it proved, with Cork taking the initiative early on. Dinny Long's <b>centre</b> was <b>punched</b> against the crossbar by Jimmy Barrett; however, 19-year-old Jimmy Barry-Murphy was alert to the rebound and pounced for a well-taken goal after just two minutes. With their confidence boosted, the Cork forwards settled quickly and scores came freely. At {{the other end of the}} field, Cork's John Coleman curbed the threat of Galway captain and centre-forward Liam Sammon. Cork led at the interval by 1-10 to 0-6.|$|R
40|$|Hole-flanging is {{a common}} sheet forming {{operation}} to produce structural sheet metal components. Flanges are used for appearance, rigidity, hidden joints, and strengthening of the edge of sheet metal parts. Trial-end-error {{is the most common}} approach for tooling and process design in flanging operations. This paper presents some experimental results of hole-flanging process performed on flat deep drawing steel sheets with circular hole drilled in the <b>centre.</b> Three <b>punches</b> of different geometry i. e. cylindrical, hemispherical and conical were used in this experiment. The effect of both the punch geometry and mate-rial mechanical parameters (especially strain hardening and plastic anisotropy) on the limit expansion of the hole was determined...|$|R
25|$|In 1987, the loonie was introduced, {{replacing}} the voyageur dollar {{with a new}} design, new colour, and smaller size. This coin also replaced the $1 bill, which was subsequently withdrawn from circulation by the Bank of Canada. In February 1996, the $2 coin, or toonie, was released; it currently has three varieties. (Early examples had problems with the <b>centres</b> being <b>punched</b> out in circulation.) The toonie replaced the $2 bill. To date there have been four different obverse portraits of the Queen used on Canadian coinage, with new portraits introduced in 1953, 1965, 1990 and 2003. Prior to 1990, the Queen's portraits (1953 by Mary Gillick and 1965 by Arnold Machin) were designed by the British Royal Mint, and {{were similar to those}} used on British, Australian and New Zealander coinage. The 1990 and 2003 portraits are designed by Canadian artists, 1990 effigy by Dora dePedery-Hunt and 2003 effigy by Susanna Blunt, and are unique to Canadian coinage.|$|R
50|$|Two {{years later}} Coleman won a second Munster medal. The 5-12 to 1-15 defeat of arch-rivals Kerry showed the {{traditional}} football powers that Cork were coming. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 23 September 1978 pitted Cork against Galway. The game {{was expected to}} be an open affair and so it proved, with Cork taking the initiative early on. Dinny Long's <b>centre</b> was <b>punched</b> against the crossbar by Jimmy Barrett; however, Jimmy Barry-Murphy was alert to the rebound and pounced for a well-taken goal after just two minutes. With their confidence boosted, the Cork forwards settled quickly and scores came freely. At {{the other end of the}} field, Coleman, in spite if suffering from concussion, curbed the threat of Galway captain and centre-forward Liam Sammon. Cork held an interval lead of 1-10 to 0-6. A Galway revival saw them cut the margin to just three points when Tom Naughton scored a goal, but Cork's response was controlled and efficient. Ray Cummins steadied Cork with three points in quick succession before setting up Jimmy Barry-Murphy for the clinching goal. Johnny Hughes pulled one back for the men from the West; however, it was as close as they got and the Leesiders closed out the contest with their third goal, scored by Jimmy Barrett. The 3-17 to 2-13 victory gave Coleman an All-Ireland medal.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the colony}} of New South Wales {{was founded in}} Australia in 1788, it ran into the problem {{of a lack of}} coinage, {{particularly}} since trading vessels took coins out of the colony in exchange for their cargo. In 1813, Governor Lachlan Macquarie made creative use of Â£10,000 in Spanish dollars sent by the British government. To make it difficult to take the coins out of the colony, and to double their number, the centres of the coins were punched out. The <b>punched</b> <b>centre,</b> known as the [...] "dump", was valued at 15 pence, and the outer rim, known as the [...] "holey dollar", was worth five shillings. This was indicated by over-stamping the two new coins. The obverse of the holey dollar was stamped the words [...] "New South Wales" [...] and the date, 1813, and the reverse with the words [...] "five shillings". The obverse of the dump was stamped with a crown, the words [...] "New South Wales" [...] and the date, 1813, and the reverse with the words [...] "fifteen pence". The mutilated coins became the first official currency produced specifically for circulation in Australia. The expedient was relatively short lived. The British Parliament passed the Sterling Silver Money Act in 1825, which made British coins the only recognised form of currency and ended any legitimate use of the holey dollar and dump in the Australian colonies.|$|R
40|$|An {{increase}} or accumulation in tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases- 3 (TIMP- 3) protein in Bruch's membrane with ageing in normal eyes, and in age related macular degeneration (AMD) {{has been previously}} demonstrated. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether the expression of TIMP- 3 mRNA increases with age, and to define any relationship between altered expression and Bruch's membrane thickness. Normal eyes were obtained from 30 donors (age range 15 - 90 years). Full-thickness 8 mm macular <b>punches</b> <b>centred</b> on the fovea were taken to allow removal of the chorioretinal complex, for subsequent nucleic acid extraction. Samples were normalized for RNA degradation using beta-actin reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A competitive RT-PCR was then used to allow measurement of TIMP- 3 gene expression in each sample. The tissue adjacent to that used for nucleic acid extraction was processed histologically to allow determination of Bruch's membrane thickness. Bruch's membrane thickness was found to increase with age (P < 0. 01), but TIMP- 3 expression, as measured by competitive RT-PCR, was not significantly increased with age (P = 0. 19). An inverse correlation was noted between TIMP- 3 expression and Bruch's membrane thickness after controlling for age (P = 0. 032). The results of this study suggest that TIMP- 3 expression does not alter significantly with age. Therefore, accumulation of the TIMP- 3 protein must occur by a mechanism other than increased expression. TIMP- 3 protein levels may still prove to contribute to events associated with ageing in the macula, such as matrix remodelling in Bruch's membrane. Further studies are required to elucidate the precise interactions and turnover of the TIMP- 3 protein, and resulting changes in the control of matrix metalloproteinase activity in the ageing macula...|$|R
