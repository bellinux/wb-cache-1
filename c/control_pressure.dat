2500|$|About {{this time}} the {{invention}} of the Whitehead torpedo posed a control problem which required accurate control of the running depth. Use of a depth pressure sensor alone proved inadequate, and a pendulum which measured the fore and aft pitch of the torpedo was combined with depth measurement to become the pendulum-and-hydrostat <b>control.</b> <b>Pressure</b> control only provided a proportional control, which if the control gain was too high, would become unstable and go into overshoot, with considerable instability of depth-holding. The pendulum added what is now known as derivative control, which damped the oscillations by detecting the torpedo dive/climb angle and thereby the rate of change of depth. This development (named by Whitehead as [...] "The Secret" [...] to give no clue to its action) was around 1868.|$|E

50|$|Fuel {{is pumped}} from the tank {{to a large}} control valve called a fuel {{distributor}}, which divides the single fuel supply line from the tank into smaller lines, one for each injector. The fuel distributor is mounted atop a control vane through which all intake air must pass, and the system works by varying fuel volume supplied to the injectors based on {{the angle of the}} air vane in the air flow meter, which in turn is determined by the volume of air passing the vane, and by the <b>control</b> <b>pressure.</b> The <b>control</b> <b>pressure</b> is regulated with a mechanical device called the <b>control</b> <b>pressure</b> regulator (CPR) or the warm-up regulator (WUR). Depending on the model, the CPR may be used to compensate for altitude, full load, and/or a cold engine. The injectors are simple spring-loaded check valves with nozzles; once fuel system pressure becomes high enough to overcome the counterspring, the injectors begin spraying.|$|E

50|$|There {{are other}} ways of {{controlling}} fuel flow for example with the dash-pot throttle lever. The throttle has a gear which meshes with the control valve (like a rack and pinion) causing it to slide along a cylinder which has ports at various positions. Moving the throttle and hence sliding the valve along the cylinder, opens and closes these ports as designed. There are actually 2 valves viz. the throttle and the control valve. The control valve is used to <b>control</b> <b>pressure</b> {{on one side of}} the throttle valve such that it gives the right opposition to the throttle <b>control</b> <b>pressure.</b> It does this by controlling the fuel outlet from within the cylinder.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> {{ventilation}} is {{a common}} mode of ventilation used to manage both adult and pediatric populations. However, {{there is very little}} evidence that distinguishes the efficacy of <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation over that of volume controlled ventilation in the adult population.

This article provides a brief overview of the applications of both <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation and volume controlled ventilation and proposes an algorithmic approach to the management of patients receiving <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation. This algorithmic approach highlights the need for clinicians to have a comprehensive conceptual understanding of mechanical ventilation, pulmonary physiology, and interpretation of ventilator graphics in order to best care for patients receiving <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation. The objective of identifying a systematic approach to managing <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation is to provide a more generalizable and equitable approach to management of the ICU patient. Ideally, a consistent approach to managing <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation in the adult population will glean more reliable information regarding actual patient outcomes, as well as the efficacy of <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation when compared to volume controlled ventilation...|$|R
