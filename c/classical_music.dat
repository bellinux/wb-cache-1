5|$|<b>Classical</b> <b>music</b> {{was brought}} to the United States with some of the first colonists. European <b>classical</b> <b>music</b> is rooted in the {{tradition}}s of European art, ecclesiastical and concert music. The central norms of this tradition developed between 1550 and 1825, centering on {{what is known as the}} common practice period. Many American classical composers attempted to work entirely within European models until late in the 19th century. When Antonín Dvořák, a prominent Czech composer, visited the United States from 1892 to 1895, he iterated the idea that American <b>classical</b> <b>music</b> needed its own models instead of imitating European composers; he helped to inspire subsequent composers to make a distinctly American style of <b>classical</b> <b>music.</b> By the beginning of the 20th century, many American composers were incorporating disparate elements into their work, ranging from jazz and blues to Native American music.|$|E

5|$|European <b>classical</b> <b>music</b> changed {{greatly in}} the 20th century. New music {{abandoned}} {{much of the}} historical, nationally developed schools of harmony and melody in favor of experimental music, atonality, minimalism and electronic music, all of which employ features that have become common to European music in general and not Italy specifically. These changes have also made <b>classical</b> <b>music</b> less accessible to many people. Important composers of the period include Ottorino Respighi, Ferruccio Busoni, Alfredo Casella, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Franco Alfano, Bruno Maderna, Luciano Berio, Luigi Nono, Sylvano Bussotti, Salvatore Sciarrino, Luigi Dallapiccola, Carlo Jachino, Gian Carlo Menotti, Jacopo Napoli, and Goffredo Petrassi.|$|E

5|$|Homophony first {{appeared}} {{as one of}} the predominant textures in Western <b>classical</b> <b>music</b> during the Baroque period in the early 17th century, when composers began to commonly compose with vertical harmony in mind, the homophonic basso continuo becoming a definitive feature of the style. The choral arrangement of four voices (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass) has since become common in Western <b>classical</b> <b>music.</b> Homophony began by appearing in sacred music, replacing polyphony and monophony as the dominant form, but spread to secular music, for which {{it is one of the}} standard forms today.|$|E

5|$|Italian <b>classical</b> <b>music</b> grew {{gradually}} more {{experimental and}} progressive into the mid-20th century, while popular tastes {{have tended to}} stick with well established composers and compositions of the past. The 2004-2005 program at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples is typical of modern Italy: of the eight operas represented, the most recent was Puccini. In symphonic music, of the 26 composers whose music was played, 21 of them were from the 19th century or earlier, composers who use the melodies and harmonies typical of the Romantic era. This focus is common to other European traditions, and is known as postmodernism, a school of thought that draws on earlier harmonic and melodic concepts that pre-date the conceptions of atonality and dissonance. This focus on popular historical composers has helped to maintain a continued presence of <b>classical</b> <b>music</b> across {{a broad spectrum of}} Italian society. When music is part of a public display or gathering, it is often chosen from a very eclectic repertoire that is as likely to include well-known <b>classical</b> <b>music</b> as popular music.|$|E
