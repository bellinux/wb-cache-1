5|$|Astronomy {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} of the natural sciences. The early civilizations in {{recorded}} history, such as the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Nubians, Iranians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient Indigenous Peoples of The Americas performed methodical observations of the night sky. Historically, astronomy has included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, <b>celestial</b> <b>navigation,</b> observational astronomy and the making of calendars, but professional astronomy is now often considered to be synonymous with astrophysics.|$|E
5|$|On 26 May, while {{rounding}} {{the southern tip}} of Africa, Arniston separated from the convoy in bad weather after her sails were damaged. Without accurate daily longitudinal information from the other ships, Arniston had to rely instead on older, less accurate navigation methods. Navigation via dead reckoning proved particularly difficult as there were strong ocean currents combined with inclement weather that prevented a fix being obtained for several days via <b>celestial</b> <b>navigation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{stars have}} been {{important}} to civilizations throughout the world. They {{have been part of}} religious practices and used for <b>celestial</b> <b>navigation</b> and orientation. Many ancient astronomers believed that stars were permanently affixed to a heavenly sphere and that they were immutable. By convention, astronomers grouped stars into constellations and used them to track the motions of the planets and the inferred position of the Sun. The motion of the Sun against the background stars (and the horizon) was used to create calendars, which could be used to regulate agricultural practices. The Gregorian calendar, currently used nearly everywhere in the world, is a solar calendar based on the angle of the Earth's rotational axis relative to its local star, the Sun.|$|E

50|$|As {{early as}} the mid-1960s, {{advanced}} electronic and computer systems had evolved enabling navigators to obtain automated celestial sight fixes. These systems were used aboard both ships and US Air Force aircraft, and were highly accurate, able to lock onto up to 11 stars (even in daytime) and resolve the craft's position to less than 300 ft. The SR-71 high-speed reconnaissance aircraft was one example of an aircraft that used a combination of automated <b>celestial</b> and inertial <b>navigation.</b> These rare systems were expensive, however, and the few that remain in use today are regarded as backups to more reliable satellite positioning systems.|$|R
50|$|While sailing groups {{organize}} {{the most active}} and popular competitive yachting, other boating events are also held worldwide: speed motor boat racing; competitive canoeing, kayaking, and rowing; and navigational contests (generally a test of <b>celestial</b> and landmark-based <b>navigation</b> skills where GPS and other electronic navigation equipment is disallowed) are among the events which are organized around the world. Specialized yachts, such as hydrofoils, hovercrafts, or personal watercrafts also engage in competitions involving test of equipment and skill (usually, skill in maneuvering safely). All such events {{are part of the}} larger world of yachting, if they are done for recreational or sporting purposes.|$|R
25|$|A planetarium (plural planetaria or planetariums) is a theatre built {{primarily}} for presenting educational and entertaining shows about astronomy {{and the night}} sky, or for training in <b>celestial</b> <b>navigation.</b>|$|E

25|$|European sailing {{had been}} {{primarily}} close to land cabotage, guided by portolan charts. These charts specified proven ocean routes guided by coastal landmarks: sailors departed from a known point, followed a compass heading, {{and tried to}} identify their location by its landmarks.

Arab navigational tools like the astrolabe and quadrant were used for <b>celestial</b> <b>navigation.</b>|$|E
25|$|French Polynesia {{as we know}} {{it today}} was one of the last places on Earth to be settled by humans.

50|$|The {{resupply}} {{was mostly}} operated {{during the winter}} period while the runway was suitable for aircraft landing. This also indicated operating during the most severe weather conditions, such as very low ceilings and prevailing reduced visibility. Accurate weather forecasting was not available until much later, due {{to the absence of}} reporting stations and the distance to travel over remote arctic wastes. Winds in excess of 45 knots and temperatures below minus 30° Fahrenheit had also been recorded at both stations during resupply operations. Resupply for T-3 was hampered by a mix of varying obstacles. Due to the iceberg's constantly moving location, resupply had to be operated from two air bases Point Barrow, Alaska and Thule Air Base, Greenland. At that time, flights were conducted without navigational aids, and the aircraft landing on the constantly moving iceberg T-3 was performed solely by dead reckoning and <b>celestial</b> grid <b>navigation,</b> which was often hampered by long periods of twilight which prevented celestial observation. Also, because the nearest alternate air bases were 475 mi away, potential in-flight emergencies could result in fatal outcomes. In this regard, pilots and their crews had to calculate cargo and fuel loads precisely to insure not only a safe landing but also a safe return from the iceberg.|$|R
40|$|To perform close {{proximity}} operations under a low-gravity environment, relative and absolute positions are vital {{information to the}} maneuver. Hence navigation is inseparably integrated in space travel. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is presented as an optical navigation method around small <b>celestial</b> bodies. Optical <b>Navigation</b> uses visual observation instruments such as a camera to acquire useful data and determine spacecraft position. The required input data for operation is merely a single image strip and a nadir image. ELM is a machine learning Single Layer feed-Forward Network (SLFN), a type of neural network (NN). The algorithm is developed on the predicate that input weights and biases can be randomly assigned and does not require back-propagation. The learned model is the output layer weights which are used to calculate a prediction. Together, Extreme Learning Machine Optical Navigation (ELM OpNav) utilizes optical images and ELM algorithm to train the machine to navigate around a target body. In this thesis the asteroid, Vesta, is the designated celestial body. The trained ELMs estimate {{the position of the}} spacecraft during operation with a single data set. The results show the approach is promising and potentially suitable for on-board navigation...|$|R
25|$|Through {{contacts}} in the Los Angeles aviation community, Fred Noonan was subsequently chosen as a second navigator because there were significant additional factors {{that had to be}} dealt with while using <b>celestial</b> <b>navigation</b> for aircraft. He had vast experience in both marine (he was a licensed ship's captain) and flight navigation. Noonan had recently left Pan Am, where he established most of the company's China Clipper seaplane routes across the Pacific. Noonan had also been responsible for training Pan American's navigators for the route between San Francisco and Manila. The original plans were for Noonan to navigate from Hawaii to Howland Island, a particularly difficult portion of the flight; then Manning would continue with Earhart to Australia and she would proceed on her own {{for the remainder of the}} project.|$|E
25|$|Sailors {{navigating}} in the Mediterranean {{made use}} of several techniques to determine their location, including staying in sight of land {{and understanding of the}} winds and their tendencies. Minoans of Crete are an example of an early Western civilization that used <b>celestial</b> <b>navigation.</b> Their palaces and mountaintop sanctuaries exhibit architectural features that align with the rising sun on the equinoxes, as well as the rising and setting of particular stars. The Minoans made sea voyages to the island of Thera and to Egypt. Both of these trips would have taken more than a day’s sail for the Minoans and would have left them traveling by night across open water. Here the sailors would use the locations of particular stars, especially those of the constellation Ursa Major, to orient the ship in the correct direction.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{inaccuracy}} of <b>celestial</b> <b>navigation</b> {{for night}} navigation and target finding in a fast moving aircraft, the Luftwaffe developed radio navigation devices and relied on three systems: Knickebein (Crooked leg), X-Gerät (X-Device), and Y-Gerät (Y-Device). This led the British to develop countermeasures, which {{became known as}} the Battle of the Beams. Bomber crews already had some experience with the Lorenz beam, a commercial blind-landing aid for night or bad weather landings. The Germans adapted the short-range Lorenz system into Knickebein, a 30–33MHz system, which used two Lorenz beams with much stronger signals. Two aerials at ground stations were rotated so that their beams converged over the target. The German bombers would fly along either beam until they picked up the signal from the other beam. When a continuous sound was heard from the second beam the crew knew they were above the target and dropped their bombs.|$|E
25|$|The early A-3 {{variants}} had {{a crew of}} three: pilot, bombardier/navigator (BN) and crewman/navigator (aka: third crewman). An unusual cockpit configuration {{was incorporated}} with the three crew sitting under a framed canopy. In the raised compartment, the pilot and bombardier/navigator sat in a side-by-side arrangement with the pilot's station {{on the port side}} having full flight controls. On initial variants, a third crew member, who also acted as a gunner for the twin tail-mounted 20mm cannons that briefly equipped the original bomber version of the A3D/A-3A (removed and replaced by ECM equipment), sat behind the pilot in an aft-facing seat. The third crewman station had the sextant for <b>celestial</b> <b>navigation</b> and the defensive electronic counter measures equipment. Later electronic reconnaissance variants could accommodate a crew of seven with the flight crew consisting of a pilot, co-pilot and navigator plus four electronic systems operators occupying stations in the former bomb bay in the spacious fuselage.|$|E
25|$|Critical to Pan Am's {{success as}} an airline was the {{proficiency}} of its flight crews, who were rigorously trained in long-distance flight, seaplane anchorage and berthing operations, over-water navigation, radio procedure, aircraft repair, and marine tides. During the day, {{use of the}} compass while judging drift from sea currents was normal procedure; at night, all flight crews were trained to use <b>celestial</b> <b>navigation.</b> In bad weather, pilots used dead reckoning and timed turns, making successful landings at fogged-in harbors by landing out to sea, then taxiing the plane into port. Many pilots had merchant marine certifications and radio licenses as well as pilot certificates. A Pan Am flight captain would normally begin his career years earlier as a radio operator or even mechanic, steadily gaining his licenses and working {{his way up the}} flight crew roster to navigator, second officer, and first officer. Before World War II it was not unusual for a captain to make engine repairs at remote locations.|$|E
25|$|Moths {{frequently}} {{appear to}} circle artificial lights, although {{the reason for}} this behavior remains unknown. One hypothesis to explain this behavior is that moths use a technique of <b>celestial</b> <b>navigation</b> called transverse orientation. By maintaining a constant angular relationship to a bright celestial light, such as the moon, they can fly in a straight line. Celestial objects are so far away that, even after travelling great distances, the change in angle between the moth and the light source is negligible; further, the moon will always be in {{the upper part of the}} visual field, or on the horizon. When a moth encounters a much closer artificial light and uses it for navigation, the angle changes noticeably after only a short distance, in addition to being often below the horizon. The moth instinctively attempts to correct by turning toward the light, thereby causing airborne moths to come plummeting downward, and resulting in a spiral flight path that gets closer and closer to the light source.|$|E
