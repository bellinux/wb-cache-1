40|$|<b>Farmer</b> <b>organization</b> and {{collective}} action are {{often seen as}} key factors in enhancing farmers' access to markets. Often, too little attention is directed at (a) the most appropriate types of organization; (b) whether organization makes less or more sense {{in the case of}} producers of an undifferentiated commodity or a higher value product; (c) whether the public or private sector is best placed to support farmer organizations; and (d) the conditions necessary for ensuring their economic viability. Research in Mexico and Central America explored these issues for commodity maize and high value vegetables, respectively. The benefits of <b>farmer</b> <b>organization</b> are more evident in the vegetable sector, characterized by high transaction costs associated with market access. However, horticultural <b>farmer</b> <b>organizations</b> in Honduras and El Salvador include less than 5 % of total horticultural producers. This is possibly due to farmer organizations' limited business skills and non-replicable organizational models. There is less incentive for maize farmers to organize to access output markets as the transaction costs are relatively low. The benefits of maize <b>farmer</b> <b>organization</b> are clearer when it comes to accessing inputs such as credit, seed and fertilizer. <b>Farmer</b> <b>organization</b> is a critical factor in making markets work for the poor, but the role and timing of public and private investment in these organizations is poorly understood. <b>Farmer</b> <b>organization</b> Collective action Maize High value agricultural products Mexico Central America Value chains Pro-poor growth...|$|R

40|$|Vegetable {{production}} {{is of great}} importance in terms of nutrition improvement, income generation and food security. Africa Research in Sustainable Intensification for the Next Generation (Africa RISNG) action research project actively integrates vegetable farming and marketing practices {{in order to reduce}} the vulnerability of indigenous populations of Babati district located in the Manyara region of Tanzania. In Tanzania smallholder vegetable famers receive asymmetrical and incomplete market information which is costly. Mobilizing farmers into groups so as to access viable market information while enhancing their bargaining power is one way to overcome this challenge. However, the extent to which this has been achieved has not yet been evaluated. This study sought to evaluate the influence of <b>farmer</b> <b>organizations</b> towards improving smallholder income in Babati. Objectives of the study were: to determine types of market information accessed by smallholder vegetable <b>farmers</b> through <b>farmer</b> <b>organizations,</b> determine factors influencing information seeking behaviour of vegetable farmers and determine effect of access to market provided by <b>farmer</b> <b>organizations</b> on smallholder vegetable farmer’s income. The target population was smallholder farmers who grow vegetables within maize based farming systems. Multi-stage sampling technique was employed where by 250 smallholders’ vegetable farmers were interviewed using structured questionnaire. The results showed that the type of market (29 %) is the most type of market information accessed by vegetable <b>farmer</b> through <b>farmer</b> <b>organization.</b> From the Poisson model the results show that distance to the market information source point has a negative influence on farmer’s information seeking behaviour. In contrast, gender, education, income and group membership had a significant positive relationship with farmers’ information seeking behaviour. In estimating the effect of access to market provided by <b>farmer</b> <b>organizations</b> on smallholder vegetable farmer’s income, Propensity Score Matching (PSM) was used. The results indicate that farmers who had access to the market provided by <b>farmer</b> <b>organization</b> have more income (501691. 413 TZS) than non member (405471. 429 TZS). From the results, it is recommended that an enabling policy environment that establishes and strengthens <b>farmer</b> <b>organizations</b> be supported. This will assist in transforming smallholder farming as viable business ventures through increased productivity and increased household incomes while reducing rural poverty.

40|$|The {{success of}} {{irrigation}} heavily {{depends upon the}} good water management which essentially requires efficient <b>farmer</b> <b>organization.</b> Within the Nong Wai Pioneer Agriculture Project in the northeast of Thailand, there are various <b>farmer</b> <b>organizations</b> and the Nong Wai Agricultural Cooperative Society (NACS) is one of them.

But the finding from this study shows that the integration of these <b>farmer</b> <b>organizations</b> is not successful {{and there is still}} competition among various organizations in rendering the service to farmers. The NACS, as indicated in this paper, largely involves only in the provision of agricultural credit to farmers. In the field of water management the NACS was assigned to collect the operation and maintenance (0 and M) fee from farmers and it could perform this function well during the year of study. But without having a strong and definite penalty for those who fail to pay for the fee, the number of members who do not pay for the 0 and M fee is expected to increase.

This paper addresses professional collaboration found in tenure relations, social and professional organizations.

The analysis suggests that participation in organizations is a key factor influencing adoption of irrigation technology.

40|$|The global {{agricultural}} economy is changing. Commodity prices are declining, and producers increasingly supply complex value chains. There is {{growing interest in}} how farmers can benefit from emerging market opportunities. Farmers are encouraged to produce high value crops and engage in value-adding activities such as agro-processing. <b>Farmer</b> <b>organization</b> and collective action are often seen as key factors in enhancing farmers' access to markets. Often too little attention is directed at a) the most appropriate types of organization, b) whether the public and/or private sector is best placed to support their formation, and c) the conditions necessary for ensuring their economic viability. This paper reports on research in Mexico and Central America that explored these issues for commodity maize and high value vegetables respectively. The benefits of <b>farmer</b> <b>organization</b> are more evident in the vegetable sector characterized by high transaction costs associated with market access. The research suggests that <b>farmer</b> <b>organizations</b> established by and directly linked to supermarkets may be more economically sustainable as opposed to organizations supported by non-governmental organizations. However, the most representative vegetable producer organizations in both Honduras and El Salvador include fewer than 5 percent of total horticultural producers. This is due to producer organizations' limited business skills and non-replicable organizational models for linking producers to markets. There is less incentive for maize farmers to organize themselves to access output markets as the transaction costs associated with market access are relatively low: {{there are so many}} buyers and sellers that <b>farmer</b> <b>organizations</b> would have little impact on, for example, prices. The benefits of <b>farmer</b> <b>organization</b> are clearer when it comes to accessing credit, seed, and fertilizer. <b>Farmer</b> <b>organization</b> is a critical factor in making markets work for the poor particularly in high value products, but the role and timing of the substantial public and private investment needed to establish and maintain these organizations is poorly understood.
