25|$|The Sperrin {{employed}} a traditional straight wing, although the wing's {{fixed leading edge}} was slightly swept and featured <b>curved</b> <b>fillets</b> at the junction with the engine nacelles. The trailing edge had simple flaps inboard of the nacelles and large ailerons outboard; the outer flaps were to incorporate air brakes, but this was replaced with split-brakes prior to the first flight. Both the flaps and air brakes were primarily operated hydraulically, an independent system for emergency actuation was also present. Up to 6,170 imperial gallons of fuel could be housed {{in a total of}} 22 fuel tanks, 14 of these being contained within the wings and a further 8 within the fuselage; these tanks were pressurized to prevent collapse during fast dives and other manoeuvres. The wing was fixed to the fuselage at a mid-wing position, located between the bomb bay and fuselage fuel tanks.|$|E

This paper {{describes}} progress in {{research into the}} development of a computer-aided design (CAD) tool that aids designers in generating the form of a product by the use of evolutionary techniques. Genetic algorithm (GA) software has been developed and combined with a commercial CAD solid modelling system. The system creates objects that initially have the appearance of being random in form, but which can be subjected to a user-directed selective breeding programme which is also guided by pre-set internal, or environmental, factors. User scoring of each object, or an objective function, determines which objects are considered to be the ‘fittest’, and thus likely to become parents of the next generation. Through the co-operation of the user and the pre-set environmental factors, the forms on the screen progressively become more than an abstract collection of geometric primitives. It is believed that this can provide useful inspiration with regard to the aesthetics and functional characteristics of products, and the potential exists for this approach to be the basis of a new design methodology. Early work demonstrated that the software had the ability to evolve interesting shapes in line with a user’s particular criteria for rating objects. However, it was also obvious that the objects generated needed enhancement to convincingly represent some of the geometric complexities of real products. Using the CAD software’s blend function within the evolutionary process has provided that complexity, producing excellent results and greatly widening the field of application. In addition to simply creating secondary geometry through the smoothening of sharp edges or creation of <b>curved</b> <b>fillets</b> between adjoining solids, more significant and complex primary geometric forms have been generated by allowing relatively large blend radii. The current challenge is to combine the existing ability to predictably evolve simple geometric shapes, with the added complexity arising from the use of blends, to make the concept genuinely useful. The outcome of genetic manipulation needs to be predictable, to the extent that desirable features from objects are reproduced in subsequent generations. The key to this is the way the genetic shape defining data is stored and processed, especially the way the blend instructions are integrated into the existing genetic structure, and this is the major focus of continuing research...|$|E

Four-position Fowler flaps are fitted. The tailplane and elevators are rectangular in plan, with a cutout in the latter to allow rudder movement.

5000|$|The SO.3050 was {{designed}} in occupied France during World War II {{and was the}} first French two seat tourer to fly after the Liberation. It was a conventional low wing cantilever monoplane, powered by a [...] Renault 4Pei air-cooled inverted four cylinder inline engine. Pilot and passenger sat side by side under multipart glazing which ran rearwards into the raised upper fuselage. This raised region dropped away towards the tail, where the tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage. The vertical tail was straight edged but with a broad rounded top and a <b>curved</b> <b>fillet</b> to merge it into the fuselage. The tourer had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage with faired legs and spats; the tailwheel castored.|$|R
40|$|Many {{automotive}} {{components are}} produced in very large quantities using manufacturing {{processes such as}} casting, moulding and forging. These processes require tooling which usually has geometrical complexities such as doubly <b>curved</b> surfaces, <b>fillet</b> <b>curves,</b> split lines and draft angles. Traditionally the component design is conveyed to the toolmaker for manufacture of the tooling, using conven-tional engineering drawings. The paper shows how tooling and component problems can arise due to the inability of conventional two-dimensional engineering drawings to unambiguously define complex three-dimensional shapes. Modern fully integrated computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing (CADCAM) systems {{may be used to}} overcome these problems. This is achieved by producing numerically controlled machining information to manufacture the tooling directly from the computer generated component design, thus eliminating the ambiguities associated with conventional engineering drawings. The use of a fully integrated CADCAM system for the design and manufacture of automotive components and tooling is described, and the technical and economic advantages gained from its use are detailed. ...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1950s {{more than}} one French {{aircraft}} design was tested with larger scale glider models than could be put into wind-tunnels. These were piloted and launched {{from the top of}} a large aircraft like a SNCASE Languedoc, as was the SCAN 271 or alternatively towed to altitude. [...] The Arsenal 2301 was a full-scale model of a proposed rocket powered fighter aircraft which developed German ideas on swept wing aircraft expressed in the wartime DFS 346. It was a wooden aircraft, with swept, straight tapered mid-wings, square tipped at right angles to the leading edge. The fuselage was long and fine, with the cockpit well forward of the wing. The fuselage began to taper to the pointed nose just behind the canopy. The vertical tail was swept, straight tipped and tapered, though there was a <b>curved</b> <b>fillet</b> between the fin root and the fuselage. An all-moving tail, straight tapered, square tipped and with sweep on its leading edge, was placed about one-third the way up the fin. [...] The 2301 had a bicycle landing gear, with a fixed main wheel under the central fuselage and a small, retractable nose wheel; retracting stabilizing wheels were positioned near the wing tips. Its span was 8 m and length 14 m. Its primary purpose was to explore the low speed characteristics of the design.|$|R

The results of analysis show that the bending strength of gear cut by double circle arc cutter tip increases by 10 % comparing with that of gear cut by ordinary fillet cutter tip.

50|$|The Mg 23, an Erwin Musger design often {{known as}} the Musger Mg 23, was an all-wood shoulder-wing aircraft. Its wing had a {{straight}} leading edge, a constant-chord inner section with taper outboard and 2.5° of dihedral. The wingtips had small tip fences. It was built around a single wooden spar and was wood covered apart from the ailerons, which were fabric covered. Wooden Schempp-Hirth spoilers were fitted. The tail surfaces were fabric covered, the tailplane narrow in chord and straight tapered with a Flettner trim tab on the starboard elevator. One change between the prototype Mg 23 and the production Mg 23 SL was {{that the size of}} the fin and rudder was increased; on the SL the fin was straight-edged apart from a <b>curved</b> fuselage <b>fillet</b> but the trailing edge of the wide, deep rudder was rounded.|$|R

Each leg has joints that form two 180° helix-shaped strips with 12 fully interlocking spur-type gear teeth, including <b>filleted</b> <b>curves</b> {{at the base of}} each tooth {{to reduce the risk of}} shearing.

50|$|All of the L-4 {{variants}} {{have the}} same layout and are all largely built of composite materials. They are high-wing monoplanes with twin engines mounted close to the fuselage {{and on top of}} the wing. The wings have straight taper on both edges and almost square tips. The L-4 has a pair of flaps on each wing. Its hull has two steps and there are small winglets at waterlevel just aft of the trailing edge. The cabin extends from below the leading edge rearwards to the winglets. Fixed floats under the wings stabilze the L-4 on water; it is operable with waves to 400 mm (15 in) high. The most unusual feature of the L-4 is the empennage arrangement. There are twin fins, mounted on the fuselage and extended forward with long, <b>curved</b> dorsal <b>fillets,</b> separated at the base by the full fuselage width and leaning slightly outwards. The fins carry conventional rudders and the single tailplane is mounted upon the fin tips, extending well beyond them. Tailplane and single piece elevator together are trapezoidal; there is a trim tab at the centre of the elevator. The L-4 has a conventional undercarriage for land use, all three wheels and the water rudder being retractable.|$|R

40|$|While {{generating}} the working profile (involute) of {{a spur gear}} using rack cutter, the root <b>fillet</b> <b>curve</b> is generated, automatically which is a trochoid. The root fillet obtained thus is not necessarily an optimum profile in context to the bending stress induced during its operation. This work investigates the stress at the gear tooth profile by replacing the conventional trochoid <b>fillet</b> by polynomial <b>curves.</b> The circular root fillet profile is constructed by drawing an arc tangent to working profiles and root circle and this arc is taken as reference root fillet to generate alternative root fillet profile. The arc is divided into six segments. New fillet profiles are constructed by displacing the middle points radially using different relations and keeping the end points fixed. The improved root fillet profiles resulted into reduction of bending stress by 9 to 12 percentage. This results presented here are based on two dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-Gear teeth failure due to fatigue is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} observed. Even a slight reduction in the root tensile stress results in great increase in the fatigue life of a gear. If gear fails in tensile fatigue, the results are catastrophic and occur {{with little or no}} warnings. Therefore for all the reasons mentioned above, this work is of more practical importance. For many years, gear design has been improved by using improved material, hardening surfaces with heat treatment and carburization, and shot penning to improve surface finish etc. Few more efforts have been made to improve the durability and strength by altering the pressure angle, using the asymmetric teeth, altering the geometry of root <b>fillet</b> <b>curve</b> and so on. Most of the above methods do not guarantees the interchangeability of the existing gear systems. This work presents the possibilities of using the stress redistribution techniques by introducing the stress relieving features in the stressed zone to the advantage of reduction of root fillet stress in spur gear. This also ensures interchangeability of existing gear systems. In this work, combination of circular and elliptical stress relieving features are used and better results are obtained than using circular stress relieving features alone which are used by earlier researchers. A finite element model with a segment of three teeth is considered for analysis and stress relieving features of various sizes are introduced on gear teeth at various locations. Analysis revealed that, combination of elliptical and circular stress relieving features at specific, locations are beneficial than single circular, single elliptical, two circular or two elliptical stress reliving features.
