5|$|The Soviet-backed <b>communist</b> <b>government</b> was as harsh towards non-communist Jewish cultural, {{political}} and social institutions as they were towards Polish, banning all alternative parties. Thousands of Jews returned from exile in the Soviet Union, but as their number decreased with legalized aliyah to Israel, the PZPR members formed a much larger percentage of the remaining Jewish population. Among them {{were a number of}} Jewish communists who played a highly visible role in the unpopular <b>communist</b> <b>government</b> and its security apparatus.|$|E
5|$|For {{a decade}} after World War II, Piłsudski was either ignored or {{condemned}} by Poland's <b>communist</b> <b>government,</b> along with the entire interwar Second Polish Republic. This began to change, however, particularly after de-Stalinization and the Polish October (1956), and historiography in Poland gradually moved away from a purely negative view of Piłsudski toward a more balanced and neutral assessment.|$|E
5|$|The {{concrete}} bunkers of Albania are a ubiquitous {{sight in}} the country, {{with an average of}} 5.7 bunkers for every square kilometre. The bunkers (Albanian: bunkerët) were built during the <b>communist</b> <b>government</b> of Enver Hoxha from the 1960s to the 1980s; by 1983 a total of 173,371 concrete bunkers had been constructed around the country.|$|E

50|$|Following the Soviet {{doctrine}} {{regarding the}} exercise of religion, postwar <b>Communist</b> <b>governments</b> in Eastern Europe severely restricted religious freedoms. Even though some clerics collaborated with the Communist regimes, the Church's resistance and the leadership of Pope John Paul II have been credited with hastening the downfall of <b>communist</b> <b>governments</b> across Europe in 1991.|$|R
5|$|The first Polish <b>communist</b> <b>government,</b> the Polish Committee of National Liberation, {{formed in}} July 1944, {{declined}} to accept jurisdiction over Home Army soldiers, therefore {{for over a}} year Soviet agencies such as the NKVD took responsibility for disarming the Home Army. By war's end, some 60,000 Home Army soldiers had been arrested, 50,000 of whom were deported to Soviet Gulags and prisons; most of these soldiers had been taken captive by the Soviets during, or in the aftermath of, Operation Tempest, when many Home Army units tried to work together with the Soviets in a nationwide uprising against the Germans. Other Home Army veterans were arrested when they approached Polish <b>communist</b> <b>government</b> officials after having been promised amnesty. After a number of such broken promises during {{the first few years of}} communist control, Home Army soldiers stopped trusting the government.|$|E
5|$|After the Armistice on the Western Front, Lenin {{believed}} that the breakout of European revolution was imminent. Seeking to promote this, Sovnarkom supported the establishment of Béla Kun's <b>communist</b> <b>government</b> in Hungary in March 1919, followed by the <b>communist</b> <b>government</b> in Bavaria and various revolutionary socialist uprisings {{in other parts of}} Germany, including that of the Spartacus League. During Russia's Civil War, the Red Army was sent into the newly independent national republics on Russia's borders to aid Marxists there in establishing soviet systems of government. In Europe, this resulted in the creation of new communist-led states in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine, all of which were officially independent of Russia, while further east it {{led to the creation of}} communist governments in Georgia, and then in Outer Mongolia. Various senior Bolsheviks wanted these absorbed into the Russian state; Lenin insisted that national sensibilities should be respected, but reassured his comrades that these nations' new Communist Party administrations were under the de facto authority of Sovnarkom.|$|E
5|$|After the Communist Party {{seized power}} in Czechoslovakia in February 1948, the city {{became part of}} the Eastern Bloc. The city annexed new land, and the {{population}} rose significantly, becoming 90% Slovak. Large residential areas consisting of high-rise prefabricated panel buildings, such as those in the Petržalka borough, were built. The <b>Communist</b> <b>government</b> also built several new grandiose buildings, such as the Most Slovenského národného povstania bridge and the Slovak Radio headquarters.|$|E

50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of World War II, religious existence came under fire from <b>communist</b> <b>governments</b> in Eastern Europe and China.

5|$|Despite {{the violent}} {{overthrow}} of the <b>communist</b> <b>government</b> by the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front in 1991, the airline managed to post a profit for the fiscal year. The market-oriented policies {{of the new government}} meant that the airline would remain operationally independent, and under Captain Bisrat Nigatu the airline remained fiscally sound, despite disruptions caused by the Eritrean-Ethiopian War.|$|E
5|$|In early 1968, media {{coverage}} {{in the aftermath of}} the Tet Offensive spurred increased protests in opposition to the Vietnam War, especially among university students. The protests were most prevalent in the US, but on 17 March, several thousand demonstrators marched to the American embassy in London's Grosvenor Square and violently clashed with police. Major protests concerning other political issues made international news, such as the March 1968 protests in Poland against their <b>communist</b> <b>government,</b> and the campus uprisings of May 1968 in France.|$|E
5|$|Vilnius, the {{historical}} {{capital of the}} Grand Duchy of Lithuania, {{became part of the}} Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic and was soon proclaimed capital of the Lithuanian–Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Lit-Bel) on February 27, 1919. The Lit-Bel became the 8th government to control Vilnius in two years. During the month and a half that the Lit-Bel controlled the city, the new <b>communist</b> <b>government</b> turned Vilnius into a social experiment, testing various applications of left-leaning governmental systems on the city's inhabitants.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Yugoslavia's new <b>communist</b> <b>government</b> {{announced}} that Sajmište had held {{a total of}} 100,000 prisoners during the war, half of whom were killed. The Yugoslav State War Crimes Commission later estimated {{that as many as}} 40,000 may {{have been killed in the}} camp, including 7,000 Jews. According to the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia, the overall death toll was greatly exaggerated by the communists for political purposes, and the real number of inmates was about 50,000, with 20,000 killed. It is estimated that half of all Serbian Jews were killed at Sajmište. The Staro Sajmište memorial estimates that 23,000 people perished in the camp, of whom 10,000 were Jews.|$|E
5|$|Czechoslovakia's {{hardline}} <b>communist</b> <b>government</b> {{agreed to}} close its border with East Germany to choke off the exodus. The closure produced uproar across East Germany and the GDR government's bid to humiliate refugees by expelling them from the country in sealed trains backfired disastrously. Torn-up identity papers and East German passports littered the tracks as the refugees threw {{them out of the}} windows. When the trains passed through Dresden, 1,500East Germans stormed the main railway station in an attempt to board. Dozens were injured and the station concourse was virtually destroyed.|$|E
5|$|During Lê Duẩn's China {{visit in}} June 1973, Zhou {{told him that}} North Vietnam should adhere to the Paris Peace Accords. Following the signing, Lê Thanh Nghị stated that the {{direction}} of Vietnam's communism was directly linked to {{its relations with the}} Soviet Union. The Chinese opposed immediate reunification and to that end, began making economic agreements with the Provisional Revolutionary (<b>Communist)</b> <b>Government</b> of South Vietnam (PRGSV). PRGSV head Nguyễn Hữu Thọ was treated well by the Chinese. This policy further damaged relations. China and Vietnam drifted further apart; eventual Chinese aid did not improve relations.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, Jasienica (then, Leon Beynar) {{fought in}} the Polish Army, and later, the Home Army resistance. Near {{the end of the}} war, he was also working with the anti-Soviet resistance, which later led to him taking up a new name, Paweł Jasienica, to hide from the <b>communist</b> <b>government</b> of the People's Republic of Poland. He was {{associated}} with the Tygodnik Powszechny weekly and several other newspapers and magazines. He {{is best known for his}} 1960s books on Polish historyon the Kingdom of Poland under the Piast Dynasty, the Jagiellon Dynasty, and the elected kings of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Those books, still popular, played an important role in popularizing Polish history among several generations of readers.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, Albania {{became the}} world {{center of the}} Bektashi Order, a Muslim sect. The sect was {{headquartered}} in Tirana, and Gjirokastër was one of six districts of the Bektashi Order in Albania, with its center at the tekke of Baba Rexheb. The city retains a large Bektashi and Sunni population. Historically there were 15 and tekkes and mosques, of which 13 were functional in 1945. Only Gjirokastër Mosque has survived; the remaining 12 were destroyed or closed during the Cultural Revolution of the <b>communist</b> <b>government</b> in 1967.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 Kujau {{visited his}} family in East Germany and {{discovered}} {{that many of the}} locals held Nazi memorabilia, contrary to the laws of the <b>communist</b> <b>government.</b> He saw an opportunity to buy the material cheaply on the black market, and make a profit in the West, where the increasing demand among Stuttgart collectors was raising memorabilia prices up to ten times the amount he would pay. The trade was illegal in East Germany, and the export of what were deemed items of cultural heritage was banned. Among the items smuggled out of East Germany were weapons.|$|E

5|$|Karmal was {{appointed}} Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, synonymous with vice head of state, in the <b>communist</b> <b>government.</b> The Parchamite faction found itself under significant pressure by the Khalqists soon after taking power. In June 1978, a PDPA Central Committee meeting {{voted in favor}} of giving the Khalqist faction exclusive control over PDPA policy. This decision was followed by a failed Parchamite coup, after which Hafizullah Amin, a Khalqist, initiated a purge against the Parchamites. Karmal survived this purge but was exiled to Prague. Karmal remained in exile until December 1979, when the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan (with the consent of the Afghan government) to stabilize the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{fall of the}} {{communist}} regime marked {{a new chapter in}} the history of Poland and in the history of Solidarity. Having defeated the <b>communist</b> <b>government,</b> Solidarity found itself in a role it was much less prepared for — that of a political party — and soon began to lose popularity. Conflicts among Solidarity factions intensified. Wałęsa was elected Solidarity chairman, but support for him could be seen to be crumbling. One of his main opponents, Władysław Frasyniuk, withdrew from elections altogether. In September 1990, Wałęsa declared that Gazeta Wyborcza had no right to use the Solidarity logo.|$|E
5|$|The {{liberty of}} being {{employed}} in silk factories starting in 1865 allowed some women to style themselves tzu-shu nii (never to marry) {{and live in}} communes with other women. Other Chinese called them sou-hei (self-combers) for adopting hairstyles of married women. These communes passed because of the Great Depression and were subsequently discouraged by the <b>communist</b> <b>government</b> for being a relic of feudal China. In contemporary Chinese society, tongzhi (same goal or spirit) is the term {{used to refer to}} homosexuals; most Chinese are reluctant to divide this classification further to identify lesbians.|$|E
