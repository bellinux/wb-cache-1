Using a feedback system control scheme, we identified a unique combination of three small molecule inhibitors that enables the maintenance of hES cells on a fibronectin-coated surface through single <b>cell</b> <b>passaging.</b> After 20 passages, the undifferentiated state of the hES cells was confirmed by OCT 4, SSEA 4 and NANOG expressions, while their pluripotent potential and genetic integrity were demonstrated by teratoma formation and normal karyotype, respectively.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE. Development {{of liver}} {{metastasis}} {{remains the most}} common cause of mortality in uveal melanoma (UM). A few cell lines cultured from primary UM tumors have been used widely to investigate the pathobiology of UM. However, the translation of basic knowledge to the clinic for the treatment of the metastatic disease has remained incremental at best. In this study, we examined whether the properties of UM cell lines at various passages were similar to their corresponding primary tumors. METHODS. Gene expression profiling by microarray was performed on UM primary tumors and derived cell lines cultured at varying passages. Expression of UM protein markers was monitored by immunohistochemical analyses and Western blotting. The in vivo tumorigenic properties of UM cultures were evaluated using athymic nude mice. RESULTS. <b>Cell</b> <b>passaging</b> severely reduced the expression of genes encoding markers typical of UM, including those of the prognostic gene signature. Marked differences between gene expression profiles of primary tumors and cell lines could be linked to the infiltrating immune and stromal cells in situ. In addition, the tumorigenic properties of UM cell lines also increased with <b>cell</b> <b>passaging</b> in culture as evaluated by their subcutaneous injection into athymic mice. CONCLUSIONS. Together, these findings demonstrate that the short-term UM primary cultures exhibit molecular features that resemble the respective surgical material and, thus, represent the best model for in vitro-assessed cancer treatments...|$|E

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of infectious measles virus released from latently infected hamster embryo fibroblast cells are described. Low levels of virus were released spontaneously when the cultures were incubated at 37 C; this phenomenon was observed 19 <b>passages</b> after the <b>cells</b> {{had been exposed}} to the virus and has continued through <b>cell</b> <b>passage</b> 45. The virus yield could be significantly increased by cocultivation of the hamster cells with BSC- 1 cells or incubation of the latently infected cells at 33. 5 C rather than at 37 C. Measles virus released after cocultivation demonstrated increased cytopathology in cell culture and reduced temperature sensitivity when compared to the virus released at 33. 5 C. After <b>cell</b> <b>passage</b> 45, there was an increase in spontaneous release of virus. However, the viruses recovered by cocultivation or temperature release after <b>cell</b> <b>passage</b> 45 were nearly identical.

Hence, in C 6 cells cultured in serum-containing medium, SP cells can be generated from non-SP cells.

40|$|A {{systemic}} {{and quantitative}} study {{was performed to}} examine whether different levels of mitotic activities, assessed by the percentage of S-phase cells {{at any given time}} point, existed at different physical regions of human embryonic stem (hES) cell colonies at 2, 4, 6 days after <b>cell</b> <b>passaging.</b> Mitotically active cells were identified by the positive incorporation of 5 -bromo- 2 -deoxyuridine (BrdU) within their newly synthesized DNA. Our data indicated that mitotically active cells were often distributed as clusters randomly across the colonies within the examined growth period, presumably resulting from local deposition of newly divided cells. This latter notion was further demonstrated by the confined growth of enhanced green florescence protein (EGFP) expressing cells amongst non-GFP expressing cells. Furthermore, the overall percentage of mitotically active cells remained constantly at about 50 % throughout the 6 -day culture period, indicating mitotic activities of hES cell cultures were time-independent under current growth conditions...|$|E

The method of induction of human neural stem cells from embryonic stem cells was modified from what was described previously [28]. Stem cell induction began with hESCs UCSF- 4 cultured in mTesR media (STEMCELL) on Cellstart (Invitrogen) coating plates. UCSF- 4 cells were passaged by cutting colonies into small squares using StemPro EZPassage Disposable Stem <b>Cell</b> <b>Passaging</b> Tool (Gibco) at a dilution of 1 : 10.

Because acetylation of the histones on nuclear chromatin {{is an important}} aspect of gene activation, the present study in-vestigated the differences in histone acetylation of bovine fibro-blast and cumulus <b>cells</b> at various <b>passages</b> and cell-cycle stages. The acetylation was qualitatively analyzed by epifluorescent confocal microscopy and quantitatively by immunofluorescent flow cytometry. Specifically, we studied levels of histone H 4 acetylated at lysine 8 and histone H 3 acetylated at lysine 18; acetylation at these lysine residues is among the most common for these histone molecules. We also studied levels of linker his-tone H 1 in donor cells. Our results show that stage of cell cycle, cell type, and number of <b>cell</b> <b>passages</b> all had an effect on his-tone content. Histone H 1 and acetyl histone H 3 increased with <b>cell</b> <b>passage</b> (passages 5 – 15) in G 0 /G 1 - and G 2 /M-stage cumulus and fibroblast cells. We also found that acetyl histone H 4 was lower in early versus late <b>cell</b> <b>passages</b> (passage 5 vs. 15) for G 0 /G 1 -stage cumulus cells. In both cell types examined, acetyl histones increased with cell-cycle progression from G 0 /G 1 into the S and G 2 /M phases.

40|$|Human {{umbilical}} cord Wharton's jelly stem cells (HWJSCs) are gaining attention {{as a possible}} clinical source of mesenchymal stem cells for cell therapy and tissue engineering due to their high accessibility, expansion potential, and plasticity. We employed a combination of highly sensitive techniques to determine the average cell viability levels and proliferation capabilities of 10 consecutive <b>cell</b> <b>passages</b> of cultured HWJSCs and then used RNA microarrays to identify genes associated with changes in cell viability levels. We found an initial decrease in cell viability from the first to the third <b>cell</b> <b>passage</b> followed by an increase until the sixth passage and a final decrease from the sixth to tenth <b>cell</b> <b>passages.</b> The highest <b>cell</b> viability levels corresponded to the fifth and sixth passages. The intracellular ionic contents of potassium, sodium, and chlorine suggest that the lower cell viability levels at passages 2, 3, and 8 - 10 {{may be associated with}} apoptotic cell death. In fact, gene expression analysis revealed that the average cell viability was significantly associated with genes with a function in apoptotic cell death, especially pro-apoptotic FASTKD 2, BNIP 3 L genes and anti-apoptotic TNFAIP 8 and BCL 2 L 2 genes. This correlation with both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes suggests {{that there may be a}} complex live-death equilibrium in cultured HWJSCs kept in culture for multiple <b>cell</b> <b>passages.</b> In this study, the highest cell viability levels corresponded to the fifth and sixth HWJSC passages, suggesting that these passages should be preferentially employed in cell therapy or tissue engineering protocols using this cell type...|$|R
40|$|Cultures {{of human}} {{embryonic}} stem cell typically rely on protein matrices or feeder cells to support attachment and growth, while mechanical, enzymatic or chemical cell dissociation methods are used for cellular passaging. However, these methods are ill defined, thus introducing variability into the system, and may damage cells.

Here we report the identification {{of a family of}} chemically defined thermoresponsive synthetic hydrogels based on 2 -(diethylamino) ethyl acrylate, which support long-term {{human embryonic stem}} cell growth and pluripotency over a period of 2 – 6 months.

No positive selection was found in the matrix (M) gene from acute cases of MV and the effects of including hypermutated SSPE M gene sequences in phylogenetic inference were also explored.

40|$|We {{present a}} maximum {{likelihood}} (ML) {{analysis of the}} selection pressures that have shaped {{the evolution of the}} large (L) protein and the haemagglutinin (H) glycoprotein of measles virus (MV). A number of amino acid sites that have potentially been subject to adaptive evolution were identified in the H protein using sequences from every known genotype of MV. All but one of these putative positively selected sites reside within the ectodomain of the H protein, where they often show an association with positions of potential B-cell epitopes and sites known to interact with the CD 46 receptor. This suggests that MV may be under pressure from the immune system, albeit relatively weakly, to alter sites within epitopes and hence evade the humoral immune response. The positive selection identified at amino acid 546 was shown to correlate with the passage history of MV isolates in Vero cells. We reveal that Vero <b>cell</b> <b>passaging</b> has the potential to introduce an artificial signal of adaptive evolution through selection for changes that increase affinity for the CD 46 receptor. <br/...|$|E

However, there exist only a few in vitro models of both productive HPV infection and neoplastic progression on the same host background. We recently described a unique foreskin keratinocyte cell line (ERIN 59) that contains HPV 59 (a close relative of HPV 18). Early passages of ERIN 59 <b>cells</b> (<b>passages</b> 9 – 13) contained approximately 50 copies of episomes/cell, were feeder cell-dependent, and could be induced to differentiate and produce infectious virus in a simple culture system. We now report that late <b>passage</b> <b>cells</b> (<b>passages</b> greater than 50) were morphologically different from early <b>passage</b> <b>cells,</b> were feeder cell independent, and did not differentiate or produce virus.

Autologous chondrocyte implantation is a well-established method {{for the treatment}} of several chondral defects. However, very few studies have been carried out using human fibrous chondrocytes from the temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ). One of the main drawbacks associated to chondrocyte cell culture is the possibility that chondrocyte cells kept in culture tend to de-differentiate and to lose cell viability under in in-vitro conditions. In this work, we have isolated human temporo-mandibular joint fibrochondrocytes (TMJF) from human disc and we have used a highly-sensitive technique to determine cell viability, cell proliferation and gene expression of nine consecutive <b>cell</b> <b>passages</b> to determine the most appropriate <b>cell</b> <b>passage</b> for use in tissue engineering and future clinical use. Our results revealed that the most potentially viable and functional <b>cell</b> <b>passages</b> were P 5 ???P 6, in which an adequate equilibrium between cell viability and the capability to synthesize all major extracellular matrix components exists. The combined action of pro-apoptotic (TRAF 5, PHLDA 1) and anti-apoptotic genes (SON, HTT, FAIM 2) may explain the differential cell viability levels that we found in this study. These results suggest that TMJF should be used at P 5 ???P 6 for cell therapy protocols...|$|R

In this experiment, growth conditions are optimized for human intestinal stem cells— derived from patient samples—grown in a 3 -D matrigel environment. The method used for the optimization of growth factors, utilizes a Parabolic Response Surface (PRS) assisted by an Orthogonal Array Composite Design (OACD) to derive a second order equation that models spheroid growth, and aids in the discovery of the most efficient culture conditions. It was discovered that R-Spondin, the single most expensive component in culture, was able to be reduced by 50 % and still produce spheroid numbers similar to standard/conventional conditions.

40|$|Intimal {{smooth muscle}} cell {{accumulation}} {{is regarded as}} {{an important component of}} atherosclerotic plaque formation, angioplasty-induced restenosis, and vascular graft occlusion. Vascular smooth muscle cells can both express and respond to acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF); therefore, under certain conditions these polypeptides may regulate smooth muscle cell growth in an autocrine manner. Previous studies using smooth muscle cells cultured in vitro have identified factors that can enhance aFGF and bFGF gene expression. In this study, we assayed fibroblast growth factor gene expression in a spontaneously immortalized rabbit smooth muscle cell line. In contrast to "normal" rabbit smooth muscle cells, these immortalized cells acquire an altered morphology and enhanced proliferative rate during; <b>cell</b> <b>passaging</b> in vitro. Both "normal" and immortalized rabbit smooth muscle cells express bFGF but not aFGF transcripts. RNA gel blot hybridization, reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction amplification, and Western blotting techniques demonstrate that bFGF expression in the immortalized smooth muscle cell line increases as a function of passage level. This continuous cell line should prove valuable for studying both the regulation of bFGF synthesis and the control of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation...|$|E

40|$|Mutations in {{genes of}} various {{intermediate}} filament (IF) proteins are {{the causes of}} a wide range of diseases. For example, a premature aging disorder, Hutchinson-Gilbert progeria syndrome, is caused by mutation in the nuclear lamins. Mutations in a muscle-specific IF protein desmin cause a wide range of myofibrillar myopathies, and in severe cases cardiomyopathies. The effects of the desmin mutations vary with respect to the severity of their impact on its filament formation capacity. One of the observations on the tissue sections of the patients includes the occurrence of both apparently normal association of desmin filaments with Z-discs as well as the occurrence of desmin accumulations in the muscle cells of patients. However, the exact mechanisms leading to such phenotype remain unknown. The purpose of this PhD thesis was to analyse the effects of some of the known desmin mutations on cell differentiation. In addition, considering what appears to be concurrent occurrence of desmin aggregation and IFs formation as indicated above we aimed to determine to what extent are normal and mutant desmin proteins segregated in these cells. For that purpose, we have employed C 2 C 12 murine myoblast cell line for analyses of the impacts of desmin mutantions. As these cells can be induced to differentiate they are commonly used as a model in studies on muscle cells. Therefore, we have transfected genes of the normal human desmin (hDesWT) and some known desmin mutants into these cells. In order to detect the transfected protein antibodies specific for hDes were generated. Two desmin gene mutations were used for the analyses, namely hDesE 245 D and hDesR 350 P. Whereas the former desmin mutant was found to be incorporated into the IF-system of fibroblasts, the later segregates from it and accumulates in small aggregates through the cell. The analyses performed included cell fractionation and immuno-cytochemistry. hDesWT and hDesE 245 D mutant were predominantly found to incorporate into endogenous desmin IFs, whereas the extent of hDesR 350 P mutant incorporation into the filaments varied in the cell population. By subsequent <b>cell</b> <b>passaging</b> the number of hDesR 350 P-expressing cells was reduced, whereas both hDesWT and hDesE 245 D were still expressed to a similar extent. Subsequently transfected C 2 C 12 cells were induced to differentiate. Similarly to the observations in <b>cell</b> <b>passaging,</b> the amount of hDesR 350 P but not hDesWT or hDesE 245 D in cells was found to be reduced upon differentiation. Expression of a myosin heavy chain, a C 2 C 12 differentiation marker, was higher in cells expressing either of the mutants than in untransfected or the cells transfected with the hDesWT desmin. Finally, the transfected cells were subjected to immuno-cytochemical analyses with respect to the coexpression of myosin heavy chain and of the various transfected desmins.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{characterize}} mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) from human synovial membrane (SM). METHODS: Cell populations were enzymatically {{released from the}} SM obtained from knee joints of adult human donors and were expanded in monolayer with serial passages at confluence. Cell clones were obtained by limiting dilution. At different passages, SM-derived cells were subjected to in vitro assays to investigate their multilineage potential. Upon treatments, phenotypes of cell cultures were analyzed by histo- and immunohistochemistry and by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction {{for the expression of}} lineage-retated marker genes. RESULTS: SM-derived cells could be expanded extensively in monolayer, with limited senescence. Under appropriate culture conditions, SM-derived cells were induced to differentiate to the chondrocyte, osteocyte, and adipocyte lineages. Sporadic myogenesis was also observed. Five independent cell clones displayed multilineage potential. Interestingly, only 1 clone was myogenic. Donor age, <b>cell</b> <b>passaging,</b> and cryopreservation did not affect the multilineage potential of SM-derived cells. In contrast, normal dermal fibroblasts under the same culture conditions did not display this potential. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that human multipotent MSCs can be isolated from the SM of knee joints. These cells have the ability to proliferate extensively in culture, and they maintain their multilineage differentiation potential in vitro, establishing their progenitor cell nature. SM-derived MSCs {{may play a role in}} the regenerative response during arthritic diseases and are promising candidates for developing novel cell-based therapeutic approaches for postnatal skeletal tissue repair. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|DNA double-strand breaks are {{the most}} {{dangerous}} DNA lesions {{that may lead to}} massive loss of genetic information and cell death. Cells repair DSBs using two major pathways: nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). Perturbations of NHEJ and HR are often associated with premature aging and tumorigenesis, hence {{it is important to have}} a quantitative way of measuring each DSB repair pathway. Our laboratory has developed fluorescent reporter constructs that allow sensitive and quantitative measurement of NHEJ and HR. The constructs are based on an engineered GFP gene containing recognition sites for a rare-cutting I-SceI endonuclease for induction of DSBs. The starting constructs are GFP negative as the GFP gene is inactivated by an additional exon, or by mutations. Successful repair of the I-SceI-induced breaks by NHEJ or HR restores the functional GFP gene. The number of GFP positive cells counted by flow cytometry provides quantitative measure of NHEJ or HR efficiency. Protocol In this protocol we describe the method for analysis of DNA DSB repair with chromosomally integrated reporter constructs 1, 2 where DSBs are induced in vivo by transient expression a rare cutting endonuclease I-SceI 3. The integrated assay provides the advantage of analyzing DSB repair within the chromosomal context. However, this protocol requires prolonged <b>cell</b> <b>passaging,</b> which may be problematic when working with primary cells. An alternative approach is an extrachromosomal assay where reporter constructs are digested in vitro with I-SceI or HindIII endonucleases an...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that resistance and susceptibility to the 402 AX testicular teratocarcinoma are under genetic control in the mouse. Under normal culture conditions or when passaged in genetically susceptible hosts, the nullipotent 402 AX cells do not express H- 2 antigens. However, when passaged in genetically resistant animals, the tumor cells become strongly positive for H- 2 antigens in the absence of other indications of differentiation. These studies suggested that H- 2 antigen modulation on teratocarcinoma cells is mandatory for an effective host cell-mediated immune response against this tumor. The present studies further examine the role of H- 2 antigen modulation on teratocarcinoma cells and determine which host cell populations are mediating H- 2 modulation on the tumor cells. Reconstitution of lethally irradiated susceptible hosts with resistant bone marrow extends the mean survival time of the host but does not confer complete resistance. Teratocarcinoma <b>cells</b> <b>passaged</b> in such reconstituted hosts do not express H- 2 antigens. Two lines of evidence suggest that H- 2 antigen modulation is mediated by lymphoid cells: (i) sublethal irradiation of genetically resistant hosts inhibits H- 2 antigen modulation on teratocarcinoma <b>cells</b> <b>passaged</b> in vivo and (ii) immunological priming can overcome the loss of H- 2 modulation that is normally associated with aging in genetically resistant hosts. Genetically susceptible mice can be fully reconstituted for tumor rejection and H- 2 antigen expression on teratocarcinoma cells by reconstitution with genetically resistant bone marrow plus lymphoid cells from tumor-primed resistant hosts. These results: (i) imply the necessity for H- 2 antigens on tumor cells for an effective host cell-mediated immune response against the tumor, and (ii) indicate that host lymphoid cells regulate H- 2 antigen expression on tumor <b>cells</b> <b>passaged</b> in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) {{are able}} to {{differentiate}} into extramesodermal lineages, including neurons. Positive outcomes were obtained after transplantation of neurally induced MSCs in laboratory animals after nerve injury, but this is unknown in horses. Our objectives were to test the ability of equine MSCs to differentiate into cells of neural lineage in vitro, to assess differences in morphology and lineage-specific protein expression, and to investigate if horse age and <b>cell</b> <b>passage</b> number affected the ability to achieve differentiation. Bone marrow-derived MSCs were obtained from young and adult horses. Following demonstration of stemness, MSCs were neurally induced and microscopically assessed at different time points. Results showed that commercially available nitrogen-coated tissue culture plates supported proliferation and differentiation. Morphological changes were immediate and all the cells displayed a neural crest-like cell phenotype. Expression of neural progenitor proteins, was assessed via western blot or immunofluorescence. In our study, MSCs generated from young and middle-aged horses did not show differences {{in their ability to}} undergo differentiation. The effect of <b>cell</b> <b>passage</b> number, however, is inconsistent and further experiments are needed. Ongoing work is aimed at transdifferentiating these cells into Schwann cells for transplantation into a peripheral nerve injury model in horses...|$|R
