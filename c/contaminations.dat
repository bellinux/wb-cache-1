40|$|Background The {{origins of}} <b>contamination</b> fears are unknown {{although}} this might enhance interventions. Method Thirty people with OCD and <b>contamination</b> fears were interviewed about experiences involving direct, vicarious and informational learning routes. Results 29 reported contact <b>contamination</b> was, 17 mental <b>contamination</b> and 6 morphing fears. Mental <b>contamination</b> fears start around {{a mean of}} 15. 5 years (SD= 7. 8). Contact <b>contamination</b> preceded mental <b>contamination</b> in 9 cases, four described simultaneous onset, and two participants reported mental <b>contamination</b> first. Thirteen participants with mental <b>contamination</b> (76. 5 %) recalled a direct learning experience, often immoral acts, prior to symptom development. Three participants with mental <b>contamination</b> fears reported receiving threatening information. Of the 6, Three participants with morphing fears described a direct learning experience, the same proportion reported an occasion when they received threatening information, and one provided {{an example of a}} vicarious learning event. Conclusion Contact <b>contamination</b> tends to precede mental <b>contamination</b> and is associated with specific incidents. Mental <b>contamination</b> precedent events often involved immoral acts in which the person was the victim or perpetrator. This study is limited by a small sample size and retrospective method but provides an initial understanding of the origins of mental <b>contamination...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: Traditionally, fear of <b>contamination</b> {{research}} in OCD has involved physical <b>contamination,</b> where {{the sense of}} dirt arises from contact with clear and tangible contaminants (e. g., germs, dirt and harmful substances). More recently, however, it has been postulated that feelings of dirtiness and <b>contamination</b> can also arise {{in the absence of}} contact with a physical pollutant (termed mental <b>contamination).</b> However, to our knowledge, there are no studies that examined the relationship between mental <b>contamination,</b> disgust propensity and fear of <b>contamination.</b> The aims of this study were: 1) to investigate the presence of mental <b>contamination</b> in a sample of OCD patients; 2) to explore the association between mental <b>contamination,</b> disgust propensity and fear of <b>contamination</b> in a sample of OCD patients, controlling for anxiety and depression; 3) to analyze the role of mental <b>contamination</b> as a mediator in the relationship between disgust propensity and contamination-related symptoms. Method: 83 OCD patients completed a series of self-report questionnaires that included mental <b>contamination</b> (VOCI-MC), disgust propensity (DPQ), OCD symptoms (DOCS), anxiety (BAI) and depression (BDI-II). Results: Significant correlations were found between disgust propensity, mental <b>contamination</b> and fear of <b>contamination,</b> controlling for anxiety and depressive symptoms. Mediation analysis indicated that mental <b>contamination</b> played a role as mediator in the relationship between disgust propensity and fear of <b>contamination.</b> Conclusions: Our study provided preliminary evidence that disgust propensity play a role in arising mental <b>contamination</b> feelings, which is strongly related to fear of <b>contamination.</b> Clinical implication are discussed...|$|R

25|$|The United Nations {{estimated}} {{material damage}} from the revolutionary war to be US$480million. The FSLN took over a nation plagued by malnutrition, disease, and pesticide <b>contaminations.</b> Lake Managua was considered dead because of decades of pesticide runoff, toxic chemical pollution from lakeside factories, and untreated sewage. Soil erosion and dust storms were also a problem in Nicaragua at the time due to deforestation. To tackle these crises, the FSLN created the Nicaraguan Institute of Natural Resources and the Environment. It was created 10 years after the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 in the United States.|$|E

Back <b>contamination</b> is defined as <b>contamination</b> of the terrestrial biosphere with organisms or materials returned from outer space that are capable of potentially harmful terrestrial activity. Since {{the question of whether or}} not life exists on other planets may, in reality, not be answered until many samples are returned to earth for detailed study, requirements for the prevention of back <b>contamination</b> are necessary. A review of methods of microbiologic <b>contamination</b> control is followed by a discussion of the nature of back <b>contamination</b> and its risk levels, <b>contamination</b> sources and locations, and possible defenses against back <b>contamination.</b> The U.

25|$|Contaminants in a {{collection}} can pose a threat {{not only to the}} objects within the collection, but also to those individuals that come in contact with them. It is therefore necessary to ensure that all objects brought into {{a collection}} are carefully documented and researched to prevent accidental <b>contaminations,</b> and to create storage conditions, such as those mentioned above, to mitigate the potential for future contaminate development. Potential contaminants can take the form of gases, liquids, or solids and may therefore pollute objects, and the individuals caring for them, through airborne delivery or physical contact. Collections affected by contaminants will show signs of disintegration, discoloration, or corrosion, with porous materials being the most susceptible.|$|E
25|$|The Romanian popular costume {{finds its}} roots in the part of Thracian, Dacian and Getae {{ancestors}} and resembles with that of the peoples of the Balkan Peninsula, of course with differences consisting of decorative and colorful details. Between 7000 and 3500 BC was founded the belief in the one controlling power of the cosmos. Fabrics wore symbols appointed by virtue of faith, thus spinning and weaving became sacred. Therefore, were customary on the dresses the solar circle, the column of the sky, the rhomb, the hatch or the curved lines. Since 3500 BC and until year zero has passed from the sacred weaving to the vestment, the ritual reaching from the imposing space of the temple to the household hearth. The purpose of the garments worn by the ancestors was to facilitate dialogue with the unseen forces of the cosmos. Thus, it is still possible to talk about a civilization of sacred fabrics. For example, the thread of spun is column-shaped and spirally twisted, which increases the sacredness of the fabric. Also, having different colors is the most useful means for expressing feelings and behaviors. Popular clothes Carpatho-Danubian territory summarizes existential and spiritual dimension of Romanians, but component parts of clothes multiplied and the clothing became a costume. As a result, the autochthonous popular garment is a system of which developed the regional variations, through innovations and <b>contaminations</b> caused by each creator against the prototype schema.|$|E

2500|$|A polychlorinated {{biphenyl}} (PCB) is an {{organic chlorine compound}} with the formula C12H10−xClx. [...] Polychlorinated biphenyls were once widely deployed as dielectric and coolant fluids in electrical apparatus, carbonless copy paper and in heat transfer fluids. [...] Because of their longevity, PCBs are still widely in use, even though their manufacture has declined drastically since the 1960s, when a host of problems were identified. Because of PCBs' environmental toxicity and classification as a persistent organic pollutant, PCB production was banned by the United States Congress in 1979 and by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2001. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), rendered PCBs as definite carcinogens in humans.

2500|$|This edition, {{alternatively}} titled Biblia Sacra Vulgata or Biblia Sacra iuxta vulgatam versionem, is a [...] "manual edition" [...] in that {{it reduces}} {{much of the information}} in the large multivolume critical editions of Oxford and Rome into a handheld format, identifying the primary manuscript witnesses used by those editors to establish their texts (with some adjustments); and providing variant readings from the more significant early Vulgate manuscripts and printed editions. The first editions were published as two volumes, but the fourth (1994) and fifth (2007) editions were published as a single volume with smaller pages. The text reproduces and updates those of the Rome edition and the Oxford Edition for the Old Testament, Gospels, Acts and the earlier Pauline epistles; with changes mainly limited to standardisation of orthography. In the later New Testament books (those where the Oxford editors had retained the text of the 1911 editio minor), there are a greater number of critical changes. The text has not been modified substantially since the third edition of 1983, but the apparatus has been rewritten for many books in more recent editions, based for example on new findings concerning the Vetus Latina from the work of the Vetus Latina Institute, Beuron. Like the editions of Oxford and Rome, it attempts, through critical comparison of the most significant historical manuscripts of the Vulgate, to recreate an early text, cleansed of the scribal errors and scholarly <b>contaminations</b> of a millennium.
