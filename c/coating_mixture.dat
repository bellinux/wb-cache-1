The sphere body consists of 42 – 50 % sugar entrapped {{in a mixture of}} gelatinized corn flour and wheat flour in the presence of glycerin, and coated with a layer of latex paint containing insecticide. The sphere body serves as a slow-release sugar reservoir. ^ First, the lethal and sublethal toxicity and the effects of tree sprays of the new insecticide imidacloprid on apple maggot flies were investigated. Females tested in the laboratory showed great mortality and reduced fecundity regardless of whether exposure was by oral or by surface contact. However, foliar sprays resulted neither in significant mortality nor reduced fecundity over a 7 -day period. Secondly, technical-grade or formulated insecticides were incorporated in sphere <b>coating</b> <b>mixtures</b> and evaluated for acute toxicity and residual effectiveness in laboratory, semi-field and field experiments. Results indicated that imidacloprid is a promising substitute for dimethoate as a fly killing agent on spheres. A wettable powder formulation of imidacloprid (Merit) proved better than a flowable formulation (Provado) in terms of residual efficacy. ^ Females feeding on imidacloprid-treated spheres exhibited very little tendency to forage within host plants or to lay eggs before dying, compared with females tested on dimethoate-treated spheres and control spheres. ^ The sucrose pH shown to stimulate maximal feeding response was 6. 4, with little feeding occurring at pH values of 5. 0 or less and 8. 0 or greater. Males were more responsive to varying pH than females. Such information is relevant to formulation improvements of <b>coating</b> <b>mixtures</b> of sucrose and insecticide applied to lethal spheres as part of tephritid fly control programs.

The degree of crosslinking in these coatings is typically assessed via optical spectroscopy; unfortunately, optical methods are typically limited in their maximum depth access.

40|$|Recently, {{patterned}} polystyrene surfaces containing hydrophobic (PS) {{and more}} hydrophilic (PSox) {{areas have been}} shown to be capable of directing cellular growth, which is mainly due to the competitive adsorption of adhesive and antiadhesive molecules.

Radiolabeling and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques showed that fibronectin adsorption increased on both surfaces if the fibronectin concentrations increased in the conditioning mixture. In contrast, fibronectin adsorption decreased on PSox and did not occur on PS surfaces when pluronic concentrations increased in the <b>coating</b> <b>mixture.</b> A comparison of these data with pheochromocytoma and Schwann cells cultured on patterned surfaces showed that the direction of cell growth on PSox areas depended first on the relative concentrations of the two components in the mixtures, and second, on their ratio; the best concentration ratio probably depends on the cell's ability to recondition its support...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the stability of anthocyanin colorant with and without ferulic acid (FA) stabilising agent in a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) binder coating system. Design/methodology/approach - The anthocyanin colorant was extracted using methanol acidified with 0. 5 trifluoroacetic acid (TEA). FA was added to improve thermal stability of the colorant. The FA added colorant was mixed with PVA to develop a coating system. To test the ability of the <b>coating</b> <b>mixture</b> to withstand heat in the liquid state, spectroscopic studies were carried out in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum when the liquid samples had cooled down to room temperature after being heated at 80 and 90 degrees C for 30 minutes. This procedure was repeated six times until a total heating time of 180 minutes has been accomplished. The liquid samples were also coated on glass slides, cured and then stored in different incubators at 30, 40 and 50 degrees C. The visible spectrum was taken everyday for 30 days to study the effect of storage temperature. Spectroscopic results were analysed in terms of intensity rate percentage (IRP). Findings - In the liquid state, the anthocyanin-PVA mixture without FA showed lower absorbance compared to the mixture containing FA after heating at 80 and 90 degrees C. This shows that FA can enhance the intensity of absorbance of the liquid <b>coating</b> <b>mixture.</b> The mixtures containing FA show increase in absorbance with increase in heating time. The same results are obtained for the coating on glass substrate where FA containing coatings show increase in IRP with time for all storage temperatures. Coating with 1 FA content showed better enhancement and stability. Research limitations/implications - The colour of the untreated samples quickly faded during heating and storage at different temperatures. In this study, the addition of 0. 5 and 1 FA stabilised and enhanced the colour intensity at 30, 40 and 50 degrees C. Further improvements may find the mixture suitable as paint or coating materials and as nail varnish. Practical implications - The results indicate the possibility of applying the FA stabilised anthocyanin-PVA, colorant-binder composition in a coating system. Originality/value - The use of anthocyanin from M. Malabathricum as a colourant in a coating system or nail varnish is original. Anthocyanin pigments are normally used as colorant in foods...|$|E

The incorporation was achieved through the reaction involving epoxide group of ENR and COOH group of alkyd.
