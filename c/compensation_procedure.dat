40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{replication}} protocol - PRiDe - is presented, which supports optimistic replication in distributed real-time databases with deterministic detection and forward resolution of transaction conflicts. The protocol {{is designed to}} emphasize node autonomy, allowing individual applications to proceed without being affected by distributed operation. For conflict management, PRiDe groups distributed operations into generations of logically concurrent and potentially conflicting operations. Conflicts between operations in a generation can be resolved with no need for coordination among nodes, and it is shown that nodes eventually converge to mutually consistent states. A generic framework for conflict resolution is presented that allows semantics-based conflict resolution policies and application-specific <b>compensation</b> <b>procedures</b> to be plugged in by the database designer and application developer. It is explained how transaction semantics are supported by the protocol, and how applications can tolerate exposure to temporary database inconsistencies. Transactions can detect inconsistent reads and compensate for inconsistencies through callbacks to application-specific <b>compensation</b> <b>procedures.</b> A tool - VADer - has been constructed, which allows database designers and application programmers to quickly construct prototype applications, conflict resolution policies and <b>compensation</b> <b>procedures.</b> VADer {{can be used to}} simulate application and database behavior, and supports run-time visualization of relationships between concurrent transactions. Thus, VADer assists the application programmer in conquering the complexity inherent in optimistic replication and forward conflict resolution...|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} Treaty of Chaguaramas had prescribed that {{member states}} explore ways of harmonizing their monetary, exchange rate and payments {{policies in the}} interest of smooth functioning of the Common Market. Up to the late 1970s the various CARICOM countries established a <b>compensation</b> <b>procedure</b> to favour the use of the member states currencies. The procedure was aimed at ensuring monetary stability and promoting trade development. This monetary compensation scheme (or Intra-Regional Payments Scheme) was at first bilateral, but although it worked fairly well for about eight years it was limited, cumbersome and unwieldy as each participant had to keep individual accounts for all the other participants and the accounts had to be individually balanced {{at the end of each}} credit period. In addition, the bilateral arrangements did not produce meaningful economies in the use of foreign exchange. The system finally became multilateral in 1977 and was called the CARICOM Multilateral Clearing Facility (CMCF). The CMCF was supposed to favour the use of internal CARICOM currencies for transaction settlement and to promote banking cooperation and monetary cooperation between member states. Each country was allowed a fixed credit line and initially the CMCF was successful enough that both the total credit line and the credit period were extended by 1982. With the CMCF in place, intraregional trade doubled between 1978 and 1981, and the use of the credit facility of the CMCF expanded from US$40 million to US$100 million. However, the CMCF failed shortly thereafter in the early 1980s due to Guyana's inability to settle its debts and Barbados being unable to grant new payment terms ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{mathematical}} and physical models {{to be used}} in the analysis of the problem of intonation of musical instruments such as guitars, mandolins and the like, i. e., we study how to improve the tuning on these instruments. This analysis begins by designing the placement of frets on the fingerboard according to mathematical rules and the assumption of an ideal string, but becomes more complicated when one includes the effects of deformation of the string and inharmonicity due to other string characteristics. As a consequence of these factors, perfect intonation of all the notes on the instrument can never be achieved, but complex <b>compensation</b> <b>procedures</b> are introduced and studied to minimize the problem. To test the validity of these <b>compensation</b> <b>procedures,</b> we have performed extensive measurements using standard monochord sonometers and other basic acoustical devices, confirming the correctness of our theoretical models. In particular, these experimental activities can be easily integrated into standard acoustics courses and labs, and can become a more advanced version of basic experiments with monochords and sonometers.

40|$|The {{queueing}} {{problem with a}} Poisson arrival stream and two identical Erlang servers is analysed for the queueing discipline based on shortest expected delay. This {{queueing problem}} may be represented as a random walk on the integer grid in the first quadrant of the plane. In the paper it is shown that the equilibrium distribution of this random walk can be written as a countable linear combination of product forms. This linear combination is constructed in a <b>compensation</b> <b>procedure.</b> In this case the <b>compensation</b> <b>procedure</b> is essentially more complicated than in other cases where the same idea was exploited. The reason for the complications is {{that in this case}} the boundary consists of several layers which in turn is caused by the fact that transitions starting in inner states are not restricted to end in neighbouring states. Good starting solutions for the <b>compensation</b> <b>procedure</b> are found by solving the shortest expected delay problem with the same service distributions but with instantaneous jockeying.

40|$|The {{challenges}} {{associated with}} determining fair compensation for expropriated land have been extensively discussed and debated among scholars, practitioners, policymakers, and the public. However, to date, a {{comprehensive study of}} national-level <b>compensation</b> <b>procedures</b> established by law considering whether such procedures meet internationally recognized standards on compensation valuation has not been conducted. This article aims to {{bridge this gap by}} serving as a reference point and informing “fair compensation” debates among scholars, practitioners, and policymakers. This article examines national-level legal provisions on compensation in 50 countries/regions across Asia, Africa, and Latin America against a set of legal indicators that are based on international standards on the valuation of compensation. The legal indicators focus on the substantive and procedural requirements pertaining to the calculation of compensation. The indicators ask whether laws require assessors to account for various land values when calculating compensation, and whether there are legal processes in place that allow affected persons to negotiate compensation amounts, receive prompt payments, and hold governments accountable by appealing compensation decisions in courts or before tribunals. The results of the study show that most of the 50 countries/regions assessed do not have national laws that comply with internationally recognized standards on the valuation of compensation. Based on the findings from the legal indicator analysis, this paper presents a set of recommendations for reforming <b>compensation</b> <b>procedures</b> to bring them into conformity with international standards...|$|R
