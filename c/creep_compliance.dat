The test is particularly valuable in that the <b>creep</b> <b>compliance</b> was independent of load, allowing the mechanical properties to be represented by a single total <b>creep</b> <b>compliance</b> curve which can be used to determine the various creep components.

40|$|A {{conduct of}} {{physical}} aging in polymeric composites was investigated. A carbon/epoxy composite IM 7 / 977 - 3 {{was used for}} this study. Momentary creep {{test was used to}} characterize physical aging in elastic and creep compliances, respectively. Experimental data showed that physical aging affects elastic and creep compliances in different ways. The aging effect on elastic compliance can be modeled by an exponential function of aging time. For individual momentary creep, physical aging was negligible. In different aging time, momentary <b>creep</b> <b>compliance</b> decreased as aging time increased. Using aging shift factors, momentary creep compliances in different aging times were shifted and collapsed into a reference curve. Using this reference curve associated with the aging shift, a momentary <b>creep</b> <b>compliance</b> curve for any given aging time can be predicted. ^ An effective time model was developed to characterize physical aging in long-term creep behavior. The real creep time was replaced by the effective time, which counted aging effect on shift factors in power law model. ^ An effective <b>creep</b> <b>compliance</b> model was developed to characterize physical aging in orthotropic composites. By using a one-parameter creep potential function, momentary creep compliances with different fiber orientations were collapsed into a single master curve. By using the aging shift method and effective time model, long-term effective <b>creep</b> <b>compliance</b> for times up to 100 times of the initial aging time was successfully predicted. ^ Moisture and temperature can proportionally relax the elastic compliance throughout the period of aging and creep tests. In a given aging time, the increment of <b>creep</b> <b>compliance</b> due to moisture absorption becomes smaller as moisture content increases and reaches saturation. But, the increment of <b>creep</b> <b>compliance</b> due to temperature becomes larger as ambient temperature increases. For a constant moisture content or ambient temperature, momentary <b>creep</b> <b>compliance</b> in different aging times can be shifted by using aging shift factors to collapse into a reference curve. By choosing a condition of 23 °C and 0 % moisture content as reference, moisture-temperature equivalences in physical aging of elastic and creep compliances were developed, respectively. ^ Classical laminate theory was adopted to characterize physical aging in elastic compliance of composite laminates by replacing constant elastic properties by aging dependent elastic properties. However, laminate theory is not applicable to characterize physical aging in <b>creep</b> <b>compliance.</b> To this effect, momentary creep tests for laminates were employed. The aging shift factors for relaxation time and shape factor were obtained.

40|$|The linear {{viscoelastic}} behaviour of isotropic materials {{under three}} dimensional stress distributions is treated {{by means of a}} generalised superposition principle, which yields the state of stress under known strain history and vice versa. The material is completely characterised mechanically, if two independent characteristic material functions are determined. As such we may choose: 1. the <b>creep</b> <b>compliances</b> in simple shear, isotropic compression and linear extension J(t), B(t) and F(t) (monotonously increasing functions of time). 2. the stress relaxation moduli in simple shear, isotropic compression and linear extension G(t), K(t) and E(t) (monotonously decreasing functions of time), 3. a time dependent Poisson's ratio v(t) (varying unrestrictedly between 0 and 1 / 2). The relationships between these functions are given. The shear modulus G(t) as well as the bulk K(t) may show independent dispersion regions. A dispersion in the shear modulus without dispersion in the bulk modulus leads to an increase in Poisson's ratio, a dispersion in the bulk modulus without dispersion in the shear modulus would lead to a decrease in Poisson's ratio. If the "relaxation strengths" in shear modulus and bulk modulus are equal, Poisson's ratio remains constant. From the consideration of the experimental facts on high polymers known to day, it is emphasized that a transition region in shear modulus will generally be accompanied by an increase in Poisson's ratio and may perhaps be followed by a slight relaxation of the bulk modulus. © 1956 Verlag von Dr. Dietrich Steinkopff...|$|R

Biofilms consist of structured communities of cells encapsulated in matrix materials, and are frequently responsible for clinical infections. We found that Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm microstructure is heterogeneous in both unstressed and stressed (NaCl and sub-lethal vancomycin) conditions. Unstressed biofilms contained high-, medium-, and low-density phenotypes, and stressed biofilms had medium- and low-density phenotypes. High-density biofilms contained densely packed, disordered structures, while low-density biofilms contained open, porous structures. We used our understanding of microstructure to create bacterial-chitosan constructs with high- and low-density phenotypes and <b>creep</b> <b>compliances</b> matching natural biofilms through self-assembly of cells and chitosan at pH > 7. The phase instability of chitosan controlled the mechanical behavior of these constructs. We compared the phase instability of chitosan to that of S. epidermidis biofilm matrix materials. Chitosan was unstable at pH > 7, while matrix materials were unstable at pH 7. S. aureus biofilms also softened at pH > 7. We extended our work on biofilm structure by investigating structure of multispecies biofilms of S. aureus and S. epidermidis. In multispecies biofilms, S. aureus is the dominant species in unstressed conditions (pH 7, 37 °C), at high pH (8, 9) and at high temperature (45 °C). S. epidermidis is the dominant species when multispecies biofilms are grown at low pH (5) and in 1. 0 μg/mL vancomycin. We also investigated a label-free method for imaging S. epidermidis biofilm microstructure. We found that cellular microstructure was revealed using confocal Raman microscopy when samples were thin. Overall, our understanding of biofilm microstructure aids in understanding their mechanical properties and provides ground for development of biofilm control strategies or theoretical models of biofilms.

40|$|Viscoelastic {{behavior}} of most polymeric materials is nonlinear over {{a major portion}} of the interval of their response to external forces. The phenomenological the-ory of viscoelasticity, {{based on the assumption that}} mo-lecular (segmental) motions are controlled by available fractional free volume f, was found adequate for descrip-tion of the nonlinear tensile creep, implementation of the time–strain superposition and prediction of the nonlinear creep of studied blends. As f of thermoplastics with Poisson’s ratio smaller than 0. 5 rises proportionally to tensile strain, advancing creep accounts for shortening of retardation times. Consequently, the shift factor along the internal time scale in the time–strain superposition is not constant for a creep curve, but monotonically rises with the elapsed <b>creep</b> time. <b>Compliance</b> curves for var-ious stresses obey fairly well the internal time–strain superposition forming a generalized compliance curve related to an iso-free volume reference state.

Because biological control mechanisms have evolved to deal with such problems, we investigated whether a control scheme based on the cerebellum would be useful for controlling a nonlinear dielectric elastomer actuator, a class of artificial muscle. The cerebellum was represented by the adaptive filter model, and acted in parallel with a brainstem, an approximate inverse plant model. The recurrent connections between the two allowed for direct use of sensory error to adjust motor commands. Accurate tracking of a displacement command in the actuator’s nonlinear range was achieved by either semi-linear basis functions in the cerebellar model or semi-linear functions in the brainstem corresponding to recruitment in biological muscle. In addition, allowing transfer of training between cerebellum and brainstem as has been observed in the vestibulo-ocular reflex prevented the steady increase in cerebellar output otherwise required to deal with creep. The extensibility and relative simplicity of the cerebellar-based adaptive-inverse control scheme suggests that it is a plausible candidate for controlling this type of actuator.

The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of simple shear deformation at various shear rates on wheat dough rheological properties, microstructure and GMP fraction. Shear processing was compared with a z-blade mixing. The contribution of disulfide bonds on different length scales was investigated using NEMI as SH-blocker agent. Dough strength and strain hardening decreased with the increase in shear rate leading to dough weakening. Sheared dough at low shear rate exhibited the highest strength among doughs under large deformation conditions. Mixing or shearing in the presence of NEMI strongly reduced fracture properties and GMP content of mixed and sheared doughs. Only the dough that was sheared at low shear rate still exhibited some strength and strain hardening.

Elastic <b>compliance</b> curves for reference doughs were lower than the dough containing NEMI. Shearing at low and intermediate shear rates gave similar elastic compliance. Dough rheological behaviour was interpreted in the context of polymer gels containing reversible cross-links and physical interactions. Shearing {{led to the formation of}} a heterogeneous structure. Very large protein domains were observed for dough at low shear rate, which became smaller upon higher shear rates suggesting that those structures are quite weak. When NEMI was present, large protein structures were lost more easily. The break-up of gluten domains during mixing and shearing was proposed to be a result from a different mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Rheological {{properties}} of solder pastes {{are very important}} for a high quality surface mount technology process. The stencil/screen printing process of solder pastes {{is one of the}} most critical steps in the SMT assembly process, as most of the assembly defects can often be shown to originate from paste rheology and associated poor printing performance. This paper concerns an investigation of the effect of solder paste composition on the rheological properties and behaviour of four different solder pastes. We report on the evaluation of three different paste formulations based on the no-clean flux composition, with different alloy composition, metal content and particle size using a range of rheological characterisation techniques - including viscosity measurements, yield stress, oscillatory and creep-recovery tests. Our results show that in the viscosity test, all solder pastes exhibited a shear thinning behaviour in nature with different highest maximum viscosity. In the region of shear thinning behaviour the paste 3 delivered the best results. Viscosity test helps to understand the solid and cohesive behaviour of solder pastes. Good solid and cohesive behaviour indicates a good paste roll and helps to avoid paste bleeding. The yield stress test has been used to study the effect of temperature on the flow behaviour of solder pastes. Yield stress was measured for a range of temperature from 15 deg C to 35 deg C with an increment of 5 degC. The result indicated a decreasing of the yield stress point if the temperature was increased. Paste 4 has shown the minimum dependence on temperature. The oscillatory test has been used to find out the linear visco-elastic range and to study the solid and liquid like behaviours of solder pastes. Paste 1 indicated the biggest linear visco-elastic region (LVR) and the highest value of G' and G" which means solder paste 1 will be needed a higher squeegee pressure in the printing process. In the creep recovery test paste 4 showed the best- - recovery and the lowest values of <b>creep</b> and recovery <b>compliance</b> which indicated a good printing behaviour. The test also has showed the solder paste with smaller particle size exhibit less recover...|$|R
40|$|Here we {{describe}} an {{experimental study of}} the mechanical properties of bacterial biofilms formed from the early dental plaque colonizer Streptococcus mutans. The S. mutans biofilms demonstrated the behavior of rheological fluids, with properties {{similar to those of}} organic polymers and other biological fluids. The time-dependent response of the biofilms was modeled on the basis of principles of viscoelasticity theory. The static and dynamic responses were defined in terms of the <b>creep</b> <b>compliance,</b> storage and loss moduli, and viscosity. The <b>creep</b> <b>compliance</b> and stress relaxation functions of S. mutans biofilms were characterized using the Burger model. Implications for developing more effective mechanical removal strategies of dental plaque biofilms are discusse...|$|E
