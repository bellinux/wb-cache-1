Pearson (1897) {{investigated}} <b>correlations</b> of <b>ratios</b> of bone {{measurements and}} found that although the correlations among the original measures were low, the correla-tions among ratios with common measures were about. 5. To understand this result, he developed an approximate equation for the <b>correlations</b> of <b>ratios.</b> In the present study, Monte Carlo methods were used to show that Pearson's equation is fairly accurate and that <b>correlations</b> among <b>ratios</b> with common elements (e. g., XIC, YIC) are indeed at least part-ly spurious, as Pearson concluded. This finding {{should serve as a}} two-fold warning to those who might correlate ratios that have common elements: (a) Interpretation of the observed relationship between such ratios may at best be tenuous, and (b) the relationships among the elements themselves may call into question the usefulness of addressing a hypothesis that can be tested only with a <b>correlation</b> between <b>ratios</b> that share elements. RATIO VARIABLES (sometimes called index variables) are formed by dividing one variable into another (Cohen & Cohen, 1983, p. 73).

40|$|A {{practical}} and accurate generalized in vivo dosimetry procedure has been implemented for Siemens linacs supplying 6, 10, and 15 MV photon beams, equipped with aSi electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs).

The s (t) (0) (TPR,w,L) and D (0) (TPR,w,L) values were defined to be independent of the EPID sensitivity and monitor unit calibration, while their dependence on TPR(20, 10) was investigated to determine a set of generalized <b>correlation</b> <b>ratios</b> {{to be used for}} beams with TPR(20, 10) falling in the examined range.
