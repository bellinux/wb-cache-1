However, the ban on characterising flavours was not extended to cigars. Methods This study reviewed industry documents from Kretek International, the parent company behind Djarum clove cigars, to document the changes in their marketing and production strategies following the <b>flavour</b> ban on <b>cigarettes.</b> To assess sales trends following the ban, data for clove cigar sales in the USA from 2009 to 2012 were analysed using Nielsen’s Convenience Track retail scanner database.

40|$|Abstract Background Very {{few studies}} have {{evaluated}} the adverse effect of passive smoking exposure among active smokers, {{probably due to the}} unproven assumption that the dose of toxic compounds that a smoker inhales by passive smoke is negligible compared to the dose inhaled by active smoke. Methods In a controlled situation of indoor active smoking, we compared daily benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) dose, estimated to be inhaled by smokers due to the mainstream (MS) of cigarettes they have smoked, to the measured environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) they inhaled in an indoor environment. For this aim, we re-examined our previous study on daily personal exposure to BaP of thirty newsagents, according to their smoking habits. Results Daily BaP dose due to indoor environmental contamination measured inside newsstands (traffic emission and ETS produced by smoker newsagents) was linearly correlated (p = 0. 001 R 2 = 0. 62) with estimated BaP dose from MS of daily smoked cigarettes. In smoker subjects, the percentage of BaP daily dose due to ETS, in comparison to mainstream dose due to smoked cigarettes, was estimated with 95 % confidence interval, between 14. 6 % and 23 % for full <b>flavour</b> <b>cigarettes</b> and between 21 % and 34 % for full <b>flavour</b> light <b>cigarettes.</b> Conclusions During indoor smoking, ETS contribution to total BaP dose of the same smoker, may be not negligible. Therefore both active and passive smoking exposures should be considered in studies about health of active smokers. </p...|$|R

50|$|The {{essential}} {{ingredients of}} liquorice confectionery are liquorice extract, sugar, and a binder. The base is typically starch/flour, gum arabic, gelatin {{or a combination}} thereof. Additional ingredients are extra flavouring, beeswax for a shiny surface, ammonium chloride and molasses. Ammonium chloride is mainly used in salty liquorice candy, with concentrations up to about 8 percent. However, even regular liquorice candy can contain up to 2 percent ammonium chloride, the taste of which is less prominent due to the higher sugar concentration. Some liquorice <b>candy</b> is <b>flavoured</b> with anise oil instead of or in combination with liquorice root extract.|$|R

50|$|Cigarettes labeled as Lights, Milds, or Low-tar, are {{considered}} to have a lighter, less pronounced <b>flavour</b> than regular <b>cigarettes.</b> These cigarette brands may also contain lower levels of tar, nicotine, or other chemicals inhaled by the smoker. However, the scientific evidence is that switching from regular to light or low-tar cigarettes does not reduce the health risks of smoking or lower the smoker's exposure to the nicotine, tar, and carcinogens present in cigarette smoke.|$|R
50|$|Trousseau or Trousseau Noir, {{also known}} as Bastardo, is an old variety of red wine grape {{originating}} in eastern France.

It makes deep cherry red wines with high alcohol and high, sour <b>candy</b> acidity, and <b>flavours</b> of red berry fruits, often complemented - depending on production - by a jerky nose and an organic, mossy minerality.|$|R
30|$|Radioiodine {{treatment}} of differentiated thyroid cancer {{has been proven}} highly effective; however, application of high 131 I activity {{has been found to}} be associated with side effects. Organs at risk in high-activity radioiodine therapies are the bone marrow and the lung [1],[2]. In addition, the parotid and submandibular glands may also be affected by high-activity radioiodine therapies, which may cause sialadenitis and xerostomia [3]. The radioiodine uptake in (major) salivary glands is mediated by the sodium-iodide symporter [4]. Sialadenitis appears transiently, but in particular, xerostomia can persist for an entire lifetime and may severely affect the patient's quality of life. For more than almost 30 years, radioprotective procedures have been proposed to mitigate damage to the salivary glands [5]. The use of sialogogic agents such as lemon juice, sour <b>candies,</b> and <b>flavoured</b> chewing gums is recommended [1],[5]. The reasoning is based on the grounds that salivary gland stimulation after 131 I administration reduces the radiation exposure time (residence time). Hence, radiogenic damage is thought to be reduced by increase of salivary flow.|$|R
5|$|Even {{though most}} {{consumer}} items {{are in short}} supply in North Korea, there is a considerable variety of cigarettes available. In general, strong tobacco is preferred, and filters are rare. Western brands, particularly American, but also Chinese, Russian and Japanese are popular with the elite and preferred over domestic cigarettes. Foreign cigarettes and the domestic 727 brand, whose name stands for 27 July, the date of the Korean Armistice Agreement, are veritable status symbols. Menthol cigarettes are virtually non-existent, but there is competition among tobacco companies to introduce other attractive products, such as fruit-flavoured balls inside the filter to give the <b>cigarette</b> <b>flavour.</b>|$|R

40|$|Aroma {{release of}} two {{strawberry}} flavourings (one natural-NS and one nature-identical-NIS) at different concentration (0. 15 %, 0. 30 %) added to gummy candies made of pectin, gum arabic and gelatine as structuring agents was studied by gas chromatography/mass-spectrometry (GC-MS) and electronic nose (e-nose) equipped with two {{different sets of}} sensors to characterise and differentiate the products. By using GC-MS, different aroma patterns of the pure NS and NIS flavouring were obtained.
