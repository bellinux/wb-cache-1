5|$|Draught <b>camel</b> {{are used}} for several {{purposes}} including ploughing, processing in oil mills and pulling carts. There is no clear description for the ideal draught <b>camel,</b> though its strength, its ability to survive without water and the flatness of its feet could be indicators. It {{may be used for}} ploughing in pairs or in groups with buffaloes or bullocks. The draught <b>camel</b> can plough at around , and should not be used for more than six hours a day four hours in the morning and two in the afternoon. The <b>camel</b> is not easily exhausted unless diseased or undernourished, and has remarkable endurance and hardiness.|$|E
5|$|The {{landings}} were overwhelmingly successful. On Delta and Alpha beaches, German {{resistance was}} low. The Osttruppen surrendered quickly, {{and the biggest}} threat to the Allies were the mines. A single German gun as well as a mortar position were silenced by destroyer fire. The Allied units in this sector were able to secure a bridgehead and quickly linked up with the paratroopers, capturing Saint-Tropez as well LeMuy. The most serious fighting was on <b>Camel</b> Beach near the town of Saint-Raphaël. This beach was secured by several well-emplaced coastal guns as well as flak batteries. Through heavy German fire the Allies attempted to land at the shore. However, at sector Red of the <b>Camel</b> Beach landing zone the Allies were not able to succeed. A bombing run of 90Allied B-24 bombers was called in against a German strongpoint here. Even with the assistance of naval fire, the Allies were not able to bring the landing ships close to the shore. They decided to avoid <b>Camel</b> Red and land only at the sectors of <b>Camel</b> Blue and <b>Camel</b> Green, which was successful.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of age and sex on the concentration of total serum protein measured by the biuret method and protein fractions determined using cellulose acetate electrophoresis in apparently healthy <b>camels</b> (Camelus dromedarius). Blood samples were collected from 21 <b>camels</b> (12 males and 9 females). The <b>camels</b> were further divided into two groups: 12 young <b>camels</b> at the age of 3 months to 2 years and 9 adult <b>camels</b> at the age of 3 - 15 years. Cellulose acetate electrophoresis of serum proteins identified five protein fractions in adult <b>camels</b> as young <b>camels,</b> these five protein fractions include albumin, α 1 and α 2, β and γ-globulins. In adult <b>camels,</b> serum levels (g/l) of total protein, albumin, α 1 -globulins, α 2 -globulins, β-globulins and γ-globulins were 80. 9 ± 3. 10, 42. 9 ± 3. 10, 1. 3 ± 0. 22, 2. 2 ± 0. 30, 11. 8 ± 0. 30 and 22. 6 ± 0. 20, respectively. However, in young <b>camels,</b> these levels (g/l) were 66. 8 ± 2. 90, 40. 2 ± 2. 40, 1. 0 ± 0. 14, 2. 6 ± 0. 30, 10. 6 ± 0. 80 and 12. 3 ± 1. 20, respectively. The albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio was 2. 08 ± 0. 28 in adult <b>camels</b> and 3. 77 ± 0. 53 in young ones. The mean serum concentrations of total protein and γ-globulins were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher and the A/G ratio was significantly lower in adult <b>camels</b> compared to young <b>camels.</b> The mean concentrations of γ-globulins were significantly higher and the A/G ratio was significantly (P< 0. 05) lower in females compared to male <b>camels.</b> The results of the present study indicate a significant effect of age and sex on the concentrations of some of the serum protein fractions in dromedary <b>camels...</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Camel</b> {{hybridisation}} {{began in}} the first millennium BC. For about a thousand years, Bactrian camels and dromedaries have been successfully bred in regions where they are sympatric to form hybrids with either a long, slightly lopsided hump or two humps – one small and one large. These hybrids are larger and stronger than their parents – they can bear greater loads. A cross between a first generation female hybrid and a male Bactrian <b>camel</b> can also produce a hybrid. Hybrids from other combinations tend to be bad-tempered or runts.|$|E

5|$|Horses occur {{naturally}} on the steppes of Central Asia, {{and their}} domestication, around 3,000 BC in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea region, was originally {{as a source}} of meat; use as pack animals and for riding followed. Around the same time, the wild ass was being tamed in Egypt. Camels were domesticated soon after this, with the Bactrian <b>camel</b> in Mongolia and the Arabian <b>camel</b> becoming beasts of burden. By 1000 BC, caravans of Arabian camels were linking India with Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effect of alterations in hematological and biochemical parameters especially liver, renal enzymes and some element concentration on the reproductive performance of female <b>camels.</b> Blood samples were collected from 51 adult female <b>camels.</b> 39 adult female <b>camels</b> (diseased) suffered from anorexia, decreased body gain, some <b>camels</b> were emaciated and with varying degrees of reproductive abnormalities starting from repeat breeder, anestrous and infertility and 12 control <b>camels</b> that showed no evidence of clinical disease during clinical examination and samples collection. The results of hematological, biochemical and ultrasonographic findings were recorded. The hematological results showed significant reduction in erythrocyte count (RBCs), hemoglobin (Hgb), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) with significant increase in packed cell volume (PCV%). The leucocyte count (WBCs) and neutrophils percentage were significantly increased in diseased <b>camels</b> compared to controls while, lymphocyte percentage was significantly decreased in diseased <b>camels.</b> The serum activity of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinas (CK) and γ-glutamyl transferase (γGT) was significantly increased in diseased <b>camels.</b> The concentration of selected elements in serum indicated significant reduction in copper, calcium and phosphorous concentration in diseased <b>camels.</b> Progesterone concentration was significantly decreased in diseased <b>camels.</b> Other tested parameters did not differ significantly in diseased and control <b>camels.</b> In conclusion, the hepatorenal dysfunction parallel with inanition might affect on the reproductive performance especially ovulation...|$|R
50|$|Camelids {{are members}} of the {{biological}} family Camelidae, the only currently living family in the suborder Tylopoda. The extant members of this group are: dromedary <b>camels,</b> Bactrian <b>camels,</b> wild Bactrian <b>camels,</b> llamas, alpacas, vicuñas, and guanacos.|$|R
25|$|Most <b>camels</b> {{surviving}} {{today are}} domesticated. Along {{with many other}} megafauna in North America, the original wild <b>camels</b> were wiped out during the spread of Native Americans from Asia into North America, 12,000 to 10,000 years ago. Although feral populations exist in Australia, India and Kazakhstan, the only wild <b>camels</b> left are the wild Bactrian <b>camels</b> of the Gobi Desert.|$|R
5|$|In 1975, Richard Bulliet of Columbia University {{wrote that}} the {{dromedary}} exists in large numbers in areas from which the Bactrian <b>camel</b> has disappeared; the converse is also true to a great extent. He said this substitution could have taken place because of the heavy dependence on the milk, meat and wool of the dromedary by Syrian and Arabian nomads, while the Asiatic people domesticated the Bactrian <b>camel</b> but {{did not have to}} depend upon its products.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Peng Cui of the Chinese Academy of Sciences {{and colleagues}} {{carried out a}} phylogenetic study of the {{evolutionary}} relationships between the two tribes of Camelidae; Camelini – consisting of the three Camelus species (the study considered the wild Bactrian <b>camel</b> as a subspecies of the Bactrian <b>camel)</b> – and Lamini, which consists of the alpaca (Vicugna pacos), the guanaco (Lama guanicoe), the llama (L. glama) and the vicuña (V. vicugna). The study showed the two tribes had diverged 25 million years ago (early Miocene), earlier than previously estimated from North American fossils.|$|E
5|$|In Asia, nearly 70% of the {{population}} occurs in India and Pakistan. The combined population of the dromedary and the Bactrian <b>camel</b> decreased by around 21% between 1994 and 2004. The dromedary is sympatric with the Bactrian <b>camel</b> in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and central and southwestern Asia. India has a dromedary population of less than one million, with most (0.67 million) {{in the state of}} Rajasthan. Populations in Pakistan decreased from 1.1 million in 1994 to 0.8 million in 2005 – a 29% decline. According to the FAO, the dromedary population in six countries of the Persian Gulf was nearly 0.67 million in 2003. In the Persian Gulf region the dromedary is locally classified into breeds including Al-Majahem, Al-Hamrah, Al-Safrah, Al-Zarkah and Al-Shakha, based on coat colour. The UAE has three prominent breeds; Racing <b>camel,</b> Al-Arabiat and Al-Kazmiat.|$|E

5|$|Lhermitte {{approached}} the anchored ships at 18:00, flying false Danish colours, and anchored nearby. A ship's boat from <b>Camel</b> {{approached the}} new arrival, rapidly realising that Preneuse was a hostile frigate {{and returning to}} their ship. Lieutenant William Fothergill, the most senior officer with the convoy, fired warning shots close to the frigate, which Lhermitte ignored. Both British ships then prepared for action. At 20:30, Preneuse began to approach Rattlesnake and Fothergill opened fire immediately, joined by <b>Camel.</b> Lhermitte returned fire, focusing its broadside on <b>Camel.</b> By midnight <b>Camel</b> had taken several shot in the hull causing widespread flooding, and the crew ceased firing to man the pumps. Lhermitte apparently believed that <b>Camel</b> had abandoned the fight and he switched fire towards Rattlesnake, the engagement continuing until 03:30 at which point Lhermitte slipped his anchor and pulled out of range. Remaining in the bay until 10:00 before standing out to sea. British losses were two killed and twelve wounded, both <b>Camel</b> and Rattlesnake badly damaged. It was later reported in French sources that Lhermitte believed the schooner Surprise to be a well armed naval brig, prompting his withdrawal. Preneuses loss in the action was around 40 killed and wounded, and the frigate {{was reported to be}} badly damaged; messages to this effect were hastily sent to the commander at the Cape, Captain George Losack who sent the 50-gun HMS Jupiter in pursuit.|$|E

50|$|Camelpox is {{a disease}} of <b>camels</b> caused by a virus of the family Poxviridae, {{subfamily}} Chordopoxvirinae, and the genus Orthopoxvirus. It causes skin lesions and a generalized infection. Approximately 25% of young <b>camels</b> that become infected will die from the disease, while infection in older <b>camels</b> is generally more mild.

5|$|The {{dromedary}} and the Bactrian <b>camel</b> often interbreed {{to produce}} fertile offspring. Where the ranges {{of the species}} overlap, such as in northern Punjab, Persia and Afghanistan, the phenotypic differences between them tend to decrease {{as a result of}} extensive crossbreeding. The fertility of their hybrid has given rise to speculation that the dromedary and the Bactrian <b>camel</b> should be merged into a single species with two varieties. However, a 1994 analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene showed the species display 10.3% divergence in their sequences.|$|E
5|$|The {{dromedary}} {{shares the}} genus Camelus with the Bactrian <b>camel</b> (C. bactrianus) {{and the wild}} Bactrian <b>camel</b> (C. ferus). The dromedary belongs to the family Camelidae. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle (4th century BC) {{was the first to}} describe the species of Camelus. He named two species in his History of Animals; the one-humped Arabian <b>camel</b> and the two-humped Bactrian <b>camel.</b> The dromedary was given its current binomial name Camelus dromedarius by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 publication Systema Naturae. In 1927, British veterinarian Arnold Leese classified dromedaries by their basic habitats; the hill camels are small, muscular animals and efficient beasts of burden; the larger plains camels could be further divided into the desert type that can bear light burdens and are apt for riding, and the riverine type slow animals that can bear heavy burdens; and those intermediate between these two types.|$|E
5|$|The ideal age {{to start}} {{training}} dromedaries for riding is three years, {{although they may}} be stubborn and unruly. At first the camel's head is controlled, and it is later trained to respond to sitting and standing commands, and to allow mounting. At this stage a <b>camel</b> will often try to escape when a trainer tries to mount it. The next stage involves training it to respond to reins. The animal must be given loads gradually and not forced to carry heavy loads {{before the age of}} six. Riding camels should not be struck on their necks, rather they should be struck behind the right leg of the rider. Leese described two types of saddles generally used in <b>camel</b> riding; the Arabian markloofa used by single riders and the Indian pakra used when two riders mount the same <b>camel.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{risk factors}} {{associated}} with spread of zoonotic organisms/diseases between human and camel/livestock were identified by veterinary service providers and KIIs as: livestock and wildlife common grazing and watering points, mixing of infected and healthy <b>camels</b> and other livestock herds at grazing and watering points, humans sharing water sources for personal hygiene and domestic use with <b>camels</b> and other livestock, aerogenic transmission due to close contact of <b>camels</b> and herders in the night housing “boma”, herders assisting <b>camels</b> during delivery and training young <b>camels</b> how to take water and suckle the mother.|$|R
