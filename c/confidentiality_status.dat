40|$|This report {{analyses}} {{the ethical}} and legal aspects of reproductive genetic testing in 11 countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, The Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK). The {{legal status of}} reproductive genetic testing in the countries under analysis is difficult to generalize due to the different regulatory systems adopted. These approaches are {{a reflection of the}} legal traditions and cultural and socio-religious beliefs which inform and shape public policy on assisted reproductive technologies and genetic testing. We divide approaches into two groups: public ordering (legislative, top-down approach) and private ordering (non-legislative, bottom-up approach). Even limiting our analysis to a number of countries that span the range from restrictive to pragmatic approaches, there is remarkable symmetry in both the (i) substantive requirements (i. e. gravity, health indications generally) and (ii) procedural safeguards (i. e. informed consent, counselling, <b>confidentiality,</b> civil <b>status,</b> oversight and accreditation) surrounding reproductive genetic testing. Indeed, irrespective of whether a country adopts a prohibitive or a permissive approach through legislation or self-regulation or a mix of both, the ultimate decision is [...] and should continue to be [...] a medical one. Nowhere is this more evident than in the substantive requirements. ...|$|R
40|$|Proper {{adherence}} to antiretroviral therapy {{is essential for}} {{improving the quality of}} life and decreased mortality due to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Our objective was to analyze {{adherence to}} antiretroviral therapy of patients with HIV/AIDS living in the area covered by the 13 th Regional Health Board (DIRES), whose seat is the city of Jequié – Bahia. It is an exploratory study with quantitative approach and the study setting was the city of Jequié. 34 patients with HIV/AIDS, of both sexes, registered in the center of reference and attended it regularly were informants of the study. Data were collected through a form with the information obtained processed with Microsoft Excel. The age of the respondents ranged from 24 to 60 years old. Most had low education, low income and were adept to Catholic religion. The time of diagnosis was 1 to 4 years. Concern in ensuring the <b>confidentiality</b> of HIV <b>status</b> was identified. We conclude it to be relevant promoting health education activities for treatment adherence, building and maintaining membership groups to discuss issues related to pathology and the legal aspects involved in the daily lives of patients living with HIV/AIDS. ...|$|R
40|$|Responding to patients' {{needs and}} {{preferences}} {{is important in}} the delivery of outpatient care. Recent and systematically collected data reflecting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected patients' opinions on how their outpatient care should be delivered are lacking. Our aim was to identify aspects of care that people with HIV in outpatient care in The Netherlands consider important and to evaluate {{the extent to which the}} received care meets their expectations. We measured patient preferences and experiences in a nationwide sample of HIV-infected patients using a modified, previously validated questionnaire (QUOTE-HIV). The aspects of care that were considered most important were specific expertise of the care provider in HIV medicine, the care provider taking the patient seriously and receiving adequate information about treatment options. In addition, <b>confidentiality</b> of HIV <b>status</b> at the outpatient clinic was a major concern. Patient experiences were positive, with the majority of the respondents indicating that they always or usually received care in accordance with their preferences. HIV-infected patients greatly value having care providers with HIV-specific expertise. Safeguarding the privacy of HIV status and the provision of information about treatment options are matters that deserve continuous attention in the delivery of outpatient HIV car...|$|R

40|$|M. Tech. (Radiography) The Radiology Information System and the Picture Archiving and Communication System {{have contributed}} to {{improved}} patient care by eradicating delays in the clinical management of patients. This is achieved by permitting access to instantaneous radiology interpretations and secondary consultations; creating a basis for teleradiology and reducing storage costs by replacing conventional archives with cheaper digital storage. However, the former has attributed to the recent rise in confidentiality breaches involving medical data in the United States of America. Yet, reports of this nature remain unknown in the South African context. Breaches by authorised users remain an under investigated issue and continue to threaten the confidentiality of data. This assumption was employed as the conceptual basis for this study while, the Theory of Planned Behaviour was utilised to generate probable causes of deviant behaviour. A sample of health professionals (n= 115) and information technologists (n= 2) was drawn to collect data. The extent of compliance was expressed as a percentage error of {{the discrepancy between the}} observed behaviour and the regulations stipulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The independent variable (work practices) were categorised into access restriction, intrinsic security measures and the actual breach incidences. The non-parametric Chi-Square test was used to calculate statistical significance the correlational extent of which was determined using the phi coefficient. Both Research Settings indicated poor compliance (percentage errors of 67. 3 and 70. 37) with the mandated regulations. The study provides insight about the <b>confidentiality</b> <b>status</b> within the South African context.

40|$|Introduction: The {{proportion}} {{of people living}} with HIV (PLH) in care and on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Russia is lower than in Sub-Saharan Africa (1). This is undoubtedly due {{to a variety of}} systems and structural issues related to poor treatment access, linkage and care delivery models. However, little research has explored the reasons that PLH are not in care from their own perspectives. This information can help to guide the development of approaches for improving HIV care engagement in the country. Materials and Methods: In-depth interviews were undertaken with 80 PLH in St. Petersburg who had never been in HIV medical care, had previously been out of care, or had always been in care. Participants were recruited through online PLH forums and Websites, outreach needle exchange and non-government organisation (NGO) programs, and chain referral. The interviews elicited detailed information about participants’ experiences and circumstances responsible for being out of care, and factors contributing to nonretention in HIV treatment. Verbatim transcriptions of the interviews were coded and analyzed using MAXQDA software to identify emerging themes. Results: Two types of care engagement barriers most often emerged. Some related to medical services, and others to the family and social environment. The most frequent medical service barriers were poor treatment infrastructure conditions and access; dissatisfaction with quality of services and medical staff; and concerns over <b>confidentiality</b> and HIV <b>status</b> disclosure. Social barriers were fears of potential harm to family relationships, negative consequences if status became known at work, and public stigmatization and myths associated having an HIV+ status. Social support from the PLH community and from family and close friends facilitated care engagement, as did motivation to take care of oneself and one's family. Most participants also described circumstances in which engaging into HIV care was brought about by an urgent issue (opportunistic infections) or was enforced through hospitalization or imprisonment. Trust in one's doctor and simply not wanting to die were also common motives. Conclusions: Stigma was a major barrier to care engagement, including fear that others would learn of one's HIV+ status, whether at work, in one's family, or in the general community. By contrast, support from family, friends and the PLH community contributed to care engagement...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: A {{prospective}} study comprising interviews with patients and then completing standard questionnaires was conducted among surgical patients at Muhimbili National Hospital from April 2009 to January 2010. The {{aim of the}} study was to examine the factors influencing quality of informed consent at surgical and gynaecological unit of the largest teaching hospital. Methods: Two hundred and thirty two (107 men, 125 women) patients undergoing intrathoracic, intraperitoneal and intra pelvic procedures were involved. One patient died before the discharge day. Operation information cards were allocated to 116 patients and the other half of patients received only oral information. The patients were asked to recall information at various points before and after surgery; this score was compared by age, provision of written information and <b>confidentiality</b> <b>status.</b> Results: It was observed that the patients were best informed on the day of discharge (81. 4 %). Old age adversely affected recall of information at all assessment points. Operation information cards improved recall of information. Almost all patients let their relatives to know about their disease status. Conclution: In conclusion it has identified that the process approach rather than single event approach with regard to procedures of gaining informed consent improves the rate of recall of information. The Junior Doctors are the most effective in imparting information relating to surgical treatment despite the fact that are not the ones carrying out the procedures. Elderly patients are likely to recall information relating to their surgery poorly. It also noted that written information is helpful. Out of culture medical confidentiality is not maintained in daily practice in this setting. Recommendations: It was stated that the way forward is: 	Extra effort is needed to improve procedures of gaining informed consent from elderly patients which includes, asking patient to recall establishing understanding, adding additional stimuli which includes, providing written information and approach should be process approach rather than single event approach. 	Written information should be given in addition to oral information to all patients. 	Study is needed to evaluate the position and quality of the relatives' opinion in the decision making by the patient during process of obtaining informed consent...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{provides the}} first general overview on PCR primers used by Member State control laboratories for the detection, identification and quantification of GMOs. The data has been collected from a survey launched in 2005. The survey aimed at reviewing the PCR primers used by ENGL members for control purposes and at gathering analytical {{details on the}} corresponding PCR procedures. It further aimed to provide a catalogue of DNA sequences {{as a basis for}} the future development of plasmid standards. Participants to the survey were specifically requested to provide information on the genetic targets and if relevant, the GM event for which the primers were designed, to include the sequences of primers and the purpose (qualitative/quantitative and screening/identification analysis), type (i. e. single, multiplex, competitive, double-competitive, simplex real-time or multiplex real-time) and specificity (gene-specificity, construct specificity or event-specificity) of the corresponding PCR assay. They were further requested to provide comments and references, as well as to specify the <b>confidentiality</b> <b>status</b> of data provided. As a quality control step, the collated information was checked against the corresponding data published in the GMOs methods database (<[URL] in literature or on the CRL web site (<[URL] and further edited and normalised. The survey has provided a very large amount of interconnected data. To streamline the consultation of the report, the results of the survey have been grouped in two sections according to the scope of the PCR analysis namely, GMO-specific, and Taxon-specific applications. The GMO section covers primers that are specific for transgene sequences while the Taxon section covers PCR primers that are specific for endogenous genes. The results of the survey have been further grouped according to the purpose of the PCR assay (qualitative/quantitative and screening/identification analysis) and its corresponding specificity. The data obtained from the survey was first analysed to verify representativeness of the results and identify general trends. The analysis revealed that the data set was representative since 55 % of the ENGL laboratories participated. Furthermore, the participants were geographically widely distributed across the Member States. The analysis also evaluated general trends such as the frequency by which published and/or validated PCR primers were used by member laboratories and the frequency by which GM events or genetic elements were targeted in the PCR assays. The general overview revealed that 83 % of the primers used by laboratories were published in peer-reviewed articles. Custom-designed primers or commercially available kits were rarely reported. The survey data further indicated that 44 % of primers were used for detecting common transgenic elements and endogenous genes while the other primers were predominantly employed for identification of authorised GMO. The general overview also revealed that 46 % of reported primers had been tested in collaborative studies. Further data analyses were performed on the sets of primers defined by the participating laboratories for a particular scope, purpose and specificity of the PCR assay. Strikingly, these analyses revealed a great variability of primers selection for GMOs control purposes. In general, however, a single primer pair was reported by more than 30 % of the ENGL members while there was a wide distribution of primer utilisation in the remaining laboratories. The primer pairs most commonly employed were construct-specific, while for quantitative identification, ENGL laboratories tended to use primers that were event-specific. In approximately 30 % of cases, primers designed for quantitative determination were also utilised for qualitative analysis. JRC. I. 6 -Biotechnology and GMO...|$|E
