2500|$|The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode the highest grade of the site, an [...] "A". Alasdair Wilkins writes [...] "Steven Moffat’s script is inordinately clever {{in how it}} uses {{the trappings of a}} fluffy, silly Christmas special to <b>crank</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> scariness of a good old-fashioned monster story. But after all that, tonight’s episode manages {{something}} that not all of its Christmas predecessors manage, as it anchors its story in something that feels particular to the holidays. There is a melancholy to the comings and goings that define this time of year, and “Last Christmas” recognises that from its title outward." [...] Praise was also given to Capaldi's performance in the special, [...] "If there’s one thing we never really saw in Capaldi’s first season as the Doctor, {{it was the kind of}} unabashed joy that so animated the 10th and 11th Doctors and made the tail-end of the 9th Doctor’s journey—including his Santa claim to Rose at the end of “The Doctor Dances”—so powerful. Well, it takes the full hour, but “Last Christmas” gets us there. It was worth the wait." [...] Digital Spy awarded the episode a 4 out of 5, stating that [...] "Moffat pulls off a number of difficult balancing acts spectacularly well, refusing to deliver another throwaway special that's heavy on the frothy festive cheer but light on real substance". They closed their review by saying [...] "Last Christmas is an absolute cracker. The festive fun factor is high, as is only right and proper, but it's often been said that Doctor Who is at its best when its roots are showing and here Moffat apes both Christopher Nolan's Inception and Ridley Scott's Alien to provide the viewer with both food for thought and fuel for our nightmares". The Daily Telegraph awarded the episode a 4 out of 5, calling it [...] "marvellously merry" [...] and stating that it [...] "had heart as well as head, so ended like a festive special should: happily, with a cockle-warming cosy glow". The Mirror also praised the episode, saying that it [...] "might have borrowed, somewhat heavily, from a few films, but it still had the Doctor Who spin". They also expressed praise over Clara's continuation, saying [...] "It’s great news that we will have another series with these two verbally sparring" [...] and closed their review by claiming the episode [...] "was [...] real Christmas treat to join Capaldi and Coleman on another adventure, and it was the icing on the cake that Clara is staying with the Doctor".|$|E

I tried to take the characters to places that they wouldn't want to go, were scared to go and to see what happened. I wanted to try and take a daring and confrontational approach.
