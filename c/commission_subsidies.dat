Botanical studies were conducted by the Commission in accordance with a plan developed in 1866 by Prof. Ignacy Rafał Czerwiakowski. The plan comprised projects in: floristics, systematics, phytogeography, ecology. Each year special grants were allowed to enable a few botanists to perform field studies for several days. The remaining {{part of the country}} was to be explored by non-subsidised amateurs. The Physiographical Commission sponsored 470 research projects in the area of botany (carried out by 158 botanists). The results of these studies included at least 937 published works. Most of them, 357 publications, were related to floristics; and 173 publications – to systematics.

40|$|In {{numerous}} East German cities extreme imbalances in {{the housing}} market have developed with the consequence of extensive housing vacancies. Primarily inner city housing units constructed in the late 19 th and early 20 th century and housing units constructed within the period of the socialist regime are concerned. The causes for these imbalances can be found in decisions of socialist urban planning, in demographic factors, in oversized federal promotion of new housing construction after the German unification, and in income increases of private households. The commission “Structural Change in the Housing Economy of the New Länder“, installed by the federal government, has examined this problem and submitted preliminary political recommendations on the federal level {{in order to reduce the}} housing market imbalances. The <b>commission</b> recommends federal <b>subsidies</b> for tearing off vacant housing units within a period of ten years. A measure like this raises the question how the risk can be handled that too many flats are torn down. In addition, the commission recommends to double the subsidies for households acquiring already existing flats for own use and to halve the subsidies for households investing in newly built owner-occupied housing in East Germany. These incentives to acquire existing housing units might prove too weak because of the strong preferences of East German households to live in single-family houses. Measures on the federal level can support but cannot replace necessary concrete planning and solution strategies in the vacancy-plagued cities “in situ“. ...|$|R
40|$|Peru's {{experience}} {{in the application of}} antidumping and safeguard measures is characterized by a radical change in the philosophy and procedures of trade {{at the beginning of the}} 1990 s, and by an increasing use of these mechanisms. Trade liberalization was accompanied by the liberalization of foreign currency transactions and of financial and labor markets. Also, the internal revenue administration was modernized, institutions for regulation and competition defense were created, and state enterprises were transferred to private owners or concessionaires. New laws and institutions were created to regulate markets, including INDECOPI, a novel government agency charged with antimonopoly regulation and consumer defense, and which houses the Antidumping and <b>Subsidies</b> <b>Commission.</b> This highly autonomous and technical Commission became the central player in the implementation of WTO rules and procedures for fair trade. Since the reform was launched, a total of 81 trade protection cases have been presented, of which 57 were followed by a dumping investigation. The application of antidumping duties was approved for 29 of the cases investigated. Only two cases of safeguard investigations were recorded, one of which (Chinese textile clothing articles) is still in the negotiation phase. This paper reviews that case {{experience in}} detail, concluding that Peru has clearly differentiated between unfair competition and dumping on the one hand, and damage and safeguards on the other, and has applied strict technical criteria to the former and broader political considerations to the latter. Despite recent indications of a partial retreat from those principles, the decade-old reform is expected to last. ...|$|R

When in December 1509 Palmes was elected to Parliament he at once resigned the recordership. The city rarely elected its recorder and the choice of Palmes may have been influenced by his recent despatch to London with two aldermen, one of them his fellow-Member William Nelson, on unspecified business.

40|$|The {{diversity}} of state interfering in agriculture causes problems {{within the range}} of agriculture expenses protection. The international comparing conception of agriculture sector subsidization comes from the FAO studies since the year 1970. The group of scientists within the OECD composed during the 80 's a sector subsidization unified classification methodology. The indicator Production Subsidy Equivalent (PSE) was used to compare the measure of agriculture subsidization (Svatoš et al. 1999). The discussion about the level of direct payments was the most controversial point of negotiation about agriculture. The European <b>Commission</b> claimed that <b>subsidies</b> decoupled from production have not influ-ence on production neither on competitiveness and at the other hand, high level of subsidies will hinder branch transformation. But the direct payments are not efficient decoupled from production. The di-rect payments should not have any impact on the farmer’s behavior in the perfect markets (Pokrivčák et al. 2004). Since the end of the 90 -ties in the last century, the agricultural financial support for farmers changed very little in the OECD countries. Between years 2002 – 2004, the total support decreased from the level of 37 % of sales value in the period 1986 – 1988 down to 30 % (in fact, that level was already reached in the period 1995 – 1997). Every year fluctuations in the level of agricultural support have been influenced mainly by political motivations standing behind the measures like limitations in the process of reflection of price development from international markets into domestic ones. Political reforms aimed at the change of agricultural support scheme for farmers especially targeting its decoupling from production. While this process is still going on, the support directly related to production still dominates in most member countries.

40|$|Consumers only receive part of {{the benefit}} of fuel subsidies, writes FLAVIO M. MENEZES QUEENSLAND motorists have had access to a subsidy on fuel for over over a decade, {{introduced}} by the state government in order to offset the fuel excise imposed by the federal government. The performance of the Queensland scheme is worth considering now that the national debate over fuel proces has intensified. In {{the course of his}} inquiry into the scheme last year, Justice Bill Pincus found that up to a third of the subsidy, which is currently equal to 8. 35 cents per litre, was not reaching motorists. As the total outlays with the scheme add up to around half a billion dollars, this means that roughly $ 170 million is being absorbed by suppliers. On top of that, taxpayers are paying the substantial administrative costs of a complex scheme. The reason that the scheme does not work is simple: markets do not take taxes or subsidies lying down. As markets react to a subsidy or a tax, the benefit is spread through buyers and sellers. A subsidy to petrol shifts the demand for petrol - that is, at the same pre-subsidy price consumers demand more petrol. This often results in increases in the incremental costs of meeting the additional demand. So prices rise as a result. The extent of the price rise depends on how responsive demand and supply are to changes in price. Importantly, even in markets that are considered to be very competitive, consumers might not get more than 80 per cent of the subsidy. In other words, {{there is no reason why}} motorists should expect 100 per cent of the subsidy. The recently announced modified scheme, under which Queensland motorists would swipe a bar code on their drivers licence at the point of sale to receive the 8. 35 cent a litre subsidy, is also destined to fail. Retailers could set a higher browser price, which would partially offset the subsidy, just like under the current scheme. In addition, there will be significant administrative costs. It will be another scheme that does not work. Excluding interstate motorists from the scheme sounds like a neat idea, but it is full of problems. Once the subsidy is added to the current price, bowser prices in Queensland might actually be higher than in other states, and visitors to the state will pay the full price. Treating visitors in this way will do nothing good for our tourist industry. And there is the risk that other states might retaliate, by requiring visiting Queenslanders to show ID before getting access to public services. What are the alternatives then? Perhaps the best alternative is to eliminate the subsidy altogether and spend the half billion dollars each year on improving transport infrastructure. This might reduce travel times and result in less congestion, pollution and produce a lower fuel bill for everyone. Following the same logic as outlined above, the elimination of the 8. 35 cents per litre subsidy is likely to lead to a price increase of less than the full amount of the subsidy. Of course, it is a difficult political issue to convince voters, who currently face higher prices for groceries, petrol and increased mortgage repayments, that they should give up a 5 to 6 cents-per-litre subsidy in exchange for expenditures of the full 8. 35 cents per litre on infrastructure improvements that will only felt by the public in a few years time. Nevertheless, if the Queensland government made a serious effort to explain the issues, it should be able to sell the idea. Apart from the attraction of a constant and significant flow of new resources invested in transport there is the elimination of the $ 170 million per annum transfer to the oil industry. The Pincus inquiry showed that this slippage is inherent in the current system. Queensland’s new scheme will do nothing to change it. Nationally, the lesson from Queensland is clear: subsidising the cost of fuel is no solution to the problem of rising prices. • Flavio M.
