Studies are reported in which sheep and swine were used to compare the hematology and lethality response resulting from radiation exposure encountered in a variety of forms, including acute (high dose-rate), chronic (low dose-rate), combinations of acute and chronic, and whether received as a continuous or as fractionated exposure. While sheep and swine are basically similar in response to acute radiation, their sensitivity to <b>chronic</b> <b>irradiation</b> is markedly different.

These models are implemented as the systems of non-linear ordinary differential equations, whose vari-ables and constant parameters have clear biological meaning. The modeling studies revealed general regular-ities and characteristic features of {{the dynamics of}} the aforementioned hematopoietic lineages in acutely and chronically irradiated humans. It is shown that the modeling predictions qualitatively and quantitatively agree with the respective clinical data for humans exposed to acute and <b>chronic</b> <b>irradiation</b> in wide ranges of doses and dose rates. The ‘lethal ’ dose rate of <b>chronic</b> <b>irradiation,</b> which is evaluated in the framework of the granu-locytopoiesis model, coincides with the real minimal dose rate of lethal <b>chronic</b> <b>irradiation</b> for humans.

In particular, to date, few studies have investigated the correlation between low-dose radiation and disease development. Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory airway disease that is recognized as a major public health problem. In this study, we evaluated the effects of low-dose-rate <b>chronic</b> <b>irradiation</b> on allergic asthma in a murine model. Mice were sensitized and airway-challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) and were exposed to continuous low-dose-rate irradiation (0. 554 or 1. 818 mGy/h) for 24 days after initial sensitization. The effects of chronic radiation on proinflammatory cytokines and the activity of matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) were investigated. Exposure to low-dose-rate <b>chronic</b> <b>irradiation</b> significantly decreased the number of inflammatory cells, methylcholine responsiveness (PenH value), and the levels of OVA-specific immunoglobulin E, interleukin (IL) - 4, and IL- 5. Furthermore, airway inflammation and the mucus production in lung tissue were attenuated and elevated MMP- 9 expression and activity induced by OVA challenge were significantly suppressed. These results indicate that low-dose-rate <b>chronic</b> <b>irradiation</b> suppresses allergic asthma induced by OVA challenge and does not exert any adverse effects on asthma development.

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pluripotent cytokine that plays {{an essential role in}} the pathophysiology of skin inflammation induced by UV irradiation. This study examined the effects of MIF on basement membrane damage following <b>chronic</b> UVB <b>irradiation</b> in mice. The back skin of MIF transgenic (Tg) and wild-type (WT) mice was exposed to UVB three times a week for 10 weeks. There was a decrease in intact protein levels of type IV collagen and increased basement membrane damage in the exposed skin of the MIF Tg mice compared to that observed in the WT mice. Moreover, the skin of the MIF Tg mice exhibited higher MIF, MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 expression and protein levels than those observed in the WT mice. We also found that chronic UVB exposure in MIF Tg mice resulted in higher levels of neutrophil infiltration in the dermis compared with that observed in the WT mice. In vitro experiments revealed that MIF induced increases in the MMPs expression, including that of MMP- 9 in keratinocytes and MMP- 2 in fibroblasts.

We now show that 1 alpha, 25 (OH) (2) D(3) can up-regulate IL- 10 mRNA expression and induce IL- 10 secretion in mouse mast cells in vitro. To investigate the roles of 1 alpha, 25 (OH) (2) D(3) and mast cell vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression in chronically UVB-irradiated skin in vivo, we engrafted the skin of genetically mast cell-deficient WBB 6 F(1) -Kit(W/W-v) mice with bone marrow-derived cultured mast cells derived from C 57 BL/ 6 wild-type or VDR(-/-) mice.

Treatment with a tumor promoter caused the heavily damaged epidermal cells to divide and p 53 -immunopositive clusters to form within 24 h suggesting that these cells may be progenitors of the mutant p 53 clusters associated with actinic keratoses and squamous cell carcinomas. In contrast to low fluence <b>chronic</b> <b>irradiation,</b> daily treatment with a higher fluence of ultraviolet-B produced extensive hyperplasia and considerably reduced penetration of photodamage. Exposure of chronically irradiated skin to an acute “sunburn dose” of ultraviolet-B also produced significant epidermal hyperplasia and resulted in complete loss of heavily damaged basal cells within 4 d postirradiation. The occurrence and distribution of cyclobutane dimers in human skin correlated well with putative sunlight exposure and resembled that observed in ultraviolet-B-irradiated mice.

Their skin was analyzed for the presence of sunburn cells (apoptotic keratinocytes) and for Fas and Fas-L expression at various time points. A dramatic decrease in the numbers of morphologically identified sunburn cells and TUNEL-positive cells was detected as early as 1 week after chronic UV exposure began. After 4 weeks of chronic UV exposure, these cells were barely detectable. This defect in apoptosis was paralleled by an initial decrease in Fas-L expression {{during the first week of}} <b>chronic</b> UV <b>irradiation</b> and a complete loss of expression after 4 weeks. Fas expression, however, increased during the course of chronic UV exposure. p 53 mutations were detected in the UV-irradiated epidermis as early as 1 week after irradiation began and continued to accumulate with further UV exposure. Mice exposed to chronic UV began to develop skin tumors after approximately 8 weeks, and all mice had multiple skin tumors by 24 weeks. Most of the tumors expressed Fas but not Fas-L. We conclude that chronic UV exposure may induce a loss of Fas-L expression and a gain in p 53 mutations, leading to dysregulation of apoptosis, expansion of mutated keratinocytes, and initiation of skin cancer...|$|R

Previously we reported that the accumulation of inducible nitric oxide（NO）synthase（iNOS）was induced only in human glioblastoma mutant（m）p 53 cells by acute irradiation with X-rays, suggesting a suppression of iNOS induction after acute irradiation with X-rays in wild-type（wt）p 53 cells.

Previous reports have shown that both nucleotide excision repair, which is the sole pathway in humans for removing UV photoproducts, and DNA replication are regulated by the circadian clock in mouse skin. Furthermore, the timing of UV exposure during the circadian cycle {{has been shown to}} affect skin carcinogenesis in mice. Because sunburn and skin cancer are causally related, we investigated UV-induced sunburn apoptosis and erythema in mouse skin as a function of circadian time. Interestingly, we observed that sunburn apoptosis, inflammatory cytokine induction, and erythema were maximal following an acute early-morning exposure to UV and minimal following an afternoon exposure. Early-morning exposure to UV also produced maximal activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad 3 -related (Atr) -mediated DNA damage checkpoint signaling, including activation of the tumor suppressor p 53, which is known to control the process of sunburn apoptosis. These data provide early evidence that the circadian clock has {{an important role in the}} erythemal response in UV-irradiated skin.

A major mediator synthesized in the epidermis in response to UVB irradiation is the secosteroid hormone vitamin D 3, and as such, considerable attention is now turning to the many physiologic processes that it regulates. Recent studies have uncovered an immunoregulatory interaction between vitamin D 3 and dermal mast cells for optimal protection against pathogenic outcomes associated with <b>chronic</b> UVB <b>irradiation</b> of the skin. Most biological effects of vitamin D 3, such as the regulation of transcription in target genes, occur when it binds to its nuclear receptor; however, some actions can also occur via a non-genomic signalling pathway. This review {{will focus on the}} relative importance of both pathways in the regulation of vitamin D 3 -mediated UVB protection and will highlight exciting recent findings that point to new research directions. ...|$|R
