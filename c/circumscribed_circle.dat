5|$|Kepler's {{first major}} astronomical work, Mysterium Cosmographicum (The Cosmographic Mystery) , {{was the first}} {{published}} defense of the Copernican system. Kepler claimed to have had an epiphany on July 19, 1595, while teaching in Graz, demonstrating the periodic conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in the zodiac: he realized that regular polygons bound one inscribed and one <b>circumscribed</b> <b>circle</b> at definite ratios, which, he reasoned, might be the geometrical basis of the universe. After failing to find a unique arrangement of polygons that fit known astronomical observations (even with extra planets added to the system), Kepler began experimenting with 3-dimensional polyhedra. He found {{that each of the}} five Platonic solids could be inscribed and circumscribed by spherical orbs; nesting these solids, each encased in a sphere, within one another would produce six layers, corresponding to the six known planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. By ordering the solids selectively—octahedron, icosahedron, dodecahedron, tetrahedron, cube—Kepler found that the spheres could be placed at intervals corresponding to the relative sizes of each planet's path, assuming the planets circle the Sun. Kepler also found a formula relating the size of each planet's orb to the length of its orbital period: from inner to outer planets, the ratio of increase in orbital period is twice the difference in orb radius. However, Kepler later rejected this formula, because it was not precise enough.|$|E

25|$|A polygon {{which has}} a <b>circumscribed</b> <b>circle</b> is called a cyclic polygon (sometimes a concyclic polygon, because the {{vertices}} are concyclic). All regular simple polygons, all isosceles trapezoids, all triangles and all rectangles are cyclic.|$|E
2500|$|Any {{regular polygon}} is cyclic. Consider a unit <b>circle,</b> then <b>circumscribe</b> a regular {{triangle}} such that each side touches the <b>circle.</b> <b>Circumscribe</b> a <b>circle,</b> then <b>circumscribe</b> a square. Again <b>circumscribe</b> a <b>circle,</b> then <b>circumscribe</b> a regular 5-gon, and so on. The radii of the <b>circumscribed</b> <b>circles</b> converge {{to the so-called}} polygon circumscribing constant ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{design of}} an {{extrusion}} profile {{has a large}} impact on how readily it can be extruded. The maximum size for an extrusion is determined by finding the smallest circle that will fit around the cross-section, {{this is called the}} <b>circumscribing</b> <b>circle.</b> This diameter, in turn, controls the size of the die required, which ultimately determines if the part will fit in a given press. For example, a larger press can handle [...] diameter <b>circumscribing</b> <b>circles</b> for aluminium and 55cm (22in) diameter circles for steel and titanium.|$|R
50|$|If two circles are the inscribed and <b>circumscribed</b> <b>circles</b> of a {{particular}} bicentric n-gon, then the same two circles are the inscribed and <b>circumscribed</b> <b>circles</b> of infinitely many bicentric n-gons. More precisely,every tangent line to the inner of the two circles can be extended to a bicentric n-gon by placing vertices on {{the line at the}} points where it crosses the outer circle, continuing from each vertex along another tangent line, and continuing in the same way until the resulting polygonal chain closes up to an n-gon. The fact that it will always do so is implied by Poncelet's closure theorem, which more generally applies for inscribed and circumscribed conics.|$|R
25|$|A related {{notion is}} the one of a minimum {{bounding}} circle, which is the smallest circle that completely contains the polygon within it. Not every polygon has a <b>circumscribed</b> <b>circle,</b> as the vertices of a polygon {{do not need to}} all lie on a circle, but every polygon has a unique minimum bounding circle, which may be constructed by a linear time algorithm. Even if a polygon has a <b>circumscribed</b> <b>circle,</b> it may not coincide with its minimum bounding circle; for example, for an obtuse triangle, the minimum bounding circle has the longest side as diameter and does not pass through the opposite vertex.|$|E
25|$|In geometry, the <b>circumscribed</b> <b>circle</b> or {{circumcircle}} of a polygon is {{a circle}} which passes {{through all the}} vertices of the polygon. The center of this circle is called the circumcenter and its radius is called the circumradius.|$|E
25|$|The angles {{which the}} <b>circumscribed</b> <b>circle</b> forms with {{the sides of}} the {{triangle}} coincide with angles at which sides meet each other. The side opposite angle α meets the circle twice: once at each end; in each case at angle α (similarly for the other two angles). This is due to the alternate segment theorem, which states that the angle between the tangent and chord equals the angle in the alternate segment.|$|E
5000|$|The ISO {{definition}} of roundness {{is based on}} the ratio between the inscribed and the <b>circumscribed</b> <b>circles,</b> i.e. the maximum and minimum sizes for circles that are just sufficient to fit inside and to enclose the shape.|$|R
50|$|In Euclidean geometry, the trillium theorem - (from лемма о трезубце, {{literally}} 'lemma about trident', теорема трилистника, literally 'theorem of trillium' or 'theorem of trefoil') is {{a statement}} about properties of inscribed and <b>circumscribed</b> <b>circles</b> and their relations.|$|R
5000|$|If {{a regular}} hexagon has {{successive}} vertices A, B, C, D, E, F and if P is any {{point on the}} <b>circumscribing</b> <b>circle</b> between B and C, then PE + PF [...] PA + PB + PC + PD.|$|R
25|$|The {{equation}} {{given by}} Fuss' theorem, giving the relation among the radius of a bicentric quadrilateral's inscribed circle, the radius of its <b>circumscribed</b> <b>circle,</b> {{and the distance}} between the centers of those circles, can be expressed as a quadratic equation for which {{the distance between the}} two circles' centers in terms of their radii is one of the solutions. The other solution of the same equation in terms of the relevant radii gives the distance between the circumscribed circle's center and the center of the excircle of an ex-tangential quadrilateral.|$|E
25|$|This {{ratio is}} equal to the {{diameter}} of the <b>circumscribed</b> <b>circle</b> of the given triangle. Another interpretation of this theorem is that every triangle with angles α, β and γ is similar to a triangle with side lengths equal to sin α, sin β and sin γ. This triangle can be constructed by first constructing a circle of diameter 1, and inscribing in it two of the angles of the triangle. The length of the sides of that triangle will be sin α, sin β and sin γ. The side whose length is sin α is opposite to the angle whose measure is α, etc.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{adopted a}} {{national}} insignia for all military aircraft in May 1917 using the colors specified for the U.S. flag, {{consisting of a}} white five-pointed star inside of a blue <b>circumscribed</b> <b>circle,</b> with a red circle {{in the center of}} the star having a diameter tangent to the pentagon of the interior points of the star. The insignia was ordered painted on both wingtips of the upper surface of the top wing, the lower surface of bottom wings, and the fuselage of all Army aircraft on 17 May 1917. However due to concerns about confusion with the markings of enemy aircraft, in early 1918 a red, blue, and white roundel similar to those used by the Allied Powers, in the former color arrangement of the defunct Imperial Russian Air Service, was instead ordered painted on all U.S. aircraft operating in Europe, remaining in effect until 1919.|$|E
5000|$|This proof {{consists}} of 'completing' the right triangle {{to form a}} rectangle and noticing that {{the center of that}} rectangle is equidistant from the vertices and so is the center of the <b>circumscribing</b> <b>circle</b> of the original triangle, it utilizes two facts: ...|$|R
5000|$|Let O be {{the point}} of {{intersection}} of the diagonals [...] and [...] Then the point O, by the second fact above, is equidistant from A,B, and C. And so O is center of the <b>circumscribing</b> <b>circle,</b> and the hypotenuse of the triangle (...) is a diameter of the circle.|$|R
25|$|Hierarchical Steiner {{chains are}} yet another generalization. If the two given circles of an {{ordinary}} Steiner chain are nested, i.e., if one lies entirely within the other, then the larger given <b>circle</b> <b>circumscribes</b> the Steiner-chain <b>circles.</b> In a hierarchical Steiner chain, each circle of a Steiner chain is itself the <b>circumscribing</b> given <b>circle</b> of another Steiner chain within it; this process may be repeated indefinitely, forming a fractal.|$|R

5000|$|In geometry, a {{circumscribed}} {{sphere of}} a polyhedron is a sphere {{that contains the}} polyhedron and touches each of the polyhedron's vertices.

50|$|Quadrature {{amplitude}} modulation {{is based on}} packing circles into circles within a phase-amplitude space. A modem transmits data {{as a series of}} points in a 2-dimensional phase-amplitude plane. The spacing between the points determines the noise tolerance of the transmission, while the <b>circumscribing</b> <b>circle</b> diameter determines the transmitter power required. Performance is maximized when the constellation of code points are at the centres of an efficient circle packing. In practice, suboptimal rectangular packings are often used to simplify decoding.|$|R

By symmetry, the angle 2θ between the centers of the Steiner-chain circles is 360°/n.
