5|$|Abiodun Alao of King's College London {{marks the}} Entumbane episode as {{the start of}} the Zimbabwe National Army's politicisation. The ex-Rhodesians' enthusiasm and success during the battle, coupled with Mugabe's {{readiness}} to deploy them, convinced many in ZAPU that ZANU–PF and the white community had united against them, and intensified ZAPU opposition to the government. ZIPRA guerrillas deserted from the assembly points and the National Army en masse following the rebellion's failure, fearing for their safety. Mugabe's sense of resolve regarding his political rivals was greatly strengthened, meanwhile; Entumbane satisfied him that white army officers and airmen <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> <b>on</b> in future conflicts with ZAPU. The Entumbane engagement was the RAR's last—its companies were allocated to other 1Brigade units later in 1981 during the military reform process—but a number of its white officers subsequently led units of the Zimbabwean special forces during the 1980s. Dyck, for example, headed the 1st Parachute Battalion.|$|E

After becoming a Hungarian vassal in 1403, Lazarević was offered peace by the Ottomans on his terms, and the Despotate {{was no longer a}} subject of the Ottoman Empire. Vuk returned to the Despotate shortly thereafter and the brothers ruled in accord. The Ottoman–Serbian peace, Hungarian–Serbian alliance, Hungarian ceding of large territories in the north to the Despotate, and the merger of Vlatković's province to Lazarević's domain, resulted in Lazarević expanding his claims on all the Serbian lands.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} of using only whole {{numbers in the}} definitions comes from practical considerations {{in the days when}} only whole cycles <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> <b>on</b> paper records. This leads to gaps in the definitions, as seen elsewhere on this page. The theoretical definitions have always been more carefully defined to include all frequencies. Unfortunately there is no agreement in standard reference works on what these ranges should be – values for the upper end of alpha and lower end of beta include 12, 13, 14 and 15. If the threshold is taken as 14Hz, then the slowest beta wave has about the same duration as the longest spike (70ms), which makes this the most useful value.|$|E

In 1306, when Pope Clement V asked the leaders of the military orders, Jacques de Molay and Fulk de Villaret, to present their proposals for how the Crusades should proceed, neither of them factored in any kind of a Mongol alliance.

500|$|As a {{means of}} {{isolating}} Röhm, on April 20, 1934, Göring transferred control of the Prussian political police (Gestapo) to Himmler, who, Göring believed, <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> <b>on</b> to move against Röhm.

The loyalty of the SS men would prove useful to both when Hitler finally chose to move against Röhm and the SA. By May, lists of those to be [...] "liquidated" [...] started to circulate amongst Göring and Himmler's people, who engaged in a trade, adding enemies of one in exchange for sparing friends of the other. At the end of May two former Chancellors, Heinrich Brüning and Kurt von Schleicher, received warnings from friends in the Reichswehr that their lives were in danger and they should leave Germany at once. Brüning fled to the Netherlands while Schleicher dismissed the tip-off as a bad practical joke. By the beginning of June everything was set and all that was needed was permission from Hitler.|$|E

500|$|At the time, multi-tracking equipment, though common, {{was less}} elaborate, and {{instrumental}} backing tracks were often recorded [...] "hot" [...] with an ensemble playing {{live in the}} studio.

500|$|Unlike in England, where kinship was predominately cognatic (derived {{through both}} males and females), in early modern Scotland kinship was agnatic (with {{members of a group}} sharing a, {{sometimes}} fictional, common ancestor through only the male line). Women retained the original surname of their family of origin at marriage and marriages were intended to create alliances between kin groups, rather than a new bond of kinship that joined two families together. In the Borders, on both the English and Scottish sides, there were extensive bonds of kinship, often reflected in a common surname. A shared surname has been seen as a [...] "test of kinship", proving large bodies of kin who could call on each other’s support.

500|$|Curtis's {{remaining}} {{career was}} based at {{a series of}} shore stations, initially as commander-in-chief Cape of Good Hope Station at Cape Town between 1800 and 1803, which he reportedly hated. In 1804 {{he was promoted to}} full admiral, and subsequently employed in Britain from 1805 to 1807 as part of the [...] "Commission for revising the civil affairs of His Majesty's navy". [...] This latter role was an important position and Curtis performed well, introducing many beneficial reforms to the service. In 1802 Curtis's eldest son Roger, a post captain in the navy, died suddenly while on duty. In 1809, after 40 years of naval service, Curtis took his final command, that of Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth. In 1810, he performed his last significant duty, when he presided over the highly controversial court martial examining the conduct of Lord Gambier at the Battle of Basque Roads. At the battle, Gambier had failed to support Captain Lord Cochrane and missed an opportunity to destroy the French Brest Fleet. Infuriated, Cochrane attempted to block the proposed vote of thanks awarded to Gambier for the reduced victory from Parliament. Gambier responded by demanding a court martial to pass judgement on his actions. Gambier and Curtis had fought together at the Glorious First of June and had been friends for many years, and Curtis <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> <b>on</b> by those in authority to [...] "show strong partiality in favour of the accused."
