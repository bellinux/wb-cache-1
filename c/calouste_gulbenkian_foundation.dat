5|$|Lochner's {{major works}} include three large polyptychs: the Dombild Altarpiece; the Last Judgement, which is broken apart {{and in several}} collections; and Nuremberg's Crucifixion. Only two {{attributed}} paintings are dated; the 1445 Nativity now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, and the Presentation in the Temple from 1447, now in Darmstadt. There is a smaller, earlier version of the presentation scene at the <b>Calouste</b> <b>Gulbenkian</b> <b>Foundation,</b> Lisbon, dated 1445. As secular works grew in demand and religious works became unfashionable in later centuries, 15th-century polyptychs were often broken up and sold as individual works, especially if a panel or section contained an image that could pass as a secular portrait.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his life, Gulbenkian was {{involved}} with many philanthropic activities including the establishment of schools, hospitals, and churches. The <b>Calouste</b> <b>Gulbenkian</b> <b>Foundation,</b> a private foundation based in Portugal, was started at his bequest in 1956 and continues to promote arts, charity, education, and science throughout the world. It is now among the largest foundations in Europe. By {{the end of his}} life he had become one of the world's wealthiest individuals and his art acquisitions one of the greatest private collections.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Gulbenkian's fortune was {{estimated}} at between US$280 million and US$840 million. Undisclosed sums were willed in trust to his descendants; the remainder of his fortune and art collection were willed to the <b>Calouste</b> <b>Gulbenkian</b> <b>Foundation</b> (Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian), with US$400,000 to be reserved to restore the Etchmiadzin Cathedral, Armenia's mother church, when relations with the Soviet Union permitted. The foundation was to act for charitable, educational, artistic, and scientific purposes, and the named trustees were his long-time friend Baron Radcliffe of Werneth, Lisbon attorney José de Azeredo Perdigão, and his son-in-law Kevork Loris Essayan. In Lisbon the foundation established its headquarters and the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum (Museu Calouste Gulbenkian) to display his art collection.|$|E
