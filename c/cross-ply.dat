50|$|This {{sidewall}} ply to bead tension {{support was}} a big reason for older <b>cross-ply</b> cord tire construction using the materials available in the early 19th century. The <b>cross-ply</b> cord arrangement orients the cords to more directly support the bead & wheel rim (like a sling: bead to cord and around below the tread back to the opposite bead, both ways, thus crossing plies of cords). However, with improved combinations of cord, bead, rim materials, and manufacturing techniques, combined with ongoing focus and research on tire efficiency and durability, it became both feasible and desirable to manufacture radial-ply cord tires, which, for many applications (despite higher costs), outperform and more than outlast (reliable-usual-service-life/cost ratio) similar <b>cross-ply</b> cord tire designs by (a) facilitating a flatter contact pattern with more evenly distributed pressure on the momentarily stationary area of contact between tread & ground and (b) lower operating costs over time: due to reduced tire temperature, decreased rolling resistance, lower puncture rates, greater longevity, etc.|$|E

Both unidirectional and <b>cross-plied</b> specimens were tested. The strengths of individual fibers were measured, and upper and lower bounds of composite strength were calculated using bundle theory. Fracture tests were performed on specimens containing center slots of various lengths, and the values of the critical stress intensity factor for initial crack propagation or final failure were calculated. For unidirectional specimens, these parameters depended on thickness; for <b>cross-plied</b> specimens, fairly constant values were obtained at room temperature.

40|$|Sheet forming of {{thermoset}} composites is {{a promising}} method to achieve reduction in manufacturing time and therefore cost. The behaviour of weaves has been thoroughly investigated and the PJN assumption is widely used. <b>Cross-plied</b> UD prepreg may initially show similar behaviour to weaves; however, the complete deformation is more complex, including slippage. Thus, the forming of <b>cross-plies</b> {{can offer a}} possibility of increased drapability compared to woven fabrics, but imposes difficulties in predicting forming limits and final fibre angles. The work presented herein aims to characterise the in-plane properties of <b>cross-plied</b> UD prepreg with the bias extension test method.

40|$|In the {{aerospace}} and wind turbine industries, high demand for light weight structures with high strength extend {{the use of}} composite laminates {{in a wide variety}} of geometries as load carrying elements. However, more complex geometries as curved composite laminates experience delamination and matrix cracking due to high interlaminar stresses induced in the curved region. Moreover, under cyclic loading failure on these components initiates under lower stress states so that fatigue behavior of curved composite laminates are critical. This thesis discusses the experimental investigation of fatigue behavior of curved composite laminates under bending moment. Bending moment is obtained at the curved region by applying axial load from both tips of the curved composite laminates. A special loading fixture is designed in order to apply axial load to curved specimens in universal testing machine. Two different lay-up configurations are investigated; [0] 15 s unidirectional as fiber dominated and [03 / 903 / 03 / 903 / 03]s <b>cross-plied</b> laminates as matrix dominated. Static loading experiments are conducted in order to obtain average ultimate strength of materials to use in fatigue loading experiments and compare the damage pattern with the fatigue failure. The load-displacement curves are recorded for both static and fatigue loading cases. The failure is observed using high speed camera under static loading. DSLR camera images and micrographs are taken for both static and fatigue experiments. Under static loading, two load drop is observed for [0] UD laminates until failure. Under fatigue loading, [0] UD laminates experience one sharp load drop, then stiffness degrades gradually until failure. The failure pattern of [0] UD laminates under static and fatigue loading is completely different. <b>Cross-plied</b> laminates show similar behavior on load-displacement curves and failure mechanisms under static and fatigue loading.

50|$|When {{leaving the}} factory, all non-V8 MGBs were {{originally}} fitted with Pirelli Cinturato tyres (CA67). <b>Cross-ply</b> tyres (560-14) were standard until 1972 with radials being optional.

Later on during the rubber bumper production period, alloy wheels were introduced on several different limited edition models - with the final one-thousand LE models being the last cars to leave the factory with alloy wheels which, although the same 5âx14â rim size as the RoStyle, had 185/70x14 radials fitted.

5000|$|Criticism of the {{handling}} of early examples in the UK led to the fitting as standard of radial-ply tyres on the larger-engined version {{in place of the}} more conventional (in the UK at that time) <b>cross-ply</b> tyres with which all versions were shod at the 1966 launch, and the retro-fitting of radial-ply tyres to early examples addressed the tendency of the rear wheels to slide uncontrollably in wet weather, justifying in the process Ford's investment in a new and relatively sophisticated rear suspension arrangement for the Mark IVs. [...] Even after that a contemporary nevertheless opined that the ride involved a certain amount of 'float', and reported that the nose-heavy handling called for a 'strong driver', a problem which the more expensive Zodiac and Executive versions mitigated through the fitting as a standard feature of power assisted steering. Cost constraints precluded adding power assisted steering for the Zephyr, but during its production run the steering ratio was lowered which reduced the strength needed to change direction by increasing the number of turns between locks from 5.5 to an even higher 6.4. [...] Another production modification for the 4-cylinder Zephyr involved redesigning the valve gear in order to eliminate the need on the early Mk IVs for frequent tappet adjustments.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the out-of-plane deformation behavior of unsymmetric <b>cross-ply</b> composite plates compressed inplane by displacing one {{edge of the}} plate a known amount.

The primary objectives are to study the out-of-plane behavior as a function of increasing inplane compression and to determine if bifurcation behavior and secondary buckling can occur.

Furthermore, while a symmetric <b>cross-ply</b> plate can postbuckle with either a positive or negative out-of-plane displacement, the unsymmetric <b>cross-ply</b> plates studied deflect out-of-plane only in one direction throughout the range of inplane compression, the direction again depending on the boundary condition...|$|E
