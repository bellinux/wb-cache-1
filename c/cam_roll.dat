6000|$|Where deep in mud <b>Cam</b> <b>rolls</b> his slumbrous stream, [...] And bog and desolation reign supreme; [...] Where all Boeotia clouds {{the misty}} brain, [...] The owl Mathesis pipes her loathsome strain. [...] Far, far aloof the frighted Muses fly, [...] 5 [...] Indignant Genius scowls and passes by: [...] The frolic Pleasures start amid their dance, [...] And Wit congeal'd stands fix'd in wintry trance. [...] But {{to the sounds}} with duteous haste repair [...] Cold Industry, and wary-footed Care; [...] 10 [...] And Dulness, dosing on a couch of lead, [...] Pleas'd with the song uplifts her heavy head, [...] The {{sympathetic}} numbers lists awhile, [...] Then yawns propitiously a frosty smile.

[...] Ah fair Delights! that o'er my soul [...] On Memory's wing, like shadows fly! [...] 10 [...] Ah Flowers! which Joy from Eden stole [...] While Innocence stood smiling by!-- [...] But cease, fond Heart! this bootless moan: [...] Those Hours on rapid Pinions flown [...] Shall yet return, by Absence crown'd, [...] 15 [...] And scatter livelier roses round. [...] The Sun who ne'er remits his fires [...] On heedless eyes may pour the day: [...] The Moon, that oft from Heaven retires, [...] Endears her renovated ray. [...] 20 [...] What though she leave the sky unblest [...] To mourn awhile in murky vest? [...] When she relumes her lovely light, [...] We bless the Wanderer of the Night.|$|R

The positioning device according to the invention has the following features: - At least one stationary spindle which has a single raised incline about its circumference, and which a drive unit turns in clock cycles, is used for positioning the workpiece carrier; - The workpiece carrier has at least two cams which are arranged and placed at certain distances so that, during positioning, two <b>cams</b> can <b>roll</b> against the raised side surfaces...|$|R
40|$|The correct {{operation}} and durability of the harmonic gear transmissions depends {{to a large}} extent on the precision of the execution, the deformation law and the durability of the flexible toothed wheel, the most requested element of the transmission. In this paper there is presented a comparative study of the deformation state of the short flexible toothed wheel of a double harmonic gear transmission for the case of four types of mechanical generators with two deformation waves: with <b>cam,</b> 2 <b>rolls,</b> 4 rolls and 2 eccentric discs. By analyzing the deformation laws of the flexible wheel for the 4 cases of generator waves, one can achieve {{a better understanding of how}} the harmonic engagement process takes place...|$|R

40|$|A {{plantain}} chips {{slicing machine}} was designed, fabricated and tested. This {{is perhaps a}} major advancement {{in the development of}} plantain chips. A cam and spring return mechanism was used to achieve both the feeding and the slicing operations. The machine was made as simple as possible for easy repairs and maintenance. It is designed such that the machine slices one tuber of plantain over one revolution of the <b>cam.</b> A conveyor <b>rolls</b> sliced chips to a tray {{with the help of a}} Geneva drive mechanism (or timer). A variable speed pulley system was used to reduce the motor speed to desired value. Test performance gave an efficiency of 74 per cent. Further modification is in view to further improve on the efficiency...|$|R

40|$|There {{have been}} {{conflicting}} observations regarding the receptors utilized by human multipotent mesenchymal bone marrow stromal cells (hMSC) {{to adhere to}} endothelial cells (EC). To address the discrepancies, we performed experiments with cells prepared with a standardized, low-density protocol preserving a sub-population of small cells that are rapidly self-renewing. Sialyl Lewis X (SLeX) and α 4 integrin expression were determined by flow cytometry. Fucosyltransferase expression was determined by quantitative realtime RT-PCR. Cell adhesion assays were carried out with a panel of endothelial cells from arteries, veins and the microvasculature in vitro. In vivo experiments were performed to determine single cell interactions in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). The CAM is a well-characterized respiratory organ allowing for time-lapse image acquisition {{of large numbers of}} cells treated with blocking antibodies against adhesion molecules expressed on hMSC. hMSC expressed α 4 integrin, SLeX and fucosyltransferase 4 and adhered to human EC from arteries, veins and the microvasculature under static conditions in vitro. In vivo, hMSC rolled on and adhered to arterioles in the chick embryo CAM, whereas control melanoma cells embolized. Inhibition of α 4 integrin and/or SLeX with blocking antibodies reduced rolling and adhesion in arterioles and increased embolism of hMSC. The results demonstrated that rapidly self-renewing hMSC were retained in the <b>CAM</b> because they <b>rolled</b> on and adhered to respiratory arteriolar EC in an α 4 integrin- and SLeX-dependent manner. It is therefore important to select cells based on their cell adhesion receptor profile as well as size depending on the intended target of the cell and the injection route...|$|R
