40|$|The {{analysis}} presented {{can be used}} {{to determine}} the design equations for augers that produce uniform vertical flow of granular material through containers with cylindrical cross-sections. The augers so designed have a constant outside diameter and a variable root or shaft diameter. Installed in cylindrical grain bins they could be used to convert a batch-in-bin dryer to a <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> <b>dryer.</b> The analysis is an extension of the work of Jones and Kocher (1995) who designed and tested such an auger for containers of rectangular cross-section, and determined flow to be uniform for practical purposes. The analysis follows the same concept used by Shivvers (1973) to develop augers with variable outside diameter to provide uniform vertical flow of granular material through containers with cylindrical cross-section...|$|E

Then the grain near the drying air is over dried, while on the other side, grain is under dried. Moisture gradient exists when drying is complete.

5000|$|The largest dryers are {{normally}} used [...] "Off-farm", in elevators, and {{are of the}} continuous type: Mixed-flow dryers are preferred in Europe, while Cross-flow dryers in the United States. In Argentina, both types are commonly found. <b>Continuous</b> <b>flow</b> <b>dryers</b> may produce up to 100 metric tonnes of dried grain per hour. The depth of grain the air must traverse in continuous dryers range from some 0.15 m in Mixed <b>flow</b> <b>dryers</b> to some 0.30 m in Cross-Flow. Batch dryers are mainly used [...] "On-Farm", particularly in the United States and Europe. They normally consist of a bin, with heated air flowing horizontally from an internal cylinder through an inner perforated metal sheet, then through an annular grain bed, some 0.50 m thick (coaxial with the internal cylinder) in radial direction, and finally across the outer perforated metal sheet, before being discharged to the atmosphere. The usual drying times range from 1 h to 4 h {{depending on how much}} water must be removed, type of grain, air temperature and the grain depth. In the United States, continuous counterflow dryers may be found on-farm, adapting a bin to slowly drying grain fed at the top and removed {{at the bottom of the}} bin by a sweeping auger.|$|R

The optimum angle of the slots with respect to the direction of propagation of the travelling wave was found to be in the neighbourhood of 55 ° at all moisture contents.

Aseptic {{processing of}} a low-acid multiphase food product using <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> microwave heating system can combine the advantages of an aseptic process {{along with those of}} microwave heating. The main objective of this research was to develop a systematic approach for biological validation of aseptic processing of salsa con queso products using a <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> microwave system operating at 915 MHz. Dielectric properties of pumpable food products were measured by a new approach (under <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> conditions) and compared with the dielectric properties measured by the conventional approach (under static conditions).

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model, algorithm, {{and computer}} program {{were developed to}} simulate the performance of cross <b>flow</b> grain <b>dryers</b> and cross <b>flow</b> <b>dryers</b> with energy saving. The mass and heat transfer processes were described by a system of four non-linear partial differential equations. This system of equations was solved by the MacCormack method with time splitting.

Equipment developed to obtain these data permitted variation of the initial air humidity, temperature, and velocity. Fixed bed drying experiments were conducted to validate the model. Simulations using various control regimens were made to determine the impact on energy consumption and cross <b>flow</b> <b>dryer</b> performance due to recycling air exhausted from various stages of the dryer. An iterative process was used to determine the initial conditions at the entrance to each section of the dryer.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{present study}} {{compared}} the interval until device exchange or death from pump-related failure {{in patients with}} pulsatile versus <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> left ventricular assist devices. MethodsData from Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (June 23, 2006, to March 31, 2011) compared the durability of implanted pulsatile and <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> left ventricular assist devices. The durability issues included pump replacement for infection, thrombosis-hemolysis, driveline failure, or pump drive unit failure, and death from driveline or pump drive unit failure. ResultsA total of 3302 left ventricular assist devices were implanted (486 pulsatile, 2816 <b>continuous</b> <b>flow)</b> and 98 pump exchanges or deaths from durability issues (46 pulsatile, 52 continuous flow; 3 % of implants). The interval to device issue was greater for the <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> than for the pulsatile devices (P < . 001). A comparisons of the causes for pump exchange or pump-related death showed (1) greater freedom from pump failure in the <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> compared with the pulsatile left ventricular assist devices (10 events/ 2816 <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> implants vs 39 events/ 486 pulsatile implants; P < . 0001); (2) similar exchange or pump-related death for driveline failure (1 / 486 pulsatile vs 7 / 2816 continuous flow; P = . 82); (3) similar exchange or pump-related death for thrombosis-hemolysis (2 / 486 pulsatile vs 28 / 2816 continuous flow; P = . 25); and (4) fewer exchanges or pump-related deaths from infection in <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> left ventricular assist devices (4 / 486 pulsatile vs 7 / 2816 continuous flow; P = . 034). Competing outcomes analysis corroborated this finding, with 54 % of <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> versus 23 % of pulsatile patients alive and receiving support at 12 months after implantation. ConclusionsThe Analysis of Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support data showed greater durability for <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> than for pulsatile left ventricular assist devices.

For example, patients with diabetes has an excessive sugar syndrome that should not be eaten white rice, but able to eat coarse rice normally. Therefore, in this paper, the fresh harvested paddy (Rough Rice) from field that dried by Must <b>Flow</b> <b>dryer</b> and then de-husked into Coarse Rice is studied their opportunities for diabetes patients consume. In this research, Rough Rice of “Hom-Mali-Daeng ” from Nakhornnayok provience of 700 tons are dried by Must <b>Flow</b> <b>dryer</b> to meet the commercial Rice Mill standard. Hot air temperature of 150 oC is used to remove the water evaporated from Rough Rice to the final moisture content of 14. 9 - 15. 1 %wb within one-pass operation with unlimited initial moisture contents. It is then de-husk into Coarse Rice and test their nutrients. It is found that have higher nutrients contents than fluidized Bed dried Coarse Rice.

Patients showed greatest desaturation whilst walking with the air cylinder (SaO 2 79. 2 (8. 59) %) which was significantly different from the desaturation with both <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> oxygen (87. 6 (5. 85) %, p = 0. 001) and PDOD (85. 6 (7. 36) %, p = 0. 004). There was no significant difference between the distance walked using oxygen delivered at 2 l/min by <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> or via the PDOD (p = 0. 72; CI 0. 34 to 1. 08). The mean (SD) distance walked on <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> oxygen (203. 6 (106. 1) m) and PDOD (207. 9 (109. 8) m) was significantly greater than the distance walked with the air cylinder (188. 6 (110. 02) m); (1. 12 fold increase in distance, CI 1. 01 to 1. 23, p = 0. 02, and 1. 14 fold increase in distance, CI 1. 01 to 1. 28, p = 0. 03,respectively).  CONCLUSIONS—These findings suggest that the pulsed dose oxygen conserving device was as effective as <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> oxygen in maintaining arterial oxygen saturation and that the use of this device was associated with similar improvements in exercise tolerance to patients taking <b>continuous</b> <b>flow</b> oxygen therapy. ...|$|R
