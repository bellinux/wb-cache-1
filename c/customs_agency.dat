5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the 1767 Townshend Acts, which established new duties on various imports and strengthened the <b>customs</b> <b>agency</b> by creating the American Customs Board. The British government believed that a more efficient customs system was necessary because many colonial American merchants had been smuggling. Smugglers violated the Navigation Acts by trading with ports outside of the British Empire and avoiding import taxes. Parliament hoped that the new system would reduce smuggling and generate revenue for the government.|$|E
5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the Townshend Acts in 1767 which established new duties on various goods imported into the colonies. These duties were relatively low because the British ministry wanted to establish the precedent that Parliament had the right to impose tariffs on the colonies before raising them. Revenues from these duties were to be used to pay for governors and judges who would be independent of colonial control. To enforce compliance with the new laws, the Townshend Acts created a <b>customs</b> <b>agency</b> known as the American Board of Custom Commissioners, which was headquartered in Boston.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Hotelito Desconocido {{planned to}} make a large {{expansion}} {{on the beach and}} tried to get two concessions from the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) to do the constructions. The first request was to expand the hotel on the beach by 5,577.1 m2 (60,031.4 sq ft) on one part, and 5,330.9 m2 (57,381.3 sq ft) on another. The petition passed through the Tomatlán <b>Customs</b> <b>Agency</b> without many problems. It then went to the SEMARNAT offices in Jalisco, where it was reviewed and passed after they considered that Hotelito Desconocido met the required regulations. The following year, however, the National Commission of Protected Natural Areas (CONANP) federal agency analyzed the expansion project and rejected it after considering that the natural reserve area Playón De Mismaloya would be affected by the construction. It specifically mentioned that the endangered turtle and bird species were not guaranteed to be protected if the construction took place.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on {{first-hand}} experience from Customs reforms in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) and presents unpublished data {{on the impact of}} Customs reforms on revenues, trade facilitation, private sector operators and frontline Customs officials behaviors in Africa. <b>Customs</b> <b>agencies</b> are usually one of the key revenue collection <b>agencies</b> in Africa. <b>Customs</b> officials usually consider trade facilitation measures as a threat for revenue collection and strive to increase control over private sector operators through systematic inspections and checkpoints in order to increase public revenues (in theory). In reality, imports undervaluation remains high as well as smuggling and transit diversion, which result in endemic corruption and increased clearance time and uncertainty. Because many issues lie in the internal weaknesses of <b>Customs</b> <b>agencies,</b> a revised approach to Customs reforms is needed to ensure, first, internal control of the organization and then gradually relax controls on operators and ensure formal trade facilitation. Without internal control and knowledge of the magnitude of the malpractices in most <b>Customs</b> <b>agencies</b> in Africa, private sector differentiation can not happen and therefore formal trade facilitation would remain inexistent, while results in terms of revenue collection will probably be below what can be achieved.
