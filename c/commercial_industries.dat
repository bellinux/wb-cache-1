5|$|The meat, blubber and fur {{coats of}} {{pinnipeds}} {{have traditionally been}} used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Seals have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. They are commonly kept in captivity and are even sometimes trained to perform tricks and tasks. Once relentlessly hunted by <b>commercial</b> <b>industries</b> for their products, seals and walruses are now protected by international law. The Japanese sea lion and the Caribbean monk seal have become extinct in the past century, while the Mediterranean monk seal and Hawaiian monk seal are ranked endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Besides hunting, pinnipeds also face threats from accidental trapping, marine pollution, and conflicts with local people.|$|E
5|$|The meat, blubber, baleen, and oil of baleen whales have {{traditionally}} {{been used by the}} indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Once relentlessly hunted by <b>commercial</b> <b>industries</b> for these products, cetaceans are now protected by international law. However, the North Atlantic right whale is ranked critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Besides hunting, baleen whales also face threats from marine pollution and ocean acidification. It has been speculated that man-made sonar results in strandings. They have rarely been kept in captivity, and this has only been attempted with juveniles or members of one of the smallest species.|$|E

Burggraf of Nurnberg: that means again GRAF (judge, defender, manager, G'REEVE) of the Kaiser's BURG or Castle,--in a word Kaiser's Representative and ALTER EGO,--in the old Imperial Free-Town of Nurnberg; with much adjacent very complex territory, also, to administer for the Kaiser.

40|$|Abstract—The <b>commercial</b> {{microelectronics}} <b>industry</b> {{is rapidly}} implementing Pb-free assembly strategies {{and it should}} be mostly Pb-Free within the next decade. This trend is driven by existing and proposed legislation in Europe and in Japan, which has already lead a number of firms (including AT&T, IBM, Motorola, HP and Intel) to adopt Pb-free implementation programs. This is another sign that the microelectronics industry has become truly global. Following Moore’s law, progress in microelectronics is brisk but not uniform: in many cases, <b>commercial</b> <b>industry</b> is ahead of the aerospace sector in technology. Progress by <b>commercial</b> <b>industry,</b> along with cost, drives the use of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) parts for military and space applications. We can thus anticipate that the aerospace industry will, at some point, be forced to use Pb-free components and subsystems as part of their standard business practices. In this paper we provide a snapshot of the <b>commercial</b> <b>industry</b> trends and how they may impact electronics in the aerospac...|$|R

40|$|The {{unprecedented}} {{rate and}} scope {{of change in the}} <b>commercial</b> microelectronics <b>industry</b> presents a significant challenge to, and a significant opportunity for, achieving affordable superiority in defense electronics. A proactive approach to making the industry inherently more leveragable is discussed. Defense microelectronics is inexorably linked to the <b>commercial</b> semiconductor <b>industry.</b> This is obvious in the case of COTS (Commercial Off the Shelf parts) and MOTS (Modified [...] e. g., upscreened [...] Off the Shelf parts) as these parts are produced by the <b>commercial</b> <b>industry.</b> However, even captive defense integrated circuit lines building specialized parts are being forced by their dependence on a commercial-industry-driven supplier base to follow commercial product/process/design trends. The just released 1997 version of the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (NTRS) describes the unprecedented changes occurring in the <b>commercial</b> <b>industry.</b> The industry is evolving from a more stable pre- 1994 technology evolution to a discontinuous post- 1997 technology evolution. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to discuss how these changes present both major challenges and major opportunities, for defense microelectronics, especially for applications involving long lifetimes, harsh environments and/or high consequences of failures...|$|R
