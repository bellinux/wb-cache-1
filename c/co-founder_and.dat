5|$|American {{historian}} Richard Landes, {{who specializes}} {{in the history of}} apocalypticism and was <b>co-founder</b> <b>and</b> director of the Center for Millennial Studies at Boston University, argues that new and emerging technologies often trigger alarmism among millenarians and even the introduction of Gutenberg's printing press in 1436 caused waves of apocalyptic thinking. The Year 2000 problem, bar codes and Social Security numbers all triggered end-time warnings which either proved to be false or simply were no longer taken seriously once the public became accustomed to these technological changes. Civil libertarians argue that the privatization of surveillance {{and the rise of the}} surveillance-industrial complex in the United States does raise legitimate concerns about the erosion of privacy.
