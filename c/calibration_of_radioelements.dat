40|$|The {{variation}} of heat production {{with respect to}} magma evolution is examined in four UK granites in which fractional crystallization accounts for the range of rock compositions present. Accessory minerals are the dominant hosts of U and Th in these granites and their role in controlling variations of these heat producing elements is assessed. Melt compositional parameters determine which accessory minerals precipitate (solubility control) and influence the partitioning <b>of</b> <b>radioelements</b> between early-crystallizing (fractionating) minerals and residual liquid.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} the characterization of pegmatitic granites located in the southern region of the Borborema Pegmatitic Province (BPP) with aerial and ground gamma ray data. Ground gamma ray data, radiometric and ICP-MS laboratory analysis showed that these granites have uranium concentrations varying between 0. 4 ppm and 7. 8 ppm, thorium concentrations varying between 0. 1 ppm and 21 ppm and potassium concentrations varying between 2 % and 5. 2 %. Based on these radiometric characteristics and using individual, ratios and ternary images <b>of</b> <b>radioelements</b> <b>of</b> aerial gamma ray data it was possible to distinguish from others country rocks a group of granitic pegmatitic bodies and also to individualize quartzitic formations from the northern and southern portions of the area, based on their different thorium (Th) contents. Ground gamma ray data, acquired for one of these pegmatitic granites, called Galo Branco granite, reveals an irregular spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>radioelements,</b> indicating mineralogical changes in contents and concentrations of accessory minerals during magmatic crystalization. Pegmatites intruding quartzites in the south portion of the granite were also distinguished using eU/eTh and eU/K ratios images.

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach of}} source-term evaluation for performance assessment of nuclear waste repositories uses speciation-solubility modeling tools and assumes pure phases <b>of</b> <b>radioelements</b> control their solubility. This assumption may not reflect reality, as most radioelements (except for U) may not {{form their own}} pure phases. As a result, solubility limits predicted using the conventional approach are several orders of magnitude higher then the concentrations <b>of</b> <b>radioelements</b> measured in spent fuel dissolution experiments. This paper presents the author's attempt of using a non-conventional approach to evaluate source term of radionuclide release for Yucca Mountain. Based on the general reactive-transport code AREST-CT, a model for spent fuel dissolution and secondary phase precipitation has been constructed. The model accounts for both equilibrium and kinetic reactions. Its predictions have been compared against laboratory experiments and natural analogues. It is found that without calibrations, the simulated results match laboratory and field observations very well in many aspects. More important {{is the fact that}} no contradictions between them have been found. This provides confidence in the predictive power of the model. Based on the concept of Np incorporated into uranyl minerals, the model not only predicts a lower Np source-term than that given by conventional Np solubility models, but also produces results which are consistent with laboratory measurements and observations. Moreover, two hypotheses, whether Np enters tertiary uranyl minerals or not, have been tested by comparing model predictions against laboratory observations, the results favor the former. It is concluded that this non-conventional approach of source term evaluation not only eliminates over-conservatism in conventional solubility approach to some extent, but also gives a realistic representation of the system of interest, which is a prerequisite for truly understanding the long-term behavior of the proposed repository. Therefore, it is a very promising alternative approach for source-term evaluation...|$|R
