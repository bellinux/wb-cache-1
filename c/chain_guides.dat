5000|$|VH45DEs {{made before}} 1994 used plastic timing <b>chain</b> <b>guides,</b> {{and over time}} these {{have been known to}} fail. This results in a noisy valve-train and parts of the plastic guides can end up in the sump and oil pickup, {{resulting}} in engine damage. Nissan changed to metal backed <b>chain</b> <b>guides</b> from 1994 onwards.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{versions of}} the M42 developed problems with the camshaft chain drive. The hydraulic tensioner, <b>chain</b> <b>guides,</b> idler wheel and rear lower chain case have all been updated to resolve mechanical wear problems experienced in the early {{versions of the}} M42. Since the updated cam chain tensioner is shared with the M44, people commonly refer to the revised tensioner as a [...] "M44 tensioner".|$|E

50|$|The {{timing chain}} was {{hydraulic}} tensioned {{and had a}} ratchet mechanism to keep the chain tight. The timing chain rode on one pivoting <b>chain</b> <b>guide</b> resting on the ratchet tensioner and one fixed guide attached to the engine block and cylinder head. The 1991 to 1998 DOHC engine had an upper timing <b>chain</b> <b>guide</b> in between the camshaft sprockets. The timing chain was lubricated via cast-off {{from the top of}} the cylinder head and one 'squirter' on the oil pump housing. The SOHC and DOHC engines used different timing chain sets.|$|R
50|$|It was {{equipped}} with ergonomically designed and located window switch {{on the top of}} the door pull handle operated by the drivers thumb, and the instrument lighting being much more noticeable at night than during the day, using a reverse effect of white light on the gauges with black numbers. The Q45's use of a Cloisonné insignia instead of a conventional grille also caused buyers to shy away because of its unconventional, bottom breather appearance, and may have been influenced from the first generation Ford Taurus, the 1994 model year update featured a more conventional appearance including a more traditional appearing grille, woodgrain/chrome interior trim and cushy seats, drawing influences from the Nissan Maxima. More sedate performance figures, slower 17:1 steering (except on the Q45t, which retained the original 15.1:1 ratio), lower ratio 1st and 2nd gears, and a dynamically smooth suspension were all added in 1993 to make it a more status-quo luxury sedan. Other changes include thicker glass, keyless remote, auto-dim rear-view mirror, dipping side view mirrors, an improved transmission heat exchanger and external ATF filter, new oval intake ports and revised disc injectors, and fog lights. Metal-backed camshaft timing <b>chain</b> <b>guides</b> were added in 1993 to replace the earlier model's less reliable plastic guides.|$|E
40|$|The {{conveyor}} chain drive system which included four sprockets, four flat bars (<b>chain</b> <b>guides)</b> and one {{conveyor chain}} had been assembled into commercial software, MSC. ADAMS. The conveyor chain was connected with rollers for {{running on the}} <b>chain</b> <b>guides.</b> The multi-body dynamics (MBD) simulation was implemented to study the large displacement of chain components which happened during rotations of the symmetric model of the conveyor chain drive system. The physical experiment had obtained by construction of the conveyor chain drive system regarding the MBD model. The speeds of chain drive were adjusted by a gear motor with a converter. The trajectory of conveyor chain links which respectively meshed and ran on sprockets and <b>chain</b> <b>guides</b> was recorded by a high speed camera. Furthermore, impact-contact forces by a collision of components in the conveyor chain drive system during rotation were analysis. The comparison between MBD simulation and physical experiment of the conveyor chain drive system was performed for validation of simulation models. The MBD simulation results were in good agreement with the experimental data which obtained an average error of 3. 95 %...|$|E

50|$|Toyota swapped the dual-row {{timing chain}} used in older engines for a single-row <b>chain</b> with plastic <b>guides</b> in 1983. The new system reduced {{drag on the}} engine but {{introduced}} a new maintenance problem. After about 100,000 miles of operation, the chain may stretch {{to the point that}} the hydraulic-operated chain tensioner cannot take up any more slack. The timing chain then impacts the plastic driver's side <b>chain</b> <b>guide,</b> breaking it within a short period of time and creating a noticeable chattering sound in the front of the engine, especially when cold. If the engine continues to be operated without the <b>guide</b> restraint, the <b>chain</b> will vibrate excessively on the driver's side and stretch rapidly. The result is any of several failure modes.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{friction}} complexity between <b>guide</b> and <b>chain</b> {{is generated}} by {{a large number of}} factors acting simultaneously, of which wear has a significant share. During transmission functioning, <b>guide</b> and <b>chain</b> are subjected to normal forces in their contact surfaces. An analysis of the guide position can be described by a mathematical model. This paper presents a synthesis on the geometry of the contact between a <b>guide</b> and <b>chain</b> drive transmission. In {{the first part of the}} paper are established mathematical relationships underlying the extent of chain drives with a <b>chain</b> <b>guide.</b> Then, based on the mathematical model are traced a number of variation diagrams of geometric and kinematic parameters...|$|R
40|$|Accurate contact {{modeling}} is {{of great}} importance {{in the field of}} dynamic chain simulations. In this paper emphasis is on contact dynamics for a time-domain simulation model of large <b>chains</b> <b>guided</b> in a closed loop track. The chain model is based on theory for unconstrained rigid multibody dynamics where contact within the chain and with the track is defined through continuous point contacts using the contact indentation and rate as means. This paper presents an implicit method to determine contact parameters of the chain model through the use of none gradient optimization methods. The set of model parameters are estimated by minimizing the residual between simulated and measured results. The parameter identification is tested on four different formulations of the Hunt-Crossly hysteresis damping factor with the aim of recognizing a superior model...|$|R

40|$|Reactive planning, {{consisting}} of pre-defined sensoraction rules, {{is well suited}} to effectively respond to dynamic changes in real-time environments. However, it is in general challenging to strategically reason about long or short-term objectives using reactive planning. Therefore, ideally, deliberative and reactive planning should be integrated. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive interleaving of deliberative and reactive planning as our approach for dealing with real-time dynamic environments. Two main aspects {{are responsible for the}} success of the approach. First, the deliberative planner uses depth-bounded forward <b>chaining</b> <b>guided</b> by goalbased heuristics. Second, the real-time state space is discretized {{as a function of the}} average time that the deliberative planner needs to generate a plan. This ensures that the state, as seen by the deliberative planner, does not change in average while the plan is being generated. When a plan fails or a new plan is needed, the reactive planne [...] ...|$|R
