50|$|An aerial crane or flying <b>crane</b> is a <b>helicopter</b> used to lift heavy loads. As aerial <b>cranes,</b> <b>helicopters</b> carry loads {{connected}} to long cables or slings {{in order to}} place heavy equipment when other methods are not available or economically feasible, or when the job must be accomplished in remote or inaccessible areas, such as the tops of tall buildings or {{the top of a}} hill or mountain, far from the nearest road. Helicopters were first used as aerial cranes in the 1950s, {{but it was not until}} the 1960s that their popularity in construction and other industries began to catch on. The most consistent use of <b>helicopters</b> as aerial <b>cranes</b> is in the logging industry to lift large trees out of rugged terrain where vehicles aren't able to reach, or where environmental concerns prohibit the buildings of roads. These operations are referred to as longline because of the long, single sling line used to carry the load.|$|R

40|$|Objective: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the reliability of the Animal Rescue and Transportation Sling (ARTS) for emergency and clinical use in horses. Design: A retrospective study of the use of the ARTS in the hospital and field. Setting: The medical records of 158 horses referred to the Equine Hospital, University of Zurich, and 23 records from the Large Animal Rescue. Animals: The ARTS was used in 121 standing and 60 recumbent horses. Seventy-eight horses were sedated, 47 patients were under general anesthesia when the sling was applied and no sedation or anesthesia was required in 56 horses. Interventions and Main Results: The ARTS was applied in <b>crane</b> and <b>helicopter</b> rescue operations to stabilize horses that required lifting (n= 41), during emergency transportation (n= 24), to facilitate induction of general anesthesia (n= 4) or recovery from general anesthesia (n= 51). Additionally, the sling was used to immobilize horses with fractures (n= 29), to reduce weight-bearing in horses with severe lameness (n= 12), to support horses with disorders of the CNS (n= 7), to help recumbent horses rise (n= 9), and to provide support for horses after repair of large abdominal hernias (n= 4). Acceptance of the ARTS by the horses was scored as excellent (n= 153), good (n= 19) and poor (n= 6), and the sling was not tolerated in 3 horses. Only after long-term use (weeks) did the skin over certain pressure points become irritated, resulting in superficial pressure sores. Conclusions: The ARTS was reliable, safe, and easy to use. It proved to be ideal for a wide variety of emergencies...|$|R
5000|$|A helicopter-like vehicle {{appears in}} the film The Dark Knight Rises {{referred}} to simply as the Bat. It is an unconventional, lightweight volantor-like craft with a ventrally mounted rotor. Developed by Lucius Fox, the Bat was originally intended for close-quarters urban military operations but instead becomes Batman's new primary vehicle. Fox notes that the Bat's autopilot function does not work but suggests that Bruce might be capable of fixing it. The vehicle is armed with machine guns, cannons and {{a variation of the}} EMP device he used chasing Bane's men. Batman first uses the Bat to escape pursuing police officers after being cornered in a dark alley. Immediately after, he uses it to rescue Selina Kyle from Bane's henchmen. Later in the film's climax, Batman uses the Bat in the fight to retake Gotham City from Bane and he uses the Bat to haul a fusion bomb away from Gotham City where it detonates over the ocean and presumably kills him. Later, while completing work on the Bat, Fox discovers that Wayne had fixed the autopilot function months before and may have escaped before the bomb detonated.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a novel technique of active roll damping in marine vessels by the sole use of conventional thrusters. Many marine operations, such as <b>crane</b> operation and <b>helicopter</b> landings, should {{be carried out}} in small and steady roll motions. However, active roll damping devices such as fins and rudders lose their efficiency in low-speed conditions. This thesis provides a new methodology for roll reduction by adjusting the shaft speed and pitch of the propellers, by use of already installed thrusters. In order to develop a simulation environment suitable for representing realistic roll damping scenarios and validate the damping contribution from the thrusters, systematic experimental trials were {{carried out in the}} large towing tank at MARINTEK. The simulation model is based on the MSS Toolbox, with additional modifications added to represent roll motions more realistically, i. e. 4 -quadrant open water results and non-linear sway and roll damping. The numerical simulations and experimental trials, presented in the thesis, are compared with ship operations that require low roll motions, and shows promising results with significant roll reduction. Seakeeping trials related to roll motions are carried out to quantify the damping contribution. Decay tests showed average damping ratio 250 % higher using the proposed anti-roll system compared to the undamped case. Furthermore, regular waves showed 40 % damping in the area around resonance. Additionally, statistical values from irregular wave trials showed damping in the regime 30 - 64 %. Lastly, operability diagrams were created using numerical simulations and was compared with helicopter landing criteria. It was shown that helicopter landings could take place 34 % more often using the active roll damping system for oblique waves and 20 % more often for beam waves. Based on the results, it is concluded that the system works very well for moderate sea states, and that the damping contributions, that is to say in moderate sea state conditions, is comparable to that of currently available anti-roll system...|$|R
