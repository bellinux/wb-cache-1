In both Canada, and the United States the governments take a regular <b>Census</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture,</b> reporting in these censuses relies on the classifications.

The empirical approach uses a fixed-effects model to examine whether the change in the prevalence of contracting is correlated with the change in the spot market price received by individual farmers. This approach controls for unobservable time-invariant individual and county characteristics, such as product quality and location, that might be correlated with price and contracting prevalence. Findings indicate that a negative economically significant relationship between the share of local production delivered under production contracts and the price received by independent producers is unlikely. production contracts, alternative marketing arrangements, market power, spot market price, hogs, Agribusiness, Agricultural and Food Policy, Farm Management, Industrial Organization, Livestock Production/Industries, Marketing, Production Economics,...|$|R

These farms were characterized by aging populations, lack of successors, and a decline in operation size. Further, they tended to rent their farmland and had low rates of environmental conservation practices – both signal indicators of diminished capacity as operators in regional agriculture. Moreover, although no clear trends were identified among entrant farm households (those that began commercial agricultural operations during the same period), it is notable that they shared characteristics with discontinued farm households, such as being small scale operations and lacking successors. The current shortage of fiscal budget allocated to agriculture necessitates a narrowing and/or prioritization of support efforts.
