40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the compliance of peripheral artery changes with arm movement. This study aimed to quantify the bilateral difference in radial artery pulse morphology with one-side arm movement. Twenty-four healthy subjects were recruited. Radial artery pulses were synchronously recorded from both arms, with one arm (left or right) at five different positions (90 °, 45 °, 0 °, − 45 ° and − 90 °) and the other arm at horizontal level (0 °) as reference. Two types of indices of arterial pulse morphology were derived from the normalized arterial pulse signals: the waveform width corresponding to the 50 %, 60 % and 70 % pulse amplitude (W 50, W 60, W 70) and the total area of normalized pulse waveform (Apulse). No matter whether the <b>moving</b> <b>arm</b> was left or right arm, when compared with the other side reference arm, all the waveform widths decreased with <b>arm</b> <b>moving</b> from 90 °, 45 °, 0 °, − 45 °, and − 90 °. The bilateral difference of W 50, W 60 and W 70 with the <b>moving</b> <b>arm</b> (either left or right) at 90 °, 45 ° were significantly positive (both p < 0. 01) and significantly negative at − 90 ° (both p < 0. 05). Meanwhile, no matter whether the <b>moving</b> <b>arm</b> is left or right, Apulse decreased with <b>arm</b> <b>moving</b> from 90 °, 45 °, 0 °, − 45 °, and − 90 °. The bilateral difference of Apulse with the left <b>moving</b> <b>arm</b> were significantly positive at 45 °, 90 ° (both p < 0. 05). Meanwhile, the bilateral difference of Apulse from the <b>moving</b> right <b>arm</b> was significantly positive at 90 ° and significantly negative at − 45 ° and − 90 ° (all p < 0. 05). In summary, this study quantified the bilateral arterial pulse morphology between arteries with different compliances induced by a simple arm positioning procedure...|$|R

40|$|It is not {{yet clear}} how the {{temporal}} structure of a voluntary action is coded allowing coordinated bimanual responses. This study focuses on the adaptation to and compensation for a force profile presented to one stationary arm which is proportional to the velocity of the other <b>moving</b> <b>arm.</b> We hypothesised that subjects would exhibit predictive coordinative responses which would co-vary with the state of the <b>moving</b> <b>arm.</b> Our null hypothesis is that they develop a time-dependent template of forces appropriate to compensate for the imposed perturbation. Subjects were trained to make 500  ms duration reaching movements with their dominant right arm to a visual target. A force generated with a robotic arm that was proportional to the velocity of the <b>moving</b> <b>arm</b> and perpendicular to movement direction acted on their stationary left hand, either {{at the same time as}} the movement or delayed by 250 or 500  ms. Subjects rapidly learnt to minimise the final end-point error. In the delay conditions, the left hand moved in advance of the onset of the perturbing force. In test conditions with faster or slower movement of the right hand, the predictive actions of the left hand co-varied with movement speed. Compensation for movement-related forces appeared to be predictive but not based on an accurate force profile that was equal and opposite to the imposed perturbation...|$|R

40|$|A well-coordinated {{pattern of}} eye and hand {{movements}} {{can be observed}} during goal-directed arm movements. Typically, a saccadic eye movement precedes the arm movement, and its occurrence is temporally correlated with {{the start of the}} arm movement. Furthermore, the coupling of gaze and aiming movements is also observable after pointing initiation. It has recently been observed that saccades cannot be directed to new target stimuli, away from a pointing target stimulus. Saccades directed to targets presented during the final phase of a pointing movement were delayed until after pointing movement offset ("gaze anchoring"). The present study investigated whether ocular gaze is anchored to a pointing target during the entire pointing movement. In experiment 1, new targets were presented at various times during the duration of a pointing movement, triggered by the kinematics arm moment itself (movement onset, peak acceleration/velocity/deceleration, and offset). Subjects had to make a saccade to the new target as fast as possible while maintaining the pointing movement to the initial target. Saccadic latencies were increased by an amount of time that approximately equaled the remaining pointing time after saccadic target presentation, with the majority of saccades executed after pointing movement offset. The nature of the signal driving gaze stabilization during pointing was investigated in experiment 2. In previous experiments where ocular gaze was anchored to a pointing target, subjects could always see their <b>moving</b> <b>arm,</b> thus it was unknown whether a visual image of the <b>moving</b> <b>arm,</b> an afferent (proprioceptive) signal or an efferent (motor control related) signal produced gaze anchoring. In experiment 2 subjects had to point with or without vision of the <b>moving</b> <b>arm</b> to test whether a visual signal is used to anchor gaze to a pointing target. Results indicate that gaze anchoring was also observed without vision of the <b>moving</b> <b>arm.</b> The findings support the existence of a mechanism enforcing ocular gaze anchoring during the entire duration of a pointing movement. Moreover, such a mechanism uses an internally generated, or proprioceptive, nonvisual signal. Possible neural substrates underlying these processes are discussed, as well as the role of selective attention...|$|R

40|$|The nocturnal {{wandering}} spider Cupiennius salei has {{one pair}} of principal eyes and three pairs of secondary eyes located on the prosoma, which differ in both morphology and function. Their spectral sensitivity, measured with intracellular recordings, is due to three different types of photoreceptors with absorbance maxima in the mid-range of the spectrum, at 480 nm and 520 nm and in the UV at 360 nm. Based on these physiological data colour vision might be possible. In the present study, the ability to discriminate <b>coloured</b> <b>moving</b> stimuli from grey backgrounds was tested. The perception of <b>moving</b> <b>coloured</b> stripes in front of backgrounds with 29 different grey levels was measured by using extracellular recordings from the anterior median eye muscles as a monitoring system. Each of these eyes has two muscles, which increase their activity when moving stimuli are presented {{in front of a}} secondary eye. This variation in eye muscle activity can be recorded extracellulary in a living spider using a single channel telemetry device. If colour perception exists, the animal should be able to detect a <b>moving</b> <b>coloured</b> stripe in front of any grey level. Blue, green and red stripes were used as moving stimuli, in front of all 29 grey backgrounds. The results indicate that C. salei is not able to discriminate the coloured stimuli from distinct shades of grey.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the difficulty {{that patients with}} Parkinson’s disease (PD) have in performing fast movements, we used H 215 O PET to study regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) associated with performance of a simple predictive visuomanual tracking task at three different velocities. Tracking movements in PD patients (versus tracking with the eyes alone) were associated with a general underactivation of the areas normally activated by the task (sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the <b>moving</b> <b>arm,</b> bilateral dorsal premotor cortices, and ipsilateral cerebellum). Presupplementary motor cortex (pre-SMA) ipsilateral to the <b>moving</b> <b>arm</b> had greater than normal movement-related activa-tions. Increasing movement velocity led to increased rCBF in multiple premotor and parietal cortical areas and basal ganglia in the patients {{as opposed to the}} few cerebral locations that are normally velocity-related. The functional correlates of PD bradykinesia are: (1) impaired recruitment of cortical and subcortical systems that normally regulate kinematic parameters of movement such as velocity; and (2) increased recruitment of multiple premotor areas including both regions specialized for visuomotor control (ventral premotor and parietal cortices) and some that are not (pre-SMA). The overactivation of cortical regions observed in patients may be functional correlates of compensatory mechanisms and/or impaired suppression as a facet of the primary pathophysiology of PD. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

40|$|International audienceThe {{reflection}} of a moving hand in a mirror positioned in the sagittal plane can create an illusion of symmetrical, bimanual movement. This illusion is implicitly presumed to be of visual origin. However, muscle proprioceptive afferents of the arm reflected in the mirror might also affect the perceived position and movement of the other arm. We characterized the relative contributions of visual and proprioceptive cues by performing two experiments. In Experiment 1, we sought to establish whether kinaesthetic illusions induced using the mirror paradigm would survive marked visual impoverishment (obtained by covering between 0 % and 100 % of the mirror in 16 % steps). We found that the mirror illusion was only significantly influenced when the visual degradation was 84 % or more. In Experiment 2, we masked the muscle proprioceptive afferents of the arm reflected in the mirror by co-vibrating antagonistic muscles. We found that masking the proprioceptive afferents reduced the velocity of the illusory displacement of the other arm. These results confirm that the mirror illusion is not a purely visual illusion but emerges {{from a combination of}} congruent signals from the two arms, i. e. visual afferents from the virtually <b>moving</b> <b>arm</b> and proprioceptive afferents from the contralateral, <b>moving</b> <b>arm...</b>|$|R
