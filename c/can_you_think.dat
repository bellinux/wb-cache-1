I hope the band keeps playing forever â€” how many groups <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of who really make you believe they're playing for the joy of it?" [...] Robert Christgau gave the album a B but criticized [...] "Mountain Jam" [...] length: [...] "I know the pace of living is slow down there, but this verges on the comatose. And all the tape in the world isn't going to bring Duane back." [...] In a {{retrospective}} review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the record a solid five stars, calling the record a showcase of [...] "the Allmans at their peak." [...] David Quantick of BBC Music also considered it their [...] "creative peak," [...] praising the album's [...] "well-played, surprisingly lean bluesy rock." [...] The album is mentioned as the band's top studio recording in the 2008 book 1,000 Recordings To Hear Before You Die (2008), with author Tom Moon praising the record's [...] "sedate, beautifully contemplative studio material." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the Bogd Khaan era, the {{positions}} of the governments of China and Russia were clear and consistent. China was adamant that Mongolia was, and must remain, an integral part of China. The (provisional) constitution of the new Chinese republic contained an uncompromising statement to this effect. A law dealing with the election of the Chinese National Assembly provided for delegates from Outer Mongolia. For their part, the Russian Imperial government accepted the principle that Mongolia must remain formally part of China; however, Russia was equally determined that Mongolia possess autonomous powers so substantial as to make it quasi-independent. Thus, in 1912 Russia concluded a secret convention with the Empire of Japan delineating their respective spheres of influence: South Manchuria and Inner Mongolia fell to the Japanese, North Manchuria and Outer Mongolia to the Russians. Bogd Khaan said to Yuan Shikai, the President of the Republic of China [...] "I established our own state before you, Mongols and Chinese have different origins, our languages and scripts are different. You're not the Manchu's descendants, so how <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> China is the Manchu's successor?".|$|E
