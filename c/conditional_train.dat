40|$|Conditional {{preparation}} is a constituent part of overall sports preparation. <b>Conditional</b> <b>training</b> might {{be defined as}} a process of improvement of a sportsman’s functional and motor abilities, morphological characteristics, health, as well as the required motor knowledge. Conditional preparation can be might be classified as: general, basic and situational conditional preparation. Programs of the <b>conditional</b> <b>training</b> might be classified as: developing, resuming, recovering, preventive and recovering ones. High level of the general physical preparation enables maximum demonstration of the physical abilities of a sportsman during the stage of improvement of the specific motor abilities. Good general preparation of a sportsman enables him to push beyond his functional limits in order to cope with heavy loads easier, which subsequently enables him to achieve top performance level. Basic conditional preparation assumes the development of the most important judo abilities. Specific conditional {{preparation is}} related directly to the execution of different structural elements under the conditional requirements.

Children {{with autism}} are {{frequently}} taught to follow picture activity schedules to increase independence in task engagement and transitions. As textual behavior allows for greater independence and efficiency in responding, schedules should rapidly become textual in form.

40|$|For {{many large}} undirected models {{that arise in}} {{real-world}} applications, exact maximumlikelihood training is intractable, because it requires computing marginal distributions of the model. <b>Conditional</b> <b>training</b> is even more difficult, because the partition function depends {{not only on the}} parameters, but also on the observed input, requiring repeated inference over each training example. An appealing idea for such models is to independently train a local undirected classifier over each clique, afterwards combining the learned weights into a single global model. In this paper, we show that this piecewise method can be justified as minimizing a new family of upper bounds on the log partition function. On three natural-language data sets, piecewise training is more accurate than pseudolikelihood, and often performs comparably to global training using belief propagation. ...|$|R

40|$|Many early {{intervention}} curricular manuals recommend teaching auditory-visual conditional discriminations (i. e., receptive labeling) using the simple-conditional method in which component simple discriminations {{are taught in}} isolation and {{in the presence of}} a distracter stimulus before the learner is required to respond conditionally.

Here, we employed a non-invasive electroencephalography, with adhesive electrodes attached {{to the top of the}} skin, to measure brain activity of from 8 domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) while they stayed still to observe photos of dog and human faces. Spontaneous oscillatory activity of the dogs, peaking in the sensors over the parieto-occipital cortex, was suppressed statistically significantly during visual task compared with resting activity at the frequency of 15 - 30 Hz. Moreover, a stimulus-induced low-frequency (~ 2 - 6 Hz) suppression locked to the stimulus onset was evident at the frontal sensors, possibly reflecting a motor rhythm guiding the exploratory eye movements.

40|$|Parameter {{estimation}} in Markov random fields (MRFs) is {{a difficult}} task, in which inference over the network is run in the inner loop of a gradient descent procedure. Replacing exact inference with approximate methods such as loopy belief propagation (LBP) can suffer from poor convergence. In this paper, we provide a different approach for combining MRF learning and Bethe approximation. We consider the dual of maximum likelihood Markov network learning - maximizing entropy with moment matching constraints - and then approximate both the objective and the constraints in the resulting optimization problem. Unlike previous work along these lines (Teh & Welling, 2003), our formulation allows parameter sharing between features in a general log-linear model, parameter regularization and <b>conditional</b> <b>training.</b> We show that piecewise training (Sutton & McCallum, 2005) is a very restricted special case of this formulation.

Our results also {{provide a framework for}} analyzing the trade-offs of different relaxations of the entropy objective and of the constraints.

40|$|Background: Pain {{contains}} both sensory {{and affective}} dimensions. Using a rodent visceral pain assay that combines the colorectal distension (CRD) model with the conditioned place avoidance (CPA) paradigms, we measured a learned behavior that directly reflects the affective component of visceral pain, {{and showed that}} perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC) activation is critical for memory processing involved in long-term visceral affective state and prediction of aversive stimuli by contextual cue. Progress has been made and suggested that activation of vagal afferents {{plays a role in}} the behavioral control nociception and memory storage processes. In human patients, electrical vagus nerve stimulation enhanced retention of verbal learning performance. Cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK), which is a gastrointestinal hormone released during feeding, has been shown to enhance memory retention. Mice access to food immediately after training session enhanced memory retention. It has been well demonstrated that CCK acting on vagal afferent fibers mediates various physiological functions. We hypothesize that CCK activation of vagal afferent enhances visceral pain-related affective memory. Results: In the presented study, infusion of CCK- 8 at physiological concentration combining with <b>conditional</b> <b>training</b> significantly increased the CRD-induced CPA scores, and enhanced the pain affective memory retention.

40|$|Experiments {{designed}} to establish stimulus equivalence classes frequently produce differential outcomes {{that may be}} attributable to training structure, defined as the order and arrangement of baseline <b>conditional</b> discrimination <b>training</b> trials. Several possible explanations for these differences have been suggested. Here we develop a hypothesis based on {{an analysis of the}} simple simultaneous and successive discriminations embedded in <b>conditional</b> discrimination <b>training</b> and testing within each of the training structures that are typically used in stimulus equivalence experiments. Our analysis shows that only the comparison-as-node (many-to-one) structure presents all the simple discriminations in training that are subsequently required for consistently positive outcomes on all tests for the properties of equivalence. The sample-as-node (one-to-many) training structure does not present all the simple discriminations required for positive outcomes on either the symmetry or combined transitivity and symmetry (equivalence) tests. The linear-series training structure presents all the simple discriminations required for consistently positive outcomes on tests for symmetry, but not for symmetry and transitivity combined (equivalence) or transitivity alone. Further, the difference in the number of simple discriminations presented in comparison-as-node training versus the other training structures is larger when the intended class size is greater than three or the number of classes is larger than two. We discuss the relevance of this analysis to interpretations of stimulus equivalence research, as well as some methodological and theoretical implications...|$|R

Six experiments with nonreading preschool children posed the following question: Does a stimulus juxtaposed with a conditional discrimination task control relations among the stimuli {{involved in the}} task? In Experiments I and II, printed instance or concept words were juxtaposed with conditional discrimination tasks involving symbols. Results for eight of nine children demonstrated neither conditional nor equivalence relations between words and symbols. Would <b>conditional</b> discrimination <b>training</b> establish classes of visual stimuli composed of selectively nonequivalent subsets? In Experiment III, subjects from the first two experiments were taught conditional relations, then tested for stimulus class development. Printed words {{that could have been}} related transitively were not, apparently due to interference by identical letters in certain words, so no stimulus classes developed. Would the equivalence relations sought in Experiment III develop without a history where printed words were unnecessary to conditional discrimination tasks? For Experiment IV-A, one experimentally naive child was taught the same conditional relations as Experiment III subjects. Two stimulus classes emerged, each containing two subsets that were selectively nonequivalent depending upon trial context. Are direct or transitive stimulus relations more likely to control responding? In experiment IV-B, the subject from Experiment IV-A expressed more direct than transitive relations on modified matching trials. Would interference by identical elements in words be precluded by <b>training</b> <b>conditional</b> relations among words directly? One child in Experiment V was taught conditional relations between concept words and instance words, and instance words and symbols.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. 2016. Major: Pharmacology. Advisor: PINGYEE LAW. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); 145 pages. One {{of the major}} problems in treatment of opioid addiction is the repeated reuse and long-term memory of the drug-experience even after prolonged periods of abstinence. During the past decades, there has been enormous expansion {{in our understanding of}} how opioid drugs act on the nervous system. A complex brain network including the mesolimbic dopamine system, ventral striatum, extended amygdala, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus is suggested {{to be associated with the}} addiction cycle, in particular, the adult neurogenesis taken place in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus has a functional implication in opioid addiction. It is intriguing to study the convergence between the modulation of adult neurogenesis and opioid addiction, since the adult-born granule cells were shown to play a role in neuroplasticity of hippocampus function and in the development and retention of drug-contextual memory. In the first part of my study, I attempted to define the temporal window of morphine’s inhibitory effect on adult neurogenesis with a transgenic mouse model. Four days of conditioned place preference (CPP) training with morphine significantly reduced the number of late stage progenitors and immature neurons in the sub-granular zone (SGZ) of mouse hippocampus but did not affect the number of early progenitor cells. The results from colocalization of cell-type selective markers suggested that under the condition of CPP training, morphine affects the transition of neural progenitor/stem cells differentiate into immature neurons. When the transcription factor neural differentiation 1 (NeuroD 1) was over-expressed in DG by stereotaxic injection of lentivirus, it rescued the loss of immature neurons and prolonged the extinction of morphine-trained CPP. Next, a synthetic small molecule KHS 101 which was reported to increase NeuroD 1 mRNA in cultured neural progenitors and induce neuronal differentiation in the DG of hippocampus, was utilized to mimic the effect of lentivirus-mediated NeuroD 1 overexpression on morphine-primed CPP. The results indicated that subcutaneous injection of KHS 101 before <b>conditional</b> <b>training</b> could enhance the retention of drug-related memory and prolong CPP extinction; while the same treatment after <b>conditional</b> <b>training</b> disrupted the drug-contextual associations and shortened CPP extinction. Such KHS 101 ’s effect paralleled that observed when the over-expression of NeuroD 1 was temporally controlled with an inducible tetracycline system. Furthermore, the KHS 101 ’s effect could be abolished by the stereotaxic injected NeuroD 1 shRNA lentivirus. These studies suggest that morphine decrease the total numbers of newborn neurons in the SGZ by interfering with neural progenitors’ differentiation via a mechanism involving NeuroD 1. Since adult neurogenesis serves as an important form of neural plasticity, we assume that certain immature neurons contribute to the formation and consolidation of drug-contextual association memory, and NeuroD 1 plays a key role during this process. Such assumption is supported by the observation that compounds such as KHS 101 that could regulate NeuroD 1 expression in the hippocampus possess the ability to manipulate the extinction of drug contextual memory. In conclusion, the regulation of NeuroD 1 activity leads to modulation of adult neurogenesis, thus affecting the drug-association memory...|$|R
