50|$|Entomopathogenic {{nematodes}} are a {{group of}} nematodes (thread worms), causing death to insects. The term entomopathogenic has a Greek origin entomon, refers to insect, and pathogenic, which denotes causing disease. They are multi-cellular metazoans that occupy a bio control middle ground between microbial pathogens and predator/ parasitoids, and are habitually grouped with pathogens, most likely because of their symbiotic relationship with bacteria. Although many other parasitic thread worms cause diseases in living organisms(sterilizing or otherwise debilitating their host), entomopathogenic nematodes, are specific in only infecting insects. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) live parasitically inside the infected insect host, {{and so they are}} termed as endoparasitic. They infect many different types of insects living in the soil like the larval forms of moths, butterflies, flies and beetles as well as adult forms of beetles, grasshoppers and crickets. EPNs have been found in {{all over the world and}} a range of ecologically diverse habitats. They are highly diverse, complex and specialized. The most commonly studied entomopathogenic nematodes are those that can be used in the biological control of harmful insects, the members of Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae (Gaugler 2006). They are the only insect-parasitic nematodes possessing an optimal balance of biological <b>control</b> <b>attributes.</b> (Cranshaw & Zimmerman 2013).|$|E

40|$|A common way of {{scheduling}} jobs dynamically in {{a manufacturing}} system is {{by means of}} dispatching rules. The drawback of this method is that the performance of these rules depends on the state the system is in at each moment, and no one rule exists that overrules the rest in all the possible states that the system may be in. It would therefore be interesting to use the most appropriate rule at each moment. To achieve this goal, a scheduling approach which uses machine learning is presented in this paper. The methodology proposed in this paper may be divided into five basic steps. Firstly, definition of the appropriate <b>control</b> <b>attributes</b> for identifying the relevant manufacturing patterns. In second place, creation {{of a set of}} training examples using different values of the <b>control</b> <b>attributes.</b> Subsequently, acquiring of heuristic rules by means of a machine learning program. Then, using of the previously calculated heuristic rules to select the most appropriate dispatching rules, and finally testing of the performance of the approach. The approach that we propose is applied to a flow shop system and to a classic job shop configuration. The results demonstrate that this approach produces an improvement in the performance of the system when compared to the traditional method of using dispatching rules...|$|E

Moreover, by integrating WF into the DPM, we can predict the Ambient Potential Power Value (APPV) and then give the maximal time duration per service.

If a {{character}} had a Smarts of Level 1 (4-sided die, or d4) and wants to buy the Healing skill at Level 2 (six-sided die, or d6), it will cost 3 points - one point for Healing at Level 1 (d4) and two points for Healing at Level 2 (d6). If they had a Smarts of Level 2 (or d6) it would only have cost 2 points - one point for Level 1 (d4) and another for Level 2 (d6). The number of points usually assigned to spend on Skills is usually 15 points, but can be more in certain gameworlds.|$|R
40|$|The {{access control}} policy of an {{application}} that is composed of interoperating components/services is {{defined in terms of}} the access control policies enforced by the respective services. These individual access control policies are heterogenous {{in the sense that the}} services may be independently developed and managed and it is not practical to assume that all policies are defined with respect to some uniform domain vocabulary of policy attributes. A framework is described that provides a domain mapping for heterogenous policies. A fuzzy-based conversion mechanism determines the degree to which an access <b>control</b> <b>attribute</b> of one (service) policy may safely interoperate with an access <b>control</b> <b>attribute</b> of another (service) policy. The approach is scalable in the sense that it is not necessary to a priori specify every pairwise policy interoperation relationship, rather, where obvious interpretations exist then policy relationships are specified, while other relationships are inferred using the fuzzy mechanism. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Although the YAK protocol is claimed to be an authenticated key agreement protocol [1, 2], the authentication is just zero-knowledge verification of a random number, generated by the other party. There is no binding between entity identifiers and the session key derivation function. Any authenticated key agreement protocol should provide several security attributes, and it should withstand well-known attacks [4].
