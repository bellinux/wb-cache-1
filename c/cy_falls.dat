50|$|The next day, Rich and Wes {{are shocked}} {{to find out that}} Darla has been killed in a horse riding accident. Meanwhile, Megan turns out hospitalized and claims to Rich that her father is to blame. Rich, seeing how {{severely}} beaten up she is, fears losing her someday to Cy's abuse, and promises her to help her. As they return home, Megan tells Rich that she has placed a bomb in his bike, and that 'it will all be over soon'. The next morning, Rich is invited by Cy to accompany him on a bike ride, causing Rich to witness the explosion that throws him almost off a cliff. As <b>Cy</b> <b>falls</b> to his death, he tells Rich that he did not kill his wife. Rich starts to suspect that Megan may not be who he thinks she is, and meanwhile, he becomes the prime suspect in Cy's death in the investigation of Detective Anderson (Gary Farmer). Despite Anderson's attempts to make him turn in Megan, Rich denies any involvement in the entire ordeal, though evidence points against him. Wes is shocked that his brother would have killed anyone, and is mad at him for not having killed their own abusive father.|$|E
40|$|We have {{determined}} spatial patterns of expression of individual actin genes in embryos {{of the sea}} urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Radioactively labeled probes specific for each of five cytoplasmic-type (Cy) and the single muscle-type (M) mRNAs were hybridized in situ to sections of fixed embryos. M actin mRNA appears only late in development and is confined to a few cells associated with the coelomic rudiments. The five <b>Cy</b> mRNAs <b>fall</b> into three sets, whose times and sites of expression during development are highly distinctive. Different cell lineages express messages {{of one or more}} of these sets, but never all three. Although all Cy actin mRNAs exhibit monophasic accumulation in the RNA of whole embryos during the course of development, such accumulation in many cases results from the summation of both increases and decreases in abundance within individual sets of cells. Within the genomic linkage group CyI-CyIIa-CyIIb, expression of CyI and CyIIb appears to be co-ordinate, and quite distinct from that of CyIIa. CyI and CyIIb are expressed in all lineages at some point in embryogenesis, but confined mainly to oral ectoderm and portions of the gut of the pluteus larva. CyIIa mRNAs are restricted to mesenchyme lineages throughout late gastrula stage, and subsequently accumulate in parts of the gut. The CyIIIa and CyIIIb genes, which form a separate linkage group, are expressed only in aboral ectoderm and its precursors. Furthermore, CyIII messages are the only detectable actin mRNAs in this cell lineage after late blastula stage...|$|R
