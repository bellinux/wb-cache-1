40|$|In {{this essay}} I argue that to {{understand}} debates in jurisprudence {{one needs to}} distinguish clearly between four concepts: validity, content, normativity, and legitimacy. More specifically I show that debates between legal positivists and Dworkin should be understood not, as it is often said, as debates on the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity,</b> but rather as debates on the right way of understanding {{the relationship between these}} four concepts. After presenting the two different ways in which legal positivists and Dworkin understand this relationship, I argue that the Dworkinian approach is superior to the positivist one. The positivist account begins with an attempt to explain the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> and to leave the question of assessment of valid legal norms to the second stage of inquiry. But though appealing, I argue that the notion of validity cannot be given sense outside a preliminary consideration of legitimacy. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the momentum distribution of weakly interacting 1 D Bose gases at thermal equilibrium both experimentally and theoretically. Momentum distribution of single 1 D Bose gases is measured using a focusing technique, whose resolution we improve via a guiding scheme. The momentum distribution compares {{very well with}} quantum Monte Carlo calculations for the Lieb-Liniger model at finite temperature, allowing for an accurate thermometry of the gas that agrees with (and improves upon) the thermometry based on in situ density fluctuation measurements. The quasi-condensation crossover is investigated via two different experimental parameter sets, corresponding to the two different sides of the crossover. Classical field theory is expected to correctly describe the quasi-condensation crossover of weakly interacting gases. We derive the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the classical field theory, and find that, in typical experiments, interactions are too strong for this theory to be accurate. This is confirmed by a comparison between the classical field predictions and the numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Comment: 8 page...|$|R

40|$|In {{this essay}} I {{argue that in}} order to {{understand}} debates in jurisprudence one needs to distinguish clearly between four concepts: validity, content, normativity, and legitimacy. I show that this distinction helps us, first, make sense of fundamental debates in jurisprudence between legal positivists and Dworkin: these should not be understood, as they often are, as debates on the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity,</b> but rather as debates on the right way of understanding the relationship between these four concepts. I then use this distinction between the four concepts to criticize legal positivism.

Though appealing, I argue that the notion of validity cannot be given sense outside a preliminary consideration of legitimacy.

40|$|In the {{calculation}} of probabilities of physical processes occurring in a background classical field, the local constant field approximation (LCFA) relies {{on the possibility of}} neglecting the space-time variation of the external field within the region of formation of the process. This approximation is widely employed in strong-field QED as it allows to evaluate probabilities of processes occurring in arbitrary electromagnetic fields starting from the corresponding quantities computed in a constant electromagnetic field. Here, we demonstrate that the usual <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the LCFA in nonlinear Compton scattering, which only depends on the parameters of the external laser field, is quantitatively and qualitatively insufficient for describing the low-energy part of the emitted photon probability. In addition to their conceptual importance, these findings provide the theoretical tools to investigate quantitatively the role of low-energy photons in strong-field QED as well as to scrutinize the numerical schemes employed to interpret present and upcoming experiments in this field.

40|$|In this work, we have {{described}} the Brans-Dicke theory of gravity and given a particular solution by choosing a power law form of scalar field ϕ and constant ω. If we assume first law and entropy formula on apparent horizon then we recover Friedmann equations. Next, assuming first law <b>of</b> thermodynamics, the <b>validity</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> GSL on event horizon are presented. Also without use first law, if we impose the entropy relation on the horizon, then we also obtain the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> GSL on event horizon. The <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> GSL completely depends {{on the model of}} BD scalar field solutions. We have justified that on the apparent horizon the two process are equivalent, but on the event horizon they are not equivalent. If first law is valid on the event horizon then GSL may be satisfied in BD solution, but if first law is not satisfied then GSL is not satisfied in BD solution. So first law always favours GSL on event horizon. In our effective approach, the first law and GSL is always satisfied in apparent horizon, which do not depend on BD theory of gravity.

40|$|Recently, {{with the}} {{amendments}} {{brought to the}} Labor Code by the Law no. 40 / 2011, the written form of the individual labor contract became a <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> (ad validitatem).

This form is imposed for any type of individual labor contract in {{as far as the}} text pointed does not operate any distinction. The non-observance of written form when concluding the individual labor contract is sanctioned with absolute invalidity of the convention, sanction that can be covered by the parties by the subsequent fulfillment <b>of</b> this <b>condition.</b> The parties have the possibility to determine the invalidity occurred, but to also establish its effect according to the law.

40|$|In theory, {{the loan}} is {{generally}} {{defined as a}} contract whereby a person, called the lender, shall use or immovable property of another person, called the loan, which is obliged to repay in kind.
