50|$|Cuts from shaving can bleed {{for about}} fifteen minutes. Shaving cuts {{can be caused}} by blade {{movement}} perpendicular to the blade's <b>cutting</b> <b>axis</b> or by regular / orthogonal shaving over prominent bumps on the skin (which the blade incises). As such, the presence of acne can make shaving cuts more likely, and extra care must be exercised. The use of a fresh, sharp blade as well as proper cleaning and lubrication of skin can help prevent cuts. Common methods used to stop shaving-induced bleeding include: (1) pressing any simple alcohol onto the cut until the bleeding stops (e.g. with a cotton swab); (2) placing a small piece of tissue or toilet paper onto the cut; (3) applying styptic pencils and styptic liquids; (4) placing a small amount of petroleum jelly on the cut after most of the bleeding has ended (which can stop the bleeding without forming a scab), or (5) applying a small amount of aluminum chlorohydrate (commonly found in roll-on deodorants such as Ban). Shaving in or just after a cold shower can help prevent bleeding as well, because blood flow to the skin is reduced in these conditions because of vasoconstriction caused by the cold water. Shaving blade disposal in the era of safety razors and double-edged blades was a concern for a man's spouse and children who could easily take a blade, casually cast into the garbage, and in the process of compressing or compacting the garbage, cut themselves seriously. Some razor blade manufacturers include disposal containers or receptacles to avoid injuries.|$|E

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for producing foam particle from a thermoplastic polymer for interior parts of vehicles, comprises supplying the polymer to an extruder (1), plasticizing and subjecting the polymer with a propellant, removing the plasticized polymer from extruder over a nozzle and foaming due to expansion of the propellant, and cutting the polymer by a cutter (2) to form the foam particles. The cutter is arranged downstream to the extruder nozzle and comprises a cutting tool rotating around a <b>cutting</b> <b>axis</b> (3) with respect to the extruder nozzle. The foam particles are subjected with a velocity directed to the extruder nozzle. The foam particle in a partial plastic condition is cut by the cutting tool to the foam particles. The removed polymer is immediately cut by the cutting tool. A distance between the free end of the extruder nozzle and the outer circumference of the cutting tool is adjusted to 1 mm. The rotation axis is positioned in such a manner that the distance of the axis is half of the radius of the cutting tool. The foam particles are subjected with a speed impulse directed in a gravitation direction by the cutting tool and are promoted by a gas flow of the extruder nozzle, whose flow direction is chosen parallel to the direction of the speed impulse on the foam particles. The gas flow is produced by a negative pressure downstream of the extruder nozzle. The cutting tool is cooled with air and has the shape of a circular cylinder or -ring, and is intended at parallelly arranged edges, which have an extension direction component running in an axial direction. The edges of the cutting tool diagonally run under an angle of 0 - 60 degrees regarding the axial direction of the cutting tool. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a device for producing foam particle from the thermoplastic polymer. USE - Method of producing foam particle for producing polymer mold parts for packaging and for interior parts of vehicles.

40|$|Upper-mantle xenoliths in {{volcanic}} pipes <b>cutting</b> the <b>axis</b> of the Sierra Nevada batholith contain predominantly spinel-bearing peridotites (with sporadic garnet) and garnet websterites. In {{spite of}} the enormous thickness of the Sierran crust, the Sierran upper mantle has not attained the garnet peridotite stability field. The peridotites have forsteritic (Fo 88 _ 92) olivines, Cr-diopsides, Cr-spinels, and magnesian orthopyroxenes (En 8 g_ 92). Their texture and compositional characteristics of the coexisting phases indicate that these are fragments of the upper mantle that had undergone various degrees of partial fusion. The P-rconditions of reequilibration and mineralogical characteristics suggest that the partial fusion was accompanied by diapiric uprise. The REE distribution patterns are nearly chondritic. Garnet websterite xenoliths also contain magnesian and Cr-rich phases. Their bulk chemical compositions are like pyroxenite cumulates. The garnet websterites from Big Creek differ from those occurring at Pick and Shovel in having more Fe-rich phases and occasional hydrous minerals. The Pick and Shovel garnet websterites are interpreted to be pyroxene-rich, garnet-free cumulates formed by fractional crystallization of melts generated by partial melting of subcontinental lithosphere at depth> 60 km.

40|$|The {{remote cutting}} {{technique}} provides an enormous potential {{in terms of}} cutting speeds when working on thin sheets. Even on contour cutting speeds about 100 mmin are realizable. Working without any cutting gas, the material of the cutting kerf must be vaporized partially. It is evident that the energy input must be higher than for pure melting of the cutting kerf's material. In order to characterize laser cutting processes in terms of energetic efficiency, the severance energy can be used. This parameter depends on the necessary laser power to cut a defined sheet thickness at a certain cutting speed.

The rotating tool consists of multiple cutting edges (multipoint <b>cutting</b> tool). Normally <b>axis</b> of rotation of feed given to the work piece. Milling operation is distinguished from other machining operations on the basis of orientation between the tool axis and the feed direction; however, in other operations like drilling, turning, etc. the tool is fed in the direction parallel to axis of rotation. The cutting tool used in milling operation is called milling cutter, which consists of multiple edges called teeth. The machine tool that performs the milling operations by producing required relative motion between work piece and tool is called milling machine. It provides the required relative motion under very controlled conditions. These conditions will be discussed later in this unit as milling speed, feed rate and depth of cut. Normally, the milling operation creates plane surfaces. Other geometries can also be created by milling machine. Milling operation is considered an interrupted cutting operation teeth of milling cutter enter and exit the work during each revolution. This interrupted cutting action subjects the teeth to a cycle of impact force and thermal shock on every rotation. The tool material and cutter geometry must be designed to bear the above stated conditions. In this project work the design aspects of plain milling cutter is analyzed.

K is the centre of the single triangular plot that appears in the loop, which may be either I or O. KNL is a perpendicular from K to the <b>axis,</b> <b>cutting</b> it at N, and the outline beyond at L. In some loops N will lie above H, as in Plate 4, Fig. 8; in some it may coincide with H. (See Plate 6 for numerous varieties of loop.) These points were pricked in each print with a fine needle; the print was then turned face downwards and careful measurements made between the prick holes at the back. Also the number of ridges in AH were counted, the ridge at A being reckoned as 0, the next ridge as 1, and so on up to H. Whenever the line AH passed across the neck of a bifurcation, there was necessarily a single ridge {{on one side of the}} point of intersection and two ridges on the other, so there would clearly be doubt whether to reckon the neck as one or as two ridges. A compromise was made by counting it as 1-1/2. After the number of ridges in AH had been counted in each case, any residual fractions of 1/2 were alternately treated as 0 and as 1. Finally, six series were obtained; three for the right thumb, and three for the left.

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis has been developed to predict and measure the cutting forces in the gear hobbing process. A review of past {{research in this area}} has highlighted the need to adopt a different approach to modelling the process in order to predict the cutting forces. The hobbing process has been described using six different co-ordinate systems and the kinematic relationships between these systems established. A single rack profile has been used to represent the profile of a single cutting tooth from the hob which was then extended to simulate the hob itself. When the hob gashes pass through the cutting region surfaces are generated which, if mapped on a regular grid can give the basis to estimate the depth of cut, i. e. the instantaneous chip thickness produced by that particular tooth. The instantaneous cutting forces generated by that tooth then can be estimated by using the concept of a specific cutting force of the workpiece material. The estimation of cutting forces acting on a single tooth space was used to predict the cutting forces produced during machining of a full gear, by assuming that the forces acting in a particular tooth space are equal to those acting on the adjacent tooth space at an equivalent instant in the cutting cycle. In order to validate predicted results, a Churchill PH 1612 hobbing machine was retrofitted with a CNC control system at Newcastle University, utilising a programmable multi axis controller (PMAC). A specially made single toothed gear, and a full gear were machined, and cut on this machine, and the cutting forces measured in real time using a 3 -axis dynamometer. The force signals produced by the dynamometer were measured utilising a 12 -bit ADC card. Code, written in C, was developed to perform the many functions needed for the overall control of the machine, but additionally was used to capture both the <b>cutting</b> forces and <b>axis</b> position data.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to {{develop an understanding of}} the brushing process for a road sweeper so that a theoretical model of the process can be developed. The brush model has been confined to the kerb operating channel brush that usually sweeps about 80 % of the debris on the road in the region of the kerb. The other 20 % is swept by a roller brush beneath the vehicle. This has not been included in the study. A concept for a semi-autonomous road sweeping vehicle has also been proposed in order to sweep debris efficiently with minimum fatigue for the vehicle driver, although the debris sensing and control system have not been developed in this thesis. The metal tines of road sweeping brushes are usually rectangular in section (unlike cleaning brushes which are circular in section), giving rise to two commercial brush types. These are the flicking brush (major axis in the radial direction) and <b>cutting</b> brush (major <b>axis</b> in the tangential direction). A theoretical steady-state model of these two brushes has been developed which allows the calculation of brush axial loads, torques and tine deflection geometry as the brush rotates. The theoretical model has been validated experimentally within acceptable limits although this does require an experimental choice of the co-efficient of friction between the tines and the ground, usually between 0. 6 and 0. 7 for commercial brushes sweeping on concrete and tarmacadam surfaces. A dominant feature of the brush characteristics is the tine wear, as the brush stiffness increases over 120 % as the tine shortens by 40 %, which is the recommended minimum length taking into account brushing efficiency and damage to the road surface. The model can also be used as a tool to design new brushes so that, for example, by rotating the tine by 30 to 40 ° from the cutting brush configuration a 20 % improvement in mechanical efficiency is predicted. In order to assess the mechanism of debris removal from the road and its subsequent collection by the vacuum unit, the brush model has been incorporated into a brush sweep-gear linkage used by commercial vehicles to track the edge of the kerb. It has been shown that a constant brush contact arc on the road can be maintained by adjusting the brush angle of attack and brush height and that this relationship is independent of the vehicle speed and brush linkage with respect to the kerb. Under these contact conditions efficient sweeping may be expected. In the case of the Johnston 600 sweeping vehicle the brush contact arc angle is 150 °. This parameter is used as the output criterion for automatic control schemes that have been proposed to improve brushing efficiency and reduce driver fatigue. These will require the development of an on-line brush height sensor that can also measure brush wear...|$|R
