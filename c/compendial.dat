Previously, the applications of <b>compendial</b> poloxamer 407 preparations were demonstrated; however, low viscosity, poor elasticity, and sol-to-gel transition temperature (Tsol-gel) over a wide temperature range were observed.

Carbamazepine–saccharin and carbamazepine–nicotinamide cocrystals were prepared by the sonic slurry method and characterised with SEM, DSC, XRPD and particle size analysis. Solubility and dissolution testing (closed and open system) were performed in <b>compendial</b> media and media with a physiologically relevant amount of surfactant. Carbamazepine cocrystals (1 : 1 molar ratio) did not show a difference in the equilibrium solubility compared to the carbamazepine in <b>compendial</b> media but a substantial difference was observed in modified media. In <b>compendial</b> media, a faster dissolution rate was obtained only from the carbamazepine–saccharin cocrystal, whereas in modified media both cocrystals had a substantial higher dissolution compared to carbamazepine. With the selected method a clear difference in the dissolution profiles of each cocrystal is shown, driven by the characteristics of the coformer used.

Angle of repose, bulk density, tapped density, Carr’s compressibility index, and Hausner ratios were evaluated. Additionally, flow was characterized using a powder rheometer in which a sensitive force transducer monitors the forces generated {{as a result of the}} sample displacement. The critical attributes such as cohesivity index, caking strength, and flow stability were determined for samples. The samples consisted of different grades of magnesium stearate powder including bovine, vegetable, and food grade, physical mixture powder blend consisting of a model formulation, granules prepared by various methods including slugging, high shear granulator, and fluid bed dryer. Lubricant efficiency was also determined for granules lubricated with various concentrations of magnesium stearate. It was observed that the <b>compendial</b> methods were often non-discriminating for minor variations in powder flow. The additional characterization such as cohesivity, and caking strength were helpful in understanding the flow characteristics of pharmaceutical systems. The flow stability test determined that the powders were not affected by the test conditions on the rheometer.

Since it {{does not reflect the}} disintegration process in the oral cavity, alternative methods are proposed that are more related to in vivo conditions, e. g. modified dissolution paddle apparatus, texture analyzer, rotating shaft apparatus, CCD camera application, or wetting time and water absorption ratio measurement. In this study, three different co-processed excipients for direct compression of orally disintegrating tablets were compared (Ludiflash, Pharmaburst, F-Melt). The properties of the prepared tablets such as tensile strength, friability, wetting time and water absorption ratio were evaluated. Disintegration time was measured using the pharmacopoeial method and the novel apparatus constructed by the authors.
