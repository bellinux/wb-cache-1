Two {{of the patients}} were siamese, male and female, three years old cats and the third one was a male, six years old, short haired domestic <b>cat.</b> <b>Fever,</b> icterus, spleen enlargement, ematiation and weakness were the clinical signs observed. The main hematological alterations were anemia, apparently not related to hemobartonellosis, found {{in two of the}} cats, neutrophilia in all of them and lymphopenia observed in one. The necropsy made on two cats revealed that sepsis was the major cause of the worsening of clinical conditions of the FIV infected cats. Moraxella phenilpiruvica was isolated from kidney of one patient. All of the cats were FIV positive and FeLV negative and had been sick for a long time with clinical signs related to feline AIDS...|$|E

Serology surveys were performed among domestic feline in the State of Rio Grande do Sul and among wild felines in central Brazilian States. Felines with acute or chronic infections may become carriers for both viruses and, viral transmission occurs mainly by ocular and nasal secretions.

Here, the molecular characterization and neutralization patterns of FCV isolates from cases of severe, non-epizootic infection associated with skin ulceration and edema are presented. Samples from eleven symptomatic cats, four in-contact cats and 27 cats with no contact with symptomatic cats were collected and tested for FCV, feline herpesvirus- 1 (FHV- 1), feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Phylogenetic analyses based on the capsid (VP 1) gene of FCV and virus neutralization with antisera raised against four FCV vaccine strains were performed. Nine kittens and two adult cats in two shelters and two veterinary clinics in four geographically distinct locations in Switzerland and Liechtenstein were affected. The <b>cats</b> showed <b>fever,</b> tongue and skin ulceration, head and paw edema, and occasionally jaundice, generalized edema and dyspnea. All symptomatic cats tested FCV-positive but were negative for FHV- 1, FeLV and FIV, with the exception of one FIV-positive kitten. All kittens of one litter and both adult cats died. The disease did not spread to cats in the environment. Cats in the environment displayed phylogenetically distinct, but related, FCV strains.

The organism was identified from 4 species of fleas obtained from dogs and cats in Western Australia, by using polymerase chain reaction amplification and DNA sequencing of the citrate synthase and outer membrane protein A genes. Several rickettsial diseases have been documented inAustralia, namely, Queensland tick typhus (Rickettsia australis), scrub typhus (Orientia tsutsugamushi), murine typhus (R. typhi), and more recently, Flinders Island spot-ted fever (R. honei), {{as well as the}} closely related Q fever (Coxiella burnetii) and <b>cat</b> scratch <b>fever</b> (Bartonella henselae) (1, 2). Cases of murine typhus have been report-ed in Western Australia (WA) since 1927, and a serologic survey provided evidence that members of the closely related spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae are also pres-ent in the state (3, 4). R. felis is a newly discovered species within the SFG; it is transmitted by fleas, which makes it unique within the biogroup. The species was first detected in the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, and subsequently has been deter-mined to cause human disease in a number of countries (5 – 8). A recent study in New Zealand provided the first report of the organism in Oceania (9). Infected domestic and wild animals may not exhibit clinical disease and act as reservoirs of infection for humans. No definitive reports of the organism have been made in Australia, however, a study of cat fleas that used polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the amplifi-cation products (PCR-RFLP), provided strong evidence that R. felis exists (10).
