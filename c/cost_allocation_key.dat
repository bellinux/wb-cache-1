40|$|In healthcare, so far few {{data have}} been {{processed}} {{in terms of}} controlling and benchmarking of non-medical support services and their costs. With the introduction of case-based rate systems and increasing cost pressure situations in the healthcare sector, the need for <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> controlling, <b>key</b> performance indicators (KPI), benchmarking and a well-founded basis for strategic decisions has grown rapidly in Facility Management (FM) in healthcare. In order to provide a holistic and practically oriented solution, {{it was necessary to}} assess the requirements of the different KPI specifications of the various non-medical support services in hospitals. On the conceptual basis of the Service Catalogue for non-medical Support Services in Hospitals, the development of a KPI model was conducted in iterative interview sessions with different subject matter experts for FM in hospitals. The result is the setup of a systematic metamodel as the basis for a comprehensive KPI Reference Model for non-medical Support Services / FM in Hospitals providing the basis not only for controlling and benchmarking steps, but also for the development of corresponding adjustments of account plans and cost center accounting, as well as for aligning IT architectures...|$|R

Using a revised <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> – referred to in this paper as environmental <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> – the paper contrasts overhead <b>allocation</b> between traditional <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> and environmental <b>cost</b> <b>allocation.</b> In addition, production cost derived from the traditional <b>allocation</b> of waste <b>cost</b> is compared with the revised environmental <b>cost</b> <b>allocation.</b> Findings indicate that a revised environmental <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> discloses more accurate overhead cost and hence production cost; and that management is motivated to make informed environmental management decisions if a product related environmental cost is made to reflect in the production cost of the polluting product. The paper highlights the practical significance of objective environmental <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> on corporate waste management, which thus creates a valuable awareness {{on the part of}} the management and accountants of firms in developing countries for the need to fine-tune the dominant traditional costing system.

40|$|The {{debate on}} <b>cost</b> <b>allocations</b> in the {{management}} accounting literature {{has been dominated by}} a largely rationalistic perspective primarily informed by economic theories. However, there is growing evidence of institutional factors influencing <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> practices in organizations. This paper draws on neo-institutional sociology (NIS) and attempts to integrate prior research evidence of the institutional influence on <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> practices into an analytical framework. The core of our argument hinges on the observation that most <b>cost</b> <b>allocations</b> generate some degree of ambiguity. We argue that the implementation of various <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> techniques (in terms of their coupling to operating control) reflects differences in management of such ambiguity, but that this is conditioned by the patterns in which <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> techniques diffuse across organizations. We also address some pertinent criticisms of the NIS literature by discussing how certain intra-organizational factors and aspects of the organization's technical environment might interact with external institutional pressures in the implementation of <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> techniques. We advance six research propositions reflecting how such external institutional pressures and interaction effects influence the coupling of <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> practices to operating control. ...|$|R

The main {{challenge is to}} enforce such selfish multicast flows to stabilize at a socially optimal operating point incurring minimum total edge cost, through appropriate <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> and other economic measures, with replicable and encodable properties of information flows considered. We show that known <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> schemes are not sufficient. We provide a shadow-price based <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> for networks without capacity limits, and show it enforces minimum-cost multicast. This improves previous result where a 2 -approximate multicast flow is enforced. For capacitied networks, computing <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> by ignoring edge capacities will not yield correct results. We show that an edge tax scheme can be combined with a <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> to strictly enforce optimal multicast flows in this more realistic case. If taxes are not desirable, they can be returned to flows while maintaining weak enforcement of the optimal flow.

40|$|A {{short run}} product mix problem {{is used to}} {{illustrate}} the art of consistent framing (Demski 1994). The problem is originally represented as a linear program in the quantities of outputs and inputs. The amount of all inputs used are constrained {{to be less than}} those available. While the problem can be solved without <b>cost</b> <b>allocation,</b> it can be successfully reframed so as to preserve the optimal decision, if the allocation is performed with care. The <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> (reframing) exercise reduces the problem to one in outputs alone with constraints that the amount of inputs that are fixed in the short run be less than those available. Thus, the <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> exercise has the advantage of reducing the dimensionality of the problem {{in terms of the number}} variables and constraints.

A business unit of a large public sector city council in Australia has been studied to empirically examine how strategic <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> is used to prepare a competitive bid in response {{to changes in the}} provision of services according to the National Competition Policy (NCP) guidelines. A case study approach has been used and data have been collected through semi-structured interviews, and study of archival documents. The analysis of the results reveals that strategic <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> can significantly improve the competitive position and productivity of a business unit in the short term. The sources of such improvement stem from the employees’ sense of urgency to improve efficiency reduce slacks in work processes, re-engineering work processes and finally distancing service provision from funding side through an internal purchaser-provider split. The study also reveals that excessive or unfair common <b>cost</b> <b>allocation,</b> used in conjunction with strategic <b>cost</b> <b>allocation,</b> does not change the status quo of the services provided by the monopoly segments. The study, however, does not endorse the long-term use of such strategic <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> because such practice may disadvantage the monopoly segment in terms of cost of service provision or unfairly subjecting services to competition...|$|R

40|$|Background: An {{increase}} in global {{competition and the}} rapid technological change over the last 40 years have led to an expansion {{in the use of}} both financial and nonfinancial information in organizations. Positive and early input from controllers often leads to a more carefully prepared product. This input or evaluation can, for example, concern how the costs are allocated or whether it is possible to lower some of these costs. The question about <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> has been discussed for at least 50 to 60 years, and it is still going on. There are disagreements about whether or not <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> contributes to a more effective and productive organization or whether it has lost its relevance as a control tool. The focus in our thesis will be on <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> to organizational departments within a decentralized organization. Key Question: The use of <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> {{as a part of the}} control package; has it lost its relevance? Purpose: The first purpose is to describe the intentions of <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> within a modern decentralized organization. The thesis will focus on whether <b>cost</b> <b>allocation,</b> as a tool in the control package, gives the desired outcome or whether it has lost its relevance. Through a case study on Handelsbanken AB, we will try to describe the intentions of <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> at top management level. Another purpose is that, from a rational perspective, we will try to analyze whether there is a gap between the intentions at top management level and how it is perceived at lower levels, and if so, whether parts of the gap might be explained through an institutional perspective. Delimitations: In order to contribute to a deeper understanding within the subject of relevance lost regarding <b>cost</b> <b>allocation,</b> our study will describe one organization, Handelsbanken AB.

40|$|A {{growing number}} of studies {{of the issue of}} <b>cost</b> <b>allocations</b> based on {{different}} institutional theories have recently emerged in the management accounting literature. These provide an alternative to efficiency-centred explanations of the evolution of <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> practices and have increasingly drawn attention to the roles of competing interests, power, agency and politics in the more or less continuous (re-) construction of <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> rules. This paper extends this literature by combining an institutional perspective with insights gleaned from the negotiated order (NO) literature, using recent developments in the Swedish university sector as an empirical illustration. This draws attention to the role of negotiations in the political regulation of costing in a highly institutionalised environment. Adopting a comparative, embedded case study design we contrast three recent attempts to re-negotiate <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> rules with varying outcomes. It is concluded that the role of institutional factors as well as socio-political negotiations in framing the ambiguity associated with <b>cost</b> <b>allocations</b> is important in explaining why and how change in <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> rules is mobilised or diverted. Especially, the NO perspective enriches institutional explanations of the stabilising role of power in this respect by drawing attention to how power relationships and coalitions of interests are formed around the specific issues at stake. This leads to a more dynamic and less atomistic conceptualisation of power and agency than in much prior research on the institutionalisation of accounting. ...|$|R
