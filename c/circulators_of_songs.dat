50|$|As a {{countermeasure}} {{against an}} NLJD, professional covert listening devices (bugs) of the Central Intelligence Agency were equipped from 1968 onwards with a so-called isolator. An isolator {{is in fact}} a 3-port <b>circulator</b> <b>of</b> which the return ports is terminated with a resistor. Any energy injected into the bug by an NLJD, will be absorbed by the resistor, resulting in no (or very little) reflected energy. An example of such a bug is the CIA's SRT-107.|$|R

40|$|Chinese {{medicine}} is a faceted field, both multi-disciplinary in academia, and multi-occupational in the praxis {{and education of}} medical treatments. Basic tasks that specialised personnel need to solve include the supply of medicinal drugs and materials, and tackling the multi-ethnic circulation of Chinese materia medica. ‘Chinese medicine and pharmacy’, as this field is frequently called in Chinese, involves the physicians prescribing the ingredients of a formula, and also the constructors and <b>circulators</b> <b>of</b> the ingredients. The pharmaceutical side of Chinese medical culture is the crux of this paper – especially the puzzle of how to best transmit crucial knowledge about the ingredients in a Chinese medical formula...|$|R
5000|$|The former was acceptable, {{because it}} was viewed as merely taking note of the powers in nature that were created by God; for instance, the Anglo-Saxon leechbooks, which {{contained}} simple spells for medicinal purposes, were tolerated. Demonic magic was not acceptable, {{because it was}} believed that such magic did not come from God, but from the Devil and his demons. These grimoires dealt in such topics as necromancy, divination and demonology. Despite this, [...] "there is ample evidence that the mediaeval clergy were the main practitioners of magic and therefore the owners, transcribers, and <b>circulators</b> <b>of</b> grimoires," [...] while several grimoires were attributed to Popes.|$|R

5000|$|The Ted Cruz-Zodiac meme is a mock-conspiracy theory popularized on the Internet by {{opponents of}} Ted Cruz's {{candidacy}} for President in 2015-16. The internet meme facetiously suggested that United States Senator and former 2016 presidential candidate Ted Cruz was the Zodiac Killer, an unidentified Californian serial killer {{of the late}} 1960s and early 1970s. Cruz, born 1970, obviously could not have committed these murders, which began before his birth. <b>Circulators</b> <b>of</b> the meme do not genuinely {{believe that he was}} the Zodiac Killer, citing the absurdity of its premise; NPR wrote that the meme captured [...] "a feeling they have about Cruz: they think he's creepy.

6000|$|Fernando Lopez de Gomara {{first brought}} it forward against Columbus. In {{his history of}} the Indies, {{published}} in 1552, he repeats the rumor in the vaguest terms, manifestly from Oviedo, but without the contradiction given to it by that author. He says that the name and country of the pilot were unknown, some terming him an Andalusian, sailing between the Canaries and Madeira, others a Biscayan, trading to England and France; and others a Portuguese, voyaging between Lisbon and Mina, {{on the coast of}} Guinea. He expresses equal uncertainty whether the pilot brought the caravel to Portugal, to Madeira, or to one of the Azores. The only point on which the <b>circulators</b> <b>of</b> the rumor agreed was, that he died in the house of Columbus. Gomara adds that by this event Columbus was led to undertake his voyage to the new countries. [308] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} was to verify the association between time needed for room cleaning (TLPS) and the surgery size, and related advantages and difficulties faced by the <b>circulator</b> <b>of</b> the room assigned to this task. A mixed method, with a transverse quantitative, retrospective approach, using a sample of 3095 surgeries performed, from January to June 2011, and a qualitative approach using a Thematic Content Analysis of statements from 11 circulators, was used. The average TLPS was smaller in size 1 surgeries, increasing in sizes 2, 3 and 4, with a significant difference. Advantages reported included organization and size of staff, and difficulties reported related to sharp, bladed materials mixed with surgical instruments and a reduced number of cleaning professionals. The larger the size, the higher the TLPS. Surgical teams operating in the Surgical Center interfere directly in the process, facilitating or hindering the achievement of institutional goals related to quality and productivity...|$|R

5000|$|William McMillan, who was {{a member}} of Jefferson College's first graduating class in 1802 and John McMillan's nephew, was elected President on September 24, 1817. [...] He was grave and stern, but not well liked by {{students}} and unable to deal with the problems facing the college. [...] In 1922, five students were brought up on charges of inciting [...] "sedition and rebellion in College" [...] by being [...] "venters and <b>circulators</b> <b>of</b> calumny and slander against the character and reputation of the Principal of this College." [...] These students had signed a petition from members of the Philo and Franklin Literary Societies alleging that McMillan was an inadequate teacher and speaker. [...] In a related charge, another student was accused of writing an article making light of certain religious organizations and scholarships funded by presbyteries. [...] The Trustees declined to pursue the matter and McMillan resigned his office. [...] This incident represented a significant step towards the secularization of the college, as before, earlier students would not have questioned the efficacy of a learned clergyman, nor satirized a religious organization.|$|R
