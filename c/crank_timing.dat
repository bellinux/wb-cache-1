40|$|Motorcycles {{generate}} different sound patterns under dissimilar working conditions. The generated sound pattern gives a clue of the fault. Mainly {{the parts}} of the engine that lead to change in sound are cylinder kit, <b>crank,</b> <b>timing</b> chain, and valve. The parts of the exhaust system that change sound under fault are muffler and silencer. In this study, we analyze the sound signals produced by motorcycles to locate the faults in subsystems. The work proceeds in three stages, the first stage detects the fault, the second stage identifies the faulty subsystem and finally the third stage locates the fault. The overall classification accuracy of the first stage is 0. 8019. The work finds interesting applications in troubleshooting of machinery, electronic gadgets, musical instruments and the like...|$|E
40|$|This project {{studied the}} {{characteristics}} of Homogeneous-Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) combustion near the combustion chamber surfaces using Planar Laser- Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) of the intermediate combustion species formaldehyde. Motivation for this study is a more complete understanding of the thermochemistry associated with HCCI combustion in the thermal boundary layer near the chamber surfaces. Current multi-zone models {{are based on a}} mass distribution defined by predictions of the thermal boundary layers. The engine used for this study was a single-cylinder optically accessible research engine, operating with a compression ratio of 9. 4 : 1, at 600 RPM, with equivalence ratios ranging from 0. 06 to 0. 26 and an intake temperature of 90 �C. Formaldehyde fluorescence was excited by 355 nm light from a pulsed Nd:YAG laser using an innovative through-the-wall approach to avoid vignetting effects. Images were acquired with an intensified CCD camera and post-processing was performed to remove background signal interference. This technique allowed spatial resolution both across the field of view and into the combustion chamber with a resolution of 0. 5 mm at the wall. The data indicate the absence of a strong global thermal stratification effect near the chamber surfaces, with no preferred location for formaldehyde formation or consumption. In all cases, images show a small thermal boundary layer, counter to model predictions. Trends in formaldehyde concentration as a function of <b>crank</b> <b>timing</b> and equivalence ratio were consistent with the literature...|$|E
5000|$|The Tee Dee {{was tested}} by Aeromodeller Magazine in 1962 and the output power was {{recorded}} to be [...]105 bhp (78 watts) @ 22,000 rpm with a max torque of 5.5 oz.in. at 18,000 rpm on 25% Nitro. (Note: The modern Norvel AME 049 engine {{which has an}} aluminum piston running in a ceramic coated cylinder, outputs [...]14 bhp (100 watts)@ 20,000 rpm). In 1973 the bypass porting, <b>crank</b> shaft <b>timing</b> and venturi were modified slightly and a mesh screen {{was added to the}} venturi to keep out dirt. This resulted in a minor performance improvement over the earlier versions.|$|R
5000|$|Compression {{testing is}} a crude form of leak-down testing which also {{includes}} effects due to compression ratio, valve <b>timing,</b> <b>cranking</b> speed, and other factors. Compression tests should normally be done with all spark plugs removed to maximize cranking speed. Cranking compression is a dynamic test of the actual low-speed pumping action, where peak cylinder pressure is measured and stored.|$|R
50|$|N-VCT varies {{valve timing}} by {{rotating}} the affected camshaft(s) {{relative to the}} sprocket; valve lift and duration are not altered. This rotation is achieved when an electric solenoid, controlled by the car's ECU, allows pressurized engine oil to flow into and through the cam and into a slave mechanism, axially advancing cam timing relative to the sprocket. Valve to <b>crank</b> angle <b>timing</b> varies depending on whether engine speed is high or low and changes at fixed intervals. NVTCS is hydraulically actuated similar to Honda’s VTEC system, but adjusts a different aspect of the valve train, so it is more like the I part of I-VTEC. NVTCS equipped Nissan engines do not have as high of engine speeds as VTEC equipped engines so NVTCS is simpler, quieter, and requires no special maintenance. Some Nissan engines only have N-VCT on the intake cam such as the GA16DE, SR20DE/DET (S14-15) or RB25DE/DET (R33-R34 GTS/GTS-T, GT/GTT) while others have it on both the intake and exhaust cams. NVTCS was eventually phased out and replaced by a continuously variable system called CVTCS on newer engines such as the VQ and VK series.|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} reduction of CO 2 emission {{in the road}} transport is a major challenge for next years. In the combination with efficient powertrain technologies, the potential of natural gas is excellent for comparably light and cost effective reduction of CO 2 and toxic emission in the future [1 - 2]. As the CNG fuelling stations in Poland are not so far widespread {{enough to make a}} dedicated natural gas vehicle practical, it results necessary to start with proposing alternatively CNG powered engines. Such a bi-fuel automotive engines are necessary {{to bridge the gap between}} petrol and natural gas. As a sample of modern engine design a Opel 1. 6 liter 4 -cylinder engine has been selected as a base of powertrain for development of bi-fuel passenger car engine. The influence of ignition timing on CNG combustion process has been presented in this paper. An 1. 6 liter SI engine has been tested in the special program. For selected engine operating conditions, following data were acquired: in cylinder pressure, crank angle, fuel mass consumption and exhaust gases temperatures. For the settings of 6, 9, 12 and 15 deg <b>crank</b> angle <b>timing</b> advance correction, the internal temperature of combustion chamber has been estimated, as well as the charge combustion ratio and ratio of heat release were tested. With the help of the mathematical model, emissions of NO, CO and CO 2 were additionally estimated. Obtained results made it possible to compare the influence of ignition timing advance on natural gas combustion in SI engine...|$|R
50|$|In the UK, owners {{left with}} cars with seized engines {{that were going}} nowhere were {{provided}} with a solution by the Hurley Engineering Company. They supplied a torque converter adapter plate and other fittings so that a Ford Essex V4 engine could be fitted in the space left by a removed rotary engine. It was the only engine short enough to fit in the vacated space without modification to the body work. Depending on which Ford model it came from, the engine was available with front or rear sump wells, <b>crank</b> pulley or <b>timing</b> case mounted cooling fan, two capacities and a low compression version for using low grade fuel. In terms of smoothness and refinement, the V4 and the rotary were like chalk and cheese compared to the turbine quality of the rotary engine, but what the V4 did provide was dependability, an increase in torque and an improvement in fuel consumption. Later the Ford V6 was tried but needed body modifications, was thirsty and didn't quite have the right handling balance.|$|R
40|$|This study first {{experimentally}} {{investigates the}} performance and exhausts emissions of a compression ignition (CI) engine fuelled with biodiesel produced from Australian beauty leaf tree (BLT) oil and compares these results with that of petroleum diesel. Then, an engine combustion model is developed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, AVL Fire, to predict the engine performance and emission of those biodiesels and petroleum diesel. Experiments were done according to ISO 8178 standard enginetest procedure using B 5 biodiesel (5 % BLT blend), B 10 (10 % BLT blend) and petroleum diesel in a 4 -cylinderengine test-bed equipped with necessary dynamometer and sensors. The measurements were done for engine power, torque, specific fuel consumption and engine emissions. The combustion model is validated with the experimentally measured data, which shows very good agreement between them, more specifically variation of only up to 4. 4 % in power, 4. 0 % in torque and 3. 3 % in specific fuel consumption was found. The experimental results show that overall B 10 biodiesel provides significantly reducedengine emissions, up to 18 % compared to petroleum diesel. The validated model is then used to optimise the engine performance and emissions {{as a function of}} operating parameters such as ignition <b>timing,</b> <b>crank</b> angles and compression ratios. The simulation results show that B 10 provides a slight improvement in performance and significant reduction in emission. It is believed that this paper provides a solid base of new knowledge towards achieving a sustainable BLT biodiesel industry...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Variable Valve Timing (VVT) presents a powerful tool in the relentless pursuit of efficiency improvements in the internal combustion engine. As the valves have such ultimate control over the gas exchange processes, extensive research effort in this area has shown how valve event timing can be manipulated to reduce engine pumping losses, fuel consumption and engine out emissions. Pumping losses may be significantly reduced by use of throttleless strategies, making use of intake valve duration for load control, while alternative cycles such as the Miller cycle allow modification of the effective compression ratio. More recently, the value of single valve operation in part load conditions is exploited, bringing with it the concept of asymmetric valve lifts. Work in this area found the side effect of asymmetric valve operation is {{a significant change in}} the behaviour of the in-cylinder flow structures, velocities and turbulence intensity. Work presented in this thesis exploits asymmetric valve strategies to modify the in-cylinder flow conditions. The Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is a method employed in the fluids dynamics field to facilitate the separation of coherent motion structures from the turbulence. In the presented work, the application of POD to in-cylinder flow analysis is further developed by the introduction of a novel method for identifying the POD modes representative of coherent motion and those representative of the turbulence. A POD mode correlation based technique is introduced and developed, with the resulting fields showing evidence of coherence and turbulence respectively. Experimental tests are carried out using a full length optically accessible, single cylinder research engine equipped with a fully variable valve train (FVVT) to allow full control of both valve timing and lift. In-cylinder flow is measured through the use of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) at several <b>crank</b> angle <b>timings</b> during the intake stroke whilst the engine is operated under a range of asymmetric valve strategies. The exhaust valves and one intake valve have their respective schedules fixed, while the second intake valve schedule is adjusted to 80 %, 60 %, 40 %, 20 %, 0 % lift. The resulting PIV fields are separated into coherent motion and turbulence using the developed technique, allowing for analysis of each constituent independently. The coherent element gives insight to large scale flows, often of the order of magnitude of the cylinder. These structures not only give a clear indication of the overall motion and allow assessment of flow characteristics such as swirl and tumble ratio, but the variation in the spatial location of these structures provides additional insight to the cyclic to cycle variation (CCV) of the flow, which would not otherwise be possible due to the inclusion of the turbulent data. Similarly, with the cyclic variation removed from the turbulent velocity field, a true account of the fluctuating velocity, u' and derived values such as the Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) may be gained. Results show how manipulation of a one intake valve timing can influence both the large scale motions and the turbulence intensity. By the reduction of lift, the swirl ratio is increased almost linearly as the typical counter-rotating vortex pair becomes asymmetric, before a single vortex structure is observed in the lowest lift cases. A switching mechanism between the two is identified and found to be responsible for increased levels of CCV. With the reduction in lift, TKE is observed not only to increase, but change the spatial distribution of turbulence. Of course, the reduction in valve lift comes with the penalty of a reduced valve curtain area. However, it was identified both in literature and throughout this study that the reduction in lift did not negatively influence the engine breathing as the same trapped mass was achieved under all cases with no adjustment of manifold pressure. While literature shows both bulk motion and turbulence are key in liquid fuel break-up during the intake stroke, the mixing effects under port-injected natural gas were investigated experimentally using Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF). The valve strategy was found to have no significant effect on the mixture distribution at the time of spark...|$|R
