Two Ni-Cr alloys, Co-Cr and Pd-Ag were used. The casting conditions were as follows: electromagnetic induction under argon atmosphere, vac-uum, using blowtorch without atmosphere control. For each condition, 16 specimens, each measuring 25  mm long and 2. 5  mm in diameter, were obtained. Ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation (EL) tests were performed using a Kratos machine. Vickers Microhardness (VM), fracture mode and microstructure were analyzed by SEM. UTS, EL and VM data were statistically analyzed using ANOVA. For UTS, alloy com-position had a direct influence on casting condition of alloys (Wiron 99 and Remanium CD), with higher values shown when cast with Flame/Air (p <  0. 05). The factors “alloy ” and “casting condition ” influenced the EL and VM results, generally presenting opposite results, i. e., alloy with high elongation value had lower hardness (Wiron 99), and casting condi-tion with the lowest EL values had the highest VM values (blowtorch).

Fortunately, the esthetic qualities of ceramic materials can be combined with the strength and toughness of metals to produce restorations that have both natural tooth like appearance and very good mechanical properties. Since <b>ceramic</b> <b>alloys</b> are subjected to heat treatment during porcelain application, mechanical tests of such alloys should be performed with heat treatment as an experimental variable. Therefore, it was the aim of the present study to investigate the effect of simulated porcelain firing cycles on the ultimate tensile strength, ductility and estimated toughness of a Ni-Cr and a Co-Cr <b>ceramic</b> <b>alloys.</b> The microstructural changes of each alloy as a consequence to the heat treatment were also studied. Thirty tensile specimens of each alloy were cast. The specimens were divided into six groups having five specimens in each. Group 1 (Control) : the specimens were kept in the as-cast condition. In groups II-VI, a standard heat treatment simulating porcelain firing was performed. Group II was subjected to four firing cycles representing preoxidation, opaque application, body application and glaze. Groups III-VI were subjected to 5, 6, 7 and 8 firing cycles where the extra cycles represented porcelain body corrections. Tensile testing was carried out on a universal testing machine and the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and percentage elongation were calculated. The toughness values were estimated by multiplying the percentage elongation by their corresponding UTS values. Photomicrographs of the microstructure were obtained after etching of the specimens of each alloy utilizing its specific metallurgic etchant. The results showed that heat treatment simulating porcelain firing was not a significant variable for both the UTS of the investigated Ni-Cr alloy, and the percentage elongation of the investigated Co-Cr alloy. On the contrary the estimated toughness values were markedly reduced following heat treatment simulating porcelain firing.

40|$|Modern {{applications}} of refractory ceramic thin films, predominantly as wear-protective coatings on cutting tools and on components utilized in automotive engines, require {{a combination of}} excellent mechanical properties, thermal stability, and oxidation resistance. Conventional design approaches for transition metal nitride coatings with improved thermal and chemical stability are based on alloying with Al. It {{is well known that}} the solubility of Al in NaCl-structure transition metal nitrides is limited. Hence, the great challenge is to increase the Al concentration substantially while avoiding precipitation of the thermodynamically favored wurtzite-AlN phase, which is detrimental to mechanical properties. Here, we use VAlN as a model system to illustrate a new concept for the synthesis of metastable single-phase NaCl-structure thin films with the Al content far beyond solubility limits obtained with conventional plasma processes. This supersaturation is achieved by separating the film-forming species in time and energy domains through synchronization of the 70 -mu s-long pulsed substrate bias with intense periodic fluxes of energetic Al+ metal ions during reactive hybrid high power impulse magnetron sputtering of the Al target and direct current magnetron sputtering of the V target in the Ar/N- 2 gas mixture. Hereby, Al is subplanted into the cubic VN grains formed by the continuous flux of low-energy V neutrals. We show that Al subplantation enables an unprecedented 42 % increase in metastable Al solubility limit in V 1 -xAlxN, from x- 0. 52 obtained with the conventional method to 0. 75. The elastic modulus is 325 +/- 5 GPa, in excellent agreement with density functional theory calculations, and approximately 50 % higher than for corresponding films grown by dc magnetron sputtering. The extension of the presented strategy to other Al-ion-assisted vapor deposition methods or materials systems is straightforward, which opens up the way for producing supersaturated single-phase functional <b>ceramic</b> <b>alloy</b> thin films combining excellent mechanical properties with high oxidation resistance.

For species that have higher solubility in the liquid than in the solid phase, segregation by ``zone refinement`` from multiple passes by a solidification front to the surface results in surface enrichment of those species.
