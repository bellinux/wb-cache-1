50|$|Between 1988 and 1992, the Digital Equipment team {{approached}} more {{telecommunications equipment}} manufacturers (including Siemens ROLM {{and the former}} AT&T, whose Definity PBX product line is now owned by Avaya) and implemented the additional protocols needed to interoperate with their telephone systems. However, it quickly {{became clear that the}} number of proprietary protocols was becoming unmanageable. Call models differed between telephone systems, making it difficult to write CTI-enabled application software. The need for a standardized cross-vendor CTI <b>call</b> <b>model</b> and supporting protocol was becoming apparent.|$|E
50|$|A {{group of}} {{computer}} and telecommunications equipment vendors {{interested in this}} problem approached the European Computer Manufacturers’ Association (now simply known as ECMA) with a proposal to undertake this standardization. The proposal was accepted and Robert Roden, an architect from the Digital Equipment technical team, was chosen as convenor (chairperson) for the standards work. Phase I (the first edition) of CSTA was released in 1992. The CSTA standard has since progressed through several editions, incorporating technologies such as voice response and XML. Each Phase of the CSTA standard includes both a <b>call</b> <b>model</b> {{as well as a}} recommended set of communication protocols.|$|E

40|$|Internet based {{call control}} Web {{services}} enable telecommunications network operators to offerWeb developers a simplified method of controlling telecommunication resources. Web Services that expose telecommunication networks to third parties are highly abstracted. This abstraction allows Web developers to create applications that provide call control functionality without detailed {{knowledge of the}} underlying network. Functionality offered by network operators is usually of a simple nature, and does not provide developers with advanced call control functionality, similar to that found in operator services. Advanced call control requires the Web application to have detailed knowledge {{of the state of}} the telecommunication resources. In this research an Extended Call Control <b>call</b> <b>model</b> and Extended Call Control Web service are developed and demonstrated to provide Web applications with this knowledge. To develop the Extended Call Control <b>call</b> <b>model</b> existing telecommunication call models were analysed for components suitable for Web control. The Extended Call Control Web service was developed using advanced call control use cases. The proof of concept successfully demonstrates the use of the Extended Call Control Web service and the value of the Extended Call Control <b>call</b> <b>model</b> in proving asynchronous Web based advanced call control of telecommunications resources. This research has developed a novel <b>call</b> <b>model</b> for Web based call control of telecommunications networks. The Extended Call Control <b>call</b> <b>model</b> and API fulfils a fundamental requirement for Web based advanced call control, namely knowledge {{of the state of the}} underlying network and asynchronous control of those resources. This research facilitates the development of advancedWeb applications controlling telecommunications calls within the network which previously was limited by the knowledge of the network state. Telecommunication service applications can be moved from tightly coupled systems within the operators network to Web based applications within third party domains such as a Internet based virtual private branch exchange or call centre...|$|E

30|$|Tested using {{monte carlo}} {{simulation}} based hypothetical case, the model shows a different result from classical real options <b>call</b> <b>model.</b> This is mainly due to franchise contractual arrangement, where royalty fee lower the threshold of acquisition cost in converting the franchise outlet to company owned.|$|E
30|$|In this study, {{franchise}} ownership redirection using a real options {{framework is}} formulated. The {{uniqueness of the}} franchise acquisition model compared to a classical real options <b>call</b> <b>model</b> is that the franchisor receives income as royalty fee even before the option is exercised. This income will decrease {{the threshold of the}} acquisition cost, which will increase the value of the real options. Thus, unlike the classical real options <b>call</b> <b>model</b> where the decision maker only compares the stochastic income after the acquisition to the constant acquisition price, in this model, the franchisors have to consider the income before the acquisition (royalty fee) as a tradeoff with the extra risk of running their own units in the form of agency costs.|$|E
