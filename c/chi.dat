5|$|At {{one point}} Hideki {{considers}} {{having to take}} on a second job due to his poor financial state. He is eventually able to convince his former employer Hiroyasu Ueda to hire <b>Chi</b> at his bakery during his anniversary sale. <b>Chi</b> eventually finds herself kidnapped by Yoshiyuki Kojima. Yoshiyuki initiates a program that he had created especially for <b>Chi,</b> which is designed to break through her firewalls, and when he embraces and gropes her, Freya intervenes by binding him with wires connected to <b>Chi</b> and releasing a powerful, concussive blast. Hideki and Shinbo find her, and Freya vanishes, causing <b>Chi</b> to collapse from the energy used. She recovers and briefly reunites with Hideki, before losing consciousness. Shinbo then forces Yoshiyuki to transfer his persocom Kotoko's registration to Hideki to prevent Yoshiyuki from deleting her memories, so that a record of his kidnapping exists.|$|E

5|$|Freya {{explains}} how {{she came to}} inhabit Chi's body. She reveals that she and <b>Chi</b> merely switched places inside the body, but <b>Chi</b> has shut herself away and Freya cannot contact her. Hideki asks why, and Freya explains that <b>Chi</b> discovered there were certain things that humans could do that she could not, leading her to believe that while Hideki would love her, it would make her existence unbearable. Hideki protests that it would not, but Freya tells him that <b>Chi</b> thought otherwise. She then tells Chitose {{that the time has}} come to destroy both of them, and she reluctantly agrees. Against Hideki's protestations, she deactivates Freya. <b>Chi,</b> however, has survived the deactivation and comes to the conclusion that while life with Hideki may seem painful because of her limitations, it is even more painful without him. She regains control of her body and completes her program, giving every persocom the ability to love then embraces Hideki.|$|E
5|$|In the Book of Kells, the <b>Chi</b> Rho {{monogram}} {{has grown}} to consume the entire page. The letter <b>chi</b> dominates the page with one arm swooping across {{the majority of the}} page.

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century the fraternity system continued to expand at such a rapid pace that university newspapers questioned if the increase in the number of fraternities would ever end.

40|$|Corticostriatal {{regulation}} of striatal dopamine (DA) transmission {{has long been}} postulated, but ionotropic glutamate receptors have not been localized directly to DA axons. Striatal cholinergic interneurons (<b>ChIs)</b> are emerging as major players in striatal function, and can govern DA transmission by activating nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) on DA axons. Cortical inputs to <b>ChIs</b> have historically been perceived as sparse, but recent evidence indicates that they strongly activate <b>ChIs.</b> We explored whether activation of M 1 /M 2 corticostriatal inputs can consequently gate DA transmission, via <b>ChIs.</b> We reveal that optogenetic activation of channelrhodopsin-expressing corticostriatal axons can drive striatal DA release detected with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry and requires activation of nAChRs on DA axons and AMPA receptors on <b>ChIs</b> that promote short-latency action potentials. By contrast, DA release driven by optogenetic activation of intralaminar thalamostriatal inputs involves additional activation of NMDA receptors on <b>ChIs</b> and action potential generation over longer timescales. Therefore, cortical and thalamic glutamate inputs can modulate DA transmission by regulating <b>ChIs</b> as gatekeepers, through ionotropic glutamate receptors. The different use of AMPA and NMDA receptors by cortical versus thalamic inputs might lead to distinct input integration strategies by <b>ChIs</b> and distinct modulation of the function of DA and striatum. </p...|$|R
5|$|Mortal Kombat X sees Shinnok and Quan <b>Chi</b> {{enacting}} their plan, leading {{an army of}} undead revenants {{of those}} that were killed in Shao Kahn's invasion against the realms. A team of warriors led by Raiden, Johnny Cage, and Sonya Blade oppose Shinnok, and in the ensuing battle, Shinnok is imprisoned, Quan <b>Chi</b> escapes, and various warriors are resurrected and freed from Shinnok's thrall. Twenty-five years later, Quan <b>Chi</b> resurfaces and allies himself with the insect-like D'Vorah in manipulating events that lead to Shinnok's release. Though Quan <b>Chi</b> is killed by a vengeful Scorpion in the process, Shinnok resumes his assault against the realms. After a grueling, protracted battle, Shinnok is defeated by Cassandra Cage representing {{the next generation of}} Earthrealm's warriors. With both Quan <b>Chi</b> and Shinnok gone, the undead revenants of Liu Kang and Kitana assume control of the Netherrealm and Lord Raiden now protects the Earthrealm not defensively but offensively {{with the help of the}} remaining revenants.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{suitability}} of using clinical assessment to identify patients with podoconiosis in endemic communities {{has previously been}} demonstrated. In this study, we explored the feasibility and accuracy of using Community Health Implementers (<b>CHIs)</b> for the large scale clinical screening of the population for podoconiosis in North-west Cameroon. METHODS: Before a regional podoconiosis mapping, 193 <b>CHIs</b> and 50 health personnel selected from 6 health districts were trained in the clinical diagnosis of the disease. After training, <b>CHIs</b> undertook community screening for podoconiosis patients under health personnel supervision. Identified cases were later re-examined by a research team with experience in the clinical identification of podoconiosis. RESULTS: Cases were identified by <b>CHIs</b> with an overall positive predictive value (PPV) of 48. 5...|$|R

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the series, Zima and Dita, persocom {{agents for}} the Japanese {{government}} who know the outcome of Chi's special program, arrive at Hideki's apartment. A minor scuffle ensues between Dita and <b>Chi,</b> before Zima restrains Dita, wishing to see the outcome of Hideki's decision and ultimately too falling under Chi's influence. Hideki confirms his love for <b>Chi,</b> only to find that Freya has taken control of her body. Learning that he that he can never engage in sexual intercourse with <b>Chi</b> without rebooting her systems, erasing everything that makes her a unique individual, Hideki states that he will love <b>Chi</b> regardless. Freya confirms that while <b>Chi</b> and herself are indeed the legendary Chobits, they possess neither sentience nor emotions, but rely on software programs just like every persocom. Again, Hideki stands by his love for <b>Chi.</b> Hideki declines her offer to tell him about Chi's special ability, and Freya vanishes after imploring him {{to take care of her}} sister. <b>Chi</b> awakens, embracing Hideki. The series ends with <b>Chi</b> holding Hideki's hand with visible rings <b>Chi</b> had chosen for the two of them.|$|E

40|$|Ras homolog {{enriched in}} {{striatum}} (Rhes) is highly expressed in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of rodents. In the present study, we characterized {{the expression of}} Rhes mRNA across species, {{as well as its}} functional role in other striatal neuron subtypes. Double in situ hybridization analysis showed that Rhes transcript is selectively localized in striatal cholinergic interneurons (<b>ChIs),</b> but not in GABAergic parvalbumin- or in neuropeptide Y-positive cell populations. Rhes is closely linked to dopamine-dependent signaling. Therefore, we recorded <b>ChIs</b> activity in basal condition and following dopamine receptor activation. Surprisingly, instead of an expected dopamine D 2 receptor (D 2 R) -mediated inhibition, we observed an aberrant excitatory response in <b>ChIs</b> from Rhes knockout mice. Conversely, the effect of D 1 R agonist on <b>ChIs</b> was less robust in Rhes mutants than in controls. Although Rhes deletion in mutants occurs throughout the striatum, we demonstrate that the D 2 R response is altered specifically in <b>ChIs,</b> since it was recorded in pharmacological isolation, and prevented either by intrapipette BAPTA or by GDP-β-S. Moreover, we show that blockade of Cav 2. 2 calcium channels prevented the abnormal D 2 R response. Finally, we found that the abnormal D 2 R activation in <b>ChIs</b> was rescued by selective PI 3 K inhibition thus suggesting that Rhes functionally modulates PI 3 K/Akt signaling pathway in these neurons. Our findings reveal that, besides its expression in MSNs, Rhes is localized also in striatal <b>ChIs</b> and, most importantly, lack of this G-protein, significantly alters D 2 R modulation of striatal cholinergic excitability...|$|R
