25|$|Diwani is a cursive {{style of}} Arabic {{calligraphy}} {{developed during the}} reign of the early Ottoman Turks in the 16th and early 17th centuries. It was invented by Housam Roumi and reached its height of popularity under Süleyman I the Magnificent (1520–1566). Spaces between letters are often narrow, and lines ascend upwards from right to left. Larger variations called djali are filled with dense decorations of dots and diacritical marks in the space between, giving it a compact appearance. Diwani is difficult to read and write due to its heavy stylization, and became ideal script for writing court documents as it ensured <b>confidentiality</b> <b>and</b> prevented forgery.|$|E

25|$|Homeless {{enumeration}} counts are {{mandated by}} HUD for all jurisdictions participating in HUD Continuum of Care grant programs. These occur {{as frequently as}} every two years. More recently, organizations such as Common Ground have compiled Vulnerability Indexes which prioritize homeless persons. The factors include the existence of late stage terminal disease, HIV-AIDS, kidney or liver disease, frequent hospitalizations and frequent emergency room visits. The data which is compiled which exceeds the BUD mandate is retained and held confidential by Common Ground. Advocates of the system claim high rates of success in placing the most vulnerable persons, but skeptics remain concerned with <b>confidentiality</b> <b>and</b> security issues.|$|E
25|$|The Twelve Traditions {{encourage}} {{members to}} practice the spiritual principle of anonymity in the public media and members are also asked to respect each others' confidentiality. This is a group norm, however, and not legally mandated; there are no legal consequences to discourage those attending twelve-step groups from revealing information disclosed during meetings. Statutes on group therapy do not encompass those associations that lack a professional therapist or clergyman to whom <b>confidentiality</b> <b>and</b> privilege might apply. Professionals and paraprofessionals who refer patients to these groups, to avoid both civil liability and licensure problems, have been advised that they should alert their patients that, at any time, their statements made in meetings may be disclosed.|$|E
25|$|Marx {{also argues}} that, insofar as {{capitalist}} class society is intrinsically a very contradictory system – it contains many conflicting and competing forces – the masking of its true characteristics becomes an integral feature {{of how it}} actually operates. Buyers and sellers compete with other buyers and sellers. Businesses cannot practically do so without <b>confidentiality</b> <b>and</b> secrecy. Workers compete for job opportunities and access to resources. Capitalists and workers compete for {{their share of the}} new wealth that is produced, and nations compete with other nations. The masks are therefore not optional, but necessary, and the more one is able to know about others, the more subtle, ingenious and sophisticated the masks become.|$|E

25|$|Data mining {{requires}} {{data preparation}} which can uncover information or patterns which may compromise <b>confidentiality</b> <b>and</b> privacy obligations. A common way {{for this to}} occur is through data aggregation. Data aggregation involves combining data together (possibly from various sources) {{in a way that}} facilitates analysis (but that also might make identification of private, individual-level data deducible or otherwise apparent). This is not data mining per se, but a result of the preparation of data before – and for the purposes of – the analysis. The threat to an individual's privacy comes into play when the data, once compiled, cause the data miner, or anyone who has access to the newly compiled data set, to be able to identify specific individuals, especially when the data were originally anonymous.|$|E
25|$|A {{trade secret}} is {{information}} that is intentionally kept confidential and that provides a competitive advantage to its possessor. Trade secrets are protected by non-disclosure agreement and labour law, each of which prevents information leaks such as breaches of <b>confidentiality</b> <b>and</b> industrial espionage. Compared to patents, the advantages of trade secrets are {{that the value of}} a trade secret continues until it is made public, whereas a patent is only in force for a specified time, after which others may freely copy the invention; does not require payment of fees to governmental agencies or filing paperwork; has an immediate effect; and does not require any disclosure of information to the public. The key disadvantage of a trade secret is its vulnerability to reverse engineering.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theme is}} <b>confidentiality</b> <b>and</b> {{this is an}} {{important}} principle in many nursing ethical codes. This is where information about the person is only shared with others after permission of the person, unless it is felt that the information must be shared to comply with a higher duty such as preserving life. Related to information giving is the debate relating to truth telling in interactions with the person in care. There is a balance between people having the information required to make an autonomous decision and, on the other hand, not being unnecessarily distressed by the truth. Generally the balance is in favour of truth telling due to respect for autonomy, but sometimes people will ask not to be told, or may lack the capacity to understand the implications. Finally, the role of empirical ethics has become prominent in recent years.|$|E

25|$|One of Harvey's major {{tasks as}} Health Minister was {{to deal with}} the government's {{response}} to the growing AIDS crisis. The issue had been essentially ignored under Bjelke-Petersen, but under the more moderate Ahern, Harvey was tasked with taking steps to begin to address the disease. To this extent, she oversaw the legalisation of condom vending machines and needle exchanges, and instituted a program of AIDS education in schools. These steps were seen by some as inadequate, and her role was undermined by her poor relationship with the homosexual community. These issues came to a head in March 1988 when Harvey put out a departmental memo insisting that she be given unrestricted access to the medical records of AIDS patients, sparking a bitter battle over patient <b>confidentiality,</b> <b>and</b> repeated Opposition calls for her to be removed from the portfolio.|$|E
25|$|The Swedish court's {{decision}} {{to grant the}} two critics access to the data was controversial. When the study participants were contacted by Gillberg {{and asked if they}} would be prepared to have the data released, all but one family refused. Citing that, and the promise of confidentiality given to the participants as a precondition, Gillberg and the other researchers decided to not turn over the personal data. 267 Swedish doctors signed a letter in support of Gillberg's {{decision to}} not hand over the data. After the verdict, the chairman of the Central Ethical Review Board of Sweden, Johan Munch, said that in Swedish legislation, the Principle of Public Access is incompatible with promises of absolute <b>confidentiality,</b> <b>and</b> that the Central Ethical Review Board therefore no longer approves such promises. According to Martin Ingvar of the Karolinska Institute, medical researchers in Sweden will be forced to change the current practice because of the verdict. Ingvar told media that medical studies in Sweden must now adhere to a strict anonymization encoding, even in extensive studies like Gillberg's which contain large amounts of clinical material collected over long periods of time, in spite of the increase in cost and the larger margins of error.|$|E

Methods: Mental health professionals (n= 121) who were members of the Delhi Psychiatric Society, were invited to participate in this questionnaire-based study of their knowledge and attitudes regarding informed consent <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality.</b> Half of them expressed willingness to discuss participation and gave initial oral consent (n= 62); of these, 31 gave written informed consent to participate and completed the questionnaires.

Questionnaires content reflected prominent guidelines on informed consent <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality</b> protection. Results: Attitudes {{of the majority of the}} participants towards informed consent <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality</b> were in line with ethical principles and guidelines.

500|$|Research psychologists Kassin and Wrightsman {{indicate}} that the model employed (demographic factors predict attitudes that predict verdicts) has empirical weaknesses. That attitudes predict verdicts is taken for granted and rarely studied. For example, veterans might favor current troops, {{but that does not}} necessarily translate into a likelihood to acquit their brethren of crimes. However, the relationship between demographics and verdicts can be more reliably predicted by mock trials. Successful prediction of jury verdicts often requires data specific to the case and jurisdiction. The sheer number of ways that one case can be unique outstrips the published research on the subject, so original research is often required. That necessity is exacerbated by the fact that many modern consultants are reluctant to share knowledge, even with other firms, because of paranoia, client <b>confidentiality,</b> <b>and</b> their regard for their work as [...] "trade secrets".|$|E
500|$|HD is {{typically}} inherited from a person's parents, with 10% of cases {{due to a}} new mutation. The disease is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in either of an individual's two copies of a gene called Huntingtin. This means a child of an affected person typically has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The Huntingtin gene provides the genetic information for a protein that is also called [...] "huntingtin". Expansion of CAG (cytosine-adenine-guanine) triplet repeats in the gene coding for the Huntingtin protein results in an abnormal protein, which gradually damages cells in the brain, through mechanisms that are not fully understood. Diagnosis is by genetic testing, which {{can be carried out}} at any time, {{regardless of whether or not}} symptoms are present. This fact raises several ethical debates: the age at which an individual is considered mature enough to choose testing; whether parents have the right to have their children tested; and managing <b>confidentiality</b> <b>and</b> disclosure of test results.|$|E
