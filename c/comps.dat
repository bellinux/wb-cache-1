500|$|Shin Megami Tensei If... was {{developed}} as a spin-off from the main series. Its smaller world scope came about because the game's director Kouji Okada felt he had reached the limit of {{what he could do}} with large-scale worlds in the previous Shin Megami Tensei games. The main concept was for a high school setting rendered in three dimensions where a portal to hell would open, creating a more self-contained adventure. The modelling for Karukozaka High School was based on pictures from writer Ryutaro Ito's school album as they had no other visual resources. The project's working title was Shin Megami Tensei X. The Partner system was divided into main and sub categories, with three to four playable characters available. The ability for sub characters to wield <b>COMPs</b> and need to be rescued was planned, but both were rejected. The Guardian system was designed by future Megami Tensei director Katsura Hashino. The game's music was written by Tsukasa Masuko. One of the game's main themes, the Karukozaka High School school song heard during the ending, had lyrics written by Ito, who based them on the lyrics of his own school's song. Masuko was unimpressed when Ito asked for the lyrics {{to be added to the}} song. While only one line is ever heard in-game, Ito created three lines. If... was completed in a very short span of time, so much so that in 2003 Okada later described the development time as being [...] "unthinkable" [...] for any developer.|$|E

The present {{study was designed to}} investigate the effect of transform-ing growth factor β (TGFβ) on <b>COMP</b> deposition and the influence of <b>COMP</b> on collagen biochemistry in a long-term 3 -dimensional culture. Bovine chondrocytes in alginate beads were cultured with or without 25 ng/mL TGFβ 2 for 21 or 35 days. <b>COMP</b> was overexpressed in bovine chondrocytes using lentiviral transfection. <b>COMP</b> gene expression, <b>COMP</b> protein production, collagen and proteoglycan deposition, and collagen fibril thickness were determined.

Overexpression of <b>COMP</b> did not affect the deposition of collagen, collagen cross-linking, proteoglycan deposition, or the mechanical properties.

The goal {{of this study was}} to assess the ability of a hammerhead ribozyme (Ribo 56, designed against the D 469 del mutation) to reduce <b>COMP</b> mRNA expression. In COS 7 cells transfected with plasmids that overexpress wild-type or mutant <b>COMP</b> mRNA and Ribo 56, the ribozyme reduced overexpressed normal <b>COMP</b> mRNA by 46 % and mutant <b>COMP</b> mRNA by 56 % in a dose-dependent manner. Surprisingly, the use of recombinant adenoviruses to deliver wild-type or mutant <b>COMP</b> mRNA and Ribo 56 simultaneously into COS 7 cells proved problematic for the activity of the ribozyme to reduce <b>COMP</b> expression. However, in normal human costochondral cells (hCCCs) infected only with adenoviruses expressing Ribo 56, expression of endogenous wild-type <b>COMP</b> mRNA was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by 50 %. In chondrocytes that contain heterozygous <b>COMP</b> mutations (D 469 del, G 427 E and D 511 Y) that cause PSACH, Ribo 56 was more effective at reducing <b>COMP</b> mRNA (up to 70 %). These results indicate that Ribo 56 is effective at reducing mutant and wild-type <b>COMP</b> levels in cells and suggests a possible mode of therapy to reduce the mutant protein load...|$|R
