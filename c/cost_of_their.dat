5|$|In a liberalised energy market, investors, {{operators}} and consumers should face the full <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> decisions. But {{this is not}} the case in many economies or energy sectors. Many policies distort the market in favour of existing fossil fuel technologies.|$|E
5|$|Members of the cofradía met monthly on the 19th day {{to honor}} the feast of Saint Joseph. They also paid monthly fees of one real to cover the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> monthly Masses and fiestas.

5|$|After Cimon's ostracism, Pericles {{continued}} {{to promote a}} populist social policy. He first proposed a decree that permitted the poor to watch theatrical plays without paying, with the state covering the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> admission. With other decrees he lowered the property requirement for the archonship in 458–457 BC and bestowed generous wages on all citizens who served as jurymen in the Heliaia (the supreme court of Athens) some time just after 454BC. His most controversial measure, however, was a law of 451 BC limiting Athenian citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides.|$|E

5|$|However, {{their larger}} sizes and very {{aggressive}} behavior also {{make them a}} serious threat to native species of skeleton shrimp. A study in 2009 on the native populations of Caprella linearis, a smaller caprellid species in the Helgoland region of the German Bight in the North Sea, have revealed that C. linearis have more or less vanished and have been replaced by C. mutica. C. mutica fouling populations may also incur minor economic effects through the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> removal from submerged aquaculture equipment and ship hulls.|$|E
5|$|The new {{officers}} {{hired in}} the wake of the strike received higher salaries and more vacation days than the strikers had. They enjoyed a starting salary of $1,400 along with a pension plan, and the department covered the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> uniforms and equipment. The population of Boston raised $472,000 to help pay for the State Guards until new police officers could be recruited.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{legislative}} walkouts, the assembly began passing {{most of the}} agenda and Daniels signed the bills into law. Written in collaboration with Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Bennett, a series of education reform laws made a variety of major changes to statewide public schools. A statewide school voucher program was enacted. Children in homes with an income under $41,000 could receive vouchers equal to 90% of the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> public school tuition and use that money to attend a private school. It provides lesser benefits to households with income over $41,000. The program will be gradually phased in {{over a three-year period}} and would be available to all state residents by 2014.|$|E

5|$|In , Sora's group stumbles upon a {{fortress}} known as Castle Oblivion, believing {{they will find}} Mickey and Riku inside. There, Sora's memories are manipulated by a girl named Naminé, who is being held captive by the group Organization XIII and forced to replace his memories of Kairi with herself. However, as Sora ascends the castle, he meets Naminé and learns the truth from her. Sora still wishes to protect Naminé and stop the Organization members in the castle. After Sora and friends defeat the Organization members controlling the castle, Naminé helps the three restore their memories to their state prior to entering Castle Oblivion, at the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> memories of {{the events in the}} castle. This requires them to sleep in the castle for the restoration of memories to be completed.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 October 1916, a fire was {{discovered}} in the Imperatritsa Mariyas forward powder magazine while at anchor in Sevastopol, but it exploded before any efforts {{could be made to}} fight the fire. Sailors led by Engineer-Mechanic Midshipman Ignatyev, however, managed to flood the forward shell magazine before the explosion at the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own lives. Their action probably prevented a catastrophic detonation {{and all of the other}} magazines were flooded as a precaution. About forty minutes after the first explosion, a second occurred in the vicinity of the torpedo compartment that destroyed the watertight integrity of the rest of the forward bulkheads. Imperatritsa Mariya began to sink by the bow and listed to starboard. She capsized a few minutes later, taking 228 sailors with her. The subsequent investigation determined that the explosion was probably the result of spontaneous combustion of the nitrocellulose-based propellant as it decomposed.|$|E
5|$|The main {{striking}} {{force of the}} Parthian army was its cataphracts, heavy cavalry with man and horse decked in mailed armor. The cataphracts were equipped with a lance for charging into enemy lines, but were not equipped with bows and arrows which were restricted to horse archers. Due to the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> equipment and armor, cataphracts were recruited from among the aristocratic class who, {{in return for their}} services, demanded a measure of autonomy at the local level from the Arsacid kings. The light cavalry was recruited from among the commoner class and acted as horse archers; they wore a simple tunic and trousers into battle. They used composite bows and were able to shoot at enemies while riding and facing away from them; this technique, known as the Parthian shot, was a highly effective tactic.|$|E
50|$|Businesses {{are faced}} with paying the {{significant}} and rising healthcare <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> employees.

40|$|Academic institutions, {{including}} {{colleges of}} pharmacy, are often required {{to analyze the}} <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> educational programs. This has become particularly evident for colleges planning the imple-mentation of entry-level PharmD programs. The Institutional Research Advisory Committee of AACP has considered ways to assist member colleges in conducting <b>cost</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>their</b> pro-grams and has prepared this report on cost analysis methods for use by interested colleges. The purpose of this report is to briefly describe some of the commonly used strategies and, when appro-priate, underscore the advantages and limitations {{of each of these}} strategies. Examples illustrating each of the strategies are also presented. It is important to emphasize that these examples should not be used as estimates of pharmacy education program costs but rather as models to be used by colleges to estimate the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own programs...|$|R
5|$|For the {{purposes}} of analysis, {{it is possible to}} separate efficiency (achieving a given objective at lowest cost) and equity (fairness). Economists generally agree that to regulate emissions efficiently, all polluters need to face the full <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> actions (that is, the full marginal social <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> actions). Regulation <b>of</b> emissions that is applied only to one economic sector or region drastically reduces the efficiency of efforts to reduce global emissions. There is, however, no scientific consensus over how to share the <b>costs</b> and benefits <b>of</b> reducing future climate change (mitigation of climate change), or the <b>costs</b> and benefits <b>of</b> adapting to any future climate change (see also economics of global warming).|$|R
5|$|Creatures are {{attracted}} via Portals. Which ones come {{depend on the}} dungeon's composition. Each has its own abilities (such as spells they can cast), expertise, and job preferences. Creatures include Bile Demons, Warlocks, and Salamanders. Like the first game, creatures can be slapped with the hand to make them work harder, at the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> health. Certain creatures, such as Vampires and Skeletons cannot be attracted via Portals. They are obtained by their corpse decomposing in a Graveyard, and dying in captivity respectively. Certain sacrifices in the Temple, a room where creatures pray, also yield the acquisition of certain creatures. Creatures frequently enter combat (each follow one of four combat strategies) against creatures belonging to enemy keepers, or heroic forces defending the realm. Heroes enter the level via Hero Gates. The heroics forces are composed of different units to keepers: heroes include Wizards, Giants, and Guards. Most creatures have a heroic counterpart: for example, the Wizard is the counterpart of the Warlock. Heroes and rival keepers' creatures {{can be converted to}} the player's cause in the torture chamber after being captured and imprisoned. Creatures dislike their heroic counterparts, and their company may make them angry, which can lead to rebellions. Rebelling creatures either leave the dungeon, or defect to another keeper or the heroes, and may take other creatures too. Other things that can annoy creatures and cause rebellions include lack of food, not getting paid (creatures require payment on a regular basis), and being slapped.|$|E
