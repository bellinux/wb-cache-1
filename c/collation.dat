5|$|The Epistles of Clement of {{the codex}} were {{published}} in 1633 by Patrick Young, the Royal Librarian. A <b>collation</b> was made by Alexander Huish, Prebendary of Wells, for the London Polyglot Bible (1657). The text of the manuscript was cited as footnotes.

5|$|The first <b>collation</b> of the New Testament {{was made}} in 1716 by Johann Jakob Wettstein for Richard Bentley, who {{intended}} to prepare a new edition of the Novum Testamentum Graece.

5|$|In 1809 Napoleon {{brought the}} {{manuscript}} {{as a victory}} trophy to Paris, but in 1815 it was returned to the Vatican Library. During that time, in Paris, German scholar Johann Leonhard Hug (1765–1846) saw it. Hug examined it, together with other worthy treasures of the Vatican, {{but he did not}} perceive the need of a new and full <b>collation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Knittel {{made many}} errors, {{especially}} in Latin text, {{he also did}} not decipher every word and left several lacunae in the reconstructed text (e.g. Romans 11:35; 12:2; 15:8). Tischendorf made {{a new and more}} accurate <b>collation</b> for the Latin text and edited in 1855. Tischendorf used abbreviations for the nomina sacra, he did not leave any lacunae.|$|E

25|$|Until 1994 ch {{was also}} {{treated as a}} single letter in Spanish <b>collation</b> order, {{inserted}} between C and D; in this way, mancha was after manco and before manda. There was similar special treatment for ll. However, an April 1994 vote in the 10th Congress of the Association of Spanish Language Academies adopted the standard international <b>collation</b> rules, so ch is now considered a sequence of two distinct characters, and dictionaries now place words starting with ch- between those starting with cg- and ci-. Similarly, mancha now precedes manco in alphabetical order.|$|E

The notes, though already collected by Paul Schroeder {{in the second}} half of the 19 th century, were now re-examined by Vinko Hinz and are here published and analysed for the first time. They consist of <b>collations,</b> short discussions and conjectures. While the <b>collations</b> and discussions are mainly interesting for the history of Classical Philology, Bentley’s conjectures show his brilliant insight into the problems of the text and can still be of use to readers and editors...|$|R
25|$|From Islamic Spain, the Arabic {{philosophical}} {{literature was}} translated into Hebrew, Latin, and Ladino. The Jewish philosopher Moses Maimonides, Muslim sociologist-historian Ibn Khaldun, Carthage citizen Constantine the African who translated Greek medical texts, and Al-Khwarizmi's <b>collation</b> of mathematical techniques were important figures of the Golden Age.|$|E
25|$|A signature, in {{the context}} of printed books, is a section that {{contains}} text. Though the term signature technically refers to the signature mark, traditionally a letter or number printed on the first leaf of a section in order to facilitate <b>collation,</b> the distinction is rarely made today.|$|E
25|$|It {{was added}} to the list of the New Testament manuscripts by F. H. A. Scrivener (559) and C. R. Gregory (546). Gregory saw it in 1883. It was {{examined}} by Dean Burgon, who described it in his The Revision Revised. Scrivener examined and collated its text. His <b>collation</b> was edited posthumously in 1893.|$|E
50|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was examined}} by Scholz, who collated it loosely. It was collated again by Tischendorf in 1843 and Tregelles in 1846. In 1850 Tischenforf and Tregelles compared their <b>collations</b> for mutual correction.|$|R

5000|$|A rule {{of thumb}} is that the two <b>collations</b> should not add up to the {{equivalent}} of another full meal. Rather portions were to be: [...] "sufficient to sustain strength, but not sufficient to satisfy hunger".|$|R
25|$|Ch is a digraph in the Latin script. It {{is treated}} as a letter of its own in Chamorro, Old Spanish, Czech, Slovak, Igbo, Uzbek, Quechua, Guarani, Welsh, Cornish, Breton and Belarusian Łacinka alphabets. In Vietnamese and Modern Spanish, it also used to be {{considered}} a letter for <b>collation</b> purposes but this is no longer common.|$|E
25|$|Digraphs are {{distinguished}} in <b>collation</b> (i.e. {{to determine}} the order of entries in a dictionary or directory) from the letters they consist of. For example, cukor is followed by csata, even though s precedes u, as cs is considered a single entity, and follows all the words starting with c. In general dictionaries, contracted forms of digraphs are collated {{as if they were}} written in full, e.g. Menyhért precedes mennybolt, even though n precedes y, because nny consists of nynbsp&+nbsp&ny, and h precedes ny. Short and long versions of vowels are considered equal for the purposes of <b>collation</b> (e.g. ír precedes Irak) unless the words are otherwise identically spelt, in which case the short vowel precedes the long one (e.g. egér precedes éger). Phrases and hyphenated compounds are collated ignoring the space or the hyphen between their elements; lower and upper case don't count either.|$|E
25|$|Lithuanian. In general usage, where letters {{appear with}} the caron (č, š and ž), they are {{considered}} as separate letters from c, s or z and collated separately; letters with the ogonek (ą, ę, į and ų), the macron (ū) and the superdot (ė) are considered as separate letters as well, but not given a unique <b>collation</b> order.|$|E
50|$|These early textual studies {{convinced}} {{him of the}} absolute necessity of new and more exact <b>collations</b> of manuscripts. From October 1840 until January 1843 he was in Paris, busy with the treasures of the Bibliothèque Nationale, eking out his scanty means by making <b>collations</b> for other scholars, and producing for the publisher, Firmin Didot, several editions of the Greek New Testament — one of them exhibiting {{the form of the}} text corresponding most closely to the Vulgate. His second edition retracted the more precarious readings of the first, and included a statement of critical principles that is a landmark for evolving critical studies of Biblical texts.|$|R

50|$|<b>Collations</b> {{of these}} {{manuscript}}s can be daunting, because a plenary manuscript in Arabic or Ethiopic/ Ge'ez is typically about 400 pages long, {{and in a}} translation into any modern European language, such a manuscript will come to about 800 pages.|$|R
