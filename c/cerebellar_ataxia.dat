25|$|Machado–Joseph disease (MJD) is a triplet repeat disease {{characterized}} by <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ataxia,</b> pyramidal signs, ophthalmoplegia, and polyneuropathy. Since muscle cramps are a frequent occurrence in MJD, axonal hyperexcitability {{has been considered}} {{to play a role}} in the disease. Research has demonstrated that the strength-duration time constant in MJD patients is significantly longer than in controls, and this corresponds to a significant reduction in rheobase. Combined with findings on Na+ channel blockers, these data suggest that the cramps in MJD are likely caused by the increased persistent Na+ channel conductance that may be unregulated during axonal reinnervation (which results from long-term axonal degeneration).|$|E

25|$|Ataxia-telangiectasia like {{disorder}} (ATLD) is {{an extremely}} rare condition, caused by mutation in the hMre11 gene, {{that could be considered}} in the differential diagnosis of A-T.

Those rare individuals with ATLD who are well described differ from those with A-T by the absence of telangiectasia, normal immunoglobulin levels, a later onset, and a slower progression of the symptoms. Because of its rarity, it is not yet known whether or not ATLD carries an increased risk to develop cancer. Because those mutations of Mre11 that severely impair the MRE11 protein are incompatible with life, individuals with ATLD all have some partial function of the Mre11 protein, and hence likely all have their own levels of disease severity.|$|E

25|$|Type 2 episodic ataxia (EA2) is {{characterized}} by acetazolamide-responsive attacks of ataxia with or without migraine. Patients with EA2 may also present with progressive cerebellar atrophy, nystagmus, vertigo, visual disturbances and dysarthria. These symptoms last from hours to days, in contrast with EA1, which lasts from seconds to minutes. Like EA1, attacks can be precipitated by emotional or physical stress, but also by coffee and alcohol. EA2 is caused by mutations in CACNA1A, which encodes the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel CaV2.1, and is also the gene responsible for causing spinocerebellar ataxia type-6 and familial hemiplegic migraine type-1. EA2 is {{also referred to as}} episodic ataxia with nystagmus, hereditary paroxysmal cerebellopathy, familial paroxysmal ataxia and acetazolamide-responsive hereditary paroxysmal <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ataxia</b> (AHPCA). There are currently 19 mutations associated with EA2, though only 3 have been characterized electrophysiologically, table 2 and figure 2. Of these, all result in decreased current through these channels. It is assumed that the other mutations, especially the splicing and frameshift mutations, also result in a drastic decrease in CaV2.1 currents, though {{this may not be the}} case for all mutations. CACNA1A is heavily expressed in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum where it is involved in coupling action potentials with neurotransmitter release. Thus, decrease in Ca2+ entry through CaV2.1 channels is expected to result in decreased output from Purkinje cells, even though they will fire at an appropriate rate. Alternatively, some CACNA1A mutations, such as those seen in familial hemiplegic migraine type-1, result in increased Ca2+ entry and, thereby, aberrant transmitter release. This can also result in excitotoxicity, as may occur in some cases of spinocerebellar ataxia type-6.|$|E

40|$|The {{terminology}} of <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ataxias</b> {{encompasses a}} variety of sporadic and inherited debilitating diseases. Patients exhibit disabling deficits such as dysmetria, kinetic tremor and ataxia of stance/gait. We are currently lacking effective treatments in degenerative <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ataxias.</b> Animal models of cerebellar disorders and studies in ataxic patients have demonstrated that the excitability of the sensorimotor cortex is severely depressed in case of cerebellar lesion. These reduced levels of excitability are associated with learning deficits. Recent experimental data show that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the premotor cortex and low-frequency repetitive stimulation of the motor cortex (LFRSM 1) restore the excitability of the motor cortex in hemicerebellectomized rats, reinstating {{the ability of the}} motor cortex to adapt to sustained peripheral stimulation. The hypothesis is based on the possibility that the combination of tDCS and contralateral LFRSM 1 can improve human <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ataxias.</b> The proposed treatment consists of delivering trains of tDCS either in conjunction or in alternance with contralateral LFRSM 1, in addition to application of peripheral nerve stimulation to sensitize the sensorimotor cortex. This hypothesis is to be tested in a procedure made of 3 steps in patients exhibiting a sporadic or inherited cerebellar disorder. First, patients are assessed clinically using validated scales of <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ataxias</b> and performing accepted quantified tests. Second, trains of tDCS and LFRSM 1 are delivered, using a sham procedure in a cross-over design. Trains of peripheral stimulation are applied at peripheral nerves. Third, patients are re-assessed clinically and with quantified tests. Although grafting of stem cells and gene therapy are being developed, they will not be available soon. A successful treatment of combined neurostimulation would lead to a new and readily available approach in the management of <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ataxias.</b> This new therapy is safe, feasible and may bring symptomatic improvement.

40|$|<b>Cerebellar</b> <b>ataxias</b> {{represent}} {{a spectrum of}} disorders which are, however, linked by common symptoms of motor incoordination and are typically associated with deficient in Purkinje cell firing activity and, often, degeneration. <b>Cerebellar</b> <b>ataxias</b> currently lack a curative agent. The endocannabinoid (eCB) system includes eCB compounds and their associated metabolic enzymes, together with cannabinoid receptors, predominantly the cannabinoid CB 1 receptor (CB 1 R) in the cerebellum; activation of this system in the cerebellar cortex is associated with deficits in motor coordination characteristic of ataxia, effects which can be prevented by CB 1 R antagonists. Of further interest are various findings that CB 1 R deficits may also induce a progressive ataxic phenotype. Together these studies suggest that motor coordination is reliant on maintaining the correct balance in eCB system signalling. Recent work also demonstrates deficient cannabinoid signalling in the mouse ‘ducky 2 J’ model of ataxia. In light of these points, the potential mechanisms whereby cannabinoids may modulate the eCB system to ameliorate dysfunction associated with <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ataxias</b> are considered...|$|R
