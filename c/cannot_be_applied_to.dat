5|$|In certain regions, {{presence}} or absence of certain scales may be a quick way to distinguish non-venomous and venomous snakes, but used with care and knowledge of exceptions. For example, in Myanmar, the {{presence or}} absence of loreal scales can be used to distinguish between relatively harmless Colubrids and lethally venomous Elapids. The rule of hand for this region is that the absence of a loreal scale between the nasal scale and pre-ocular scale indicates that the snake is an Elapid and hence lethal. This rule-of-thumb cannot be used without care as it <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> vipers, which have a large number of small scales on the head. A careful check would also be needed to exclude known poisonous members of the Colubrid family such as Rhabdophis.|$|E

Dnyaneshwar believes that reality is self–evident and does not require any proof.

25|$|Some {{proponents of}} Philosophy of Life, Vitalism, Critical realism (in German {{speaking}} countries) {{argued that there}} is a fundamental difference between physical, biological and psychological phenomena.

However, those claims were rejected by Paul Langevin, André Metz and others.

25|$|A {{number of}} authors have studied {{techniques}} for cycle detection that use more memory than Floyd's and Brent's methods, but detect cycles more quickly. In general these methods store several previously-computed sequence values, and test whether each new value equals {{one of the}} previously-computed values. In order to do so quickly, they typically use a hash table or similar data structure for storing the previously-computed values, and therefore are not pointer algorithms: in particular, they usually <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> Pollard's rho algorithm. Where these methods differ is in how they determine which values to store. Following Nivasch, we survey these techniques briefly.|$|E

500|$|Both photons and {{electrons}} create analogous interference patterns when {{passed through}} a double-slit experiment. For photons, this corresponds to the interference of a Maxwell light wave whereas, for material particles (electron), this corresponds to the interference of the Schrödinger wave equation. Although this similarity might suggest that Maxwell's equations describing the photon's electromagnetic wave are simply Schrödinger's equation for photons, most physicists do not agree. For one thing, they are mathematically different; most obviously, Schrödinger's one equation for the electron solves for a complex field, whereas Maxwell's four equations solve for real fields. More generally, the normal concept of a Schrödinger probability wave function <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> photons. As photons are massless, they cannot be localized without being destroyed; technically, photons cannot have a position eigenstate , and, thus, the normal Heisenberg uncertainty principle [...] does not pertain to photons. A few substitute wave functions have been suggested for the photon, {{but they have not}} come into general use. Instead, physicists generally accept the second-quantized theory of photons described below, quantum electrodynamics, in which photons are quantized excitations of electromagnetic modes.|$|E

500|$|There are {{multiple}} ways {{to define the}} concept of [...] "species." [...] The choice of definition {{is dependent on the}} particularities of the species concerned. For example, some species concepts apply more readily toward sexually reproducing organisms while others lend themselves better toward asexual organisms. Despite the diversity of various species concepts, these various concepts can be placed into one of three broad philosophical approaches: interbreeding, ecological and phylogenetic. The Biological Species Concept (BSC) {{is a classic example of}} the interbreeding approach. Defined by Ernst Mayr in 1942, the BSC states that [...] "species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups." [...] Despite its wide and long-term use, the BSC like others is not without controversy, for example because these concepts <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> prokaryotes, and this is called the species problem. Some researchers have attempted a unifying monistic definition of species, while others adopt a pluralistic approach and suggest that there may be different ways to logically interpret the definition of a species.|$|E
