40|$|Discussions on {{concepts}} of Single Axis Tracker (SAT) {{are becoming more}} and more apt for developing countries like India not just as an advancement in racking technology but due to the utmost necessity of reaching at the lowest Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) targets. With this increasing competition and significant fall in feed-in tariffs of solar PV projects, developers are under constant pressure to secure investment for their projects and eventually earn profits from them. Moreover, being the second largest populated country, India suffers from scarcity of land because of higher average population density. So, to mitigate the risk of this dual edged sword with reducing trend of unit (kWh) cost at one side and utilization of land on the other, tracking evolved as the call of the hour. Therefore, the prime objectives of this paper are not only to showcase how STT proves to be an effective mechanism to get more gain in Global Incidence in <b>collector</b> <b>plane</b> (Ginc) with respect to traditional mounting systems but also to introduce Seasonally Tilted Tracker (STT) technology as a possible option for high latitude locations...|$|E

40|$|Electrochemical {{impedance}} spectroscopy {{is potentially}} a powerful diagnostic {{tool for the}} investigation of the effects of aging in porous electrodes. A physically based three-electrode model was developed for a LixNi 0. 8 Coo-i 5 Alo-o 502 composite porous electrode with three porous separators and a reference electrode between a current <b>collector</b> and a <b>plane</b> electrode. Two effects of aging were modeled for this particular electrode chemistry, namely, a resistive corrosion layer on the current collector and a contact resistance between the electronic conductor and the active material of the porous electrode. The derivation of an analytical solution for the impedances between each pair of electrodes in this model yielded a computationally fast, versatile, and modular formulation. The solution was used to study the impact of selected components of the physical model on the impedance spectrum of the porous electrode for a physically relevant base case. Approximating the active material particles as spherical or flake-shaped particles, lognormally or Dirac distributed in size, revealed that the distribution has a negligible impact while the shape makes a noticeable difference. The main aging-related parameters were shown to have quite distinct effects on the impedance spectrum, which is essential for the regression of experimental data and the study of aging hypotheses...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The {{incoming}} radiation or more {{exactly the}} radiation being absorbed by a collector, {{is one of}} the most influential factors on the solar yield of a solar thermal system. Hence, a powerful monitoring especially of large solar thermal systems would not work without measuring the radiation with (at least) one (usually additional) sensor. Uncertainties due to the radiation occur, when the absorbed radiation has to be estimated. They depend on the accuracy of the used solar sensor, the plane, in which the sensor has been installed, the diffuse correlation and conversion models used for the estimation of the radiation-distribution over the sky and the incidence angle corrections for the used collector. Experimental comparisons yield, that properly calibrated PV-cells achieve acceptable accuracy for monitoring solar systems. The installation of the used sensor in <b>collector</b> <b>plane</b> instead of in horizontal plane should be preferred since it allows to determine the absorbed radiation with a lower uncertainty due to the estimation of the different fractions of the global radiation. For the estimation of the different fractions of the global radiation, the combination of the diffuse correlation method from Erbs together with the conversion model from Hay-Davies represents the measured data in a best way. More detailed methods do not provide better results in the scope of the investigated data. Additionally it could be shown that the consideration of the incidence angle correction has to be done with care, since typically used approximations could lead to not negligible deviations. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{assessment}} {{of the potential for}} dew water to serve as a potable water source during a rainless season in a humid tropical climate was carried out in the Pacific islands of French Polynesia. The climate of these islands, in terms of diurnal and seasonal variations, wind and energy balance, is representative of the climate of the tropical Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Measurements were obtained at two characteristic sites of this region; a mountainous island (Punaauia, Tahiti Island) and an atoll (Tikehau, Tuamotu Archipelago). Dew was measured daily on a 30 ° tilted, 1 m 2 <b>plane</b> <b>collector</b> equipped with a thermally insulated radiative foil. In addition, an electronic balance placed at 1 m above the ground with a horizontal 0. 16 m 2 condensing plate made of PolyTetraFluoroEthylene (Teflon) was used in Tahiti. Dew volume data, taken during the dry season from 16 / 5 / 2005 to 14 / 10 / 2005, were correlated with air temperature and relative humidity, wind speed, cloud cover and visible plus infrared radiometer measurements. The data were also fitted to a model. Dew formation in such a tropical climate is characterized by high absolute humidity, weak nocturnal temperature drop and strong Trade winds. These winds prevent dew from forming unless protected e. g. by natural vegetal windbreaks. In protected areas, dew can then form with winds as large as 7 m/s. Such strong winds also hamper at night the formation near the ground of a calm and cold air layer with high relative humidity. As the cooling power is lower than in the Mediterranean islands because of the high absolute humidity of the atmosphere, both effects combine to generate modest dew yields. However, dew events are frequent and provide accumulated amounts of water attractive for dew water harvesting. Slight modifications of existing rain collection devices on roofs can enhance dew formation and collection. Dew harvesting thus appears as an attractive possibility to provide the local population with a complementary - but on occasion, essential - water resourc...|$|R
40|$|Due to high {{installation}} costs and relatively low output, the active use of solar energy is limited. The output from a collector {{can be improved}} e. g. by using a selective absorber, AR-treated cover glass or transparent insulation. The output/cost ratio can also be improved {{by the use of}} reflectors. The performance of a collector depends highly on the incidence angle dependent optical efficiency. In this report, detailed methods for measuring the optical efficiency is developed. In order to evaluate the performance of a collector, measurements are needed. For the evaluations in this work, a dynamic test method has been used. The collector output is modelled as: = h 0 bKta(Q) Ib + h 0 dId – kDT - (mC) e(dTf/dtð) where h 0 is the optical efficiency, I the irradiance, k the heat loss factor, DT the temperature difference between collector and ambient air, and (mC) e the effective collector thermal capacitance. Kta(Q) is a modifier accounting for the dependence of varying incidence angles during the day. It is often modelled as: Kta(Q) = 1 - b 0 (1 /cos(Q) - 1) where b 0 is the “incidence angle modifier coefficient”. In order to evaluate the energy output from different collector types, measurements were made on a number of collector prototypes. In the analysis, the collector parameters were identified by MLR on the measured data. In order to verify the determined parameters, the modelled output was compared with the measured output. The annual energy output was then estimated by using the collector parameters in the simulation program MINSUN. In one study in the work, the incidence angle dependence of the absorptance was investigated by outdoor testing. The tested absorbers had coatings of nickel-pigmented aluminum oxide (Ni-Al 2 O 3), and sputtered nickel/nickel oxide (Ni-NiOx). The results showed that the Ni-Al 2 O 3 absorber has a slightly better performance than the Ni-NiOx absorber at high incidence angles. In another study, detailed comparative tests were made on different glazings in order to study the influence of AR treatment on the collector output. The tests indicated that the AR treatment can increase the annual output by 9 % (at Top = 50 °C). Usually a structured glass is installed with the structures facing the absorber. The evaluation indicates, however, that facing the structure outwards can increase the annual performance by 4 %. A detailed study showed that the b 0 factor generally depends on the incidence angle. MaReCo collectors are studied in the work. This is a reflector collector, specially designed for northern latitudes. The MaReCo principally consists of an asymmetric reflector trough with a single, double-sided selective, absorber that runs along the trough. The purpose of the MaReCo is to replace the collector box, insulation, and some of the absorber material by a reflector. The standard MaReCo has an acceptance angle interval of 20 ° - 65 °, outside which the reflector is not active and the absorber only works with radiation direct from the sun. The MaReCo concept is flexible and can be used for stand-alone as well as building integrated applications. Several MaReCo prototypes have been tested in the work. The estimated yearly energy output at 50 °C from a stand-alone MaReCo with Teflon and from a Roof-MaReCo, both at a tilt of 30 °, were 282 and 336 kWh/m² respectively. The Spring/Fall-MaReCo is a special version that has a low optical efficiency during the summer. In this way, a larger collector area can be installed for increasing the solar fraction of the system without increasing the risk of overheating. The test results estimate a yearly energy output of 222 kWh/m² from this collector. For an asymmetric collector (e. g. the MaReCo), the incidence angle dependence will be different in different directions. The angular analysis then has to be made in two perpendicular planes (longitudinal and transverse) of the collector. In the transverse plane, not only the properties of glass and absorber affect the output, but also the reflectivity and shape of the reflector. In order to handle this, a biaxial incidence angle modifier should be used. One example is the common “product model”: Kta(Q) = KL(QL, 0) KT(0,QT). Shortcomings of this model are that it is not correct for <b>plane</b> <b>collectors</b> and that it is not defined for concentrators where normal incidence is outside the acceptance interval. In this work, a new expression for a biaxial incidence angle modifier is suggested: Kta = fL(Q) gTL(QT). The factor fL(Q) gives information about the influence of the glazing and gTL(QT) accounts for the influence of the reflector. This expression differs in principle from the product model, since QL is not used. In order to study the suggested model, measurements were made on MaReCo collectors. The “no-loss efficiency” was determined by eliminating the effect of heat losses from the measured output. The factor fL(Q) was decided from measurements in the L direction made around the equinox (when QT is constant). The factor FT(QT) was determined from measurements in the T direction for constant QL. In order to keep QL constant, the collector was rotated to a north/south direction. The results were then used to calculate the reflector factor, gTL(QT), as the ratio FT(QT) /fL(QT). The parameters were then used to model the energy output. The analyses indicate that the new suggested biaxial expression can be used to model the collector output for asymmetric collectors where the standard model does not work. One drawback of the method is, however, that it requires measurements to be made around either spring or autumn equinox. The new suggested model has also been tested for modelling the angular performance of PV modules with concentrators...|$|R
40|$|In {{a typical}} {{electron-beam}} {{physical vapor deposition}} system, there is limited control over how the high-power electron beam heats the metal surface. This leads to thermal nonuniformities at the melt. Three-dimensional direct simulation Monte Carlo simulations were performed {{with the aim of}} quantifying the effect of such spatial variations of source temperature in thin film depositions using an electron-beam physical vapor deposition system. The source temperature distribution from a typical deposition process was used in the direct simulation Monte Carlo simulations performed for various mass flow rates. The use of an area-averaged temperature is insufficient for all mass flow rates due to the highly nonlinear relationship between temperature and saturation number density, and hence, the mass flux. The mass flow rate equivalent temperature was determined, and the simulations performed with this temperature were compared with those corresponding to the actual nonuniform temperature distribution. For low mass flow rates, the growth rates depend very weakly on the spatial variation of temperature as long as an equivalent temperature corresponding to the same mass flow rate was used. However, as the mass flow rate increases, the error associated with this approximation increases. For deposition processes with source Knudsen numbers less than 0. 05, {{it is not possible to}} account for the spatial nonuniformities in temperature using the total mass flow rate without significant errors. For a given mass flow rate, the errors associated with using an equivalent temperature decrease with increasing <b>collector</b> <b>plane</b> distance since the flow is allowed to expand further, thereby decreasing the effects of slit temperature nonuniformities...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 3 rd Southern African Solar Energy Conference, South Africa, 11 - 13 May, 2015. Because of the soaring energy prices, many countries have shown an increased interest in the utilization of solar energy. The optimization of the solar energy collector design plays {{a critical role in}} the efficient collection of solar energy. Flat-plate collectors can be designed in applications that require energy delivery at moderate temperatures (up to 100 ◦C above ambient temperature). These collectors use both beam and diffuse solar radiation, and do not need to track the sun. They are simple to manufacture and install with relatively low maintenance cost which make this kind of solar collectors more popular. The design of a flat-plate solar collector embraces many relationships among the collector parameters, field parameters and solar radiation data at any given location. The shading decreases the incident energy on <b>collector</b> <b>plane</b> of the field. The multi-objective optimum design of stationary flat-plate solar collectors is presented in this work. The clear day solar beam radiation and diffuse radiation at the location of the solar collector (Miami) are estimated. The maximization of the annual average incident solar energy, maximization of the lowest month incident solar energy and minimization of the cost are considered as objectives [...] The game theory methodology is used for the solution of the three objective problems to find the best compromise solution. The sensitivity analysis with respect to the design variables and the solar constant are conducted to find the relative influence of the parameters on the design. The multi-objective optimum design of stationary flat-plate solar collectors under probabilistic uncertainty is also considered. The three objectives stated earlier are considered in the optimization problem. The solar constant, altitude, typical day of each month and most of the design variables have been treated as probabilistic variables following normal distribution. The game theory methodology is used for the solution of the three objective constrained optimization problems to find a balanced solution. A parametric study is conducted with respect to changes in the standard deviation of the mean values of design variables and probability of constraint satisfaction. This work represents a novel application of the multi-objective optimization strategy, including probabilistic approach, for the solution of the solar collector design problem. The present study is expected to help designers in creating optimized solar collectors based on any specified requirements. cf 201...|$|E
