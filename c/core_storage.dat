40|$|We {{are keeping}} Dome Fuji ice core samples at two storage {{temperatures}} (- 50 and - 20 ℃) after deep ice core drilling reached 2503 m at the Dome Fuji station, Antarctica. Since we {{aimed to develop}} new methods for studying physical properties of ice <b>cores,</b> cold <b>storage</b> down to - 50 ℃ was necessary to avoid volume relaxation of ice <b>cores</b> during <b>storage.</b> To compare the volume relaxation process of an ice <b>core</b> under different <b>storage</b> temperatures, we captured images using a digital camera. Many tiny bubbles and plate-like inclusions (cleavage cracks) were observed in the ice core kept at the high storage temperature (- 20 ℃). The clear ice seen just after ice core recovery changes to milky coloured cloudy ice because of the many tiny bubbles and cleavage cracks generated. We analyzed the volume relaxation rate of each ice core sample based on the digital images; {{it was clear that}} the generation of tiny bubbles and cleavage cracks and the decomposition of air hydrate crystals were avoided effectively at a storage temperature of - 50 ℃. In cold storage down to - 50 ℃, various physical properties of the ice core have been successfully investigated. In the present paper, we emphasize the importance of low-temperature storage to maintain high-quality ice cores. I. Microphysical properties, deformation, texture and grain growt...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Carbon Storage Program {{contains}} three principal components: Core Research and Development (R&D), Infrastructure, and Program Support (Strategic). Core R&D involves both applied laboratory- and pilot-scale research {{focused on}} adapting existing and developing {{new technologies and}} systems for geologic <b>storage.</b> <b>Core</b> R&D encompasses three Technology Areas: (1) Geologic Storage Technologies and Simulation and Risk Assessment (GSRA); (2) Monitoring, Verification, Accounting (MVA), and Assessment; and (3) Carbon Use and Reuse.

The MVA Technology Area is subdivided into four Key Technologies (atmospheric monitoring; near-surface monitoring; subsurface monitoring; and intelligent monitoring).

30|$|The C-RAN {{is a novel}} {{mobile network}} architecture, which has a {{potential}} to optimize cost and energy consumption {{in the field of}} mobile networks. In C-RAN systems, there are multiple cloud providers (CPs), which can generate more revenue from the sharing of available resources. CPs have their system resources, such as a CPU <b>core,</b> memory, <b>storage,</b> and network bandwidth. To ensure the optimal usage of cloud resources, baseband processing is centralized in a virtualized baseband units pool (VBP). The VBP can be shared by different CPs and multiple BSs. Therefore, the VBP is in a unique position as a cloud brokering between the BSs and the CPs for cloud services while increasing resource efficiency and system throughput [11].|$|R
