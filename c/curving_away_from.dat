5|$|Hurricane Lili was a {{moderate}} tropical cyclone of the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season. It {{began as a}} subtropical cyclone over the central Atlantic and became a hurricane while moving westward toward the United States. Lili did not gain any additional strength before <b>curving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> land and weakening into a tropical storm. After transitioning into an extratropical cyclone, it made landfall in southeastern Newfoundland. Overall, the hurricane's effects on land were minimal, despite multiple tropical cyclone watches and warnings. Initial uncertainty in its track prompted some concern of a landfall in North Carolina, but it remained predominately over the open ocean.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before {{crossing}} {{into the}} Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, the storm {{reached its peak}} intensity with winds of 90mph (150km/h) and a central pressure of 977mbar (hPa; 28.85inHg). After crossing 140°W, Dalilia weakened to a minimal hurricane. The storm maintained this intensity until July19, at which time the system slowed and turned northwest. The following day, the weakening tropical storm brushed the Hawaiian Islands to the south, eventually <b>curving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the island chain on July21. Later that day, Dalilia further weakened to a tropical depression, with the Central Pacific Hurricane Center issuing their final advisory at that time. The remnants of the former hurricane continued to track northwest. On July24, the system interacted with the remnants of Tropical Storm Erick and may have briefly re-attained tropical storm intensity; however, by July28, the storm was rapidly tracking north through the Aleutian Islands. The remnants of Dalilia dissipated shortly thereafter.|$|E
500|$|North of Bolton Landing, {{the route}} leaves the main lake and instead follows {{the edge of}} Northwest Bay, an inlet {{separated}} from Lake George itself by a large, mountainous peninsula. The bay abruptly ends about [...] to the north, at which point NY9N curves {{to the east and}} proceeds through a pass in the mountains to rejoin the western edge of Lake George at Sabbath Day Point in the town of Hague. Here, the route turns back to the north and follows Lake George to the hamlet of Hague, where it meets the northern (signed as the eastern) terminus of NY8. NY9N continues to serve as the lakeside roadway for another [...] before <b>curving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the lake and entering Essex County.|$|E

2500|$|If {{the cannon}} fires its ball {{with a low}} initial speed, the {{trajectory}} of the ball curves downward and hits the ground (A). As the firing speed is increased, the cannonball hits the ground farther (B) away from the cannon, because while the ball is still falling towards the ground, the ground is increasingly <b>curving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> it (see first point, above). All these motions are actually [...] "orbits" [...] in a technical sense – they are describing a portion of an elliptical path around {{the center of gravity}} – but the orbits are interrupted by striking the Earth.|$|E
60|$|Ken was {{off with}} all the speed left in him. He {{strained}} every nerve and was going fast when he passed the foul-flag. The bleachers loomed up indistinct in his sight. But he thought only of meeting the ball. The hit was a savage liner, <b>curving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> him. Cinders under his flying feet were a warning {{that he did not}} heed. He was on the track. He leaped into the air, left hand outstretched, and felt the ball strike in his glove.|$|E
5000|$|Recurve bow: a bow {{with the}} tips <b>curving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the archer. The curves {{straighten}} {{out as the}} bow is drawn {{and the return of}} the tip to its curved state after release of the arrow adds extra velocity to the arrow.|$|E

50|$|Just {{after the}} crossing, the Wilkinson veers {{off to the}} northeast. It remains {{generally}} level, <b>curving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the brook over its next 0.3 mile then southeast back toward it. At the brook, it intersects another trail—the white-blazed Breakneck Ridge Trail. The two briefly merge, following a northeast heading. Just before re-entering the state park, they diverge again.|$|E
50|$|Despite having {{platforms}} serving different lines (and, officially {{different companies}} at first), Scotswood {{was regarded as}} a single station. The northern pair of platforms on the Newburn line was added to the southern pair on the Newcastle-Blaydon line in 1875. <b>Curving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the original platforms, they were at a higher level, and ended some 50yds to the east.|$|E
50|$|A recurve {{crossbow}} is a bow {{that has}} tips <b>curving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the archer. The recurve bow's bent limbs {{have a longer}} draw length than an equivalent straight-limbed bow, giving more acceleration to the projectile and less hand shock. Recurved limbs also put greater strain on the materials {{used to make the}} bow, and they may make more noise with the shot.|$|E

40|$|We used five cultivars of Zea mays (Bear Hybrid WF 9 * 38 MS, B 73 * Missouri 17, Yellow Dent, Merit, and Great Lakes Hybrid 422) to reinvestigate the {{specificity}} of metal ions for inducing root curvature. Of 17 cations tested, 6 (Al 3 +, Ba 2 +, Ca 2 +, Cd 2 +, Cu 2 +, Zn 2 +) induced curvature. Roots <b>curved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Al 3 +, Ba 2 +, and Cd 2 +. Roots <b>curved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> low (0. 1 millimolar) concentrations of Cu 2 + but toward higher (1 - 5 millimolar) concentrations. Roots initially <b>curved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Zn 2 + but {{the direction of the}} subsequent curvature was unpredictable. In most cases, roots of all cultivars curved towards calcium. However, in some tests there was no response to calcium or even (especially in the cultivars Merit and B 73 * Missouri 17) substantial curvature <b>away</b> <b>from</b> calcium. The results indicate that the induction of root curvature is not specific for calcium. The results are discussed relative to the possible role of calmodulin as a mediator of ion-induced root curvature...|$|R
5000|$|The {{electrified}} Hempstead Branch branches {{from the}} Main Line east of Queens Village (does not <b>curve</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Main Line until Floral Park) and runs east to Hempstead.

50|$|Childhood is {{represented}} by the space between the fountain and the garden door - the door to maturity. As in life, one finds two paths, one is straight with no problems, no difficulties, serene under the guidance of parents - while the other is a serpentine path, full of adventure, danger, <b>curving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the parents’ sight. The parents are represented by statues of two lions.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the down}} side were two bay platforms, one running through a goods shed. These joined the running lines by a crossing, but also led back to longer sidings next to the down line. Next to the up line {{on the other side}} of the road bridge, was a short loop serving a cattle dock, and an unusual siding <b>curving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the running lines to some small sheds.|$|E
5000|$|The line {{opened to}} traffic on 27 July 1885, when the {{existing}} Ledbury station was renamed Ledbury Junction, the Ledbury and Gloucester line <b>curving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Worcester and Hereford Railway line on an embankment immediately {{west of the}} station.Just south of the junction the double-track line was carried at an awkward angle of approximately 45° over the Hereford Road, {{now part of the}} A438, by an arch bridge of [...] "unusual design".|$|E
50|$|The line <b>curves</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Broxbourne to {{the left}} and heads towards Hertford. For most of its length, it is bounded by the New River on its left and the River Lea and Lee Navigation on its right when looking at it from east to west.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, he's fine!" [...] exclaimed Ken. [...] "I'm {{not afraid}} any more. He digs my {{drop out of}} the dust, and I can't get a <b>curve</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> him. He's weak only on the jump ball, and I don't throw that often, only when I let drive." ...|$|R
50|$|Inside-out (i-o) throws (green paths) {{occur when}} the thrower {{releases}} the disc {{in such a way}} that it initially comes towards the throwing axis (inside-). However, the disc is tilted with the side closest to the body highest, which causes the disc to <b>curve</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the thrower (-out).|$|R

50|$|The {{case of a}} bentside spinet is {{approximately}} triangular. The side {{on the right is}} usually bent concavely (hence the name of the instrument), <b>curving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the player toward the right rear corner. The longest side is adjacent to and parallel with the bass strings, going from the right rear corner to a location on the player's left. The front side of the spinet contains the keyboard. Typically, there are very short sides at the right rear and on the left, connecting the bentside to the long side and the long side to the front.|$|E
50|$|When the Big Dig put the Artery {{underground}} in {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, the full section along the Artery, {{as well as the}} southern end, was converted to one-way northbound, with southbound traffic on the other side, known in sections as Surface Artery, Purchase Street and again Surface Artery. The new northbound tunnel was built under Atlantic Avenue south of Dewey Square. Only the part <b>curving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Artery to end at Commercial Street remained two-way. South of Kneeland Street, a ramp from the northbound Artery and its frontage road joins the intersection of Kneeland Street and Atlantic Avenue.|$|E
50|$|The South Eastern Motorway section, a radial route, was {{originally}} {{meant to be}} part of the M11. It <b>curves</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the city centre and instead joins the N11 at junction 17 heading south. The next opportunity to exit the motorway at the Bray North exit of the M11.|$|R
50|$|A difficult, yet highly {{effective}} variation to the serve {{is to add}} curve to the hit. This {{can be done by}} sweeping across the ball from left to right, or vice versa, when hitting with the inside surface of the fist. If done correctly, the ball should appear to <b>curve</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> or into the opposition, confusing their return.|$|R
50|$|Oregonia bifurca can {{be readily}} {{distinguished}} from O. gracilis in having shorter rostral horns that <b>curve</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> each other, triangular postorbital spines closer to the eyes and pointing more forward, a wider {{front end of the}} carapace, and long and slender dactyli on their walking legs. The tuberculation in O. bifurca is finer than in O. gracilis.|$|R

5000|$|Both tunnels survive, as {{does some}} of the {{trackbed}} albeit largely covered by vegetation. Three stations still exist, Lyminge as a public library and those at Bishopsbourne and Bridge as private residences. Between Canterbury West to South only a short section of embankment survives <b>curving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the junction at Harbledown. Little remains of the route between Barham and Lyminge. The section between Peene and Cheriton Junction has been built over by the Channel Tunnel terminal building. Canterbury South and Barham stations have been lost to housing developments. At Elham the station platform now forms the garden boundary wall of {{a house in a}} road called [...] "The Sidings".|$|E
50|$|North of Bolton Landing, {{the route}} leaves the main lake and instead follows {{the edge of}} Northwest Bay, an inlet {{separated}} from Lake George itself by a large, mountainous peninsula. The bay abruptly ends about 2 mi to the north, at which point NY 9N curves {{to the east and}} proceeds through a pass in the mountains to rejoin the western edge of Lake George at Sabbath Day Point in the town of Hague. Here, the route turns back to the north and follows Lake George to the hamlet of Hague, where it meets the northern (signed as the eastern) terminus of NY 8. NY 9N continues to serve as the lakeside roadway for another 3 mi before <b>curving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the lake and entering Essex County.|$|E
50|$|In its {{original}} sense, the Coandă effect {{refers to the}} tendency of a fluid jet to stay attached to an adjacent surface that <b>curves</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the flow, and the resultant entrainment of ambient air into the flow. The effect is named for Henri Coandă, the Romanian aerodynamicist who exploited it in many of his patents.|$|R
50|$|On the Padstow side of Wadebridge bridge a road {{occupies}} the space previously occupied {{by both the}} railway trackbed and an adjacent lane, but the lines which <b>curved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> this towards the quays along the river cannot now be discerned. Once the limit of development on the riverside is reached the old trackbed, {{in the form of}} the Camel Trail, becomes visible again.|$|R
5000|$|A $24 Million {{project to}} {{rehabilitate}} the Tyngsborough Bridge began in 2005. Repairs took around seven years, {{and the original}} bridge was re-opened {{on the morning of}} September 11, 2012. [...] In late 2011, through traffic just east of the bridge was rerouted to <b>curve</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Merrimack River before rejoining the original right of way. However, the original route remains open for local traffic.|$|R
