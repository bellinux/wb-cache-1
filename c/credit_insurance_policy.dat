On November 7 th, 2014, the U. S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal of the King v. Burwell case. The Supreme Court will thus consider the arguments refuted in this Essay. If the Supreme Court accepts these arguments, commentators expect that the result will dramatically undermine the functioning of Obamacare in many states, potentially generating far worse outcomes than the status quo prior to Obamacare...|$|R
50|$|After regaining {{consciousness}} on {{the beautiful}} and wealthy planet of New Kuwait, Tikkirey demands to cancel his contract and leave the ship. He immediately finds out that a clause in the contract prevents him from doing just that, as he must pay off his 150,000 <b>credit</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>policy,</b> which will require Tikkirey to serve another 1.5 years on the ship.

40|$|The present {{thesis is}} aimed to {{investigate}} the possibility to expand the hedging purpose of Credit Default Swaps (CDS), to hedge credit risk on trade credits of Small and Medium (industrial) Enterprises (SME). Recent years of severe economic crisis have led to some deep changings in the practices of credit management within industrial entities. Year after year such entities have stressed their attention on credit risk management. At {{the end of the}} chain of credit risk management we find Trade <b>credit</b> <b>insurance,</b> which is a fast growing sector, with raising interest by the industrial entities. Conceptually, Trade <b>credit</b> <b>insurance’s</b> purpose is not quite different than the purpose of a Credit Default Swap (i. e. hedging the buyer from the insolvency risk of an underlying entity), so it would be its most direct competitor. The main issue in extending the pricing of CDS to SME is represented by the fact that SME, in general terms, are neither listed nor rated and do not issue debt instruments. This entails the fact that, for such entities, risk neutral Probabilities of Default, needed by standard pricing models, cannot be retrieved from market traded instruments. To overcome such issue, we constructed an “equivalent risk neutral PD”. The approach was similar to the Radon-Nikodym theorem: we defined a corrective factor to be applied to the “real world PDs”, in order to obtain an equivalent risk neutral Probability of Default. Obviously, what obtained is a proxy. Real world PDs for SME were calculated starting by the databases put into our disposal by modeFinance Srl, which is a certified credit rating agency, specialized in the creditworthiness evaluation of Small and Medium Enterprises. On the other hand, CDS risk neutral default probabilities were bootstrapped from real CDS trades, by different maturities and rating classes. The data source was in this case Bloomberg. Being such hypothetical CDS a new instrument, there is no real benchmark to state whether the obtained spreads resulted into a fair cost, or not. So we first applied the developed pricing model to a set of 1, 000 Italian SME. The results obtained were quite positive, since the average SME-CDS spread obtained by rating class and maturity, other than being monotonically increasing with rating class worsening and maturity increasing, was also in average 42 % higher than the (average) spreads observed for real traded CDS, as common sense would suggest it had to be. As a final step we compared the obtained cost of these new instrument with the cost of 4 standard Trade <b>credit</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> (which were kindly disclosed, in anonymous form, by the insurance broker Willis Italia S. p. A.). Even if CDS and Trade <b>Credit</b> <b>Insurance</b> may have the same conceptual goal (to protect from default risk of an underlying entity), as instruments they are radically different and such cost comparison of the two is not quite straightforward. In order to make the comparison more plausible, we made two hypotheses on how to calculate the equivalent CDS cost of such trade <b>credit</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>policies.</b> For all the analyzed policies, the real policy cost was lying between the two CDS cost proxies. In general terms at the moment, it is hard to tell whether the CDS prices obtained with the model developed, could be defined “fair”. Certainly, the results of the benchmarking tell us that they are at least plausible.

50|$|In 1965, after {{a century}} of {{operation}} as a family business, Spiegel was purchased by Beneficial Finance Company. Spiegel stockholders received shares of Beneficial stock, and Spiegel became a wholly owned subsidiary. During the early 1970s, several charges were leveled against Spiegel by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regarding some of the company's marketing tactics. In 1971, the FTC accused Spiegel of failing to adequately disclose credit terms in some of its statements and catalog ads. The company also was cited for its handling of <b>credit</b> life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies,</b> {{as well as for}} offering free home trials without informing customers that credit approval was required before a product would be shipped. Moreover, in 1974, the FTC charged that Spiegel's debt collection policies treated customers unfairly. Most of the complaints brought by FTC during this period were settled by minor changes in company practices, and serious action by the government was generally avoided.|$|R

For the most {{part of the work}} the author deals with <b>credit</b> <b>insurance</b> market as it represents {{a key part of the}} system. Author analyses portfolio specifics of the local export <b>credit</b> <b>insurance</b> agency and searches for the most effective risk mitigation techniques and procedures in order to maintain its long-term non-loss operations while keeping in mind its special supportive mission. Particular attention is given to the export <b>credit</b> <b>insurance</b> agency's business <b>policy</b> that copes with problems of information asymmetry, moral hazard and adverse selection. Author points out the differences between state supported and commercial insurers, analyses European legislation preventing export credit agencies from competition with commercial insurers and outlines more effective endogenous and self-regulating system. Minority of the work deals with less important export credit financing agency that represents a dominant player at the export credit financing market. Author finds almost twenty reasons of its extraordinary position at the market that has no analogy within developed countries worldwide and outlines a system securing its complement role to the commercial banks. Finally the author provides the analysis of the whole state supported export credit system, highlights its main risks in conjunction with each other and concludes that combination of negative circumstances influencing several important features of the system could possibly lead to a long-term instability of the system...|$|R
