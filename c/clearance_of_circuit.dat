40|$|BACKGROUND: Controversy {{exists as}} to whether {{electric}} charges of plasma proteins influence their transport across the peritoneal membrane during CAPD. Fixed negative charges in the peritoneal membrane are diminished during peritonitis in rats. METHODS: Peritoneal <b>clearances</b> <b>of</b> 10 proteins and their isoforms were used to establish the relationship between peritoneal clearance and molecular weight. The observed protein clearances were compared with the predicted clearances based on molecular weight. <b>Clearances</b> <b>of</b> proteins with different charge but identical size were compared. Stable patients and peritonitis patients were compared. Results. Only the peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> lipase, LDH 4 / 5 and IgG 3 were {{significantly different from the}} predicted values (P <= 0. 05). The peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> slightly anionic beta 2 microglobulin (1072 microl/min) and cationic lysozyme (572 microl/min) showed no evidence for charge selectivity; neither did the peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> slightly anionic transferrin (86 microl/min) and highly anionic albumin (99 microl/min). The peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> IgG 1, IgG 2 and IgG 4 were identical (32, 31 and 31 microl/min), despite their different charge. The peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> cationic LDH 4 / 5 was 137 microl/min and higher than the peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> neutral LDH 3 (97 microl/min, P= 0. 01) and LDH 1 (59 microl/min, P= 0. 02). These results suggested charge selectivity; however in five additional patients during peritonitis the peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> LDH 4 / 5 increased to 10 times the peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> LDH 1. Local LDH isoenzyme release from the cells present in the dialysate was shown to be responsible in stable and peritonitis patients. Likewise, the higher peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> neutral pancreatic amylase (234 microl/min) compared to anionic salivary amylase (142 microl/min, P= 0. 03) could probably be attributed to local release of the former from the pancreas, as the peritoneal <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> lipase (highly anionic) was higher than predicted and the difference remained during peritonitis. CONCLUSIONS: The peritoneal membrane constitutes a size- but probably not a charge-selective barrier for the transport of macromolecules between blood and dialysate during stable CAP...|$|R

40|$|Previous studies {{demonstrated}} that plasma <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> organic anions such as bilirubin, bile acid, sulfobromophthalein (BSP) and indocyanine green (ICG), was reduced from 36 % (bile acid) to 55 % (ICG) in fasted (3 days) horses.

However, fasting may also affect hepatic blood flow, thereby contributing to reduced <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> these compounds. In order to test this hypothesis, plasma <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> antipyrine, acetaminophen and lidocaine, drugs known to be cleared by the liver yet not suspected of undergoing carrier-mediated hepatic uptake, were investigated in nine healthy adult mares (three horses/drug group) before and following a 3 -day fast. Results demonstrate that fasting decreased <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> organic anions from previous studies more than <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> drugs used in these studies. In addition, <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> lidocaine, the drug with the highest plasma clearance and therefore the drug {{most likely to be}} affected by reduced hepatic blood flow, was affected least by fasting. Therefore, reductions in <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> these compounds due to fasting must not be due entirely to reductions in hepatic blood flow, but must also involve reductions in intrinsic hepatic clearance.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Progress {{in therapy}} for cryptococcal {{meningitis}} {{has been slow}} {{because of the lack}} of a suitable marker of treatment response. Previously, we demonstrated the statistical power of a novel endpoint, the rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection, based on serial quantitative cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, to differentiate the fungicidal activity of alternative antifungal drug regimens. We hypothesized that the rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection should also be a clinically meaningful endpoint. METHODS: We combined data from cohorts of patients with human immunodeficiency virus-associated cryptococcal meningitis from Thailand, South Africa, and Uganda, for whom the rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection was determined, and clinical and laboratory data prospectively collected, and explored the association between the rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection and mortality by Cox survival analyses. RESULTS: The combined cohort comprised 262 subjects.

40|$|Summary. <b>Clearance</b> <b>of</b> various {{bacteria}} {{isolated from}} portal and systemic blood of mice was evaluated and compared. All portal blood strains, including Escherichia coli and enterococci were eliminated more rapidly from the circulation than were strains isolated from systemic blood, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With mannose-type lectin, mannose or fucose residues that mediated lectinophagocytosis were detected on {{the surfaces of}} most portal strains by agglutination tests. Blood <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> Esch. coli H 21 was inhibited by prior injection of mannose into mice, suggesting that the <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> this strain was mediated by mannose-type lectin {{on the surface of}} tissue macrophages. However, no inhibition <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> any other strains was observed by the injection of mannose, galactose, or fucose into mice, nor by pre-incubation of bacteria with mannose. Blood <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> some portal strains was significantly faster in CBA/J mice than in CBA/N mice with B cell immune deficiency, indicating that immunoglobulin was involved in their clearance. Among portal strains only enterococci showed high cell-surface hydrophobicity.

40|$|Chromatin is an {{important}} autoantigen in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) as an immunogen and {{as a part of}} nephritogenic immune complexes. Earlier studies focused on <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> DNA. However, DNA released into the circulation from dying cells is found associated with histones in nucleosomes. The liver is the major organ involved in <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> chromatin from the circulation of mice. Heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPG) have been implicated in the <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> various charged molecules. Receptor-mediated <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> ssDNA by the liver has also been reported. Because chromatin contains positively charged histones in addition to DNA, we wished to determine if HSPG and/or DNA receptors are involved in chromatin <b>clearance.</b> The rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> H 1 -stripped chromatin from the bloodstream of C 57 Bl/ 10 mice was markedly decreased by prior treatment of mice with Heparinase I.

40|$|The <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> protein-bound solutes by {{hemofiltration}} and hemodiafiltration. BackgroundHemofiltration in {{the form}} of continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) is increasingly used to treat acute renal failure. Compared to hemodialysis, hemofiltration provides high clearances for large solutes but its effect on protein-bound solutes has been largely ignored. MethodsStandard clinical systems were used to remove test solutes from a reservoir containing artificial plasma. <b>Clearances</b> <b>of</b> the protein-bound solutes phenol red (CPR) and indican (CIN) were compared to <b>clearances</b> <b>of</b> urea (CUREA) during hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration. A mathematical model was developed to predict clearances from values for plasma flowQp, dialysate flowQd, ultrafiltration rateQf, filter size and the extent of solute binding to albumin. ResultsWhen hemofiltration was performed withQp 150 mL /min andQf 17 mL /min, clearance values were CPR 1. 0 ± 0. 1 mL /min; CIN 3. 7 ± 0. 5 mL /min; and CUREA 14 ± 1 mL /min. The <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> the protein-bound solutes was approximately equal to the solute-free fraction multiplied by the ultrafiltration rate corrected for the effect of predilution. Addition ofQd 42 mL /min to provide HDF whileQp remained 150 mL /min resulted in proportional increases in the <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> protein-bound solutes and urea. In contrast, the <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> protein-bound solutes relative to urea increased when hemodiafiltration was performed using a larger filter and increasingQd to 300 mL /min whileQp was lowered to 50 mL /min. The pattern of observed results was accurately predicted by mathematical modeling. ConclusionIn vitro measurements and mathematical modeling indicate that CVVH provides very limited <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> protein-bound solutes. Continuous venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) increases the <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> protein-bound solutes relative to urea only when dialysate flow rate and filter size are increased above values now commonly employed...|$|R
