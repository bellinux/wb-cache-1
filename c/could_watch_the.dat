5|$|What {{was needed}} was a new bombsight, one that could be very quickly set up, had useful {{illumination}} of the crosshairs for night use and was stabilized so the bomb aimer <b>could</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> approach as the bomber was manoeuvring. An early attempt was the Mk. XI, which mounted a cut-down CSBS {{on the front of}} a gyro unit taken from a Sperry Gyroscope artificial horizon, to provide stabilization in the horizontal plane, useful for aiding drift measurements and corrections. It was no easy task to manually calculate the range angle on the Course and Speed Calculator. Although introduced in 1941, only a small number were produced.|$|E
5|$|Catherine's {{earliest}} {{building project}} was the château of Montceaux-en-Brie, near Paris, which Henry II gave her in 1556, {{three years before}} his death. The building consisted of a central pavilion housing a straight staircase, and two wings with a pavilion at each end. Catherine wanted to cover the alley in the garden where Henry played pall mall, an early form of croquet. For this commission, Philibert de l'Orme built her a grotto. He set it on a base {{made to look like}} natural rock, from which guests <b>could</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> games while taking refreshments. The work was completed in 1558 but has not survived. The château ceased {{to be used as a}} royal residence after 1640, and had fallen into ruin by the time it was demolished by revolutionary decree in 1798.|$|E
5|$|Led by Wing Commander Lou Spence, No.77 Squadron was {{committed}} to action over Korea as part of United Nations Command, and came under the operational control of the US Fifth Air Force. The Australian unit was specifically requested by General Douglas MacArthur, commander of UN forces; the Mustang was considered the best long-range ground-attack aircraft in the theatre, and Stratemeyer contended that No.77 Squadron was the best Mustang outfit in Japan. The squadron flew its initial escort and patrol sorties from Iwakuni on 2July 1950, becoming the first non-American UN unit to commence operations. Several Australian families were still living at Iwakuni pending their repatriation from what had become an operational theatre, and <b>could</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> Mustangs depart for missions over Korea.|$|E

5|$|With both of {{the leading}} {{candidates}} now discounted, Princess Victoria suggested Prince Louis of Hesse, a minor German royal, the nephew of the Grand Duke of Hesse. Princess Victoria {{had gone to the}} court of Hesse to inspect Louis's sister, Princess Anna, as a potential bride for her brother, the Prince of Wales. Although not favorably impressed with Princess Anna, she was impressed with Louis and his brother Prince Henry. Both were invited to Windsor Castle in 1860, ostensibly so they <b>could</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> Ascot Races in the company of the royal family, but in reality, the visit was a chance for the Queen to inspect her potential son-in-law. The Queen admired both Louis and Henry, but noted how well Louis and Alice got along together. When the Hessian family departed, Louis requested Alice's photograph, and Alice made it clear that she was attracted to him.|$|E
5|$|One more legend narrated {{is about}} the goddess painted on a thangka in the monastery which is of Palden Lhamo. This female deity is {{compared}} to the Hindu Goddess Kali. Like Kali, Palden Lhamo's thangka is drawn in black colour, with flaming eyes, dressed in skirt made of tiger skin, and a garland of skulls around her neck. A moon disc adorns her hair, {{similar to the one}} seen on Shiva. She is also associated with Goddess Saraswati and Ma Tara. Legend also states that in the past she had lived in Sri Lanka as the consort of a demon king who practiced human sacrifice. As she was not supportive of this practice she fled from the kingdom. As she was running away, the king shot her shot with an arrow, which struck the backside of the mule that she was riding. When she drew out the arrow, it left a gaping hole in the mule's back, and through this gap Palden Lhamo <b>could</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> teachings of Lord Buddha.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} against Surrey {{and started the}} day after the Second Test. Brown injured a finger while fielding in the first innings, so {{he was not able to}} bat in Australia's first innings, in which Harvey made 43 before being run out. In the second innings, Harvey caught Surrey captain Errol Holmes from a leaping catch, snaffling the ball as it flew through a flock of pigeons. On the final day, Australia wanted to finish the run-chase quickly so they <b>could</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> Australian John Bromwich play in the Wimbledon tennis final. Harvey volunteered to play as a {{makeshift}} opener alongside Sam Loxton and promised Bradman that he would reach the target quickly. Australia chased down the 122 runs needed for victory in just 58 minutes to complete a 10-wicket win in just 20.1 overs. Harvey ended unbeaten on 73 and the Australians arrived at Wimbledon in time for the championship-deciding match.|$|E

5|$|The next {{match was}} against Surrey {{and started the}} day after the Test. Bradman wanted to allow his leading players a lighter {{workload}} after their effort at Lord’s, and Miller had an unauthorised night of partying and did not return to the team hotel until dawn, so Loxton opened the bowling, and he took two quick wickets to leave the hosts at 2/14. Loxton ended with 2/37 from 25 overs, sending down the most deliveries among the Australians, as the hosts were all out for 221. He made eight with the bat and again opened the bowling in the second innings, taking 1/53 from 18 overs. Australia needed 122 in the final innings to win, and Loxton and Harvey were promoted after the latter offered to open. Bradman’s men wanted to finish the run-chase quickly so they <b>could</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> Australian John Bromwich play in the Wimbledon final. Harvey and Loxton, who were roommates during the tour, made the runs in only 58 minutes in 20.1 overs, with Loxton unbeaten on 47, to complete a 10-wicket win.|$|E

25|$|ARPA {{was asked}} to {{consider}} the problem of using the technology in a cost-effective way, and noticed one possible application. As Soviet warheads were accurate to within only a few kilometers, {{and they had to}} fall within less than a kilometer to kill a missile silo, that meant the Soviets would have to launch several warheads at every US silo in a counterforce attack. The defender had a significant advantage here; they <b>could</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> incoming warheads, see if any were going to come within the lethal range of a silo, and then shoot just those ones. This meant a small number of ABMs would be effective against a huge number of Soviet warheads.|$|E
25|$|One other {{note about}} ABC {{baseball}} coverage during this period. Despite temporarily losing the Game of the Week package in 1961, ABC still televised several games {{in prime time}} (with Jack Buck returning to call the action). This occurred as Roger Maris was poised to tie and subsequently break Babe Ruth's regular season home run record of 60. As with all Major League Baseball games in those days, the action was totally blacked out of major league markets. As a matter of fact, as documented in the HBO film 61*, the Maris family was welcomed into ABC's Kansas City, Missouri affiliate KMBC-TV so they <b>could</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> in-house feed of the game, which was blacked out of Kansas City.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{his poor}} eyesight, Berry wore contact lenses when he played.

[...] "I even had tinted lenses for sunny days, so I <b>could</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> ball come right across the sun." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1958, courses {{cost about}} $200 each, and in 1963, {{students}} could earn a Harvard degree for roughly $1,000. [...] This was, according to Dean Reginald H. Phelps, [...] "a bargain that {{simply can not}} be matched anywhere in the field of education." [...] Adding to the value, study spaces, conferences rooms, library facilities, and a dining hall were set up in Lehman Hall for students in 1964.

500|$|After {{advancing}} to the league championship game in five {{out of the past}} six seasons, the Giants financial outlook was bright heading into the 1964 season. The team {{even went so far as}} to book movie theaters where fans <b>could</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> team's games for six dollars. However, the team struggled mightily, finishing 2–10–2 in 1964, beginning an 18-season playoff drought. This period in team history is often referred to as [...] "the wilderness years". In 1965, Jack Mara died, leaving his 50% share in the team to his son Tim.|$|E
