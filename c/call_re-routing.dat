40|$|Full text of {{this article}} is not {{available}} in SOARVoIP is an emerging technology aimed at leveraging the benefits offered by an IP network for both voice and data transmission. The integration of voice and data traffic onto a single network is led by a demand for multi-service applications over the global Internet. Even though the possibility of toll-bypass could result in considerable savings in long-distance calls, networks deploying VoIP face challenges in terms of packet loss, delay, scalability, reliability, inter-operability and lack of uniform standards. The Circuit Switch model within OPNET was used in the current work to quantify the performance of a VoIP network used in conjunction with a PSTN network. This study is tuned towards providing an easier migration path from a pre-dominantly circuit-switched telephony network to a converged network infrastructure. The focus of the current work is on the evaluation of the circuit switched model within OPNET 8. 0 with respect to call priorities and <b>call</b> <b>re-routing</b> during the migration processPeer reviewed articl...|$|E
40|$|A novel LEO/MEO two-tier {{satellite}} communication system with inter-satellite links (ISLs) is proposed for providing multimedia services to global mobile users. This two-tier system architecture {{can reduce the}} transmission delay for long-distance users via MEO satellites while keeping the benefits of using LEO satellites as the service access nodes. The routing and re-routing during a handoff operation is simplified. Since the physical topology of the underlying network is time-dependent, routing is crucial for guaranteeing the delay and delay variation performance for interactive applications. We decompose the routing problem into two parts, routing in the access network and routing in the core MEO ISL network. For the access network, a new routing algorithm called the maximum holding access protocol (MHAP) is proposed for minimizing the number of LEO handoffs. For core MEO ISL network, both minimum transmission delay routing (MTDR) and minimum transmission time jitter routing (MTTJR) are investigated. Using computer simulations, we show that the proposed routing algorithms can reduce the probability of <b>call</b> <b>re-routing</b> and thus are very suitable for providing interactive multimedia services. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|Wireless {{handsets}} {{are becoming}} increasingly multi-modal, supporting both cellular and wireless LAN air interfaces. When such a handset roams from one network to another during an active voice call, the <b>call</b> must be <b>re-routed</b> into the new network. The process of <b>re-routing</b> <b>calls</b> in this manner {{is referred to as}} a vertical handover. Achieving seamless WLAN-to-cellular handover can be very difficult {{due to the fact that}} WLAN coverage can often be lost long before a cellular call leg replacement can be established. A possible worse-case scenario occurs when mobile users walk from indoor building WLAN coverage to outdoors during voice connections. In this thesis, results from a measurement-based study of dual-mode handover are given. The presented results come from extensive IEEE 802. 11 measurements that were made on the McMaster University campus. These results give important insights into the difficulty of this problem, and relate to various system parameters such as WiFi deployment type and link loss threshold. The results show that it is almost impossible to successfully complete the handover unless the WLAN deployment ha...|$|R
5|$|Because works {{critical}} of {{the leadership of the}} Chinese regime are considered sensitive, Gui always kept his work projects secret; he kept his movements to himself and his telephone <b>calls</b> were <b>re-routed</b> through foreign countries. He went a long period without entering China; he did not visit his father when the latter was ill, and did not return to China for his father's funeral. Media sources reported that Gui had published about half of the popular books written on Bo Xilai. When Bo was caught in the political fallout from the Wang Lijun incident in 2013, Gui reaped a financial benefit of HK$10million from the surge in book sales. Gui's publishing financed his property acquisitions in Hong Kong and Germany, including a seaside retreat in Pattaya, Thailand.|$|R

The final recommendation rejected options that <b>called</b> for <b>re-routing</b> train traffic off of Capitol Hill {{in favor of}} new rail lines through Southern Maryland, which would have cost between $3.2 and $4.2 billion. Instead, the selected alternative would run trains through the Virginia Avenue Tunnel while {{a portion of the}} new project is constructed. Next, trains would use the new tunnel while a second one is completed. The plan proposed virtually guarantees a large increase in hazardous rail traffic only four blocks from the Rayburn House Office Building and the U.S. Capitol and will bring construction activity closer to private homes, U.S. Marine Barracks, and a home for senior citizens.|$|R
50|$|The Playhouse {{is located}} in the center of Ivoryton on the corner of Main Street and Summit Street (at 103 Main Street). The Playhouse has a small lobby, where the box office is housed, and then the theatre itself, which seats 284 people in both an {{orchestra}} and a balcony section. Behind the balcony is the control booth. Below the theatre are the dressing rooms and storage areas. Behind the Playhouse is a small barn-like structure where much set construction occurs. The Ivoryton Playhouse Foundation has its main offices in the Essex Industrial Park in Centerbrook, where the main rehearsal studio is also housed. The Foundation offices can be reached at (860) 767-9520. However, when the offices are closed, all <b>calls</b> are <b>re-routed</b> to the box office.|$|R

40|$|In MANET, power aware is {{important}} challenge issue {{to improve the}} communication energy efficiency at individual nodes. We propose modified efficient power aware routing (M-EPAR), a new power aware routing protocol that increases the network lifetime of MANET.

These nodes are driven by reactive protocols where broadcasting is mandatory to form a path between two nodes. So in case of death of the node resulting out of less battery <b>calls</b> for <b>re-routing.</b> Since many existing techniques focuses on energy aware routing this paper presents combination of energy aware routing merged with link quality determined by packet drop rate.

50|$|The older route via Guide Bridge {{remained}} a useful {{link between the}} northern and southern Manchester rail networks and this ensured its continued use during British Rail days, right up until the late 1980s - prior to May 1989, an hourly service ran on weekdays along the route and a regular service on Sundays (though the latter didn't <b>call</b> here). The <b>re-routing</b> of the Leeds - Huddersfield - Manchester express service to Piccadilly station at the May 1989 timetable change made the service essentially redundant though (travellers could then access south Manchester services directly at Piccadilly) and its frequency was substantially cut - by 1992 it had been reduced to just a single weekly train (the statutory minimum level necessary to avoid the requirement for formal closure proceedings).|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{transit network}} {{assignment}} is modelled {{based on the}} user equilibrium principle, according to which individual passengers are assumed to select paths that minimize their travel disutility. Models that follow this principle result in sub-optimal system performance when the transit lines become overcrowded. This study presents a new framework for the transit assignment problem to address the system performance of an overcrowded transit network while integrating individual travel needs. It proposes a novel approach, <b>called</b> System Optimal <b>Re-Routing</b> Transit Assignment Heuristic (SORTAH), which produces a user-constrained system optimal solution by {{reducing the number of}} overcrowded segments and spreading out the demand to better utilize routes that are under capacity. SORTAH minimizes the overall congestion effects of a transit network and leads to a better performing solution than that of a user equilibrium model, while simultaneously guaranteeing superior fairness compared to the pure system optimal model. A large-scale real-world application was conducted on the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) network. SORTAH was capable of reducing the number of overcrowded routes on the TTC network without adversely affecting the total travel time. Critical systemic gaps {{that need to be addressed}} in order to reduce the overall network congestion were uncovered. The study also revealed that realistic passenger paths are bounded by existing network design and capacity...|$|R
