40|$|Los Alamos National Laboratory is {{preparing}} excess nuclear material for shipment to Savannah River Site (SRS) for final disposition. Prior to shipment the nuclear material will be stabilized and packaged to meet strict criteria. The criterion {{that must be}} met include: (1) the DOE stabilization, packaging and storage requirements for plutonium bearing materials, DOE-STD- 3013, (2) shipping container packaging requirements, (3) SRS packaging and storage criteria, and (4) DOE Material Disposition criteria for either immobilization or MOX reactor fuel. Another issue in preparing for this transfer is the DOE <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> shipping <b>containers</b> and the availability <b>of</b> shipping <b>containers.</b> This transfer <b>of</b> the nuclear material is fully supported by the EM, DP and NN Sections of the DOE, as well as, by LANL and SRS, yet a strong collaboration is needed to meet all established requirements relating to stabilization, packaging, shipment, storage and final disposition. This paper will present the overall objectives, the issues and the planned strategy to accomplish this nuclear material transfer...|$|R

The program participants will carry out this work in a conditional phased approach, and the scope of work for subsequent years will evolve subject to developments in earlier years. The overall term of this cooperative program is planned to run roughly three years. 5 refs., 2 tabs...|$|R
40|$|The {{deployment}} {{and permanent}} operation of Space Station Freedom will enable researchers {{to enter a}} new era in the 21 st century, in which continuous on-orbit experimentation and observation become routine. In support of this objective, the Space Station Freedom Program Office has initiated the Express Payload Project. The fundamental project goal is to reduce the marginal cost associated with small payload development, integration, and operation. This is to be accomplished by developing small payload accommodations hardware and a new streamlined small payload integration process. Standardization of small payload interfaces, <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> small payload <b>containers,</b> and increased payload developer responsibility for mission success are key aspects of the Express Payload Project. As the project progresses, the principles will be applied to both pressurized payloads flown inside the station laboratories and unpressurized payloads attached to the station external structures. The increased access to space afforded by Space Station Freedom and the Express Payload Project has the potential to significantly expand the scope, magnitude, and success of future research in the microgravity environment...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the whole}} world {{container}} traffic, the largest share <b>of</b> <b>containers</b> is in the status <b>of</b> repositioning. <b>Container</b> repositioning results from the need for harmonization between the point <b>of</b> empty <b>container</b> accumulation and the point of demand, and waiting time for {{the availability of the}} first next transport of cargo. This status <b>of</b> <b>containers</b> on the container market is the consequence of imbalances in the worldwide trade distribution on most important shipping routes. The need for fast and effective reallocation <b>of</b> empty <b>containers</b> causes high costs and often represents an obstacle affecting the efficiency <b>of</b> port <b>container</b> terminals and inland carriers. In accordance with the above issue, this paper is mainly focused on the analysis of the data concerning global container capacities and the roots <b>of</b> <b>container</b> equipment imbalances, with the aim of determining the importance <b>of</b> empty <b>container</b> management and the need for empty container micro-logistic planning at the spread port area...|$|R
