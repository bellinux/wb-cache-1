5000|$|By the mid-1920s, {{a revised}} manual system where [...] "local" [...] toll {{operators}} connected tandem routes (a process formally called <b>Combined</b> <b>Line</b> and <b>Recording)</b> {{as needed to}} complete telephone calls, reduced the process {{to an average of}} two minutes, but still meant that some complex routing might interconnect as many as sixteen points. As long distance services grew in the Contiguous Continental US (48 states) and Canada, the amount of overhead equipment and people required to determine and establish Rates and Routes became excessive. As technology improved, network design included consideration of more automated and defined procedures. Thus, beginning with a switch installed in Philadelphia PA in 1943, AT&T began to automate the system, and establish a new switch hierarchy, which lasted until the breakup of AT&T in the 1980s.|$|R
