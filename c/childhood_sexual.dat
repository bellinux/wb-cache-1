50|$|Something Happened is Joseph Heller's {{second novel}} (published in 1974, {{thirteen}} years after Catch-22).

40|$|Objective This is an {{investigation}} into the prevalence and patterns of <b>childhood</b> forcible <b>sexual</b> abuse and victim-perpetrator relationship among secondary school students in the Northern Province (South Africa). Method 414 secondary school students in standard 9 and 10 in 3 secondary schools filled in a retrospective self-rating questionnaire in a classroom setting. The questionnaire asked for the demographic variables of the subjects, (physical contact forms of) sexual experiences of participants before the age of 17 years where the perpetrator used physical force to intimidate and dominate the victim or to achieve sexual gratification, and the victim-perpetrator relationship. Result It shows an overall prevalence rate for <b>childhood</b> forcible <b>sexual</b> abuse to be 16. 4 %; 8. 8 % for males, 15. 7 % for females. 9. 9 % were kissed sexually by force, 6. 8 % were touched sexually by force, 6. 1 % were victims of oral/anal/vaginal intercourse using force. The majority of the perpetrators were acquaintances or relatives of the victims. Conclusion The author pointed out some possible health and behavioural implications of forcible sexual abuse for the victims, and call for more {{research in the area of}} forcible sexual abuse in the Province, more publicity of the possible situation of raped or forcibly sexually abused children, and for more campaigns against <b>childhood</b> forcible <b>sexual</b> abuse and sexual abuse in general in the Province...|$|R

25|$|Early {{theories}} of the cause of anorexia linked it to <b>childhood</b> <b>sexual</b> abuse or dysfunctional families; evidence is conflicting, and well-designed research is needed.

Other psychological causes of anorexia include low self-esteem, feeling like there is lack of control, depression, anxiety, and loneliness.|$|E
25|$|In August 1996, Acremant wrote {{a letter}} to his {{hometown}} newspaper the Stockton Record stating that he had intended to rob Ellis and Abdill, and that knowing they were lesbians made it easier to kill them. He also wrote that he had killed Scott George, who was reportedly bisexual, because he had made a pass at him. Acremant also claimed to be a victim of <b>childhood</b> <b>sexual</b> abuse.|$|E
25|$|The {{intensity}} and reactivity of a person's negative affectivity, or tendency to feel negative emotions, predicts BPD symptoms {{more strongly than}} does <b>childhood</b> <b>sexual</b> abuse. This finding, differences in brain structure (see Brain abnormalities), {{and the fact that}} some patients with BPD do not report a traumatic history, suggest that BPD is distinct from the post-traumatic stress disorder which frequently accompanies it. Thus, researchers examine developmental causes in addition to childhood trauma.|$|E
25|$|Zoophilia {{may reflect}} <b>childhood</b> experimentation, <b>sexual</b> abuse {{or lack of}} other avenues of sexual expression. Exclusive desire for animals rather than humans is {{considered}} a rare paraphilia, and sufferers often have other paraphilias with which they present. Zoophiles will not usually seek help for their condition, and so do {{not come to the}} attention of psychiatrists for zoophilia itself.|$|R
50|$|Ageplay: {{where an}} {{individual}} acts and/or treats another {{as if they}} were a different age. The practice can be regressive, in which the goal is to re-experience <b>childhood,</b> or <b>sexual,</b> recreating a sexual relationship with people of the pretend and/or true ages. Generally this can involve someone pretending to be younger than they actually are, but more rarely can involve assuming an older role.|$|R
50|$|Novelist Benjamin Markovits {{produced}} a trilogy {{about the life}} of Byron. Imposture (2007) looked at the poet {{from the point of view}} of his friend and doctor, John Polidori.

25|$|The exact {{causes for}} the {{development}} of a particular sexual orientation have yet to be established. To date, a lot of research has been conducted to determine the influence of genetics, hormonal action, development dynamics, social and cultural influences—which has led many to think that biology and environment factors play a complex role in forming it. It was once thought that homosexuality was the result of faulty psychological development, resulting from childhood experiences and troubled relationships, including <b>childhood</b> <b>sexual</b> abuse. It has been found that this was based on prejudice and misinformation.|$|E
25|$|Findings {{have shown}} in {{specific}} cases that paranormal belief {{acts as a}} psychodynamic coping function {{and serves as a}} mechanism for coping with stress. Survivors from <b>childhood</b> <b>sexual</b> abuse, violent and unsettled home environments have reported to have higher levels of paranormal belief. A study of a random sample of 502 adults revealed paranormal experiences were common in the population which were linked to a history of childhood trauma and dissociative symptoms. Research has also suggested that people who perceive themselves as having little control over their lives may develop paranormal beliefs to help provide an enhanced sense of control.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{psychiatrist}} David Spiegel {{said that}} the inclusion of Landis' 1956 study was unjustified. He argued that, while weighting larger studies more than smaller makes sense, combining {{the results of a}} large study examining very mild trauma (such as fending off an attacker) with studies of long-term physical and sexual abuse was inappropriate and led to erroneous conclusions. Rind et al. replied that Spiegel misrepresented their analysis, since they did not use Landis' study in the meta-analysis of <b>childhood</b> <b>sexual</b> abuse – symptom correlations, but only for examining the self-reported effects of CSA. They contend that the way they handled Landis' data maximized negative reports and minimized the possible deflating effect of Landis' data on the overall effect sizes.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{arguments}} {{stem from}} disagreements {{over whether or}} not a given trait is actually an ascribed characteristic.

500|$|The {{family of}} Brandon Teena criticized Swank for her {{repeated}} {{use of the}} male gender pronoun [...] "he" [...] in her Oscar acceptance speech.

500|$|With {{the help}} of Kirstie McLellan Day, Fleury wrote his autobiography, Playing with Fire, which was {{released}} on October 16, 2009. In it, he alleged that he was sexually abused by Graham James {{over a period of}} two years. While he stated he [...] "doesn't want to become the poster boy for abuse by James", Fleury hoped that speaking out might make it easier for other <b>childhood</b> <b>sexual</b> abuse victims to come forward. He blamed the abuse for turning him into a [...] "raging, alcoholic lunatic", and claimed to have placed a loaded gun in his mouth and contemplated suicide in 2004. He revealed that he had spent most of his income on alcohol, drugs, gambling and women. Fleury also claimed that he failed 13 consecutive drug tests while playing for the Rangers, but that the league did not want to suspend him because he was a leading scorer. The league disputed this, and stated that its substance abuse program functioned appropriately.|$|E

An experimental group of 20 mothers in incestuous families and a control group of 20 mothers in nonincestuous families were selected. Each group shared family characteristics of having a daughter between the ages of 7 and 14. Three self-administered questionnaires were completed anonymously. The instruments were: 1) Early Childhood Memories questionnaire in which each respondent was asked to recall and describe in writing five early <b>childhood</b> memories, 2) <b>Sexual</b> Attitude questionnaire which contained 20 questions and 3) Background Information questionnaire asking about church involvement, religious affiliations and sexual and physical abuse in childhood.

LeMond continued, [...] "I decided that day that nobody's going to keep me from cycling, not Trek, not Armstrong, not Verbruggen, not anybody." [...] At the time, LeMond was alluding to a series of public and private disputes related to his anti-doping advocacy that hampered his enjoyment of cycling.
