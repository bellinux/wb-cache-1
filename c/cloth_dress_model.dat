50|$|Chesterfield {{was first}} settled in 1760 and was officially {{incorporated}} in 1762. It {{was named after}} the Earl of Chesterfield. The town center, established after the Revolution, has well-preserved Federal period houses along Main Road. In its early days, the town supported a largely agricultural economy, with wool from Merino sheep as a major product. However, there were sawmills and tanneries in operation as well as <b>cloth</b> <b>dressing</b> mills, {{and in the early}} 19th century these superseded farming and brought in a small immigrant population that was mostly Irish. Progress wiped out most of the industry in Chesterfield, and by the start of the 20th century a re-emerging agricultural economy developed alongside the growing trade from summer residents.|$|R
50|$|In the 14th century Frankfurt {{lacked a}} {{powerful}} mercantile upper class. Despite the fair, which already existed, trade was less established in Frankfurt {{than in other}} German cities. Therefore, many Frankfurt Jews worked as bankers and provided loans to craftsmen, farmers, and nobles from the area surrounding Frankfurt. As a side business, they often bought and sold pawned goods. This led to a small trade in horses, wine, and grain as well as <b>cloth,</b> <b>dresses,</b> and jewelry. Because of the limited market, these enterprises remained small. Based {{on the amount of}} tax paid by the Frankfurt Jews, the wealth of the community was inferior to that of the Jewish communities in Nuremberg, Erfurt, Mainz or Regensburg.|$|R

The study was conducted as a laboratory experiment with adult students at a leading European business university, in comparison to and in continuance of an earlier project on American Web sites with American students at a major university in the United States, in which the findings on media richness were replicated in this study.

50|$|Saw mills, grist {{mills and}} a forge were {{established}} {{on the banks}} of the Wynants kill at an early date, increasing in numbers as the demand warranted it. In 1800 a forge and saw mill were built by Thomas Thompson. Twenty-five years afterward Calvin Thompson built a mill, which was first run by Coleman & Heminway as a satinet mill. In the building hosiery was subsequently manufactured. About 1822 Ephraim Whittaker built a tannery {{on the banks of}} the creek. In 1862 James Aken built a hosiery mill on its site. For many years afterward it was operated successively by Jephtha Kidder, Kidder & McCreedy, Kidder & North, Nelson P. Aken and Nicholas P. Kane. Early in the century a cotton mill was run by Aretus Lyman. Conrad Aibridge also operated a similar establishment. Arnold & Robinson, then Isaac McConihe succeeded to the business. As early as 1819 Albertson's oil <b>cloth</b> <b>dressing</b> factory was in operation, which was abandoned many years ago. Two or three other concerns making cloth goods or knit goods were in operation in the town during the first half of the present century. Andrew J. Smart's paper mill was erected about 1847 or 1848 by Staats D. Tompkins, who sold it about 1865 to Eugene Merwin and John W. Merwin. Ten years later it became the property of Mr. Smart. John Van Heusen built a satinet mill about 1832 on the site of the old Knowlson mill. The building was burned in 1874, but rebuilt at once by Andrew B. Knowlson. Fonda & Sipperly had an early saw mill at Averill Park, and at the same point George Cipperley had a <b>cloth</b> <b>dressing</b> establishment soon after. In 1865 a hosiery mill was established on the same water privilege by John H. Akin and John Mc-Laren.|$|R
40|$|Activated carbon <b>cloth</b> <b>dressing</b> is an {{appropriate}} wound healing material due to its biocompatibility and adsorption characteristics. The in-fluence of gamma radiation as a sterilization process on the adsorption and mechanical properties of activated carbon cloth was investigated. The specific surface area, micropore volume, pore size distribution, surface chemistry {{as well as the}} breaking load of activated carbon cloth before and after gamma radiation were examined. Characterization by nitrogen adsorption showed that the activated carbon cloth was a microporous material with a high specific surface area and micropores smaller than 1 nm. Gamma radiation decreased the specific surface area and micropore volume but increased the pore width. The sterilization process changed the surface chemistry quantitatively, but not qualitatively. In addition, the breaking load decreased but without any influence considering the further application of this material...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To probe growth {{characteristics}} of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) cultured with alginate gel scaffolds, {{and to explore}} feasibility of wound <b>dressing</b> <b>model</b> of hUCMSCs-alginates compound. Methods. hUCMSCs were isolated, cultured, and identified in vitro. Then cells were cultivated in 100 [*]mM calcium alginate gel, and the capacity of proliferation and migration and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) were investigated regularly. Wound <b>dressing</b> <b>model</b> of hUCMSCs-alginate gel mix was transplanted into Balb/c mice skin defects. Wound healing rate and immunohistochemistry were examined. Results. hUCMSCs grew well but with little migration ability in the alginate gel. Compared with control group, a significantly larger cell number and more VEGF expression were shown in the gel group after culturing for 3 – 6 days (P < 0. 05). In addition, a faster skin wound healing rate with more neovascularization was observed in the hUCMSCs-alginate gel group than in control groups at 15 th day after surgery (P < 0. 05). Conclusion. hUCMSCs can proliferate well and express massive VEGF in calcium alginate gel porous scaffolds. Wound <b>dressing</b> <b>model</b> of hUCMSCs-alginate gel mix can promote wound healing through paracrine signaling...|$|R
