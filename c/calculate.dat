The calculations were done with the commonly used exchange-correlation functional B 3 LYP followed by a comprehensive analysis of the <b>calculated</b> highest-occupied and lowest-unoccupied Kohn-Sham orbital (HOMO and LUMO) energies. The basis set dependence of the DFT results shows that the economical 6 - 31 +G * basis set is generally sufficient for <b>calculating</b> the HOMO and LUMO energies (if the <b>calculated</b> LUMO energies are negative) for use in correlating with molecular properties.
