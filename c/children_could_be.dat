5|$|In November 1860, Tubman {{conducted}} {{her last}} rescue mission. Throughout the 1850s, Tubman {{had been unable}} to effect the escape of her sister, Rachel, and Rachel's two children, Ben and Angerine. Upon returning to Dorchester County, Tubman discovered that Rachel had died, and the <b>children</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> rescued only if she could pay a US$30 bribe. She had no money, so the children remained enslaved. Their fates remain unknown. Never one to waste a trip, Tubman gathered another group, including the Ennalls family, ready and willing to take the risks of the journey north. It took them weeks to safely get away because of slave catchers, forcing them to hide out longer than expected. The weather was unseasonably cold and they had little food. The children were drugged with paregoric to keep them quiet while slave patrols rode by. They safely reached the home of David and Martha Wright in Auburn, New York, on December 28, 1860.|$|E
5|$|While {{the church}} in Norway {{initially}} had refused to recognise Haakon as King of Norway, it had largely turned to support his claim to the throne by the 1223 meeting, although later disagreements occurred. Despite additionally having become the undisputed ruler of Norway after 1240, Haakon had still not been approved as king by the Pope due to his illegitimate birth. He nonetheless had a strong personal desire to be approved fully as a European king. Several papal commissions were appointed to investigate the matter, and Haakon declared his legitimate son Haakon the Young his successor instead of an older living illegitimate son. Although Haakon had children with his mistress Kanga the Young prior to his marriage with Margrete, it was his children with Margrete that was designated as his successors in accordance with a papal recognition. The Catholic principle of legitimacy was thus established in the Norwegian order of succession, although Haakon's new law still maintained that illegitimate <b>children</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> designated as successor {{in the absence of}} any legitimate children or grandchildren—contrary to Catholic principles. While his strong position allowed him to set boundaries to the church's political influence, he was on the other hand prepared to give the church much autonomy in internal affairs and relations with the rural society.|$|E

25|$|The Dutch West India Company {{introduced}} {{slavery in}} 1625 with {{the importation of}} eleven black slaves who worked as farmers, fur traders, and builders.

25|$|Numerous 19th- {{and early}} 20th-century {{contemporaneous}} documents {{indicate that the}} policy of removing mixed-race Aboriginal children from their mothers related to an assumption that the Aborigines were dying off. Given their catastrophic population decline after white contact (population shrank from 1,250,000 in 1788 to 50,000 in 1930), whites assumed that the full-blood tribal Aboriginal population {{would be unable to}} sustain itself, and was doomed to extinction. The idea expressed by A. O. Neville, the Chief Protector of Aborigines for Western Australia, and others as late as 1930 was that mixed-race <b>children</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> trained to work in white society, and over generations would marry white and be assimilated into the society.|$|E

25|$|Alternatively, Ernst (2008) advocates that {{efficient}} integration initially relies upon establishing correspondence – which sensory signals belong together. Indeed, {{studies have}} shown that visuo-haptic integration fails in adults when there is a perceived spatial separation, suggesting sensory information is coming from different targets. Furthermore, if the separation can be explained, for example viewing an object through a mirror, integration is re-established and can even be optimal. Ernst (2008) suggests that adults can obtain this knowledge from previous experiences to quickly determine which sensory sources depict the same target, but young <b>children</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> deficient in this area. Once there is a sufficient bank of experiences, confidence to correctly integrate sensory signals can then be introduced in their behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Sociobiologists have a {{different}} theory to Harris. Indeed, his theory and interest in the topic of infanticide is born of his more generalised opposition to the sociobiological hypothesis of the procreative imperative. According to this theory of imperative, based on the 19th-century vogue for explanations rooted in evolution and its premise of natural selection, the biological {{differences between men and}} women meant that many more <b>children</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> gained among the elites through support for male offspring, whose fecundity was naturally much greater: the line would spread and grow more extensively. Harris believes this to be a fallacious explanation because the elites had sufficient wealth easily to support both male and female children. Thus, Harris and others, such as William Divale, see female infanticide as a way to restrict population growth, while sociobiologists such as Mildred Dickemann view the same practice as a means of expanding it.|$|E

25|$|Fully {{autonomous}} vehicles, {{also known}} as driverless cars, already exist in prototype (such as the Google driverless car), {{and are expected to}} be commercially available around 2020. According to urban designer and futurist Michael E. Arth, driverless electric vehicles—in conjunction with the increased use of virtual reality for work, travel, and pleasure—could reduce the world's 800 million vehicles to a fraction of that number within a few decades. This would be possible if almost all private cars requiring drivers, which are not in use and parked 90% of the time, would be traded for public self-driving taxis that would be in near constant use. This would also allow for getting the appropriate vehicle for the particular need—a bus could come for a group of people, a limousine could come for a special night out, and a Segway could come for a short trip down the street for one person. <b>Children</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> chauffeured in supervised safety, DUIs would no longer exist, and 41,000 lives could be saved each year in the US alone.|$|E
25|$|Jerusalem was {{the center}} of {{education}} in the kingdom. There was a school in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where the basic skills of reading and writing Latin were taught; the relative wealth of the merchant class meant that their <b>children</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> educated there along with the children of nobles – it is likely that William of Tyre was a classmate of future king Baldwin III. Higher education had to be undertaken at one of the universities in Europe; the development of a university was impossible in the culture of crusader Jerusalem, where warfare was far more important than philosophy or theology. Nonetheless, the nobility and general Frankish population were noted for the high literacy: lawyers and clerks were in abundance, and the study of law, history, and other academic subjects was a beloved pastime of the royal family and the nobility. Jerusalem had an extensive library not only of ancient and medieval Latin works but of Arabic literature, much of which was apparently captured from Usamah ibn Munqidh and his entourage after a shipwreck in 1154. The Holy Sepulchre contained the kingdom's scriptorium and the city had a chancery where royal charters and other documents were produced. Aside from Latin, the standard written language of medieval Europe, the populace of crusader Jerusalem communicated in vernacular forms of French and Italian; Greek, Armenian, and even Arabic were used by Frankish settlers.|$|E
500|$|His {{plans for}} the Trust were, however, {{overtaken}} by events. Cromwell died in 1658 and Smith's arrangements were not entirely acceptable to the new regime. The Restoration period, which began around 1660 and saw Charles II become king, was not sympathetic to the Puritan beliefs of the Cromwellian Interregnum. Nonetheless, Smith's venture was able to survive the political upheaval and change in moral tone, albeit in modified form. That it did so was largely due to his wealth and connections, {{but also because the}} educational purpose for which his lands were being used was clearly beneficial and because he engaged in many lawsuits in order to protect both his own interests and those of family and friends. Referred to by his enemies as [...] "pious Erasmus with the golden purse", Smith came to an arrangement in 1667 which reduced the number of schools to three and required that he give £100 annually to one of Charles's favourite institutes, Christ's Hospital. The terms stipulated that although the schools were to be for the free education of children of Smith's tenants, they should each provide education on similar terms to a further 20 children from poor families, and that additional <b>children</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> schooled at a charge not to exceed two shillings.|$|E

500|$|Andriamasinavalona's {{reorganization}} {{and refinement}} of the subdivisions of the noble class {{took into account}} the precedents set by earlier Merina kings Andrianjaka and Ralambo.

[...] He also decreed that their tombs should be topped with a tranomasina, a small wooden house without windows or hearth and containing their worldly riches, where their spirit could return to visit after death. Unlike other noble subcastes, the Zazamarolahy were not constrained to inhabit a particular neighborhood, as Andriamasinavalona acknowledged the privilege of future sovereigns to determine the proximity of these most influential nobles according to the particularities of changing circumstances. Andriamasinavalona also narrowed the pool of potential future sovereigns by restricting this right to a new sub-group within the Zazamarolahy, which he termed Zanak'andriana ("Children of the Sovereign"). This group comprised all the descendents of the royal wives who had given birth to the king's four designated heirs. New rulers could only be selected from among this new sub-class of nobles.|$|E
500|$|Twenty years {{worth of}} {{research}} had showed that television, a [...] "cultural artifact" [...] accessible to most American <b>children,</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a [...] "powerful educational agent." [...] The show {{was designed and}} produced on the assumption that, since children are cognitively active when they watch television, a show could be an effective method of scientific education for young children by telling stories through pictures and by modeling behavior and learning. The creators and producers used film techniques to present information from multiple perspectives in many [...] "real world" [...] contexts, or situations within the daily experiences of young children. They wanted to provide their viewers with more [...] "authentic learning opportunities" [...] by placing problem-solving tasks within the stories they told, by slowly increasing the difficulty of these tasks, and by inviting their involvement. These learning opportunities included the use of mnemonics {{in the form of}} mantras and songs, and what Tracy called [...] "metacognitive wrap-up" [...] {{at the end of each}} episode, in which the lessons were summarized and rehearsed. The producers wanted to foster their audience's sense of empowerment by eliciting their assistance for the show's host and by encouraging their identification with the character Blue, who served as a stand-in for the typical preschooler.|$|E
500|$|Falle took a {{sustained}} interest in Bedford v.

When Falle first heard about this decision, she cried, and expressed surprise and disappointment. She said that she did not believe that the average Canadian realized the implications of striking down these laws, which she said were that [...] "your next door neighbours can run a brothel right beside you. Your <b>children</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> exposed to condoms left on their driveway, johns propositioning them." [...] She also expressed her concern that striking down anti-prostitution laws normalizes prostitution as a career option for children to consider. She also said that, without the laws, [...] "pimps will be legitimate businesspeople [...] billboards advertising brothels could start appearing on roadsides." [...] Ron Marzel, a lawyer attempting to have the anti-prostitution laws declared unconstitutional, said, [...] "the reality is there are consenting adults who want to go into" [...] prostitution. Falle was angered by this statement, and replied that 97% of women in the sex industry are not engaging in prostitution by choice, and that [...] "the voices of the overwhelming majority of women who {{want to get out of}} prostitution are being drowned out by a vocal few." ...|$|E
