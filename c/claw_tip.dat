40|$|This paper studies slide-resisting forces {{generated}} by claws in the free-walking beetle Pachnoda marginata (Coleoptera, Scarabaeoidea) {{with emphasis on}} the relationship between the dimension of the <b>claw</b> <b>tip</b> and the substrate texture. To evaluate the force range by which the claw can interact with a substrate, forces {{generated by}} the freely moving legs were measured using a load cell force transducer. To obtain information about material properties of the claw, its mechanical strength was tested in a fracture experiment, and the internal structure of the fractured claw material was studied by scanning electron microscopy. The bending stress of the claw was evaluated as 143. 4 - 684. 2 MPa, depending on the cross-section model selected. Data from these different approaches led us to propose a model explaining the saturation of friction force with increased texture roughness. The forces are determined by the relative size of the surface roughness R- a (or an average particle diameter) and the diameter of the <b>claw</b> <b>tip.</b> When surface roughness is much bigger than the <b>claw</b> <b>tip</b> diameter, the beetle can grasp surface irregularities and generate a high degree of attachment due to mechanical interlocking with substrate texture. When Ra is lower than or comparable to the <b>claw</b> <b>tip</b> diameter, the frictional properties of the contact between claw and substrate particles {{play a key role in}} the generation of the friction force...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{studied the}} {{external}} and internal pretarsus structure of the ants Brachyponera sennaarensis and Daceton armigerum {{in relation to their}} very different climbing ability. B. sennaarensis is a ground-dwelling species that is not able to climb vertical smooth walls. They have a pair of straight pretarsal claws with an average <b>claw</b> <b>tip</b> angle of 56 degrees, while the ventral tarsal surface lacks fine hairs that touch the substrate. They have no adhesive pad on the vestigial arolium, while the arolium gland is very small. D. armigerum, on the other hand, is an arboreal and thus well-climbing species with a very strong grip on the substrate. Their pretarsal claws are very hooked, with a <b>claw</b> <b>tip</b> angle around 75 degrees. They have dense arrays of fine hairs on the ventral tarsal surface, a well-developed arolium and arolium gland. These clearly different morphological characteristics are in line with the opposite climbing performance of both species...|$|E

40|$|Stable {{isotopes}} {{derived from}} the claws of birds {{could be used to}} determine the migratory origins of birds if the time periods represented in excised sections of claws were known. We investigated new keratin growth in the claws of adult female Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis) by estimating the equilibration rates of stable isotopes (δ (13) C, δ (15) N, and δ (2) H) from the breeding grounds into 1 mm <b>claw</b> <b>tips.</b> We sampled birds on their breeding ground through time and found that it took approximately 3 - 3. 5 months for isotope values in most <b>claw</b> <b>tips</b> to equilibrate to isotope values that reflected those present in the environment on their breeding grounds. Results from this study suggest that isotopes equilibrate slowly into <b>claw</b> <b>tips</b> of Lesser Scaup, suggesting isotopes could potentially be used to determine the wintering grounds of birds. We suggest using controlled feeding experiments or longitudinal field investigations to understand claw growth and isotopic equilibration in <b>claw</b> <b>tips.</b> Such information would be valuable in ascertaining whether <b>claw</b> <b>tips</b> can be used in future studies to identify the migratory origins of birds...|$|R

40|$|Exploring the {{relationship}} between phenotype and performance in an ecological and evolutionary context is crucial to understanding the adaptive nature of phenotypic traits. Despite their ubiquity in vertebrates, {{few studies have examined}} the functional and ecological significance of claw morphologies. Here we examine the adhesive toepad and claw system of Anolis lizards. Claw characters are significantly different between lizards classified as arboreal (perch height >= 1 m) and non-arboreal (perch height < 1 m). Arboreal species possess significantly higher and longer claws, and show trends toward decreased claw curvature and wider <b>claw</b> <b>tip</b> angles. Toepad size and claw length and height are tightly correlated {{with each other and with}} perch height, suggesting that the adhesive toepad and gripping claw have co-evolved to accommodate different habitats. The functional morphology and evolution of claws are ripe areas for future investigation...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{conditions}} on wintering or spring-staging areas may influence subsequent reproductive performance in migratory birds. These cross-seasonal effects {{may result from}} habitat loss and degradation (e. g., via contamination) which in turn reduce reproductive success, particularly in waterfowl that use stored nutrients for reproduction. North American lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) and white-winger scoter (Melanitta fusca) numbers have declined over the past 20 years, particularly in the boreal forest, and remain well below conservation goals, whereas ring-necked duck (A. collaris) numbers have increased. Environmental changes on scaup and scoter wintering and staging areas have raised concern about possible cross-seasonal effects on birds arriving on breeding grounds. The spring condition hypothesis (SCH) purports that many female scaup fail to acquire sufficient nutrients in late winter and spring, causing a decrease in breeding propensity and productivity. The contaminant hypothesis proposes that increased exposure to contaminants (particularly selenium [Se]) on wintering and staging areas has decreased scaup productivity. Accordingly, I compared body condition and studied Se concentrations in scaup, scoters and ringnecks to test the condition and contaminant hypotheses. Scaup had similar body condition to ringnecks, and had similar body mass compared to scaup collected near Yellowknife, NT, in 1968 - 70. There was no relationship between scaup and ringneck nutrient levels and <b>claw</b> <b>tip</b> carbon, nitrogen or hydrogen isotope values, suggesting that arrival body condition likely {{was not related to}} location or diet several months prior. Instead, scaup and ringnecks nutrient levels may be more affected by feeding or habitat {{conditions on}} or near the breeding grounds. Scaup had slightly higher liver Se concentrations than ringnecks, but levels in both species were below recognized harmful threshold concentrations; I found no relationship between Se and breeding propensity, or between Se and somatic lipid or protein stores. Scoters had much higher Se concentrations, yet contrary to predictions, there were positive relationships between Se and both lipid stores and breeding status. Follicle [Se] in scaup was below threshold concentrations; despite high liver Se in scoters, egg and follicle levels also were well below threshold concentrations. Using both body composition analysis and stable-isotope analysis I determined that scoters derive egg protein from their breeding ground diet, which likely prevents Se deposition from somatic protein to eggs, and egg lipids are apparently derived from somatic tissues. In all three species, liver Se concentrations were significantly correlated with <b>claw</b> <b>tip</b> ä 15 N. As the <b>claw</b> <b>tip</b> likely represents assimilated diet from 2 - 5 months prior to sampling, this correlation suggests that Se in these boreal breeding species is carried over from wintering and staging areas. Overall, results did not support either the spring condition or contaminant hypotheses. Scaup and scoters are late-nesting species, with highest pair densities occurring at the northern extent of their range. Maximum ring-neck pair densities occur at more southern latitudes. Ring-necks also nest earlier and appear to be more flexible in timing of nest initiation. Therefore, it is possible that due to climate change, early spring conditions alter the optimal timing of nest initiation to the detriment of late-nesting species such as scaup and scoters, and favour earlier nesters like ringnecks. Further research into this mismatch hypothesis is warranted...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of claws in different reptiles and their cornification are analyzed using histological, ultrastructural and autoradiographic methods. Claws develop {{at the tip}} of digits in relation to the growth of the terminal phalanx and appear as modified scales. The apical epidermis of digit becomes thickened and is associated with a mesenchymal condensation or a dense mesenchyme. The dorsal side of the digit becomes the unguis while the ventral side becomes the sub-unguis. The corneous layer in the unguis is thicker than in the sub-unguis and accumulates hard-keratin while corneocytes remain separated or partially fused. Bundles of hard-keratin tend to accumulate in parallel orientation with respect to the surface and are directed toward the <b>claw</b> <b>tip.</b> The sub-unguis is formed by a softer corneous material and by a much thinner hard-keratin layer. Autoradiography after tritiated thymidine and histidine injection indicates that the growth of reptilian claws occurs along the entire epidermis of the claw. A proximal matrix zone for cell proliferation like in mammalian nails and claws is therefore absent in claws of reptiles. This observation indicates that the pattern of growth of reptilian and probably avian claws is different from that of mammals...|$|E

40|$|The global {{decline in}} {{many species of}} migratory birds has focused {{attention}} {{on the extent of}} migratory connectivity between breeding and wintering populations. Stable-hydrogen isotope (&# 948;D) analysis of feathers is a useful technique for measuring connectivity, but is constrained by features of molt location and timing. Claws are metabolically inert, keratinous tissues that grow continuously and can be sampled at any point in the annual cycle, thus providing potentially useful clues about an individual&# 039;s previous movements. However, variation in the rate at which claws incorporate local &# 948;D values is not well described. We measured &# 948;D values in claws of two species of Neotropical-Nearctic migrant wood-warblers (Golden-winged Warbler and Cerulean Warbler) breeding in eastern Ontario, Canada to investigate the rate of &# 948;D change through the breeding season and the utility of claw &# 948;D values for estimating migratory origins. &# 948;D values of <b>claw</b> <b>tips</b> from 66 different individuals, each sampled once during the breeding season, showed an average change of - 0. 3  to - 0. 4  per day {{in the direction of the}} expected local Ontario value. There were no significant sex or species differences in the rate of change. These results suggest &# 948;D values of <b>claw</b> <b>tips</b> in Parulids may reflect those of the non-breeding area for 3 &# 8211; 7 weeks after arrival on the breeding grounds, and are useful estimators of non-breeding migratory origin. Our results also suggest that these species may leave the breeding ground before <b>claw</b> <b>tips</b> fully incorporate a local &# 948;D signature, as claws sampled at the end of the breeding season did not match locally grown feather and claw &# 948;D values. This is the first study to examine the seasonal rate of the change in &# 948;D values of claws in long-distance, insectivorous, migratory birds...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to gain a better {{understanding}} on how a mosquito uses its legs and feet to function in this world. Studying Scanning Electron Microscopy photos (SEM) of mosquitoes and comparing these to previous research and the SEMs of other insects, several hypotheses were made of the function of mosquito legs and feet. These educated speculations were supported in part by experiments which were used to determine the presence of protein and chitin using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrscopy (FTIR) and Coomassie Blue protein staining. The conclusions from this research are that a mosquito uses its claws to climb rough surfaces made of particles that are larger than the mosquito <b>claw</b> <b>tip.</b> Given this, a mosquito is able to hold onto the surface using friction. For smooth surfaces, the mosquito uses the setae on its foot for adherence. The foot pad excretes a fluid made of a water and lipid soluble substance that uses viscous forces to cause a sticky effect. Finally, its super-hydrophobic scales, made of chitin rods in a bed of protein, on its legs help to hold it up on the surface of water. The mechanics behind this continue to be explored...|$|E
40|$|The ostrich {{is highly}} {{specialized}} in terrestrial locomotion {{and is the}} only extant bird that is both didactyl and exhibits a permanently elevated metatarsophalangeal joint. This extreme degree of digitigrady provides an excellent opportunity for the study of phalangeal adaptation towards fast, sustained bipedal locomotion. Data were gathered in a semi-natural setting with hand-raised, cooperative specimens. Dynamic pressure distribution, centre of pressure (CoP) trajectory and the positional inter-relationship of the toes during stance phase were investigated using pedobarography. Walking and running trials shared a J-shaped CoP trajectory with greater localization of CoP origin as speed increased. Slight variations of 4 th toe position in walking affect CoP origin and modulation of 4 th toe pressure on the substrate allows correction of balance, primarily at the beginning of stance phase at lower speeds. Load distribution patterns differed significantly between slow and fast trials. In walking, the 3 rd and particularly the 4 th toe exhibited notable variation in load distribution with minor claw participation only at push-off. Running trials yielded a distinctly triangular load distribution pattern defined by the 4 th toe tip, the proximal part of the 3 rd toe and the <b>claw</b> <b>tip,</b> with the sharp point of the claw providing an essential traction element at push-off. Consistency of CoP trajectory and load distribution at higher speeds arises from dynamic stability effects and may also reflect stringent limitations to degrees of freedom in hindlimb joint articulation that contribute to locomotor efficiency. This novel research could aid in the reconstruction of theropod locomotor modes and offers a systemic approach for future avian pedobarographic investigation...|$|E
