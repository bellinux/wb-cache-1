It employs the method of artificial neural networks to derive appropriate coefficients. This approach may be extended to any of the charts previously introduced. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{new methods}} to monitor multiple data streams and report some quantity of interest over time. We consider two types of settings. First, we consider a data stream as realisations from a sequence of independent random variables that are revealed over time. To monitor the individual streams, we propose {{a new type of}} control chart, based on the <b>cumulative</b> <b>sum</b> <b>chart.</b> Cumulative sum charts are typically used to detect a change in the distribution of a sequence of observations, e. g., shifts in the mean. Usually, after signalling, the chart is restarted by setting it to some value below the signalling threshold. We propose a non-restarting <b>cumulative</b> <b>sum</b> <b>chart</b> which is able to detect periods during which the stream is out of control. Further, we advocate an upper boundary to prevent the <b>cumulative</b> <b>sum</b> <b>chart</b> rising too high, which helps to detect a change back into control. We prove that the non-restarting charts are optimal, in a well-defined sense. Further, we investigate the performance of these charts when the upper boundary is varied. Simulation results show a trade-off between the height of the upper boundary of the chart and the false signal rate. We then present an algorithm to control the false discovery rate across multiple data streams using the non-restarting charts. We consider two definitions of a false discovery: signalling out-of-control when the observations have been in-control since the start and signalling out-of-control when the observations have been in-control since the last time the chart was at zero. We prove that the false discovery rate is controlled under both these definitions simultaneously. Simulations reveal the difference in false discovery rate control when using these and other desirable definitions of a false discovery. In the second setting, a data stream is considered as observations of a Bayesian model revealed over time. The aim is to report a posterior summary of interest quickly and within a user-specified degree of accuracy. A system is presented to tackle such problems. The estimates are calculated using weighted samples stored in a database. The stored samples are maintained such that the accuracy of the estimates and quality of the samples is satisfactory. This maintenance involves varying the number of samples in the database and updating their weights. New samples are generated, when required, by a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The system is demonstrated using a football league model that is used to predict the end of season table. Correctness of the estimates and their accuracy is shown in a simulation using a linear Gaussian model. Lastly, potential improvements of the system are investigated. A series of motivating simulations illustrate some potential problems of the system. Remedial solutions are suggested, with a view toward implementation in the near future. Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the performance}} of a one-sided <b>cumulative</b> <b>sum</b> (CUSUM) <b>chart</b> that is initialized using a random starting point following the natural or intrinsic probability distribution of the CUSUM statistic. By definition, this probability distribution remains stable as the chart is used. The probability that the chart starts at zero according to this intrinsic distribution is always smaller than one, which confers on the chart a fast initial response feature. The article provides a fast and accurate algorithm to compute the in-control and out-of-control average run lengths and run-length probability distributions for one-sided CUSUM charts initialized using this random intrinsic fast initial response (RIFIR) scheme. The algorithm also computes the intrinsic distribution of the CUSUM statistic and random samples extracted from this distribution. Most importantly, no matter how the chart was initialized, if no level shifts and no alarms have occurred before time τ > 0, the distribution of the run length remaining after τ is provided by this algorithm very accurately, provided that τ is not too small.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{based on}} {{statistical process control}} was examined for the data mining problem of anomaly detection. This methodology does not suffer {{from many of the}} limitations of other data mining techniques often proposed for anomaly detection. This research demonstrated statistical process control has sound theoretical backing, has a linear time complexity, is accurate in classifying anomalies, and is able to identify novel information. Furthermore, it was shown that the contemporaneous use of numerous univariate statistical process control charts can address the prevalent problem of class imbalance. This research found that statistical process control based techniques are an effective method of temporal anomaly detection. Statistical process control based algorithms were developed and tested on a food industry complaint database of both frequent and infrequent Poisson distributed events. In applications of statistical process control, Shewhart charts are often used in conjunction with either exponential weighted moving average or <b>cumulative</b> <b>sum</b> <b>charts</b> for detecting both large and small shifts in a process quickly.

40|$|The {{standard}} <b>cumulative</b> <b>sum</b> <b>chart</b> (CUSUM) {{is widely}} used for detecting small and moderate process mean shifts, and its optimal detection ability for any pre-specified mean shift has been demonstrated by its equivalence to continuous sequential tests. In real practice, the assumption of knowing the true mean shift in prior cannot be always met. So it is desirable to design a procedure that is efficient for detecting a range of future expected but unknown mean shifts. Adaptive CUSUM control chart, which can continuously adjust itself by a one-step forecasting operator, has been proposed to detect efficiently and robustly {{for a range of}} mean shifts in the early literature. Moreover, in terms of sampling time to signal, control chart with the VSI (variable sampling intervals) feature can detect the process changes more quickly than the traditional FSI (fixed sample intervals) chart. In this paper, a new CUSUM control chart which is based on both adaptive and VSI features is discussed.

40|$|A {{graphical}} procedure {{suitable for}} prospectively monitoring surgical performance is proposed. The approach {{is based on}} accumulating evidence from the outcomes of all previous surgical patients in a series using {{a new type of}} <b>cumulative</b> <b>sum</b> <b>chart.</b> Cumulative sum procedures are designed to “signal ” if sufficient evidence has accumulated that the surgical failure rate has changed substantially. In this way, the chart rapidly detects deterioration (or improvement) in surgical performance while not overreacting to the expected fluctuations due to chance. Through the use of a likelihood-based scoring method, the cumulative sum procedure is adapted so that it adjusts for the surgical risk of each patient estimated preoperatively. The procedure is therefore applicable in situations where it is desirable to adjust for a mix of patients. Signals of the chart lead to investigations of the cause and to the timely introduction of remedial measures designed to avoid unnecessary future failures.

It is known that for some types of production processes, control charts based on the probabilities that the process is out of control can yield lower expected false alarm rates and expected times to signal than conventional charts such as the <b>cumulative</b> <b>sum</b> (these <b>charts</b> are called Bayesian charts). However, there has been no systematic investigation of how estimation of the production process parameters affects the performance of Bayesian charts.

This study aims to evaluate the performance of the Bayesian control chart (for monitoring changes in the process mean) with estimated parameters. The metrics that are used to measure the control chart performance are EFA (expected number of false alarms) and ARL 1 (average out of control run length). Monte Carlo simulations are performed to estimate the conditional and the marginal run length distributions.

The problem is approached statistically, as that of sequential (quickest) changepoint detection. A multi-cyclic setting of quickest change detection is a natural fit for this problem. We propose a novel score-based multi-cyclic detection algorithm. The algorithm {{is based on the}} so-called Shiryaev-Roberts procedure. This procedure is as easy to employ in practice and as computationally inexpensive as the popular <b>Cumulative</b> <b>Sum</b> <b>chart</b> and the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average scheme. The likelihood ratio based Shiryaev-Roberts procedure has appealing optimality properties, particularly it is exactly optimal in a multi-cyclic setting geared to detect a change occurring at a far time horizon. It is therefore expected that an intrusion detection algorithm based on the Shiryaev-Roberts procedure will perform better than other detection schemes. This is confirmed experimentally for real traces. We also discuss the possibility of complementing our anomaly detection algorithm with a spectral-signature intrusion detection system with false alarm filtering and true attack confirmation capability, so as to obtain a synergistic system.

40|$|This article proposes an {{adaptive}} absolute <b>cumulative</b> <b>sum</b> <b>chart</b> (called the adaptive ACUSUM chart) for statistical process control. The new development includes the variable sampling interval (VSI), variable sample size (VSS) and VSS and interval (VSSI) versions, {{all of which}} are highly effective for monitoring the mean and variance of a variable x by inspecting the absolute sample shift x m 0 j j (where m 0 is the in-control mean or target value of x). While the adaptive ACUSUM chart is a straightforward extension of the ABS CUSUM chart developed by Wu, et al., it is much more effective than all other adaptive CUSUM charts. Noteworthily, the superiority of VSI ACUSUM chart over the best adaptive CUSUM chart in literature is about 35 % from an overall viewpoint. Moreover, the design and implementation of the adaptive ACUSUM chart are much simpler than that of all other adaptive CUSUM schemes. All these desirable features of the adaptive ACUSUM chart may be attributable to the use of a single sample size (n = 1). Another quite interesting finding is that the simpler VSI ACUSUM chart works equally well as the more complicated VSSI ACUSUM chart. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Monitoring and {{detection}} of abrupt changes for multivariate processes {{are becoming increasingly}} important in modern manufacturing environments. Typical equipment may have multiple key variables to be measured continuously. Hotelling's 〖T 〗^ 2 and CUSUM charts were widely applied {{to solve the problem}} of monitoring the mean vector of multivariate quality measurements. Besides, a new multivariate <b>cumulative</b> <b>sum</b> <b>chart</b> (MCUSUM) is introduced where the target shift mean is assumed to be a weighted sum of principal directions of the population covariance matrix. In practical problems, estimated parameters are needed and the properties of control charts differ from the case where the parameters are known in advance. In particular, it has been observed that the average run length (ARL), a performance indicator of the control charts, is larger when the estimated parameters are used. As a first contribution we provide a general and formal proof of the phenomenon. Also, to design an efficient 〖T 〗^ 2 or CUSUM chart with estimated parameters, a method to calculate or approximate the ARL function is necessarily needed. A commonly used approach consists in tabulating reference values using extensive Monte-Carlo simulation. By a different approach in thesis, an analytical approximation for the ARL function in univariate case is provided, especially in-control ARL function, which can help to directly set up control limits for different sample sizes of Phase I procedure instead of conducting complex simulation. published_or_final_versionStatistics and Actuarial ScienceMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E

The production process is examined using the two types of charts under three specific control policies which are: Policy 1 - An assignable cause is sought if a single observation plots beyond the control limits, or if two successive observations plot within the control limits but beyond the warning limits. Policy 2 - An assignable cause is sought if a single observation plots beyond the control limits, or if two out of three observations plot within the control limits but beyond the warning limits. Policy 3 - An assignable cause is sought if a single observation plots beyond the control limits, or if seven successive observations plot within the control limits on any one side of the mean.

The new algorithm exploits the diagonalisation of the covariance matrix and uses various variance reduction techniques. Its performance is evaluated via a simulation study. The new method is designed for computing small exceedance probabilities. Secondly, we introduce a new omnibus <b>cumulative</b> <b>sum</b> <b>chart</b> for monitoring in survival analysis models.

Thirdly, we apply the method of adaptive multilevel splitting for the estimation of hitting probabilities and hitting thresholds for the survival analysis cumulative sum charts. Simulation results are presented evaluating the benefits of adaptive multilevel splitting. Finally, we extend the idea of adaptive multilevel splitting by estimating not just a hitting probability, but the whole distribution function up to a certain point.

40|$|We {{consider}} the general problem of simultaneously monitoring multiple series of counts, applied {{in this case}} to methicillin resistant "Staphylococcus aureus" (MRSA) reports in 173 UK National Health Service acute trusts. Both within-trust changes from baseline ('local monitors') and overall divergence from the bulk of trusts ('relative monitors') are considered. After standardizing for type of trust and overall trend, a transformation to approximate normality is adopted and empirical Bayes shrinkage methods are used for estimating an appropriate baseline for each trust. Shewhart, exponentially weighted moving average and <b>cumulative</b> <b>sum</b> <b>charts</b> are then set up for both local and relative monitors: {{the current state of}} each is summarized by a "p"-value, which is processed by a signalling procedure that controls the false discovery rate. The performance of these methods is illustrated by using 4. 5 years of MRSA data, and the appropriate use of such methods in practice is discussed.
