25|$|Growth {{rates for}} methanotrophic mussels at cold seep sites have been {{reported}} (Fisher, 1995). General growth rates {{were found to be}} relatively high. Adult mussel growth rates were similar to mussels from a littoral environment at similar temperatures. Fisher also found that juvenile mussels at hydrocarbon seeps initially grow rapidly, but the growth rate drops markedly in adults; they grow to reproductive size very quickly. Both individuals and communities appear to be very long lived. These methane-dependent mussels have strict <b>chemical</b> <b>requirements</b> that tie them to areas of the most active seepage in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result of their rapid growth rates, mussel recolonization of a disturbed seep site could occur relatively rapidly. There is some evidence that mussels also have some requirement of a hard substrate and could increase in numbers if suitable substrate is increased on the seafloor (Fisher, 1995). Two associated species are always found associated with mussel beds – the gastropod Bathynerita naticoidea and a small Alvinocarid shrimp – suggesting these endemic species have excellent dispersal abilities and can tolerate a wide range of conditions (MacDonald, 2002).|$|E

50|$|Common {{among all}} of the {{different}} specifications and types are the following steps: Prior to passivation, the object must be cleaned of any contaminants and generally must undergo a validating test {{to prove that the}} surface is 'clean.' The object is then placed in an acidic passivating bath that meets the temperature and <b>chemical</b> <b>requirements</b> of the method and type specified between customer and vendor. (Temperatures can range from ambient to 60 degrees C {140 degrees F}), while minimum passivation times are usually 20 to 30 minutes). The parts are neutralized using a bath of aqueous sodium hydroxide, then rinsed with clean water and dried. The passive surface is validated using humidity, elevated temperature, a rusting agent (salt spray), or some combination of the three. However, proprietary passivation processes exist for martensitic stainless steel, which is difficult to passivate, as microscopic discontinuities can form in the surface of a machined part during passivation in a typical nitric acid bath. The passivation process removes exogenous iron, creates/restores a passive oxide layer that prevents further oxidation (rust), and cleans the parts of dirt, scale, or other welding-generated compounds (e.g. oxides).|$|E
40|$|It is {{proposed}} that primary nucleation of amorphous microspherulites of hydrated silica in natural proto-precious-opal can {{be followed by}} a long range superlattice ordering process by means of electrostatic self-assembly. Necessary conditions in the thermodynamics are a high surface charge density on microspherulite surfaces, a long Debye length and an appropriate number density of nucleation centres. A further <b>chemical</b> <b>requirement</b> is a high alkaline environmental pH from 9 to 10. It is also proposed that the characteristic concentric spherical shell-like structure of spherulites, centred on primary nuclei, are due to sequential deposition of intrinsic salts which precipitate out when the corresponding solubility limits in the liquid are successively exceeded. It can be that the better-known sedimentation of microspherulites under gravity only plays part in the final stabilization period of overall growth. Comment: 12 pages pdf [URL]...|$|R

5000|$|In Europe, the {{comprehensive}} legislation addressing toy safety is the Toy Safety Directive of the European Union (EU), (Council Directive 88/378/EEC). This directive {{is a list}} of requirements toys must comply with, and is interpreted in the laws of each member state of the EU in their respective Toy Safety Regulations (e.g.: the UK's Toys (Safety) Regulations 1995 (Statutory Instrument 1995 No. 204)). This directive has been superseded by Council Directive 2009/48/EC which will apply to toy imports into or toys produced within the EU as of 20 July 2011 except for the <b>chemical</b> <b>requirements</b> of Annex II which apply as of 20 July 2013. During these periods the corresponding requirements of the previous directive will continue to apply. Compliance with both directives leads to a CE Mark, which is a mandatory requirement denoting conformity with all applicable directives. Some items specifically excluded from this legislation are: fashion jewellery for children, Christmas decorations, and sports equipment. Official guidance on the classification of toys in the EU has been provided by the EU Commission. [...] Where products are not classified as toys they will still be governed by the General Product Safety Directive. The toy safety directive provides for harmonised EU-wide standards on physical and mechanical properties, flammability, chemical properties and electrical properties but certain essential safety aspects of the directives are not governed by safety standards e.g. hygiene and radioactivity.The Toys Safety Directive (and subsequent Member State regulations) also calls for the closest applicable national or international standards to be applied where a standard is not specified in the Directive. This interpretive clause is present to ensure that new and innovative toys are safe before being placed on the market. The EN71 Toy Safety Standard has been harmonised by the EC as the default standard which toys must meet.If a toy is found to be unsafe (by breaching one of the specified standards, or by a manifest risk of injury not specified in standards) then the producer (the manufacturer, or the first importer into the EU of the product unit in question) is held to be guilty of an offence under the Toys (Safety) Regulations (or equivalent EU state law). The principle of due diligence (whereby the producer argues that all reasonable steps were taken {{to ensure the safety of}} the consumer with regards to the toy) may be used (in the UK) by the producer to avoid prosecution, fines and possible imprisonment. The unsafe toy is withdrawn from the EU market, with all member states' authorities being notified by means of the RAPEX alert system.|$|E

30|$|However, {{underground}} water generally contains iron and manganese compounds. As for manganese removal, its transformation from the soluble into insoluble form and {{separation of the}} generated oxides can be proposed. The most commonly used method is chemical oxidation combined with filtration or aeration combined with filtration by the MnO 2 containing materials [26]. Pyrolox™ is one of such materials. This is a mineral form of manganese dioxide used in water treatment for more than 75  years. It is suitable for iron, manganese, and arsenic removal especially at pH between 5 – 9. However, the higher the pH the higher are the oxidation capabilities. Therefore pH  6.5 or higher is considered ideal. A pH lower than 6.5 may require extra media for contact time. Advantages of Pyrolox™ are, among others, effective reduction of iron, sulfur and manganese, long service life, low coefficient of attrition, no <b>chemical</b> <b>requirement</b> for regeneration, and periodic backwashing due to high bulk density.|$|R
