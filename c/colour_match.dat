40|$|Based {{on earlier}} {{experiences}} of the colour mismatch phenomenon we investigated the <b>colour</b> <b>matching</b> with two types of visual experiments. First we confirmed the phenomenon with a white <b>colour</b> <b>matching</b> experiment using narrow band and broadband light sources illuminating white reflection patches. Secondly we made a <b>colour</b> <b>matching</b> experiment with more saturated colour stimuli. During both experiments the observers had the task to set the colour stimuli coming from the test side to that coming from the reference side of the arrangement. Using spectroradiometric measurement data we calculated chromaticities using the CIE standard <b>colour</b> <b>matching</b> functions and using a slightly modified set of CMFs kindly received from Dr. Wold. The calulations showed that using the modified <b>colour</b> <b>matching</b> functions the calculated colour differences will be smaller. This result is true in both matching situations. After the second series {{we came to the}} conclusion that the value of calculated colour difference is the function of the blue amount in the radiation...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{progress}} in tuneable solid-state light sources opens new opportunities in a niche and {{high added value}} lighting applications. The standard colorimetric technique of composing an identical colour coordinate metameric light spectra are facing the challenges due to the colour discrepancy noticed by the observers. A side-by-side <b>colour</b> <b>matching</b> experiment was performed with two tuneable tetrachromatic RAGB lamps (638 nm red, 598 nm pc amber, 518 nm green, 451 nm blue LEDs) to compare the colour of the metameres in a 10 -deg viewing angle. The metameric light matching was investigated using a 2 -deg (CIE 1931) and 10 -deg (CIE 1964) XYZ <b>colour</b> <b>matching</b> function. Both <b>colour</b> <b>matching</b> functions of standard colorimetric observers were shown to be inaccurate for aligning of metameric spectral power distributions without a noticeable difference in a perceived colour. On the other hand, a wide scatter of individual results revealed that the standard <b>colour</b> <b>matching</b> functions are inherently limited and in some cases, especially in professional lighting applications, the individually adjustable metameric lighting approach is to be considered...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDespite {{the recent}} advance made {{by using the}} direct methods of retinal densitometry, microspectrophotometry and suction electrophysiology, the psychophysical {{approach}} based on <b>colour</b> <b>matching</b> data still remains {{an important source of}} accurate information about the spectral sensitivity of the cone photoreceptors in the human visual system. However, the commonly used technique of estimating cone sensitivities, {{based on the assumption that}} dichromacy is caused by the lack of one of the three types of the cone photoreceptors, requires the <b>colour</b> <b>matching</b> functions not only from trichromatic observers but from dichromats as well. Here we evaluate an alternative approach, originally put forward by Bongard and Smirnov, that derives cone spectral sensitivities from <b>colour</b> <b>matching</b> functions only; without resorting to colour deficiency or any other data. When applied to CIE standard <b>colour</b> <b>matching</b> functions, this method yields curves of spectral sensitivities that are close to the classical Smith–Pokorny fundamentals, though the long-wave cone is shifted towards the short-wave region of the spectrum by 5 nm, as compared with Smith and Pokorny’s results...|$|R

While it is {{well known}} that multispectral imaging systems can measure the colour of fabrics that cannot be acquired by spectrophotometers, comparison of these two types of instrument has not yet been well explored. Colour measurements of 44 pairs of standard and batch solid-colour yarn-dyed fabrics by means of a Datacolor 650 spectrophotometer and an imaging colour measurement (ICM) multispectral imaging system were compared. Experimental results show that the ICM system has the capability to measure similar hue a* differences and larger lightness L* and hue b* differences than the Datacolor 650 spectrophotometer. When the tolerance of <b>colour</b> <b>matching</b> is set to 1. 0 CMC(2 : 1) (colour difference) unit, the ICM system can achieve the same <b>colour</b> <b>matching</b> results as the Datacolor 650 spectrophotometer, except for two dark samples.

50|$|Scoring of the {{sequence}} alignment is done by comparing each of the player-aligned sequences with an algorithm-determined ancestral sequence generated at each node. A <b>colour</b> <b>match</b> yields +1 to the score, a mismatch yields -1, an opening of a gap yields -5, and an extension of any existing gap yields -1. The sum of all comparisons is then determined every several seconds, which provides the final score for that player's alignment. For each puzzle, only a few sequences are initially available {{at the beginning of}} the game. A computer-determined par score must be beaten by the player before moving on to the next round and unlocking more sequences to match. A player wins and is allowed to submit their sequence alignment to the database by matching or surpassing the final par score generated by the computer for each puzzle.|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} performance of three posterior composites and two amalgams was evaluated over 3 years. Three hundred and nine composites and 200 amalgams were reviewed at the 3 -year recall.

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the reliability and}} reproducibility of the Spectromatch-Pro digital colour system (Spectromatch Ltd. UK) in the reproduction of simulated skin-silicone colour samples; and to determine threshold Delta E (∆E) (CIE L*a*b*) of perceptible and acceptable colour differences for maxillofacial prosthetics. Method: A two phase quantitative research design. Phase 1 : tested; (i) the reproducibility of the spectrophotometer for eight subjects (n= 48) scans; from four ethnic groups White, Chinese, Asian and Black. (ii) minimum silicone-skin sample thickness for colour scanning; and (iii) reproducibility of simulated silicone-skin samples formulae recipe. Phase 2 : Determine the perceptible and acceptable <b>colour</b> <b>match</b> difference between colour silicone-skin samples and human skin for 8 subjects'; from baseline colour scan, an in-built colour L*a*b* gradient scales 0 - 8 at 0. 5 ∆E increments were formulated. Silicones samples (n= 776) were processed; perceptible and acceptable colour difference (∆E) assessed by (n= 12) colour assessors. Results: The spectrophotometer skin colour scans for White, Chinese Indian and Black ethnic groups demonstrated positive correlation (r= 0. 99). Scanner reproducibility for the eight subjects, Mean ± SD, ∆E maximum (1. 43 ± 0. 63), to minimum (0. 47 ± 0. 21); colour formulae silicone sample achieved an acceptable <b>colour</b> <b>match</b> of 0. 43 ∆E to 1. 36 ∆E. The minimum silicone sample thickness (mm); for light to dark skin tones was 8 mm (White 6 mm; Black 8 mm). Pigment formula-sample reproducibility (Mean ∆E and SD) maximum (1. 36 ± 0. 29), minimum (0. 43 ± 0. 16). The acceptable colour difference threshold for skin simulated medical elastomers for four ethnic groups 1. 54 ∆E, White 1. 61 ∆E; Chinese 1. 87 ∆E; Indian was not detectable; and Black 2. 33 ∆E. Perceptible and acceptable colour difference (L*a*b*) CIE for L* (Light/dark) for all subjects 1. 68 to 3. 18 ∆E; for a* (red/green), the scores were below 2 cut off point (not acceptable); and for b* (blue/yellow) 1. 58 to 0. 51 ∆E. Conclusion: This study has established the reproducibility of the Spectromatch digital colour system; and objectively defined the perceptible and acceptable (∆E) thresholds (1) for facial prosthetics (Mean ∆E 1. 54), (2) the relationship to human eye sensitivity and the perceptibility / acceptability for silicone-skin <b>colour</b> <b>match</b> for maxillofacial prosthetics...|$|E
