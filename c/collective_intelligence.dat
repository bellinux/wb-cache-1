25|$|The term group {{intelligence}} is sometimes used interchangeably {{with the term}} <b>collective</b> <b>intelligence.</b> Anita Woolley presents <b>Collective</b> <b>intelligence</b> {{as a measure of}} group intelligence and group creativity. The idea is that a measure of <b>collective</b> <b>intelligence</b> covers a broad range of features of the group, mainly group composition and group interaction. The features of composition that lead to increased levels of <b>collective</b> <b>intelligence</b> in groups include criteria such as higher numbers of women in the group as well as increased diversity of the group.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} concepts in artificial intelligence is the notion of the swarm. That is, intelligent adaptive behaviour can arise in large groups of interacting agents, even when the individual agents have limited local information and use simple rules. Self-organisation provides a basic structure in such agent societies, while natural selection can drive the evolution of increasingly efficient and coordinated interactions through improved communication, information processing, and agent specialisation. Such <b>collective</b> <b>intelligences</b> have evolved in diverse biological contexts, ranging from foraging and home-building colonies of ants, termites and bees, to the coordinated movements of vertebrate flocks and schools, to the exquisitely tuned dynamical responses of immune and neural systems.

25|$|<b>Collective</b> <b>intelligence</b> {{strongly}} {{contributes to}} the shift of knowledge and power from the individual to the collective. According to Eric S.

Media theorist Henry Jenkins sees <b>collective</b> <b>intelligence</b> as an 'alternative source of media power', related to convergence culture. He draws attention to education and the way people are learning to participate in knowledge cultures outside formal learning settings. Henry Jenkins criticizes schools which promote 'autonomous problem solvers and self-contained learners' while remaining hostile to learning through the means of <b>collective</b> <b>intelligence.</b> Both Pierre Lévy (2007) and Henry Jenkins (2008) support the claim that <b>collective</b> <b>intelligence</b> is important for democratization, as it is interlinked with knowledge-based culture and sustained by collective idea sharing, and thus contributes {{to a better understanding}} of diverse society.|$|E

25|$|Woolley, Chabris, Pentland, Hashmi, & Malone (2010), the originators of this {{scientific}} understanding of <b>collective</b> <b>intelligence,</b> found a single statistical factor for <b>collective</b> <b>intelligence</b> in their research across 192 groups with people randomly {{recruited from the}} public. In Woolley et al.'s two initial studies, groups worked together on different tasks from the McGrath Task Circumplex, a well-established taxonomy of group tasks. Tasks were chosen from all four quadrants of the circumplex and included visual puzzles, brainstorming, making collective moral judgments, and negotiating over limited resources. The results in these tasks were taken to conduct a factor analysis. Both studies showed support for a general <b>collective</b> <b>intelligence</b> factor c underlying differences in group performance with an initial eigenvalue accounting for 43% (44% in study 2) of the variance, whereas the next factor accounted for only 18% (20%). That fits the range normally found in research regarding a general individual intelligence factor g typically accounting for 40% to 50% percent of between-individual performance differences on cognitive tests.|$|E
25|$|A new {{scientific}} understanding of <b>collective</b> <b>intelligence</b> defines it as a group's general {{ability to perform}} {{a wide range of}} tasks. Definition, operationalization and statistical methods are similar to the psychometric approach of general individual intelligence. Hereby, an individual's performance on a given set of cognitive tasks is used to measure general cognitive ability indicated by the general intelligence factor g extracted via factor analysis. In the same vein as g serves to display between-individual performance differences on cognitive tasks, <b>collective</b> <b>intelligence</b> research aims to find a parallel intelligence factor for groups c factor' (also called 'collective intelligence factor' (CI)) displaying between-group differences on task performance. The <b>collective</b> <b>intelligence</b> score then is used to predict how this same group will perform on any other similar task in the future. Yet tasks, hereby, refer to mental or intellectual tasks performed by small groups even though the concept is hoped to be transferrable to other performances and any groups or crowds reaching from families to companies and even whole cities. Since individuals' g factor scores are highly correlated with full-scale IQ scores, which are in turn regarded as good estimates of g, this measurement of <b>collective</b> <b>intelligence</b> can also be seen as an intelligence indicator or quotient respectively for a group (Group-IQ) parallel to an individual's intelligence quotient (IQ) even though the score is not a quotient per se.|$|E
25|$|Gladwell (2008) {{showed that}} the {{relationship}} between individual IQ and success works only to a certain point and that additional IQ points over an estimate of IQ 120 do not translate into real life advantages. If a similar border exists for Group-IQ or if advantages are linear and infinite, has still to be explored. Similarly, demand for further research on possible connections of individual and <b>collective</b> <b>intelligence</b> exists within plenty of other potentially transferable logics of individual intelligence, such as, for instance, the development over time or the question of improving intelligence. Whereas it is controversial whether human intelligence can be enhanced via training, a group's <b>collective</b> <b>intelligence</b> potentially offers simpler opportunities for improvement by exchanging team members or implementing structures and technologies. Moreover, social sensitivity was found to be, at least temporarily, improvable by reading literary fiction as well as watching drama movies. In how far such training ultimately improves <b>collective</b> <b>intelligence</b> through social sensitivity remains an open question.|$|E

All papers were originally presented at the 11 th International KES Conference on Agents and Multi-Agent Systems – Technologies and Applications (KES-AMSTA 2017) held June 21 – 23, 2017 in Vilamoura, Algarve, Portugal. Today’s economy is driven by technologies and knowledge. Digital technologies can free, shift and multiply choices, and often intrude on the territory of other industries by providing new ways of conducting business operations and creating value for customers and companies. The topics covered in this volume include software agents, multi-agent systems, agent modeling, mobile and cloud computing, big data analysis, business intelligence, artificial intelligence, social systems, computer embedded systems and nature inspired manufacturing, etc., all of which contribute to the modern Digital Economy. The results presented here will be of theoretical and practical value to researchers and industrial practitioners {{working in the fields}} of artificial <b>intelligence,</b> <b>collective</b> computational <b>intelligence,</b> innovative business models, the new digital and knowledge economy and, in particular, agent and multi-agent systems, technologies, tools and applications...|$|R
