Ten years later, in 1850, the second DeKalb <b>County</b> <b>Courthouse</b> was erected. From December 13, 1902 until April 17, 1924, DeKalb-Sycamore Electric Traction Company operated a trolley route between the two cities (DeKalb and Sycamore), which ended at the DeKalb <b>County</b> <b>Courthouse.</b> The current courthouse, which sits on the same site as the 1850 building, was erected in 1905.|$|E

5|$|The {{third and}} current DeKalb <b>County</b> <b>Courthouse</b> was {{constructed}} in 1905 at an approximate cost of $137,000. The project reignited {{the debate over the}} county courthouse's location and, once again, the debate over which town would hold the coveted title of county seat. The county Board of Supervisors authorized the project in 1901 and appropriated $100,000 for the new building. The idea for a new courthouse originated as early as 1900, when the essential design elements of the Lee <b>County</b> <b>courthouse</b> were chosen as the model for the new DeKalb <b>County</b> <b>Courthouse.</b> Though the courthouse was modeled after the Lee County structure it does differ; the Lee County building, in Dixon, Illinois, has a rooftop dome and also is longer and wider than the DeKalb County building. By 1903, the appropriation had been upped to $140,000 and the battle over the county seat had begun.|$|E

5|$|The first <b>county</b> <b>courthouse</b> {{was a small}} log building. When Corydon {{became the}} {{territory}} capital in 1813, county and territorial officials shared the building. By 1816 a stone building had been constructed, and it served as both Harrison <b>County</b> <b>Courthouse</b> and the state capital building until the capital was moved. As more space was needed, other buildings were constructed to supplement the courthouse. In the 1920s, the latest of these office buildings was razed {{to make way for}} a new courthouse; the old building was acquired by the State of Indiana and preserved as the first state capitol building. The new courthouse was built from 1927 to 1928 at a cost of about $250,000. The building was designed by Fowler and Karges of Evansville and was constructed by J. Fred Beggs and Company of Scottsburg.|$|E
