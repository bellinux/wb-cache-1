In this paper, we define three substitutability notions for services.

To guarantee that S 0 <b>cooperates</b> <b>with</b> a fixed subset of environments that S <b>cooperates</b> <b>with,</b> the notion of deprecation can be used. For each substitutability notion we present a decision algorithm. To this end we apply the concept of an operating guideline of a service as an abstract representation of all environments the service <b>cooperates</b> <b>with...</b>|$|R

5|$|According to Israeli {{historian}} Shai Lachman, between 1921 and 1935 al-Qassam often <b>cooperated</b> <b>with</b> Hajj Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. They {{were initially}} on good terms, and al-Qassam's various official appointments required the mufti's prior consent. He suggests their cooperation increased after the 1929 riots, {{in which one}} source claims al-Qassam's men were active. The two fell out in the mid-1930s, perhaps due to al-Qassam's independent line of activism. In 1933, al-Qassam sent an emissary to al-Husseini, requesting the latter's participation in a revolt against the British. At the time, al-Husseini refused, preferring a political solution.|$|E
