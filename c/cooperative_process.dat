25|$|In the tetrameric form {{of normal}} adult hemoglobin, the binding of oxygen is, thus, a <b>cooperative</b> <b>process.</b> The binding {{affinity}} of hemoglobin for oxygen is increased by the oxygen saturation of the molecule, {{with the first}} molecules of oxygen bound influencing {{the shape of the}} binding sites for the next ones, in a way favorable for binding. This positive cooperative binding is achieved through steric conformational changes of the hemoglobin protein complex as discussed above; i.e., when one subunit protein in hemoglobin becomes oxygenated, a conformational or structural change in the whole complex is initiated, causing the other subunits to gain an increased affinity for oxygen. As a consequence, the oxygen binding curve of hemoglobin is sigmoidal, or S-shaped, as opposed to the normal hyperbolic curve associated with noncooperative binding.|$|E

In contrast, <b>cooperative</b> <b>processes</b> {{emphasize the}} sharing of artefact, and its gradual evolution toward the final product, under the cooperative and concurrent activities of all the involved actors. This paper contrasts workflow and <b>cooperative</b> <b>processes</b> and shows {{that they are more}} complementary than conflicting and that, provided some extensions, both approaches can fit into a single tool and formalism. The paper presents Celine, a concurrent engineering tool that can also define and support classic workflows and software processes. We claim that the availability of both classes of features allows for the modelling and support of very flexible processes, closer to software engineering reality. 1...|$|R
