40|$|International audienceSmall-scale {{fisheries}} {{are commonly}} little {{understood as a}} consequence of a crucial lack of data. This is also true for European fisheries, where vessels less than 12 m represent almost 75 % of the total fleet. This paper details a methodology developed to estimate catches and fishing effort <b>of</b> small-scale <b>vessels</b> by sampling fishing trips on-site. The benefits of using auxiliary census data, the annual activity calendars collected by the Fisheries Information System (FIS), to improve the precision of the estimates are evaluated. Sampling schemes to estimate catches and fishing effort need to take account of the variability resulting from different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels,</b> métiers, zones, and seasonality. To meet this objective, the methodology used here aims to optimize the sampling effort's allocation according to the diversity of métiers and the intensity of activity in each harbour. Different methods for the extrapolation of catch and effort data have been tested {{on the basis of the}} métiers and on the typologies of fleets. The results obtained are presented and their accuracy discussed. For Réunion Island, our estimation by sampling is compared with the declared fishing forms...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{tracking}} {{is important}} for maritime situational awareness to identify currently observed ships as earlier encounters. In cases of, for example, piracy and smuggling, past location and behavior analysis are useful {{to determine whether a}} ship is of interest. Furthermore, it is beneficial to make this assessment with sensors (such as cameras) at a distance, to avoid costs of bringing an own asset closer to the ship for verification. The emphasis of the research presented in this paper, is on the use of several feature extraction and matching methods for recognizing ships from electro-optical imagery within different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels.</b> We compared central moments, SIFT with localization and SIFT with Fisher Vectors. From the evaluation on imagery of ships, an indication of discriminative power is obtained between and within different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> ships. This is used to assess the usefulness in persistent tracking, from short intervals (track improvement) to larger intervals (re-identifying ships). The result of this assessment on real data is used in a simulation environment to determine how track continuity is improved. The simulations showed that even limited recognition will improve tracking, connecting both tracks at short intervals as well as over several days. © (2014) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

Dolphins changed direction least when multiple boat activities occurred while animals reoriented most when no boats were present. Differences in the directness of groups' travel path were seen among various <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> traffic. Pairs <b>of</b> mothers and calves were closely associated when vessels were present; pairs were farther apart when no boats were in the study site, although this difference was not significant.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Quantification of microvessels {{in solid}} {{malignancies}} {{is regarded as}} a potential test to predict their clinicobiologic behavior. However, discordant results have been reported for head and neck cancer that may be explained by varying methods. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we therefore quantified the microvasculature in 20 nonmetastasized and 20 metastasized squamous cell carcinomas of the tongue, using recently developed methods. For immunohistochemical visualization <b>of</b> the <b>vessels,</b> we used anti-CD 34 with a signal amplification step based on the catalyzed deposition of biotinylated tyramine. This protocol results in enhanced staining quality compared with standard protocols. For each tumor, a representative tissue section was systematically sampled with 40 to 60 standardized test fields. True color image analysis system was used to measure microvessel density (MVD) and to obtain additional information with regard to size <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels.</b> RESULTS: Remarkably, in the group of nonmetastasized tumors, the MVD was greater than in the metastasized tumors (p =. 007). However, the microvessels with a diameter in the range of 10 to 15 microm predominated in the group of metastasized tongue carcinomas (p =. 03). A logistic regression model based on the percentage <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> smaller than 5 microm, classified 85 % of patients with a metastasized tumor correctly and 75 % of patients with a nonmetastasized tumor, independently of the clinical stage of the tumor. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that only vessels with a diameter larger than 10 microm, consistent with functional vessels, {{play a role in the}} process of metastasis. Further research more specifically into structural and functional characterization of blood and lymphatic vessels might help provide more insight into the relationship between microvasculature and the pathogenesis of metastasis in tongue carcinomas...|$|R
40|$|Summary The {{anatomical}} features <b>of</b> earlywood <b>vessels</b> of-ten reflect {{information about}} past climatic conditions. We ex-amined {{the relationships between}} mean monthly temperature and mean vessel lumen area (MVA) in various <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> earlywood <b>vessels.</b> Subsets <b>of</b> earlywood <b>vessels</b> <b>of</b> chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) were selected from a previously re-ported dataset based on several progressive size-related proce-dures. To include all earlywood vessels, the minimum size considered was 10, 000 µm 2. Changes in the correlations be-tween MVA and the mean air temperature in March are de-scribed and discussed. The results show that not all vessels embody the same information. The MVA of a proportion of the largest earlywood vessels in each annual ring was most closely related to March temperature, whereas MVA of the smallest earlywood vessels was better correlated with June temperature. This difference is probably a result <b>of</b> the <b>vessels</b> being formed at different times: early spring for the largest earlywood vessels and later in spring for the smallest earlywood vessels. Analyses combining large and small vessels yielded lower correlations between MVA and monthly temperature. The number, size and distribution <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> can vary greatly from ring to ring. In making year-to-year comparisons, the best information is pro-vided by observations on <b>vessels</b> <b>of</b> contemporaneous onto-genesis. Criteria for the selection and analysis <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> {{in the assessment of}} temperature during the season of wood forma-tion are proposed and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background: Skeletal {{muscle fibers}} have a {{remarkable}} capacity {{to adjust their}} molecular, functional, and metabolic properties in response to developmental and environmental stimuli. A central role for neuromuscular activity in determining skeletal muscle fibers composition was demonstrated by cross-innervation and electrical stimulation experiments in adult skeletal muscle. A fast to slow transition can be induced by chronic low-frequency electrical stimulation (CLFS). In literature, CLFS {{studies have focused on}} the effects produced after days or weeks of stimulation. Here, I present the first transcriptome study that identifies the earliest genetic changes in this process. Methods: The fast EDL muscle was subjected to CLFS for 6 and 12 hours. First, microarray experiments were performed using whole EDL muscle. Then, in order to reduce biological noise caused by different cell types, I applied microgenomic analyses at the level of single fibers (SF), isolated according to the protocol recently developed in my laboratory. Microarray experiments have been produced with updated platforms (Agilent SurePrint G 3 Mouse GE 8 x 60 K). Results and discussion: The expression profiles of whole muscle after 6 and 12 hours of electrical stimulation identified about two hundred differentially expressed (DE) genes. The functional <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> blood <b>vessel</b> development and transcription regulation were most enriched. Genomic analyses of isolated fibers identified more than a thousand DE genes after 12 hours of stimulation. The functional <b>category</b> <b>of</b> blood <b>vessel</b> development was enriched also at the SF level, suggesting that myofibers are able to interact with other cell types in order to stimulate the angiogenesis process. In general, muscle structural genes were equally expressed between stimulated and unstimulated muscles, indicating that changes in fiber type require prolonged stimulation. On the contrary, genes involved in transcription, chromatin-remodeling genes and several myofibril genes acting as signaling molecule were early activated after CLFS. ...|$|R

40|$|Background. After the {{introduction}} of sidestream darkfield imaging (SDF) of the microcirculation, {{it has become clear}} that in sepsis, microcirculatory alterations can exist in the absence of systemic haemodynamic abnormalities. However, it is unclear whether this phenomenon also occurs in the treatment of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) where alterations in the volume status of patients occur during dialysis. We tested the hypothesis that volume changes during dialysis directly affect the perfusion of the microcirculation in a group of adult haemodialysis patients. Secondly, we evaluated microcirculatory response to autotransfusion using the Trendelenburg position (TP). Methods. Patients who were on chronic intermittent haemodialysis were assessed for sublingual microvascular flow by SDF imaging pre- and post-TP, performed before and after ultrafiltration (UF). Sublingual microvascular flow was estimated using a semi-quantitative microvascular flow index (MFI) in small (diameter < 25 mu m, which includes capillaries), medium (25 - 50 mu m) and large-sized (50 - 100 mu m) microvessels (no flow: 0, intermittent flow: 1, sluggish flow: 2 and continuous flow: 3). Changes were evaluated with the non-parametric paired Wilcoxon test. P < 0. 05 was judged to indicate a significant difference. Results. Thirty-nine adult patients took part in the study. The underlying diseases causing ESKD were predominantly hypertension (HT, n = 10), diabetes mellitus (DM, n = 7) or both (n = 3). At the start of UF, microvascular flow did not change significantly by TP. After completion of UF, MFI had decreased significantly in all types of microvessels (P < 0. 001). After UF (median volume extraction 2. 491), MFI was lower than that at the start of UF and increased in most patients after TP (P < 0. 001) in all <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels.</b> Changes were most prominent in the smallest microvessels. Conclusions. Sublingual microvascular perfusion is reduced by UF and can be restored temporarily using autotransfusion by TP due to increased venous return. SDF imaging is able to detect these volume changes. SDF imaging and TP could become a useful bedside toot to evaluate the patient's (microvascular) volume status and response to therapy in dialysis or intradialytic hypotensio...|$|R

40|$|A <b>category</b> <b>of</b> small <b>vessels</b> {{fashioned}} in samian ware has conventionally {{been interpreted}} as representing inkwells. This identification seems valid given their typological characteristics. The type is fairly rare in Roman Britain, {{as in other}} western provinces. Nonetheless, {{it is well known}} through illustration and is sufficiently frequent to be familiar to those who study the period. Given the likely close form-function relationship of this type, its distribution is assessed in this paper as an archaeological index of the locations of writing and recording in Britannia using ink. Indeed, study of samian inkwells offers a seemingly reliable indicator of such activity. This prospect is almost unique given the rarity of other types of direct and indirect evidence for writing in ink from Roman Britain. Analysis shows, for the first time, that there is a clear pattern to the occurrence of samian inkwells. Most examples come from sites associated with the Roman military, with a sizeable proportion also recorded from major civil centres; elsewhere they are particularly infrequent. Examination of the spatial occurrence of these finds from within sites reveals a notable pattern. Many come from contexts at or close-by to locations where writing in ink might be expected.

We do not intend to constitute a compendium of jurisprudence or a compendium of statistics; We strive to point out to you all that seems likely to have an impact on your industry, anything that threatens your general interests, anything that is of a nature to serve them. The information service and a legal section both were frequently consulted by the shipowners.With his considerable intellectual authority, de Rousiers was an effective defender of the interests of the shipowners and contributed to dscussions on legislative project. At times he was criticized for being too effective in his lobbying.During World War I (1914-18) there was an enforced truce between the shipowners and the labor unions, with the state as mediator.As soon as the Armistice was declared the shipowners, led by the Committee, reasserted their independence in negotiating wages.De Rousiers justified this position, Conditions vary according to the region; Working conditions vary according to traffic and <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels.</b> Remuneration also depends on the possibilities of each company. How could it be conceived that, in the midst of a crisis, a professional trade union would be forced, by submitting to such an arbitration procedure, to impose new burdens on all its members which might exceed the limit of what some can bear?

The expression patterns of various markers of endothelial and pericytic differentiation were correlated with the position of the cells in the vessels and the expression of colligin 2. We found that colligin 2 is expressed in all <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> glioma blood <b>vessels</b> in cells with endothelial and pericytic lineage. Expression of colligin 2 was also found in cells scattered around blood vessels and in few glial fibrillary acidic proteinpositive cells within the blood vessels. There is overlap in the expression of colligin 2 and the collagens type I and IV for which colligin 2 is a chaperon. We conclude that colligin 2 is expressed in all cellular components <b>of</b> glioma blood <b>vessels</b> and may serve as a general marker for active angiogenesis. doi: 10. 1111 /j. 1750 - 3639. 2008. 00248. ...|$|R
