40|$|Abstract — Frequency-domain {{filtered}} {{single carrier}} (SC) -FDMA signal has properties of reduced peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and increased frequency diversity gain. However, if the <b>carrier-frequency</b> <b>separation</b> is {{kept the same}} {{as in the case of}} the transmit filter roll-off factor �� 0, the adjacent users ’ signal spectra overlap and the multi-user interference (MUI) is produced. In our previous work, we proposed an iterative joint single-user minimum mean square error frequency-domain equalization/successive MUI cancellation (called iterative joint MMSE-FDE/SMUIC), which performs iteratively a series of MMSE-FDE, spectrum combining, and SMUIC, for frequency-domain filtered SC-FDMA uplink. However, the residual ISI and MUI limit the BER performance improvement. In this paper, we replace the single-user MMSE-FDE by an MMSE spatial filtering (MMSE-SF) and propose an iterative joint multi-user MMSE-SF/SMUIC (called iterative joint MMSE-SF/SMUIC). The achievable bit error rate (BER) and throughput performances are evaluated by computer simulation.

40|$|Abstract—For {{high-speed}} packet access, hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiplexing are indispensable techniques. As the multiple-access technique, {{single carrier}} (SC) -frequency-division multiple-access (FDMA) using transmit filtering is promising. The use of squareroot Nyquist transmit filter reduces peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the transmit SC-FDMA signal {{and increases the}} frequency diversity gain. However, if the <b>carrier-frequency</b> <b>separation</b> among multiple-access users is kept {{the same as in}} the case of the transmit filter’s roll-off factor α= 0 (i. e., brick wall filter), the adjacent users ’ signal spectra overlap and the multi-user interference (MUI) is produced. In this paper, we propose an iterative minimum mean square error signal detection and interference cancellation (MMSED-IC) for turbo coded uplink SC-FDMA MIMO using HARQ. In the proposed MMSED-IC, not only the inter-antenna interference (IAI) and residual inter-symbol interference (ISI) but also MUI are cancelled in an iterative fashion. We evaluate the HARQ throughput performances by computer simulation, and show that the use of roll-off factor α= 1 achieves the highest throughput performance...|$|E
