50|$|Swordfish {{surfaced}} successfully. However, {{during the}} up-angle the freshwater drain <b>collecting</b> <b>tank</b> vents were submerged and sucked contaminated {{water into the}} feed system. The steam generator water could not be analyzed immediately because nucleonics laboratory in the stern room had been inundated by the wave of bilgewater. After a while, the leading ELT found the necessary reagents and analyzed samples from both steam generators on the top hat in reactor compartment upper level. By this time the boat was in direct communication with Naval Reactors, which ordered the reactor shut down and cooled down and steam generators drained and refilled. The emergency diesel generator, located in engineroom lower level, initially had water in the generator from the incident but it was drained and the diesel was online before the reactor was shut down. The reactor was cooled down and steam generators were blown down with service air and refilled until all fresh water on the boat was exhausted, which {{was a couple of}} hours before arriving back in Pearl Harbor. Subsequent analysis of steam generator water revealed no leakage of reactor coolant into the steam generators.|$|E

40|$|For direct {{measuring}} of {{the maximum}} gas outlet cooling temperature in the flowing core of the pebble-bed reactor AVR Juelich there were used flattened graphite spheres (moderator spheres). These spheres, also called gas temperature measuring elements, contained 34 or 68 thin wires of different metals and metalalloys,which melt reaching their melting point. The wires itselves were in little Al$_{ 2 }$O$_{ 3 }$ or graphite melting pots or they were melted in quartz ampules. Melting pots and ampules were admitted in a holder. The gas temperature measuring element was supplied with cooling Channels for a better cooling gas flow through the sphere. For {{the determination of the}} hold-up time of the balls in the core and and for the estimation of their way through the core the spheres were caught in a special <b>collecting</b> <b>tank</b> with a spiral chute and a counter. At the same time the behaviour of quartz under high radiation dose and under high temperatures wasinvestigated. To save time and money a new radiographic method of post-investigation was developed.

40|$|Successions of long gas {{bubbles and}} liquid slugs form the {{so-called}} slug flow pattern in a gas-liquid flow. A unit cell encompassing one gas bubble and one liquid slug characterizes this alternating gas-liquid flow. The kinematic and dynamic flow mechanisms {{responsible for the}} interactions between the successive unit cells are still an open question. Inside this context, this work addresses specifically to the bubble velocity, the bubble to bubble interactions and the entrance mechanisms. Within an experimental framework the spatial evolution of each unit cell structure is individualized during the acquisition period. The experimental apparatus consisted of a 23. 4 m long transparent Plexiglas pipe, 26 mm ID, which means a total relative length of 900 free diameters. The air and water were mixed at the inlet of the test section and discharged into a <b>collecting</b> <b>tank</b> open to the atmosphere. The instantaneous measurements of the flow structure were made with double-wire conductive probes. The probes were installed in four measuring stations; each station had two probes slightly apart. The measuring stations were located at 127 D, 273 D, 506 D e 777 D from the mixer.

40|$|Sedimentation as {{a result}} of runoff is the {{principal}} human-caused threat to the environment in general and to water quality in particular on the Pacific island of Guam. Runoff takes the form of flash floods of high velocity but short duration. The rapid flow is attributed to low soil infiltration, a high proportion of rain converted to overland flow, and scanty or absent vegetation cover due to wildfires. In the areas where protective vegetation cover is lowest, the soil is subjected to high shearing forces by such overland flow. Erosion damage is a serious problem to the environmental ecosystem of the island. Sediment lost to erosion clogs rivers, lakes, and waterways. Erosion and sedimentation loss are also a major source of water-quality problems in Guam. Sedimentation provides a vehicle for the transport of agricultural chemical residues into canals, streams, rivers, and eventually near-shore ecosystems, where it damages coral reefs. The objective of the project reported here was to assess the sediment-loading rate to the near-shore coral reef originating from the upland watershed. The effectiveness of Vetiver grass as a sediment trap and its effect on quality of the water leaving the upland watershed were evaluated. Four plots (each 72 5. 5 ft.) were laid out on a uniformly sloped (12 %) watershed for estimation of sedimentation rates. Each plot was equipped with an 8 -inch-high flume wall that separated its surface from those of the other plots and their surroundings. Flumes were equipped with cone-shaped weirs that directed the runoff and sediments into a <b>collecting</b> <b>tank</b> beneath the weirs...|$|E

40|$|Dissemination {{protocols}} {{in a large}} {{sensor network}} typically take a data-centric paradigm in which the communication primitives are organized around the sensing data instead of the network nodes. A user expresses his interest in a given data type by specifying a query message, which then propagates through the network. When detecting a nearby stimulus that matches the query type, sensors generate data reports which traverse the network to reach the interested user. The large scale of a sensor network, the resource constraints of each node in terms of energy, computation and memory, and potentially frequent node failures all present formidable challenges to reliable data dissemination. The protocols must be energy efficient, robust against failures and channel dynamics, {{and be able to}} scale to large networks. In this chapter, we provide a brief overview and critique of the state-of-art dissemination protocols and discuss future research directions. In this chapter, we focus on the design of data dissemination protocols for a large-scale sensor network. In such networks data flows from potentially multiple sources to potentially multiple, static or mobile sinks. We define a data source as a sensor node that detects a stimulus, which is a target or an event of interest, and generates data to report the event. A sink is defined as a user that collects data reports from the sensor network. In the example of battlefield surveillance, a group of soldiers, each of them serves as a sink, may be interested in <b>collecting</b> <b>tank</b> location information from a sensor network deployed in the battlefield. The sensor nodes surrounding a tank, which acts as a stimulus, detect it and generate data reports. These reports will be forwarded by intermediate sensors to each of the sinks...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the fate of the conjugated forms of the three most common natural estrogens in the municipal aqueous environment. Levels of conjugated and free estrogens in (1) female urine; (2) a septic tank collecting domestic wastewater; (3) influents and effluents of six activated sludge sewage treatment plants (STPs) were measured. The analytical method was based on solid-phase extraction by using a Carbograph 4 cartridge and Liquid Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectrometry. On average, a group of 73 women selected to represent a typical cross section of the female inhabitants of a Roman condominium, excreted 106, 14 and 32 mug/day of conjugated estriol (E- 3) estradiol (E- 2) and estrone (E- 1), respectively. Apart from some E- 3 in pregnancy urine, free estrogens were never detected in urine samples. Estrogen sulfates represented 21 % of the total conjugated estrogens. This situation changed markedly in the condominium <b>collecting</b> <b>tank.</b> Here, significant amounts of free estrogens were observed and the estrogen sulfate to estrogen glucuronated ratio rose to 55 / 45. A laboratory biodegradation test confirmed that glucuronated estrogens are readily deconjugated in unmodified domestic wastewater, presumably due to the large amounts of the beta-glucuronidase enzyme produced by fecal bacteria (Escherichia coli). Deconjugation continued in sewer transit. At the STP entrance, free estrogens and sulfated estrogens were the dominant species. The sewage treatment completely removed residues of estrogen glucuronates and with good efficiency (84 - 97 %) the other analytes, but not E- 1 (61 %) and estrone- 3 -sulfate (E- 1 - 3 S) (64 %). Considering that (1) E- 1 has half the estrogenic potency of E- 2, (2) the amount of the former species discharged from STPs into the receiving water was more than ten times larger than the latter one and (3) a certain fraction of E- 1 - 3 S could be converted to E- 1 in the aquatic environment, E- 1 appears to be the most important natural endocrine disrupter.

40|$|The {{automotive}} {{cooling system}} is {{a significant part of}} the car that removes the engine generated heat outside across the radiator. The increasing demand of nanofluids for industrial applications has led many researchers to focus on the subject in the last decade. The limited thermophysical properties and heat transfer fo liquids across the car radiator have resulted in much research to find better coolant fluids. Space constraints are another key issue in the evofofotua applications to remove heat from high heat flux generating surfaces of automobile engines. In order to improve thermophysical properties of the coolant fluid to enhance heat transfer in the automotive cooling system, nanofluids have been utilized as a coolant. This study aims to enhance heat transfer with a slight pressure drop in the automotive cooling system by using multi types of nanoparticles dispersed in various types of basefluids. The appropriate type of nanofluids and the influence of different nanofluids on the heat transfer performance for the car cooling system have been identified. The radiator performance efficiency to reduce the radiator size and weight has been studied. The friction factor and heat transfer enhancement using different types of nanofluids are studied. The TiO 2 and SiO 2 nanopowders suspended in four different base fluids (pure water, EG, 10 %EG+ 90 %W and 20 %EG+ 80 %W) are prepared experimentally. The thermophysical properties of both nanofluids and base fluids have been measured and validated with the standard and the experimental data available. The experimental test rig setup included a car radiator, <b>collecting</b> <b>tank,</b> pump, rotameter, valves and plastic tubes. The evaluation of the friction factor and heat transfer coefficient by taking readings of the temperature and pressure drop under laminar flow condition were conducted. The volume flowrate was found to be in the range of (1 - 5 LPM) for pure water and (3 - 12 LPM) for other base fluids; while, the inlet temperature and nanofluid volume fraction were in the range of (60 - 80 oC) and (1 - 4 %) respectively. The CFD analysis for the nanofluids flow inside the flat tube of a car radiator under laminar flow was carried out. A simulation study was conducted by using the finite volume oaotfm to solve the continuity, momentum, and energy equations. The geometry meshing of problem with a description of the boundary conditions was performed by using commercial software to determine the friction factor and heat transfer coefficient. The experimental results showed the friction factor decreased with the increase of the volume flowrate and increased with the increase of nanofluid volume fraction but slightly decreased with the increase of the inlet temperature. The simulation results showed good agreement with the experimental data with deviation not exceeding 4 %. The experimental results showed the heat transfer coefficient increased with the increase of the volume flowrate, the nanofluid volume fraction and the inlet temperature. The simulation results showed good agreement with the experimental data with deviation not exceeding 6 %. In addition, the SiO 2 nanofluid showed higher values of the friction factor and heat transfer coefficient than TiO 2 nanofluid. The base fluid (20 %EG+ 80 %W) gave higher values of the heat transfer coefficient and proper values of friction factor compared to other base fluids. The 4 % of SiO 2 nanoparticles suspended in (20 %EG+ 80 %W) base fluid was significant augmentation of heat transfer in the automobile radiator. The regression equations among input (Reynolds number, Prandtl number, and nanofluid volume fraction) and response (friction factor and Nusselt number) were found to be correlated. The experimental results were compared with the experimental data available and there were good agreements with a maximum deviation of approximately 5...|$|E
