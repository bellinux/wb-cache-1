40|$|Cold-formed steel hollow flange {{sections}} are structurally efficient {{compared to}} the conventional open <b>channel</b> <b>sections.</b> They can be of different forms including hollow flange I- and <b>channel</b> <b>sections,</b> which are generally fabricated by first cold-forming a single sheet to form the desired shape and then connecting their flange and web elements by continuous welding. Instead of welding, intermittently screw/rivet fastened or spot welded connection can also be used. A detailed investigation is currently under way on the structural performance characteristics of such intermittently screw/rivet fastened steel hollow flange sections. This paper presents the details of an experimental study performed to investigate the behaviour of built-up cold-formed steel hollow flange sections in compression, where more than 45 stub columns were tested. Both hollow flange I- and <b>channel</b> <b>sections</b> built-up using either single steel sheet or three steel elements were tested. Tests also included built-up hollow flange <b>channel</b> <b>sections</b> with stiffened web elements. Test results including the failure loads, load versus axial deformation plots and failure characteristics are presented in this paper. Test failure loads are compared with the predictions based on both effective width and direct strength methods to verify their adequacy in predicting the section compression capacity of built-up hollow flange sections. This paper has shown that although hollow flange I-sections made of three elements with a 100 mm fastener spacing can perform similar to continuously welded <b>sections,</b> hollow flange <b>channel</b> <b>sections</b> undergo premature failures even with a 50 mm fastener spacing, and the reasons are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Sidewall curl {{is a type}} of {{springback}} deformation {{resulting from}} successive bending-unbending when a sheet metal is drawn over a die radius or through a drawbead. In this study, the sidewall curl in stamped AHSS parts (TRIP 780 and DP 980) was predicted using four models from LS-DYNA material library: 24, 36, 37, 125 and a UMAT in ABAQUS based on the Yoshida-Uemori model. Various material characterization tests were analyzed to identify the input parameters. Plane-strain <b>channel</b> <b>sections</b> were drawn in a specialized die with adjustable drawbeads and various die entry radii and compared with simulation results. By increasing drawbead penetration, the springback angle decreased but the sidewall curl increased in the <b>channel</b> <b>sections.</b> For simulations in LS-DYNA, MAT 37 with increased integration points predicted the most accurate results. The YU model in ABAQUS showed less than 8 % error compared to the predicted sidewall curl for <b>channel</b> <b>sections</b> with shallow drawbeads...|$|R

50|$|It is the {{practice}} in the steel industry that structural shapes are assigned representative designations for convenient shorthand description on drawings and documentation: <b>Channel</b> <b>sections,</b> with or without flange stiffeners, are usually referenced as C shapes; <b>Channel</b> <b>sections</b> without flange stiffeners are also referenced as U shapes; Point symmetric sections that are shaped similar to the letter Z are referenced as Z shapes. Section designations can be regional and even specific to a manufacturer. In steel building construction, secondary members such as purlins (roof) and girts (wall) are frequently cold-formed steel C, Z or U sections, (or mill rolled) C sections.|$|R
40|$|The lateral {{torsional}} buckling behaviour of hot rolled <b>channel</b> <b>sections</b> subjected to bending is studied in an overall project. The final {{objective of this}} project {{is to develop a}} design method. This paper concentrates on the validation of the FEM model against the experiments. For <b>channel</b> <b>sections</b> loaded through the shear centre (centric loading) sudden collapse was observed while <b>channel</b> <b>sections</b> loaded in the plane of the web (eccentric loading) fail gradually in bending and torsion. The objective of the numerical research was to simulate this experimental behaviour and to predict the failure load correctly. Therefore, a FEM model was made consisting of shell elements and beam elements to compensate for the root radius of the channels, including plastic material behaviour, geometric non-linearity and measured imperfections. The simulations gave agreeable failure loads. For eccentric loading, the FEM simulations showed load-displacement curves, which compare well with experimental results. For centric loading however, the results appeared to be largely sensitive to imperfections with respect to member straightness. Finally, it is concluded that the FEM model is successfully validated against the available test results. ...|$|R

This paper performs a study to simulate the flow field in the proposed Dubai artificial channel using a 2 D hydrodynamic model. The model predicts the flow depth and velocity in the channel, lagoons and bends. The model predictions show that the velocity is higher in the <b>channel</b> <b>sections</b> compared to the lagoons and bends sections. On the other hand, the water depth is lower in the <b>channel</b> <b>sections</b> compared to the lagoons and bends sections. Nonetheless, the velocities in the channel are within the accepted range that prevents boundary erosion and sediment deposition...|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} aspects {{relating}} to the proper construction of a bullbar. It is widely accepted that the <b>channel</b> <b>section</b> which provides the strength for the protection system must be constructed from one piece of material and free from sections bolted on or welded together. The thickness of the material is something which should be considered when choosing a bullbar, generally the thicker the material, the stronger the product delivering greater protection. The grade of material is also important, products manufactured from steel or hi-tensile/structural grade alloys are stronger than a standard alloy or polymer products.|$|E

40|$|Bearing {{failure is}} a form of {{localized}} failure that occurs when thin-walled cold-formed steel sections are subjected to concentrated loads or support reactions. To determine the bearing capacity of cold-formed <b>channel</b> <b>sections,</b> a unified design equation with different bearing coefficients is given in the current North American specification AISI S 100 and the Australian/New Zealand standard AS/NZS 4600. However, coefficients are not available for unlipped <b>channel</b> <b>sections</b> that are normally fastened to supports through their flanges. Eurocode 3 Part 1. 3 includes bearing capacity equations for different load cases, but does not distinguish between fastened and unfastened support conditions. Therefore, an experimental study was conducted to determine the bearing capacities of these sections as used in floor systems. Twenty-eight web bearing tests on unlipped <b>channel</b> <b>sections</b> with restrained flanges were conducted under End One Flange (EOF) and Interior One Flange (IOF) load cases. Using the results from this study, a new equation was proposed within the AISI S 100 and AS/NZS 4600 guidelines to determine the bearing capacities of cold-formed unlipped channels with flanges fastened to supports. A new design rule was also proposed based on the direct strength method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The general {{problem of}} solving for normal flow dcplh in open-chan nel flow has a {{complication}} in that {{some types of}} <b>channel</b> cross <b>sections</b> do not always have a unique solution.

A computer program for quickly and accurately finding the unique solution, using the Chezy or Manning flow resistance equations, is available. Test runs for a rectangular, a triangular, a trapezoidal, and two complex <b>channel</b> cross <b>sections</b> are {{used to evaluate the}} effectiveness of the procedure.

50|$|A <b>channel</b> <b>section</b> is {{considered}} to be most economical or most efficient when it passes a maximum discharge for given cross section area,resistance cofficient and bottom slope. From the equation of continuity it is evident that for area of cross section being constant,discharge is maximum when the velocity of discharge is maximum.and from Chézy formula and Manning formula for a certain value of slope and surface roughness velocity is maximum when the hydraulic radius is maximum.and if we take area as constant hydraulic radius is maximum if the wetted perimeter is minimum.semicircular section is the best economical channel but due to difficulty in creating it, trapezoidal can be considered most efficient.|$|E

However steel sleepers seem not to have enjoyed widespread adoption until about 1995. Their dominant usage now is for life extension of existing track on secondary routes. They have a significant advantage on weak formations and poor ballast conditions, as the bearing area is at a high level, immediately under the rail seat.|$|E
