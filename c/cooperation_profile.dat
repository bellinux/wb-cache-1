In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} model of self-interested agents acting in an open environment, which captures the most {{relevant}} elements of agents ’ behaviour related to negotiation with other agents. The agent behaviour is mainly motivated by the gain they may obtain while fulfilling their goals and negotiating. Sometimes, the agents are also motivated by the necessity to cooperate with other agents for achieving their goals. The key element in the agent behaviour is their capability to develop a set of negotiation profiles: the preference profile, the partner <b>cooperation</b> <b>profile</b> and the group-of-partners negotiation profile; these profiles help the agents to conduct their negotiation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} automatic negotiation agents in an open environment. Agents are motivated by the gain they may obtain while fulfilling their goals, but their behaviour can change during negotiation according to previous interactions with other agents in the system. Changing behaviour may refer to either the use of different negotiation strategies or to concessions made for other agents, with which they have successfully negotiated in the past. To this aim, an agent develops a set of partners’ profiles during negotiation: the preference profile, the <b>cooperation</b> <b>profile,</b> and the group negotiation profile. The first two profiles characterize individuals, while in a group negotiation profile, several agent profiles are clustered according to commonly discovered features. Different approaches {{to the development of}} these profiles are presented. </p...|$|E
40|$|In a {{multi-agent system}} with self-interested agents, {{cooperation}} {{has to be}} achieved though communication and negotiation. The paper presents a model and associated behavior of self-interested agents that are endowed, besides the widely accepted beliefs-desires-intentions notions, with goals, preferences, obligations, and norms. The behavior of the agents is mainly motivated by the gain they may obtain while fulfilling their preferred goals and by the necessity to cooperate with other agents for achieving these goals. The inference rules that guide negotiation are based both on cost and gain, and on the <b>cooperation</b> <b>profile</b> the agent develops during previous interactions with other agents in the system. The model permits the definition of several types of agents by varying their behavior according to obligation compliance, self-interestedness, desire to develop good cooperation relations with other agents in the system or simply desire to obtain the maximum gain.

40|$|When {{a country}} is sanctioned for violating {{international}} rules today, {{it is usually}} targeted by several different entities. The degree to which sanctions by different senders overlap remains a largely unexplored phenomenon. In this paper, we examine the extent of sanctions cooperation, i. e. joint action among major sanctions senders (the US, the EU, and regional organizations) against identical targets. We then map regional patterns and evaluate one potential explanation for them. Our analysis leads to three major findings. First, sanctions overlap is predominant and has consistently increased {{over the last three}} decades. Twothirds of sanctions involve more than a single sender. Targets today are usually subject to punishment by at least three different sanctions senders (up from one in 1980) and sometimes up to six different senders. Second, world regions vary widely in the extent of sanctions <b>cooperation,</b> the <b>profile</b> of sanctions senders, and their interactions. Third, to explain variation in sanctions cooperation, we find that hegemonic stability theory does not provide much leverage. We conclude by outlining avenues for future research on sanctions cooperation relating to sanctions onset and effectiveness...|$|R

The paper starts with an overview of what is known about effective partnerships and elaborates a conceptual framework for Knowledge Building partnerships based on a review of literature and two case studies of school-university-government partnerships. In one case, a Ministry of Education wanted to bring more vitality into schools of small remote villages, and in the other case another Ministry of Education wanted to renew its school-based international <b>cooperation</b> <b>profile.</b> Emerging from this work is a three-component model for going to scale with Knowledge Building partnerships: Knowledge Building as a shared vision; symmetric knowledge advancement; and multi-level, research-based innovation. Characteristics of, and conditions for, effective partnerships for Knowledge Building are elaborated, and an emerging model is developed to help communities establish effective partnerships and contribute to this evolving model...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of traffic information {{is important in}} many applications in relation to Intelligent Transport systems (ITS), since it reduces the uncertainty of future traffic states and improves traffic mobility. There {{is a lot of}} research done in the field of traffic information predictions such as speed, flow and travel time. The most important research was done in the domain of cooperative intelligent transport system (C-ITS). The goal {{of this paper is to}} introduce the novel cooperation behaviour profile prediction through the example of flexible Road Trains useful road cooperation parameter, which contributes to the improvement of traffic mobility in Intelligent Transportation Systems. This paper presents an approach towards the control and cooperation behaviour modelling of vehicles in the flexible Road Train based on hybrid automaton and neuro-fuzzy (ANFIS) {{prediction of}} <b>cooperation</b> <b>profile</b> of the flexible Road Train. Hybrid automaton takes into account complex dynamics of each vehicle as well as discrete cooperation approach. The ANFIS is a particular class of the ANN family with attractive estimation and learning potentials. In order to provide statistical analysis, RMSE (root mean square error), coefficient of determination (R 2) and Pearson coefficient (r), were utilized. The study results suggest that ANFIS would be an efficient soft computing methodology, which could offer precise predictions of cooperative interactions between vehicles in Road Train, which is useful for prediction mobility in Intelligent Transport systems...|$|E
40|$|Cooperation through {{international}} organizations {{is fundamental to}} the international legal order. International organizations are nowadays ubiquitous and come in many different manifestations, each allowing for different levels of international <b>cooperation.</b> The <b>profile</b> of regional and universal organizations may vary greatly from one organization to another. At the same time, they do not live apart and {{this has led to}} the creation of a complex network of relationships. These relationships have seldom been the object of scholarship, and this book seeks to address that gap. In general, the relationships between {{international organizations}} can give rise to such issues as the conditions placed upon one organization by another, demarcations of competence, membership of other organizations, and various forms of collaboration involving the conclusion of agreements between organizations. Optimal coexistence, cooperation and coherence all play a role in optimizing the relations between international organizations. The volume concludes by analysing current challenges, including those of legal identity, responsibility and accountability, as well as making proposals for reform, such as through the development of a common law between organizations...|$|R

She is on the live recording of the Vienna State Opera's production of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde for Deutsche Grammophon (2003). In a 2001 interview with Associated Press, however, Voigt expressed that she was unlucky with recording because of unexpected cancellations and postponements. The opportunities of <b>cooperation</b> with high <b>profile</b> musicians could have made her a major prima donna more quickly. She had a chance to work with Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti in a televised production of Verdi's La forza del destino in 1997. However, the performance did not take place since Pavarotti had not learned the role of Alvaro and another opera was substituted. Later the same year, Voigt was cast to sing for a new recording of Tristan und Isolde under the direction of Sir Georg Solti. Before it proceeded, Solti suddenly died of a heart attack.|$|R
40|$|Background: This article {{presents}} {{a new direction}} of good clinical practice, Clinical Pharmacist Report at the Psychiatric Hospital Idrija. This is a written document intended for a physician (psychiatrist or specialist in internal medicine). By {{the help of the}} Report, doctor can make a correct decision about the use of drugs and choice of examinations. It is described in detail when and how the Report can be prepared. Conclusion: Clinical practice has shown that the need for Clinical Pharmacist Reports at the Psychiatric Hospital Idrija exceeds the available personnel capacities, but nevertheless, clinical pharmacist should at least be involved in the treatment of patients taking eight or more medicines. Clinical pharmacist report in the Psychiatric Hospital Idrija is an example of constructive <b>cooperation</b> of different <b>profiles</b> in health profession. It represents an added value in the treatment of psychiatric patients and should be upgraded, because a patient in the hospital environment has practically no chance to consult a pharmacist. A doctor that decides to prescribe medicines contrary to Clinical Pharmacist Report should substantiate and document his decision...|$|R
40|$|Level:                           Master thesis in Business {{administration}} with concentration towards Ecological economics   Title:             Combating climate change – {{a case study}} of Statoil’s climate strategy   Problem:       The world is facing an environmental situation where we no longer can ignore problems like climate change, losses of species and an overall environmental degradation. Many actors have to take their responsibility and do {{as much as they can}} for a sustainable development. One crucial actor is the business world. Often, they both have the knowledge and financial power to make a difference. Higher environmental regulations and pressure from stakeholders, such as the Swedish government or the EU, forces companies to consider the environment while doing business. This requires a strategy.   Purpose:       The purpose with the essay is to identify and study Statoil’s climate strategy.  We also want to identify the most important internal and external factors that are affecting the strategy.   Method:       The thesis is based on a qualitative method made up by two parts, interviews and literature studies. We made one informant interview and two respondent interviews with two environmental executives from Statoil AB.   Results:        Statoil has a mainly pro-active strategy and are very ambiguous in the climate question, although their strategy is highly affected by the surrounding. Developing new technologies, <b>cooperation</b> and <b>profiling</b> are the main parts of their strategy. They are affected by the dominating discourse ecological modernization, as well as by the organizational field. They are in turn affecting the field by their offensive strategy. The customers and the legal framework are the most important external factors of impact. Whereas the corporate group StatoilHydro and financial resources are the most important internal factors.   Keywords:    Climate strategy, environmental strategy, responsible company, greening, ecological modernization...|$|R
40|$|The {{popularity}} of the Internet has dramatically increased the diversity of clients and applications that access data across wide area networks and mobile environments. Data delivery in these environments presents several challenges. First, applications often have diverse requirements {{with respect to the}} latency of their requests and recency of data. Traditional data delivery architectures do not provide interfaces to express these requirements. Second, it is difficult to accurately estimate when objects are updated. Existing solutions either require servers to notify clients (push-based), which adds overhead at servers and may not scale, or require clients to contact servers (pull-based), which rely on estimates that are often inaccurate in practice. Third, cache managers need a flexible and scalable way to determine if an object in the cache meets a client's latency and recency preferences. Finally, mobile clients who access data on wireless networks share limited wireless bandwidth and typically have different QoS requirements for different applications. In this dissertation we address these challenges using two complementary techniques, client <b>profiles</b> and server <b>cooperation.</b> Client <b>profiles</b> are a set of parameters that enable clients to communicate application-specific latency and recency preferences to caches and wireless base stations. Profiles are used by cache managers to determine whether to deliver a cached object to the client or to validate the object at a remote server, and for scheduling data delivery to mobile clients. Server cooperation enables servers to provide resource information to cache managers, which enables cache managers to estimate the recency of cached objects. The main contributions of this dissertation are as follows: First, we present a flexible and scalable architecture to support client profiles that is straightforward to implement at a cache. wireless base station. Second, we present techniques to improve estimates of the recency of cached objects using server cooperation by increasing the amount of information servers provide to caches. Third, for mobile clients, we present a framework for incorporating profiles into the cache utilization, downloading, and scheduling decisions at a We evaluate client <b>profiles</b> and server <b>cooperation</b> using synthetic and trace data. Finally, we present an implementation of profiles and experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Das vorliegende Papier befaßt sich mit einer transnationalen Unternehmenskooperation. Rekonstruiert wird das Entwicklungsprofil der Kooperation der beiden Automobilhersteller Skoda und Volkswagen, das durch das Ineinandergreifen der beiden aktuellen Tendenzen von Transformation und Globalisierung geprägt ist. Als für den Kooperationserfolg entscheidend zeigte sich nicht nur der von Volkswagen geleistete beträchtliche Know-how- und Managementtransfer an den tschechischen Standort, sondern auch die Art und Weise im Vorgehen. Vor allem das Anschließen an die bestehenden betrieblichen Kompetenzpotentiale erwies sich dabei als Faktor, der der Kooperation die notwendige Tragfähigkeit für den anstehenden großen Lernschritt ermöglicht hat. Die Studie diskutiert die Befunde auf drei Ebenen der Integration: der betrieblichen, der regionalen und der internationalen. Gegenüber der überaus gelungenen internationalen Integration zeigt sich die regionale Integration des Unternehmens als erheblich zurückgeblieben. Mit Blick auf dieses Problem kommen die Autorinnen zu dem Schluß, daß die eingetretene Diskrepanz kein unerwartbares Ergebnis darstellt angesichts der ungleichen Ausstattungen von internationalen Unternehmen und lokaler Industrie und auch nicht vorrangig - wie es sog. Global Player-Strategien vielfach zugeschrieben wird - aus der Tendenz zur Außenorientierung auf das Konzernnetzwerk zu erklären ist. Vielmehr hat sich am Fall gezeigt, daß die begrenzte regionale Integration ganz wesentlich auch ein Ergebnis der Politik ist, die die tschechische Regierung in den wichtigen Anfangsjahren der Transformation verfolgte und die die erforderliche autochthone Restrukturierungsleistung nicht hervorgebracht hat. " (Autorenreferat) "This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a transnational business <b>cooperation.</b> A <b>profile</b> of the development in cooperation is reconstructed, which is shaped by interlocking tendencies of globalisation and transformation. In this regard, the study {{is part of a}} larger, more encompassing study of industrial renewal in Eastern Europe, set into motion partially as a result of foreign direct investment from large multinational corporations. The main item of interest {{is one of the most}} prominent east-west corporation projects in the transformation countries: the cooperation between the Czech automotive manufacturer Skoda and the German Volkswagen Group. On the basis of numerous samples collected over several years, the central conflicts and strategic turning points in the relationship are examined. The collection of data involves a multilevel analysis - from strategic political to the operative production and management levels - reconstructing the various viewpoints of cooperation partners. Decisive for success provided to be not only Volkswagenżs substantial transfer of expertise and management to locations in the Czech Republic, but moreover the manner in which this was performed. Above all, utilization of the existing pool of competency proved to be the factor, which provided stability required for the learning process. Results of the study are discussed with special attention to international and regional integration of transnational corporations. In the case of Skoda, an especially positive development is demonstrated, regarding modernisation, the level of competitiveness, and the competence structure. Entry into western markets on a large scale was successfully achieved. In comparison to this international integration, regional integration remained largely underdeveloped. In looking at this problem, the authors come to the conclusion that the incurred discrepancy was not unexpected, considering the unequal assets of international corporations and local domestic industry. This discrepancy - found in the results - was not caused by the trend of multinationals to orient themselves outwardly (on their own international production network) as often attributed to the so-called global playersż strategies. Rather, this case demonstrated that limited regional integration is in large part a result of policies, pursued by the Czech government during the important early transformation years and which failed to result in the necessary national reconstruction effects.
