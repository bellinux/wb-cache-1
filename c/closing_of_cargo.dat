50|$|The port of Bilbao is a {{first-class}} commercial port and {{is among the}} top five of Spain. Over 200 regular maritime services link Bilbao with 500 ports worldwide. At the <b>close</b> <b>of</b> 2009 <b>cargo</b> movements amounted to 31.6 million tonnes, Russia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries being the main markets. In the first semester of 2008, it received over 67,000 passengers and 2,770 ships. This activity reported 419 million euros to the basque GDP and generates almost 10,000 jobs.|$|R

5000|$|FFAG accelerators have {{potential}} medical applications in proton therapy for cancer, as proton sources for high intensity neutron production, for non-invasive security inspections <b>of</b> <b>closed</b> <b>cargo</b> containers, for the rapid acceleration of muons to high energies {{before they have}} time to decay, and as [...] "energy amplifiers", for Accelerator-Driven Sub-critical Reactors (ADSRs) / Sub-critical Reactors in which a neutron beam derived from a FFAG drives a slightly sub-critical fission reactor. Such ADSRs would be inherently safe, having no danger of accidental exponential runaway, and relatively little production of transuranium waste, with its long life and potential for nuclear weapons proliferation.|$|R

40|$|The article {{gives an}} account of the results of working out a {{generalized}} dynamic model <b>of</b> fixation <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> with pads jointly with flexible and thrust elements. Working out a generalized dynamic model <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> fixation is rather a complicated problem not in the sense of solving differential equations systems but in the sense of presenting them as a complex mechanical system “cargo – pads – flexible elements – thrust bars”. Generalized dynamic model <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> with pads observed that this model represents technology of joint work of flexible and thrust fastening means <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> on rolling stock. In particular, {{on the basis of this}} model there can be obtained the technology models of joint work of flexible and elastic fastening means <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> without pads <b>of</b> fastening flexible elements <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> with pads without thrust bars and also flexible fastening elements <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> without pads and thrust bars at asymmetrical and/or symmetrical allocation <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> in the wagon.
