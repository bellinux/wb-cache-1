50|$|Short INterspersed Elements {{are short}} DNA {{sequences}} (<500 bases) that represent reverse-transcribed RNA molecules originally transcribed by RNA polymerase III into transfer RNA, 5S ribosomal RNA, {{and other small}} nuclear RNAs. The mechanism of retrotransposition of these elements {{is more complicated than}} LINEs, and less dependent solely on the actual elements that they encode. SINEs do not encode a functional reverse transcriptase protein and rely on other mobile elements for transposition. In some cases they may have their own endonuclease {{that will allow them to}} cleave their way into the genome, but the majority of SINEs integrate at <b>chromosomal</b> <b>breaks</b> by using random DNA breaks to prime reverse transcriptase.

In 1946, he published its systematic application to the radioactive treatment of functional cancer of the thyroid. This breakthrough was followed by autoradiography techniques and by a Review of Modern Physics report on beta rays. The explosive growth of radiation medicine enlarged his responsibilities as Head of Physics at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Institute.

50|$|The {{possibility}} that BrdU being substituted for thymine in the genomic DNA could induce double stranded <b>chromosomal</b> <b>breaks</b> and specifically resulting in SCEs {{has been previously}} discussed in the literature. Additionally, BrdU incorporation has been suggested to interfere with strand segregation patterns. If this is the case, {{there would be an}} inflation in false positive SCEs which may be annotated. Therefore, many cells should be analyzed using the Strand-seq protocol to ensure that SCEs are in fact present in the population.The number of single cell strands that need to be sequenced in order for an annotation to be accepted has yet to be proposed and is highly dependent on the questions being asked. As Strand-seq is founded on single cell sequencing techniques, one must consider the problems faced with single cell sequencing as well. These include the lacking standards for cell isolation and amplification. Even though previous Strand-seq studies isolated cells using FACS, microfluidics also serves as an attractive alternative. PCR has been shown to produce more erroneous amplification products compared to strand displacement based methods such as MDA and MALBAC. Strand displacement amplification also tends to generate more sequence and longer products which could be beneficial for long read sequencing technologies.|$|E
5000|$|The pathway of HDR has {{not been}} totally elucidated yet (March 2008). However, a number of {{experimental}} results point to the validity of certain models. It is generally accepted that histone H2AX (noted as γH2AX) is phosphorylated within seconds after damage occurs. H2AX is phosphorylated throughout the area surrounding the damage, not only precisely at the break. Therefore, {{it has been suggested}} that γH2AX functions as an adhesive component for attracting proteins to the damaged location. Several research groups have suggested that the phosphorylation of H2AX is done by ATM and ATR in cooperation with MDC1. It has been suggested that before or while H2AX is involved with the repair pathway, the MRN complex (which consists of Mre11, Rad50 and NBS1) is attracted to the broken DNA ends and other MRN complexes to keep the broken ends together. This action by the MRN complex may prevent <b>chromosomal</b> <b>breaks.</b> At some later point the DNA ends are processed so that unnecessary residuals of chemical groups are removed and single strand overhangs are formed. Meanwhile, from the beginning, every piece of single stranded DNA is covered by the protein RPA (Replication Protein A). The function of RPA is likely to keep the single stranded DNA pieces stable until the complementary piece is resynthesized by a polymerase. After this, Rad51 replaces RPA and forms filaments on the DNA strand. Working together with BRCA2 (Breast Cancer Associated), RPA couples a complementary DNA piece which invades the broken DNA strand to form a template for the polymerase. The polymerase is held onto the DNA strand by PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen). PCNA forms typical patterns in the nucleus of the cell through which the current cell cycle can be determined. The polymerase synthesizes the missing part of the broken strand. When the broken strand is rebuilt, both strands need to uncouple again. Multiple ways of [...] "uncoupling" [...] have been suggested, but evidence is not yet sufficient to choose between models (March 2008). After the strands are separated the process is done.The co-localization of Rad51 with the damage indicates that HDR has been initiated instead of NHEJ. In contrast, the presence of a Ku complex (Ku70 and Ku80) indicates that NHEJ has been initiated instead of HDR.HDR and NHEJ repair double strand breaks. Other mechanisms such as NER (Nucleotide Excision Repair), BER (Base Excision Repair) and MMR recognise lesions and replace them via single strand perturbation.|$|E

The pathological diagnosis {{is generally considered}} difficult and prone to mistakes. Since non-random chromosomal translocations are specifically involved in specific entities, their detection is an important adjunct for increasing {{the reliability of the}} diagnosis. Recently, split-signal fluorescence in situ hybridization has become available as a robust method to detect <b>chromosomal</b> <b>breaks</b> in paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed tissues. A bright field approach would bring this technology within the reach of every pathology laboratory. DESIGN AND METHODS: Our study was initiated to determine the consistency between chromogenic in situ hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization, both using split-signal probes developed for the detection of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>breaks.</b> Five hundred and forty cases of 11 lymphoma entities and reactive, benign lymphoid tissues, collected from eight different pathology laboratories, placed on 15 fluorescence in situ hybridization pre-stained tissue microarray slides, were double stained for the chromogenic hybridization. For each core morphology and actual signal were compared to the original fluorescence hybridization results. In addition, hematoxylin background staining intensity and signal intensity of the double-staining chromogenic in situ hybridization procedure were analyzed. RESULTS: With respect to {{the presence or absence of}} <b>chromosomal</b> <b>breaks,</b> 97 % concordance was found between the results of the two techniques.

Disruption of NBS 1 abolished RAD 18 -dependent PCNA ubiquitination and Poleta focus formation, leading to elevated UV sensitivity and mutation. Unexpectedly, the RAD 18 -interacting domain of NBS 1, which was mapped to its C terminus, shares structural and functional similarity with the RAD 18 -interacting domain of RAD 6.

Of the different activities that repair <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>breaks,</b> defects in resolving damaged DNA termini {{are among the}} most common causes of neuronal cell death. Here, the molecular mechanisms of some of the DNA end processing activities are reviewed and the association with human neurodegenerative disease is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Changes {{in levels}} of {{transcription}} {{can be difficult to}} gauge in animals with lethal mutations. For example, mutations in a regulatory region of an essential gene can have secondary consequences that complicate attempts to quantify the transcripts produced by the mutant gene. We describe a method that circumvents this problem by revealing the relative amount of transcript produced from each allele in a heterozygote. With this method, recessive lethal mutations can be analyzed in animals that are phenotypically wild type. We used this technique to analyze mutations in the regulatory region of the Drosophila engrailed gene and found that truncations reduce transcription to levels that depend both upon the tissue and upon the location of the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>break.</b> We also found that these mutations affect expression of the linked invected gene, suggesting that engrailed and invected share a complex set of regulatory elements that operate over at least 85 kb. We suggest that this technique will have general utility for the quantitation of allele-specific transcripts, even when amounts of tissue are limiting...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} study we localized the synovial sarcoma-associated t(X; 18) (p 11;q 11) breakpoint within the ornithine aminotransferase-like 1 (OATL 1) cluster on the X chromosome. This localization was delineated from both somatic cell hybrid and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) analysis of patient material, using OAT-specific cDNA and YAC probes. Simultaneously, Knight et al. (1992, MoL Hum. Genet, in press) mapped this same breakpoint in their patient material adjacent to the more proximal OATL 2 region on the X chromosome. Here we report the analysis of two additional tumors and demonstrate that again in these cases the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>break</b> occurs within the OATL 1 cluster. In order to further specify the breakpoint, we subcloned the OATL 1 YAC (no. 2) into cosmids. At least one of these cosmids (0. 38) hybridizes to sequences that bracket the translocation breakpoint, as demonstrated by both Southern blot and FISH analysis. These observations confirm and substantiate our previous findings. In addition, cosmid 0. 38 should be a valuable instrument for the ultimate isolation and identification of the gene(s) involved in the development of synovial sarcoma...|$|R
