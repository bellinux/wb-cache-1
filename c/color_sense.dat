[...] He excelled at drawing but seemed to lack any natural <b>color</b> <b>sense.</b> [...] He later recalled, [...] "During the third winter I even realized that I probably would never learn to paint." [...] During these times of youthful adventure, Klee spent much time in pubs and had affairs with lower class women and artists' models. He had an illegitimate son in 1900 who died several weeks after birth.|$|E

40|$|For many organisms, {{color is}} an {{essential}} source of information from visual scenes. The larval zebrafish {{has the potential to}} be a model for the study of this topic, given its tetrachromatic retina and high dependence on vision. In this study we took a step towards understanding how the larval zebrafish might use <b>color</b> <b>sensing.</b> To this end, we used a projector-based paradigm to force a choice of a color stimulus at every turn of the larva. The stimuli used spanned most of the larval spectral range, including activation of its Ultraviolet (UV) cone, which has not been described behaviorally before. We found that zebrafish larvae swim towards visible wavelengths (> 400 nm) when choosing between them and darkness, as has been reported with white light. However, when presented with UV light and darkness zebrafish show an intensity dependent avoidance behavior. This UV avoidance does not interact cooperatively with phototaxis towards longer wavelengths but can compete against it in an intensity dependent manner. Finally, we show that the avoidance behavior depends on the presence of eyes with functional UV cones. These findings open future avenues for studying the neural circuits that underlie <b>color</b> <b>sensing</b> in the larval zebrafish...|$|R

40|$|In many situations, {{autonomous}} robots {{can provide}} effective solutions to gruelling tasks. In this case, {{it is desirable}} to create an autonomous robot that can identify objects from the conveyor belt and relocate them if the object meets certain criteria. Dealing {{with a large number}} of objects is a very menial task, this is an excellent application for a robot of this type. In this case, to keep costs and design complexity low, the robot is designed around the platform and uses several different sensors to collect information about the robots environment to allow the robot to react accordingly. This paper aims at the problem I am attempting to solve is to create an autonomous robot that can identify objects when placed on the conveyor belt based on <b>color</b> <b>sensing</b> and then sort by relocating them to a specific location. It will be using a picking arm which uses a controller motor to pick the particular object from the conveyor belt and place it according to the <b>color</b> <b>sensing.</b> Micro controller (AT 89 S 52) allows dynamic and faster control.

40|$|Disordered multihyperuniform many-particle {{systems are}} exotic {{amorphous}} states that allow exquisite <b>color</b> <b>sensing</b> capabilities {{due to their}} anomalous suppression of density fluctuations for distinct subsets of particles, as recently evidenced in photoreceptor mosaics in avian retina. Motivated by this biological finding, we present the first statistical-mechanical model that rigorously achieves disordered multihyperuniform many-body systems by tuning interactions in binary mixtures of non-additive hard-disk plasmas. We demonstrate that multihyperuniformity competes with phase separation and stabilizes a clustered phase. Our work provides a systematic means to generate disordered multihyperuniform solids, enabling one to explore their potentially novel photonic, phononic, electronic and transport properties...|$|R

30|$|However, {{there are}} a few studies that look at the {{experiences}} of women of color regarding belonging (i.e., Johnson 2012; Mickelson et al. 2015), but this body of literature remains underdeveloped. Other studies about belonging in STEM fields that discuss racial identity often omit a gender analysis, additionally excluding women of color from the literature. There exist other intersectional works that investigate women of color’s experiences (e.g., Carlone and Johnson 2007; Crenshaw 1991), but we had difficulty finding literature that focused on women of <b>color’s</b> <b>sense</b> of belonging. In this manuscript, we attempt to fill this literature gap by explicitly discussing intersections of race and gender in our analyses.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} cause of color {{blindness}} is an inherited fault in the development of {{one or more of the}} three sets of <b>color</b> <b>sensing</b> cones in the eye. Males are more likely to be color blind than females, as the genes responsible for the most common forms of color blindness are on the X chromosome. As females have two X chromosomes, a defect in one is typically compensated for by the other, while males only have one X chromosome. Color blindness can also result from physical or chemical damage to the eye, optic nerve, or parts of the brain. Diagnosis is typically with the Ishihara color test; however a number of other testing methods also exist.|$|R
