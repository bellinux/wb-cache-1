50|$|The {{serpentine}} {{leaf miner}} is the larva of a fly, Liriomyza brassicae, {{in the family}} Agromyzidae, the leaf <b>miner</b> <b>flies.</b> It mines wild and cultivated plants, such as cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower and Chinese broccoli.|$|R
50|$|To control heavy infestations, {{the leaves}} {{can be removed}} {{during the winter months}} before the adult flies emerge and destroyed. Insecticides can be used with limited {{effectiveness}} in controlling larvae and fly populations in the plant. Insecticides may harm non-leaf <b>miner</b> <b>flies</b> if applied during the hellebores flowering period.|$|R
5000|$|Veronica strictissima is {{eaten by}} grazing {{species such as}} sheep, goats and cows.. The fruit are eaten by lizards and birds. Lizards and birds also feed on the nectar [...] The flowers are pollinated by a native bee, Lasioglossum sordidum which feeds off the nectar and takes pollen with it.. Veronica strictissima and other species from the genus Veronica are also fed on by hebe plume moth Platyptilia and large hebe loopers Xyridacma veronicae. Hebe gall midges, hebe leaf <b>miner</b> <b>flies</b> and hebe gall mites also live off Veronica strictissima.|$|R
50|$|Phytomyza hellebori or more {{commonly}} known as the Hellebore leaf miner is a small fly that infests only the H. foetidus plants in the Hellebore family. The leaf <b>miner</b> <b>fly</b> digs tunnels into the leaves of the H. foetidus. The tunnels create brownish-black blotches on the plant. These will later turn into a nesting ground where the flies will lay their larvae in. The leaves will turn a brownish-white along where the tunnels were dug as time goes on. The larvae will start to eat the inside of the leaves in August, and damage will develop from the late summer to the early spring, with heavy attacks leaving the foliage disfigured by spring.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{mines in}} remote areas have a {{traditional}} company town (for example Roxby Downs or Leigh Creek), or support towns {{that used to be}} company towns such as Broken Hill and Mount Isa.Most mines {{in remote areas}} are operated on a fly-in-fly-out basis where the miners' [...] "home" [...] and family remains in a major city, and the <b>miners</b> <b>fly</b> out to their mine for two weeks of 12 hours a day solid work, then fly home for one week of rest. The rosters vary from company to company and from site to site. Every site has people on different rosters, mainly {{due to the fact that}} many aspects of a whole mine operation are carried out by contracting companies and they may / will offer different working conditions. 3 weeks on / 1 week off rosters are not uncommon and the working away period can be, but seldom is, for much longer than 2 or 3 weeks.|$|R
50|$|Eureka {{is a small}} eastern {{suburb of}} Ballarat, Victoria, Australia - (AU). It was {{originally}} part of Ballarat East but became its own suburb in 1946 {{in recognition of the}} area's significance to Australian history. Eureka is bordered by Specimen Creek to the north, Canadian Creek to the south, Queen and Joseph streets to the west and Kline and Stawell Street to the east. The suburb takes its name from the Eureka Lead - a lead is an ancient river bed that contains gold - of the Eureka Mining Company and is most notable as the site of the historic event of the Eureka Rebellion. This was the site where the rebel <b>miners</b> <b>flew</b> the by the Eureka Flag for the first time, a flag that has since become a symbol of the working class and trade union movement. The site is marked by several monuments and a museum called the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka (M.A.D.E), which opened in May 2013 and houses the original Eureka Flag, on loan from the Art Gallery of Ballarat.|$|R
40|$|AbstractNowadays {{the higher}} {{occurrence}} of cereal insects is observed. Until recently {{it has been}} considered to be of little economic relevance. Today cereal insects develop better, thanks to the climate warming, simplification of agricultural techniques and extensive farming in large areas. One of the most pervasive species is leaf miners from the Agromyzidae family, which larvae feed on inner side of the cereal leaves. In Poland {{there is more than}} a dozen species of leaf miners (Walczak, 1995). They may occur locally in large numbers, and cause substantial damage to the crops which reduce quality and quantity of the harvest. Larvae of the leaf miner feed on the parenchyma, causing damages (so-called mines). Effective methodology of fighting the insects with chemical means have not been developed yet. Studies of integrated methods of cereals protection carried out so far, have shown that a good practical method of chemical signaling is to control the number of adults trapped on yellow traps. Monitoring of cereal leaf miner flights in winter wheat was carried out in Słupia Wielka and Baborówko (Greater Poland Voivodeship) in the 2011 / 2012 and 2012 / 2013 growing seasons. Yellow traps were placed above the tops of wheat during vegetation period. The number of damaged wheat stems was recorded. Fluctuations in weather conditions during the research affected the dynamics of leaf <b>miner</b> <b>flies</b> considerably. The most common species were: Chromatomyia nigra (Ztt.), Chromatomyia fuscula (Ztt.) and Poemyza superciliosa (Ztt.) ...|$|R
50|$|The noisy miner {{engages in}} most {{activities}} in a group. Roosting, foraging, preening, bathing and dust-bathing or anting are communal activities. Dawn song is a communal chorus, {{particularly during the}} breeding season. The communal interaction is facilitated by ritualised displays that have been categorised as flight displays, postural displays, and facial displays. In 'long flight' displays, initiated by either male or female birds, groups of up to twenty birds {{from more than one}} coterie fly about 40 m above the canopy for distances of up to 1.5 km from the colony, constantly calling and not returning to the colony for about twenty minutes. As they return the remaining birds show signs of agitation, and sometimes fly up to join them. The 'short flight' display is performed by the male, and may be analogous to the territorial advertising displays of other birds. In a ritualised movement, the noisy <b>miner</b> <b>flies</b> out from a perch across an open area, in a rhythmic undulating pattern, usually calling in flight. At the end of the clearing it turns on an upward swoop and flies silently back to a perch near the starting point. The 'head-up flight' is performed by the female during the nesting period, and may function to attract male helpers. In its most intense form the body and tail are held almost vertically, with legs dangling and the head held up and back. It is performed by the female when she is selecting the nest site, and when carrying nest-building material, and probably has the function of indicating the location of the nest to other group members.|$|R
50|$|Phytomyza ilicis, the holly leaf <b>miner,</b> is a <b>fly</b> whose larvae burrow into {{leaves of}} the holly tree (Ilex aquifolium) leaving {{characteristic}} pale trails or leaf mines. The holly leaf miner has frequently been used in ecological studies as a system to study food webs since examination of the leaves can reveal whether the leaf miner has successfully emerged, been killed by a parasitic wasp, or been predated by blue tits.|$|R
40|$|Field {{trials were}} {{conducted}} {{for three years}} (1997 - 1999) to study the effectiveness of different neem formulations against the major insect pests complex and on yield of okra (Hibiscus esculentus), tomato (Lycopersicon escculentum), and onion (Allium cepa). Neem kernel powder was applied into the soil (NKPS), sprayed as water extract on the target plants (ANKE) or applied as water extract into the soil (ANKES). The registered German formulated neem seed extract (NeemAzal), includes Azadirachtin as main active principle, and, the Japanese trade product (Sumicidin) were also used for comparison. The experiments were conducted in the Shambat area of Khartoum in the Sudan. ANKE showed significant increase on yield of okra during the two seasons 1997 (162 %), 1998 (52 %), tomato 1998 (74 %). An increase by 28 % of Okra 1999 was also obtained (nicht significant). Against the insect pests of okra, the product {{reduced the number of}} cotton aphids Aphis gossypii, white fly Bemisia tabaci (Genn.), the number of plants infested by the larvae of the spotted boll worm Earias vittella and the number of leaves damaged by the adults of the flea beetle Podagrica puncticollis significantly. A reduction by 35 % of the number of aphids on okra grown in the year 1999 was also recorded. Against the insect pest complex of tomato, ANKE reduced the number of the leaves damaged by the larvae of the leaf miner Liriomyza trifolii significantly, while it reduced the number of aphids by 40 %, and the number of white fly by 33 % under the control. The product increased the weight of onion grown in the year 1999 by 15 % over the control. A reduction by 21 % and 26 % of the number of cotton thrips T. tabaci on onion grown on the year 1998 and 1999 respectively, was also recorded. NeemAzal increased the yield of okra grown in the years 1997, 1998, and 1999 significantly. It succeeded also in the significant reduction of number of aphids on okra grown in the year 1998 and 1999, the number of plants infested with the larvae of spotted boll worm and the number of leaves damaged by the adults of flea beetle. It reduced the number of white fly not significantly by 58 %. On tomato, NeemAzal increased the yield by 38 % over the control (nich significant). It reduced the number of the leaves damaged by the larvae of the leaf <b>miner</b> and white <b>fly</b> significantly, while it reduced the number of aphids only by 10 % under the control. On onion, NeemAzal showed similar results as that of ANKE. NKPS increased the yield of okra grown in the year 1997 by 32 % and the yield of tomato by 46 %. On okra grown in the year 1998, it reduced the number of white flies and leaves damaged by the adults of flea beetle significantly, while it reduced the number of aphids only by 19 %. On tomato, it reduced the number of white fly by 13 % as compared with the control. ANKES reduced the number of white fly on okra grown in the year 1998 significantly. The results of NKPS and ANKES indicate a systemic movement of neem compounds from the root to the leaves. Sumicidin gave almost the same results as ANKE and NeemAzal in significant reduction of the number of tomato leaves damaged by the larvae of the leaf <b>miner.</b> Against white <b>fly</b> on tomato, Sumicidin showed the same results as NeemAzal in significant reduction of the number by 60 %, but better as ANKE, which showed non-significant reduction by 40 %. Against aphids on tomato, Sumicidin gave significant reduction of the number by 60 %, while the reduction by ANKE and NeemAzal was not significant by 40 % and 10 % respectively. Although Sumicidin showed generally better results as the three-neem products (NeemAzal, ANKE and NKPS) against the target insect pest of tomato, all neem products gave yield higher than it did. On onion plants, Sumicidin showed better, but not significant effects on the weight and against cotton thrips than NeemAzal and ANKE. The results are summarized in Table 14, 15, and 16. A strong positive effect on the growth rate, vigor, plant height and number of leaves of okra and tomato plants treated with ANKE and NeemAzal were observed...|$|R
