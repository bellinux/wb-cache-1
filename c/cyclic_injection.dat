30|$|The {{length of}} MTCs {{depends on the}} number of cycles {{required}} for the initial progressive <b>cyclic</b> <b>injection</b> phase (depending on the data available from previous injections, a minimum of four to six cycles are required to determine the fracture opening pressure FOP based on a change in slope in the pressure–flow rate curve, with two or three data points below the FOP in the matrix flow-dominated regime and two or three data points above the FOP in the fracture flow-dominated regime) and the uniform <b>cyclic</b> <b>injection</b> phase (according to Fokker et al. (2017), a minimum of five cycles is required for good data quality of hydraulic pulse testing analysis, if this analysis is intended to be done), and the length of the LTCs. The optimization of this and other parameters needs to be further researched. Since cyclic opening and closure of fractures may damage the fracture transmissivity (e.g., Vogler et al. 2016), the pressure of the uniform <b>cyclic</b> <b>injection</b> phase should not be below the fracture closure pressure.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The Bachaquero- 01 reservoir of the Lagunillas field is located {{in the eastern part of}} the Maracaibo Lake, Venezuela. The field is operated by the national oil company of Venezuela, PDVSA (Petroleos de Venezuela, S. A.). The Bachaquero- 01 heavy oil reservoir lies at about 3, 000 ft. ss. and contains 7. 037 BSTB of 1 1. 7 degrees API gravity oil with an in-situ viscosity of 635 cp. Cold production began in 1960, but since 1971 the reservoir was produced under a massive <b>cyclic</b> steam <b>injection</b> system. To-date some 370 cyclic-steam injection welts have produced from the reservoir, yielding a cumulative oil recovery of only about 5. 6 % of initial oil-in-place. The reservoir pressure has dropped from an initial 1, 370 psia to its present value of about 700 psia. Maximum oil production peaked at 45. 0 MSTB/D in 1991, and has since continued to decline. To arrest production decline, three horizontal cyclic-steam injection wells were drilled and completed in the reservoir in 1995 - 1997. The horizontal sections were from 1, 280 to 1, 560 ft long and were drilled in locations with existing vertical <b>cyclic</b> steam <b>injection</b> welts. Three-dimensional thermal-compositional simulation studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of the three horizontal welts under <b>cyclic</b> steam <b>injection</b> and steamflooding. The Cartesian model dimensions of the three horizontal welts were 11 x 22 x 4, 11 x 27 x 5, and 12 x 20 x 5. In the steamflooding scheme investigated, the existing horizontal welts were used as injectors while existing (and new) vertical welts surrounding the horizontal welts were used as producers. Simulation results indicate oil recovery under <b>cyclic</b> steam <b>injection</b> to be about 15 % of initial oil-in-place, compared to about 25 % under steamflooding with no new producers, and about 50 % under steamflooding with additional producers. The main advantages of steamflooding over <b>cyclic</b> steam <b>injection</b> were in the re-pressurization and improved thermal efficiency for the Bachaquero- 01 reservoir. Higher oil recovery with additional wells resulted from improved areal sweep efficiency. Further study is planned to investigate steamflooding for the rest of the reservoir...|$|R

In this paper, an advanced fluid injection scheme is proposed that aims to mitigate these unwanted events and to improve the permeability enhancement process. Amongst other procedures, it involves different types of <b>cyclic</b> <b>injection</b> and a traffic light system specifically designed for <b>cyclic</b> <b>injection</b> schemes.

Nitrogen huff-n-puff and water huff-n-puff efficacy in the Eagle Ford shale outcrop was compared (Yu and Sheng 2016). The experimental {{results show that the}} shale oil recovery by nitrogen huff-n-puff outperformed water huff-n-puff under the same conditions. The oil recovery by water huff-n-puff using 24  h of soaking time after 12 cycles is 15 %, while the nitrogen huff-n-puff recovers 25 % shale oil. Soaking time influences the oil recovery in the laboratory. Using 24  h of soaking recovered 25 % oil in place, while 18 % of oil in place was produced by 1  h of soaking.

40|$|Effective Gravel-packing of {{horizontal}} wells {{is difficult to}} achieve, using conventional pre-slotted liners, yet it is generally required in the soft Heavy Oil reservoir rocks of California, where <b>cyclic</b> steam <b>injection</b> has been proven {{to be the most}} cost-effective oil recovery method. The proposed method of gravel placement behind a non-perforated liner, which is later perforated {open_quotes}in situ{close_quotes} with a new tool operated by coiled-tubing, is expected to greatly reduce costs resulting from sand production in horizontal wells operated under <b>cyclic</b> steam <b>injection.</b> The detailed configuration of the prototype tool is described.

30|$|Similar to MTCs, in STCs uniform <b>cyclic</b> <b>injection</b> {{intends to}} reduce the maximum {{magnitude}} of induced seismic events, {{to reduce the}} fracture breakdown pressure, and to increase fracture network complexity. The shorter pressure pulses are intended to amplify the fatiguing and weakening of the rock by inducing additional small fissures before and besides macroscopic fracture development. In reported experiments, often these <b>cyclic</b> <b>injection</b> effects were increased when more cycles were performed (e.g., Zang et al. 2018). For example, Diaz et al. (2018 a, b) observed a decrease in maximum acoustic emission amplitude, fraction of tensile cracks (compared to shear cracks) and seismic injection efficiency with increasing number of cycles and Zhuang et al. (2016) reported development of multiple branching fractures specifically for high cycle numbers. Additionally, they pointed out that such a complex fracture pattern was also observed for a case where 150 cycles were performed without failure followed by monotonic injection until failure. This experiment suggests that small fissures are induced by <b>cyclic</b> <b>injection</b> before macroscopic failure. These large cycle numbers can only be achieved by very short cycle lengths, which results in STCs. Since the “hydraulic fatigue” effect is {{the main purpose of}} STCs, more details about fatigue are given here. While experiments and theories about hydraulic fatigue of rock are limited (e.g., Zang et al. 2018; Hofmann et al. 2018), a much larger number of experiments and theories exist that investigate and describe “mechanical fatigue” of rock without fluid injection (e.g., Cerfontaine and Collin 2017) and mechanical fatigue of industrial materials by cyclic loading (e.g. Fatemi and Yang 1998). Mechanical and hydraulic fatigue behavior relies on the heterogeneity and imperfections of the medium that is subject to load or pressure cycles. Since rock masses in general are very heterogeneous and intersected by faults, fractures and fissures at all scales, fatigue behavior is likely more pronounced in geological media compared to engineered materials. Whether and how classical fatigue concepts can be applied to hydraulic fatigue by <b>cyclic</b> <b>injection</b> and pressure pulses remains subject of further research. Observations from cyclic loading experiments on rock, for example, show that besides the strength reduction, additionally, cyclic loading has the potential to decrease Young’s modulus (up to[*]~[*] 33 %) and increase Poisson’s ratio (up to[*]~[*] 600 %) with increasing cycle number (Heap and Faulkner 2008; Heap et al. 2009, 2010; Cerfontaine and Collin 2017). Thus, Shear Modulus G of the tested specimens is reduced, which would in turn potentially result in a magnitude reduction of induced seismic events (cf. Eqs.  2,   3). In the cyclic loading experiments by Heap et al. (2009, 2010), summarized by Cerfontaine and Collin (2017), G is reduced by[*]~[*] 43 % from[*]~[*] 13.5 to[*]~[*] 7.7 GPa after 14 cycles. However, these mechanical cyclic loading experiments were conducted over a large stress range (from 0 to[*]>[*] 100  MPa). In <b>cyclic</b> <b>injection,</b> the effective stress changes are usually much lower. Therefore, reduction of G can only be seen as a minor possible result of <b>cyclic</b> <b>injection</b> which remains to be proven, but not as its main purpose. Other rock properties are also affected by mechanical cyclic loading. For example, Erarslan et al. (2014) found that tensile cyclic loading of Brisbane tuff led to a reduction of static fracture toughness by up to 46 % and a reduction of indirect tensile strength by up to 36 %. G, fracture toughness and tensile strength reduction are also interpreted to be a result of microcrack development in the rock matrix. Ghamgosar and Erarslan (2016) illustrate the complex and wide fracture process zone resulting from cyclic loading of Cracked Chevron Notched Brazilian Disc Cadia Valley monsonite and Brisbane tuff specimens using computer tomography scans. Stephansson et al. (2018) performed <b>cyclic</b> <b>injection</b> tests with pressure pulses on top of progressively increasing pressure cycles at laboratory scale and found a breakdown pressure reduction from[*]~[*] 10 to[*]~[*] 20 % for fine-grained granite and diorite-gabbro, but no effect on Ävrö granodiorite, which suggests that hydraulic fatigue behavior is material dependent. A major motivation to apply STCs is that, compared to MTCs, in the mine-scale experiments performed by Zang et al. (2017), additional pressure pulses led to the largest hydraulic performance increase of all tested injection schemes (Zimmermann et al. 2018). More details about the hydraulic fatigue concept can be found in Zang et al. (2013, 2017, 2018).|$|E

30|$|In the {{described}} <b>cyclic</b> <b>injection</b> scheme, high-flow rate (HIR) phases are {{alternating with}} low-rate (LIR) or base-rate (BIR) phases {{with a very}} low injection rate. To avoid induced seismic events with a magnitude above a given threshold, a seismic traffic light system is needed to effectively mitigate these LMEs. In the context of cyclic stimulation, the immediate action items in the traffic light system were divided into actions during a high-injection rate phase (left column “Event @ HIR”) and actions during low- or base-rate injection (right column “Event @ LIR”).

40|$|A novel {{method to}} enhance oil {{production}} during <b>cyclic</b> steam <b>injection</b> has been developed. In the Top-Injection and Bottom-Production (TINBOP) method, the well contains two strings separated by two packers (a dual {{and a single}} packer) : the short string (SS) is completed in the top quarter of the reservoir, while the long string (LS) is completed in the bottom quarter of the reservoir. The method requires an initial warm-up stage where steam is injected into both strings for 21 days; then the LS is opened to production while the SS continues to inject steam for 14 days. After the initial warm-up, the following schedule is repeated: the LS is closed and steam is injected in the SS for 21 days; then steam injection is stopped and the LS is opened to production for 180 days. There is no soak period. Simulations to compare {{the performance of the}} TINBOP method against that of a conventional cyclic steam injector (perforated across the whole reservoir) have been made.

For the first two types, a 20 x 1 x 20 10 -acre model was used that incorporated typical rock and fluid properties for these fields.

40|$|Numerous early {{reports on}} {{experimental}} works {{relating to the}} role of wettability in various aspects of oil recovery have been published. Early examples of laboratory waterfloods show oil recovery increasing with increasing water-wetness. This result is consistent with the intuitive notion that strong wetting preference of the rock for water and associated strong capillary-imbibition forces gives the most efficient oil displacement. This report examines the effect of wettability on waterflooding and gasflooding processes respectively. Waterflood oil recoveries were examined for the dual cases of uniform and non-uniform wetting conditions. Based on the results of the literature review on effect of wettability and oil recovery, coreflooding experiments were designed to examine the effect of changing water chemistry (salinity) on residual oil saturation. Numerous corefloods were conducted on reservoir rock material from representative formations on the Alaska North Slope (ANS). The corefloods consisted of injecting water (reservoir water and ultra low-salinity ANS lake water) of different salinities in secondary as well as tertiary mode. Additionally, complete reservoir condition corefloods were also conducted using live oil. In all the tests, wettability indices, residual oil saturation, and oil recovery were measured. All results consistently lead to one conclusion; that is, a decrease in injection water salinity causes a reduction in residual oil saturation and a slight increase in water-wetness, both of which are comparable with literature observations. These observations have an intuitive appeal in that water easily imbibes into the core and displaces oil. Therefore, low-salinity waterfloods have the potential for improved oil recovery in the secondary recovery process, and ultra low-salinity ANS lake water is an attractive source of injection water or a source for diluting the high-salinity reservoir water. As part of the within-scope expansion of this project, <b>cyclic</b> water <b>injection</b> tests using high as well as low salinity were also conducted on several representative ANS core samples. These results indicate that less pore volume of water is required to recover the same amount of oil as compared with continuous water <b>injection.</b> Additionally, in <b>cyclic</b> water <b>injection,</b> oil is produced even during the idle time of water injection. It is understood that the injected brine front spreads/smears through the pores and displaces oil out uniformly rather than viscous fingering. The overall benefits of this project include increased oil production from existing Alaskan reservoirs. This conclusion is based on the performed experiments and results obtained on low-salinity water injection (including ANS lake water), vis-a-vis slightly altering the wetting conditions. Similarly, encouraging cyclic water-injection test results indicate that this method can help achieve residual oil saturation earlier than continuous water injection. If proved in field, this would be of great use, as more oil can be recovered through <b>cyclic</b> water <b>injection</b> for the same amount of water injected...|$|R

A reservoir simulation study was performed on a heavy oil reservoir with the main objective of evaluating possible development options beyond the existing cold production method. The 206 -acre area simulated - part of a significantly larger oil accumulation - lies about 3000 ft. ss. and has a gross thickness of 560 ft. The simulated area contains 120 MMSTB oil of 9 ? API gravity with in situ viscosity of 6, 000 cp. Production began in 1992 with the reservoir being drained by one vertical well, one slanted well and one horizontal well. The simulation study was conducted in a systematic manner using two types of commercial reservoir simulators to minimize computational time. For history matching the cold production period and forecasting of cold production cases, a black oil simulator was used (ECLIPSE 100). A fairly satisfactory match of the production and pressure data was obtained which required an analytical aquifer to be attached to {{the northern part of the}} reservoir. For thermal EOR cases, the oil was simulated as a hydrocarbon consisting of three pseudo components. These cases were run using a thermal compositional simulator (ECLIPSE 300). Simulation results indicate oil recovery, for the area developed by the existing horizontal well and two new horizontal wells, to be as follows. For cold production, the oil recovery amounts to 13 % of original-oil-in-place (OOIP). With <b>cyclic</b> steam <b>injection,</b> the recovery factor is slightly increased to 15 % OOIP. However, with steam flooding -utilizing the new horizontal wells as injectors - the recovery factor is significantly increased to 22 % OOIP. Steam flooding is evidently superior to <b>cyclic</b> steam <b>injection</b> primarily due to the fact that the reservoir is pressurized in the former EOR method and not in the latter, and to the fact that <b>cyclic</b> steam <b>injection</b> is more a near-wellbore thermal stimulation process as opposed to a more reservoir-wide heating process under steam flooding. Finally, with steam-propane injection (at a constant steam:propane mass ratio of 100 : 5), the oil recovery factor is further increased to 26 % OOIP. Simulation results indicate this EOR method creates a more favorable distribution of heat in the reservoir, thus better sweep efficiency and reduction in produced water cut. Selection of development options to be implemented would depend on the economics of each case. Economic evaluation of the various cases has not been covered in the thesis and is best done by the operator of the field...|$|R
