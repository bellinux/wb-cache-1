50|$|Tureens {{are most}} {{practical}} for serving about six people. In eighteenth-century France, a small individual covered standing bowl {{on a small}} platter, essentially an individual tureen, was called an écuelle (also anglicised to ecuelle). It could be lifted by its twin handles and drunk from directly. The shape was used for other purposes; it is often found in toilet services, where its purpose is uncertain. Its modern descendant in tableware is the two-handled cream soup bowl on matching plate. A small <b>covered</b> <b>dish</b> <b>for</b> sauce, called a saucière, could also {{take the form of}} a small tureen; it might be integral with its platter (illustration right), for ease in handling and to contain drips.|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{proposes a}} patch antenna array as an {{alternative}} feed <b>for</b> <b>dish</b> antennas on board satellites to solve the weight problem constituted by conventional feed horns. An 8 x 1 linear, C-Band, circular patch antenna array configuration with a broadside radiation pattern is designed as feed <b>for</b> a <b>dish</b> antenna with F/D ratio of 0. 36 corresponding to aperture illumination of 140 0. The result of analysis and simulations of the model using MATLAB and PCAAD 5. 0 software suggest that the patch antenna array feed radiation performance is very competitive when compared to that achieved with conventional feeds <b>for</b> <b>dish</b> antennas of the same F/D ratio.

Seeds were germinated in wet filter paper in <b>covered</b> Petri <b>dishes</b> <b>for</b> 3  days at room temperature in the dark. Then seedlings were transferred to a hydroponic culture plastic box (7  L) filled with modified Hoagland solution (pH =  6.0; 1.25  mM Ca(NO 3) 2, 1.25  mM KNO 3, 0.5  mM MgSO 4, 0.25  mM KH 2 PO 4; micronutrients: 10  µM H 3 BO 3, 1  µM MnSO 4, 0.5  µM ZnSO 4, 0.05  µM (NH 4) 6 Mo 7 O 24 and 0.4  µM CuSO 4) following Jelali et al. (2010). The nutrient solution was aerated with the aid of aquarium diffusers. One week later, seedlings were transferred to 37  L boxes (15 plants per box) filled with the same nutrient solution that was replaced weekly. Growing conditions in the growth chamber were 16  h light/ 8  h dark photoperiod, 18 / 20  °C, 65  % humidity, and a photon flux density of 200 – 300  µM m− 2  s− 1. Plants used in the experiments were six- to seven-week old.|$|R
