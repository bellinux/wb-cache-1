40|$|Oncology {{chemotherapeutics}} frequently {{exhibit a}} narrow therapeutic index, {{further complicated by}} the serious nature of dosing either too high (dangerous toxicities) or too low (loss of antitumor benefits). This underscores the need for optimal individualized drug selection and dosing, especially with agents that have wide interpatient variability. Pharmacogenomic assessment of drug metabolizing enzymes can improve the ability to optimally dose patients being treated with certain agents such as 6 -mercapto-purine, irinotecan, tamoxifen, and flurouracil. Two of these agents (6 -mercaptopurine and irinotecan) already have mention of pharmacogenomic testing in their FDA <b>approved</b> <b>package</b> inserts. Ongoing retrospective and prospective trials will help to further optimize the place in clinical practice for not only performing these pharmacogenomic assessments but, more importantly, how the results should be incorporated into therapy dosing decisions for patients...|$|R
50|$|MitraClip (mitral clip) is a novel, {{percutaneous}} {{method of}} heart treatment that is targeted {{for patients who}} have been denied surgery to fix mitral valve regurgitation. MitraClip was first implanted in 2003, and in 2013 became the FDA's first <b>commercially</b> <b>approved</b> alternative to mitral valve regurgitation surgery. Open-heart surgery is the standard method of treatment for patients with mitral valve regurgitation, however it is very invasive and not a feasible option for all patients. The risk of complications and mortality greatly increase in patients with other health conditions like liver disease, previous chest surgeries, and age above 75, {{which is why they}} are often denied surgery. The implantation of MitraClip via catheter does not involve open-heart surgery, but mimics the surgical method of edge-to-edge valve repair. The mitral valve leaflets are clipped together with the device instead of being sutured together, making this procedure much less invasive but still effective for improving the heart's blood outflow.|$|R

50|$|Bt {{was first}} {{discovered}} in 1901 by Japanese biologist S. Ishiwatari {{as the source}} of disease that was killing large populations of silkworms. Bt was first used as an insecticide in 1920 and spray formulations containing either Bt bacteria or Bt proteins came into use in the 1970s for crop protection, including organic farming operations. Bt insecticides saw expanded use and development in the 1980s as an alternative to synthetic insecticides. Beginning in the 1980s, the genes responsible for making Bt proteins were isolated and transferred into corn plants. Bt was <b>commercially</b> <b>approved</b> in transgenic corn seed in the mid-1990s. Compared to spray formulations, transgenic plants with the Bt protein provide much more effective insect protection throughout the season. Other Bt proteins have been used to genetically modify potatoes, cotton and other types of commercial corn. The two most common brands of transgenic Bt corn are Genuity and Herculex. Genuity Smartstax combines Monsanto's VT Triple Pro, Roundup Ready 2, and Acceleron Seed Treatment System technologies, as well as Dow Chemical's Herculex Xtra and Liberty Link technologies. Acceleron, Herculex Xtra, and VT Triple Pro include traits for protection from insect damage.|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the feasibility of}} coating formulated recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) on a titanium microneedle transdermal delivery system, Zosano Pharma (ZP) -hGH, and assessed preclinical patch delivery performance. Formulation rheology and surface activity were assessed by viscometry and contact angle measurement. rhGH liquid formulation was coated onto titanium microneedles by dip-coating and drying. The stability of coated rhGH was determined by size exclusion chromatography-high performance liquid chromatography (SEC-HPLC). Preclinical delivery and pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in female hairless guinea pigs (HGP) using rhGH coated microneedle patches at 0. 5 and 1 mg doses and compared to Norditropin® a <b>commercially</b> <b>approved</b> rhGH subcutaneous injection. Studies demonstrated successful rhGH formulation development and coating on microneedle arrays. The ZP-hGH patches remained stable at 40 °C for six months with no significant change in % aggregates. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the rhGH-coated microneedle patches, delivered with high efficiency and the doses delivered indicated linearity with average Tmax of 30 min. The absolute bioavailability of the microneedle rhGH patches was similar to subcutaneous Norditropin® injections. These results suggest that ZP-transdermal microneedle patch delivery of rhGH is feasible and may offer an effective and patient-friendly alternative to currently marketed rhGH injectables...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe Intermountain Cystic Fibrosis Pediatric Center {{utilizes}} ticarcillin–clavulanate 400 mg/kg/day divided every 6 h, (maximum 24 g/day). This dosing {{strategy is}} higher than the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) recommendations and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <b>approved</b> <b>package</b> labeling. The purpose is to determine the safety of this dosing regimen. MethodsA retrospective study of pediatric cystic fibrosis (CF) patients admitted from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2009 who received the dosing regimen for at least 7 days. Baseline and follow-up laboratory parameters were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed. Results 127 patients met inclusion criteria. The mean (±SD) ticarcillin dose was 3. 5 g (± 2. 16) every 6 h; while the mean (±SD) total ticarcillin dose was 13. 5 g (± 6. 5) per day. No significant differences occurred in liver function tests, white blood count, and platelet count from baseline. Serum creatinine showed a statistically significant decrease from baseline. ConclusionsHigher than FDA approved doses of ticarcillin–clavulanate may be safely used in the treatment of exacerbations in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients...|$|R

The most notable activity occurred in 1987, when the FDA suggested different warnings about the risk of arterial exposure, and in 1988, when Wyeth submitted revised labeling incorporating the proposed changes. The FDA did not respond. Instead, in 1996, it requested from Wyeth the labeling then in use and, without addressing Wyeth's 1988 submission, instructed it to [...] "retain verbiage in the current label" [...] regarding intra-arterial injection. After a few further changes to the labeling not related to intra-arterial injection, the FDA cleared Wyeth's 1981 application in 1998, instructing that Phenergan's final printed label [...] "must be identical" [...] to the <b>approved</b> <b>package</b> insert.|$|R
