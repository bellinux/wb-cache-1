5|$|Skanderbeg {{had kept}} the {{captured}} Ottoman foot-soldiers under his control, however.

Skanderbeg, however, had sent Moses of Dibra around Tahip's rear flanks in order to weaken the Ottoman army before launching his main attack.

5|$|In June 1943, Mayer {{encountered}} Robert S. Johnson, {{a future}} ace from the 56th Fighter Group of the US Eighth Air Force.

As Johnson limped home, with a canopy {{that would not}} open and hydraulic fluid and oil <b>covering</b> <b>his</b> windscreen, Mayer pulled alongside him in his Fw 190.

The first gun pass failed to knock the heavy American fighter out of the sky. Mayer made two more runs on Johnson, without success. After running out of ammunition, Mayer pulled alongside Johnson, saluted him and headed for home. Johnson landed his plane, and counted more than 200 holes, without even moving around the airplane. He also saw that a 20mm cannon shell had exploded just behind his headrest, which had made it impossible to open his canopy.|$|E
