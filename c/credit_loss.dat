5000|$|The [...] "casino economy" [...] craze of {{the late}} 1980s caught on also at STS. In 1989, the bank was {{transformed}} into a commercial bank, and foundations controlled by the leftist political parties SDP and SKP bought shares, intending to fund their activities with the profits of the bank. However, loose credit policies and the subsequent <b>credit</b> <b>loss</b> due to the early 1990s recession were disastrous for the bank. Esko Seppänen has opined that STS had become a sort of a [...] "cash dispenser" [...] from which clients could get cash without any strict payback obligation. As much as 40% of the loans were given against the bank's own policies, and 22% had indications of deliberate abuse. STS {{was one of the main}} contributors to the early 1990s banking crisis in Finland, where the country was at the brink of a banking system and economic collapse. In 1992, in addition to the official loss of 500 million markka (Mmk), concealed was 740 Mmk bad debt, 700 Mmk asset overvaluation and 300 Mmk miscellaneous losses. Furthermore, STS had borrowed ½ billion to the cooperative retailer EKA and the construction company Haka, both bound for bankruptcy. An assetless shell, Siltapankki Oy, remained with the bad debt. Facing bankruptcy, the remaining parts were sold in 1992 to another major bank, Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, which took over the operations and terminated its independent brand and existence. The owning foundation received only 75 million markka in the form of KOP shares (itself ripe for bankruptcy), thus leading to an immediate loss of 175 million markka (ca. 30 million euro). The government merged Siltapankki with the bad bank Arsenal in 1995. All savings customers were fully refunded. The total cost to taxpayers was ca. 2 billion Finnish markka (around 0.5 billion in 2010 euros) according to Esko Seppänen.|$|E

40|$|We derive {{the exact}} loss {{distribution}} for portfolios of bonds or cor-porate loans {{when the number}} of risks grows indefinitely.

Knowledge of the dis-tribution and its tail behavior is important for risk management in order not to over- or underestimate the likelihood of extreme credit losses for the portfolio as a whole. Conform to the credit risk literature, we assume that bond (or loan) defaults are triggered by a latent variable model involving two stochastic variables: systematic and idiosyncratic risk of the bond. It is shown that the tail behavior of these two variables translates into the tail behavior of the whole <b>credit</b> <b>loss</b> distribution. Surprisingly, even if both variables are thin-tailed, the <b>credit</b> <b>loss</b> distribution can have a finite tail index.

Based on a comprehensive dataset of potential CLE proxies retrieved from original financial reports of 32 Australasian banks (1980 – 2005), this article analyses properties and interactions of potential proxies through time. It is found that some commonly used proxies correlate rather poorly and bad debt provisioning is only partially matched by subsequent write-offs. Moreover, even derecognitions in the form of write-offs do not seem to be definite as up to 25 % of loans written-off are ultimately recovered.

Based on the limiting distribution and empirical data, it appears that the Basle 8 % rule is not an unreasonable approximation for high confidence (99. 9 %) quantiles of credit losses of a typical portfolio of rated corporate bonds. The practical relevance of our results for credit risk management is investigated by checking the applicability of the limiting distribution to portfolios with a finite number of exposures. It appears that for relatively homogeneous portfolios a minimum of 300 exposures is enough, while for relatively heterogeneous portfolios a number of 800 exposures suffices to obtain an adequate approximation.

The model encompasses default mechanisms in popular models of portfolio credit risk, such as CreditMetrics and CreditRisk+.

In many cases the <b>credit</b> <b>loss</b> distribution has a polynomial (rather than exponential) tail. This feature is robust to changes in tail characteristics of the underlying risk factors.

We then use conditional distributions derived from copulas that express tail dependence (stronger dependence across higher losses) to estimate the probability of <b>credit</b> <b>losses</b> in extreme scenarios (crises). Next, we present an example based on a specific copula that indicates upper-tail dependence among <b>credit</b> <b>losses.</b> Simulations show that, for both credit classes tested (retail and corporate), the alternative method outperforms the Basel formula which, in turn, is prone to result in insufficient capital when the losses have positively-skewed distributions (long tail in the right side) and are upper-tail dependent (a realistic representation of credit portfolios, according to the literature).

Apart from giving {{a discussion on}} the suggested 65 variables the issue of potential problems in developing rating models is raised and possible solutions are reviewed. A unique data set on credit risk analysis for the Austrian market is constructed and used to derive rating models for three different default definitions, i. e. bankruptcy, restructuring, and delay-inpayment. The models are compared to examine whether the models developed on the tighter default criteria, that are closer to the definition proposed by Basel II, do better in predicting these <b>credit</b> <b>loss</b> events than the model estimated on the traditional and more easily observable default criterion bankruptcy. Several traditional methods to compare rating models are used, but also a rigorous statistical test is discussed and applied.
