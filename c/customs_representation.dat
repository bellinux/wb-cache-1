40|$|This thesis {{details the}} {{application}} of computational methods {{to the problem of}} determining <b>custom</b> data <b>representations</b> when building hardware accelerators for numerical computations. A majority of scientific applications which require hardware acceleration are implemented in IEEE- 754 double precision. However, in many cases the error tolerance requirements of the application are much less than the accuracy which IEEE- 754 double precision provides. By leveraging <b>custom</b> data <b>representations,</b> a more resource efficient hardware implementation arises thereby enabling greater parallelism and thus higher performance of the accelerator. The existing <b>custom</b> <b>representation</b> methods are unable to guarantee robust representations {{while at the same time}} adequately supporting ill-conditioned operators. Support for both of these scenarios is necessary for accelerating scientific calculations. To address this, we propose the use of a computational method based on Satisfiability-Modulo Theory (SMT). By capturing a calculation as a set of constraints, an SMT instance can be formulated which provides meaningful bounds even in the presence of ill-conditioned operators...|$|R

A disk {{image is a}} <b>custom</b> <b>representation</b> of filesystem which typically corresponds to an operating system configuration.

40|$|International audienceWe present HPP, a {{software}} designed for complex classes of motion planning problems, such as navigation among movable objects, manipulation, contact-rich multiped locomotion, or elastic rods in cluttered environments. HPP is an open-source {{answer to the}} lack of a standard framework for these important issues for robotics and graphics communities. HPP adopts a clear object oriented architecture, which makes it easy to implement parts of an existing planning algorithm, or entirely new algorithms. Python bindings and a visualization tool allow for fast problem setting and prototyping: a new algorithm can be implemented in just a few lines of code. HPP can be used for classic planning problems such as pick and place for mobile robots, but is specifically designed to solve problems where the motion of the robot is constrained. Examples of behaviors produced by HPP thanks to a generic constraint formulation include: maintaining a relative orientation between bodies, enforcing the static equilibrium of the robot, or automatically inferring that an object must be moved to allow locomotion. Constraints are tied to a <b>custom</b> <b>representation</b> of the kinematic chain, compatible with the Unified Robot Description format (URDF). To illustrate the possibilities of HPP, we present several recent scientific contributions implemented with HPP, most of which are provided with Python tutorials.

In this paper, {{we present a}} system that exploits the power and flexibility of the modern GPUs to store, render, and manipulate terrains with minimal CPU involvement. The central idea {{is to use a}} regular-grid representation and fixed size blocks/tiles that change in resolution. The potentially visible portion of the terrain is cached at the highest necessary resolution and is rendered from the GPU. The CPU sends a light geometry template which is expanded by the Geometry Shader to the triangles, using the heights stored in the GPU Cache. The CPU performs a coarse culling of the tiles with the GPU performing fine culling. The GPU cache is updated continuously as the viewpoint changes. Our system enables the terrain to be modified procedurally or edited interactively on the GPU with no CPU involvement. The terrain can also interact with a large number of external objects in real-time entirely within the GPU.

For Class II MHC alleles, the binding groove is open at both ends, causing ambiguity in the positional alignment between the groove and peptide, as well as creating uncertainty as to what parts of the peptide interact with the MHC. Moreover, the antigenic peptides have variable lengths, making naive modelling methods difficult to apply. This paper introduces a kernel method that can handle variable length peptides effectively by quantifying similarities between peptide sequences and integrating these into the kernel. Results The kernel approach presented here shows increased prediction accuracy with a significantly higher number of true positives and negatives on multiple MHC class II alleles, when testing data sets from MHCPEP 1, MCHBN 2, and MHCBench 3. Evaluation by cross validation, when segregating binders and non-binders, produced an average of 0. 824 A ROC for the MHCBench data sets (up from 0. 756), and an average of 0. 96 A ROC for multiple alleles of the MHCPEP database.

As generating a complete CCT reflecting every method call is expensive, {{recent research has}} focused on ef-ficiently approximating the CCT with sampling techniques.
