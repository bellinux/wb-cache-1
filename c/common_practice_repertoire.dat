40|$|Attempts {{are often}} made to explain {{collective}} action {{in terms of}} the interaction of individuals. A common objection to such attempts is that they are circular: Since every interaction presupposes the existence of <b>common</b> <b>practices</b> and <b>common</b> <b>practices</b> involve collective action, no analysis of collective agency in terms of interaction can reduce collectivity away. In this essay I will argue that this does not constitute a real circularity. It is true that <b>common</b> <b>practices</b> are presupposed in every attempt to explain collective action. However, {{this does not mean that}} every analysis of collective action presupposes an understanding of collective action. <b>Common</b> <b>practices</b> do not involve or presuppose particular collective actions. They are more fundamental than individual or collective agency. The subject of a <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> is not a "us" or "them", but the impersonal "one": "One does this and that". What "one does" is not yet a joint activity. It is not a particular action at all...|$|R
