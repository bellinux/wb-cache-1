40|$|We preliminarily {{find that}} {{providing}} sustainable land management (SLM) training to standard contact farmers and having them maintain demonstration plots {{within the community}} on a whole had low impact on the knowledge and adoption of SLM practices. However, the aspect of our intervention that targeted a traditionally disadvantaged group {{as far as their}} access to extension services, women, was somewhat successful in terms of improving their SLM knowledge and adoption rates. Having a female <b>contact</b> <b>farmer</b> increased the number of SLM techniques adopted by women by 10 percent. Both male and female farmers in this treatment group identified female (not male) contact farmers as a source of learning for both SLM practices and non SLMpractices suggesting knowledge spillovers. Furthermore, farmers were additionally inclined to teach others what they have learned in the communities with female contact farmers. While we are currently analyzing additional factors that may affect the ability of the intervention to influence behavior, our results have broader implications for improving extension services overall.

40|$|The International Food Policy Research Institute {{is leading}} a three-year {{research}} program to assess the state of agricultural extension and advisory services provision in Malawi in order to inform the national extension policy review and reformation of government and donor processes and programming. This research program includes {{a series of studies}} undertaken in response to a request by the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development to look closely at the state of extension services provision with the intent to further strengthen the contribution of these services to food security, economic growth, and the achievement of sustainable development goals. In this paper, we assess the flow of technical advice along the knowledge chain from scientists to farmers to identify the challenges in information provision. The advancement of social network literature has fostered the lead or <b>contact</b> <b>farmer</b> modality or farmer-to-farmer approach of information transmission. However, there is limited evidence regarding the information efficiency of this modality, and the reasons of the potential information loss. In this article, we assess information efficiency along the knowledge transmission chain from researchers to agricultural extension agents (EAs) to lead farmers (LFs) to other farmers. By asking the same set of questions about a fairly well known technology, pit planting, we construct a measure of knowledge at each node of the knowledge transmission chain. Descriptive evidence shows that the majority of information loss happens at the EA-to-LF link, and that the loss is potentially caused by limited attention of both EAs and LFs to all important details of the technology. With more evidence about the importance of knowledge for technology adoption, we suggest that EAs emphasize all crucial dimensions of an agricultural technique during demonstrations and visits in order to reduce information loss.

40|$|Rice needs will {{continue}} to increase along with the projected rate of population increase. The use of quality seed is the thing to get attention. PT Sang Hyang Seri (Persero) is a state-owned company engaged in producing certified hybrid rice seed. In the face of the competitive environment is very dynamic business and strategic, then PT Sang Hyang Seri (Persero) requires a comprehensive marketing strategy. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the factors that influence the voting behavior of hybrid seeds by farmers. The method used is multiple regression analysis. Factors that influence the voting behavior of hybrid seeds consist of Attitude, Subjective norm, and perceived behavior control. All three of these factors have a significant influence on peilaku purchase hybrid seeds. Factors that affect the purchase of hybrid seeds at PT Sang Hyang Seri (Persero) is a decisive factor in determining the success of marketing of hybrid seeds to consumers. The results of the interview respondents indicated that the factors affecting the purchase of hybrid seed is the attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavior control. Perceived behavior control or perceived behavior control according to respondents is a factor that determines the first affecting the level of purchase hybrid seeds. A further factor affecting is Subjective norm or subjective norm then the last one is the attitude. Farmers have confidence that the use of hybrid rice gives the impact of increased profits from production, harvest time will be faster, and will produce more tillers so that confidence can increase the intensity of the behavior of farmers in the purchase of hybrid rice seeds in hopes of farmers to obtain greater profits. The purchasing behavior of hybrid rice by farmers in the marketing area of PT Sang Hyang Seri (Persero) Regional I Sukamandi influenced by <b>contact</b> <b>farmer</b> who can be contacted, the suggestion of extension local hybrid rice, and the influence of most small marketing is done by PT Sang Hyang Seri (Persero) itself. Variables influence the perception of control behavior contrary to existing theories. The analysis showed a negative influence. It is possible for farmers who are in the hybrid rice production center. Moreover, it is generally rice farmers in the marketing of PT Sang Hyang Seri (Persero) Regional I Sukamandi using the last rice in 2014, at which time the existence of government subsidies that encourage farmers to use hybrid rice in order to increase national rice production...|$|E

The data were collected by personal interview from 210 respondents (made up of 42 extension agents, 84 <b>contact</b> <b>farmers</b> and 84 non-contact <b>farmers).</b> The <b>contact</b> and non-contact <b>farmers</b> were selected by simple random sampling. All the extension agents working in the zone studied were respondents. The results show that the <b>contact</b> <b>farmers</b> understand their roles, relate with extension agents as expected, perform the roles assigned to them both on their farms, and in passing on messages received from extension agents to non-contact farmers. Many factors were identified as affecting the performance of <b>contact</b> <b>farmers.</b> A weak positive correlation was found between the performance of <b>contact</b> <b>farmers</b> and their levels of education, the manner of selection, and the number of meetings attended by them.

The purpose of this research was to examine the extent {{and the manner in which}} <b>contact</b> <b>farmers</b> in the Training and Visit System of agricultural extension in two districts of eastern Paraguay influenced the dissemination of agricultural information among small-scale follower farmers. The study was conducted in October and November of 2000. Survey instruments were translated into Spanish and data were collected by personal interviews, informal conversations, and through participation in farmer meetings. This descriptive study was based on the responses of 35 <b>Contact</b> <b>Farmers</b> (CF) and 42 Follower Farmers (FF). Results showed that demographic characteristics of the two groups did not differ, except for the level of education (CFs' mean = 6. 83, FFs' mean = 5. 16, t value = 3. 07). The forms of communication used by <b>contact</b> <b>farmers</b> and preferred by follower farmers were individual visits and group meetings. Follower <b>farmers</b> preferred <b>contact</b> <b>farmers,</b> friends, and neighbors, and their own experience to information received from agricultural extensionists. Friends, neighbors, and <b>contact</b> <b>farmers</b> were sources of information that follower farmers stated were available on time, understandable, and trustworthy. Key findings for the adoption of five cotton practices were the following: Paraguayan REBA P- 279 was the most recommended, but the Argentine Guazuncho II was most grown; only 9. 5 % reported the use of the fertilizer formulated as 12 - 12 - 17 - 2; cultural methods of weed control were preferred to chemical control; a 5 % increase in plant density from the beginning to the end of the project was seen; and 88 % reported that they did not have enough information to control cotton diseases. The knowledge gained will be useful for extension workers, administrators, program managers, policymakers, funding organizations, and the general public to formulate guidelines and organize work programs for disseminating information more effectively to small cotton farmers. Results and recommendations will be presented to the board and staff members of the Agricultural Extension Directorate and the Ministry of Agriculture in order to develop strategies for effective methods of communication long needed among all involved in the agricultural extension process...|$|R

The farming activities were categorised as either livestock only (41 %), or mixed {{crops and livestock}} (59 %). The surveyed farmers kept mainly cattle (100 %), chickens (82 %) and goats (74 %). Most (94 %) of the farmers had kept livestock for prolonged periods mainly for income generation (97 %) and domestic consumption (59 %). These data show that livestock keeping was popular and could be harnessed to increase food security, although the farmers kept mainly low-producing indigenous cattle (98 %) which were grazed on unutilised land. The main production constraints mentioned by farmers included diseases (100 %), poor fertility (68 %) and lack of feed (56 %). The diseases varied with species of ruminants and included lumpy skin disease (71 %), diarrhoea (65 %) and helminthosis (62 %). The source of advice on management and treatment of the livestock was almost equally from private and government veterinary personnel. To improve livestock productivity, {{it is recommended that}} key stakeholders address the constraints mentioned in this study and in particular that the occurrence of diseases should be investigated with a view to developing sustainable control strategies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the formation, activities, results and impacts {{of an active}} Pig Systems Learning Alliance consisting of national and international researchers, development practitioners from NGOs and government extension services in northern Laos. The original objective of the researchers {{was to find a}} way to link with development practitioners in order to scale out a promising new technology, the supplementary feeding of the forage legume Stylosanthes guianensis CIAT 184 to village pigs. The case study showed that Alliance partners scaled out Stylo to more farmers in more villages more quickly than would have been possible through the government extension service or a single development project. The approach thus achieved the original objective. It also did a lot more: It created an informal network of like-minded professionals working for a diverse range of research and development organisations; it resulted in participants having a better understanding of the different institutional cultures of the research and development organisations involved in the Alliance; it improved the skills of Alliance participants in evaluating interventions with farmers and extending successful examples to other farmers and villages; and it helped them source relevant information through their new network <b>contacts.</b> <b>Farmers</b> benefited by having quick access to appropriate pig production technologies and working together with extension workers in selecting, evaluating and adapting new technologies for their situation...|$|R
