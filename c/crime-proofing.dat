40|$|Abstract Policing {{continues}} {{to struggle with}} the wave of mobile phone theft {{that emerged from the}} mid- 1990 s onwards. In this decade, the rate of increasemay be waning, but the next wavemay be approaching. Mobile phone smart wallets combine smart card technologywithmobile phones, and the potential for identity theft and financial crime [...] -and hence the attractiveness of theft [...] -is likely to increase with smart wallets. This could spur new forms of theft, violence and other crimes. However, the market testing of technologies in Japan may be inappropriate for <b>crime-proofing</b> purposes, because of Japan’s low crime rate. The criminogenic potential of smart card and mobile smart wallet technologies warrants further examination. If policing is to avoid a potential crime problem, discussions with manufacturers should begin before the problem takes hold. Characterization The Gary Larson cartoon mocking scientific ap-proaches to crime and policing would show two scenes. In the first, a gaggle of white-coated engi-neers celebrate the invention of the knife, one ex-claiming: ‘Cutting edge technology with no risk of misuse! ’ In the second, a herd of social scientists and police cluster around a knife, murmuring: ‘It cor-relates with serious assault, but how does this thing work?’...|$|E
40|$|The ‘crime drop’ is {{the most}} {{important}} criminological phenomenon of modern times. In North America, Europe, and Australasia, many common crimes have fallen by half or more since the early 1990 s, albeit with variation in the specifics. Seventeen explanations are examined here including demographics, policing, imprisonment, drug markets and lead poisoning. Some have been falsified, some lack evidence, some are inconsistent with the evidence, and some claim a minor contribution at most. Pioneering research that developed explanations only relevant to the United States now appears, with the benefit of hindsight, somewhat parochial. Sixteen of the seventeen hypotheses fail one or more of four evidence-based standardized tests on which they are assessed. The one that passes is the security hypothesis, underpinned by crime opportunity theories. Here there is strong evidence from four countries that vehicle theft fell due to more and better security, and mounting evidence that improved security was critical in reducing burglary and other acquisitive crime. Many crime types are inter-related, while most criminal careers are dominated by property crime, so removing these volume crimes might be expected to reduce violence. The policy implication of the security hypothesis is that governments should promote regulation and incentives to promote designing-out crime and <b>crime-proofing</b> for the remaining common crimes plus new and emerging crime types...|$|E
