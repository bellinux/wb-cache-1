40|$|High-yield pulp (HYP) such as {{bleached}} <b>chemi-thermo-mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> (BCTMP) from aspen wood, is {{now being}} used in the production of high-quality fine papers, and this is particularly true in China. In this study, the effect of using cationic polymers such as poly-aluminum chloride (PAC), polyethylenimine (PEI), cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM), and poly-(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) on Alkenyl Succinic Anhydride (ASA) sizing efficiency in HYP-containing pulp furnish was investigated. The results showed that the addition of only ASA emulsion to the HYP-containing furnish, without any cationic additives, did not yield an appreciable degree of sizing in the paper sheet. PAC (or alum) could improve the ASA sizing efficiency. PEI, PDADMAC, CPAM, and NaHCO 3 all improved ASA sizing efficiency in the presence of PAC. The charge density of PEI was important for improving the ASA sizing performance. Also, the sequence of adding the cationic polymer affected the ASA sizing performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{changes at}} {{molecular}} level induced by cold argon plasma treat-ments on fibers obtained from <b>chemi-thermo-mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> (CTMP) fibers were investigated. The radicals formed on CTMP fibers after treatments {{were identified and}} quantified by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The plasma conditions which maximize the formation of radicals on fibers were assessed: after treatment with 0. 4 mbar Ar pressure and 75 W radiofrequency power, phenoxy radicals triple their concentration in only 60 s and reach a value 4 times higher than that reported for laccase-catalyzed lignin oxidation. It was found that in plasma-treated fibers, the formation of radicals competes with their coupling. This latter result leads to cross-linkages of the lignin mono-meric units and formation of new intermonomeric C-C and C-O bonds, {{for the first time}} assigned to specific molecular interactions through Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (2 D-HSQC) spectroscopy and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy of carbon (13 C-NMR). These results were confirmed by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectros-copy of phosphorous (31 P-NMR). The lack of evidences of inter-fiber bond interactions, deduced from Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) data, suggests the possible application of plasma treatments for the production of wood fiber-based composites...|$|E
40|$|Wastewater {{samples from}} a Swedish <b>chemi-thermo-mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> (CTMP) mill {{collected}} at different purification stages in a {{wastewater treatment plant}} (WWTP) were analyzed with an amperometric enzyme-based biosensor array in a flow-injection system. In order to resolve the complex composition of the wastewater, the array consists of several sensing elements which yield a multidimensional response. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to decompose the array's responses, and found that wastewater with different degrees of pollution can be differentiated. With the help of partial least squares regression (PLS-R), we could link the sensor responses to the Microtox (R) toxicity parameter, {{as well as to}} global organic pollution parameters (COD, BOD, and TOC). From investigating the influences of individual sensors in the array, {{it was found that the}} best models were in most cases obtained when all sensors in the array were included in the PLS-R model. We find that fast simultaneous determination of several global environmental parameters characterizing wastewaters is possible with this kind of biosensor array, in particular because of the link between the sensor responses and the biological effect onto the ecosystem into which the wastewater would be released. In conjunction with multivariate data analysis tools, there is strong potential to reduce the total time until a result is yielded from days to a few minutes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Pulping of non-wood raw {{materials}} available in abundance by Kraft, soda and chemi-thermo-mechanical processes produces good quality pulp in short processing time. As these process involve less chemical doses hence {{the present research}} work was designed for the chemical recovery from the black liquors to make the waste environment friendly. In {{the first step of}} the chemical recovery of the effluents, series of experiments were conducted to determine behavior and chemistry of this straw based black liquors. Chemical composition of the <b>chemi-thermo-mechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> black liquor was determined by fractional and composite sample analysis which showed extensively low dry solids and physical and chemical properties of the black liquor tend to vary with organic to inorganic ratio of the solid contents. In the second step of the chemical recovery, desilication of the black and green liquors obtained from the <b>chemi-thermo-mechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> was conducted through the pH reduction by carbonation (80...|$|R
40|$|Activated sludge {{has been}} {{reported}} to reduce successfully both organic content and toxicity in effluents originating from <b>chemi-thermo-mechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> (CTMP) mills. The wastewater entering the treatment facility consists of a combination of waste streams derived from various stages of the process. Activated sludge treatment is sensitive to various operating conditions, including waste stream composition. Changes in operating conditions will affect the treatment process kinetics. The effect of effluent variation was examined using both mathematical modelling and experimental investigation. Mathematical modelling was used to identify the rate parameters having the most significant effect on the system when varied. Experimental studies considered three different CTMP effluents (lean white water, chip wash water and inter-stage wash) and the total mill effluent in order to investigate the actual observed effects of effluent variation. Only the inter-stage wash was found to produce an inhibitory effect, while the other two effluents produced a non-inhibitory effect...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this work}} we {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} incorporating wood fibers (bleached <b>chemi-thermo-mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> of aspen, BCTMP) on the properties of a hybrid composite material made from maleated polypropylene (MAPP) and Nanoclay (NC) or not. The effects of morphological structure of polypropylene (PP) and the molecular weight (Mw) and maleic anhydride graft level (MA%) of MAPP were also performed to evaluate the improvements of each independent factor (MAPP, Dicumyl peroxide-DCP and NC). In our case, the size of wood fiber {{had little effect on}} the impact and tensile strength. High Mw and low MA % MAPP contributes homo-PP hybrids with better performance, either impact or tensile. In addition, wood fiber gives the hybrids, based on both homo-polypropylene (homo-PP) and co-polypropylene (co-PP), without the presence of coupling agent, similar behaviors of impact and tensile strengths. However, the impact and tensile strength of the hybrids mentioned above are improved in the presence of coupling agent. NC weakens the impact strength of composites with/without the reinforcement of wood fiber, coupling agent, and DCP. It shows different behaviors of tensile with improvement of tensile for hybrids with wood fiber, coupling agent, and DCP but impartation for nanocomposites without additives. Moreover, the behavior of tensile is in concordance to the changes of elongation as well as toughness. Furthermore, DCP leads to negative effects on the impact and tensile, as well as toughness of the hybrids when fiber is present, but exhibits better resistance deformation extension which is in concordance with the increase of modulus. In addition, there is a little increase in plasticity...|$|E
40|$|The bonding of fibres {{in paper}} is {{influenced}} by environmental changes (e. g. moisture) that may cause unstable fibres to move. These movements include cell-wall swelling, fibre lifting and/or puffing that break inter-fibre bonds and lead to reduced strength and surface roughness. Fibre puffing {{is defined as the}} expansion of the lumen area as result of changes in the environment. Puffing was investigated through image analysis of scanning electron micrographs. Detailed images were obtained with samples that were embedded in resin and then etched. Puffing of fibres was then quantified by calculating the ratio of lumen area to fibre area. Stability of softwood and hardwood fibres was studied in this way, and to simulate printing, handsheets were calendered and rewetted. This method was later validated against commercial sheets. Compared to softwood, hardwood fibres were more stable and most of the handsheet properties were retained after rewetting. Mannanase and/or endoglucanase treatments resulted in improved fibre stability by increasing fibre bonding, fibrillation or fibre collapse. Mannanase improved handsheet smoothness and strength as well as fibre stability, but endoglucanase was less effective. The effect of the enzymes was more difficult to observe on hardwood fibres, because even untreated fibres were more stable under moist conditions. Thin-walled fibres such as earlywood were less stable than latewood fibres, but it responded better to mannanase treatment. Thick-walled fibres (latewood), on the other hand, were more difficult to improve with enzymes. The potential of enzymes to improve fibre stability of commercial pulp was tested on <b>chemi-thermo-mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> (CTMP) and bleached CTMP. Enzyme treatment improved fibrillation and reduced beating energy of bleached CTMP. Mannanase again resulted in the most improved fibre stability. On rejects, a lack of response to enzymes was overcome by pre-treating the pulp with alkaline peroxide. This study provided new insights into the stability of fibres with different morphology. It was also demonstrated that fibre stability can be improved with enzyme treatment and it is expected that this knowledge could have significant commercial value.
