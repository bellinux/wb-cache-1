5000|$|The single track, {{along with}} the lack of <b>crossing</b> <b>facilities</b> (as the result of the {{demolition}} of former stations) and outdated equipment were in the past a common cause of delays, so various construction projects (such as the construction of <b>crossing</b> <b>facilities</b> and the renewal of signalling equipment) were planned. The Federal government made funds of €30 million for an upgrade of the line in the period from 2003 to 2007. This work was not supported by Deutsche Bahn and was not implemented.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} station {{building was}} destroyed in 1945. In the 1950s, a large entrance building was built with border <b>crossing</b> <b>facilities.</b> This was demolished in 2011. A new station building was built.|$|E

50|$|Prior to September 2012, {{pedestrians}} {{walked from}} the U.S. to Mexico by crossing a pedestrian bridge, entering Mexico {{to the west of}} Interstate 5, and walking through a corridor leading to {{the west side of the}} crossing (Avenida de la Amistad). Then a temporary pedestrian <b>crossing</b> <b>facility</b> was built on the Mexican side on the east side of the crossing. This was replaced when in August 2015 Mexico inaugurated a new pedestrian <b>crossing</b> <b>facility</b> to the east of the northbound traffic lanes. For the first time foreigners are required to show passports when entering Mexico at the border, whereas previously they only had to be shown when entering the interior of the country.|$|R
50|$|In {{telecommunications}} {{wire wrap}} is in common high volume use in modern communications networks for cross connects of copper wiring. For example, most phone {{lines from the}} outside plant go to wire wrap panels in a central office, whether used for POTS, DSL or T1 lines. Typically at a main distribution frame Internal <b>Cross</b> <b>Facilities</b> Assignments and External <b>Cross</b> <b>Facilities</b> Assignments, are connected together via jumpers that are wire wrapped. Wire wrap is popular in telecommunications since {{it is one of}} the most secure ways to attach wires, and provides excellent and consistent data layer contact. Wirewrap panels are rated for high quality data services, including Cat 5 grade wiring. The principal competitor in this application is punch blocks, which are quicker but less secure.|$|R
50|$|The Limestone - Gillespie Portage Border Crossing is an {{international}} border crossing connecting the towns of Limestone, Maine, United States, and Grand-Sault, New Brunswick, Canada. The crossing is reached by Maine State Route 229 on the American side and by New Brunswick Route 375 on the Canadian side. The United States <b>crossing</b> <b>facilities</b> are the original facilities first built for this crossing in 1933, and were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. The Canadian facilities were built in 1984.|$|E
50|$|Since 15 December 2013, {{services}} {{on the line}} have been by operated by NordWestBahn GmbH. This has run at weekdays at hourly intervals. This represented an intensification of operations as the previous operator DB Regio had operated a two-hour regular interval service with additional Regionalbahn services for students since December 2007. Due {{to the lack of}} <b>crossing</b> <b>facilities</b> (which was only possible in Adelebsen), the journey time between Bodenfelde and Göttingen was lengthened by about six to eight minutes with the reintroduction of hourly services and now amounts to around 50 minutes.|$|E
50|$|The Belgrade-Bar railway crosses into Bosnia and Herzegovina for 9 km, {{between the}} {{stations}} at Zlatibor and Priboj, both in Serbia. There is one station, Štrpci, {{but there are}} no border <b>crossing</b> <b>facilities</b> and trains do not routinely call at the station. The abducted passengers were taken off the train, robbed and physically abused. They were then taken to the village of Visegradska banja near Višegrad in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where they were tortured and killed in a burned-out house near the river Drina. Their remains have not been found.|$|E

5000|$|A part of {{the highway}} can become unused due to changes in {{national}} borders. Some stretches of the Berlin-Königsberg autobahn are unused after the partition of East Prussia because the highway lacks a border crossing between Poland and Russia. Some small roads between different European countries didn't have border <b>crossing</b> <b>facilities</b> and were closed to traffic until those countries joined the Schengen Agreement. Some border roads are closed when the two countries have bad relations or are at war with each other, for example between Algeria-Morocco, North Korea-South Korea, Israel-Lebanon, Israel-Syria, Turkey-Armenia, and Azerbaijan-Armenia.|$|E
50|$|The Hong Kong Boundary <b>Crossing</b> <b>Facilities</b> Island (HKBCF Island) is an {{artificial}} island being constructed as the Hong Kong-side landing {{point for the}} bridge, the viaduct to the North Lantau Highway, and the tunnel to Tuen Mun New Town. With conventional land reclamation, marine mud sitting on the seafloor at the reclamation site is dredged and discarded elsewhere, causing environmental damage. But the HKBCF Island is being constructed with a non-dredge reclamation hitherto unused in Hong Kong, whereby steel circular cells in a row are pushed through the mud and filled with inert material, forming a seawall.|$|E
50|$|The Northern Dimension is {{intended}} to promote security {{and stability in the}} region, as well as helping build a safe, clean, and accessible environment for all people in the north. It aims at addressing the special regional development challenges of northern Europe. These include cold climatic conditions, long distances, wide disparities in standards of living, environmental challenges including problems with nuclear waste and wastewater management, and insufficient transport and border <b>crossing</b> <b>facilities.</b> The Northern Dimension is also intended {{to take advantage of the}} rich potential of the region, for example in terms of natural resources, economic dynamism, and a rich cultural heritage.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The type of {{pedestrians}} <b>crossing</b> <b>facility</b> {{provided for}} employees {{along the street}} Ungaran - Bawen hasn’t been same and its use isnot efficient since there are still any cases appeared either for the pedestrians crossing the street or traffic flow generally. The aim {{of the study is}} to evaluate the work of pedestrians <b>crossing</b> <b>facility,</b> that is zebra cross from the side of analysis on critical gap for finding out the opportunity in cossing the street safety and donot disturb the passing vehicles. This analisys method of critical gap is used for searching the minimum gap among vehicle passing through location in order that the pedestrian crossing the street may cross safety. Primary data taking is carried out throung field survey using handycam for watching the conflict point and time gap between vehicles passing throung the street and pefestrian who cross the street to the conflict point. From the data analisys result, the writer obtains that critical gap in study location is 2, 62 second and the opportunity degree for crossing the street safety is only 11 persons on 6. 30 to 7. 30 WIB and 7. 30 to 8. 30 as much as 29 persons. Thus, we may conclude that pedestrian <b>crossing</b> <b>facility,</b> namely zebra <b>cross</b> is not effective and for the further is that pedestrian crossing should not be in the same field.

50|$|The {{original}} station layout {{was identical}} to Ashwater, {{but after the}} First World War the <b>crossing</b> <b>facilities</b> were removed. From 15 June 1920 the Down loop {{was taken out of}} use and the signal box closed. The Second World War was to bring a reversal of fortunes when in 1943 the loop was restored and extended by a further 150 yards to enable the servicing of U.S. ammunition dumps in the surrounding countryside. At the same time the signal box was moved from the Down platform to a position in front of the booking office on the Up platform.|$|E
50|$|The scheme {{included}} {{replacing the}} Duke Street roundabout with a signalled junction with {{changes to the}} access onto/off of Back Hamlet and Duke Street, the changes to access resulted in no entry from Back Hamlet to Fore Street and Fore Hamlet meaning that traffic flows more smoothly as there are no interruptions in flow caused by vehicles entering from Back Hamlet; the other change to access is from Duke Street which now has no right turns from Duke Street onto Fore Hamlet. The pedestrian <b>crossing</b> <b>facilities</b> in the area have also been modernised including implementing bus priority measures. Cycle lanes have been added, and the pavement widened along Fore Hamlet, with a bus lane being added to Fore Hamlet.|$|E
50|$|At one stage, the Hong Kong Government had {{proposed}} {{to build the}} Yuen Long-Lantau and the Lantau-Hong Kong Island sections of Route 10. While these proposals have since been shelved, an alternative dual carriageway connection between Yuen Long / Tuen Mun and Lantau — the Tuen Mun-Chek Lap Kok Link (connecting the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Border <b>Crossing</b> <b>Facilities</b> and North Lantau Highway with Pillar Point near the Tuen Mun River Trade Terminal) and Tuen Mun Western Bypass (starting at Pillar Point and connecting to Route 10 at Tsing Chuen Wai) — has since been put forward. Construction of the Tuen Mun - Chek Lap Kok Link began in 2010 and is scheduled for completion in 2016. As of mid-2010, various alignments for the Tuen Mun Western Bypass were being considered with ongoing consultation with the Yuen Long and Tuen Mun District Councils, Heung Yee Kuk and relevant rural committees.|$|E
50|$|Another notable {{home was}} Sandgate, located in Belmore Road. This {{sandstone}} {{house was built}} circa 1870 on land granted to Simeon Pierce in 1853. It was bought by the Federal Government in the 1920s; it was then used as a Red <b>Cross</b> <b>facility</b> for First World War veterans. It was saved from demolition in 1978 and restored by Randwick Council.|$|R
50|$|The border <b>crossing</b> <b>facility</b> is only {{accessible}} by the Lo Wu Station of the East Rail Line.
