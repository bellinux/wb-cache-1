25|$|In Arabidopsis, {{which has}} been used as a model for {{understanding}} flower development, the double-flower gene AGAMOUS encodes a protein responsible for tissue specification of stamen and <b>carpel</b> flower segments. When both copies of the gene are deleted or otherwise damaged, developing flowers lack the signals to form stamen and <b>carpel</b> segments. Regions which would have formed stamens instead default to petals and the <b>carpel</b> region develops into a new flower, resulting in a recursive sepal-petal-petal pattern. Because no stamens and carpels form, the plants have no reproductive organs and are sexually sterile.|$|E
25|$|Acromegaly causes {{excessive}} secretion {{of growth}} hormones. This causes the soft tissues and bones around the <b>carpel</b> tunnel {{to grow and}} compress the median nerve.|$|E
25|$|In gymnosperms, the ovule is not {{contained}} in a <b>carpel,</b> but exposed {{on the surface of}} a dedicated support organ, such as the scale of a cone, so that the penetration of <b>carpel</b> tissue is unnecessary. Details of the process vary according to the division of gymnosperms in question. Two main modes of fertilization are found in gymnosperms. Cycads and Ginkgo have motile sperm that swim directly to the egg inside the ovule, whereas conifers and gnetophytes have sperm that are unable to swim but are conveyed to the egg along a pollen tube.|$|E
5000|$|Axile placentation: The ovary {{is divided}} into radial segments, with placentas in {{separate}} locules. Ventral sutures of <b>carpels</b> meet at {{the centre of the}} ovary. Placentae are along fused margins of <b>carpels.</b> Two or more <b>carpels.</b> (e.g. Hibiscus, Citrus, Solanum) ...|$|R
50|$|In general, the Solanaceae have a gynoecium (the {{female part}} of the flower) formed of two <b>carpels.</b> However, Melananthus has a monocarpelar gynoecium, there are three or four <b>carpels</b> in Capsicum, three to five in Nicandra, some species of Jaborosa and Trianaea and four <b>carpels</b> in Iochroma umbellatum.|$|R
50|$|Basal {{angiosperm}} groups {{tend to have}} <b>carpels</b> arranged spirally {{around a}} conical or dome-shaped receptacle. In later lineages, <b>carpels</b> tend to be in whorls.|$|R
25|$|Mutations {{affecting}} flower morphology in Arabidopsis can {{be described}} by the ABC model of flower development. In this model, genes involved in flower formation belong {{to one of three}} classes of genes: A class genes which affect sepal and petal formation, B class genes which affect petal and stamen formation, and C class genes which affect stamen and <b>carpel</b> formation. These genes are expressed in certain regions of the developing flower and are responsible for development of organs in those regions. Agamous is a C class gene, a transcription factor responsible for activating genes involved in stamen and <b>carpel</b> development.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} called pitima, or the cedro col pigolo ("citron with a pitom), because its usually {{persisting}} pitom (<b>carpel).</b> The last does not only enhance its character, but also adds Halachic promotion.|$|E
25|$|The {{fruits of}} the walnut are a type of {{accessory}} fruit known as a pseudodrupe (or drupe-like nut), the outer covering of the fruit is an involucre - in a drupe the covering would be derived from the <b>carpel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A flower {{having only}} {{functional}} stamens and lacking functional <b>carpels</b> {{is called a}} staminate flower, or (inaccurately) male. [...] A plant with only functional <b>carpels</b> is called pistillate, or (inaccurately) female.|$|R
2500|$|The gynoecium is unilocular and {{composed}} of three fused <b>carpels.</b> The ovules are numerous and attached near {{the margins of}} the <b>carpels.</b> The three stigmas are separate or initially joined at the base, but soon separating with growth of the ovary. The stigmas are commissural, meaning that the area that is receptive to pollen extends downward along the fissures where the <b>carpels</b> are joined.|$|R
5000|$|...Peas are {{normally}} self-pollinated because the stamens and <b>carpels</b> are enclosed within the petals. By removing the stamens from unripe flowers, Mendel could brush pollen from another variety on the <b>carpels</b> when they ripened.|$|R
25|$|The Coryphoideae are {{the most}} diverse {{subfamily}}, and are a paraphyletic group, meaning {{all members of the}} group share a common ancestor, but the group does not include all the ancestor's descendants. Most palms in this subfamily have palmately lobed leaves and solitary flowers with three, or sometimes four carpels. The fruit normally develops from only one <b>carpel.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{plants have}} flowers {{and these are}} the sexual organs of those plants. Flowers are usually hermaphroditic, {{producing}} both male and female gametes. The female parts, {{in the center of a}} flower, are the pistils, each unit consisting of a <b>carpel,</b> a style and a stigma. One or more of these reproductive units may be merged to form a single compound pistil. Within the carpels are ovules which develop into seeds after fertilization. The male parts of the flower are the stamens: these consist of long filaments arranged between the pistil and the petals that produce pollen in anthers at their tips. When a pollen grain lands upon the stigma on top of a carpel's style, it germinates to produce a pollen tube that grows down through the tissues of the style into the <b>carpel,</b> where it delivers male gamete nuclei to fertilize an ovule that eventually develops into a seed.|$|E
25|$|More commonly, {{the process}} of {{pollination}} requires pollinators: organisms that carry or move the pollen grains from the anther of one flower to the receptive part of the <b>carpel</b> or pistil (stigma) of another. This is biotic pollination. The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes.|$|E
50|$|In the {{subtribe}} Ochninae, and in {{the genus}} Froesia, {{the components of the}} ovary (<b>carpels)</b> are very shortly united at the base. Otherwise, the ovary in Ochnaceae is syncarpous, consisting of <b>carpels</b> that are completely fuzed.|$|R
50|$|In {{the typical}} flower (that is, in the {{majority}} of flowering plant species) each flower has both <b>carpels</b> and stamens. In some species, however, the flowers are unisexual with only <b>carpels</b> or stamens. (monoecious = both types of flowers found on the same plant; dioecious = the two types of flower found only on different plants). A flower with only stamens is called androecious. A flower with only <b>carpels</b> is called gynoecious.|$|R
25|$|Mutations in type C genes, these {{mutations}} {{affect the}} reproductive verticils, namely the stamen and the <b>carpels.</b> The A. thaliana mutant {{of this type}} is called AGAMOUS, it possesses a phenotype containing petals instead of stamen and sepals instead of <b>carpels.</b>|$|R
25|$|Each <b>carpel</b> has a broad two-crested stigma {{on a short}} style, {{and usually}} {{contains}} a single ovule. The integument – the covering {{on the outside of}} the ovule – is in the form of a long coiled tube, an unusual feature in flowering plants. The fruit which forms after fertilization is a fleshy drupe, to which the stigma remains attached.|$|E
25|$|In A. thaliana, the C {{function}} {{is derived from}} one MADS-box type gene called AGAMOUS (AG), which intervenes both {{in the establishment of}} stamen and <b>carpel</b> identity {{as well as in the}} determination of the floral meristem. Therefore, the AG mutants are devoid of androecium and gynoecium and they have petals and sepals in their place. In addition, the growth in the centre of the flower is undifferentiated, therefore the petals and sepals grow in repetitive verticils.|$|E
25|$|Aggregate fruits {{form from}} single flowers that have {{multiple}} carpels {{which are not}} joined together, i.e. each pistil contains one <b>carpel.</b> Each pistil forms a fruitlet, and collectively the fruitlets are called an etaerio. Four types of aggregate fruits include etaerios of achenes, follicles, drupelets, and berries. Ranunculaceae species, including Clematis and Ranunculus have an etaerio of achenes, Calotropis has an etaerio of follicles, and Rubus species like raspberry, have an etaerio of drupelets. Annona have an etaerio of berries.|$|E
50|$|Five <b>carpels</b> are joined, {{forming the}} spokes of a wheel some 30 cm in diameter. They are woody and densely studded with hard, blunt spines, dehiscing {{on one side}} to reveal large (25 mm long), black seeds, which are rich in oil and, after roasting, are a {{valuable}} food source. Stinging hairs, common in the Malvaceae, coat {{the interior of the}} <b>carpels</b> and these may irritate skin and eyes. The <b>carpels</b> have a superficial resemblance to the Northern Hemisphere Chestnut.|$|R

25|$|Many {{common terms}} for seeds and fruit do not {{correspond}} to the botanical classifications. In culinary terminology, a fruit is usually any sweet-tasting plant part, especially a botanical fruit; a nut is any hard, oily, and shelled plant product; and a vegetable is any savory or less sweet plant product. However, in botany, a fruit is the ripened ovary or <b>carpel</b> that contains seeds, a nut {{is a type of}} fruit and not a seed, and a seed is a ripened ovule.|$|E
25|$|A. thaliana {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied {{as a model for}} flower development. The developing flower has four basic organs: sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels (which go on to form pistils). These organs are arranged in a series of whorls: four sepals on the outer whorl, followed by four petals inside this, six stamens, and a central <b>carpel</b> region. Homeotic mutations in A. thaliana result in the change of one organ to another — {{in the case of the}} agamous mutation, for example, stamens become petals and carpels are replaced with a new flower, resulting in a recursively repeated sepal-petal-petal pattern.|$|E
25|$|The {{identity}} of the organs present in the four floral verticils {{is a consequence of}} the interaction of at least three types of gene products, each with distinct functions. According to the ABC model, functions A and C are required {{in order to determine the}} {{identity of}} the verticils of the perianth and the reproductive verticils, respectively. These functions are exclusive and the absence of one of them means that the other will determine the identity of all the floral verticils. The B function allows the differentiation of petals from sepals in the secondary verticil, as well as the differentiation of the stamen from the <b>carpel</b> on the tertiary verticil.|$|E

25|$|The {{evolution}} of the MADS-box family has been extensively studied. These genes are present even in pteridophytes, but the spread and diversity is many times higher in angiosperms. There appears {{to be quite a}} bit of pattern into how this family has evolved. Consider the {{evolution of}} the C-region gene AGAMOUS (AG). It is expressed in today's flowers in the stamens, and the <b>carpel,</b> which are reproductive organs. It's ancestor in gymnosperms also has the same expression pattern. Here, it is expressed in the strobili, an organ that produces pollens or ovules. Similarly, the B-genes' (AP3 and PI) ancestors are expressed only in the male organs in gymnosperms. Their descendants in the modern angiosperms also are expressed only in the stamens, the male reproductive organ. Thus, the same, then-existing components were used by the plants in a novel manner to generate the first flower. This is a recurring pattern in evolution.|$|E
25|$|The type genus, Asparagus, {{from which}} {{the name of the}} order is derived, was {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, with ten species. He placed Asparagus within the Hexandria Monogynia (six stamens, one <b>carpel)</b> in his sexual classification in the Species Plantarum. The majority of taxa now considered to constitute Asparagales have historically been placed within the very large and diverse family, Liliaceae. The Liliaceae family was first described by Michel Adanson in 1763, and in his taxonomic scheme he created eight sections within it, including the Asparagi with Asparagus and three other genera. The system of organising genera into families is generally credited to Antoine Laurent de Jussieu who formally described both the Liliaceae and the type family of Asparagales, the Asparagaceae, as Lilia and Asparagi, respectively, in 1789. Jussieu established the hierarchical system of taxonomy (phylogeny), placing Asparagus and related genera within a division of Monocotyledons, a class (III) of Stamina Perigynia and 'order' Asparagi, divided into three subfamilies. The use of the term Ordo (order) at that time was closer to what we now understand as Family, rather than Order. In creating his scheme he used a modified form of Linnaeus' sexual classification but using the respective topography of stamens to carpels rather than just their numbers. While De Jussieu's Stamina Perigynia also included a number of 'orders' that would eventually form families within the Asparagales such as the Asphodeli (Xanthorrhoeaceae), Narcissi (Amaryllidaceae) and Irides (Iridaceae), the remainder are now allocated to other orders. Jussieu's Asparagi soon came to be referred to as Asparagacées in the French literature (Latin: Asparagaceae). Meanwhile, the 'Narcissi' had been renamed as the 'Amaryllidées' (Amaryllideae) in 1805, by Jean Henri Jaume Saint-Hilaire, using Amaryllis as the type species rather than Narcissus, and thus has the authority attribution for Amaryllidaceae. In 1810 Brown proposed that a subgroup of Liliaceae be distinguished {{on the basis of the}} position of the ovaries and be referred to as Amaryllideae and in 1813 de Candolle described Liliacées Juss. and Amaryllidées Brown as two quite separate families.|$|E
