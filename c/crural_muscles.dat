EDL and TA + EHL were distally lengthened. Peroneal and triceps surae muscles attained a constant muscle-tendon complex length. Peroneal and triceps surae distal active force decreased significantly {{as a function}} of anterior crural muscle length, also at submaximal activation. The absolute decrease was highest for 100 Hz (peroneal muscles - 0. 87 N; triceps surae muscles - 0. 92 N), but the highest normalized decrease occurred at 10 Hz stimulation (peroneal muscles - 34 %; triceps surae muscles - 18 %). At all muscle lengths, a negative proximo-distal difference in EDL active force was present which decreased with lower firing frequencies (from - 0. 4 N at 100 Hz to - 0. 03 N at 10 Hz). The passive proximo-distal force difference attained positive values. EDL and TA + EHL length-force characteristics agree with effects of firing frequency, except for 10 Hz stimulation, where active force was higher than expected and optimum length shifted to lower muscle lengths. It is concluded that also at submaximal stimulation frequencies, extramuscular myofascial force transmission between peroneal and triceps surae muscles and antagonistic anterior <b>crural</b> <b>muscles</b> is substantial. Although lengthening of submaximally active anterior <b>crural</b> <b>muscles</b> decreases the net myofascially transmitted load on EDL, myofascial force transmission significantly alters effects of firing frequency on length-force characteristics. © The Author(s) 2008...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{lengthening}} of {{the whole}} group of anterior <b>crural</b> <b>muscles</b> (tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus muscles (TA + EHL) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL)) on myofascial interaction between synergistic EDL and TA + EHL muscles, and on myofascial force transmission between anterior crural and antagonistic peroneal muscles, were investigated. All muscles were either passive or maximally active. Peroneal muscles were kept at a constant muscle tendon complex length. Either EDL or all anterior <b>crural</b> <b>muscles</b> were lengthened so that effects of lengthening of TA + EHL could be analyzed. For both lengthening conditions, {{a significant difference in}} proximally and distally measured EDL passive and active forces, indicative of epimuscular myofascial force transmission, was present. However, added lengthening of TA + EHL significantly affected the magnitude of the active and passive load exerted on EDL. For the active condition, the direction of the epimuscular load on EDL was affected; at all muscle lengths a proximally directed load was exerted on EDL, which decreased at higher muscle lengths. Lengthening of anterior <b>crural</b> <b>muscles</b> caused a 26 % decrease in peroneal active force. Extramuscular myofascial connections are thought to be the major contributor to the EDL proximo-distal active force difference. For antagonistic peroneal complex, the added distal lengthening of a synergistic muscle increases the effects of extramuscular myofascial force transmission. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{thoracic}} diaphragm (diaphragm, as {{commonly referred}} to) {{is a complex}} skeletal muscle organ essential for support-ing respiration in mammals (De Troyer and Estenne 1988; Rowley et al. 2005). The diaphragm also exerts nonrespira-tory functions, including promoting venous return, lymphatic sieving, and gastroesophageal reflux restriction (De Troyer et al. 1981; Martin et al. 1983; Mittal 1993; Abu-Hijleh et al. 1995; Loukas et al. 2005). This diaphragm multitasking {{is supported by a}} unique anatomy. The diaphragm is divided into costal and <b>crural</b> <b>muscle</b> domains with an interceding central tendinous domain (Blair 1923; Anraku and Shargall 2009). The costal (ventral) domain is the larger component of the diaphragm and is arrayed radially from the central tendon to the ribs. The crural (posterior) domain tacks the diaphragm to the dorsal wall and the spinal column, and it wraps and provides apertures for the esophagus and the aorta. The cen-tral tendon, primarily a supportive connective tissue struc-ture, provides passage of the inferior vena cava. Whether the costal and crural domains represent two dis-tinct muscles, possibly of different embryological origins, has been a subject of debate (Pickering and Jones 2002; Babiuk et al. 2003). While the <b>crural</b> and costal <b>muscles</b> act in synchrony throughout respiration, the activities of these two muscular regions can diverge during certain events, such as swallowing and emesis (Pickering and Jones 2002). 452417 JHCXXX 10. 1369 / 0022155412452417 Stuels atz et al.

40|$|To the {{respiratory}} physiologist or anatomist the diaphragm muscle {{is of course}} the prime mover of tidal air. However, gastrointestinal physiologists are becoming increasingly aware {{of the value of}} this muscle in helping to stop gastric contents from refluxing into the oesophagus. The diaphragm should be viewed as two distinct <b>muscles,</b> <b>crural</b> and costal, which act in synchrony throughout respiration. However, the activities of these two muscular regions can diverge during certain events such as swallowing and emesis. In addition, transient <b>crural</b> <b>muscle</b> relaxations herald the onset of spontaneous acid reflux episodes. Studying the motor control of this muscular barrier may help elucidate the mechanism of these episodes. In the rat, the phrenic nerve divides into three branches before entering the diaphragm, and it is possible to sample single neuronal activity from the crural and costal branches. This review will discuss our recent findings with regard to the type of motor axons running in the phrenic nerve of the rat. In addition, we will outline our ongoing search for homologous structures in basal vertebrate groups. In particular, the pipid frogs (e. g. the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis) possess a muscular band around the oesophagus that appears to be homologous to the mammalian crural diaphragm.

It has recently been shown that injury in this model is neutrophil- and cytokine-dependent and requires the beta 2 integrin adhesion molecules CD 11 a/CD 18 and CD 11 b/CD 18. The role of selectins in events leading to injury (as determined by leakage of albumin and by hemorrhage) was assessed either {{through the use of}} blocking antibodies to L-, E- or P-selectins or by the use of oligosaccharides that are reactive with selectins.

In the case of hind limb injury involving the <b>crural</b> <b>muscle</b> mass, injury was L-selectin-dependent but independent of requirements for P- and E-selectin. Injury in both organs was blocked by the infusion of sialylated Lewis pentasaccharide, whereas sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine pentasaccharide failed to protect against injury.

Consequently, in-home accidents suffered by the elderly are also increasing. The purpose of the present research is to develop monitoring systems that prevent accidents by using physiological indices. Using such a system, we can objectively judge whether their movements are normal or unusual. In this experiment, in order to objectively determine whether a subject is possibly in an accident state, we set up two indices. The first was to determine what position the subject was in, and the other was to determine whether this posture was made voluntarily or involuntarily. In the former case, changes in <b>crural</b> <b>muscle</b> form generated by movement were measured using a strain gauge band. Three types of movement were measured in this experiment: 1) Standing-up and sitting-down; 2) stamping; and 3) going up and down a step. In order to classify movement as voluntary or involuntary, we assumed that a falling motion signifies a tumbling accident. We measured electro-cardiograph (ECG), blood pressure, and their respective fluctuations. These physiological indices are influenced by the sympathetic nervous system.

FKBP 12 is a 12 -kDa binding protein known to bind to the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + release channel [ryanodine receptor (RyR 1) ] and {{plays an important}} role in excitation-contraction coupling. To assess the effects of FKBP 12 deficiency on muscle injury and recovery, we measured anterior <b>crural</b> <b>muscle</b> (tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus muscles) strength in skeletal muscle-specific FKBP 12 -deficient and wild-type (WT) mice before and after a single bout of 150 eccentric contractions, as well as before and after the performance of six injury bouts. Histological damage of the tibialis anterior muscle was assessed after injury. Body weight and peak isometric and eccentric torques were lower in FKBP 12 -deficient mice compared with WT mice. There were no differences between FKBP 12 -deficient and WT mice in preinjury peak isometric and eccentric torques when normalized to body weight, and no differences in the relative decreases in eccentric torque with a single or multiple injury bouts. After a single injury bout, FKBP 12 -deficient mice had less initial strength deficits and recovered faster (especially females) than WT mice, despite no differences in the degree of histological damage. After multiple injury bouts, FKBP 12 -deficient mice recovered muscle strength faster than WT mice and exhibited significantly less histological muscle damage than WT mice. In summary, FKBP 12 deficiency results in less initial strength deficits and enhanced recovery from single (especially females) and repeated bouts of injury than WT mice...|$|R
40|$|Purpose] The aim of {{this study}} was to compare toe grip {{strength}} and muscle activity during toe grip strength exertion according to the presence/absence of an ankle immobilization belt and to examine the relationship between the differences in muscle activity and toe grip strength. [Subjects] The Subjects were 13 healthy young women. [Methods] We measured toe grip strength and muscle activity during toe grip strength exertion in the presence and absence of an ankle immobilization belt using electromyography. Activity in the following leg muscles was recorded: rectus femoris, biceps femoris, medial head of the gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior. We then calculated the percent integrated electromyography during toe gripping. [Results] Toe grip strength and percent integrated electromyography of the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle were significantly higher with ankle belt immobilization compared with without ankle belt immobilization. In addition, in the presence of ankle belt immobilization, the percent integrated electromyography of the tibialis anterior muscle and medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle demonstrated a positive correlation with toe grip strength (r = 0. 75 and r = 0. 65, respectively). [Conclusion] These findings suggest that greater toe grip strength could be exerted in the presence of ankle belt immobilization.

40|$|Epimuscular myofascial force {{transmission}} (EMFT) {{is a major}} determinant of muscle force exerted, as well as length range of force exertion. Therefore, EMFT is of importance in remedial surgery performed, e. g., in spastic paresis. We aimed to test the following hypotheses: (1) muscle lengthening surgery (involving preparatory dissection (PD) and subsequent proximal aponeurotomy (AT)) affects the target muscle force exerted at its distal and proximal tendons differentially, (2) forces of non-operated synergistic muscles are affected as well, (3) PD causes some of these effects. In three conditions (control, post-PD, and post-AT exclusively on m. extensor digitorum longus (EDL)), forces exerted by rat anterior <b>crural</b> <b>muscles</b> were measured simultaneously. Our results confirm hypotheses (1 - 2), and hypothesis (3) in part: Reduction of EDL maximal force differed by location (i. e. 26. 3 % when tested distally and 44. 5 % when tested proximally). EDL length range of active force exertion increased only distally. Force reductions were shown also for non-operated tibialis anterior (by 11. 9 %), as well as for extensor hallucis longus (by 8. 4 %) muscles. In tibialis anterior only, part of the force reduction (4. 9 %) is attributable to PD.

40|$|In this study, the {{hind legs}} 2 ̆ 7 muscle, {{one of the}} {{important}} parts of chicken body for meat production, was compared quantitatively with its weight among various breeds and sexes. Males and females of Rhode Island Red (RIR), Barred Plymouth Rock (BPR), White Leghorn (WL) and males of White Cornish (WC) were used from 2 to 18 - 19 weeks of age. Weighing of skeletal muscle was done in the hind legs 2 ̆ 7 part and its three different subparts (pelvis, femur, crus). Regression equations of males and females of each breed were calculated between the muscle weight of these parts and live weight or total muscle weight. And the equations were applied to the study of ability of meat production. The results were as follows: Specific individual ability of meat production in the hind legs 2 ̆ 7 part and its three subparts was observed among all breeds and sexes. This individual ability was controlled by two factors; one was the rate of increase of the live weight, and the other was the rate of increase of the individual muscle percentage weight against the live weight. In males, RIR showed the highest value of muscle percentage weight of all breeds, and high ability of meat production in the hind legs 2 ̆ 7 part. When the muscle percentage weight was compared between WC and RIR at the same live weight, WC showed always lower value than RIR. But WC was the better meat producer than RIR in the hind legs 2 ̆ 7 part, because of its rapid rate of increase of live weight. BPR showed the highest value of muscle percentage weight until 1 kg of live weight. WL exhibited the worst ability of meat production of the hind legs 2 ̆ 7 part, because of both factors, namely low value of muscle percentage weight and slow rate of increase of live weight. In females, the muscle percentage weight did not show any differences between RIR, BPR and WL in the hind legs 2 ̆ 7 part, and also between sexes. The percentage weight of hind legs 2 ̆ 7 muscle to total muscle weight did not change in WC males, but it increased in other breed males and females. These results suggest that the ability of meat production of hind legs 2 ̆ 7 part is better than that of other parts in the body. When hind legs 2 ̆ 7 part was divided into three subparts, the ability of meat production of each subpart was also discussed. The percentage weight of <b>crural</b> <b>muscle</b> to live weight increased conspicuously in RIR.

Methods: We performed Bayesian MUNE paired with histological counts of motor neurons in the lumbar spinal cord of wild-type mice and transgenic SOD 1 G 93 A mice that show progressive weakness over time. We evaluated the number of acetylcholine endplates that were innervated by a presynaptic nerve. Results: In wild-type mice, the motor unit number in the gastrocnemius muscle estimated by Bayesian MUNE was approximately half the number of motor neurons {{in the region of}} the spinal cord that contains the cell bodies of the motor neurons supplying the hindlimb <b>crural</b> flexor <b>muscles.</b> In SOD 1 G 93 A mice, motor neuron numbers declined over time. This was associated with motor endplate denervation at the end-stage of disease. Conclusion: The number of motor neurons in the spinal cord of wild-type mice is proportional to the number of motor units estimated by Bayesian MUNE.

40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} {{relationship}} between Bayesian MUNE and histological motor neuron counts in wild-type mice and in an animal model of ALS. Methods We performed Bayesian MUNE paired with histological counts of motor neurons in the lumbar spinal cord of wild-type mice and transgenic SOD 1 G 93 A mice that show progressive weakness over time. We evaluated the number of acetylcholine endplates that were innervated by a presynaptic nerve. Results In wild-type mice, the motor unit number in the gastrocnemius muscle estimated by Bayesian MUNE was approximately half the number of motor neurons {{in the region of}} the spinal cord that contains the cell bodies of the motor neurons supplying the hindlimb <b>crural</b> flexor <b>muscles.</b> In SOD 1 G 93 A mice, motor neuron numbers declined over time. This was associated with motor endplate denervation at the end-stage of disease. Conclusion The number of motor neurons in the spinal cord of wild-type mice is proportional to the number of motor units estimated by Bayesian MUNE. In SOD 1 G 93 A mice, there is a lower number of estimated motor units compared to the number of spinal cord motor neurons at the end-stage of disease, and this is associated with disruption of the neuromuscular junction.

40|$|Aim: Effects of submaximal {{stimulation}} frequencies on myofascial {{force transmission}} were investigated for rat anterior <b>crural</b> <b>muscles</b> with all motor units activated. - Methods: Tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus (TAEHL) muscles were kept at constant muscle-tendon complex length, but extensor digitorum longus muscle (EDL) was lengthened distally. All muscles were activated simultaneously at 10, 20, 30 and 100 Hz within an intact anterior crural compartment. - Results: At lower frequencies, significant proximo-distal EDL force differences exist. Absolute EDL proximo-distal active force differences were highest at 100 Hz (Î”Fdist-prox = 0. 4 N). However, the normalized difference was highest at 10 Hz (Î”Fdist-prox = 30 %Fdist). Firing-frequency dependent shifts of the ascending limb of the EDL length-force curve to higher lengths were confirmed for a muscle within an intact compartment, although effects of firing frequency assessed at proximal and distal EDL tendons differed quantitatively. As EDL was lengthened distally, TAEHL distal isometric active force decreased progressively. The absolute decrease was highest for 100 Hz (Î”Ffrom initial = - 0. 25 N). However, the highest normalized decrease {{was found for}} 10 Hz stimulation (Î”Ffrom initial = - 40 %). - Conclusions: At submaximal stimulation frequencies, myofascial force transmission is present and the fraction of force transmitted myofascially increases with progressively lower firing frequencies. Evidently, the stiffness of epimuscular myofascial paths of force transmission decreases less than the stiffness of serial sarcomeres and myotendinous pathways. It is concluded that low firing frequencies as encountered in vivo enhance {{the relative importance of}} epimuscular myofascial force transmission with respect to myotendinous force transmission...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that epimuscular myofascial force transmission occurs between deep flexor muscles of the rat and their antagonists: previously unstudied mechanical effects of length changes of deep flexors on the anterior <b>crural</b> <b>muscles</b> (i. e., extensor digitorum longus (EDL), as well as tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus muscle complex (TA + EHL) and peroneal (PER) muscles were assessed experimentally. These muscles or muscle groups were kept at constant length, whereas, distal length changes were imposed on deep flexor (DF) muscles before performing isometric contractions. Distal forces of all muscle-tendon complexes were measured simultaneously, in addition to EDL proximal force. Distal lengthening of DF caused substantial significant effects on its antagonistic muscles: (1) increase in proximal EDL total force (maximally 19. 2 %), (2) decrease in distal EDL total (maximally 8. 4 %) and passive (maximally 49 %) forces, (3) variable proximo-distal total force differences indicating net proximally directed epimuscular myofascial loads acting on EDL at lower DF lengths and net distally directed loads at higher DF lengths, (4) decrease in TA + EHL total (maximally 50 %) and passive (maximally 66. 5 %) forces and (5) decrease in PER total force (maximally 51. 3 %). It is concluded that substantial inter-antagonistic epimuscular myofascial force transmission occurs between deep flexor, anterior crural and peroneal muscles. In the light of our present results and recently reported evidence on inter-antagonistic interaction between anterior crural, peroneal and triceps surae muscles, we concluded that epimuscular myofascial force transmission is capable of causing major effects within the entire lower leg of the rat. Implications of such large scale myofascial force transmission are discussed and expected to be crucial to muscle function in healthy, as well as pathological conditions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether eccentric contraction-induced muscle injury causes impaired plasmalemmal action potential conduction, which could explain the injury-induced excitation-contraction coupling failure. Mice were chronically implanted with stimulating electrodes on the left common peroneal nerve and with electromyographic (EMG) electrodes on the left tibialis anterior (TA) muscle. The left anterior <b>crural</b> <b>muscles</b> of anaesthetized mice were stimulated to perform 150 eccentric (ECC) (n = 12 mice) or 150 concentric (CON) (n = 11 mice) contractions. Isometric torque, EMG root mean square (RMS) and M-wave mean and median frequencies were measured before, immediately after, and at 1, 3, 5 and 14 days after the protocols. In parallel experiments, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) concentration was measured in TA muscles to determine whether the excitation failure elicited a denervation-like response. Immediately after the ECC protocol, torque was reduced by 47 – 89 %, while RMS was reduced by 9 – 21 %; the RMS decrement was not different from that observed for the CON protocol, which did not elicit large torque deficits. One day later, both ECC and CON RMS had returned to baseline values and did not change over the next 2 weeks. However, torque production by the ECC group showed a slow recovery over that time and was still depressed by 12 – 30 % after 2 weeks. M-wave mean and median frequencies were not affected by performance of either protocol. AChR concentration was elevated by 79 and 368 % at 3 and 5 days, respectively, after the ECC protocol; AChR concentration had returned to control levels 2 weeks after the protocol. At the time of peak AChR concentration in the ECC protocol muscles (i. e. 5 days), AChR concentration in CON protocol muscles was not different from the control level. In conclusion, these data demonstrate no major role for impaired plasmalemmal action potential conduction in the excitation-contraction coupling failure induced by eccentric contractions. Additionally, a muscle injured by eccentric contractions shows a response in AChR concentration similar to a transiently denervated muscle...|$|E
40|$|Tactile {{stimulation}} of the pharyngo-laryngeal region elicits severe gagging, which is characterized by simultaneous contraction of the costal diaphragm and abdominal muscles. While severe gagging is associated with problems in oral feeding in children, routine dental treatment and gastrointestinal endoscopy, {{little is known about}} the neural mechanism of this reflex. In the present study using decerebrate rats, we observed dynamic changes in the activities of the costal and <b>crural</b> diaphragm, abdominal <b>muscles,</b> and infrahyoid muscles, and in pharyngeal and esophageal pressure during severe gagging, and determined the most suitable {{stimulation of}} the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) for induction. High-frequency {{stimulation of the}} SLN at 50 Hz (30 μA, 50 pulses) elicited severe gagging in all of the rats. Severe gagging had the following characteristics: 1) simultaneous activation of the costal diaphragm and abdominal muscles, but relaxation of the crural diaphragm; 2) infrahyoid muscle contraction and temporary decrease in pharyngeal pressure; 3) retrograde contraction of esophageal striated muscles; and 4) decrease of blood pressure, which was mediated by a vagal muscarinic pathway. The identification of characteristic changes in respiratory muscles and autonomic responses should assist future studies on the mechanism of severe gagging...|$|R
40|$|Evidence on epimuscular myofascial force {{transmission}} (EMFT) was shown for undissected muscle in situ. We hypothesize that global length changes of gastrocnemius muscle-tendon complex in vivo will cause sizable and heterogeneous local strains within all {{muscles of the}} human lower leg. Our goal is to test this hypothesis. A method was developed and validated using high-resolution 3 D magnetic resonance image sets and Demons nonrigid registration algorithm for performing large deformation analyses. Calculation of strain tensors per voxel in human muscles in vivo allowed quantifying local heterogeneous tissue deformations and volume changes. After hip and knee movement (D knee angle ∼ 25 deg) but without any ankle movement, local lengthening within m. gastrocnemius was shown to occur simultaneously with local shortening (maximally by + 34. 2 % and - 32. 6 %, respectively) at different locations. Moreover, similar local strains occur also within other muscles, despite being kept at constant muscle-tendon complex length. This is shown for synergistic m. soleus and deep flexors, {{as well as for}} antagonistic anterior <b>crural</b> and peroneal <b>muscle</b> groups: minimum peak lengthening and shortening equaled 23. 3 % and 25. 54 %, respectively despite global isometric conditions. These findings confirm our hypothesis and show that in vivo, muscles are in principle not independent mechanically. Copyright © 2013 by ASME...|$|R
40|$|As {{the fastest}} long-endurance runner, the bipedal ostrich (Struthio camelus) was {{selected}} as a prime model organism to investigate the physical attributes underlying this advanced locomotor performance. A specific integrative approach combining morphological, morphometric, kinematic and pedobarographic methods was developed. The comparative morphometric analysis of the hind limbs of all ratite species revealed that leg segment ratios in the ostrich are the most specialised for efficient locomotion, especially when taking into consideration its unique supra-jointed toe posture. In addition, the <b>crural</b> <b>muscle</b> mass is more concentrated towards the hip joint in the ostrich than in its ratite relatives. According to the Law of the Pendulum, this concentration of mass towards the pivot point – {{in concert with the}} relatively longest and lightest distal leg elements – represents a mechanical optimisation of limb swinging capacities. While musculature clearly drives limb movement, the passive guidance and constraint of motion range by ligamentous structures combined with joint surface contours allows a high level of energy output efficiency during all stages of locomotion and ensures articular stability during slow locomotion as well as high-speed performance. So far, the influence of these passive effects in locomotion has been largely ignored. In order to quantify the guiding effect of these anatomical structures, kinematic data of adult ostriches during walking and running were collected. Subsequently, these data were compared with results from manual manipulation experiments performed with the limbs of anatomical specimens – both fully intact and with muscles removed – leaving only the ligament system intact. This investigation revealed that the range of motion among leg segments was nearly identical in all sample groups, especially in regard to maximum extension values. This indicates that ostrich hind limb dynamics are managed to a significant degree by passive elements that ensure a controlled swing-plane with minimal deviation from an optimal attitude. Further dissections allowed some of these features to be described in detail, with an emphasis on functional-morphological examination of the intertarsal joint. The intertarsal joint contains a significant locking mechanism, briefly mentioned in historical documents, but described and functionally analysed herein for the first time. The functional examination qualified the interplay of three collateral ligaments, the tendinous M. fibularis brevis and specific joint surface protrusions as the basis for this effect which remains absent in smaller ground-dwelling bird species. A proximate quantification, based on comparative morphological and kinematic data, revealed function of Struthio's passively locked intertarsal joint as a potent stabiliser in the supporting limb during the ground-contact phase of locomotion. During stance phase, it is crucial that the supporting limb is stabilised internally and in relation to the substrate. As yet, no study exists concerning use and loading of the actual ground contact elements. The toes must absorb body mass, guarantee stable grip and provide energetic push off. Obvious specialisations of the ostrich's phalangeal complex include toe reduction (leaving only 3 rd and 4 th toe), claw reduction (only at 3 rd toe) and a permanently elevated metatarsophalangeal joint. Using a relatively new methodology to examine in vivo toe function, pedobarography was employed on specifically trained ostriches to allow extensive collection of Centre of Pressure (CoP) and load distribution (LD) data. In contrast to a relatively predictable CoP trajectory at all speeds, conspicuous LD differences were observed between slow and fast trials. Load was distributed rather inconsistently during walking, while a typical tripod-like toe-print occurred in all running trials to presumably deliver additional stability during the comparatively short stance phase. Significant grip is provided by the highly directed impact of the 3 rd toe claw-tip, suggesting its important function as a positional anchor during running. Pedobarographic analysis further showed the importance of the 4 th toe as an outrigger to maintain balance, rendering a future reduction highly unlikely. In conclusion, the application of interdisciplinary methodologies allowed comprehensive data collection and integration of the model organism within its ecological context. The data gained from this thesis increases the current knowledge about ostrich locomotion by identifying distinct structural attributes as essential elements for extreme cursorial performance. The present data may alter existing models for calculation of the metabolic cost of terrestrial locomotion and aid in the reconstruction of theropod locomotion, as these branch sciences often overlook the important role of ligaments and passively-coupled motion cycles in reducing the cost of locomotion...|$|R

In I-period (0 - 2 weeks old), the shoulder girdle 2 ̆ 7 s, the humeral and the antebrachial parts grew and developed very rapidly, the dorsal and caudal parts intermediately, and the other parts more slowly than those parts in both sexes. 2. In II-period (2 - 22 weeks old), the pelvic, the femoral, the crural and the dorso-caudal parts of the male grew and developed more rapidly than the other parts. The cervical and the abdominal parts of both sexes grew and developed more slowly than the other. Growth {{and development of the}} other parts of the female became more rapidly in the following order: the pelvic, the dorso-caudal, the shoulder girdle 2 ̆ 7 s, the femoral, the humeral and the antebrachial parts. 3. In III-period (22 - 26 weeks old), the pelvic, the femoral, the crural and the dorso-caudal parts grew and developed very rapidly, and the cervical and the abdominal parts also rapidly in the male. But in the female only the abdominal part grew and developed rapidly, and the other parts did not grow, or did only a little. 4. In IV-period (after 26 weeks old), muscle weight of each part of the 32 weeks old was little heavier than that of the 26 weeks old in the male. 5. From these results mentioned above, nine parts were divided into four groups as follows: The first group (the shoulder girdle 2 ̆ 7 s, the humeral and the antebrachial parts) : During I-period these parts grew and developed very rapidly, and during II- and III-period also rapidly. But there was nothing remarkable about the growth and development of these parts 2 ̆ 7 muscle of the male during II- and III-period. The second group (the dorso-caudal part) : During I-period this part grew and developed intermediately, and very rapidly during II- and III-period. The third A-group (the pelvic, the femoral and the crural parts) : During I-period these parts grew and developed more slowly, but very rapidly during II- and III-period. And unique growth and development of these parts were observed during III-period only in the male. The third B-group (the cervical and the abdominal part) : During I- and II-period these parts grew and developed more slowly than any other parts in both sexes. But during III-period, the cervical part grew and developed more rapidly only in the male. The abdominal part grew and developed more rapidly in both sexes, particularly most rapidly of all parts in the female during III-period.

Those were three large parts, namely a body stem’s, a forelimbs’ and a hind legs’ parts. These three parts were further subdivided into nine small parts altogether, that is, the body stem 2 ̆ 7 s into a cervical and a dorsocaudal parts, the forelimbs 2 ̆ 7 into an abdominal, a shoulder girdle 2 ̆ 7 s, a humeral and an antebrachial parts, the hind legs 2 ̆ 7 into a pelvic, a femoral and a <b>crural</b> parts exactly. <b>Muscle</b> weight of each part was weighed in {{the left side of}} the body at fourteen times between zero and thirty-one weeks of age. The results compared the postnatal growth of the skeletal muscle among parts or between sexes were as follows: 1. There were four periods in the postnatal growth of the skeletal muscle between zero and 31 weeks of age. Every period except the fourth was subdivided into two periods, the former and the latter halves. 2. The skeletal muscle developed very rapidly from zero to two weeks of age, particularly in the shoulder girdle’s, humeral and antebrachial parts. 3. Concerning with the percentage of the muscle weight to the live weight, the forelimbs’ part only showed a rapid rate of increase from zero to two weeks of age. Sex-difference of percentage of the muscle weight was led to an apparent increase after sex-maturing in each part. 4. It was confirmed, especially in the male, that the postnatal growth period of the skeletal muscle was composed of two cycles; these cycles have two peaks, the one appeared at the 9 - 12 weeks of age, and the-ether appeared at the 15 - 18 or 18 - 21 weeks of age. 5. The small nine parts were grouped into three classes according to the growth rate between zero and two weeks, one of them was further subdivided into two groups according to the growth after two weeks of age. 6. It was clearly showed that the grading with age of chicken in the market was closely related to the muscle growth or the changes of the muscle weight distribution with age and the difference of it between sexes. The grading of chicken in the market is very reasonable. 本研究ではBPR種を用いて体各部位骨格筋の成長を検討した. その際,計測された体各部位は,大割したときの体幹部,前肢部ならびに後肢部の 3 部位と,さらに,体幹部を頸部と背および尾部に,前肢部を腹部,前肢帯部,上腕部ならびに前腕部に,後肢部を二部,大腿部ならびに下腿部に小割したときの合計 9 部位である. これらの各部位の骨格筋重量を求め,各部位骨格筋の成長を比較検討した結果の大要は次のとおりであつた. 1. 骨格筋の成長過程に 4 期が区分され,さらに,第I,IIならびにIII期は前半と後半に分けられた. 2. 第I期(0 ～ 2 週齢) での骨格筋成蔓には著しいものがあり,特に前肢帯部,上腕部ならびに前腕部等の成長が著しかつた. 3. 骨格筋の生体重比(％) は第I期(0 ～ 2 週齢) において前肢部のみが著しい増加を示した. また,性成熟期には雌雄間の差が判然となつた. 4. 骨格筋の成長は周期的変化を示し,特に雄において判然としていた. 5. 小割した 9 部位を第I期(0 ～ 2 週齢) の骨格筋成長の相違によつて 3 つのグループに区分し,さらに,その後の成長によつて,その中の 1 つのグループを 2 つに区分した. 6. 市場での食鶏の区分と骨格筋成長の変化との間には密接な関係があることがわかり,市場での食鶏区分の正当性を裏付けた...|$|R
