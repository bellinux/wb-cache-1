50|$|In 1917, the Nationalist {{government}} in Victoria introduced <b>compulsory</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> before the 1917 state election. This enabled the factions {{in the party}} to field competing candidates without splitting the vote by keeping preferences within the party.|$|R
50|$|The 1935 New South Wales state {{election}} {{was held on}} 11 May 1935. This {{election was}} {{for all of the}} 90 seats in the 31st New South Wales Legislative Assembly and was conducted in single member constituencies with <b>compulsory</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>voting.</b>|$|R

The {{election was}} {{for all of the}} 90 seats in the Legislative Assembly.|$|R
50|$|The 1930 New South Wales state {{election}} {{was held on}} 25 October 1930.

50|$|The 1927 {{election}} was fought on single Member districts, but using optional <b>preferential</b> <b>voting,</b> a provision {{imposed on the}} Lang Government by the Legislative Council. The Bavin Coalition Government that followed introduced <b>compulsory</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> for the 1930 election. This system remained in place until changes to the Constitution in 1980 re-introduced optional <b>preferential</b> <b>voting.</b> Both single-Member districts and optional <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> are now entrenched in the State’s Constitution and a referendum is required to change them.|$|R
50|$|The 1950 New South Wales state {{election}} {{was held on}} 17 June 1950. It was conducted in single member constituencies with <b>compulsory</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> and was held on boundaries created at a 1949 redistribution. The {{election was}} {{for all of the}} 94 seats in the Legislative Assembly, which was an increase of 4 seats since the previous election.|$|R
5000|$|The 1932 New South Wales state {{election}} [...] {{was held}} on 11 June 1932. This election was {{for all of the}} 90 seats in the 30th New South Wales Legislative Assembly and it was conducted in single member constituencies with <b>compulsory</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>voting.</b> It was a landslide victory for the UAP/Country Party coalition of Bertram Stevens, which had a majority of 42 in the Assembly.|$|R
50|$|Queensland used an {{optional}} preferential {{version of the}} instant-runoff system in single-member electorates, in 2016 <b>compulsory</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> was readopted. The election was conducted by the Electoral Commission of Queensland, an independent body answerable to Parliament. In Queensland, a parliamentary term was for a maximum of three years, measured from the day set {{for the return of}} the electoral writs, {{as a result of the}} 2016 referendum in future Queensland will have fixed four year terms. The previous state election was held on 24 March 2012.|$|R
50|$|The 1968 New South Wales state {{election}} {{was held on}} 24 February 1968. It was conducted in single member constituencies with <b>compulsory</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> and was held on boundaries created at a 1966 redistribution. The {{election was}} {{for all of the}} 94 seats in the Legislative Assembly. The Liberal Party of Australia, led by Premier Bob Askin, in Coalition with the Country Party of Deputy Premier Charles Cutler, was elected for a second term—the first time that a non-Labor government had been reelected since before World War II.|$|R
50|$|The {{breaking}} {{point for the}} Nationalist government was Premier Alexander Peacock's decision to increase rail fares to rural areas. The party split into a pro-Peacock Ministerial faction (mostly composed of city-based members), and an opposition faction led by John Bowser, composed mostly of country members. The two factions ran candidates {{against each other in}} most Nationalist seats. This did not effectively split the vote, as Victoria had introduced <b>compulsory</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> for this election, and most of the preferences resulting from multiple Nationalist candidates were kept within the party. After the election, on 29 November, the rural faction of the Nationalist government led by Bowser won control of the party, ousting Peacock.|$|R
50|$|Elections {{were held}} {{in the state of}} Western Australia on 3 October 1911 to elect 50 members to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly. The Labor Party, led by Opposition Leader John Scaddan, {{defeated}} the conservative Ministerialist government led by Premier Frank Wilson. In doing so, Scaddan achieved Labor's first absolute majority {{on the floor of the}} Assembly and, with 68% of the seats (34 of 50), set a record for Labor's biggest majority in Western Australia. The record would stand for nearly 106 years until Labor won 69% of seats (41 of 59) at the 2017 election. The result came as something of a surprise to many commentators and particularly to the Ministerialists, as they went to an election for the first time as a single grouping backed by John Forrest's Western Australian Liberal League, under a new system of <b>compulsory</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> and new electoral boundaries both of which had been passed by Parliament earlier in the year despite ardent Labor opposition.|$|R
50|$|Nicklin's first {{priority}} was {{to reverse the}} zonal electoral system in favour of his Government. Nicklin's redistribution was fairer than Hanlon's, but it still favoured the Country Party. The far-western region went down from five seats to three, and the provincial cities (which had traditionally voted ALP) were separated from their hinterlands, in which new Country Party seats were created. As a result, Liberals gained new seats in Brisbane, and in return they agreed not to contest the zonal electoral system, {{despite the fact that}} it allowed the Country Party to be the senior coalition partner even if it won fewer votes than the Liberal Party (which it did after 1966). Another electoral reform in the form of <b>compulsory</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> was introduced in 1960, when it became clear that the QLP no longer posed a threat, and that QLP voters were likely to give their preferences to a Country-Liberal coalition over the ALP in any event. Largely on the strength of QLP preferences, the Coalition scored a healthy four-seat swing in the 1960 state election—the first time since 1912 that a non-Labor government had been reelected. The QLP eventually became the Queensland branch of the Democratic Labor Party.|$|R
40|$|Australia {{developed}} {{parliamentary democracy}} without any {{struggle for independence}} as colonial governments became self-governing in the 1850 s and a federal nation was created in 1901. This article explores, among other things, the implications of {{those parts of the}} Australian system of government that differ from the British model from which it emerged. These include a written constitution, a federal structure, a powerful Senate, <b>compulsory</b> and <b>preferential</b> <b>voting,</b> highly disciplined parties, albeit with a shrinking membership base, and Prime Ministers highly vulnerable to internal party revolt. These factors have all shaped the way that politics is fought and parliamentary government is organised in Australia. No Full Tex...|$|R
50|$|The 1916 Labor split {{occurred}} {{over the issue of}} World War I conscription in Australia which saw pro-conscription Labor members expelled from the party and running as National Labor candidates at the 1917 election. That election also saw the emergence of the Victorian Farmers' Union (the forerunner of the Country Party) as a party. There was also a split in the Nationalist party into rural and city factions and both factions fielded their own candidates. However, Victoria introduced <b>compulsory</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> before this election, and most of the preferences resulting from multiple Nationalist candidates were kept within the party. At that election, of the 65 seats, the pro-Ministerial city faction of the Nationalists won 13 seats, while the rural faction won 27. Labor won 18 seats, National Labor won 3 and the VFU won 4. After the election the rural Nationalist faction took control of the party, ousting Premier Alexander Peacock. The Nationalists reunited under Bowser. Elmslie died in 1918 and Prendergast returned to the party's leadership. At the 1920 election Labor won 20 seats to the Nationalists' 30. VFU became a force, holding {{the balance of power in}} the Legislative Assembly with 13 seats, a position it held until 1952. In 1920, it supported the conservative Nationalist government. In 1921, the VFU voted with Labor against the Nationalist government when it abolished the compulsory wheat pool operating in the state, leading to a dissolution of Parliament and the 1921 election, which maintained the same balance of power.|$|R

50|$|Since the 1918 Swan {{by-election}} which Labor unexpectedly {{won with}} the largest primary vote, a predecessor of the Liberals, the Nationalist Party of Australia, changed the lower house voting system from first-past-the-post to full-preference <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> as of the subsequent 1919 election which has remained in place since, allowing the Coalition parties to safely contest the same seats.

5000|$|IRV (in Australia called <b>preferential</b> <b>voting)</b> was {{introduced}} for House of Representatives elections in Australia after the Swan by-election in October 1918, when the conservative Country Party, representing small farmers, split the non-Labor vote in conservative country areas, allowing Labor candidates {{to win on}} a first-past-the-post vote then in place. The conservative Nationalist government of Billy Hughes introduced <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> to enable the Coalition parties to field candidates in the same electorates without putting Coalition seats at risk. [...] It was first used at the Corangamite by-election on 14 December 1918, and nationwide at the 1919 election. <b>Preferential</b> <b>voting</b> continued to benefit the Coalition until the 1990 election, when {{for the first time}} the Labor Bob Hawke government obtained a net benefit from <b>preferential</b> <b>voting.</b>|$|R

40|$|There will be state {{elections}} in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland {{over the coming}} few months and {{in each of these}} states there is public discussion of whether their <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> systems would cope with an election at which there could be three, rather than two, major parties. In Victoria, where a full preferential count is used, voters must mark a preference for every candidate and the Liberal Party has been internally divided over whether to direct its supporters to out Labor or the Greens last on their ballot papers. Optional <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> would allow the parties to avoid that question, but in New South Wales and Queensland where optional preferential is used, the state Labor Parties are worried that they will lose seats if Greens voters Just Vote One and do not pass on their preferences. So optional <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> is being reviewed in Queensland and may be examined in New South Wales too. Like Victoria (and the Commonwealth) South Australia uses full <b>preferential</b> <b>voting,</b> but an optional preferential system is suggested here from time to time. So this paper looks at why <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> was introduced into South Australia’s electoral system, as {{one of a series of}} electoral changes that took place during the first half of the twentieth century. The paper considers the way that <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> has operated with other components of the electoral system, including single-member electorates, to shape politics in this State into a two party contest and to maintain it in that form. Then the paper uses the current election preparations in Victoria to look at the stresses on full <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> systems that arise when a political system seems to be moving from a two-party to a three-party system. The paper’s final section looks at optional <b>preferential</b> <b>voting,</b> which could be viewed as a solution to the parties’ problem of deciding where to direct their preferences in a three-way contest. New South Wales and Queensland both use optional <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> at state elections, and voters in those states can vote for just one candidate or can show preferences. At least in Queensland, optional <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> has not collapsed into a first-past-the-post system, and between 30 % and half of all voters across Queensland do still complete a full ballot, especially in marginal seats. While optional <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> might solve the major parties’ preferencing dilemma, it carries its own problems: it is less successful than full <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> at amalgamating support, so Labor governments in both Queensland and New South Wales are currently worried that Greens candidates could reduce Labor’s first preference vote and then refuse to send their preferences back again. From time to time an optional preferential ballot is advocated in South Australia. Introducing it here would require a bigger change than was needed interstate, because South Australia’s electoral districts boundary redistribution process incorporates a fairness requirement which effectively requires a full preferential ballot...|$|R

40|$|<b>Preferential</b> <b>voting</b> {{has been}} {{introduced}} {{in a number of}} proportional election systems over the last 20 years, mainly as a means to increase the accountability of individual politicians. But most of these reforms have been criticized as blatant failures. In this paper, we discover a genuinely new fact, which calls into question this negative evaluation. We show that <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> in a general election can operate as a stand-in internal primary election for top party positions. To do this, we rely on a unique data set from four waves of Swedish local elections, which includes every nominated politician in each of 290 municipal assemblies. We use a natural-experiment (regression-discontinuity) approach to estimate the causal effect of winning the most <b>preferential</b> <b>votes</b> on becoming the local party leader, and find that narrow 'list winners' are over 50 percent more likely to become party leaders than their runner-ups. Comparing across politicians, the effect of list winning is the strongest for competent politicians, who {{are also more likely to}} draw <b>preferential</b> <b>votes</b> than mediocre politicians. Comparing across municipalities, the response to narrow list winning is the strongest within unthreatened governing majorities, where voters also use the <b>preferential</b> <b>vote</b> the most frequently...|$|R
40|$|The <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> {{system used}} in Australia has {{received}} limited attention there in recent times, but considerably more interest internationally, {{where it is}} often known as the ‘alternative vote’. While the academic literature also usually refers to the ‘alternative vote’, this article will follow the local nomenclature {{of most of the}} countries cited — including Australia, Papua New Guinea and Sri Lanka — where the terms ‘preferential vote’ and ‘preferential voting’ are invariably used. The article begins by giving a brief overview of the history of <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> in Australia (where it has been a feature of national elections to the House of Representatives since 1918) and the abortive attempts to introduce the system in Great Britain and New Zealand. It examines the ‘political engineering’ potential of the <b>preferential</b> <b>vote,</b> including the claims made for <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> with regard to the new South Africa and the robust debate on the merits of preferential electoral systems that has taken place in Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka and Fiji. It concludes by identifying a range of possible advantages that <b>preferential</b> <b>voting</b> may have in comparison to other majoritarian electoral systems such as first-past-the-post, particularly for divided societies...|$|R
