50|$|In the Winter 2012 {{edition of}} Main Line Magazine (Issue 153), it was {{announced}} that RVP had proposed plans for a four road carriage shed at the back of Swithland Sidings. It will mark a great step forward in the storage <b>of</b> <b>carriages</b> and help to clear the Swithland site to give a better prospect from passing trains. It will also help significantly in prolonging the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriages</b> after restoration. The 65 meter long shed will be able to house a total of 12 coaches over the four roads. Planning permission was put in with Charnwood Borough Council in Autumn 2012 and on 4 February 2013 the ambitious plans were given conditional approval. The conditions relate mainly to screening, trees and hedgerows and RVP will be working to meet these conditions before fund raising and building commences. The estimated cost of this superstructure comes out at around the £120,000 mark.|$|R

On November 7, 1969, Cesnik left the apartment shared with Sister Helen Russell Phillips at the Carriage House Apartments at 131 North Bend Road in West Baltimore, en route to the Edmondson Village Shopping Center to purchase a gift at Hecht's for her sister's engagement. Records found Cesnik cashed a paycheck at First National Bank in nearby Catonsville that night, and possibly made a purchase at Muhly's Bakery in Edmondson Village since a box of bakery buns was found {{in the front seat of}} the vehicle.

40|$|It is {{expected}} that the massive expansion <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods {{that went on in}} past couple of decades will soon resume after the worldwide recession.

60|$|But {{the result}} might be, that {{the fall of}} price might not have an effect exactly equal, on the demand in the two countries. Suppose, for instance, that the fall of cloth in Germany owing to the saving of the cost <b>of</b> <b>carriage,</b> did not {{increase}} the demand for cloth in Germany; but that the fall of linen in England from a like cause, did increase the demand for linen in England. The linen imported {{would be more than}} could be paid for by the cloth exported: the difference must be paid in money: the change in the distribution of the precious metals between the two countries would lower the price of cloth in England, (and consequently in Germany), while it would raise the price of linen in Germany, (and consequently in England). Germany, therefore, by the annihilation <b>of</b> cost <b>of</b> <b>carriage,</b> would save in price more than the cost <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> the cloth; England would save less in price than the cost <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> the linen. But if by the miraculous annihilation <b>of</b> cost <b>of</b> <b>carriage,</b> England would not save the whole <b>of</b> the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> her imports, it follows that England did not previously pay the whole of that cost <b>of</b> <b>carriage.</b>|$|R

However, businesses may choose to ban e-cigarettes as well. A notable example is Transport for London, banning smoking and vaping as their <b>Conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Carriage.</b> Effective October 1, 2015, it is illegal to sell e-cigarettes or e-liquids to minors. In 2014 the government announced legislation would be brought forward to outlaw the purchase of e-cigarettes by people under the age of 18. In October 2014 the UK's Advertising Standards Authority changed the regulations on e-cigarette advertising, allowing the devices to appear in TV ads from 10 November. The first advert {{to take advantage of the}} change, promoting KiK e-cigarettes, aired on the day it came into force.
