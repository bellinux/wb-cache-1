In many instances, {{they appear to be}} of early Ordovician age. They reflect a syn-sedimentary, volcanic exhalative origin and in many areas, e. g. the Leinster egion in southeast Ireland, they are intimately associated with, inter alia, base metal mineralization and with tourmalinite. However, though the metamorphic <b>coticule</b> is common, the pre-metamorphic <b>coticule</b> precursor has proved ifficult o recognize. Manganiferous ironstone r cks of <b>coticule</b> aspect are a distinctive feature in parts of the Manx Group exposed along the west coast of the Isle of Man. Though they lack any trace of the characteristic manganese garnet, perhaps reflecting arelatively low metamorphic grade, they do bear a strong morphological resemblance in outcrop to the typical <b>coticule</b> lithology of the Ribband Group in southeast Ireland. In both places, tourmaline-rich rocks occur nearby. On the Isle of Man, a major tourmalinite occurrence is linked to an important shear zone.

The chemical compositions of the <b>coticules</b> {{can be explained by}} protoliths formed from ferriferous and manganiferous hydrothermal precipitates mixed with aluminous alteration-derived material on top of oceanic crust. The peak conditions of metamorphism were calculated with multivariant reactions: 270 – 370 °C, 6 – 8 kbar. A retrograde P–T evolution was marked by decompression to 2 kbar during cooling below 300 °C, influx of an external fluid, and strain-free crystallization of retrograde phases. The appearance of “ferriwinchite”, “ferribarroisite ” and phengite in <b>coticules</b> and surrounding metabasic rocks marks the transition from greenschist to epidote blueschist facies. Oscillatory zoning in garnet within the <b>coticules</b> as well as in epidote and tourmaline in the metabasic rocks seems to be governed by the local chemical environment during prograde growth of minerals. Although the garnet in the <b>coticules</b> formed by a continuous prograde dehydration–decarbonation reaction, the primary fluid inclusions are predominantly hydrous owing to massive influx of fluid during the early stage of decompression. The late stage of decompression is bracketed by isochores of primary fluid inclusions that are clearly below peak conditions of metamorphism.

Three stratigraphic units in the area were considered for the studies: Valadão, São Roque and Lidice. Valadão unit was divided into three subunits: psamitic, psamitic / pelitic and pelitic. On the whole, it represents a turbiditic sequence influenced by underwater hydrothermal exhalations {{that led to the}} formation of quartzite with magnetite, considered as banded iron formations. São Roque Unit is composed of four subunits (São Roque I, II, III and IV) and presents a typical pattern of deposition of low energy environments, in marine deep basins. Gondite, <b>coticules</b> levels and (Mn) -almandine present in the local gneiss mark the manganese exalative contribution in that unit. Lídice unit has different sedimentation palaeoenvironments and is subdivided into Lídice I, II and III. Lídice subunits I and II exhibit quartzite interleaved with pelitic rocks and graphite gneiss, suggesting deposition in deeper environments of the basin, probably related to turbidity currents. In Lídice III subunit, more carbonated and with more quartz, limestone quartzite stand out, which enclose mineralized zones, reflecting depositional environment in shallow platform, possibly involving evaporitic environment, sabkha type.

40|$|Investigated were {{occurrences of}} magnetite-rich rocks (five {{of which are}} {{associated}} with garnetiferous rocks) situated in the Sobotin Massif (two localities) or in the adjacent gneisses of the Desna Group (six localities). As shown in previous literature, these rocks either belong to iron-formations (six localities) or are of magmatic origin (two localities). The investigations involved detailed petrographic studies supported by cathodoluminescence microscopy, whole-rock geochemical and mineral (amphibole, biotite, garnet, chlorite, magnetite, ilmenite, carbonate, feldspar and apatite) analyses. The minerals have compositions unknown to iron-formations. Instead they indicate that these may be genetically related to the basic rocks of the ?Devonian Sobotin Massif. Under late-stage and increasing oxygen fugacity conditions of the melt (of the Sobotin Massif), the Fe 3 + activity seems to have risen as well. This presumably led to progressive extraction of magnetite from the melt and its enrichment due to gravitational segregation. During this stage, apophyses, mainly composed of amphibole and magnetite, intruded in the gneisses of the Desna Group {{in the vicinity of}} the Sobotin Massif. These followed older generations of apophyses that are mainly composed of amphibole only. The garnet-rich rocks are definitely older than the studied magnetite-rich types and of the same age as the gneisses. The garnetites are inferred to represent original mixtures of precipitates from submarine exhalations and detrital material of continental-derived greywackes. In the absence of local volcanogenic activity, the sedimentary protoliths were composed exclusively of continental-derived material. During a first tectonometamorphic event, the greywacke-derived sediments were transformed into the host-rock gneiss and the mixtures into garnet-rich rocks (= granular iron-formations) identical to <b>coticules.</b> During a second tectonometamorphic event, all the mentioned rocks were overprinted (alignment and weak foliation of the rocks, chloritization of amphibole and biotite and the formation of actinolite from pre-existing tschermakite and magnesiohornblende, albite, carbonate and epidote).

40|$|Manganese-rich garnet-quartz {{rocks and}} gneisses {{occur in the}} Varied Group of the Moldanubian Zone, Bohemian Massif, in close {{association}} with amphibolites, marbles and accompanying graphite gneisses. Fine-grained garnets contain (mol. %) 26 - 37 spessartine, 36. 8 - 45. 9 almandine, 11. 1 - 14. 3 pyrope, 2. 9 - 21. 0 grossular. Minor amphibole present in some samples is ferrimagnesiohornblende with 0. 17 - 0. 22 Mn pfu. Accessory ilmenite contains 24 - 34 mol. % pyrophanite and 1. 7 - 5. 8 hematite. Some closely associated impure calcite marbles (or amphibolites) carry Ti-bearing andradite, epidote, diopside-hedenbergite, and accessory magnetite. Data from the Varied Group indicate that manganese enrichment took place both under oxidizing and reducing conditions, but the Mn-garnet-quartz rocks are oxidic. Normalization of major-element contents in the Mn-rich rocks by average abundances in Varied Group paragneisses shows ten- to hundred-fold enrichment in MnO and a slight to moderate increase in CaO and P 2 O 5 . Values for Na 2 O and K 2 O indicate severe depletion in some samples, but contents of other oxides are close to unity. Comparison of chondrite-normalized REE patterns in Mn-rich rocks with data for ordinary paragneisses (Varied Group) also indicates that detrital component in Mn-rich rocks was closely comparable to material supplied for protolith of paragneisses. This permits to ascribe the spike of Mn to likely short-lived exhalative processes. Manganese-rich garnet-quartz rocks and gneisses remained unnoticed till now mainly owing to a small thickness of their layers, typically less than 1 m. Structural relations in regions carrying Mn-rich rocks indicate their occurrence in relict domains of preserved D 1 structures with NW-SE trending foliation. It is suggested that in regionally prevalent areas dominated by superimposed refoliation (D 2 , D 3 ) the thin layers of Mn-rich rocks were likely reduced to boudins dispersed in paragneiss matrix. Comparison with published data for similar Mn-rich rocks abroad (including the so-called <b>coticules)</b> strongly indicates a lithostratigraphic correlation potential of Mn-rich garnet-quartz rocks...|$|R
40|$|Coticules (garnet-rich quartzites) are {{chemically}} distinctive lithologies {{of controversial}} origin. They generally occur in pelitic schists, amphibolites, cherts, and quartzites as thin layers or discontinuous lenses in Paleozoic formations in the New England Appalachians and other orogenic belts. Geochemical {{data were collected}} to characterize coticules and their host rocks from the Middle Silurian Perry Mountain Formation of southern New Hampshire (near Rochester) and western Maine (near Rangeley), and the Cambrian Megunticook Formation of coastal Maine (Camden and Calais). Relative to their host rocks, the coticules are enriched in Fe, Mn, and P, and depleted in Ti and alkalis. Electron-microprobe analyses of garnet show higher spessartine and lower almandine components relative to garnet in the host. Coticules are light-REE-enriched and heavy-REE-depleted. They have concentrations between 10 and 100 times those of chondrites, generally lack a Ce anomaly, and have a negative Eu anomaly. Major-element compositions and REE profiles argue strongly against a hydrothermal origin for these rocks, and do not obviously support a hydrogenous (diagenetic) origin such as Mn–Fe formation. Rare-earth-element patterns differ as much within a local area as for widely separated samples within a single formation. All three samples from the Megunticook Formation are nearly identical, supporting stratigraphic correlation.

40|$|A polymetallic {{sulphide}} occurrence, the Isle aux Morts Prospect, {{is located}} within the Port aux Basques Gneiss Complex of southwest Newfoundland. This is the first such mineralization {{to be found in}} the Complex and is the basis of the present study. [...] Three main lithologic units dominate the geology of the area and these comprise quartzofeldspathic, pelitic and amphibole-bearing rocks. The quartzofeldspathic units are leucocratic, quartz-feldspar-biotite-garnet-bearing rocks which are interpreted to be felsic meta-tuffs and or felsic meta-volcanoclastic greywackes. Pelites vary from leucocratic, quartz-muscovite ± kyanite to melanocratic, biotite-garnet-kyanite rocks which are thought to be felsic tuffs and shales respectively. Amphibolites which contain amphibole ± garnet ± biotite, are ubiquitously intercalated with pelites and quartzofeldspathic rocks throughout the area. The proposed protoliths of the amphibolites are mafic sills/dikes and/or mafic tuffs. The amphibolites are tholeiitic and have a chemical affinity with ocean floor basalts. The geochemistry of all the rocks defines an essentially bimodal sequence of rhyolites/dacites and tholeiites. [...] Structures recognized in the study area are interpreted to be the results of four episodes of deformation. The earliest, D 1, is represented by isoclinal, recumbent folds affecting what is considered to be a primary layering. D 2 is defined by a phase of tight, upright to inclined (towards the NE) folds associated with the formation of the regional S 2 foliation. D 3 is a minor phase manifested by a faint crenulation cleavage, axial planar to asymetric folds. D 4 is defined by kinks, chevron folds and faults. [...] The Isle aux Morts Prospect area lies within a medium-pressure, Barrovian-type, metamorphic facies series terrane. The amphibolite facies paragenesis garnet-kyanite-biotite ± staurolite is commonly observed in pelites and hornblende ± garnet ± biotite ± epidote in amphibolites. A staurolite-muscovite-quartz zone and staurolite-quartz zone are recognized. The area lies within bathozone 5. Estimated pressures and temperatures from the garnet-plagioclase geobarometer and garnet-biotite geothermometer average 6. 7 kb and 650 ﾟC. U-Pb dates from zircon rims and sphenes from an amphibolite, give a metamorphic age of 410 ± 5 Ma. [...] Three textural types of mineralization are identified viz., a massive type comprising greater than 50 % sulphides; a disseminated type in semipelitic, quartz-muscovite ± kyanite rocks and a banded type occurring in quartzitic rocks. The mineralization occurs at the contact between supposed felsic meta-tuffs to the north and felsic meta-volcanoclastic rocks with intercalated mafic meta-tuffs and pelites to the south. The felsic meta-tuffs contain ubiquitous disseminated pyrite and locally disseminated and banded chalcopyrite, sphalerite and galena. The pelites contain ubiquitous <b>coticules</b> thought to represent Mn-rich chemical sediments. Average &³⁴S values are 10 permil, typical of many volcanic-associated massive sulphide bodies. [...] The sulphides record the same deformational effects as the enclosing rocks and are pre-deformational. The massive type of mineralization exhibits a deformational fabric of rounded silicate fragments in a sulphide matrix characteristic of deformed/metamorphosed massive sulphide bodies. Mineralized semipelites display a K 20 enrichment and Na 20 depletion characteristic of alteration associated with massive sulphide deposits in volcanic/sedimentary lithologies. The observations above are best interpreted by a model in which the mineralization is of the volcanogenic type...|$|R
40|$|The Mesoproterozoic Bushmanland Subprovince {{of northwestern}} South Africa forms the western {{continuation}} of the transcontinental Namaqua-Natal Metamorphic Province, a crustal domain affected by the 1020 - 1220 Ma Namaquan Orogeny. Cross-cut by several large faults, the Bushmanland Subprovince can be subdivided into a southern Garies Terrain and northern Aggeneys Terrain. The supracrustal rocks of the Aggeneys Terrain (i. e. Bushmanland Group), comprise a thin (250 °C), metalliferous hydrothermal fluids infiltrated and altered these hydrogenous Fe-Mnrich metasedimentary rocks, resulting in the deposition of base-metal sulfides, formation of magnetite-amphibolite-rich Fe-Mn-rich rocks, as well as hydrothermal alteration of the siliciclastic wall rocks to form <b>coticules.</b> The spatial restriction of epigenetic Fe-Mn-rich rocks to shear zones, high Fe 2 O 3 T (ca. 65 wt %), low ΣREE (ca. 13 ppm), presence of recrystallized quartz crystals, elevated concentration of Cu in some occurrences and general similarities with some hydrothermal iron/iron-oxide copper-gold (IOCG) deposits, suggests that the epigenetic Fe-Mn-rich rocks may have formed during prograde metamorphism. Low concentrations of SrO (0. 5 ± 0. 2 wt %), highly radiogenic Sr/ Sr ratios (0. 7164 ± 0. 0028), elevated δ S (27. 3 ± 4. 9 ‰) and δ O (7. 7 ± 3. 1 ‰) values in the barites, as compared to contemporaneous Mesoproterozoic seawater, suggests precipitation of stratiform and stratabound barite layers in the Bushmanland Group occurred through mixing of an evolved continental crustal source and contemporaneous seawater sulfate, 87 86 34 18 modified by bacterial sulfate reduction. Most importantly, δ O values suggest possible minimum temperatures of formation ranging from 18 250 °C for occurrences in the Aggeneys area. These obvious differences in temperature of formation are in good agreement with the Cu-rich, Ba-poor nature of the sulfide mineralization characteristic of the Aggeneys deposits versus the Cu-poor, Ba-rich character of the Gamsberg deposit. In conjunction with this, the isotopic and petrographic arguments favor a sub-seafloor replacement model for the stratabound barite occurrences of the Aggeneys deposits, while at Gamsberg, deposition at the sediment-water interface as a true sedimentary exhalite appears more acceptable. Data obtained in the present study, combined {{with the results of}} previous investigations can be used to develop a comprehensive model for the geological evolution of the Aggeneys Terrain and Namaqua Metamorphic Province. The tectono-sedimentary evolution of the Aggeneys Terrain and Namaqua Metamorphic Province is marked by two important tectonic events separated by an episode of tectonic quiescence. Extrusion and deposition of the metavolcano-sedimentary rocks of the Orange River Group at 1908 Ma marks the start of the Orange River Orogeny. vii Prior to emplacement of the Vioolsdrift Intrusive Suite, the Orange River Group appears to have undergone a period of folding and low-grade metamorphism [D 1 /M 1] that was subsequently followed by emplacement of the Main Phase Vioolsdrift Intrusive Suite roughly dated at 1890 Ma. Rapidly following emplacement of these intrusions, the lower crustal rocks of the Richtersveld Subprovince underwent a second, higher, amphibolite-facies metamorphic event [M 1 B] from 1870 - 1840 Ma. This event may have resulted in lower crustal melting and emplacement of the Gladkop Suite into an unknown package of metasediments or metasedimentary rocks south of the present day Orange River at roughly 1820 Ma. The Gladkop Suite was subsequently subjected to high-grade metamorphism at 1800 Ma. The Orange River Orogeny was terminated by emplacement of the Late Phase Vioolsdrift Intrusive Suite at approximately 1765 Ma and later northward-directed thrusting. Following termination of the Orange River Orogeny, deposition of the Bushmanland Group began in a tectonically stable environment marked by punctuated periods of tectonic activity that lasted until emplacement of the Little Namaqualand Suite at 1190 Ma. The detrital zircon populations of the Pella Quartzite Fm. and Koeris Fm. support (a) regional correlation of these stratigraphic units throughout the study area, (b) confirms sediment derivation from various local source terrains and (c) suggests a maximum depositional age of 1650 Ma. Furthermore, new age constraints reveal initiation of the O’okiepian Episode (Namaquan Orogeny), characterized by regional-scale mid- to high-grade contact metamorphism, was synchronous with emplacement of the Little Namaqualand Suite and deposition of the upper Kouboom Subgroup. Furthermore, the detrital zircon populations for the Driekop Fm. (upper Kouboom Subgroup) contain a large population of 1190 Ma (i. e. O’okiepian-age) detrital cores, suggesting a renewed period of tectonic uplift. Analogously, age constraints for the Koeris Fm. indicate a maximum depositional age of 1130 Ma, as well as derivation from a number of local and exotic source terrains indicating that deposition of the Koeris Fm. must have occurred in response to continental collision between the Rehoboth Inlier-Kaapvaal Craton and the Namaqua Metamorphic Province. Furthermore, these new age constraints also constrain the timing of D 2 -D 3 deformation to between 1130 - 1080 Ma and regional peak metamorphism to 1020 - 1040 Ma. Prof. N. J. Beukes Prof. J.
