Recently, carbon-based nanoelectrodes have been employed to create single-molecule transistors and phase change memory devices.

In this paper, we report on our observations of <b>consistent</b> <b>voltage</b> driven resistance switching in sub- 5 nm graphene nanogaps. We find that we are able to reversibly cycle between a low and a high resistance state using feedback-controlled voltage ramps. We attribute this unexplained switching in the gap to the formation and breakdown of carbon filaments.

40|$|We give an {{overview}} of well-known methods for graph-based transduction. In graph-based transduction we are given a fixed set of objects, {{some of which are}} labeled and some of which are unlabeled, and we wish to predict the unlabeled objects. A graph is then defined where an edge between objects indicates similarity between objects. If the graph is weighted then the weights indicate the degree of similarity. These include the min-cut method of [2] and the harmonic energy minimization procedure of [5] (also [1]). We interpret these methods as specific instances of the minimization of a p-energy [3]. When p = 2 the analogy is that the graph is an electrical network; the edges are now resistors whose resistance is reciprocal of the similarity. The fixed labels from {− 1, 1 } now correspond to potential (voltage) constraints and the algorithm for labeling the graph is then to find the set of <b>consistent</b> <b>voltages</b> which minimize the energy dissipation and then to predict with the “sign ” of the voltages.

Asynchronous gaps worked quite well and were much easier to maintain. By using a larger number of rotating studs or a higher rotational speed, many asynchronous gaps operated at break rates in excess of 400 breaks/second. Since the gap could fire more often than the input waveform could switch polarity, the tank capacitor charged and discharged more rapidly than a synchronous gap.

40|$|Graphene nano-gap {{electrodes}} {{have been}} of recent interest {{in a variety of}} fields, ranging from molecular electronics to phase change memories. Several recent reports have highlighted that scaling graphene nano-gaps to even smaller sizes is a promising route to more efficient and robust molecular and memory devices. In spite of the significant interest, the operating and scaling limits of these electrodes are completely unknown. In this paper, we report on our observations of <b>consistent</b> <b>voltage</b> driven resistance switching in sub- 5 nm graphene nanogaps. We find that such electrical switching from an insulating state to a conductive state occurs at very low currents and voltages (0. 06 μA, and 140 mV), independent of the conditions (room ambient, low temperatures, as well as in vacuum), thus portending potential limits to scaling of functional devices with carbon electrodes. We then associate this phenomenon to the formation and rupture of carbon chains. Using a phase change material in the nanogap as a demonstrator device, fabricated using a self-alignment technique, we show that for gap sizes approaching 1 nm, the switching is dominated by such carbon chain formation, creating a fundamental scaling limit for potential devices. These findings have important implications, not only for fundamental science, but also in terms of potential applications...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} new power tracing {{technique}} using computational intelligence approach for non discriminatory losses charge allocation and voltage stability improvement. Contrary to conventional techniques which mainly rely on matrix operation, the proposed algorithm implements optimization technique {{as an alternative}} for performing the tracing process. At first, in producing a good optimization algorithm, a hybridization technique was proposed for adopting the finest features of two different algorithms; namely the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and continuous domain Ant Colony Optimization (ACOr). The hybrid algorithm is termed as the Blended Crossover Continuous Ant Colony Optimization (BX-CACO). It was found that performing power tracing via BX-CACO produced reliable tracing results as it is free from assumption like proportional sharing principle (PSP). Without treating the power system to be lossless, the tracing results are based on actual system condition; {{which means that they}} are consistent. Despite BX-CACO required computation time during optimization process, it is still within tolerable range. In addition, the proposed technique was able to promote fair losses charge allocation by involving imaginary consumers other than generation companies (GENCOs) and distribution companies (DISCOs); where, not all conventional tracing techniques include such consideration in their pricing scheme. Subsequently, the developed tracing algorithm was modified in the context of stability index tracing. At this stage, the limited application of power tracing in the field of power system economics was enhanced for the purpose of voltage stability improvement. By utilizing the Fast Voltage Stability Index (FVSI) as the index to be traced, the proposed stability index tracing is called FFSZ-Tracing (FVSI-T); which consists of two schemes namely /•’KSY-Gcneration Tracing (FVSI-GT) and F VS I-Load Tracing (FVSFLT). From both schemes of FVSI-T, a ranking list indicating the priority of buses to be performed any countermeasures against voltage instability was derived. Contrary to conventional techniques such as sensitivity analysis and stability index approach, the derived ranking list consists of two types of locations ranked based on their priority; which are bus and line. In addition, the ranking list derived from BX-CACO-based-/*TS/-T is available at any system conditions and includes all possible sources and sinks that also participate in the system. This highlights its merit over conventional ranking techniques. After experiment and comparative studies, it was justified that the derived ranking list gave reliable signal for satisfactory and <b>consistent</b> <b>voltage</b> stability improvement in the problem of generation power dispatch, placement of compensating devices, and load shedding. Regardless of the change in system condition, the derived ranking list from FVSI-T resulted in steady trend of voltage magnitude and consistent losses reduction as compared to convetional methods. Eventually, in providing an effective load shedding scheme with reliable amount of load power to be shed, an intuitive Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) was designed using FVSI as the criterion when designing its membership functions and rules. Through experiment, the proposed method resulted in the most <b>consistent</b> <b>voltage</b> stability improvement over other methods as both FIS and the derived ranking list are based on FVSI...|$|E

The generator has been specifically designed to supply power {{to a wide range of}} plasma actuators. The system has been completely designed, manufactured and tested at the Department of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering of the University of Bologna. The generator structure is based on the single phase cascaded H-bridge multilevel topology and is comprised of 24 elementary units that are series connected in order to form the typical staircase output voltage waveform of a multilevel converter. The total number of voltage levels that can be produced by the generator is 49. Each level is 600 V making the output peak-to-peak voltage equal to 28. 8 kV. The large number of levels provides high resolution with respect to the output voltage having thus the possibility to generate arbitrary waveforms. Maximum frequency of operation is 20 kHz. A study of the relevant literature shows that this is the first time that a cascaded multilevel converter of such dimensions has been constructed. Isolation and control challenges had to be solved for the realization of the system. The biggest problem of the current technology in power supplies for plasma actuators is load matching. Resonant converters are the most used power supplies and are seriously affected by this problem. The manufactured generator completely solves this issue providing <b>consistent</b> <b>voltage</b> output independently of the connected load. This fact is very important when executing tests and during the comparison of the results because all measures should be comparable and not dependent from matching issues. The use of the multilevel converter for power supplying a plasma actuator is a real technological breakthrough that has provided and will continue to provide very significant experimental results...|$|E

The parameter space for SOFC operation on hydrogen and hydrocarbon fuels is calculated using thermodynamic methods to find equilibrium conditions. The interrelation between parameters that determine cell efficiency and stability, such as the Nernst open circuit voltage, fuel utilization, and tendency to form solid carbon as a reaction product are explored. Methane fueling is found to have a more <b>consistent</b> <b>voltage</b> than hydrogen at high fuel utilizations at temperatures below 650 °C, which correlates with increased theoretical efficiency. Reformed methane and jet fuel compositions that prevent carbon deposition are identified. SOFCs with nickel - gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) cermet anodes are fabricated and studied using hydrogen and reformed hydrocarbon fuels to determine the kinetic limitations to SOFC operation at 650 °C and below. Operating SOFCs on reformed hydrocarbons gives comparable performance to using hydrogen as a fuel, with as little as a 5 % decrease in maximum power density (MPD). Stable performance of 220 mW/cm 2 while fueling with reformed jet fuel at 550 °C is observed. Porous ceramic anodes fabricated from GDC are developed to prevent the mechanical damage caused by volume changes of Ni metal in conventional, randomly-mixed cermet anodes. The mechanical properties of the porous ceramics are extensively characterized, and the electrical properties of the scaffold anode are measured after infiltrating with metals. The porous ceramics attain strengths of > 100 MPa, and have similar conductance to Ni-GDC cermet anodes but with ~ 70 % less metal.
