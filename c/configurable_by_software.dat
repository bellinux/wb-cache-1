The user may choose between FTGL and QuesoGLC for font rendering.|$|R
30|$|Considering usability, Google Compute Engine {{caught up}} and its {{firewall}} is now also configurable via the web interface. Previously, the firewall was solely <b>configurable</b> <b>by</b> means of command line instruction and made configuration difficult for less experienced users.

Now, they are also easily configurable via Azure web interface.|$|R
50|$|A {{northbound}} interface is typically an output-only interface (as opposed {{to one that}} accepts user input) found in carrier-grade network and telecommunications network elements. The languages or protocols commonly used include SNMP and TL1.

30|$|In {{the present}} work we {{investigate}} {{the properties of}} localized states in a kink potential profile under a perpendicular external magnetic field, both for {{the case of a}} single potential kink, as well as for a kink-antikink pair. One advantage of such a setup is the fact that in an experimental realization of this system the number of one-dimensional metallic channels and their subsequent magnetic response can be <b>configurable,</b> <b>by</b> controlling the gate voltages. As shown by our numerical results, the influence of the magnetic field can be strikingly distinct for single and double kinks.|$|R
30|$|Random {{workload}} this workload can {{be generated}} automatically using the Web service definitions mentioned above. For every parameter of each operation, a set of valid input values (values in the parameter domain specified by the benchmark user) is generated randomly. The number of generated values is <b>configurable</b> <b>by</b> the user if using wsrbench [31] as testing tool. Those values are combined {{in such a way}} that guarantees a large number of valid execution calls, improving the coverage of the workload. The benchmark user must specify the intended total number of executions for each operation.|$|R
50|$|IEC 61499-4 {{describes}} {{the rules that}} a system, device or software tool must follow to be compliant to IEC 61499. These rules are related to interoperability, portability and configuration. Two devices are interoperable if they can work together to provide the functionality specified by a system configuration. Applications compliant to IEC 61499 have to be portable, {{which means that they}} can be exchanged between software tools of different vendors considering the requirements for software tools described within IEC 61499-2. Devices of any vendor have to be <b>configurable</b> <b>by</b> any IEC 61499 compliant software tool.|$|R

50|$|At the receiver, the {{infrared}} signal strengths are measured by {{some form of}} infrared detector. Generally photodiode detectors are preferred, and are essential for the higher modulation frequencies, whereas slower photoconductive detectors may be required for longer wavelength regions. The signals are fed to low-noise amplifiers, then invariably subject {{to some form of}} digital signal processing. The absorption coefficient of the gas will vary across the passband, so the simple Beer-Lambert law cannot be applied directly. For this reason the processing usually employs a calibration table, applicable for a particular gas, type of gas, or gas mixture, and sometimes <b>configurable</b> <b>by</b> the user.|$|R
