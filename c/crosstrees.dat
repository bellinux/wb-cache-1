2500|$|Cromer Windmill is a {{post mill}} {{with a single}} storey roundhouse. The trestle, entirely made of oak, [...] is {{enclosed}} by the roundhouse. The main post is [...] square at its lower end, and [...] diameter at the crown tree. It is [...] long. The <b>crosstrees,</b> [...] long. [...] are carried on four brick piers of about [...] height.

2500|$|The trestle is of oak. The <b>crosstrees</b> are [...] long, {{of normal}} section. The main post is [...] in length, and [...] square {{at its base}} and [...] {{diameter}} at the top. The underside of the lower crosstree is [...] above ground level. The roundhouse is of brick, with a boarded roof covered in tarred felt. A pair of underdrift millstones {{is located on the}} upper floor of the roundhouse, these were driven via a portable steam engine in times of calm. The roundhouse was originally built as a single-storey structure, it and the mill being raised a storey at a later date.|$|E

The upper crosstree is [...] {{square in}} section {{and the lower}} crosstree is [...] by [...] The upper crosstree is made of two pieces of timber, scarf jointed in the vertical plane, and with an iron plate bolted under the join. There is also an oak plate {{on one side of}} the crosstree, which is bolted to the crosstree, a pair of spacers being used as the scarf is [...] within the horns of the main post. The lower crosstree bears a date of 1869, which is probably the date the roundhouse was erected. The main post is [...] in length, and [...] by [...] in section at its base. It is fitted with a cast-iron Samson head by Christie and Norris, the Chelmsford millwrights.|$|E

Effectively, the <b>crosstree</b> allows to extend the height, mount yet another layer of sail shrouds and option more wind power to the ships. The <b>crosstree</b> also serves to spread the shroud tops.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Crosstree</b> {{serves as}} a fresh base to spread {{the next level of}} {{supporting}} [...] guy ropes, thereby providing a stable height extension to the masts. Without the <b>crosstree,</b> the ship's mast would have been severely limited in height, in relation to the width [...] (beam) of the ship.|$|R

2500|$|A {{survey in}} 2007 {{revealed}} the mill {{was in danger}} of collapsing. Of concern were the roundhouse, <b>crosstrees,</b> crown tree, sails, tailpole and fantail. On 14 January 2008, a meeting was held in Mayfield, where Wealden District Council put forward options for the mill's future. One proposal, to dismantle the mill and remove it to storage was strongly criticised by those attending, including members of the Sussex Mills Group and the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. It was pointed out that Wealden District Council had not spent money allocated for maintenance of the mill, and that giving themselves permission to demolish a listed building would make other listed buildings in the area more vulnerable, and erode the protection given by listed building status. [...] As a result, the Friends of Argos Hill Windmill was set up to save the mill.|$|E
2500|$|In 1719, Matthew Crane was the miller. In 1773, John Pearman of Luffenhall {{inherited}} the mill from his uncle, John Crane. Pearman sold the mill to Thomas Pearman in 1800. In 1822 the mill passed to William Munt, {{who worked the}} mill {{until his death in}} 1837, when the mill passed to his widow Edith, who worked it until 1856 when her son David took over. He sold the mill for £600 to William Boorman in 1869. There is a suggestion that mill may have been blown down about this time, since the <b>crosstrees</b> have been dated by dendrochronology to 1840-70. Boorman was a blacksmith as well as a miller, and carried on both trades at the mill. He died in 1877 leaving the mill to his widow Emily. She ran the mill until 1888, when her son Ebenezer took over. A steam engine was being used as auxiliary power by this time. The mill was sold to Samuel Woollatt in the late 1890s, and Joseph Scowen was the tenant miller. The steam engine had been replaced by an oil engine by 1919; It worked a pair of millstones on a hurst frame outside the roundhouse. [...] The mill was without sails in this year, although new sails were fitted by 1920. When a new [...] long stock was imported from Sweden, the journey from Buntingford not being without difficulty as the stock went through a cottage window at one point. Scowen worked the mill until his death in 1920. The mill was worked by Joseph Ponder Scowen's widow Marian for a couple of years, and in 1922 Richard Hull took the mill. Hull worked the mill until 1930, apparently using the oil engine after 1923. The fantail had blown off by 1926 and one of the sails had been blown off by July 1929. The other three sails had been taken down by 1932 and the mill became derelict.|$|E

60|$|Planting the oar for a mast was no easy matter. Of {{course we}} {{did not attempt to}} do it until we had made the boom, and also a small <b>crosstree</b> at the top, from which we {{suspended}} the sail, not very artistically, it is true, but in such a fashion that it drew very well.|$|R

60|$|I recall {{these things}} {{with a certain}} degree of feeling, because not less than a week later this poor fellow was {{discovered}} by one of our company swinging from the <b>crosstree</b> of the tent, a ghastly corpse. There was something inexplicable in the deed. No one could account for it. He seemed not to be a man of deep feeling. And one of the last things he uttered in my hearing was a coarse jest which I did not like and to which I made no reply.|$|R

A man in the <b>crosstrees</b> will make it out twenty miles away, and that will tell them where I am, and that I don't want them. If I burn a red light it will be a signal for the yacht to come and pick me up." ...|$|E
5000|$|The taller the mast, {{the wider}} a base is {{required}} for the [...] guy wires so as to form an appropriate angular support against the sway the mast is exposed to. Yet, ships are fixed in their [...] beam (width) and hence only a limited angle is possible for the guy-ropes to support very high masts. Thereby, the taller the ship's mast, the more narrow and unfeasible would be the angle between its support wires and its top. This is where a simple innovation like the <b>crosstree</b> helps to overcome such limitation.|$|R
2500|$|A {{courtesy}} flag (or courtesy ensign) is flown by a visiting ship in foreign waters as {{a token of}} respect. It is often a small (that is, smaller than the ship's own national ensign) national maritime flag of the host country, although there are countries (such as Malta) where the national, rather than the maritime flag is correct. [...] The flag is customarily worn at the foremasthead of multi-masted vessels, the dockside yardarm or <b>crosstree</b> of the mast of single-masted vessels, while the house flag would be outboard. [...] It may be flown from the jackstaff of vessels without masts.|$|R

As they continue traveling slowly through the hot desert, Gashade observes that they are being followed by a stranger dressed in black, Billy Spear (Nicholson), who continues to keep his distance from them. Gashade sees that the woman appears to be signaling to the man. Coley makes attempts to talk to the woman but she continually taunts and insults him. She also repeatedly refuses to answer any of Gashade's questions regarding the purpose of their journey.|$|R

From {{one of the}} galleys behind the screen of rocks a trumpet rang out in immediate answer to that signal; {{it was followed by}} the shrill whistles of the bo'suns, and that again by the splash and creak of oars, as the two larger galleys swept out from their ambush. The long armoured poops were a-swarm with turbaned corsairs, their weapons gleaming in the sunshine; a dozen at least were astride of the <b>crosstree</b> of each mainmast, all armed with bows and arrows, and the ratlines {{on each side of the}} galleys were black with men who swarmed there like locusts ready to envelop and smother their prey.|$|R
50|$|Passed Midshipman Eld {{was one of}} the {{officers}} of the U.S. exploring expedition under Capt. Charles Wilkes in 1838 and 1842 in search of the Antarctic continent, which Eld first descried and called out land from the <b>crosstree</b> of the sloop Peacock on January 16, 1840. From this the United States dates the first discovery of the Antarctic continent, and Capt. Wilkes named the highest mountain peak Eld Peak (which is part of what was later named the Lazarev Mountains). They proved that the Antarctic was a continent (Eld was the first to see the Antarctic mountains at a crucial stage of their survey of the ice fields). On January 10, 1840 Eld was part of a two-man landing party to investigate Macquarie Island, one of the first men to do so. Splitting with his quarter-master, he explored a penguin rookery alone, and was surprised by resistance the birds gave him. Eld kept journals and sketch books of the Wilkes Expedition, accompanied by letters, reports and orders, documenting his personal and professional life.|$|R
40|$|Variability {{intensive}} {{systems may}} include several thousand features allowing for {{an enormous number}} of possible configurations, including wrong ones (e. g. the derived product does not compile). For years, engineers have been using constraints to a priori restrict the space of possible configurations, i. e. to exclude configurations that would violate these constraints. The challenge is to find the set of constraints that would be both precise (allow all correct configurations) and complete (never allow a wrong configuration with respect to some oracle). In this paper, we propose the use of a machine learning approach to infer such product-line constraints from an oracle that is able to assess whether a given product is correct. We propose to randomly generate products from the product line, keeping for each of them its resolution model. Then we classify these products accord-ing to the oracle, and use their resolution models to infer <b>crosstree</b> constraints over the product-line. We validate our approach on a product-line video generator, using a simple computer vision algorithm as an oracle. We show that an interesting set of cross-tree constraint can be generated, with reasonable precision and recall...|$|R

5000|$|Marcus Marius is a {{character}} in Michael Curtis Ford's historical novel about Mithradates, The Last King: Rome's Greatest Enemy (2004). He is depicted as maintaining a rugged and arrogant ideal of Republican manliness: [...] "I eat like a soldier, I march like a soldier, and by the gods I fight like a soldier — a Roman soldier." [...] Ford imagines that this Marius was a nephew of the seven-time consul — a grandnephew would be more likely, since the consul's nephew Marcus Marius, known by his cognomen Gratidianus, died in the proscriptions — and that his presence at the Pontic court was meant to draw the support of popularist sympathizers {{supposed to have been}} among Lucullus's forces from the legions who had served under Fimbria. Ford's fictional description of Marius's execution recalls the dismemberment of Gratidianus: [...] "he had Marius mounted on a <b>crosstree</b> in that barbaric exercise the Romans call crucifixion and then lopped off his hands, feet, nose, and ears, pruning him like a fig tree in winter. It was a deliberately brutal message, and its effect was not lost, for it caused most of the other exiled Romans fighting for Pontus to scatter in discouragement." ...|$|R
60|$|Both he and Johnson {{would have}} killed Wolf Larsen at the {{slightest}} opportunity, but the opportunity never came. Wolf Larsen was too wise for that, and, besides, they had no adequate weapons. With their fists alone they had no chance whatever. Time and again he fought it out with Leach who fought back always, like a wildcat, tooth and nail and fist, until stretched, exhausted or unconscious, on the deck. And he was never averse to another encounter. All the devil that was in him challenged the devil in Wolf Larsen. They had but to appear on deck at the same time, when they would be at it, cursing, snarling, striking; and I have seen Leach fling himself upon Wolf Larsen without warning or provocation. Once he threw his heavy sheath-knife, missing Wolf Larsen’s throat by an inch. Another time he dropped a steel marlinspike from the mizzen <b>crosstree.</b> It was a difficult cast to make on a rolling ship, but the sharp point of the spike, whistling seventy-five feet through the air, barely missed Wolf Larsen’s head as he emerged from the cabin companion-way and drove its length two inches and over into the solid deck-planking. Still another time, he stole into the steerage, possessed himself of a loaded shot-gun, and was making a rush for the deck with it when caught by Kerfoot and disarmed.|$|R
