30|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{computational}} complexity of the comprehensive model, we have proposed four step HFTTC-TMBF heuristic method in which first the K best disjoint paths were chosen between each node pair of the network. Then GB-LCA method is proposed for assigning channels to links of these paths by using the genetic algorithm such that the potential interference is minimized. In next step, GB-CSF is employed to extract the sets of compatible links on each frequency channel that can be activated simultaneously without any interference. These sets are selected with regard to the maximization of transmission rates and providing balancing between transmission rates of the links. Finally, for selecting the best paths for transmitting the traffic flows, GB-CLPS algorithm is proposed in which objectives such as node utilization balancing, frequency <b>channel</b> <b>balancing</b> and fairness are obtained employing channel selection and path selection tools. In order to verify the performance of the proposed methods, extensive simulations were done.

Moreover, the borrowing needs of both parts of the monarchy were quite large, since Austria and Hungary sought to promote their own economic development through government spending. Yet no Â‘fiscal stability pactÂ’ existed: the two countries could run deficits to the extent of the public's willingness to lend to them.

40|$|Following an {{original}} proposal {{by the authors}} to the TerraSAR-X (TSX) scientific coordination board, a spaceborne-airborne bistatic experiment was successfully performed early November 2007. TSX was used as transmitter and DLR's new airborne radar system, F-SAR, as receiver; due to the capability of the latter to acquire data quasi-continuously, no echo window synchronisation is needed. Monostatic data were also recorded during the acquisition. This paper includes description and results of the spaceborne-airborne bistatic experiment, with special focus on data processing and image comparison. Given the acquisition scenario, with two-channel sampling and transmitter and receiver clocks operating independently, data processing must necessarily follow a three-step strategy: 1) <b>channel</b> <b>balancing,</b> 2) data synchronisation and 3) bistatic SAR processing. Since neither absolute range nor Doppler references {{are available in the}} bistatic data set, synchronisation is done with the help of calibration targets on ground and based on the analysis of the acquired data compared to expected data.

40|$|Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a well-proven imaging {{technique}} for remote sensing. However, conventional SAR {{systems are not}} capable to fulfil the increasing demands for both improved spatial resolution and wider swath coverage. This inherent limitation can be overcome by multi-channel SAR systems, which gather additional information along the synthetic aperture, thus enabling high-resolution wide-swath (HRWS) imaging.

40|$|The {{loading of}} foams with liquid weight, contributed {{primarily}} by the Plateau borders, results in an external force which may often be important to structure and drainage, especially in foams of a higher liquid content; loading induces deformations in structures. A Plateau border in a three-dimensional foam is supported by three films, which are assumed to sag under loading, initially with linear elasticity in these numerical simulations. The weight of a Plateau border is allowed to vary along its length, {{in accordance with the}} foam drainage equation for a single <b>channel</b> (<b>balancing</b> gravity and capillarity for a given channel size and orientation). The surface area of the deformed structure is subsequently minimized in the Surface Evolver, and it is found that only for sufficiently dry borders, the films have linear elasticity. For wet foams, the true distortion due to loading is larger than the linear model predicts; an iterative approach, based on the solution of the drainage equation and a direct application of gravitational forces in the Surface Evolver, is developed for wetter Plateau borders. The implications for forced-drainage experiments and continuum-level drainage models are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{widespread}} acceptance of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery by {{the scientific community}} in recent years, SAR system design faces ever increasing demands for wide coverage of high resolution images. This represents a challenging task, since conventional monostatic SAR system are inherently subject to a compromise between the achievable resolution and {{the width of the}} imaged swath. In this context, multi-channel SAR systems arise as a promising alternative to overcome this limitation and achieve high-resolution wide-swath (HRWS) SAR imaging. Their operation requires the acquisition of more information about the scene through multiple channels and suitable digital beamforming techniques to adequately combine the output data. The innovative Multi-Channel Reconstruction Algorithm (MCRA) was recently introduced as a suitable alternative for the processing required by multi-channel SAR systems in azimuth. This thesis performs and evaluates on a demonstration of the capabilities of this algorithm employing real SAR multi-channel data acquired by DLR's new airborne system F-SAR. The combination of up to four different channels is performed, and analyzes of the algorithm performance follow, especially with regard to ambiguity suppression. The impact of channel imbalances in the residual ambiguity levels is considered and different <b>channel</b> <b>balancing</b> methods are assessed. Following the algorithm's success in yielding high quality reconstructed images given adequately balanced channels, focus is turned to balancing alternatives, with special interest in methods applicable to aliased data.

40|$|Shallow gas and {{overpressure}} {{are potential}} drilling hazards, and detailed mapping of such risks {{must be done}} prior to drilling to prevent loss of money, damage to equipment, and in the worst case, accidents on personnel. In the shallow part of the sediments of the North Sea glacial deposits create networks of possible porous and permeable rock. These rocks can act as reservoirs for shallow gas, trapped in the subglacial forms, overlaid by impermeable till and glacial and marine clay. Amplitude variation with offset (AVO) and {{amplitude variation with offset}} and azimuth (AVAZ) measurements have been performed on a tunnel valley, an esker, a channel system and other amplitude anomalies in an area above the Edvard Grieg Field in the Central North Sea. High Resolution 3 D (HR 3 D) data have been used. Detailed interpretations have revealed several subglacial forms not detectable on conventional seismic, including narrow tributary tunnel valleys, eskers and glacial lakes. Geophysical methods, combined with AVO modelling using Smith and Gidlows approximation, have been used as tools to detect if these deposits contain shallow gas and represent drilling hazards. The results also contribute to the geological understanding of subglacial deposition. The high quality HR 3 D site survey has been compared to a conventional near stacked cube and a BroadSeis survey. The comparison shows the significance of the HR 3 D cube, but also its limitations. The importance of using high quality data will be discussed, as {{it may not be a}} necessary solution compared to the advantages of other data types. The results indicate gas and/or overpressure in the glacial channel network. The lithology variations related to the esker show an anomaly which can be related to a minor gas saturation. The upper tunnel valley sediments does not show an AVO response related to fluid changes. However, variations in lithology support the theory of tunnel valleys being formed by several episodes of erosion and deposition, creating composite tunnel valleys. AVAZ and wide azimuth measurements on the top tunnel valley interface support this, as anisotropy is indicated in the upper part of the tunnel valley infill. However, AVAZ modelling does not support this affirmation. The measurements are contaminated by several sources of uncertainty, making the results questionable. Both statistical data processing effects, related to <b>channel</b> <b>balancing,</b> and deterministic modelling effects like mode conversions, focusing effects, transmission losses, geometrical spreading and tuning, implicate the response. Due to the size of the measured anomalies, the Fresnel zone plays an important part in the apprehension of the measurements. </p...|$|E
