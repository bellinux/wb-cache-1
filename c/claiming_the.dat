5|$|Despite <b>claiming</b> <b>the</b> premiership in 1945, Eastern Suburbs {{failed to}} make the finals for the {{following}} seven seasons. A runners-up finish in 1960 was the closest the club came to <b>claiming</b> <b>the</b> premiership during this era. Eastern Suburbs were soundly defeated 31–6 in the grand final that year, by the famous record-beating St George outfit. In 1966, the club fell to new depths and was winless {{for the first time in}} its history. It was also the last occasion in which the Roosters won the wooden spoon until claiming it again in the 2009 season. It ended a poor run for Eastern Suburbs; from 1963 to 1966, they won 8 of 72 matches, finishing second to last in 1964 and last in the other three years. The club underwent a renaissance in 1967 after appointing Jack Gibson as coach (1967–68), and introducing a new emblem on the playing jerseys, the rooster.|$|E

The jury decided for the Fellows, supporting the original charter of Edward II.|$|E
