The <b>cross</b> <b>talk</b> cancellation ability, which is defined as the <b>cross</b> <b>talk</b> power ratio before cancellation to after cancellation in decibel, is analyzed and its closed-form expression is derived. Simulation results prove that the ICTC-DPD can achieve higher <b>cross</b> <b>talk</b> estimation accuracy and higher <b>cross</b> <b>talk</b> cancellation ability than the original CTC-DPD.

We compared results obtained for these two indicators, considering windows in which a <b>cross</b> <b>talks</b> event between HR and ICP was detected with windows in which <b>cross</b> <b>talks</b> events were not present.

More specifically we observed {{an increase in the}} value of the mutual interaction in the case of <b>cross</b> <b>talk</b> as compared to non <b>cross</b> <b>talk.</b> This seems to suggest that mutual interaction could be a potentially interesting “marker” for <b>cross</b> <b>talks</b> events.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{assessment of}} image quality {{is essential for}} design of imaging systems. Barrett and Gifford [1] introduced the Fourier <b>cross</b> <b>talk</b> matrix. Because it is diagonal for continuous linear shift-invariant imaging systems, the Fourier <b>cross</b> <b>talk</b> matrix is a powerful technique for discrete imaging systems that are close to shift invariant. However, for {{a system that is}} intrinsically shift variant, Fourier techniques are not particularly effective. Because Fourier bases have no localization property, the shift-variance of the imaging system cannot be shown by the response of individual Fourier bases; rather, it is shown in the correlation between the Fourier coefficients. This makes the analysis and optimization quite difficult. In this paper, we introduce a wavelet <b>cross</b> <b>talk</b> matrix based on wavelet series expansions. The wavelet <b>cross</b> <b>talk</b> matrix allows simultaneous study of the imaging system in both the frequency and spatial domains. Hence it is well suited for shift variant systems. We compared the wavelet <b>cross</b> <b>talk</b> matrix with the Fourier <b>cross</b> <b>talk</b> matrix for several simulated imaging systems, namely the interior and exterior tomography problems, limited angle tomography, and a rectangular geometry positron emission tomograph. The results demonstrate the advantages of the wavelet <b>cross</b> <b>talk</b> matrix in analyzing shift-variant imaging systems...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAmong {{the current}} {{challenges}} of the tactile sensor for soft tissue stiffness detection is to get an output reading independent of the pushing distance between the senor and the tissue. Although a sensor with two probes configuration is used, the sensor output shows dependency on the pushing distance due to a <b>cross</b> <b>talk</b> effect between the two probes. To address this problem, a new compensation technique was proposed. It utilizes a tissue deformation effect in stiffness measurement to compensate the error due to <b>cross</b> <b>talk</b> effect between the two probes. A finite element analysis for the sensor output using ANSYS was carried out to investigate the dependency of <b>cross</b> <b>talk</b> effect on the separation distance between the two probes, It was confirmed that the <b>cross</b> <b>talk</b> effect and the error in stiffness measurement during tissue deformation can compensate each other...|$|R

MGDM is an intensity modulation, direct detection, multiple-input, multiple-output technique that creates independent communication channels over a multimode fiber (MMF). The <b>cross</b> <b>talk</b> among the channels is mitigated electronically. However, by properly employing a lens between the output of a graded-index MMF and the detectors, we achieve mode-selective spatial filtering (MSSF) and optically reduce the <b>cross</b> <b>talk.</b> The robustness of the link is then increased when compared with an implementation without MSSF.
