5000|$|Caterpillar {{divisions}} {{have won}} Illinois Governor's Pollution Prevention Awards {{every year since}} 1997. [...] Caterpillar was awarded the 2007 Illinois Governor's Pollution Prevention Award for three projects: The Hydraulics and Hydraulic Systems business unit in Joliet implemented a flame sprayed coating for its truck suspension system, replacing a <b>chroming</b> process, reducing hazardous waste by 700,000 pounds annually and saving [...] of water. Caterpillar's Cast Metals Organization in Mapleton worked with the American Foundry Society to help produce a rule to reduce hazardous waste in scrap metal that meet strict quality requirements, and also allow foundries to continue recycling certain types of scrap and maintain a competitive cost structure. Caterpillar's Mossville Engine Center formed a team to look at used oil re-use and recycle processes that forced MEC to send large amounts of used oil off-site for recycling, and developed an updated system for reclaiming it for re-use on-site. The resulting benefits included a usage reduction of about 208,000 gal of oil per year.|$|E
50|$|In the US, ether {{was used}} as a {{recreational}} drug during the 1930s Prohibition era, when alcohol was made illegal. Ether was either sniffed or drunk and, in some towns, replaced alcohol entirely. However, the risk of death from excessive sedation or overdose is greater than that with alcohol, and ether drinking is associated with damage to the stomach and gastrointestinal tract. Use of glue, paint and gasoline became more common after the 1950s. Abuse of aerosol sprays became more common in the 1980s, as older propellants such as CFCs were phased out and replaced by more environmentally friendly compounds such as propane and butane. Most inhalant solvents and gases are not regulated under drug laws such as the United States' Controlled Substances Act. However, many US states and Canadian cities have placed restrictions on the sale of some solvent-containing products to minors, particularly for products widely associated with sniffing, such as model cement. The practice of inhaling such substances is sometimes colloquially referred to as huffing, sniffing (or glue sniffing), dusting, or <b>chroming.</b>|$|E
50|$|Merwin Hulbert {{manufactured}} both single-action and double-action revolvers. Merwin Hulbert's innovation was {{a rotating}} barrel design which allowed {{the user to}} rotate the barrel 90 degrees in order to pull the barrel and cylinder forward to remove the fired cartridge cases. The Merwin Hulbert revolvers {{were considered to be}} the strongest revolvers during the time period in which they were made by Arthur Corbin Gould. During the twisting motion, the empty case could be extracted. Any intact cartridge would remain in the chamber due to the additional length of the bullet. In addition to this unique case extraction system, pressing an additional lever control when the frame was 'open' for extraction allowed the owner to completely remove the barrel. Note: early models also required pushing out a barrel wedge similar in function to Colt percussion revolvers. This not only facilitated cleaning, but allowed the owner to swap barrels, allowing for a shorter 'concealed carry' and longer 'field' weapon in one. The combination of extraction and barrel removal required very precise manufacturing tolerances—incredible considering the tools of the day. Additionally, Merwin & Hulbert developed a <b>chroming</b> process superior to competitors, which was even less expensive than providing bluing. The chrome acting to protect the metal surfaces from corrosion, and looks pretty sharp. Because chrome Merwin and Hulbert pistols had the same cost as those without, it is rare to find Merwin and Hulbert revolvers with a blued finish.|$|E
50|$|Despite Reyle’s ongoing {{commitment}} to abstraction, {{he is currently}} experimenting with representational motives. Indeed, in his recent works, Reyle playfully explores {{the origin of the}} figure by explicitly referencing the tradition of “paint-by-numbers,” thereby revealing the way abstract forms can coalesce and become recognizable subjects from life. By using a strategy such as seen in paint-by-numbers, the subject matter is dissected in single, serially numbered parts like a puzzle where each number is assigned a certain color that is in interaction with other fields. These are then filled in with materials or colors that the viewer can recognize from the Reyle repertoire, as in the stripe paintings or Otto-Freundlich-series. This juxtaposition creates the impression of a plastic relief {{with a wide range of}} surface textures which directly appeals to the viewer’s sense of touch. The most well-known sculptures of Anselm Reyle are the so-called „African sculptures“. The original forms and titles for these work groups are borrowed from tourist markets and the kitschy flea market handicrafts - often made from soapstone - that are sold as clichés of African sculpture. Set on a low-lying Macassar wooden plinth, his piece Harmony (2007) is based on a small soapstone sculpture his mother purchased on a visit to Africa. While cheap and derivative, in their formal conception these forms recall the prominent abstract sculptors of modern art like Hans Arp, Alexander Archipenko and Henry Moore. The distinct influence of European sculpture on these African knick-knacks manifests itself in this suggested prototype of modern plastic art. Reyle uses traditional techniques; enlarging the original found object before casting it in bronze, <b>chroming</b> and lacquering it. This process creates a work with great tension as the traditional hand sculptural technique is contrasted with the highly engineered bronze work. The viewer’s foreknowledge of the techniques that Reyle underwent to create and transform the object is vital to communicate this intentional paradox.|$|E

40|$|A major {{national}} review in 2006 noted that volatile substance use (VSU) {{is an issue}} in both Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities in Australia. The review found that 2 ̆ 7 <b>chroming</b> 2 ̆ 7 (inhaling spray paint) and petrol sniffing are two forms of inhalant abuse that are currently common in Australia, with the practice of <b>chroming</b> being more common in urban and rural areas, while petrol sniffing {{is more common in}} remote Indigenous communities. The purpose of this review is to summarise key information from a number of substantial reports and other documents to make it more accessible to people involved in Indigenous health in Australia. This review focuses on Australian Indigenous people with the focus on petrol sniffing, since that form of VSU is predominant among Indigenous people in Australia. After summarising briefly the nature of volatile substances and their impacts when inhaled by people, the review summarises the use both generally and among Indigenous people in Australia, and the impacts of their use among Indigenous people. Attention is then directed to methods for responding to their use in Indigenous communities, in terms of supply reduction, demand reduction, harm reduction and law enforcement, before providing some concluding comments. While some {{progress has been made in}} combating VSU, including the provision of safer products (such as Opal fuel), further work remains to address the underlying social determinants of VSU and other deleterious health behaviours by taking measures to redress the socio-economic disadvantage experienced by Indigenous communities...|$|E
30|$|The {{corrosion}} resistance of powder materials used as reinforcing phases in composite electrochemical coatings (CEP) {{is an important}} characteristic defining the fundamental possibility of their obtaining. Dissolution of powders in electrolyte solutions leads to deterioration of the electrolysis conditions which imposes significant process limitation {{on the use of}} each specific material for the CEP obtaining [4, 5, 7]. Analysis of available data shows [8] that a number of studies in which no dissolution of hardening phases (borides) were taken into account contain inaccuracies, and the neglecting of this fact by the author of [6] led to excessively wide advertising of dispersion hardening processes realized in <b>chroming</b> electrolytes containing zirconium diboride. Therefore, study of {{corrosion resistance}} of powders of refractory compounds is an important task, and investigation of their nanostates poses a scientific problem as well. Urgent need for such research is also {{due to the lack of}} information on this subject. Only in [2], there is evidence of stability in acid solutions of nanostructured nitride-boride composites of titanium and zirconium.|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} rapid method is {{described}} for the staining of neural end {{feet in the}} central nervous system. In this technique, paraffin sections of routinely fixed central nervous tissue are dewaxed and mordanted in 10 % potassium dichromate at 58 °C for 1 - 2 hr, and impregnated for 45 min at 58 °C in a 2 % silver nitrate solution. Staining {{takes place in a}} silver gelatin reducer; the sections may be gold toned if necessary. By adding 2 % chromium fluoride to the <b>chroming</b> solution, it is possible to stain the mitochondria. By completely omitting the mordanting step, a general impregnation of neurofibrils is obtained. Since the cells and their nuclei are not impregnated by this method, sections may be counterstained by any basic anilin dye to bring out the Nissl bodies. A 1 % toluidine blue solution buffered at pH 3. 0 was found very satisfactory in this respect. This technique was successfully applied to all parts of the central nervous system including the cerebral cortex. SCOPUS: ar. jSCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

Searches are developed to meet the processes that take place in <b>chroming,</b> including NIKASILÃÂ, a process based on nickel and silicon carbide (SiC), also due to problems caused by allergens nickel, has been minimized their industrial application. This work aimed to study and develop a process of metal coating the basis of Nb 2 O 5, carbon nanotubes (NTC) and silicon carbide (SiC), AA 3003 aluminum alloy for replacing the Cr-based treatments 6. This study employed electrochemical techniques and not electrochemical such as: experimental design, anodic potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry, X-ray fluorescence, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, abrasion and deformation. The experimental results showed that the most effective coating based Nb 2 O 5 obtained by the Pechini method, the conditions were: 5 minutes of immersion and emersion into the polymer resin, a speed of 12 cm min- 1, with an initial heat treatment by 60 minute at 100 ÃÂ C followed by 20 minutes at 450 ÃÂ C. The sol gel molar ratio was 1 : 4 (citric acid / ethylene glycol) and acid and niobium ammonium complex of 10 : 1 (n/n). The morphology of the film formed is homogeneous and comprises organic matter and Nb 2 O 5. Better corrosion resistance is obtained with the proposed Nb 2 O 5 coating, compared to surface treatment Cr+ 6, suggesting a possible replacement of coating. The addition of SiC NTC and the process of obtaining the Nb 2 O 5 film promotes minimizing the corrosion resistance of the coating, however, increases the hardness and abrasive wear resistance thereof. EIS measurements showed that the film generated Nb 2 O 5 have not the same self-healing of the base film of Cr+ 6, however, it was observed that for the coated substrate Nb 2 O 5 times until to 96 hours of immersion in the test electrolyte, the strength values were recorded in the order of 105 ohms cm 2 higher than those of Cr+ 6 coating, and immersion until to 96 hours for coating scratched Nb 2 O 5 impedance values were higher than those of Cr+ 6 coating...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{and explains}} the social worlds {{of a group}} of young Murris who are engaged in <b>chroming</b> (paint sniffing) and who sleep rough in inner Brisbane. In particular, the paper considers the ways young Indigenous drug users describe their marginalisation from wider society and its structures of opportunity, but it also includes some reflections from their youth worker and a young man who frequents the young people’s squat. The paper demonstrates the centrality of racism and material disadvantage to the experience {{of a group of}} young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander sniffers, a perspective largely unreflected in the literature on Indigenous volatile substance misuse. Further, the young people’s ways of interacting with the broader society are described to explain the ways their rejection of mainstream norms form a significant political response to their marginality and reflect, at least in part, the wider Indigenous historical experience. The work draws on theories of alienation and subculture to analyse the young people’s descriptions of their social estrangement and the formation of the ‘paint sniffer group’. It is concluded that paint sniffing among urban Indigenous youth is, at least in part, an obnoxious and encoded distillation of a wider Indigenous rebuttal of broader societal norms, and that the dominant — normalising — modes of treatment risk further alienating an already oppositional group of young people...|$|E
40|$|The police play an {{important}} role in the control of drug and alcohol problems in entertainment districts. Their role, however, in partnership approaches to crime control in entertainment districts is not well understood. In this paper, we explore how a police-led partnership (the Liquor Enforcement and Proactive Strategies programme – LEAPS) shaped licensed venue managers 2 ̆ 7 and owners 2 ̆ 7 (whom we refer to as ‘place managers’) perceptions of crime and disorder and how LEAPS then activates place managers to take some responsibility for controlling crime and disorder problems. Using a survey of the population of place managers in an entertainment district in Brisbane, Australia before and after the implementation of LEAPS, our study reveals that place managers perceived a decrease in drug use, prostitution and <b>chroming,</b> yet perceptions of the incidence of underage drinking, social disorder and fighting increased. Results also show an increase in the number of self-reported proactive behaviours taken by place managers who considered illicit and licit drugs to be a problem. Results suggest that the role of place managers is instrumental for enhancing police responses to drug and alcohol problems in entertainment districts. We conclude that LEAPS officers are well placed to co-opt place managers into taking further responsibility for crime problems in and around their drinking establishments...|$|E
40|$|WO 200272924 A UPAB: 20030214 NOVELTY - <b>Chroming</b> {{apparatus}} comprises: (1) {{a working}} anode(s) for deposition; and (2) a separate oxidation anode(s), for oxidation of the Chromium (III) ions to Chromium (IV) ions, {{that is an}} electrode with a conductive diamond coating on a substrate. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a chromating process, in which different anodes are used for deposition and oxidation of Chromium (III) ions to Chromium (IV) ions, in which the oxidation anode as above is used. USE - Used for regenerating solutions containing chromic acid by anodic oxidation of Chromium (III) to Chromium (IV) in electrolytic chromating baths, which are used for electroplating, chromation, etching e. g. acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) plastics and anodizing e. g. aluminum. ADVANTAGE - Chromium plating is normally carried out with lead anodes, which combine a double function, as counter-electrode (working electrode) and oxidation anode. In anodic operation, it becomes coated with lead dioxide. However, lead anodes form sludge and have limited dimensional stability. Various coated titanium anodes avoid this problem but have other drawbacks, including the need to add lead. The novel apparatus with the diamond-coated oxidation anode ensures effective oxidation of Chromium (III) to Chromium (IV) without costly maintenance procedures. The process is flexible and simple, even with complex geometries and structures, e. g. internal in plating of pipes and it eliminates the need to add lead and its associated drawbacks...|$|E

40|$|This thesis was {{completed}} in partial fulfilment of the Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree program at Queensland University of Technology. This thesis explores the purposes and practice of the Queensland police move-on powers, a topic which, to date, has been largely unexplored in social research. Move-on powers are powers {{that are used to}} direct persons to leave a specified place, typically a public space, {{on the basis of their}} behaviour and/or presence. While such powers exist in multiple jurisdictions in Australia and overseas, the Queensland police move-on powers are the primary focus of this research. A triangulated method of gathering information was applied in this research. A quantitative content analysis was utilised to identify the espoused and underlying purposes of the Queensland police move-on powers as provided by the Queensland State Government. Qualitative semi-structured interviewing was utilised to explore how frontline witnesses to the Queensland police move-on powers describe the purposes and practice of these powers, as well as establish a platform for how the Queensland police move-on powers and their practice could be further investigated. Existing academic research and anecdotal reports have indicated that the Queensland police move-on powers are being practiced for purposes other than those stated explicitly by the Queensland State Government as to how the powers would be used. The findings of this thesis indicate that the Queensland police move-on powers are being disproportionately applied to marginalised demographic groups, specifically young people, homeless people, Indigenous people and people with a mental illness. Furthermore, the powers are being used to move on persons for behaviours – namely <b>chroming</b> and experiencing an episode of mental illness in public – that were not presented by the Government as purposes of the powers. The incongruence between the purposes and practice of these powers is explained using espoused theory versus theory in- use and front-line bureaucracy theory (Argyris & Schon, 1974; Lipsky, 1980). As this thesis explores the move-on powers from sociological, public space management and policy implementation perspectives, its findings have potential implications for policy development and policing...|$|E
