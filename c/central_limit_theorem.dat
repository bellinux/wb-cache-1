5|$|Markov {{processes}} and Markov chains are named after Andrey Markov who studied Markov chains {{in the early}} 20th century. Markov was interested in studying an extension of independent random sequences. In his first paper on Markov chains, published in 1906, Markov showed that under certain conditions the average outcomes of the Markov chain would converge to a fixed vector of values, so proving a weak law of large numbers without the independence assumption, which had been commonly regarded as a requirement for such mathematical laws to hold. Markov later used Markov chains to study the distribution of vowels in Eugene Onegin, written by Alexander Pushkin, and proved a <b>central</b> <b>limit</b> <b>theorem</b> for such chains.|$|E

The distribution of the sum (or average) of the rolled numbers will be well approximated by a normal distribution. Since real-world quantities are often the balanced sum of many unobserved random events, the <b>central</b> <b>limit</b> <b>theorem</b> also provides a partial explanation for the prevalence of the normal probability distribution. It also justifies the approximation of large-sample statistics to the normal distribution in controlled experiments.|$|E

Constructing the confidence intervals or sets requires understanding the sampling distributions {{of the point}} estimators, which, in many but not all cases, are related to asymptotic Normal distributions ensured by <b>central</b> <b>limit</b> <b>theorems.</b> Although previous literature has established various forms of <b>central</b> <b>limit</b> <b>theorems</b> for statistical inference in super population models, we still need general and convenient forms of <b>central</b> <b>limit</b> <b>theorems</b> for some randomization-based causal analysis of experimental data, where the parameters of interests are functions of a finite population and randomness comes solely from the treatment assignment. We use <b>central</b> <b>limit</b> <b>theorems</b> for sample surveys and rank statistics to establish general forms of the finite population <b>central</b> <b>limit</b> <b>theorems</b> that are particularly useful for proving asymptotic distributions of randomization tests under the sharp null hypothesis of zero individual causal effects, and for obtaining the asymptotic repeated sampling distributions of the causal effect estimators. The new <b>central</b> <b>limit</b> <b>theorems</b> hold for general experimental designs with multiple treatment levels and multiple treatment factors, and are immediately applicable for studying the asymptotic properties of many methods in causal inference, including instrumental variable, regression adjustment, rerandomization, clustered randomized experiments, and so on. Previously, the asymptotic properties of these problems are often based on heuristic arguments, which in fact rely on general forms of finite population <b>central</b> <b>limit</b> <b>theorems</b> {{that have not been}} established before.
