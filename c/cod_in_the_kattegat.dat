40|$|Evaluations of {{the effects}} of {{management}} measures on fish populations are usually based on the analyses of population dynamics and estimates of fishing mortality from stock assessments. However, this approach may not be applicable in all cases, in particular for data limited stocks, which may suffer from uncertain catch information and consequently lack reliable estimates of fishing mortality. In this study we develop an approach to obtain proxies for changes in fishing mortality based on effort information and predicted stock distribution. <b>Cod</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kattegat</b> is used as an example. We use GAM analyses to predict local cod densities and combine this with spatio-temporal data of fishing effort based on VMS (Vessel Monitoring System). To quantify local fishing impact on the stock, retention probability of the gears is taken into account. The results indicate a substantial decline in the impact of Danish demersal trawl fleet on <b>cod</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kattegat</b> in recent years, due to a combination of closed areas, introduction of selective gears and changes in overall effort...|$|E

40|$|For {{the early}} life stages of fish, the {{dispersal}} and retention are important factors regarding {{present and future}} survivorship, growth and reproduction. The main objective of this thesis is to analyse fish egg and larval transport in two different marine systems, the Kattegat and the North Atlantic. The focus is on two different species, namely Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) eggs in the Kattegat-Öresund-Belt area and European eel (Anguilla anguilla) leptocephalus larvae in the North Atlantic. The stock of <b>cod</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kattegat</b> has been severely depleted due to fishery and is presently classified as exhibiting reduced reproductive capacity. It is, therefore, of interest to update information on cod spawning activity and get {{an understanding of the}} dispersal of eggs. As to evaluate spawning, data were analysed from dedicated egg surveys in the Kattegat between 2004 and 2006. Genetically identified cod eggs confirmed that cod were spawning in the studied area during the sampling period. The estimated daily egg production was high in the south-eastern part of the surveyed area (~ 20 eggs m- 2 d- 1) while it was low (0 – 5 eggs m- 2 d- 1) in the central and northern part. This emphasises the importance of the southernmost spawning area in the Kattegat, close to the Öresund. A process oriented model was used to investigate transport of cod eggs and early larvae in relation to egg density as well as how the interannual variation of retention and dispersal is related to the meteorological forcing. The model results clearly indicated that transport is highly dependent on the egg density; lighter eggs are transported northwards, whereas heavier eggs are retained to a larger extent or are transported southwards. An optimum of retention is defined in the density range 1023 - 1026 kg m- 3. Combining the model results of the amount of retention, distribution and sedimentation with observations of vertical distribution of cod-like eggs in the range 1017 - 1022 kg m- 3, suggests that gadoid eggs are mainly retained in the southern Kattegat, but also simultaneously dispersed northwards. Further investigation showed that interannual variation of retention, transport and sedimentation are highly correlated to the changes of local wind forcing. Strong westerly winds induce southward transport and high sedimentation while weak variable winds tend to retain eggs in the spawning area. The results of this study provide a starting point for future studies of spawning and life history characteristics of the Kattegat cod, and also in studies designed to entangle the stock complex in the Kattegat-Öresund-Belt area. Climatic variation affecting the ocean conditions for passive drift of eel larvae is one of the factors suspected {{to be related to the}} decline of eel recruitment. A simple Lagrangian model was used to simulate the passive drift of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) leptocephalus larvae from the spawning area in the Sargasso Sea to the European shelf (20 °W). The simulation utilised the velocity data from a reanalysis of ocean climate, the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA 2. 1. 6), for the period from 1958 to 2008. The period which was modelled covers the time of a regime shift in eel recruitment in the 1980 s. The average drift time and latitudinal distribution of the arrival of larvae (particles in the model) was explored for a range of constant depth levels and instantaneous mortalities. The model showed that the proportion of eel larvae carried by the North-east Atlantic current to northern latitudes of arrival was greater before 1970 whereas there was an increase in amount of eel larvae being entrained into the southbound current branches in later part of simulation. The overall success of drift from the spawning area to the eastern Atlantic clearly contradicts that this could explain the dramatic recruitment decline...|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the complicated}} patterns of vertical distribution of <b>the</b> macroalgal vegetation <b>in</b> {{an area where}} brackish and marine waters meet and mix. Variables used to record vegetation characteristics are algal cover, species composition and diversity. The data set includes 64 diving profiles, all from sites exposed to wave action, along a ca. 260 km long coastline. The profiles belong to four categories: coastal sites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Skagerrak (more marine), coastal sites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kattegat</b> (more brackish), coastal sites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kattegat</b> after a toxic phytoplankton bloom, and submerged offshore stone reefs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kattegat.</b> <b>The</b> highest species diversity was found at the reefs, which are not affected directly by land runoff. At the reefs the 18 most common perennial species penetrate 2 – 11 m (on average 5. 5 m) deeper than at the coastal sites. The virtual absence of sedimentation, and thus the availability of substratum, at the reefs may explain the differences so that the lower limit for the algae is determined by light penetration or by recruitment problems caused by strong currents at the reefs, whereas sedimentation limits the settlement of algae in coastal sites. Ordination analysis based on species composition reveals that the major environmental gradients structuring <b>the</b> algal vegetation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kattegat</b> and <b>the</b> Skagerrak are salinity and water depth.

The foraminiferal content of seven piston and three vibrocores were analysed. Radiocarbon dates were obtained from four of the cores. Relatively warm water masses occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shallow areas of <b>the</b> <b>Kattegat</b> during <b>the</b> late Younger Dryas and early Preboreal, while cold, arctic/ subarctic water masses occurred in deeper parts of <b>the</b> <b>Kattegat</b> and Skagerrak. Full interglacial temperature conditions developed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern <b>Kattegat</b> at 9600 BP. A sea-level rise is recorded at 9600 - 8200 BP, a period during which the Skagerrak-Kattegat area experienced a gradual warming.

40|$|Bottom {{trawling}} {{can change}} food availability for benthivorous demersal species by (i) changing benthic prey composition through physical seabed impacts and (ii) by removing overall benthic consumer biomass increasing the net availability of benthic prey for remaining individuals. Thus trawling may both negatively and positively influence {{the quantity and}} quality of food available. Using δ 13 C and δ 15 N we investigated potential diet changes of three commercially exploited species across trawling gradients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kattegat</b> (plaice, dab and Norway lobster (Nephrops)) and the Irish Sea (Nephrops). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kattegat,</b> trawling affected primarily the biomass of benthic consumers, lowering competition. Nephrops showed significant positive relationships for δ 13 C and a domed relationship for δ 15 N with trawling. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Irish Sea, intense trawling had a negative effect on benthic prey. δ 13 C and δ 15 N thus showed the inverse relationships to those observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kattegat.</b> Plaice from <b>the</b> <b>Kattegat,</b> showed a significant relationship with trawling intensity for δ 13 C, but not for δ 15 N. No relationship was found for dab. Changes of δ 13 C and δ 15 N correlated with changes in condition of species. The results show that the removal of demersal competitors and benthos by trawling can change the diets of commercial species, ultimately affecting their body conditionVersión del edito...|$|R

Frontal mixing and movements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kattegat</b> and <b>the</b> entrance area of the Arkona Basin were important to consider <b>in</b> <b>the</b> model.
