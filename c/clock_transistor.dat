The design of high-performance and low-power clocked storage elements is essential and critical to achieving maximum levels of performance and reliability in modern VLSI systems such as Systems on Chips (SoCs). In this thesis, a pulse-clocked double edge-triggered D-flip-flop (PDET) is proposed. PDET uses a new split-output true single-phase clocked (TSPC) latch and when clocked by a short pulse train acts like a double edge-triggered flip-flop. The P-type version of the new TSPC split-output latch is compared with existing TSPC split-output latches in terms of robustness, area, and power efficiency at high-speeds. It is shown that the new split-output latch is more area-power efficient, and significantly more robust, than the existing split-output CMOS latches. The novel double edge-triggered flip-flop uses only eight transistors with only one N-type <b>transistor</b> being <b>clocked.</b> Compared to other double edge-triggered flip-flops, PDET offers advantages in terms of speed, power, and area.
