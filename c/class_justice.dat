5000|$|Melbourne {{had been}} slowly {{recovering}} {{from the effects of}} a land boom and all the public schools had suffered and Wesley's troubles had been greater than all others. When Adamson took charge only one hundred boys of the previous year had returned to school. By the end of the year, 243 were on the roll and the attendance gradually rose until it reached 600 in 1930. Adamson wanted no more because he did not believe in large public schools, and always held that it was impossible for the head to know the boys in a school whose numbers were much over 500. While promoting scholarship, Adamson encouraged athletics at Wesley and quickly set up an ideal of sportsmanship of which the keynote was that boys should learn to 'win decently and lose decently'. He advocated good manners with pithy illustrations on the effect of them, he instilled a sense of honour, he believed in hero-worship, but all the while he was mindful of practical things. His school was the first to have medical examinations for all boys, and the knowledge of a boy's physical condition was applied to his work in <b>class.</b> <b>Justice</b> was the basis of all his work, and he became not only efficient as a headmaster but thoroughly popular with the boys. There was no want of respect in his nickname [...] "Dicky" [...] and there was a really genuine affection.|$|E

40|$|The {{action of}} the French Groupe d’information sur les prisons (GIP) in the early 1970 s has {{recently}} been characterized as “optical activism”. By analogy, this article considers the activist efforts of the GIP from the angle of statistical activism or “statactivism”. It assumes {{that there is something}} to be gained from re-examining the GIP’s activities from this perspective on the assumption that, because prison was —particularly at that time— a place of deprivation and scarcity, it was a world in which quantities, however low they may have been, did count. Quantification was not the most important of the GIP’s wide range of activities; yet it was crucial under certain circumstances, or for addressing certain issues: if information was "a weapon" (a watchword of the group), then statistical information was no exception to the rule. Emphasizing the issues of prison suicides and <b>class</b> <b>justice,</b> this article reviews different practices of statactivism, from challenging official figures to resorting to an original quantification operation. If the GIP paved the way for a critique that is now commonplace, it has also brought about a decisive and paradoxical shift, by which citing numbers no longer only answered the conventional quantitative question “how many?” (how many prisoners?), but also answered the qualitative and more disturbing question “who?”: who are the prisoners...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 160 - 167). This Master's Research Project {{has sought}} to investigate the discursive space for 'gender struggles' within contemporary South African class based social justice activism. It has done so {{in the form of}} a qualitative case study, analysing particular 'gender' interventions designed by a left-wing popular education organisation during 2006, and how these are theorized and contextualised against this specific moment in time in post-apartheid South Africa. The research has looked at how and why the organisation is presently trying to challenge gendered power inequalities in its internal and external work, strengthening women activists in the Community-based organisations and Social Movements which it targets, and contribute to putting women's strategic gender interests on the agenda of these movements, while simultaneously seeking to theorize the meaning of 'political' gender work in relation to its dominant perspective of <b>class</b> <b>justice.</b> The researcher has followed a specific empowerment initiative targeting women activists during the year, and has also engaged closely with the institutional dynamics in the organisation under study. The data has been gathered through interviews with staff members and women activists, and through participatory observation in educational events and office meetings. The theoretical framework for the study was designed in relation to Shireen Hassim's investigations of the "discursive space" for South African feminist groups to articulate their demands while continuing to work within the dominant, male-led resistance movements (Hassim, 2006 : 14 - 19), and to Amanda Gouws' theorizing of citizenship as including 'embodied' participation in political processes and activism (Gouws, 2005 : 1 - 16, 71 - 87). It furthermore builds on contemporary theories on social movements and grassroots mobilisation in South Africa (recaptured by Ballard et. aI., 2006 : 3 - 19), on feminist consciousness-raising (Kaplan, 1997) and on organisational change for gender equality (Rao and Kelleher, 2003). Some of the suggestions made, while analysing the data against this theoretical framework, include; That the conflict which has emerged in the organisation under study in relation to the new 'gender programme' is indeed a contestation over the meaning of 'political' gender work, and over who can be a legitimate 'political actor' (Hassim, 2006 : 17); simultaneously and contradictive, there is an awareness in the organisations that the nature of the 'working class' is shifting in pace with neo-liberal globalisation processes, and that rank-and-file members in working class organisations are now the unemployed or the casual workers, a majority of them being women (although leadership structures largely remain male territory), which theoretically should also prompt a shift in the focal organisations approach to 'political' gender work, but in practice, this is still a struggle; the empowerment programme which the research has followed closely throughout the year has led to women participants being ostracised, after surfacing issues of sexual harassment in the movements, but the rational/intellectual, spiritual and emotional learning which has happened in the group is analyzed as having been empowering on both an individual and collective level, inspiring new women's network to develop within movements of both men and women. The study suggests that engaging 'gender' and expanding the notion of 'political work' and who can be a 'political actor' is crucial if left-wing education and support organisations seek to remain relevant within a rapidly changing context...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three distinct but interrelated chapters. The (1) first chapter explores {{the current state of}} employment litigation in federal district courts using Administrative Office of the U. S. Courts data, which represents the universe of all civil claims filed and disposed of in federal court. The remaining chapters analyze data collected from a nationwide survey of over 1, 200 practicing employment lawyer members of the National Employment Lawyers Association (NELA) and the California Employment Lawyers Association (CELA). The (2) second chapter examines how forums in which individual employment rights are heard- in civil courts or arbitration-influence employee remedies in discrimination claims using attorney descriptions of their most recent cases taken to adjudication in both forums. The (3) third chapter investigates how individual plaintiff characteristics and the institutional and organizational environments of claims affect the case selection decisions of employment plaintiff attorneys using attorney responses to vignettes. Each chapter is briefly summarized below. Chapter 1 : Employment Litigation in Federal District Court The New Deal system of labor relations accurately depicted industrial relations in the mid-twentieth century, but is no longer plausible today. Indeed, the collective system of employee representation has been precipitously declining for nearly a half-century and private sector unionization rates have fallen below 7 percent today. Yet as the traditional system of labor relations based on unionization has declined, individual employment rights and litigation have expanded dramatically. In fact, federal employment discrimination claims increased more than 300 percent between the late 1970 s and 2000. Despite this growth in employment law, too many fundamental questions about this system remain unanswered. This chapter illuminates essential characteristics of the employment rights regime by investigating federal district courts outcomes. I rely on the "Federal Court Cases: Integrated Database Series," comprising the universe of cases disposed in federal court between 1990 through 2012. With these data, I provide a broad-based, systematic examination of the nature of general civil litigation in federal courts. Specifically, I report on: (1) the quantity of employment litigation in the U. S.; (2) types of claims being filed; (3) how claims are being resolved; (4) time to proceed from filing to disposition; (5) employee outcomes - dispositions and award amounts, along with other analyses. Employment litigation has seen an across-the-board decline since the late 1990 s, with the only category of cases to defy this trend being wage and hour claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). While class action litigation spiked {{at the turn of the}} century, a decline immediately followed. Here again, FLSA is the exception to the rule: FLSA class action filings have continued to soar through 2012 with no indication a crest has formed. Over time, fewer and fewer employee plaintiffs are receiving adjudications through trial. Curiously, despite a 25 percent reduction in total civil filings over the past 10 years and a dwindling reliance on the terminal stage of adjudication, the average time between filing and dispositions for tried cases has been increasing, standing at over 2 years in 2012. The fewer employee plaintiffs who do proceed to trial have experienced relatively stable success rates, maintaining distinct differences between plaintiffs' win rates in wage and hour, employment civil rights, and all other civil claims. Finally, award amounts in civil rights cases have steadily outpaced inflation while FLSA awards have stayed constant in inflation-adjusted dollars. This research provides industrial relations scholars with a better understanding of the current era where statutory employment rights, not unions, are the key factors influencing the web of rules at work and circumscribing managerial prerogatives. Chapter 2 : Employment Discrimination Outcomes in Arbitration and Civil Litigation: A Tale of Two Forums In the wake of the Supreme Court's Gilmer decision in 1991, mandatory arbitration clauses, also known as "pre-dispute arbitration clauses," became an increasingly common fixture in employment agreements, applications, and handbooks in non-union organizations. As a condition of employment, employers require potential employees to waive their rights to resolve future legal claims through civil litigation in favor of resolution by private arbitration. To proponents, employment arbitration creates an accessible, expedient, and cheaper alternative to protracted civil litigation. To opponents, employment arbitration simply provides second <b>class</b> <b>justice</b> and a route for employers to escape liability under the law. The creation of a private, alternative forum for the resolution of individual employment rights is understandably provocative. Due to an inability to control for selection effects in publically available data, one of several lingering issues incident to arbitration is whether the forum in which a claim is heard-arbitration or civil courts-affects case outcomes. By surveying over 1, 200 attorneys directly about their most recent employment discrimination cases taken to verdict in arbitration and civil litigation, this chapter presents the first systematic empirical comparison of outcomes between civil courts and arbitration. The ability to control for the legal basis for the claim, defendant size, use of summary judgment, merits of claims, and attorney and plaintiff characteristics represents a significant improvement over previous empirical research studies. Consistent with previous research, employee win rates in arbitration are lower compared to those in state and federal court. In addition, monetary award amounts and percentage of claim amount awarded to successful employees are substantially lower in arbitration when compared to outcomes in jury trials in state and federal court. Improving on previous empirical analyses, I find these inferior outcomes cannot be explained by systematic differences in case, defendant, plaintiff, or attorney characteristics between forums. Mandatory arbitration's endorsement by the U. S. Supreme Court was premised on the idea that it simply involved an alternative set of procedures for enforcing the same set of substantive rights. By collecting a new dataset from employment lawyers, my dissertation contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence regarding arbitration's effects on employee outcomes and access to justice. Chapter 3 : How Do Plaintiff Characteristics, Organizational Environments, and Mandatory Arbitration Shape Employment Attorney Case Selection? Evidence from a Quasi-Experiment Relying on industrial relations theory and the "new institutionalist" literature in sociology, I posit that the organizational environment of a claim will affect plaintiff attorney assessments concerning whether a claim is meritorious and their willingness to accept a potential claim for representation. Industrial relation scholars have long argued that conflict in the workplace must be understood in light of the social relations of the work environment. This tracks the sociological view that discrimination is socially constructed through a process embedded in a larger organizational environment. Consequently, questionable employment actions taken against an employee will not be perceived in a vacuum, rather, the action will be viewed in the context of the firm's overall workplace conditions. Accepting this social construction, it follows that attorneys will be influenced by the organizational environment of claims as well. This is not to say that lawyers fail to evaluate the merits of a potential case; rather, various workplace policies can suggest non-discriminatory practices, legal compliance, and adherence to social norms, influencing whether an attorney (or other decision-maker) finds a particular claim credible and convincing. As part of the employment lawyer survey, respondents were asked to respond to a vignette with key plaintiff-level, organizational, and institutional variables randomly manipulated. Findings reveal that the expected value of a claim is central to attorney case selection decisions, the organizational environment of a claim can signal compliance with antidiscrimination law, and the use of mandatory arbitration reduces the expected value of a claim and the willingness an attorney will accept it for representation. These findings contribute to our understanding of antidiscrimination law as a social system and show that attorneys respond to economic incentives, are influenced by policies indicating legal compliance, and view claims with mandatory arbitration as equally meritorious but less desirable. 2020 - 08 - 1...|$|E
