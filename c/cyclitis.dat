50|$|Intermediate uveitis {{is a form}} of uveitis {{localized}} to the vitreous and peripheral retina. Primary {{sites of}} inflammation include the vitreous of which other such entities as pars planitis, posterior <b>cyclitis,</b> and hyalitis are encompassed. Intermediate uveitis may either be an isolated eye disease or associated with the development of a systemic disease such as multiple sclerosis or sarcoidosis. As such, intermediate uveitis may be the first expression of a systemic condition. Infectious causes of intermediate uveitis include Epstein-Barr virus infection, Lyme disease, HTLV-1 virus infection, cat scratch disease, and hepatitis C.|$|E
40|$|Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis</b> is {{characterized}} by a chronic, low-grade non-granulomatous anterior uveitis with widely scattered small keratic precipitates, a variable degree of atrophy and depigmentation of the iris, and no synechiae. It is usually unilateral, although bilateral involvement has been reported in up to 10 % of cases. Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis</b> occurs in approximately 5 % of all patients with uveitis and is regarded as a distinct nosological entity. The typical age of onset is in the third or fourth decade, and there is an equal incidence among men and women. Because not all characteristic clinical signs are present at the same time, the diagnosis of Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis</b> is often difficult to make, especially in the earlier stages of the disease. No minimal clinical diagnostic criteria, pathognomonic for this eye disease, have been internationally accepted yet, and no laboratory tests are available to confirm the diagnosis of Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis.</b> Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis</b> may even be considered as the most commonly misdiagnosed form of uveitis. Cataract and glaucoma are two major complications in Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis.</b> A subcapsular cataract develops in almost all cases, whereas glaucoma occurs in approximately 20 % of the cases. Cataract extractions with or without intraocular lens implantation currently have excellent results. Glaucoma is considered to be the most serious complication, because the therapy of glaucoma (medical and surgical), as reported in the literature, has a poor outcome. The origin of Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis</b> is still unknown and many hypotheses for the etiology of this eye disease have been proposed since Ernst Fuchs presented his theory in 1906. In chronological order, these theories are the following: Sympathetic Theory, Hereditary Theory, Association with Toxoplasmosis, Vascular Theory and Immunologic Theory. Until now. no definite proof has been obtained to accept or to reject any of these theories. AIM OF THE THESIS The aim of this thesis was to study the clinical aspects and etiology of Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis.</b> An update of the literature on Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis</b> is presented in chapter 2. Clinical Aspects Based on an analysis of clinical findings in 51 patients, clinical diagnostic criteria for Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis</b> are proposed in chapter 3. In chapter 4, the severity and prognosis{ of secondary glaucoma are evaluated, based on a larger series of patients with Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis</b> who needed medical and surgical intervention for glaucoma. Iris translucency, an important clinical feature, is quantified in patients with Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis</b> by a modification of the direct compensation technique for the measurement of intraocular stray light in chapter 5. Etiology Different approaches have been used to study the various etiological theories on Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis.</b> One case report and a short review of the literature to support the sympathetic theory and the association between Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis</b> and the Parry Romberg syndrome are presented in chapter 6. Two cases with Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis</b> and a definite (congenital) ocular toxoplasmosis (chapter 7 and 8), and clinical and laboratory examinations for ocular toxoplasmosis in a larger series of patients with Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis</b> (chapter 9) are reported to elucidate the association between Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis</b> and toxoplasmosis-like chorioretinal lesions. The alternative hypothesis for the chorioretinal lesions in Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis,</b> namely that of autoimmunity directed against retinal antigens, was evaluated in chapter 10. Chapter 11 describes the detection of circulating autoantibodies against the anterior segment (uvea, cornea) of the eye in patients with Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis.</b> In chapter 12 the hypothesis of an immune complex vasculitis of the iris vessels was assessed with an immunofluorescence technique on peripheral iridectomies of patients with Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Autoimmunity {{directed}} against retinal or choroidal antigens {{has been suggested}} {{to play a role}} in the chorioretinal lesions observed in patients with Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis.</b> This hypothesis was addressed and patients with Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis</b> were tested for cellular immunity (migration inhibitory factor assay) against human retinal S-antigen. A significantly higher percentage of patients with Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis</b> had a positive cellular autoimmune response to S-antigen than healthy controls and other patients with anterior uveitis. This finding is remarkable since Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis</b> is generally classified as an anterior uveitis and patients with Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis</b> without chorioretinal lesions also had a positive test. In view of these results and a sensitisation against a corneal antigen reported earlier in Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis,</b> it is suggested that a chronic low grade grade anterior uveitis or chorioretinitis of unknown origin may cause the release of potent autoantigens in these patients...|$|E

30|$|Anterior {{idiopathic}} uveitis and Fuchs’ <b>cyclitis</b> {{were associated}} with a higher risk for failure of surgery.

40|$|AIMS—To analyse {{the unusual}} {{physical}} sign of iris crystals occurring {{in patients with}} uveitis.  METHODS—Demographic details and clinical features were documented in 24  patients with chronic uveitis and iris crystals. Plasma immunoglobulin subclasses were measured, and a histopathological review of iridectomy specimens from 33  patients with chronic uveitis was also undertaken.  RESULTS—The mean age of patients was 38  years, with a slight preponderance of females. 17  patients had Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis</b> although {{a number of other}} uveitis entities were represented. There was no correlation between severity of clinical signs and presence of iris crystals. Over a mean follow up period of 15  months no significant change in the number, size, or position of the crystals was seen except in four patients who underwent intraocular surgery. Only three patients had raised plasma IgG 1. The review of the histology of iridectomy specimens failed to show evidence of Russell body formation in any patient.  CONCLUSIONS—Iris crystals appear to be rare but may be underreported as they are small and can easily be missed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Laser flare-cell {{photometry}} enables {{objective and}} quantitative measurement of anterior chamber inflammation. Systematic data currently are used mainly for clinical research; few are yet available in uveitis. The authors prospectively studied the amount, duration, and pattern of inflammation for well-defined uveitic conditions and evaluated the potential usefulness of laser flare-cell photometry in uveitis. METHODS: Mean initial flare was calculated in HLA-B 27 -positive acute anterior uveitis, acute herpes zoster uveitis, acute retinal necrosis (ARN), Fuchs heterochromic <b>cyclitis,</b> intermediate uveitis (pars planitis-type), posterior sarcoidosis, posterior pole toxoplasmosis, and birdshot chorioretinopathy. Evolution of aqueous flare and cells was analyzed for acute anterior uveitis, ARN, and pars planitis treated for cystoid macular edema (CME), {{all of which}} received a standardized therapy. RESULTS: Blood-aqueous barrier disruption was very pronounced in acute anterior uveitis (170. 2 +/- 33 photons/msecond), ARN (177. 4 +/- 88 photons/msecond), moderate in posterior sarcoidosis (38. 1 +/- 11 photons/msecond), acute zoster uveitis (25. 8 +/- 6. 1 photons/msecond), and pars planitis (19. 1 +/- 2. 9 photons/msecond) but only minimal in Fuchs heterochromic <b>cyclitis</b> (10. 2 +/- 3. 5 photons/msecond), toxoplasmosis (9. 0 +/- 1. 2 photons/msecond) and birdshot chorioretinopathy (5. 7 +/- 1. 1 photons/msecond). For acute anterior uveitis, ARN, and pars planitis with CME, the inflammatory patterns were determined. The potential of laser flare-cell photometry for precise follow-up and adjustment of therapy was illustrated in cases of anterior and posterior uveitis. CONCLUSION: The authors' findings show that laser flare-cell photometry allows quantitative assessment of inflammation in uveitis and contributes to improved management of patients with uveitis...|$|E

40|$|Ahmed M Bawazeer, 1, 2 Heba Ismail Joharjy 1 1 Uveitis Services, Department of Ophthalmology, King Abdulaziz University, 2 Magrabi Eye and Ear Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia Background: The {{association}} of {{human leukocyte antigen}} B 27 (HLA-B 27) with anterior uveitis is well known. The prevalence of HLA-B 27 {{and its relation to}} anterior uveitis is related to race and geographic location. The association is strongest in Western countries and weakest in Eastern countries. Data regarding this association from Middle Eastern countries are limited. Thus, we undertook the study reported here to evaluate the {{association of}} HLA-B 27 with anterior uveitis in patients in a tertiary center in the western region of the Saudi Arabia. Methods: The study involved a retrospective analysis of the records of patients with anterior uveitis, referred to the uveitis clinic in Magrabi Eye and Ear Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, from 1999 to 2010. The cost-effectiveness of HLA-B 27 testing was analyzed. Results: Among the 587 cases of uveitis, 335 (57. 1 %; mean age 37. 56 ± 12. 82 years; 203 male and 132 female) cases were of anterior uveitis. All patients with anterior uveitis were investigated for HLA-B 27 positivity. Idiopathic anterior uveitis was the most common (80 %), followed by Fuchs heterochromic <b>cyclitis</b> (7. 45 %) and ankylosing spondylitis (3. 8 %). Only two patients were HLA-B 27 positive. The cost-effectiveness of HLA-B 27 testing was found to be 165, 000 Saudi riyals (44, 594 US dollars) per positive case. Conclusion: HLA-B 27 -related uveitis appears to be very rare in our part of the world. Idiopathic uveitis is {{the most common type of}} anterior uveitis.

40|$|AIM—To {{investigate}} whether serum levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1  (sICAM- 1) {{can serve as}} a marker of the presence of systemic disease in intermediate uveitis.  METHODS—In a multicentre study sICAM- 1 serum levels were measured in 61  patients with idiopathic intermediate uveitis, controls included 56  uveitis patients with a systemic disease (26  sarcoid associated uveitis and 30  HLA-B 27 positive acute anterior uveitis), 58  uveitis patients without systemic disease (30  toxoplasma chorioretinitis and 28  Fuchs' hetrochromic <b>cyclitis),</b> and 21  normal controls. The clinical records of the patients with intermediate uveitis were analysed for disease characteristics at the time of blood sampling and for a relation with the development of a systemic disease after a mean follow up of 4. 5  years.  RESULTS—Increased serum levels of sICAM- 1 were found in 34  out of 61  patients with intermediate uveitis and were significantly different when compared with toxoplasmosis, Fuchs' <b>cyclitis,</b> and healthy controls (p< 0. 001). Elevated sICAM- 1 levels were also found in 18  out of 26  patients with sarcoid uveitis and in 11  out of 30  patients with HLA-B 27 associated anterior uveitis. Raised sICAM- 1 levels in the intermediate uveitis group were significantly associated with active ocular disease (p< 0. 01) and the presence of vitreous exudates (p< 0. 05). Increased levels of sICAM- 1 correlated with interleukin 8  levels (IL- 8) (tested in a previous study in the same group of intermediate uveitis patients) in patients with active systemic involvement. Follow up of the patients showed that an established or suspected systemic disease was found more often in the 21  intermediate uveitis patients with increased sICAM- 1 and IL- 8 levels compared with the other 40  patients with intermediate uveitis (p< 0. 01).  CONCLUSIONS—The measurement of both sICAM- 1 and IL- 8 {{can be used as a}} marker for ocular disease activity and for a predisposition of developing an associated systemic disease in intermediate uveitis patients. ...|$|E
30|$|The {{diagnostic}} algorithm was as follows: first, uveitis was diagnosed, categorized, and graded {{according to}} the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature Working Group criteria [[6]]. Specifically, uveitis was classified in terms of anatomic localization, namely: (a) anterior (iritis, iridocyclitis, and anterior cyclitis); (b) intermediate (pars planitis, posterior <b>cyclitis,</b> and hyalitis); (c) posterior (focal, multifocal, or diffuse choroiditis, chorioretinitis, retinochoroiditis, retinitis, and neuroretinitis); (d) panuveitis (inflammation of the anterior chamber, vitreous, and retina or choroid). In addition, uveitis was categorized as acute, chronic, or recurrent according to its course, whether it was unilateral or bilateral, or granulomatous or non-granulomatous. The four aspects of intraocular inflammation (anterior chamber cells, anterior chamber flare, vitreous cells, and vitreous haze or debris) were ranked using an ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4 + [[6]]. Second, patients were investigated for infectious etiologies, including tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, syphilis, borreliosis, rickettsial infections, toxocariasis, herpes zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and rubella.

Albumin levels, determined by radial immunodiffusion, were used as a measure of the disruption of the blood aqueous barrier. Results. Significantly lower mature TGF-/ 32 levels were detected in aqueous humor samples of patients with uveitis, compared to the two control groups without intraocular inflammation. Samples of patients with uveitis without detectable mature TGF-/ 32 did contain latent TGF-/ 32 levels (504 to 6024 pg/ml). In aqueous humor, there was a significant negative correlation between mature TGF-/ 32 and albumin levels. No mature TGF-/ 5 could be detected in vitreou...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{report the}} risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ocular {{infection}} after UVA-riboflavin corneal collagen cross-linking in a patient with atopic dermatitis. Methods. A 22 -year-old man, with bilateral evolutive keratoconus and atopic dermatitis, underwent UVA-riboflavin corneal cross-linking and presented with rapidly progressive corneal abscesses and <b>cyclitis</b> in the treated eye five days after surgery. The patient {{was admitted to the}} hospital and treated with broad-spectrum antimicrobic therapy. Results. The patient had positive cultures for MRSA, exhibiting a strong resistance to antibiotics. Antibiotic therapy was modified and targeted accordingly. The intravitreal reaction is extinguished, but severe damage of ocular structures was unavoidable. Conclusion. Riboflavin/UVA corneal cross-linking is considered a safe procedure and is extremely effective in halting keratoconus' progression. However, this procedure is not devoid of infectious complications, due to known risk factors and/or poor patients' hygiene compliance in the postoperative period. Atopic dermatitis is a common disease among patients with keratoconus and Staphylococcus aureus colonization is commonly found in patients with atopic dermatitis. Therefore, comorbidity with atopic dermatitis should be thoroughly assessed through clinical history before surgery. A clinical evaluation within three days after surgery and the imposition of strict personal hygiene rules are strongly recommended...|$|E
40|$|During {{the period}} from January 1990 to December 1993, 558 new {{patients}} (250 female and 308 male, mean age 44 years; range 5 - 92) were seen at the Uveitis Clinic of the Hopital Jules Gonin. These 558 patients (740 eyes) were subdivided into anterior uveitis (343 patients- 61 %), intermediate uveitis (57 patients- 10 %), posterior uveitis (118 patients- 21 %) and panuveitis (40 patients- 7 %). The incidence of uveitis for the referral area considered was calculated to be 17. 5 per 100, 000 inhabitants per year. A specific diagnosis was found in 386 cases (69 %). The most frequently diagnosed entities were HLA-B 27 -associated acute anterior uveitis (89 cases- 15. 9 %), uveitis associated with acute herpes zoster ophthalmicus (54 cases- 9. 7 %), toxoplasmosis (53 cases- 9. 5 %), sarcoidosis (33 cases- 5. 9 %), typical pars planitis (31 cases- 5. 6 %), Fuchs' heterochromic <b>cyclitis</b> (30 cases- 5. 4 %), herpetic anterior uveitis (23 cases- 4. 1 %) and acute retinal necrosis (13 cases- 2. 3 %). Incidence and distribution of most disease entities correspond {{to those of other}} European and American series...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2010. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Purpose Secondary glaucoma {{is a difficult}} and frequent complication of uveitis. The {{aim of this study}} is to describe the results of surgery in uveitic glaucoma and to identify situations linked to a high risk of failure of the surgery. Methods Retrospective observational study. Clinical and surgical data from 27 cases of uveitic glaucoma that underwent glaucoma surgery over a period of 9 years were collected. Results The main diagnosis and aetiology were anterior uveitis (61. 90 %) and herpes (38. 10 %) respectively. Trabeculectomy with mitomycin C was performed in 51. 9 % of the cases. An intraocular pressure lower than 16 mmHg and managed with less than two drugs was achieved in 48. 15 % of the cases. Higher risks of surgical failure were associated with intermediate uveitis, idiopathic uveitis, Fuchs ’ <b>cyclitis,</b> combined surgery with phacoemulsification, omission of mitomycin C, intraocular inflammation at surgery and relapse of the uveitis. Conclusions There are some situations linked to a high risk of failure of surgery in uveitic glaucoma, which should be avoided when possible, mainly the association of higher risk with combined approaches...|$|E
