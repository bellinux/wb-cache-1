5|$|After {{starting}} 28th, Kevin Harvick {{had advanced}} to the tenth position by lap 28. Two laps later, Greg Biffle said on his team radio that he <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> smoke in his race car, which his team responded that {{it was probably a}} tire rubbing against the car. During lap 34, Martin Truex, Jr. moved to seventh, having started 25th on the grid. Four laps later, Hamlin had moved to the 22nd position after his earlier accident. On the 41st lap, Truex, Jr. moved past Johnson to claim the fourth position, while Hamlin continued to move toward the front runners. Edwards had over a one-second lead over the second position by lap 46. On the following lap, Hamlin took over the 18th position. After 50 laps, only 38 cars remained on the same lap as the leader. Edwards continued to expand his lead from 1.33 to 1.6 seconds in only five laps. On lap 54, Edwards was the leader, ahead of Allmendinger, Kahne, Truex, and Johnson.|$|E

25|$|Berthelot {{was able}} to prepare this gas by passing vapours of organic {{compounds}} (methanol, ethanol, etc.) through a red-hot tube and collecting the effluent. He also found acetylene was formed by sparking electricity through mixed cyanogen and hydrogen gases. Berthelot later obtained acetylene directly by passing hydrogen between the poles of a carbon arc. Commercially available acetylene gas <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> foul due to the common impurities hydrogen sulfide and phosphine. However, as purity increases it becomes odourless.|$|E

500|$|In America Epstein {{had met the}} {{well-known}} divorce lawyer, Nat Weiss, whom Epstein later asked {{to take over the}} merchandising affairs of the Beatles and NEMS. Weiss would later state, [...] "The reality is that the Beatles never saw a penny out of the merchandising... Tens of millions of dollars went down the drain {{because of the way the}} whole thing was mishandled. Even after the judgement was vacated, you <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> the smoke from the ashes, that's how badly they had been burned." [...] Beatles' memorabilia, licensed by Seltaeb, is still sold at Beatles' conventions and on the internet.|$|E
500|$|Dylan {{made two}} {{important}} career moves in August 1962: he legally {{changed his name}} to Robert Dylan, and he signed a management contract with Albert Grossman. (In June 1961, Dylan had signed an agreement with Roy Silver. In 1962, Grossman paid Silver $10,000 to become sole manager.) Grossman remained Dylan's manager until 1970, and was notable for his sometimes confrontational personality and for protective loyalty. Dylan said, [...] "He was kind of like a Colonel Tom Parker figure... you <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> him coming." [...] Tensions between Grossman and John Hammond led to Hammond's being replaced as producer of Dylan's second album by the young African-American jazz producer, Tom Wilson.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Levine was {{mentioned}} {{in a hostile}} work environment lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by an unnamed security guard who claimed that Universal Music Publishing Group's Santa Monica location was [...] "infiltrated with pervasive drug use where you <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> marijuana seeping from various offices and openly used in common areas, and lounges". The guard claimed that when she complained about the cannabis smoke coming {{from one of the}} studios, she was told that [...] "it's Adam Levine ... if he wants to come to the lobby and do a line of cocaine on the floor, it's OK". In an official statement to The Hollywood Reporter, UMPG described the allegations as [...] "absurd".|$|E

500|$|Pilots {{nicknamed the}} Thunderjet [...] "The Lead Sled". It was also called [...] "The Iron Crowbar", [...] "a hole sucking air", [...] "The Hog" [...] ("The Groundhog"), and [...] "The World's Fastest Tricycle", [...] "Ground Loving Whore" [...] as a {{testament}} to its long takeoff rolls. F-84 lore stated that all aircraft were equipped with a [...] "sniffer" [...] device that, upon passing V2, would look for the dirt {{at the end of}} the runway. As soon as the device <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> the dirt, the controls would turn on and let the pilot fly off the ground. In the same vein, it was suggested a bag of dirt should be carried in the front landing gear well. Upon reaching V2, the pilot would dump the dirt under the wheels, fooling the sniffer device.|$|E
500|$|Weddle and Thompson {{also worked}} {{extensively}} {{on the scene in}} which Admiral Adama tries to provoke Col. Tigh into killing him. [...] Moore encouraged Weddle and Thompson to give the Adama character progressively crueler lines. The writers were the ones who inserted the line in the script in which Adama mentions Ellen Tigh's sexual infidelity. On the set, however, actor Edward James Olmos changed the line from Adama saying Ellen wanted a man with [...] "real blood in his veins" [...] to [...] "main vein," [...] then ad-libbed the line in which the character said, [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> her." [...] The scenes where Dualla finds the set of jacks and where Laura Roslin holds the plant cutting were added by director Michael Nankin. Weddle notes that although Nankin usually peppers his writers with script notes, he did not do so for this script.|$|E
500|$|John Brousseau {{commented that}} when he visited the Hole occasionally, [...] "you <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> that people live here, people sleep here." [...] He saw the {{executives}} being marched elsewhere on the base to take showers; his impression was that [...] "they {{looked like they were}} being marched to the gallowsâ€“ they just looked lifeless, with no purpose. Very hang-dog, droopy shoulders, slouchy, very sad, inward-looking creatures." [...] He said that they were only allowed out [...] "at certain times of day that would be adjudicated to be the least likely time when DM [...] would run into them if he was on the property. They would march out to Old Gilman House to take a shower and come back because they had no shower facilities inside the Hole. Later that got upgraded to let them go down to the garage." [...] Sometimes executives were allowed out for a short time to attend Church events, but many ended up spending months or even years in the Hole.|$|E

500|$|Lennon {{adapted the}} lyric for [...] "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!" [...] from an 1843 poster for Pablo Fanque's circus that he {{purchased}} at an antique shop in Kent {{on the day}} of filming the promotional film for [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever". Womack views the track as an effective blending of a print source and music: [...] "The interpretive power of the mixed-media application accrues its meaning through the musical production with which the group imbues the Ur-text of the poster." [...] MacDonald notes Lennon's request for a [...] "fairground production wherein one <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> the sawdust", an atmosphere that Martin and Emerick attempted to create with a sound collage that comprised randomly assembled recordings of harmoniums, harmonicas and calliopes. MacDonald describes the song as [...] "a spontaneous expression of its author's playful hedonism". Everett thinks that the track's use of Edwardian imagery thematically links it with the album's opening number.|$|E
500|$|Coveney {{describes}} [...] "Aaroma", {{the fourth}} track, as offering a [...] "sexy challenge" [...] to the listener. Pru adapted {{one of the}} song's lyrics, [...] "If a man came my way and I didn't doubt him", {{from one of her}} poems. While discussing the meaning of the title, the singer said it derived from an [...] "old southern saying: 'I <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> you coming'". [...] "Hazy Shade" [...] is a ballad that Hogan described as [...] "recall 'blue light in the basement' old skool slow jams". Preceded by [...] "Salsa Interlude", Pru's cover of Sade's 1984 single [...] "Smooth Operator" [...] features a stronger Latin-inspired instrumental than the original. Hogan noted that the song included [...] "popping percussion and fluttery flute runs". The ending of the ninth track, [...] "Can't Compare Your Love", takes inspiration from spoken word performances, and the following song ,"Sketches of Pain", deliberately plays with the title of Miles Davis' 1960 album Sketches of Spain. Colin Ross of PopMatters described the twelfth track, [...] "What They Gone Do?", as featuring a [...] "brassy two-step" [...] in its instrumentation.|$|E
500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1936, {{the crew of the}} Insect class gunboat HMS Gnat voted to get a ship's mascot. This was {{due in part to the}} {{competitive}} nature of the gunboats, with HMS Bee, Cicada, and Cricket already having mascots of their own. The Captain and the Chief Bosun's mate, Lt. Cmdr. J. Waldergrave and Chief Petty Officer Charles Jefferey, purchased Judy from the kennel and presented her to the crew. As her mother was known as Kelly of Sussex, Judy was listed as Judy of Sussex in her Royal Navy paperwork. It was hoped to train her as a gundog, but the men began to treat her like a pet instead, and several days after her arrival, Jefferey's log stated that [...] "our chances of making her a trained gundog are very small." [...] Her time spent on the streets of Shanghai was blamed for her lack of hunting instinct, the only time that she would point in the traditional manner was when she <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> food.|$|E
5000|$|Richard Wagamese in {{his review}} criticised Bergen for {{presenting}} [...] "little of the racial tension that <b>could</b> be <b>smelled</b> {{in the air like}} cordite".

50|$|Most of {{the smoke}} in eastern North America was borne aloft by climatic {{conditions}} to high altitudes.

Explanations included nuclear armageddon, local fires, supernatural forces, a solar eclipse and alien invasion.|$|R
5000|$|A Nabisco factory on Artesia Boulevard {{was known}} for many years as a Buena Park landmark. The red [...] "Nabisco" [...] sign was visible from the I-5 Freeway, and {{visitors}} to the town <b>could</b> often <b>smell</b> cookies. The factory produced Honey Maid graham crackers, Ritz Crackers, and Nilla Wafers, among other Nabisco products, before shutting down in 2006.|$|R
500|$|In 1867, a jar {{was found}} in a Paris {{pharmacy}} with the inscription [...] "Remains found under the stake of Joan of Arc, virgin of Orleans." [...] They consisted of a charred human rib, carbonized wood, a piece of linen and a cat femurâ€”explained as the practice of throwing black cats onto the pyre of witches. They are now in the Museum of Art and History in Chinon. In 2006, , a forensic scientist at [...] (Garches) was authorized to study the relics. Carbon-14 tests and various spectroscopic analyses were performed, and the results determined that the remains come from an Egyptian mummy from the sixth to the third century BC. The charred appearance {{was the result of the}} embalming substances, not from combustion. Large amounts of pine pollen were also found, consistent with the presence of resin used in mummification and some unburned linen was found and was determined to be similar to that used to wrap mummies. The noted perfumers Guerlain and Jean Patou said that they <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> vanilla in the remains, also consistent with mummification. Apparently the mummy was part of the ingredients of medieval pharmacopoeia and it was relabeled in a time of French nationalism.|$|E
500|$|Humphrey won the party's {{nomination}} on {{the first}} ballot after a two-hour debate among delegates the next day, defeating McCarthy 1759.25 to 601. McGovern finished in third with 146.5, and gave a lukewarm endorsement of Humphrey, asking him to be [...] "his own man". McCarthy refused to make an endorsement, although he privately confided to Humphrey that his supporters would not understand if he immediately showed his support. Humphrey also narrowly won the party plank {{in support of the}} Vietnam War, although his officials pleaded with Johnson to accept a compromise with the doves, which he refused. The results caused the protests to intensify, prompting the use of tear gas, which Humphrey <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> in his hotel room. He also received six death threats. The tactics used to quell the protests were criticized by certain Democrats as being excessive. During his acceptance speech, Humphrey tried to unify the party, stating [...] "the policies of tomorrow need not be limited to the policies of yesterday." [...] He asked former Republican candidate Nelson Rockefeller to be his running mate, but he declined. Several other names were mentioned to Humphrey during the convention. Texas Governor John Connally was suggested by a delegation of southern Democratic governors, but the Governor himself suggested Vietnam ambassador Cyrus Vance. O'Brien and Fred Harris appeared to suggest themselves for the position, and adviser Connell also suggested Harris, although Max Kampelman favored former Peace Corps director Sargent Shriver. Humphrey instead decided on Senator and former Governor Edmund Muskie of Maine, who had been his preferred choice. Observers noted the selection of the Senator, active in civil rights and labor and on neither side of the war issue, was a move to appeal to liberals while not upsetting establishment Democrats. Republican nominee Richard Nixon congratulated Humphrey on his victory as the general election campaign began.|$|E
