Second, a number of baryogenesis models are discussed, including which GUT Baryo-genesis and Leptogenesis. Third, we discuss Coherent Baryogenesis. Starting from the Wigner transform we construct four current equations, one {{of which can be}} identified with a charge current. We use Green’s functions method to solve for the current equations. We express the Green’s functions for the currents in terms of the mode functions. Next, we assume a small mass parameter and solve for the currents iteratively. At second order solutions were found for each helicity sector. When the total charge was computed, however, these <b>contributions</b> <b>cancelled</b> each other.

We also calculate the mass corrections, showing the supersymmetry is preserved. As the matter fields decouple from the gauge field in the pure Chern-Simons limit, this work sheds somelight on the regularization dependency of the correction in pure Chern-Simons systems. We also discuss the implication to the case when the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken by the Higgs mechanism. 2 There has been recently some interest in the regularization dependency of the quantum correction to the Chern-Simons coefficient.

The different contributions from gluino, neutralino and chargino diagrams are examined in detail, concluding that it is not justified to neglect electroweak gaugino diagrams if the squark mass matrices contain flavor non-diagonal LL elements. We find that the {{constraints on the}} mass-splitting are very strong for light gluino masses. However, if the gluino is heavier than the squarks the constraints on the mass-splitting are much weaker. There are even large regions in parameter space where the different NP <b>contributions</b> <b>cancel</b> each other, leaving the mass-splitting nearly unconstrained.

50|$|The {{main idea}} behind the little Higgs models is that the one-loop {{contribution}} to the tachyonic Higgs boson mass coming from the top quark cancels (the other one-loop contributions are small enough that they don't really matter; the top Yukawa coupling is huge (because related to its mass) {{and all the other}} Yukawa couplings and gauge couplings are small). The reason is that, simplifying, a loop is proportional to the coupling constant (following the example above) of one of the SU(2) groups. Because of the symmetries of the theory the <b>contributions</b> <b>cancel</b> until you have a two-loop contribution involving both groups. This protects the Higgs boson mass for about one order of magnitude, which is good enough to evade many of the precision electroweak constraints.|$|R

The main results show that the behavior of the SPDE is well approximated by a stochastic ordinary differential equation describing the amplitude of the dominant mode. The cubic and the quadratic nonlinearities lead to cubic nonlinearities of opposite sign. Here we study the interesting case, where both <b>contributions</b> <b>cancel</b> and in the right scaling a quintic nonlinearity emerges in the amplitude equation.

40|$|Abstract. We {{discuss the}} problem of the {{spectral}} function of vacuum energy.

Examples of the spectral function of the vacuum energy in the condensed-matter systems with relativity emerging at low energy are presented.
