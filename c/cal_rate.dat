40|$|Chemical rate {{constants}} {{determine the}} composi- tion {{of the atmosphere}} and how this composition has changed over time. They are central {{to our understanding of}} climate change and air quality degradation. Atmospheric chemistry models, whether online or offline, box, regional or global, use these rate constants. Expert panels evaluate laboratory mea- surements, making recommendations for the rate constants that should be used. This results in very similar or identi- <b>cal</b> <b>rate</b> constants being used by all models. The inherent un- certainties in these recommendations are, in general, there- fore ignored. We explore the impact of these uncertainties on the composition of the troposphere using the GEOS-Chem chemistry transport model. Based on the Jet Propulsion Lab- oratory (JPL) and International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) evaluations we assess the influence of 50 mainly inorganic rate constants and 10 photolysis rates on tropospheric composition through the use of the GEOS- Chem chemistry transport model. We assess the impact on four standard metrics: an- nual mean tropospheric ozone burden, surface ozone and tropospheric OH concentrations, and tropospheric methane lifetime. Uncertainty in the rate constants for M NO 2 +OH−→HNO 3 and O 3 +NO→NO 2 +O 2 are the two largest sources of uncertainty in these metrics. The ab- solute magnitude of the change in the metrics is similar if rate constants are increased or decreased by their σ values. We investigate two methods of assessing these uncertainties, addition in quadrature and a Monte Carlo approach, and con- clude they give similar outcomes. Combining the uncertain- ties across the 60 reactions gives overall uncertainties on the annual mean tropospheric ozone burden, surface ozone and tropospheric OH concentrations, and tropospheric methane lifetime of 10, 11, 16 and 16 %, respectively. These are larger than the spread between models in recent model intercompar- isons. Remote regions such as the tropics, poles and upper troposphere are most uncertain. This chemical uncertainty is sufficiently large to suggest that rate constant uncertainty should be considered alongside other processes when model results disagree with measurement. Calculations for the pre-industrial simulation allow a tropospheric ozone radiative forcing to be calculated of 0. 412 ± 0. 062 W m− 2. This uncertainty (13 %) is compara- ble to the inter-model spread in ozone radiative forcing found in previous model–model intercomparison studies where the rate constants used in the models are all identical or very similar. Thus, the uncertainty of tropospheric ozone radia- tive forcing should expanded to include this additional source of uncertainty. These rate constant uncertainties are signifi- cant and suggest that refinement of supposedly well-known chemical rate constants should be considered alongside other improvements to enhance our understanding of atmospheric processes...|$|E

The boatwhistle is produced only by males on nests (Gray and Winn 1961) and is endogenously driven {{as well as}} influenced by calling of surrounding males (Winn 1964, 1967, 1972; Fish 1972).

40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} {{maintain}} group cohesion, many social mammals and birds regularly produce close calls. In some primate species, close calls {{appear to have a}} dual function: calls addressed at a broad class of targets serve to maintain group cohesion, whereas the same calls directed at a specific target serve to regulate subsequent social interactions. Red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) produce different types of close calls: grunts, long grunts, hoos and meows. In order to study the function of these calls, we conducted focal obser-vations and vocal recordings from eight adult males and females out of four social groups in Kirindy Forest, Western Madagascar. Redfronted lemurs produce long grunts, hoos and meows at relatively low rates during foraging, resting or group movements, respectively. Grunts were given most often and more or less constantly during foraging and trav-eling. <b>Calling</b> <b>rate</b> increased when the risk of separation increased and may thus promote group cohesion. Grunts given during approaches of other group members resulted more often in friendly interactions than approaches that were not accompanied by a grunt. Thus, redfronted lemurs produce specific but also generic contact calls, whereas the latter calls have a dual function that varies depending on the addressed audience: they act as an auditory beacon to maintain group cohesion and serve as signals of benign intent to avoid costly conflicts and facilitating social interactions...|$|R

40|$|In {{proximity}} to seismic operations, bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) decrease their calling rates. Here, we investigate {{the transition from}} normal calling behavior to decreased calling and identify two threshold levels of received sound from airgun pulses at which calling behavior changes. Data were collected in August-October 2007 - 2010, during the westward autumn migration in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea. Up to 40 directional acoustic recorders (DASARs) were deployed at five sites offshore of the Alaskan North Slope. Using triangulation, whale calls localized within 2 km of each DASAR were identified and tallied every 10 minutes each season, so that the detected call rate {{could be interpreted as}} the actual call production rate. Moreover, airgun pulses were identified on each DASAR, analyzed, and a cumulative sound exposure level was computed for each 10 -min period each season (CSEL 10 -min). A Poisson regression model was used {{to examine the relationship between}} the received CSEL 10 -min from airguns and the number of detected bowhead calls. <b>Calling</b> <b>rates</b> increased as soon as airgun pulses were detectable, compared to calling rates in the absence of airgun pulses. After the initial increase, calling rates leveled off at a received CSEL 10 -min of ~ 94 dB re 1 μPa 2 -s (the lower threshold). In contrast, once CSEL 10 -min exceeded ~ 127 dB re 1 μPa 2 -s (the upper threshold), whale calling rates began decreasing, and when CSEL 10 -min values were above ~ 160 dB re 1 μPa 2 -s, the whales were virtually silent...|$|R
40|$|The {{relation}} between acoustic signaling and reproductive success {{is important to}} understand the evolution of vocal communication systems and has been well studied in several taxa but never clearly shown in fish. This study aims to investigate whether vocal behavior affects the reproductive success in the Lusitanian toadfish (Halobatrachus didactylus) that relies on acoustic communication to attract mates. We recorded 56 nest-holding (type I) males during the breeding season and analyzed the calling performance and acoustic features of the mate advertising sounds (boatwhistles) exhibited over circa 2 weeks. Hormonal levels of the subjects and the number of eggs (reproductive success) present in the respective nests were quantified. Nesting males attracted both females and other males, namely smaller type I males with significantly lower total length (TL), body condition, sonic muscle mass, gonad mass, and accessory glands mass. <b>Calling</b> <b>rate</b> (CR), calling effort (CE) (% time spent calling), and sound dominant frequency were significantly higher in nesting males with clutches than in those without clutches. Sex steroids (11 -ketotestosterone and testosterone) were not correlated with vocal parameters or number of eggs. Maximum CR and CE were the best predictors of the number of eggs. In addition, these vocal variables were best explained by male’s TL, condition, and sonic muscle mass. We provide first evidence that vocal behavior significantly determines reproductive success in a vocal fish and show that acoustic signaling at higher and constant rates can operate as an indicator of the male’s size and body condition and probably of elevated motivation for reproduction...|$|R

We compared males calling in summer and winter, and found that males of H. prasinus exhibit seasonal adjustments in metabolic and morphometric variables. Individuals calling during winter were larger and showed higher resting metabolic rates than those calling during summer. <b>Calling</b> <b>rates</b> were not affected by season. Winter animals showed lower liver and heart activity level of citrate synthase (CS), partially compensated by larger liver mass. Winter individuals also showed higher activity of pyruvate kinase (PK) and lower activity of CS in trunk muscles, and higher activity of CS in leg muscles. Winter metabolic adjustments seem to be achieved by both compensatory mechanisms to the lower environmental temperature and a seasonally oriented aerobic depression of several organs. the impact of seasonal metabolic changes on calling performance and the capacity of subtropical anurans for metabolic thermal acclimatization are also discussed.

40|$|OBJECTIVES Computers {{are a part}} of {{everyday}} life and offer an exciting way of learning. The aim of our {{study was to determine the}} effectiveness of teaching undergraduate endocrinology using a Computer Assisted Learning (CAL) programme. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS One hundred and eighty-five first year clinical medical students were randomly assigned either to attend a series of conventional lectures (n = 77) or to have the same material available through a CAL programme. MEASUREMENTS A multiple choice question examination was performed before and after the course. Lecture attendance and individual usage of the computer system were recorded. Students were asked to fill in an evaluation form at the end of the study. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the first examination scores between the groups. Both groups improved their scores after the course. Students spent longer performing CAL than attending lectures. Those who scored lowest in the first examination spent the most time on the CAL course. Those who spent the most time on the CAL course showed the largest improvement in examination score.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Diagnosis of Kawasaki disease (KD) {{is based}} on 5 {{clinical}} features. Incomplete KD (IKD), which has fewer features, {{is more common in}} infants and older children, in whom the rate of coronary artery aneurysms is paradoxically higher. We conducted this study to evaluate risk factors associated with age-at-diagnosis on coronary arterial lesions (CAL) in patients with IKD. Subjects and Methods: Retrospective data from 396 patients with KD in a single center were collected from January 2003 to July 2007. Patients were grouped according to their age at diagnosis; Group A (< 1 year of age), Group B (1 ≤age< 5 years of age), and Group C (≥ 5 years of age). Results: Among a total of 396 patients with KD, 87 (22. 0 %) were in Group A, 246 (62. 1 %) in Group B, and 63 (15. 9 %) in Group C. In groups A and C, lag times for starting intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) were longer than in Group B. There were no differences in the incidence of IKD, late <b>CAL,</b> or <b>rates</b> of IVIG retreatment among the three groups. Among 174 patients with IKD, there were no age-related differences in late CAL incidence or IVIG retreatment. Compared with typical KD, duration of fever and lag times to start IVIG were longer, and the rate of IVIG retreatment was higher in IKD, but {{there was no difference in}} the risk of CAL between typical KD and IKD. Conclusion: In the management of KD, especially the incomplete type, age-associated factors appear not to be significant for predicting the development of CAL.

Optical mi- croscopy observations {{as well as}} small angle light scattering (SALS) experiments were performed using a parallel plate geometry. In agreement with previous work, aligned strings of particles were observed when shearing faster then a criti- <b>cal</b> shear <b>rate,</b> which {{was found to be}} independent of particle size. In contrast to earlier work, however, the role of parti- cle migration was found to be of prime importance. Particles were shown to migrate towards the plates where the particles assembled and aligned in strings running in the flow direc- tion. For the smallest particles (1 µ m diameter), the align- ment of particle doublets or short strings along the vorticity direction was observed at low shear rates, which flipped to a an orientation into the flow direction of longer strings at higher shear rates. This phenomenon never detected before for spherical particles and maybe attributed to an interplay between the hydrodynamic and the attractive inter-particle forces. Finally,SALS experiments were used to quantify the degree of alignment and its dependence o particle size, shear rate and gap. For the system under investigation, the degree of alignment was found to increase with increasing shear rate and particle size and with decreasing gap. The present results suggest that, depending on the details of the suspend- ing medium and the size and nature of the suspending media, the formation of aligned structures is affected by the relative magnitude of the colloidal and hydrodynamic forces and the kinetics of string formation versus the kinetics of migratio...|$|R

Macrofossil assemblages have been grouped into five regional phases and are interpreted largely in terms of the response of the vegetation to changes in sea level, climate and management. Phase 1 represents pre-Roman fen woodland communities (> 2000 cal. BP); phase 2 represents salt-marsh communities formed during an estuarine phase in Romano-British times (c. 2000 – 1600 cal. BP); phase 3 represents ‘tussock-fen’ and carr communities suggestive of drier conditions in the post-Roman to early Medieval period (c. 1600 – 800 cal.

The biostratigraphic development of the Ant Valley floodplain mires has analogues in climatically induced humification changes of some British ombrotrophic mires, suggesting a response to similar climatic controls. Widespread human interference and control of the fen vegetation may be a relatively recent phenomenon (beginning possibly, 400 <b>cal.</b> BP).

These differences may play a causal role in electrophysiological changes observed in human heart failure and atrial fibrillation, such as action potential (AP) prolongation, increased AP triangulation, decreased intracellular calcium transient (CaT) magnitude and decreased CaT triangulation. Our goal is to investigate whether {{the information contained in}} mRNA measurements can be used to predict cardiac electrophysiological remodeling in heart failure using computational modeling. Using mRNA data recently obtained from failing and non-failing human hearts, we construct failing and non-failing cell populations incorporating natural variability and up/down regulation of channel conductivities. Six biomarkers are calculated for each cell in each population, at cycle lengths between 1500 ms and 300 ms. Regression analysis is performed to determine which ion channels drive biomarker variability in failing versus non-failing cardiomyocytes. Our models suggest that reported mRNA expression changes are consistent with AP prolongation, increased AP triangulation, increased CaT duration, decreased CaT triangulation and amplitude, and increased delay between AP and CaT upstrokes in the failing population. Regression analysis reveals that changes in AP biomarkers are driven primarily by reduction in I Kr, and changes in CaT biomarkers are driven predominantly by reduction in I CaL and SERCA. In particular, the role of I <b>CaL</b> is pacing <b>rate</b> dependent.

40|$|Amount {{of calling}} {{activity}} (calling effort) {{is a strong}} determinant of male mating success in species such as orthopterans and anurans that use acoustic communication {{in the context of}} mating behaviour. While many studies in crickets have investigated the determinants of calling effort, patterns of variability in male calling effort in natural choruses remain largely unexplored. Within-individual variability in calling activity across multiple nights of calling can influence female mate search and mate choice strategies. Moreover, calling site fidelity across multiple nights of calling can also affect the female mate sampling strategy. We therefore investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of acoustic signaling behaviour in a wild population of the field cricket species Plebeiogryllus guttiventris. We first studied the consistency of calling activity by quantifying variation in male calling effort across multiple nights of calling using repeatability analysis. Callers were inconsistent in their calling effort across nights and did not optimize nightly calling effort to increase their total number of nights spent calling. We also estimated calling site fidelity of males across multiple nights by quantifying movement of callers. Callers frequently changed their calling sites across calling nights with substantial displacement but without any significant directionality. Finally, we investigated trade-offs between within-night calling effort and energetically expensive calling song features such as call intensity and chirp <b>rate.</b> <b>Calling</b> effort was not correlated with any of the calling song features, suggesting that energetically expensive song features do not constrain male calling effort.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of the mixture preparation and combustion characteristics of a direct injection gasoline (G-DI) engine operating in both spark ignition (SI) and controlled-auto ignition with spark assistance (SA-CAl) is presented. The air motion, fuel distribution and combustion performance in the engine are described by the application of advanced Laser-based experimental methods and high-speed data acquisition. Determining the correct operation of the engine for spark ignition and compression ignition formed {{an important part of}} the research study. The series of experimental studies were conducted on a Ricardo Hydra singlecylinder research engine modified for optical access through the top 20 mm section of the cylinder bore, as well as via a 45 Ã‚Â° mirror and flat window inserted in the crown of the Bowditch piston arrangement. The cylinder head used was based on the Ricardo Flagship concept engine with reverse tumble geometry. Two different interchangeable camshaft sets permitted both high and low valve lift configurations to be utilised. Spark ignition (SI) and controlled-auto ignition with spark assistance (SA-CAl) were achieved in the test programme. Laser-induced fluorescence (L 1 F), combined with simultaneous flame imaging and Particle Image Velocity (PIV) enabled qualitative in-cylinder fuel concentration measurement during fired operation and quantitative motored air motion characteristics to be determined. Simultaneous acquisition of pressure-based data during the fired studies provided a record of the in-cylinder, intake and exhaust manifold pressures. The addition of K-type thermocouples provided additional temperature information in the engine. The results attained using the above techniques showed that rates of heat release in the SA-CAl combustion mode were considerably slower than those observed in a parallel SI combustion study. This suggested that a key indicator of controlled-auto ignition (CAl) was not present in this study; it is widely considered that <b>CAl</b> heat release <b>rates</b> are of the order of those encountered in SI, when considering 4 stroke operation. This result implied that flame-front propagation was the governing mechanism of fuel oxidisation in the SA-CAl mode. However, the results of the PIV studies in the SA-CAl mode suggested that the turbulence intensity was too low to support flame-front propagation in spark-initiated combustion. High-speed photography (HSP) applied in addition to the previously mentioned techniques showed that a hybrid mode of combustion exists in the SA-CAl reaction where flame front propagation could be seen to develop alongside individual sites of autoignition within the cylinder, albeit at a considerably lower rate. Images of fuel distribution in the combustion chamber acquired from the previous studies were correlated to pressure-based combustion stability data. A statistical analysis was conducted of both the SI and SA-CAl sets of data in order to determine cyclic variability within the in-cylinder fuel concentration. The results indicated higher than expected cycle-to-cycle and in-cycle variations in fuel distribution for an early injection, homogeneous charge, combustion mode when compared to those based upon the coefficient of variation in the measured indicated mean effective pressure. The L 1 F data. from the SA-CAl studies was found to be of far lower intensity, suggesting that the presence of high levels of exhaust residuals acted to attenuate the fluorescence signal. These findings were of particular importance to the application of the L 1 F technique in this manner. From the findings of the experimental techniques applied it was possible to determine from the mode of combustion encountered, SA-CAl, that a hybrid mode of fuel oxidation was occurring. It was clear that flame-front propagation was taking place, albeit at a far slower rate than in the corresponding Sl mode, as both high EGR rates and lower turbulence intensity was found to attenuate flame propagation, with further heat release occurring through diffusion burning and numerous autoignition points throughout the cylinder through the thermal energy supplied from the resident internal EGR.

40|$|Acoustic {{communication}} in orthopterans and anurans provides a suitable model system {{for studying the}} evolutionary mechanisms of sexual selection mainly because males use acoustic signals to attract females over long distances for pair formation. Females use these signals not only to localize conspecific males but also to discriminate between potential mates. Investigations {{on the effect of}} sexual selection on acoustic signals requires an understanding of how female preferences for different features of the acoustic signal affect male mating success under ecological constraints in wild populations. The effect of female preferences on male mating success depends on the mate sampling strategy that females employ to search for potential mates. Despite its relevance, female mate sampling strategies based on male acoustic signals have rarely investigated in orthopterans and anurans, especially in the field. Considering the elaborate knowledge of the role of sensory physiology in female phonotaxis behaviour and characterization of the male acoustic signal, I used the field cricket species Plebeiogryllus guttiventris as a model system in this study. In this thesis, I first investigated the ecology of callers in wild populations. I then investigated female mate sampling strategies by incorporating relevant information on the ecology of signalers and the sensory physiology of receivers. Amount of calling activity is a strong determinant of male mating success in acoustically communicating species such as orthopterans and anurans. While many studies in crickets have investigated the determinants of calling effort, patterns of variability in male calling effort in natural choruses remain largely unexplored. I therefore investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of acoustic chorusing behaviour in a wild population. I first studied the consistency of calling activity by quantifying variation in male calling effort across multiple nights of calling using repeatability analysis. Callers were inconsistent in their calling effort across nights and did not optimize nightly calling effort to increase their total number of nights spent calling. Next, I investigated calling site fidelity of males across multiple nights by quantifying movement of callers. Callers frequently changed their calling site across calling nights with substantial displacement but without any significant directionality. Finally, I investigated trade-offs between within-night calling effort and energetically expensive calling song features such as call intensity and chirp <b>rate.</b> <b>Calling</b> effort was not correlated with any of the calling song features, suggesting that energetically expensive song features do not constrain male calling effort. The two key features of signaling behaviour, calling effort and call intensity, which determine the duration and spatial coverage of the sexual signal, are uncorrelated and function independently Acoustic signal variation and female preference for different signal components constitute the prerequisite framework to study the mechanisms of sexual selection that shape acoustic communication. Despite several studies of acoustic {{communication in}} crickets, information on both male calling song variation in the field and female preference in the same system is lacking for most species. First, I quantified variation in the spectral, temporal and amplitudinal characteristics of the male calling song in a wild population, at two temporal scales, within and across nights, using repeatability analysis. Carrier frequency (CF) was the most repeatable call trait across nights, whereas chirp period (CP) had low repeatability. I further investigated female preferences based on song features with high and low repeatability (CF and CP respectively). Females showed no consistent preferences for CF but were more attracted towards calls with higher rates (shorter CP). I also examined the effect of signal intensity, which is known to {{play a critical role in}} female phonotaxis behaviour, on female preferences for faster calls. Females preferred louder calls over faster ones, implying a dominant role for signal intensity in female evaluation of potential mates based on acoustic signals. Call intensity was also the only signal feature that was positively correlated with male size. In the final chapter, I investigated female mate sampling strategies based on acoustic signals using both theoretical and empirical approaches. Analytical models of mate sampling have demonstrated significant differences in individual fitness returns for different sampling strategies. However these models have rarely incorporated relevant information on the ecology of signalers and the sensory physiology of receivers. I used simulation models to compare the costs and benefits of different mate sampling strategies by incorporating information on relative spacing of callers in natural choruses and the effect of signal intensity on female phonotaxis behaviour. The strategy of mating with males that were louder at the female position emerged as the optimal sampling rule in the simulations. When tested empirically in the field using callers in natural choruses, females seemed to follow the optimal strategy of mating with males that were perceived as louder at their position...|$|R
