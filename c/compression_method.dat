In practice {{a combination of}} compression is usually used instead of standalone <b>compression</b> <b>methods.</b> The software tool can be evolved, where we can easily combine existing <b>compression</b> <b>methods</b> to new one and test it consequently.

25|$|In {{order to}} avoid adverse {{side-effects}} from the possible presence of surfactants, an alternative casting process can be used involving a frit <b>compression</b> <b>method</b> that did not {{require the use of}} surfactants or surface modification. The dimensions can be controlled through the size of the syringe housing and through the mass of carbon nanotubes added. Their thicknesses are typically much larger than surfactant-cast buckypaper and have been synthesized from 120 μm up to 650 μm; whilst no nomenclature system exists to govern thicknesses for samples to be classified as paper, samples with thicknesses greater than 500 μm are referred to as buckydiscs. The frit <b>compression</b> <b>method</b> allows rapid casting of buckypaper and buckydiscs with recovery of the casting solvent and control over the 2D and 3D geometry.|$|E

25|$|As {{the typical}} use of JPEG is a lossy <b>compression</b> <b>method,</b> which {{somewhat}} reduces the image fidelity, {{it should not}} be used in scenarios where the exact reproduction of the data is required (such as some scientific and medical imaging applications and certain technical image processing work).|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the options}} in the JPEG {{standard}} are not commonly used, and as mentioned above, most image software uses the simpler JFIF format when creating a JPEG file, which among other things specifies the encoding method.

To confirm or allow resumed handshakes the server may send a session ID. The chosen protocol version should be the highest that both the client and server support. For example, if the client supports TLS version 1.1 and the server supports version 1.2, version 1.1 should be selected; version 1.2 should not be selected.|$|E
25|$|Argon is {{used for}} {{experiments}} involving laser heating because it is chemically insulating. Since it condenses at a temperature above that of liquid nitrogen, it can be loaded cryogenically. Helium and neon have low X-ray scattering factors and are thus used for collecting X-ray diffraction data. Helium and neon also have low shear moduli; minimizing strain on the sample. These two noble gases do not condense above that of liquid nitrogen and cannot be loaded cryogenically. Instead, a high-pressure gas loading system has been developed that employs a gas <b>compression</b> <b>method.</b>|$|E

500|$|Iwata {{became the}} company's {{coordinator}} of software production in 1983, the {{time during which}} he helped HAL create a relationship with Nintendo so {{they would be able}} to produce games for its newly released Nintendo Entertainment System. He traveled to Kyoto himself to request permission to work on games for the NES, to which Nintendo obliged. His first commercially published game was Joust for the NES—a port of the 1982arcade game. Other video games he worked on were Balloon Fight, NES Open Tournament Golf, EarthBound, and the Kirby games. Nintendo initially contacted several other developers to produce Open Tournament Golf; however, all of them declined as they did not believe the large amount of data could be stored within an NES cartridge. Iwata seized this opportunity and [...] "recklessly" [...] stepped up to develop the game. It proved particularly taxing as Iwata had to create his own data <b>compression</b> <b>method</b> in order to fit all 18courses into the game. Similarly, HAL had to program parallax scrolling for F-1 Race as the NES hardware did not initially support it.|$|E
500|$|In 1988, {{development}} of a new NES Zelda began, but one year later, the project was brought to Nintendo's next console; the Super Famicom in Japan, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in other regions. Due to the success of previous titles in the series, Nintendo was able to invest a large budget and ample development time and resources into the game's production. At the time, most SNES game cartridges had 4Mbit (512 KB) of storage space. This game broke the trend by using 8Mbit (1MB), allowing the Nintendo development team to create a remarkably expansive world for Link to inhabit. Like Super Mario World, this game used a simple graphic <b>compression</b> <b>method</b> on the SNES by limiting the color depth of many tiles to eight colors instead of the SNES's native 16-color tiles. The tiles were decompressed at runtime by adding a leading bit to each pixel's color index. Storage space was also saved by eliminating duplication: The Light World and the Dark World are almost identical in layout (though using differing texture tiles), and the Dark World exists in the game's ROM only as an [...] "overlay" [...] of the Light World.|$|E

40|$|Syllable-based {{compression}} achieves sufficient {{results on}} small or middle-sized text documents. Since {{the majority of}} XML documents are that size, we suppose that the syllable-based method can give good results on XML documents, especially on documents that have a simple structure (small amount of elements and attributes) and relatively long character data content. In this paper we propose two syllable-based <b>compression</b> <b>methods</b> for XML documents. The first method, XMLSyl, replaces XML tokens (element tags and attributes) by special codes in input document and then compresses this document using a syllable-based method. The second method, XMillSyl, incorporates syllable-based compression into the existing <b>method</b> for XML <b>compression</b> XMill.
