25|$|To {{understand}} why the two distributions are different, we may <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> extreme example: An urn contains one red ball with the weight 1000, and a thousand white balls each with the weight 1.

25|$|A {{compelling}} {{reason for not}} allowing division by zero is that, if it were allowed, many absurd results (i.e., fallacies) would arise.

25|$|Fig. 3-1 {{illustrates}} that in Newton's theory, time is universal, not {{the velocity of}} light. <b>Consider</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> thought experiment: The red arrow illustrates a train that is moving at 0.4c {{with respect to the}} platform. Within the train, a passenger shoots a bullet with a speed of 0.4c in the frame of the train. The blue arrow {{illustrates that}} a person standing on the train tracks measures the bullet as traveling at 0.8c. This is in accordance with our naive expectations.|$|E
25|$|To further {{highlight}} {{the difference between}} a problem and an instance, <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> instance of the decision version of the traveling salesman problem: Is there a route of at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of Germany's 15 largest cities? The quantitative answer to this particular problem instance is of little use for solving other instances of the problem, such as asking for a round trip through all sites in Milan whose total length is at most 10km. For this reason, complexity theory addresses computational problems and not particular problem instances.|$|E

25|$|To {{understand}} what happens, <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> analogy. Someone throws one ball every second at a man. Assume that balls travel with constant velocity. If the thrower is stationary, the man will receive one ball every second. However, if the thrower is moving towards the man, he will receive balls more frequently because the balls {{will be less}} spaced out. The inverse is true if the thrower is {{moving away from the}} man. So it is actually the wavelength which is affected; as a consequence, the received frequency is also affected. It may also be said that the velocity of the wave remains constant whereas wavelength changes; hence frequency also changes.|$|E
25|$|Hick {{suggests}} that when listing {{the attributes of}} God, the starting point should be his self-existence ("aseity") which implies that his eternal and unconditioned nature. Hick goes on to <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> additional attributes: Creator being {{the source of all}} that composes his creation ("creatio ex nihilo") and the sustainer of what he has brought into being; Personal; Loving, Good; and Holy. Berkhof also starts with self-existence but moves on to immutability; infinity, which implies perfection eternity and omnipresence; unity. He then analyses a series of intellectual attributes: knowledge-omniscience; wisdom; veracity and then, the moral attributes of goodness (including love, grace, mercy and patience); holiness and righteousness before dealing finally with his sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|Fractional Fourier {{transform}} {{can be used}} in {{time frequency}} analysis and DSP. It is useful to filter noise, but with the condition that it does not overlap with the desired signal in the time–frequency domain. <b>Consider</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> example. We cannot apply a filter directly to eliminate the noise, but {{with the help of the}} fractional Fourier transform, we can rotate the signal (including the desired signal and noise) first. We then apply a specific filter, which will allow only the desired signal to pass. Thus the noise will be removed completely. Then we use the fractional Fourier transform again to rotate the signal back and we can get the desired signal.|$|E

25|$|<b>Consider</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> {{strategy}} profiles: {{the leader}} plays Cournot; the follower plays Cournot if the leader plays Cournot and the follower plays non-Stackelberg if the leader plays Stackelberg {{and if the}} leader plays something else, the follower plays an arbitrary strategy (hence this actually describes several profiles). This profile is a Nash equilibrium. As argued above, on the equilibrium path play is a best response to a best response. However, playing Cournot {{would not have been}} the best response of the leader were it that the follower would play Stackelberg if it (the leader) played Stackelberg. In this case, the best response of the leader would be to play Stackelberg. Hence, what makes this profile (or rather, these profiles) a Nash equilibrium (or rather, Nash equilibria) {{is the fact that the}} follower would play non-Stackelberg if the leader were to play Stackelberg.|$|E
