Paired departure to <b>closed</b> <b>spaced</b> {{parallel runways}} can effectively improve capacity of terminal, and also can solve congestion of busy airport, {{but it also}} increases the complexity of air traffic control. For ensuring safety operation of paired departure, the longitudinal collision risk of paired departure to <b>closed</b> <b>spaced</b> parallel runways was studied. Based on the acceleration error distribution and requirements on wake avoidance during paired departure, a longitudinal collision risk safety assessment model of <b>closed</b> <b>spaced</b> parallel runways paired departure was built. The parameters in this model were determined by providing the calculation models. In the end, an example was calculated to verify the model, {{and it turns out}} that this model is feasible. 1 Introduction With the rapid development of the air transport industry, most of the domestic airport, especially hub airports are facing increasingly serious traffic congestion problems. Paired departure to <b>closed</b> <b>spaced</b> parallel runways can effectively improve capacity of terminal, however, due to <b>closed</b> <b>spaced</b> parallel runways distance between the two runways is less than 760 m, it increases the complexity of runway operation. There were significant differences between paired departure an...|$|R

The report, drawing on funders' workshops on <b>closing</b> <b>space,</b> and other reports and responses, shares the perspectives of numerous donors, civil society representatives, and experts engaged with this issue and offers ways of aligning work moving forward. This report comes from the Funders' Initiative for Civil Society (FICS), which a number of donor organisations have committed funds to set up, and which aims to develop a coherent and strategic response to this trend. This new initiative will help private funders align their efforts in this field, provide information to civil society organisations about the different forms of support available, begin to build crosssector networks between humanitarian, environmental, development, democracy and peace-building, indigenous rights, social change and human rights funders, and start work on creating better channels of communication with state actors and international institutions...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{an updated version}} of a report of the same title {{published}} by CAF in April 2016 to coincide with an official visit from Maina Kiai, UN Special Rapporteur on the rights to peaceful assembly and of association (a follow-up visit to his 2013 review), who spoke about the <b>closing</b> <b>space</b> for civil society at Parliamentary event hosted by CAF. That report sought to raise awareness of the impact that UK policy - given position of leadership and long history of cultivating civil society - could have on the <b>closing</b> <b>space</b> for civil society globally. That 'Discussion paper n° 5 ' briefly explores the nature of the UK's soft power and how it can be wielded, before looking at recent global policy developments restricting the ability of CSOs to advocate; a trend that has become known as the 'closing space for civil society.

40|$|I am {{interested}} in two spaces obverse to each other: open and <b>closed.</b> An open <b>space</b> develops organically based on how people inhabit it. Interacting with an open space is a dynamic, sporadic, multisensory, immersive, and subjective experience. In such spaces, we are confronted with an alternative aesthetic, one that is {{in conflict with the}} seamlessness of a <b>closed</b> <b>space.</b> A <b>closed</b> <b>space</b> is anchored on definite variables like structure, use and boundaries. While interaction between people and space is important, the space is tightly controlled and interaction is designed. Through this thesis project, I present a method that metaphorically transforms the experience of a walk through a <b>closed</b> <b>space</b> into an open-ended and immersive experience. When space develops as a response to our actions, it affords intimacy and a sense of belonging. It facilitates deeper expressiveness through engagement. By applying a method that uses fragmentation, recurrence and motion, I am metaphorically transforming an urban <b>closed</b> <b>space</b> to open. Through this transformation I am creating a fresh person-space dialogue that temporarily destabilizes perception and encourages physical sensation which allows for an intimate experience of the space. An immersive interaction with an open space transgresses the urban sterility of a <b>closed</b> <b>space</b> and is capable of creating a diversity of distinct experiences...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{questions}} that is being addressed at present by SDI Multimegawatt Space Power Project {{is whether or not}} space weapon power systems must be closed, i. e., whether effluents from the systems are tolerable. If they are not tolerable, the major penalty that must be paid to close space systems is increased mass. Open systems remove waste heat by producing effluents, e. g., hot hydrogen gas. Closed systems require radiators, thermal storage masses, effluent storage, or refrigeration to remove waste heat. The mass penalty incurred by addition of these devices is so severe that the option of <b>closing</b> <b>space</b> power systems should be avoided if at all possible.

Individuals on the software development team have multiple work elements that they attend to concurrently, by rotating their attention among various elements, much as a juggler keeps multiple objects in the air. Our observations of this distributed team show how the work of software development proceeds by selectively opening or <b>closing</b> <b>space</b> in order to experience a different pace of time.

40|$|Since 2005, {{international}} {{civil society}} support has faced increasing resistance around the world. Ethiopia is {{widely recognized as}} a key example of this so-called <b>Closing</b> <b>Space</b> phenomenon. With the Charities and Societies Proclamation (CSP), adopted in 2009, Ethiopia has established strict regulations on civil society organizations that, in particular, restrict the ability of local associations {{to make use of}} foreign funding as well as the range of activities allowed for foreign (funded) organizations. In this working paper the authors trace the process of international negotiations that has accompanied the drafting of the Ethiopian NGO law and identify the consequences of these negotiations for international civil society support in the country. Focusing on the interaction between foreign “donors” and the Ethiopian govern­ment, the authors analyze (a) what precisely these negotiations have been about, (b) to what extent these negotiations have actually influenced the content of the CSP, and (c) how the CSP as finally adopted has actually affected international civil society support in Ethiopia.

Two designs of orthodontic loops for <b>closing</b> <b>space</b> were analyzed: teardrop-shaped (T) and circle-shaped loop (C), of two different heights (6 and 8 mm), and two types of orthodontic wires (stainless steel – 0. 19 ’ × 0. 25 ’; TMA – titanium molybdenum alloy – 0. 016 ’ × 0. 016 ’). The sample consisted of 80 loops, divided into 8 groups determined by the combination shape/height/type of wire, which were submitted to tensile testing at a speed of 2 mm/min., to measure the quantity of force generated when activated in the interval of 0. 75 mm and 2. 25 mm. The results were submitted to the ANOVA and Tukey statistical tests to com-pare the groups, and the Student’s-t test to compare the means of two groups. Statistically higher values were observed for the size 6 mm, circle shape and stainless steel composition. The group “teardrop- 8 mm-TMA ” together with the group “circle- 8 mm-TMA ” presented the lowest mean value, differing sta-tistically from all of the other groups.

30|$|All {{categories}} also tolerated {{persistence of}} deciduous {{teeth in the}} arch even more {{in the case of}} symmetric solutions (simulation A was ranked lower than simulation C by all the categories of respondents) and if placed next to the canines with its cusp camouflaged (simulation H more accepted than simulation C in all four groups). All simulations associated with orthodontic treatment (L, M, and N) were {{at the top of the}} rank, considering attractiveness of smile for all the four categories, except for simulation I, probably due to the asymmetry and midline shift. Simulation L indicated space closure treatment in the case of bilateral agenesis, and it was ranked lower than simulations M and N where other variables were modified such as restorative and periodontal procedures. This is maybe due to the fact that, even in the drawings, anatomical differences between the lateral incisors and canines are evident also for patients and laypeople. The lateral incisor is smaller and flat-faced, while the canine is more conical. Hence, when <b>closing</b> <b>space</b> option is chosen, clinicians should plan cosmetic procedures at the end of orthodontic treatment to make the canines look more similar to the lateral incisors' shape. The option considered most appreciable was simulation N. In this picture, space closure with camouflage and bleaching of relocated canines and periodontal and gingival margins correction was simulated. Space closure treatment with grinding of cuspids (simulation M) was significantly considered as more attractive by laypeople and adult orthodontic patients when compared to orthodontists. Clinicians often suggest this treatment option, but they could tend to prefer more ideal options (simulation N) considering factors which may not affect judgment of laypeople and patients.|$|E
