25|$|Elizabeth Cole tells Hastings {{that she}} is a sister of Margaret Litchfield, who confessed to the murder of their father in one of the five cases. Margaret has died in Broadmoor Asylum and Elizabeth is stigmatised by the trauma. Three {{incidents}} occur in the next few days, showing the imprint of X. First, Hastings and others overhear an argument between the Luttrells. Shortly afterwards, Luttrell wounds his wife with a rook rifle, saying he mistook her for a rabbit. Mrs Luttrell recovers, and the incident has a good effect on their marriage. Next, Hastings is concerned that his daughter Judith spends time with Major Allerton, a married man. While Hastings and Elizabeth are out with birdwatcher Stephen Norton, Norton sees something through his binoculars that disturbs him. Hastings assumes {{it has to do with}} Allerton. When his attempts to persuade Judith to give Allerton up merely antagonise her, the worried father plans Allerton's murder. He falls asleep while waiting to poison Allerton, relieved he took no action when he awakes the next day. Last, Barbara Franklin, wife of Judith's employer Dr Franklin, dies the following evening. She was poisoned with physostigmine sulphate, an extract from the <b>Calabar</b> <b>bean</b> that her husband researches. Poirot's testimony at the inquest, that Mrs Franklin had been upset and that he saw her emerge from Dr Franklin's laboratory with a small bottle, persuades the jury to return a verdict of suicide.|$|E
500|$|At {{the lowest}} point in Julian's career, his former mentor, William Blanchard, threw him a much-needed lifeline. [...] Blanchard offered Julian a {{position}} to teach organic chemistry at DePauw University in 1932. Julian then helped Josef Pikl, a fellow student at the University of Vienna, {{to come to the}} United States to work with him at DePauw. In 1935 Julian and Pikl completed the total synthesis of physostigmine and confirmed the structural formula assigned to it. Robert Robinson of Oxford University in the U.K. had been the first to publish a synthesis of physostigmine, but Julian noticed that the melting point of Robinson's end product was wrong, indicating that he had not created it. When Julian completed his synthesis, the melting point matched the correct one for natural physostigmine from the <b>calabar</b> <b>bean.</b>|$|E

He could attest to these results first-hand, because Laqueur suffered from glaucoma, a fact that was kept secret from his medical colleagues until after his death. Laqueur died in Santa Margherita Ligure on April 20, 1909.|$|E
50|$|The Efik people, {{living in}} the Akwa Ibom State for Ibibio people, {{in what is now}} the {{south-east}} of Nigeria, were the first to come in contact with physostigmine, the active ingredient in the <b>Calabar</b> <b>bean.</b> The <b>Calabar</b> <b>bean,</b> or chopping nut, was very prevalent in Efik culture as an ordeal poison. Individuals accused of witchcraft would drink the white, milky extract of the bean, made by crushing the bean in a mortar and soaking the remains in water. If the accused died, it was considered proof of their use of witchcraft. If they lived, usually due to vomiting up the poison, then they were declared innocent and sent free.|$|E

50|$|<b>Calabar</b> <b>bean</b> {{contains}} physostigmine, a reversible {{cholinesterase inhibitor}} alkaloid.

50|$|Physostigma venenosum (the <b>Calabar</b> <b>bean</b> or ordeal bean) is {{the seed}} of a leguminous plant, a native of {{tropical}} Africa, poisonous to humans.

50|$|Robertson {{made several}} {{contributions}} {{in the field of}} ophthalmology; in 1863 he researched the effects on the eye made by physostigmine, an extract from the <b>Calabar</b> <b>bean</b> (Physostigma venenosum), which is found in tropical Africa. He correctly predicted that physostigmine would become very important in the treatment of eye disorders. He also described a symptom of neurosyphilis that affects the pupils of the eye, a condition known today as Argyll Robertson pupils.|$|E
50|$|The {{plants that}} are rich in non-isoprenoid indole {{alkaloids}} include harmal (Peganum harmala), which contains harmane, harmine and harmaline, and <b>Calabar</b> <b>bean</b> (Physostigma venenosum) containing physostigmine. Some {{members of the family}} Convolvulaceae, in particular Ipomoea violacea and Turbina corymbosa, contain ergolines and lysergamides. Despite the considerable structural diversity, most of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids is localized in three families of dicotyledon plants: Apocynaceae (genera Alstonia, Aspidosperma, Rauwolfia and Catharanthus), Rubiaceae (Corynanthe) and Loganiaceae (Strychnos).|$|E
50|$|In 1846, European missionaries {{arrived in}} what was {{referred}} to as Old Calabar, now part of Nigeria. These missionaries wrote about the use of the <b>Calabar</b> <b>bean</b> as a test for witchcraft. These beans eventually made their way back to Scotland, the home of these particular missionaries, where in 1855 Robert Christison, a toxicologist, tested the toxicity of the poison on himself by eating one. He survived to document the experience. The bean was studied throughout the 1860s by a few different Edinburgh scientists, including Douglas Argyll Robertson who wrote a paper on the use of <b>Calabar</b> <b>bean</b> extract on the eye and was the first to use it medicinally, and Thomas Richard Fraser who researched how to best extract the active principle, which was later determined to be physostigmine. Fraser also studied the antagonism between physostigmine and atropine extremely rigorously, {{at a time when the}} concept of antagonism had little if any experimental support. Fraser's research is still the basis of today's knowledge about the interactions between atropine and physostigmine at many different and specific doses. Physostigmine's first use as a treatment for glaucoma was by Ludwig Laqueur in 1876. Laqueur himself suffered from glaucoma so, like Christison, he experimented on himself, although Laqueur was much more scientific and methodical in his self-treatment.|$|E
50|$|In 1889 and 1890 he {{reported}} about an arrow poison used in coastal areas of Kenya and Nigeria and analyzed the highly poisonous <b>Calabar</b> <b>bean</b> and Strophanthus hispidus. From 1898 to 1899 {{he was president}} of the Government Commission for the research on the plague in India. He served as President of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh from 1900 to 1902. In 1902 he was knighted by King Edward VII for his work on the Indian Plague Commission. In 1908 he was elected President of the Association of Physicians of Great Britain and Ireland.|$|E
50|$|The {{action of}} some indole {{alkaloids}} {{has been known}} for ages. Aztecs used the psilocybin mushrooms which contain alkaloids psilocybin and psilocin. The flowering plant Rauwolfia serpentina which contains reserpine was a common medicine in India around 1000 BC. Africans used the roots of the perennial rainforest shrub Iboga, which contain ibogaine, as a stimulant. An infusion of <b>Calabar</b> <b>bean</b> seeds was given to people accused of crime in Nigeria: its rejection by stomach was regarded as a sign of innocence, otherwise, the person was killed via the action of physostigmine, which is present in the plant and which causes paralysis of the heart and lungs.|$|E
50|$|The main {{antidote}} to <b>Calabar</b> <b>bean</b> poisoning is the slightly less toxic tropane alkaloid atropine, which may often succeed; {{and the other}} measures are those usually employed to stimulate the circulation and respiration. Unfortunately, the antagonism between physostigmine and atropine is not perfect, and Sir Thomas Richard Fraser has shown that in such cases {{there comes a time}} when, if the action of the two drugs is summated, death results sooner than from either alone. Thus atropine will save life if three and a half times the fatal dose of physostigmine has been taken, but will hasten the end if four or more times the fatal dose has been ingested.|$|E

50|$|He {{then spent}} {{a short time}} in London, {{studying}} under John Abernethy and Sir William Lawrence, and in Paris, where he learnt analytical chemistry from Pierre Robiquet and toxicology from Mathieu Orfila. In 1822 he returned to Edinburgh as professor of medical jurisprudence, and set to work to organise the study of his subject on a sound basis. On poisons in particular he speedily became a high authority; his well-known treatise on them was published in 1829, {{and in the course}} of his inquiries he did not hesitate to try such daring experiments on himself as taking large doses of <b>Calabar</b> <b>bean</b> (Physostigmine). In 1827, he was appointed physician-in-ordinary to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, a position he held until 1832. His attainments in medical jurisprudence and toxicology procured him the appointment, in 1829, of medical officer to the crown in Scotland, and from that time until 1866 he was called as a witness in many celebrated criminal cases.|$|E

40|$|The {{history of}} {{glaucoma}} pharmacology begins in 1862 with {{the isolation of}} physostigmine from the <b>calabar</b> <b>bean.</b> The discovery of epinephrine’s intraocular pressure lowering capacity came just after WWI.

The drugs share a novel mechanism of action that produces a potent ocular hypotensive effect and a novel local adverse effect of increased iridial pigmentation. Anti-glaucoma medication targets different key pathophysiological aspects of the disease and overlap in the mechanisms of action of these drugs proved to be important. The development of a completely new class of drugs added to the suppressive armamentarium against this blinding condition. More drug variety skewed glaucoma care away from the theatre, effectively changing the timing of glaucoma surgery. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Interest in {{the colored}} {{decomposition}} products of physostigmine began {{as early as}} did the attempts to prepare a pure alkaloid from the <b>calabar</b> <b>bean.</b> Thus, {{in the work of}} Jobst and Hesse (1) and Hesse (2) in which alkali was used to precipitate the alkaloid or to aid in the extraction with ether, the authors noted the red color which rapidly appeared in alkaline solutions of physostigmine. Their observation that the color formation was slow in sodium bicarbonte solu-tion, much more rapid in sodium carbonate solution, and immediate in am-monium hydroxide solution may be interpreted to mean that the hydroxyl ion concentration controls the rate of formation of this red color [see paper No. II (3) of this series for a detailed study of the rate of destruction and its dependence upon pH]. Under certain conditions blue coloration in the physostigmine prep-arations was also detected by these authors.

Jobst and Hesse (1864) made purified extracts of the alkaloid and described some of its chemical reactions. Hesse later (1867) identified its chemical composition. Harnack and Wilkowsky (1876) in Schmiedeberg’s laboratory determined the chemical nature and the systemic effects of physostigmine, and a summary of these results appears in the several editions of Schmiedeberg’s Grundriss der Pharmacologie.

40|$|The use of organophosphorus and {{carbamate}} pesticides {{has increased}} markedly {{during the past}} two decades. Currently, more than 100 different organophosphorus and carbamate chemicals are registered as the active ingredients in thousands of different pesticide products in the United States. More than 160 million acre-treatments of these pesticides are estimated to be applied to agricultural crops and forests each year. Clearly, these two groups of chemicals constitute a major portion of all pesticides used today. Organophosphorus and carbamate compounds have histories dating back long before their use as pesticides. Carbamates were developed during investigation of 2 ̆ 2 ordeal 2 ̆ 2 poisons used in Africa and made from the <b>calabar</b> <b>bean,</b> which contains the only known naturally occurring carbamate ester (Kuhr and Dorough 1976). The insecticidal activity of carbamates was discovered in 1931 and developed in the mid-to-late 19402 ̆ 7 s. Large quantities were being produced and used by the late 19502 ̆ 7 s (Kuhr and Dorough 1976). Although much research on organophosphorus compounds was done in the 19 th century, the insecticidal activity of these chemicals was not discovered until 1937 (Eto 1974). In Germany, during World War II, the compounds were rapidly developed as insecticides, and during the 19502 ̆ 7 s the commercial use of organophosphates expanded markedly (Eto 1974). Presently, organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides are used as insecticides, herbicides, nematicides, acaricides, fungicides, rodenticides, and bird repellents throughout the world. The discovery that organochlorine pesticides, such as DDT, are highly persistent, bioconcentrate in food chains, and can severely affect whole populations or species of wildlife has led to bans and use restrictions (Stickel 1975). The decreased use of organochlorine pesticides has further expanded the market for the less-persistent organophosphates and carbamates (Murphy 1975 : Stickel 1975). Today, organophosphorus and carbamate pesticide use is widespread On agricultural crops, rangelands, forests, and wetlands, and undoubtedly exposes many wildlife species to chemical hazards. Organophosphorus compounds represent the largest group of insecticides known (McEwen and Stephenson 1979). During the past decade, there has been {{an increase in the number}} of reports of wildlife die-offs related to organophosphorus and carbamate pesticide use.
