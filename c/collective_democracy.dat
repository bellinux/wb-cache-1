40|$|Recent trends {{suggest that}} young people in Britain are {{increasingly}} rejecting electoral politics. However, evidence suggests that British youth are not apolitical, but are becoming ever more sceptical of the ability of electoral politics to make a meaningful contribution to their lives. Why young people are adopting new political behaviour and values, however, is still a point of contention. Some authors have suggested that neoliberalism has influenced these new patterns of political engagement. This article will advance this critique of neoliberalism, giving attention to three different facets of neoliberalism and demonstrate how they combine to reduce young people’s expectations of political participation and {{their perceptions of the}} legitimacy of political actors. We combine ideational and material critiques to demonstrate how young people’s political engagement has been restricted by neoliberalism. Neoliberalism has influenced youth political participation through its critiques of <b>collective</b> <b>democracy,</b> by the subsequent transformations in political practice that it has contributed to, and through the economic marginalisation that has resulted from its shaping of governments’ monetary policy. This approach will be conceptually predicated on a definition of neoliberalism which acknowledges both its focus on reducing interventions in the economy, and also its productive capacity to modify society to construct market relations and galvanise competition amongst agents. From this definition, we develop the argument that neoliberal critiques of democracy, the subsequent changes in political practices which respond to these criticisms and the transformation in socioeconomic conditions caused by neoliberalism have coalesced to negatively influence young people’s electoral participation...|$|E

In the system, the responsibility for voting the shares of a firm (“voice”) is given to the people who ultimately provided the money, who, however, have to delegate it to proxy voting institutions.

What are then {{the prospects for}} democracy in the multi-level constellation that makes up the contemporary European political order? The European debate has taken the question of democracy beyond the nation state. But can there be democracy without nation and state? The authors present three different models for how democracy can be reconstituted within the multileveled European context. It can be reconstituted at the national level, as delegated democracy with a concomitant reframing of the EU as a functional regulatory regime. Democracy can be reconstituted through establishing the EU as a multi-national state based on a common identity(ies) and solidaristic allegiance strong enough to undertake <b>collective</b> action. <b>Democracy</b> can also be reconstituted {{through the development of}} a post-national Union with an explicit cosmopolitan imprint. This entails an EU with some governmental functions, and which actively takes measures to become a regional cosmopolitan entity in a reformed world order. These are the only viable models of European democracy, as these are the only ones that can ensure equal membership in a self-governing polity. They differ however with regard to both applicability and robustness. deliberative democracy; democracy; democratization; Europeanization; federalism; intergovernmentalism; legitimacy; multilevel governance; supranationalism...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{argue that}} {{religion}} matters {{for the emergence}} of democracies and dictatorships. Religion is defined as a stochastically set demand for public goods. Different types of religious collectives reflect different tradeoffs between centralized resource distribution and market rewards. Religions are defined as collectivist, when their respective collectives facilitate the hierarchical provision of common pool resources toward their members at the expense of market incentives. Religions are defined as individualist, when their respective collectives recruit and preserve their members on the basis of market incentives. Islam, Orthodoxy and Catholicism are treated as collectivist religions, whereas Judaism and Protestantism as individualist ones. I provide a historical overview that designates the Jewish kibbutz as the <b>collective</b> of <b>democracy</b> and the Russian-Orthodox monastery as the collective of dictatorship. Assuming a collectivist economy, I solve the radical government and modernization stochastic games. I find that modernization occurs in a collectivist economy when the threat of a radical government is imminent and when the leader has high extraction rents over the economy. In order to stay in power, the leader credibly commits to provide more public goods in the future, and thus modernization occurs. Underdevelopment occurs at intermediate levels of state enforcement, modernization at low levels and centralization at high levels of state enforcement. The emergence of a radical government is more likely in a collectivist rather than in an individualist economy...|$|R

There, tourism practice and discourse in Mapuche rural communities reflect Mapuche responses to a recent phase of policies targeting them under the rubric of "Development with Identity".

On the surface, {{there seems to be}} business as usual: Lukashenko’s regime remains unchallenged; Belarus’ relations with the European Union – spasmodic at best; while its absorption into Russia’s Eurasian project continues apace. Yet, some critical disjunctures – manifested in government tacit resistance to Russia’s influence, and more instructively, in people’s growing affinity with Europe – may indicate a sea-change transformation in the very fabric of society. This article, utilizing extensive and subject-focused research, conducted in the country between 2009 and 2013, examines the nature and causalities of the occurring change. It argues that democracy promotion, in Belarus’ case, may work better when depoliticized and inculcated, through norms, regulations, and practices of international order, into the daily lives of individuals. Through its continued technocratic, inclusive, and sector-level engagement, European Union governance, even under the conditions of limited bilateral dialogue, have succeeded in fostering much-needed space for reciprocal learning and critical reasoning, which may have far greater transformative potential than manufacturing a single <b>collective</b> will for <b>democracy</b> building...|$|R

Richard Balme and Didier Chabanet analyze the influence of supranational governance on democratization through a wealth of case studies on {{a broad range of}} civil society interests, including regional policy, unemployment and poverty, women's rights, migration policy, and environmental protection. The authors trace the evolving relationship between citizens and European institutions over the past decades, especially as public support for deepening and widening integration has waned.

At least two truisms were proven wrong during this tumultuous period: that European citizens have little interest in European integration and that citizens have little influence on EU politics. However, this power shift has left citizens with a deep distrust of integration and EU institutions with limited capacities to cope with issues the public considers priorities-primarily unemployment and social inequalities.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. Since {{the collapse of}} the Communist bloc, Mongolia has pursued the independent foreign policy with balanced relations attached to the two great neighbors - Russia and China. Meanwhile, the search for a "third neighbor" (the United States, Japan and/or the <b>collective</b> community of <b>democracies)</b> has been seen as the alternative approach to the existing "neighbor-oriented" policy. The thesis argues that both approaches are not mutually exclusive schools of foreign policy, but rather constitute the common approach that is described within this research as "bufferism. " To present an alternative vision of the nation's foreign policy orientation, the thesis covers the major schools of international relations and identifies the two major causes of policy: identity (based on constructivism) and interest (based on realism). As a nation, Mongolia faces the identity trilemma and the security dilemma, without much preference given to any of these options during the last decade. Hence appears the nation's ambiguity in identity, security and economic development. The thesis puts the argument that without prioritizing one option, Mongolia faces the risk of degrading into a failing state isolated from the global affairs.

The paper argues that these programmes do not stand outside the realm of EU intervention but can be analysed from an EU law perspective via i) an understanding of national security in a democratic rule of law framework where fundamental human rights and judicial oversight constitute key norms; ii) the risks posed to the internal security of the Union as a whole as well as the privacy of EU citizens as data owners and iii) the potential spillover into the activities and responsibilities of EU agencies.

40|$|Recent {{experiences}} of social movements in South America {{and the expansion}} of non- institutional forms of collective action have given rise to new conceptual frameworks such as participatory democracy, which aim to capture the impact of new forms of participation and <b>collective</b> action on <b>democracy</b> in the region. As a means of exploring the possibilities of deepening democracy, such frameworks have taken as their focal point the institutionalisation of 'alternative' forms and processes of participation. However, the focus on institutionalisation has usually bypassed the more radical dimensions of the discourses and practices of the movements—the ‘disagreement’ at their heart. By way of illustrative cases of two contemporary movements from Argentina (Piqueteros) and Brazil (Movement of Rural Landless Workers) we focus on two questions: What is the contribution of social movements to the process of democratisation? To what extent is such contribution being captured by new scholarly work on participatory and deliberative democracy? We analyse the political struggle within, against and beyond democratic ‘borders’ led by social movements in three historical moments. By distinguishing the dimensions of ‘real policies’ and ‘imagined politics’ we suggest that new conceptualisations such as ‘participatory democracy’ are unable to recognise the alternative democratic realities that emerge out of disagreement and play a regulatory role in transforming disagreement into dissent. Hope is then lost in translation. We suggest that Radical Democratic Theory can offer a better work of translation, as it is able to grasp the vital dimension of movements’ collective action that resists integration into the hegemonic cannon, thus reflecting the movements’ own reflection of their emancipatory collective action...|$|R
40|$|The {{combined}} {{challenges of}} food insecurity, agriculture-related environmental decline, corporate concentration, {{and the decline}} of community resilience are being met by growing societal interest in developing more just and sustainable food systems. A recent emphasis on cooperation and innovative forms of collective action within the food movement invokes a community-centered approach to food provisioning where <b>collective</b> problem-solving and <b>democracy</b> take center place in the development agenda (Ikerd, 2012). Cooperative alternative food networks are becoming powerful tools for community development and important vehicles for cultivating democratically controlled food systems at multiple scales. The papers in this special issue provide an important contribution {{to our understanding of the}} function, the challenges, and the potential of collective action in enabling more just and resilient food systems. Cooperative alternative food networks represent a break from the competitive productivism of the dominant food economy and create new relational spaces that hold promise for overcoming the pragmatic and political limits of some of the more individualistic approaches in the local/ sustainable food movement. These include cooperative forms of: food hubs, local food networks, farmers' markets, CSAs, box schemes, buying clubs, and value chains, along with a range of agriculture and food cooperatives owned by farmers, consumers, workers, and in emerging multistakeholder cooperative structures. With a renewed emphasis on civic governance, the resulting food-provisioning systems are based on principles of participatory democracy, solidarity, and reciprocity (Renting, Schermer, & Rossi, 2012) and provide spaces to nurture collective subjectivities required for transformative food practice and politics (Levkoe, 2011) [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{examines}} John Dewey’s {{concept of}} “growth ” as offering a fruitful {{angle of vision}} by which to mediate the pedagogy and politics of adult literacy education, particularly {{within the context of}} normative settings of adult basic education classes and volunteer literacy programs within contemporary U. S. society. That is, his philosophy of pragmatism may be viewed as a symbolic midway point between structural-functional views of literacy linked to the stabilization of the status quo and more radical Freirian variants that seek substantial transformation of the social order. Dewey succinctly defines growth as the enhancement of living experience through the exercise of critical thought and reflective action. For Dewey (1938), such growth is continuous as long as life endures. Thus, experience is not an end. Rather, “every experience should do something to prepare a person for later experiences of a deeper and more expansive quality ” (p. 47). Such “growth, ” or “reconstruction of experience ” (ibid.) contributes both to personal fulfillment, and in a <b>collective</b> sense, toward <b>democracy</b> wherein “free social inquiry is indissolubly wedded to the art of full and free communication ” Dewey, 1927, p. 134). If education is growth, it must progressively realize present possibilities, and thus make individuals better fitted to cope with later requirements. Growth is not something which is completed in odd moments; it is a continuous leading into the future (Dewey, 1916 a, p. 56). Each of us knows, for example, some mechanic of ordinary native capacity who is intelligent within the matters of his calling. He has lived in an environment in which the cumulative intelligence of a multitude of cooperating individuals is embodied, and by the use of his native capacities he makes some phase of this intelligence his own. Given a social medium in whose institutions the available knowledge, ideas and art of humanity were incarnate, and the average individual would rise to undreamed of heights of social and political intelligence (Dewey...|$|R
40|$|The {{beginning}} of the second decade of the 21 st century saw renewed attacks on public employee collective bargaining, which included claims that allowing public employees to organize and bargain collectively distorts democratic processes. These renewed attacks included the traditional claim that public employee collective bargaining inappropriately gives one interest group, workers and their unions, an avenue of access to public decision-makers that is not available to other interest groups. The attack also raised a new claim of distortion of democratic processes: that unions are inappropriately advantaged in the broader political process through agency shop or fair share and dues check-off provisions of their collective bargaining agreements. This article addresses both prongs of the claim that public employee <b>collective</b> bargaining distorts <b>democracy.</b> It argues that the recent response to the claim that unions gain an avenue of exclusive access to public decision-makers has been to increase employer unilateral control over terms and conditions of employment, a response that is at best counterproductive. It urges creative experimentation that breaks away {{from the private sector}} dichotomy that mandates traditional collective bargaining or leaves a matter to unilateral employer control to develop alternative forms for worker voice. The article then refutes the claim that agency shop or fair share fees and dues check-off inappropriately advantage unions in the public political process. It shows how arguments against agency shop and fair share fees misrepresent the law. It further shows that rather than privilege unions to use non-members’ money on ideological activity to which the non-members object, agency shop and fair share fees protect the union from having to divert resources that it might otherwise spend on ideological activity to subsidize services for non-members who are legally entitled to fair representation by the union. The article debunks the claim that dues check-off is coercive, establishing that it is voluntary, and demonstrates that the attacks on dues check-off are motivated by the attackers’ dislike for the positions taken by unions and not by any principled basis...|$|R
40|$|In {{economics}} prominence {{has been}} given to a peculiar reductionist view according to which ‘collective thinking’ is the straightforward result of the work of a specific algorithm - the social welfare function - by means of which any set of potential collective decisions may be ranked. The mental process is seen as the product of the work of a software. The question of which kind of hardware can support this software has been traditionally regarded as unimportant. In this paper the attempt is made to put forward a framework to explain public decisions which builds upon the hypothesis that ‘collective mind’ should not be analysed by abstracting from the features of collective brain. Indeed, collective mental processes will be interpreted as ‘caused’ by the structure of the collective brain that sustains them. It is suggested that the analysis of the collective brain ought to be the starting point in the search for a theory of public decisions. By defining collective brain as a ‘specialised network of individuals’ it will emerge that collective thinking is based on an ‘institutional base’ which is its fundamental causal factor of public decisions. But addressing the question of the ‘institutional base’ of collective thinking requires a new set of concepts and theoretical statements if one wants to give a meaning to the empirical evidence. A further step in the analysis will be the observation that in modern <b>democracies</b> <b>collective</b> brain is usually ‘partitioned’ and the collective mental process segmented. This segmentation has been historically accompanied by a remarkable increase in the specialised production of knowledge functional to collective decision-making. Collective brains become more differentiated {{as a result of the}} fact that they incorporate ‘technical units’ devoted to the production of knowledge. A further consequence of having a segmented mental process is the intrinsic ‘coevolutionary nature’ of collective thinking. Although to various degrees, each decisionmaker is (or ought to be) a system which is open in terms of informational flow. If collective decision-makers want to be up to their moral canons they have to use the relevant knowledge that is dispersed in the environment in their decision process. Coevolutionary collective thinking is both an observed phenomenon and a standard of collective behaviour. ...|$|R

Between 1978 and 1990, mental health professionals working within human rights organizations provided psychological therapy to approximately 32, 000 - 42, 000 Chileans to help them work through their traumatic experiences as part of a collective project to repair the social connections that state violence ripped apart. These professionals translated psychoanalytic concepts of “the self” into the language of pre- 1973 frameworks of citizenship grounded in the heterosexual, male-headed nuclear family. By the mid- 1980 s, Chile’s feminist movement changed the terms of the debate by showing how gendered forms of everyday violence that pre-dated the dictatorship shaped political violence under the dictatorship, as well as the opposition’s response. Slowly, mental health professionals began to change how they deployed ideas about gender when helping survivors and their families talk about state violence. However, the narratives of violence that emerged with the end of the dictatorship in 1990 and that were enshrined in three separate truth commissions (1990, 2004, and 2010) only partially reflected that transformation. The democratic governments’ attempts to heal Chile’s painful past and move forward did not always recognize, much less dislodge, entrenched ideas that privileged men’s experiences of political militancy. This dissertation shows how Chileans grappled with their memories of state violence, which were refracted through gendered discourses in the human rights movement...|$|R
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{asks whether}} there is a human right to democracy. This is a difficult question, not least because there is no consensus about either what democracy requires or how to interpret human rights. The introduction aims to alleviate these sources of confusion about the question itself, in addition to presenting the main arguments in favor of a human right to democracy, and my rationale to focus more narrowly on a question of toleration. The main discussions are organized around the idea that if democratic peoples should tolerate undemocratic peoples, then a human right to democracy does not exist. Part 1 uses discussions about corporate agency and the conditions of corporate responsibility to argue that a group's capacity for responsible collective agency depends on four things: its ability to form collective intentions, an internal culture that orients the formation of personal intentions to act in accordance with those collective intentions, agents authorized to act (vicariously) for the group, and an effective internal practice of public accountability. I also suggest reasons why it is sometimes appropriate for a collective entity to authorize the agents acting on its behalf to use coercion. (cont.) Part 2 uses these ideas of responsible collective agency and the grounds of legitimate coercion to interpret Rawls's idea of a people as a normative conception of collective self-determination. I explain why a people (in Rawls's sense) meets the four conditions of responsible <b>collective</b> agency, why <b>democracy</b> is not necessarily required for collective self-determination, and also why a people's government should possess coercive authority. Part 3 addresses directly whether democratic peoples should tolerate undemocratic peoples. Traditionally, theorizing about toleration tends to focus on the domestic relations of a given society, and is thus not clearly relevant to questions of toleration among peoples. Therefore, the bulk of Part 3 is devoted to developing an idea of international toleration. Based on this idea of international toleration, and the value of the self-determination of peoples, I argue that democratic peoples should tolerate undemocratic peoples. I conclude that a human right to democracy does not exist. by Karim Abdul-Matin. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Linguistics and Philosophy, September 2006.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} much {{political}} and academic interest in new modes of local governance, which are increasingly based on deliberative mechanisms and aim at engaging larger sectors of the population (i. e. governance by networks, territorial pacts, strategic planning). Whereas the literature on urban governance has focused on the emergence of novel governance arrangements at city and regional levels and on the formation of a <b>collective</b> actor, deliberative <b>democracy</b> scholars have examined the democratic dimension (i. e. the deliberative forums) and assessed the applicability of their normative models to the real world; the literature on planning helps to understand the implementation gap that plagues many of these new arrangements. All these approaches often study the same empirical phenomena, however, with a few exceptions, debates within these literatures take no account of one another. This comparative case-study of strategic planning in four medium-sized Italian cities (Trento, Prato, Lecce, and Sassari), characterized by different socio-political and economic contexts, intends to contribute to bridging the gap between the above theoretical paradigms. Thus, the impact of strategic planning on the local polity is assessed on three levels: the formation of a collective actor, the democratic process, and implementation. Comparative analysis can help to evidence how such an impact is either hindered or enhanced by different forms and resources of leadership and how the latter interact with endogenous (i. e. pre-existing associational density) and exogenous factors (i. e. institutional constraints and opportunities at other jurisdictional levels). Different typologies of leadership will influence each dimension of the dependent variable (i. e. the formation of the collective actor, the democratic process, the implementation) to varying degrees. The type of leadership now required within the new multilevel governance system could be defined as facilitative leadership, which arises from the activity of working with, rather than exercising power over, others. This leadership is no longer identified solely with political institutions but often emerges from the coordinated work of a political sponsor and a public service CEO that acts as the champion of the governance process. Institutional constraints might affect outcomes, as weak administrative capacity and resistance to change from within the bureaucracy will hinder implementation. A facilitative leadership can help to drive cultural change and organisational learning within local institutions, while offering identity incentives to the wider community. While pre-existing associational dynamics do not influence outcomes, since an inclusive leadership can encourage greater participation even where the social fabric would seem weaker, poor policy coordination among jurisdictional tiers will inevitably hamper the positive effects of strategic planning at the local level, which might be lost in a plethora of fragmented initiatives...|$|R
