40|$|Recent {{data have}} shown that left {{ventricular}} (I. V) geometry provides additional information on the simple dichotomy of {{presence or absence of}} LV hypertrophy with regard to cardiovascular risk of hypertensive patients. A "new" class of concentric remodeling was created, identifying a rather large group of hypertensive patients who do have increased risk despite no LV hypertrophy, Because determination of LV geometry is not easy, our objective was to develop a nomogram enabling determination of LV geometry in a simple way. The geometric classification is based on the combination of increased relative wall thickness and LV hypertrophy (LV mass index {{greater than or equal to}} 125 g/m(2)) both of which are calculated from wall thickness and end-diastolic diameter. In the nomogram the calculated <b>cutoff</b> <b>lines</b> for relative wall thickness and left ventricular hypertrophy are plotted, forming 4 quadrants that represent the geometric classes. Two nomograms are made: 1 based on Penn convention measurement calculations and 1 based on American Society of Echocardiography convention measurements. This nomogram provides a simple way to determine LV geometry, and thus a quick assessment of the additional cardiovascular risk of the hypertensive patient. This is especially important for subjects with concentric remodeling, who would otherwise not be identified as having increased risk for cardiovascular disease.

In conjunction with this improvement, the railroad inaugurated the Southwest Limited passenger train on the Kansas City route, utilizing new equipment and a faster schedule.The Southwest Limited prospered for the next three decades.

40|$|When {{reservoir}} pore pressures {{approach the}} fracture pressure {{the risk of}} hydrocarbon leakage increases {{as a result of}} mechanical failure. Here, relationships between overpressure, hydrocarbon column heights and seal capacities (fracture pressure – pore/aquifer pressure) will be explored, and best practice criteria for assessing seal capacity is discussed. The term overpressure (OP) can be applied to any formation with pore pressures higher than the hydrostatic pressure. From a 129 field database, critical shear failure pressures, fault reactivation pressures and tensile failure pressures were derived. Calculating the difference between such pressures and the aquifer pressures at structural crests within fields allows quantification of the envelope between the reservoir pressure and failure pressure - a term coined by Swarbrick et al. (2010) as “aquifer seal capacity” (ASC). Conventional approaches suggest that fractures will form when the pore fluid pressure equals that of σ 3 plus the tensile strength of the rock (Gaarenstroom et al. 1993; Converse et al. 2000; Nordgård Bolås & Hermanrud 2003; Winefield et al. 2005). However, there remains the distinct possibility that it is aquifer pressure that governs failure (Bjørkum et al. 1998; Swarbrick et al. 2010). This research suggests a convergence of the fracture pressure gradient and Sv at 14, 500 ft within the Central North Sea. At this point, the principal stresses switch. Furthermore, a general reduction in hydrocarbon column height (HCH) is observed with a) increasing aquifer OP and b) a reduction in ASC. The possibility of applying upper bound <b>cutoff</b> <b>lines</b> is explored, i. e. column heights are not expected greater than χ ft given an aquifer OP. The HPHT Shearwater field is an exception for all trends within the research. The concept of a protected trap is suggested as an explanation for this apparently anomalous trap integrity. Understanding the nature of how, when and why pressure-related seal failure occurs can help alleviate drilling dry holes and unsuccessful exploration ventures...|$|R

30|$|Further, {{there still}} exists some issues {{on how to}} decide a ‘right’ {{deprivation}} <b>cutoff,</b> poverty <b>line</b> and weights, {{although there are many}} studies in line with { 0, 1 } dichotomy of the derivation cutoff and equal weights in A–F applied studies, considering poverty also as a matter of degree rather than an attribute that is simply present or absent for individuals in the population, we had also tried to adopt the fuzzy measure to address the poverty-line robust, and the result is not so variable due to the relative little difference when compared to a simple { 0, 1 } dichotomy. To be specified, three poverty indexes, A, H, MPI, have not obvious changes until K =  6, when it may not make much sense for the practical work due to the improper K value that is the ideal value of 4.

50|$|The term 'Malmquist bias' has {{not always}} been {{definitively}} used to refer to the bias outlined above. As recently as the year 2000, the Malmquist bias has appeared in the literature clearly referring to different types of bias and statistical effect. The most common of these other uses is to refer to an effect that takes place with a magnitude limited sample, but in this case the low absolute magnitude objects are overrepresented. In a sample with a magnitude limit, there will be a margin of error near that boundary where objects that should be bright enough to make the cut are excluded and objects that are slightly below the limit are instead included. Since low absolute magnitude objects are more common than brighter ones, and since these dimmer galaxies {{are more likely to be}} below the <b>cutoff</b> <b>line</b> and scattered up, while the brighter ones are more likely to be above the line and scattered down, an over-representation of the lower luminosity objects result.

Data on hippuric acid (HA-U), toluene (Tol-U), creatinine (CR) and specific gravity (SG) in end-of-shift urine samples and exposure to air-borne toluene were cited from previous publications. In practice, 837 cases were available, and they were classified into dense, intermediate and dilute groups taking 0. 3 and 3. 0 g/l of CR and 1. 010 and 1. 030 of SG as <b>cutoff</b> points. <b>Lines</b> of regression of HA-U and Tol-U (as observed, CR-corrected or SG-corrected) with air-borne toluene were calculated for each density groups, and correlation coefficients (CCs) were compared.

These conclusions were however based primarily on the findings with observed values, because the numbers of cases in the dilute or dense group were limited when CR- or SG-correction was applied. Literature survey showed that urine density correction does not always improve the correlation between solvents in air and exposure makers in urine.
