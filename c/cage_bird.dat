5|$|Along {{with other}} Estrildines, these species {{are thought to}} have {{originated}} in Asia. The species has been introduced {{to other parts of the}} world due to its popularity as a <b>cage</b> <b>bird</b> and populations have established in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Up to {{at least}} the nineteenth century the song thrush was kept as a <b>cage</b> <b>bird</b> because of its melodious voice. As with hunting, there is little {{evidence}} that the taking of wild birds for aviculture has had a significant effect on wild populations.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the bulk}} of its range, it is among the commonest species of hummingbird, {{although}} it generally is uncommon in the outlying regions, particularly where it becomes more humid. In southern Brazil, it is apparently increasing and seems to have extended its range in recent decades. It {{is considered to be}} a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN. It was frequently exported for the <b>cage</b> <b>bird</b> trade up to 1970, but like other hummingbirds, it is nowadays on CITES Appendix II and trade is restricted. Also, hummingbirds are generally hard to keep in captivity, and though this species is generally rather hardy, it has been noted that abandoned young may die despite given optimal treatment when trying to hand-raise them.|$|E
500|$|Angelou's books, {{especially}} I Know Why the <b>Caged</b> <b>Bird</b> Sings, {{have been}} criticized by many parents, causing their removal from school curricula and library shelves. [...] According to the National Coalition Against Censorship, parents and schools have objected to <b>Caged</b> <b>Birds</b> depictions of lesbianism, premarital cohabitation, pornography, and violence. Some {{have been critical of}} the book's sexually explicit scenes, use of language, and irreverent depictions of religion. [...] <b>Caged</b> <b>Bird</b> appeared third on the American Library Association (ALA) list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000 and sixth on the ALA's 2000–2009 list.|$|R

60|$|MY DEAR HAMERTON, - Various {{things have}} been {{reminding}} me of my misconduct: First, Swan's application for your address; second, a sight of the sheets of your LANDSCAPE book; and last, your note to Swan, which he was so kind as to forward. I trust you will never suppose me to be guilty of anything more serious than an idleness, partially excusable. My ill-health makes my rate of life heavier than I can well meet, and yet stops me from earning more. My conscience, sometimes perhaps too easily stifled, but still (for my time {{of life and the}} public manners of the age) fairly well alive, forces me to perpetual and almost endless transcriptions. On the back of all this, my correspondence hangs like a thundercloud; and just when I think I am getting through my troubles, crack, down goes my health, I have a long, costly sickness, and begin the world again. It is fortunate for me I have a father, or I should long ago have died; but the opportunity of the aid makes the necessity none the more welcome. My father has presented me with a beautiful house here - or so I believe, for I have not yet seen it, being a <b>cage</b> <b>bird</b> but for nocturnal sorties in the garden. I hope we shall soon move into it, and I tell myself that some day perhaps we may have the pleasure of seeing you as our guest. I trust at least that you will take me as I am, a thoroughly bad correspondent, and a man, a hater, indeed, of rudeness in others, but too often rude in all unconsciousness himself; and that you will never cease to believe the sincere sympathy and admiration that I feel for you and for your work.|$|E
