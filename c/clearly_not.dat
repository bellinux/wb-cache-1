5|$|The League Cup was <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> one of Ferguson's main {{priorities}} of the season, as he used it to blood the younger and less-known players. After being swept aside {{in the third round}} by Ipswich Town – a team {{at the bottom of the}} First Division – Ferguson came under intense scrutiny for fielding a reshuffled squad. However, the manager felt that it was, at the time, an unwanted domestic distraction.|$|E
5|$|Black has {{the blood}} tested, and finds it {{free of any}} pathogen; meanwhile, the {{government}} center running the earlier briefing has vanished. Black realizes he was tricked into finding Zero for an ulterior motive, eventually learning that the organisation responsible is carrying out medical experiments on the homeless, and may be tied to the Millennium Group. Elsewhere a homeless man, acting similarly to Zero, attacks two policemen, and is killed in response. Black and fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) investigate, but are <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> welcome. Black manages to obtain a blood sample from the dead man, and finds a stretcher tag which he believes {{is connected to the}} United States Department of Energy.|$|E
5|$|Doge Domenico Contarini (10431071) had a {{relatively}} uneventful reign, healing the rift between the Doge and his subjects and regaining territory {{that had been}} lost in the east to the Kingdom of Croatia in the years following the deposition of Otto Orseolo. However, one fact remained: based on their actions {{in the first half of}} the 11th century, the majority of the people of Venice were <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> in favor of having a royal hereditary class. This reality, coupled with the fresh memories of power-hungry Doges, set the stage for Domenico Selvo.|$|E

To be sure, this intention was <b>not</b> <b>clearly</b> was <b>not</b> <b>clearly</b> expressed in the orders. It also soon became evident that the two fixed intercept stations did not suffice for long range intelligence.|$|R

5|$|During the half-time interval, Stein gave also Gordon Strachan {{notice that}} he planned to bring him off during the second half and replace him with winger Davie Cooper. Stein's five-man {{defensive}} set-up meant that his midfielders were outnumbered by the Welsh, and consequently Strachan had failed to make an impact on the game up to then. Despite this, Strachan was prepared to argue with Stein that he should remain on, until Alex Ferguson cautioned him to be aware that the manager was <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> well, and should not cause too much stress with a confrontation.|$|E
5|$|Significantly, the {{possibility}} that Dietrich may have been acquitted differentiates this case from the unsuccessful 1979 McInnis v R. appeal. McInnis, like Dietrich, had appealed to the High Court against his conviction, arguing that the failure to adjourn the proceedings while McInnis sought legal representation resulted in a miscarriage of justice. However, {{the majority in the}} McInnis appeal found that McInnis was very unlikely to have been acquitted, even with full representation. This was <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> the case with Dietrich.|$|E
5|$|The last {{semifinal}} {{match between}} LAX, accompanied by Guerrero and Salinas, and Styles and Super Eric. During the bout, Hernandez lifted Super Eric {{and held him}} upside-down vertically {{for an extended period}} of time before slamming him back-first into the mat with a delayed vertical suplex. Later, Styles held Homicide in a small package pin attempt until Salinas distracted the referee, allowing Guerrero to enter the ring and readjust Styles and Homicide to make the pin in LAX's favor. Afterwards, the referee counted the pin, giving LAX the win at seven minutes and forty seconds, although Styles' shoulders were <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> fully against the mat.|$|E

5|$|Van Eyck's {{earlier work}} often shows churches and cathedrals in older Romanesque style, {{sometimes}} {{to represent the}} Temple in Jerusalem as an appropriate historical setting, with decoration drawn exclusively from the Old Testament. That is <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> the case here – the Christ Child occupies the same space as a large rood cross depicting him being crucified. The church in this panel is contemporary Gothic – a choice perhaps intended to associate Mary with the Ecclesia Triumphans – while her pose and oversized scale are indebted to the forms and conventions of Byzantine art and the International Gothic. Van Eyck details the architecture with a precision not seen before in northern European painting.|$|E
5|$|Violent anti-church clashes in Tavastia, central Finland, {{mentioned}} {{in a letter}} by Pope Gregorius IX in 1237, {{have been attributed to}} Thomas' harsh methods of Christianization, but without direct evidence for that conjecture. The letter, addressed to the Archbishop of Uppsala, does not mention the Bishop or Diocese of Finland in any way. Information about the uprising had also originated from the temporarily sidelined Archbishop, who seems to have used the occasion to remind the Pope about Uppsala's earlier contributions to the missionary work in the north. The Pope had <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> known where Tavastia exactly was, and eloquently urged the Archbishop to send in a crusade.|$|E
5|$|According to Njáls saga, Gilli {{was seated}} on Kola or Kolu, an island {{that appears to}} refer to Coll or perhaps Colonsay. The saga also states that Gilli was married to Sigurðr's sister, Hvarflǫð. This marital {{alliance}} appears to further evince the southward extension of Sigurðr's influence. This union, along with the record of apparent amiable dealings with Sigurðr's associates, suggests that Gilli and Sigurðr indeed enjoyed close relations. The earl's family was <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> adverse to marrying into native dynasties, as Sigurðr's own mother {{was the daughter of}} an Irish king, whilst his wife was the daughter of a Scottish king. In fact, the aforesaid sources appear to indicate that Gilli operated in the Hebrides as a tributary earl to his brother-in-law. Certainly, Eyrbyggja saga states that Sigurðr left menn ("agents") in the Hebrides to collect tax from Mann, whilst Orkneyinga saga reveals that, at a later period in time, Sigurðr's son and successor, Þórfinnr Sigurðarson, Earl of Orkney (died c. 1065), tasked a member of his own wife's family, Kálfr Árnason (died 1051), to impose Orcadian authority in the Isles.|$|E

5|$|Estimates put {{the average}} energy {{density of the}} Universe at the {{equivalent}} of 5.9 protons per cubic meter, including dark energy, dark matter, and baryonic matter (ordinary matter composed of atoms). The atoms account for only 4.6% of the total energy density, or a density of one proton per four cubic meters. The density of the Universe, however, is <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> uniform; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies, such as planets, stars, and black holes—to conditions in vast voids that have much lower density, {{at least in terms}} of visible matter. Unlike the matter and dark matter, the dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the Universe, dark energy's influence is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|Garamond {{designed}} type for the Greek alphabet {{from the}} beginning of his attested career, but his most celebrated work in Greek, the Grecs du roi fonts, commissioned for the French government in 1540, are very different to his Latin designs: they attempt to simulate the elegant handwriting of Cretan scribe Angelo Vergecio and include a vast variety of alternate letters and ligatures to achieve this. This style is impractical for modern setting of body text, since it requires careful manual choice of characters for every word. Several 'Garamond' releases such as Adobe's contain Greek designs that are either a compromise between Garamond's upright Latin designs and his slanted Greek ones or primarily inspired by his Latin designs. The grecs du roi type, the contract for which survives, is the type with which Garamond enters the historical record, although it is <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> the work of a beginner. Earlier fonts that may have been cut by Garamond have been suggested but the attribution is less certain.|$|E
5|$|In 1299, George's son and Aldimir's nephew Theodore Svetoslav (r. 1300–1322), the {{legitimate}} {{successor to the}} Bulgarian throne, invaded Bulgaria along with Tatar troops. The news of that invasion was enough to force Smiltsena and Ivan to flee to the despotate of Kran even before Theodore Svetoslav's troops had reached the capital. Aldimir gave refuge to Smiltsena and Ivan, though he was <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> opposed to his newly crowned nephew. In 1300, Smilets' brother sebastokrator Radoslav headed a Byzantine-supported campaign against Aldimir {{en route to the}} capital. However, the attack had disastrous consequences to Radoslav. He was captured by Aldimir, blinded and forced back to Thessaloniki, while his Byzantine generals were sent as captives to Theodore Svetoslav. With this act, Aldimir pledged his allegiance to Theodore Svetoslav, who rewarded him with an extension to his appanage. The despotate of Kran was enlarged to the east to include the fortresses of Yambol and Lardea near today's Karnobat.|$|E

The two visit Dr. Calderon, who tells them that Emily was part of clinical trials and that Roberta was paid the money {{to keep her from}} pulling Emily from the program. Marshall Sim is arrested for the murder of his wife. Scully visits Emily and gives her the cross necklace. Marshall confesses soon after, but is found dead in his cell shortly after being visited by the two dark-suited men. Bill shows Scully a photo of Melissa, who is <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> pregnant, shortly before Emily was born, which he thinks proves that she isn't Emily's mother. Scully meets with someone from an adoptive agency, wanting to adopt Emily. The woman is very hesitant considering Scully's job and the fact that Emily is a special needs child. Scully flashes back to talking with Melissa around Christmas time shortly before she joined the FBI. On Christmas morning Scully receives the results of a DNA test from the FBI proving that Melissa is not Emily's mother—she is.|$|E
5|$|Osborn and Mook, in 1921, {{provisionally}} synonymized {{the three}} species, sinking A. latus into Camarasaurus supremus, and suggesting also that A. fragillimus {{is just a}} very large individual of A. altus, a position which most subsequent studies, including McIntosh 1998, Foster (2007), and Woodruff and Foster (2015) have agreed with. Carpenter (2006) disagreed about the synonymy of A. altus and A. fragillimus, however, citing numerous differences {{in the construction of}} the vertebra also noted by Cope, and suggested these differences are enough to warrant a separate species or even a separate genus for A. fragillimus. However, he went on to caution that the validity of A. fragillimus as a separate species is nearly impossible to determine without the original specimen to study. Although Amphicoelias latus is <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> Amphicoelias, it is probably synonymous with Camarasaurus grandis rather than C. supremus because it was found lower in the Morrison Formation and the deeply concave articular faces on the caudal vertebrae are more consistent with C. grandis.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} {{critical}} review of contemporary sources doesn't require a supposed typo in 1771 {{to explain this}} shorter measurement for the mizzen whilst {{at the same time}} offers supporting evidence of its cap being at the taller supposed normal height. Sydney Parkinson's sketches and paintings of Cooks Bark Endeavour along with the 1771 Woolwich Yard Bark Endeavour spar measurements National Maritime Museum in Greenwich NMM ZAZ6594, and other contemporary sources suggest that the shorter mizzen mast was not stepped in the hold/keelson, but instead was stepped in the lower deck 10ft above this as was sometimes done. This would bring its standing height at the cap to within a supposed normal height of around 8– 9ft below the main mast cap and approx 5.5ft below the foremast cap when comparing the heights of the standing mast tops (excludes top and gallant masts) from the level of the water line. Whereas the shorter mizzen stepped in the hold on the keelson instead of the lower deck would make the standing mizzen cap 18ft below the main mast cap which is <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> the case when critically examining Sydney Parkinson's drawings and the contemporary painting titled HMS Endeavour off the coast of New Holland, by Samuel Atkins c. 1794 {{at the top of this}} page. Zooming this painting also reveals that the position of the mizzen channel is forward to inline with the mast which it is when looking at the angle of the mizzen chainplates on the original as fitted draught NMM ZAZ7844. Using these mizzen chainplate angles from this as fitted draught it is possible to extrapolate where the top of the standing mast could be and combined with the similar shroud angles Sydney Parkinson drew in his sketch of the larboard quarter of Endeavour support this theory of the shorter standing mizzen stepped in the lower deck which would make its standing cap 10 foot higher than if stepped in the hold.|$|E
