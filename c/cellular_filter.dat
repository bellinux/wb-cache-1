This <b>cellular</b> <b>filter,</b> separating {{the central nervous system}} from the circulatory system, normally prevents larger molecules from entering the brain. A variety of reasons for such a collapse in integrity have been suggested, with the most likely answer being the effects of acute inflammation of the nervous system. Likewise, the involvement of corticotropin releasing hormone on mast cells in acute stress has been shown to facilitate BBB penetration. However, {{it is also possible that}} the autonomic dysfunction manifested in many patients during the later phases of the condition aids antibody entry. For example, an increase in blood pressure would force larger proteins, such as antibodies, to extravasate into the cerebrospinal fluid.|$|E

These cellular filters, based {{on a combination of}} reducing and augmenting kernels operating on a series of thresholded images, are derived empirically and have fixed characteristics. This thesis presents a method for synthesising 2 dimensional grey level image filters using cellular automata. This method takes as its starting point the characteristic equation of a filter expressed in the Laplace domain, and derives from this equation the kernel of the <b>cellular</b> <b>filter</b> which has the same characteristics as the filter defined by the Laplacian equation. The advantage of using 2 ̆ 7 cellular automata for image filtering is that they are highly parallel in nature, and as such, are a natural algorithm for image filtering on a parallel computational engine...|$|E
40|$|From {{bacteria}} to humans, individual cells within isogenic populations can show significant variation in stress tolerance, but {{the nature of}} this heterogeneity is not clear. To investigate this, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to quantify transcript heterogeneity in single Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells treated with and without salt stress to explore population variation and identify cellular covariates that influence the stress-responsive transcriptome. Leveraging the extensive knowledge of yeast transcriptional regulation, we uncovered significant regulatory variation in individual yeast cells, both before and after stress. We also discovered that a subset of cells appears to decouple expression of ribosomal protein genes from the environmental stress response in a manner partly correlated with the cell cycle but unrelated to the yeast ultradian metabolic cycle. Live-cell imaging of cells expressing pairs of fluorescent regulators, including the transcription factor Msn 2 with Dot 6, Sfp 1, or MAP kinase Hog 1, revealed both coordinated and decoupled nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Together with transcriptomic analysis, our results suggest that cells maintain a <b>cellular</b> <b>filter</b> against decoupled bursts of transcription factor activation but mount a stress response upon coordinated regulation, even in a subset of unstressed cells...|$|E

Besides, one of our principles is to generate random sequences on the GPU since NVIDIA SDK Mersenne Twister proved to be insufficient at low numbers.

40|$|International audienceThis work {{presents}} a novel spatio-temporal <b>cellular</b> automata-based <b>filtering</b> (STCAF) for image sequence denoising. Most {{of the methods}} using cellular automata (CA) for image denoising involve the manual design of the rules that define the behaviour of the automata. This is a complex and not straightforward operation. In order to tackle this problem, this paper proposes to use evolutionary methods to obtain the CA set of rules which produces the best possible denoising under different noise models or/and image sources. This is implemented using a spatio-temporal neighbourhood for each pixel, which significantly improves the results with respect to simple spatio or temporal set of neighbours. The proposed method is tested to reduce the noise in low-dose X-ray image sequences. These data have a severe signal-dependent noise that must be reduced avoiding artifacts while preserving structures of interest for a medical inspection.

30|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a modified <b>cellular</b> particle <b>filter</b> (CPF) which we mapped on a {{graphics processing unit}} (GPU) architecture. We developed this filter adaptation using a state-of-the art CPF technique. Mapping this filter realization on a highly parallel architecture entailed {{a shift in the}} logical representation of the particles. In this process, the original two-dimensional organization is reordered as a one-dimensional ring topology. We proposed a proof-of-concept measurement on two models with an NVIDIA Fermi architecture GPU. This design achieved a 411 - μ s kernel time per state and a 77 -ms global running time for all states for 16, 384 particles with a 256 neighbourhood size on a sequence of 24 states for a bearing-only tracking model. For a commonly used benchmark model at the same configuration, we achieved a 266 - μ s kernel time per state and a 124 -ms global running time for all 100 states. Kernel time includes random number generation on the GPU with curand. These results attest to the effective and fast use of the particle filter in high-dimensional, real-time applications.|$|R

The decisional states form a partition of the lower-level causal states that is defined according to the higher-level user's knowledge.

The framework has four parts: the learning stage, image feature extraction, training filter creation, and filter selection training. Two prototypes systems of this framework are given. The learning stage for these systems is the Berkeley Segmentation Database coupled with the Baddelay Delta Metric. Feature extraction is performed using a GIST methodology which extracts color, intensity, and orientation information. The set of image features are used as the input to a single hidden layer feed forward neural network trained using back propagation. The system trains against a set of linear <b>cellular</b> automata <b>filters</b> which are determined to best solve the edge image according to the Baddelay Delta Metric.

Transport {{plays a key}} role in the survival of networks – for example the specialized signaling cascades of <b>cellular</b> networks <b>filter</b> noise and efficiently adapt the network structure to new stimuli. However, our general understanding of transport mechanisms and signaling pathways in complex systems is yet limited. Here we summarize the key network structures involved in transport, list the solutions available to overloaded systems for relaxing their load and outline a possible method for the computational determination of signaling pathways. We highlight that in addition to hubs, bridges and the network skeleton, the overlapping modular structure is also essential in network transport. Path-lenghts in the module-space of the yeast protein-protein interaction network indicated that module-based paths may cross fewer modular boundaries than shortest paths. Moreover, by locating network elements in the space of overlapping network modules and evaluating their distance in this ‘module space’, it may be possible to approximate signaling pathways computationally, which, in turn could serve the identification of signaling pathways of complex systems.

40|$|Abstract — In modern {{communication}} systems, filtering is {{the most}} widespread and extremely important signal processing technology. FIR filters {{form the basis of}} wireless systems in medical devices, industrial control, consumer electronics, and <b>cellular</b> infrastructure. A <b>filter</b> network selectively changes the wave-shape of a signal in a desired approach. The most common filtering purpose is to remove the noise from the signal. The FIR filters are of finite transient duration, more stable, efficiently realisable and providing exact linear phase as compared to IIR filters. FIR filter structure can be used to realize almost any sort of frequency response digitally. FIR filters are invariably used in the situation where linear phase characteristics within the passband of the filter is required. In this paper, implementation and simulation of 1 -D and 2 -D FIR filters is presented in the MATLAB and Simulink environment.

40|$|The NS 5 B protein of the {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (S. -E. Behrens, L. Tomei, and R. De Francesco, EMBO J. 15 : 12 – 22, 1996) that {{is assumed}} to be required for replication of the viral genome. To further study the biochemical and structural properties of this enzyme, an NS 5 B-hexahistidine fusion protein was expressed with recombinant baculoviruses in insect cells and purified to near homogeneity. The enzyme was found to have a primer-dependent RdRp activity that was able to copy a complete in vitro-transcribed HCV genome in the absence of additional viral or <b>cellular</b> factors. <b>Filter</b> binding assays and competition experiments showed that the purified enzyme binds RNA with no clear preference for HCV 3 *-end sequences.

An inverse order was found for the RdRp activity, which used poly(C) most efficiently as a template but was inactive on poly(U) and poly(G), suggesting that a high binding affinity between polymerase and template interferes with processivity. By using a mutational analysis, four amino acid sequence motifs crucial for RdRp activity were identified. While most substitutions of conserved residues within these motifs severely reduced the enzymatic activities, a single substitution in motif D which enhanced the RdRp activity by about 50 % was found.

40|$|Problem statement: Diesel {{particulate}} {{filters are}} fast becoming integral parts of diesel engines, light and heavy duty, {{due to their}} potential in the reduction of particulate matter from exhaust gases and their noise muffling property. Consequently, several researchers are developing mathematical models {{for the study of}} fluid flow through the filter substrate and in the aiding of filter systems design. Recently, some researchers developed a mathematical model known as the Multiple Orifice Mathematical (MOM) model for determining pressure gradients of gelcast ceramic foams. The MOM model was calibrated using fluid flow data from <b>cellular</b> foam <b>filter</b> structure similar to ceramic foams. However, there was need to improve on the method of calibrating the model. Approach: Following the conceptual model employed {{in the development of the}} MOM model, a physical scale model was designed using a CAD package and manufactured for the purpose of measuring pressure drops across the connecting windows of the cells. A new fluid flow rig was also designed from a CAD package and fabricated to adapt to the physical scale model. Applying the conservation theory, the flow rates across the windows were calculated and equated to the flow rate determined from an orifice meter, where the correction coefficients for the calibration of the MOM model were calculated. Results: A number of correction coefficients were calculated from the data collected from the experimental rig. The average correction coefficient which was used for the calibration of the MOM model was found to be 2. 24. Conclusion/Recommendations: The result obtained from the new method of model calibration corroborated the value determined by earlier researchers. This new method reduced the computational time of calibrating the MOM model and eliminates the use of graphs and graph fitting.

40|$|It {{has been}} well {{established}} that modulating serotonin (5 -HT) levels in humans and animals affects perception and response to social threats, however the circuit mechanisms that control 5 -HT output during social interaction are not well understood. A better understanding of these systems could provide groundwork for more precise and efficient therapeutic interventions. Here we examined the organization and plasticity of microcircuits implicated in top-down control of 5 -HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) by excitatory inputs from the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and their role in social approach-avoidance decisions. We did this {{in the context of}} a social defeat model that induces a long lasting form of social aversion that is reversible by antidepressants. We first used viral tracing and Cre-dependent genetic identification of vmPFC glutamatergic synapses in the DRN to determine their topographic distribution in relation to 5 -HT and GABAergic subregions and found that excitatory vmPFC projections primarily localized to GABA-rich areas of the DRN. We then used optogenetics in combination with cFos mapping and slice electrophysiology to establish the functional effects of repeatedly driving vmPFC inputs in DRN. We provide the first direct evidence that vmPFC axons drive synaptic activity and immediate early gene expression in genetically identified DRN GABA neurons through an AMPA receptor-dependent mechanism. In contrast, we did not detect vmPFC-driven synaptic activity in 5 -HT neurons and cFos induction in 5 -HT neurons was limited. Finally we show that optogenetically increasing or decreasing excitatory vmPFC input to the DRN during sensory exposure to an aggressor’s cues enhances or diminishes avoidance bias, respectively. These results clarify the functional organization of vmPFC-DRN pathways and identify GABAergic neurons as a key <b>cellular</b> element <b>filtering</b> top-down vmPFC influences on affect-regulating 5 -HT output...|$|R
40|$|Information {{transmission}} {{in biological}} signaling circuits {{has often been}} described using the metaphor of a noise <b>filter.</b> <b>Cellular</b> systems need accurate, real-time data about their environmental conditions, but the biochemical reaction networks that propagate, amplify, and process signals work with noisy representations of that data. Biology must implement strategies that not only filter the noise, but also predict {{the current state of}} the environment based on information delayed due to the finite speed of chemical signaling. The idea of a biochemical noise filter is actually more than just a metaphor: we describe recent work that has made an explicit mathematical connection between signaling fidelity in cellular circuits and the classic theories of optimal noise filtering and prediction that began with Wiener, Kolmogorov, Shannon, and Bode. This theoretical framework provides a versatile tool, allowing us to derive analytical bounds on the maximum mutual information between the environmental signal and the real-time estimate constructed by the system. It helps us understand how the structure of a biological network, and the response times of its components, influences the accuracy of that estimate.

40|$|Measurement of {{infrequent}} DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) in mammalian {{cells is}} essential for the understanding of cell damage by ionizing radiation and many DNA-reactive drugs. One of the most important assays for measuring DSB in <b>cellular</b> DNA is <b>filter</b> elution. This study is an attempt to determine whether standard concepts of fluid mechanics can yield a self-consistent model of this process. Major assumptions of the analysis are reptation through a channel formed by surrounding strands, with only strand ends captured by filter pores. Both viscosity and entanglement with surrounding strands are considered to determine the resistance to this motion. One important result is that the average elution time of a strand depends not only on its length, but also on the size distribution of the surrounding strands. This model is consistent with experimental observations, such as the dependence of elution kinetics upon radiation dose, but independence from the size of the DNA sample up to a critical filter loading, and possible overlap of elution times for strands of different length. It indicates how the dependence of elution time on the flow rate could reveal the relative importance of viscous and entanglement resistance, and also predicts the consequences of using different filters...|$|R

However, {{the interpretation of the}} numerous sequence variants identified remains challenging. We assessed the application of exome sequencing for diagnostics in complex I deficiency, a disease with vast genetic heterogeneity. METHODS: Ten unrelated individuals with complex I deficiency were selected for exome sequencing and sequential bioinformatic <b>filtering.</b> <b>Cellular</b> rescue experiments were performed to verify pathogenicity of novel disease alleles. RESULTS: The first filter criterion was 'Presence of known pathogenic complex I deficiency variants'. This revealed homozygous mutations in NDUFS 3 and ACAD 9 in two individuals. A second criterion was 'Presence of two novel potentially pathogenic variants in a structural gene of complex I', which discovered rare variants in NDUFS 8 in two unrelated individuals and in NDUFB 3 in a third. Expression of wild-type cDNA in mutant cell lines rescued complex I activity and assembly, thus providing a functional validation of their pathogenicity. Using the third criterion 'Presence of two potentially pathogenic variants in a gene encoding a mitochondrial protein', loss-of-function mutations in MTFMT were discovered in two patients. In three patients the molecular genetic correlate remained unclear and follow-up analysis is ongoing.
