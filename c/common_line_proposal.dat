40|$|The single-particle {{reconstruction}} {{problem of}} electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) {{is to find}} the three-dimensional structure of a macromolecule given its two-dimensional noisy projection images at unknown random directions. Ab initio estimates of the 3 D structure are often obtained by the “Angular Reconstitution ” method, in which a coordinate system is established from three projections, and the orientation of the particle giving rise to each image is deduced from <b>common</b> <b>lines</b> among the images.

50|$|If two bounded {{connected}} planar shapes have disjoint convex hulls {{that are}} separated by a positive distance, then they necessarily have exactly four <b>common</b> <b>lines</b> of support, the bitangents of the two convex hulls. Two of these lines of support separate the two shapes, and are called critical support lines. Otherwise {{there may be more}} or fewer than four lines of support, even if the shapes themselves are disjoint. For instance, if one shape is an annulus that contains the other, then there are no <b>common</b> <b>lines</b> of support, while if each of two shapes consists of a pair of small disks at opposite corners of a square then there may be as many as 16 <b>common</b> <b>lines</b> of support.|$|R

A robust computation method of <b>common</b> <b>lines</b> in the real space using aweighted cross-correlation function is proposed to increase the robustness of the algorithm against the noise. A small number of good leading images, which have the maximal dissimilarity, are used to increase the reliability of orientations and improve the efficiency for determining the orientations of all the images.
