The mpanombily comprised many noble clans such as the Anakara, Onjatsy, Tsimaito, Antaiony, Antalaotra, Antaisambo, Antaimahazo and others. Particular clans within Antemoro society historically held distinct privileges and responsibilities. The butchering of certain animals for human consumption was assigned to specific clans.|$|E
5|$|As {{the main}} war effort of Greece was {{initially}} turned towards Macedonia, on the Epirus front the Greek army was outnumbered by the Ottoman Yanya Corps at {{the outbreak of}} hostilities in October 1912. After stopping an initial attack by the Ottoman commander Esat Pasha at Gribovo, however, the Greeks succeeded in liberating Preveza (October 21) and pushing north {{in the direction of}} Ioannina, repulsing an Ottoman attack at Pente Pigadia (Beshpinar). On November 5, a small force from Corfu made a landing and captured the <b>coastal</b> <b>area</b> of Himarë without facing significant resistance, and on December 20 Greek troops improved their positions in Epirus and entered Korçë, north of Ioannina, thus cutting off its last supply route and threatening the city's northeastern flank.|$|E
5|$|Australian {{fears of}} a Japanese {{counter-attack}} grew and they requested reinforcements from General Douglas MacArthur. The request was denied as his intelligence staff believed that there were only 350 Japanese in the vicinity. Actually, there were already 5,000 Japanese around Sattelberg and Finschhafen. The Australians received some reinforcements {{in the shape of}} the 2/43rd Infantry Battalion. The arrival of this unit meant that the entire 20th Infantry Brigade could concentrate on Finschhafen. The Japanese naval troops which were holding Finschhafen began to withdraw and Finschhafen fell to the Australians on 2 October. The 20th Infantry Brigade then linked up with the 22nd Infantry Battalion, a Militia infantry battalion that had cleared the <b>coastal</b> <b>area</b> in the south of the Huon Peninsula, advancing from Lae over the mountains. The Japanese withdrew into the mountains around Sattelberg.|$|E

In order to mitigate natural disasters, it is important to map and understand underground features in <b>coastal</b> <b>areas,</b> because liquefaction caused by earthquakes depends on geological settings (Hallier et al., 2008), tsunami generation is, to some extent, associated with underwater landslides caused by the instability of sediments (Tinti et al., 2006), and hurricanes are major factors which erode, transport and redeposit sediments in <b>coastal</b> <b>areas</b> (Miner et al., 2009).|$|R

5|$|Intense {{tropical}} cyclones pose {{a particular}} observation challenge, {{as they are}} a dangerous oceanic phenomenon, and weather stations, being relatively sparse, are rarely available {{on the site of}} the storm itself. In general, surface observations are available only if the storm is passing over an island or a <b>coastal</b> <b>area,</b> or if there is a nearby ship. Real-time measurements are usually taken in the periphery of the cyclone, where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be evaluated. For this reason, there are teams of meteorologists that move into the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate their strength at the point of landfall.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{formation}} of the storm, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm watch for the <b>coastal</b> <b>area</b> between Pascagoula, Mississippi and the Suwannee River in Florida. A tropical storm warning for the region between Grand Isle, Louisiana and Apalachicola, Florida replaced the watch, though it was discontinued east of Apalachicola. All tropical cyclone warnings and watches were discontinued by 1800 UTC on September14, as there was no longer a need for the advisories. After the landfall, officials issued flood watches for inland parts of Mississippi and Alabama as well as for western portions of Georgia and the Carolinas. On Dauphin Island in Alabama, some residents boarded up windows and filled sandbags provided by local fire departments to prepare for Hanna. The Red Cross opened 10 shelters throughout the Gulf Coast region.|$|E

5|$|After {{an attack}} across the Ilebbe Creek by the 2/13th Infantry Battalion, which cost the Australians 80casualties on 1 October, the Japanese naval troops which were holding Finschhafen began to withdraw. On 2 October, the town {{fell to the}} Australians and the Japanese {{abandoned}} the Kakakog Ridge amidst heavy Australian air and artillery attacks. Once the 20th Brigade was established in Finschhafen, it linked up with the 22nd Infantry Battalion, a Militia infantry battalion. This unit had cleared the <b>coastal</b> <b>area</b> {{in the south of}} the peninsula, advancing from Lae over the mountains. Meanwhile, the Japanese that had been around Finschhafen withdrew back into the mountains around Sattelberg. Allied air operations from the airfield at Finschhafen commenced on 4 October.

5|$|After {{the death}} of Tapps in 1835, his son Sir George William Tapps-Gervis {{inherited}} his father's estate. He hired the young local architect Benjamin Ferrey to develop the <b>coastal</b> <b>area</b> {{on the east side}} of the stream. Bournemouth's first hotel, later to become part of the Royal Bath Hotel, opened in 1838 and is one of the few buildings designed by Ferrey still standing. Bournemouth started to grow at a faster rate as Tapps-Gervis began developing the area similarly to the south coast resorts of Weymouth and Brighton. Despite enormous investment, the town's share of the market remained modest. In 1841 Tapps-Gervis invited the physician and writer Augustus Granville to stay. Granville was the author of The Spas of England, which described health resorts around the country, and as a result of his visit he included a chapter on Bournemouth in the second edition of his book. The publication of the book, and the increase in visitors seeking the medicinal use of seawater and the pine-scented air, helped the town to grow and establish itself as an early tourist destination.|$|E
40|$|Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) {{was used}} to analyse the {{physical}} vulnerability to coastal disaster of the <b>coastal</b> <b>areas</b> of Makassar City. CVI will consider six variables namely geology, geomorphology, erosion and accretion, tidal range, average wave height and elevation. Geologically, <b>coastal</b> <b>areas</b> of Makassar comprise sand, gravel, clay and coral limestone. Geomorphologically, alluvial plain, sandy to gravelly beaches are predominant in the <b>coastal</b> <b>areas.</b> Both erosion and accretion occurred in the <b>coastal</b> <b>areas</b> in which accretion predominantly found {{in the southern part}} whereas erosion {{in the northern part of}} the city. Using DigitalElevation Model it can be observed that the elevation of the <b>coastal</b> <b>areas</b> of Makassar City is between 0 – 0. 5 meter which is very vulnerable to sea level rise. Average tidal range was between 1. 1 to 2 meter and wave height between 0 to 2. 9 meter. CVI analyses showed that the <b>coastal</b> <b>areas</b> of Makassar City is vulnerable to sea level rise and hence to the coastal disaster.
