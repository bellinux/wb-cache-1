5|$|In the 1970s, Roy McBride, {{a farmer}} from Alpine, Texas, invented a collar {{filled with the}} poison {{compound}} 1080 to protect his livestock from coyotes, which tended to attack the throat. This device {{is known as the}} livestock protection <b>collar</b> <b>and</b> is in widespread use in Texas, as well as in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Many {{allopatric}} forms previously {{regarded as}} conspecific are treated by Rasmussen and Anderton as full species. Most of these {{had previously been}} proposed elsewhere, but the book introduced a number of innovations of its own. Experts on Asian birds, Nigel <b>Collar</b> <b>and</b> John Pilgrim, in 2008 analysed Rasmussen and Anderton's proposed changes, indicating which had previously been proposed by other authors, and which were novel, and required further justification.|$|E
5|$|During a later court {{session on}} September 9, Takaesu {{attempted}} to submit medical evidence that Brown {{had suffered a}} back injury in 1999 and had a steel <b>collar</b> <b>and</b> bolts inserted around his spine. According to Brown, these injuries {{made it impossible to}} for him to assault V. N. as described in the police report. The Naha court panel of three judges agreed to issue a decision as to whether the evidence was submissable at a later date.|$|E
50|$|Larvae develop {{through six}} stages. Newly hatched larvae are yellow-green with brown heads. In {{the next three}} stages, larvae have black heads <b>and</b> <b>collars</b> <b>and</b> orange- or cinnamon-brown bodies. In the fifth stage, larvae have reddish-brown heads marked with black triangles, black <b>collars,</b> <b>and</b> pale olive-brown bodies marked with small whitish spots. Mature larvae are 1 to 11/4 inches (25 to 32 mm) long, with tan or light chestnut-brown heads <b>and</b> <b>collars</b> <b>and</b> olive- or reddish-brown bodies with large ivory-colored areas.|$|R

5|$|In 1895, a dozen Maine Coons {{were entered}} into a show in Boston. On 8 May 1895, the first North American cat show was hosted at Madison Square Garden in New York City. A female Maine Coon brown tabby, named Cosey, was entered into the show. Owned by Mrs. Fred Brown, Cosey won the silver <b>collar</b> <b>and</b> medal and was named Best in Show. The silver collar was {{purchased}} by the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) Foundation {{with the help of}} a donation from the National Capital Cat Show. The collar is housed at the CFA Central Office in the Jean Baker Rose Memorial Library.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Pamela C. Rasmussen {{granted the}} taxon {{autonomous}} status in her book, Birds of South Asia. The Ripley Guide, uncoupling the species from S. leucopsis. The classification was noted by ornithologists Nigel J. <b>Collar</b> <b>and</b> John D. Pilgrim in 2007, and {{endorsed by the}} International Ornithological Congress, by Alan P. Peterson in his well-known Zoological Nomenclature Resource (Zoonomen), and by the Internet Bird Collection (IBC), sponsored by the Handbook of the Birds of the World. No subspecies of S. przewalskii itself have been identified.|$|E

The badge is depicted suspended from the collar. The Royal Arms depict the <b>collar</b> <b>and</b> motto of the Order of the Thistle only in Scotland; they show the circlet and motto of the Garter in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.|$|E

50|$|The colour {{scheme for}} the drones {{used in the}} second film is {{essentially}} the same as that used for the television versions at the time, being silver with grey shoulders, natural aluminium <b>collars</b> <b>and</b> slats, blue hemispheres and a black fender. The narrative fails to establish a precise hierarchy for the Dalek commanders seen in the film. The leader of the expeditionary force appears to be a gold Dalek with natural aluminium <b>collars</b> <b>and</b> slats, black hemispheres and a black fender. A black Dalek with gold hemispheres, natural aluminium <b>collars</b> <b>and</b> slats and a black fender is in charge of a mining operation in Bedfordshire, while a red Dalek with natural aluminium <b>collars</b> <b>and</b> slats and a black fender with red topping is shown commanding a Dalek spaceship and operations to capture human slaves and wipe-out the resistance. Drones sport blue dome lights, the black and red Daleks have red dome lights and the gold Dalek has yellow dome lights. As for the first film, the Dalek props were constructed by Shawcraft Engineering.|$|R

5|$|New {{home and}} away kits were brought in {{for the first time}} in two years. The home kit {{included}} red shirts with a white <b>collar</b> <b>and</b> white trims on the sleeves, white shorts and red socks. The away kit comprised light blue shirts with a white collar, a white double-chevron decoration at the top and white sleeves, light blue shirts and light blue socks. Benenden Health continued as shirt sponsors for the third successive season.|$|E
5|$|The Command Module Columbia was {{displayed}} at the National Air and Space Museum (NASM), Washington, D.C. It was in the central Milestones of Flight exhibition hall {{in front of the}} Jefferson Drive entrance, sharing the main hall with other pioneering flight vehicles such as the Wright Flyer, the Spirit of St. Louis, the Bell X-1, the North American X-15, Mercury spacecraft Friendship 7, and Gemini 4. Armstrong's and Aldrin's space suits are displayed in the museum's Apollo to the Moon exhibit. The quarantine trailer, the flotation <b>collar,</b> <b>and</b> the righting spheres are displayed at the Smithsonian's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center annex near Washington Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The {{juvenile}} pied butcherbird has {{dark brown}} instead of black plumage, lacks the pale <b>collar</b> <b>and</b> has a cream to buff lores, chin, and upper throat, becoming more brown {{on the lower}} throat and breast. Its underparts are off-white to cream. The bill is dark brown. In its first year, it moults into its first immature plumage, which resembles that of the juvenile, but has a more extensive dark brown throat. Its bill is blue-grey with a dark brown or blackish tip.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Washington, D.C., Scully attends a performance hearing, after {{which she is}} transferred. Mulder is devastated to lose his partner. The two are about to share a kiss when Scully is stung by a bee which had lodged itself under her shirt <b>collar,</b> <b>and</b> she quickly loses consciousness. Mulder calls paramedics, but {{the driver of the}} ambulance shoots Mulder and whisks Scully away. Mulder, not severely injured, slips out of hospital with the help of The Lone Gunmen and FBI Assistant Director Walter Skinner. He then meets a former adversary, the Well-Manicured Man, who gives him Scully's location, along with a vaccine against the virus that has infected her. As Mulder leaves, the Well-Manicured Man kills himself in a car bomb, before his betrayal of The Syndicate is discovered.|$|E
5|$|Since 1958, the Cup has {{undergone}} several minor alterations. The original <b>collar</b> <b>and</b> bowl were too brittle, and were replaced in 1963 and 1969, respectively. The modern one-piece Cup design {{was introduced in}} 1958, when the old barrel was replaced with a five-band barrel, each of which could contain 13 winning teams. Although the bands were originally designed to fill up during the Cup's centennial year, {{the names of the}} 1965 Montreal Canadiens were engraved over a larger area than allotted and thus there are 12 teams on that band instead of 13. When the bands were all filled in 1991, the top band of the large barrel was preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame, and a new blank band was added to the bottom so the Stanley Cup would not grow further.|$|E
5|$|Since the 2013–14 season, Partick Thistle's kits {{have been}} {{manufactured}} by Joma Sports. During the 2014–15 season, Partick Thistle supported the Breast Cancer Care Charity by {{wearing a black}} and pink away shirt, with the charity ribbon on the shirt. The partnership saw a portion of kit sale revenue being donated to Breast Cancer Care. Partick Thistle's current home kit features a yellow and red shirt, the sleeves are yellow with a predominanty red foreground. The kit features black shorts, red socks, with a yellow trim. The away kit is white, with a yellow <b>collar</b> <b>and</b> sleeve trim on the jersey. Goalkeepers wear a generic kit design from Joma, and are either pink or grey.|$|E

5|$|The average horse {{can carry}} up to {{approximately}} 30% {{of its body}} weight. While all horses can pull more than they can carry, the weight horses can pull varies widely, depending on the build of the horse, the type of vehicle, road conditions, and other factors. Horses harnessed to a wheeled vehicle on a paved road can pull as much as eight times their weight, but far less if pulling wheelless loads over unpaved terrain. Thus, horses that were driven varied in size and {{had to make a}} trade-off between speed and weight, just as did riding animals. Light horses could pull a small war chariot at speed. Heavy supply wagons, artillery, and support vehicles were pulled by heavier horses or a larger number of horses. The method by which a horse was hitched to a vehicle also mattered: horses could pull greater weight with a horse collar than they could with a breast <b>collar,</b> <b>and</b> even less with an ox yoke.|$|E
5|$|The club {{eventually}} {{chose the}} colours {{of the local}} Parramatta council, which were royal blue and gold, which were represented on their jersey in horizontal stripes, or hoops. The crest used these colours and was {{like many of the}} other crests of the 1908 season, a badge with a letter 'C', to represent the first letter of Cumberland. The badge was royal blue, while the letter gold. These colours were later used by the Parramatta Eels at their introduction in the NSWRL premiership in 1947, although there was no official affiliation between Cumberland and the later Parramatta team. The club's jersey was, like most other clubs, the colours in hoops around the jersey. These hoops of blue and gold were mixed with a white <b>collar</b> <b>and</b> black or grey shorts.|$|E
5|$|The current New Zealand {{jersey is}} entirely black (currently {{referred}} to as the 'blackest' jersey ever created) except the Adidas logo, the NZRU silver fern on the front and the AIG logo in the lower center (all of which are darkened from previously). The 1884 New Zealand tour to Australia was the first overseas New Zealand rugby tour, and featured clothing very different from today's jersey. Back then, the team donned a dark blue jersey, with gold fern on the left of the jumper. In 1893 the NZRU stipulated at its annual general meeting that the uniform would be black jersey with a silver fern and white knickerbockers. However historic photographs suggest white shorts may have been used instead during these early years. Sometime between 1897 and 1901 there was a change; by 1901 the team met NSW in a black jersey, a canvas top with no <b>collar,</b> <b>and</b> a silver fern.|$|E

5|$|The jacket {{prescribed}} for infantry use {{was of the}} same design for all service men. The design itself depended entirely on the region, time, {{and the source of}} fabrics. The Eastern Theater uniform jacket was the Richmond Depot design, with three primary types issued throughout the war. The jacket varied from a cadet gray, piped and trimmed jacket, looking much like a pre-war militia jacket, to the jeans-cloth jacket that was worn out in six months. The materials and uniforms imported from England were also issued to the troops through this facility. The Western and Deep Southern facilities manufactured similar uniforms, being jeans-cloth, dyed with vegetable based grays, that would fade to brown or tan. The typical jackets issued had 5-7 button fronts, with <b>collar</b> <b>and</b> cuff trim that varied from era, region and source, and an outside pocket on occasion.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} is composed in monochrome, muted colours; predominately blacks, greys and browns. The exceptions are {{the whites of}} his <b>collar</b> <b>and</b> sleeves, the reds in the cushion and the light reflecting on the leather of the arm-chair. In 19th-century art, vivid colour was associated with femininity and emotion; male portraiture tended towards muted shades and monochrome. Bertin leans slightly forward, boldly staring at the viewer {{in a manner that}} is both imposing and paternal. He seems engaged, and poised to speak, his body fully towards the viewer and his expression etched with certainty. Influenced by Nicolas Poussin's 1650 Self-Portrait with Allegory of Painting, Ingres minutely details the veins and wrinkles of his face. Bertin is in three-quarter profile, against a gold–brown background lit from the right. He rests on a curved-back mahogany chair, the arms of which reflect light falling from the upper left of the pictorial space.|$|E
5|$|The {{portrait}} {{represents a}} man, estimated {{by some to}} be 45years of age, standing turned to the viewer's right, looking at the viewer with a commanding expression. In his uplifted right hand he holds a baton with a golden cap. He has a thick moustache and wears a high fur cap on which there is a golden chain with precious stones and a coat of arms in the center. From his ear a large pear-shaped pearl hangs from a golden pendant earring. He wears a reddish-brown mantle with a broad fur <b>collar</b> <b>and,</b> over it, a heavy gold chain from which the order of three horse tails, set in rich pendants, hangs on his right shoulder. A full light from the left falls {{on the right side of}} his face. The background is brownish-grey.|$|E
50|$|The uniform {{members of}} the Company wear is {{identical}} to that worn by the HAC in the reign of Charles I. It comprises Venetian red tunics with white linen <b>collars</b> <b>and</b> cuffs and knee-length breeches.
