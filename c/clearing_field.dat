40|$|During {{the course}} of an {{experiment}} on the decay properties of AO particles we observed qualitatively an ionization effect. The sparks of the lihavily ionizing proton were bright and had 100 /o gap efficiency. The sparks of the mifnimuma ionizing pion are weak and have a low gap efficiency. These observations are studied quantitatively in this paper. In the past we have pointed out a circumstance in which the relative efficiency for registration of two tracks in a spark chamber is quite different. 1, 2 We observed the following situation: A spark chamber is operated with a <b>clearing</b> <b>field</b> in a high particle flux. Subsequent to a triggering particle another particle enters the chamber. The <b>clearing</b> <b>field</b> in the meantime has resoved a number of the electrons from the triggering track. Thus {{at the time of the}} high voltage pulse the young track has more electrons and is registered with brighter sparks and more efficiency. In many cases the younger track "eats up " the triggering track. Thus the sharing of the high voltage pulse energy seems to depend on the relative number of initial electrons in the two potential spark columns. The same effect should occur with two simultaneous tracks of different ionization. We have now observed this effect. During a run on the Cosmotron in July 1961 we photograghed many AO particle decays. The A decays to a proton and a pion with relative ionizations (I,I,) ranging frem 4. 4 to 1. 6. The decays were observed in a chamber whose plates were 0. 001 inch aluminum foils. Following the thin foil chamber was a carbon plate which allowed the proton range to be measured in most cases. From the proton range and the AO opening angle it is possible to determine accurately the momenta of both tracks. The effect can be seen qualitatively in Fig. 1. The pion track is much fainter and the gap efficiency l. ...|$|E

40|$|An {{ionization}} profile monitor can collect either ions or electrons produced from residual gas ionization. A magnetic field {{can be used}} to confine the drift path of the electrons, reducing distortion introduced into the clearing electric field by the beam space charge. We have designed, built, measured, and installed in the Fermilab Main Injector a permanent magnet for this purpose. We discuss the requirements for such a magnet, especially the effect of magnetic strength and imperfections on the measured electron profiles, and the performance of the magnet as built. 1 EXISTING INSTRUMENTS The existing Ionization Profile Monitors (IPM) installed in Main Injector collect positive ions utilizing a 30 kV <b>clearing</b> <b>field.</b> These systems have been previously reported [1].

40|$|The {{formation}} of new particles for the ternary system involving sulfuric acid, water vapor and ammonia {{has been studied}} in detail. The nucleation rates were obtained from experiments at the CERN CLOUD chamber which allows the measurement of new particle formation under very well defined conditions. Some of its key features are the suppression of contaminants at the technological limit and a very precise control {{of a wide range}} of temperatures, trace gas concentrations and nucleation rates. The effect of ionizing radiation on the ternary nucleation rates was investigated by using the CERN proton synchrotron beam (beam conditions), natural galactic cosmic rays (gcr conditions) as well as the high voltage <b>clearing</b> <b>field</b> inside the chamber to suppress the effect of charges (neutral conditions). The dependence of the nucleation rate on ion concentration, sulfuric acid and ammonia concentration as well as temperature was studied extensively. This way, an unprecedented set of data was collected giving insight into the role of neutral and charged ternary NH_ 3 nucleation and the relative importance of the different parameters...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} of the characteristics of the current limited spark chamber, in which it was found that certain anomalies existed in its operation. Such discrepancies are not found in the operation of the more conventional types of chamber. They are thought to be due to charge deposited on the dielectric walls producing internal electric fields across the gas which reduce the chamber efficiency. The variation of the <b>clearing</b> <b>field</b> has been investigated in regions far from the discharge, and would appear to be present throughout the chamber. Measurement of the decay constant of the charge agreed well with the value calculated considering the chamber capacity and surface resistivity of the glass, although on application of this constant, to determine equilibrium values of the clearing fields, a second, much longer decay process seemed to be suggested. A theoretical model for handling such small clearing fields has been examined, and applied to the system, thus giving an indication of the electron drift velocity and density of charge deposited on the walls The development of an approximate semiquantitative model of spark breakdown shows how different pulse delays will affect the growth of streamers, and describes qualitatively certain characteristics of the discharges noted during chamber operation. However, the lack of more detailed knowledge of certain discharge parameters does not allow a more detailed comparison...|$|E

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{characteristics}} of neon flash tubes with a view to their use in cosmic ray work, and for machine experiments. In particular their low efficiency when operated at high repetition rates has been investigated, and this is thought to be due to fields set up by charge deposited on the glass {{as a result of the}} discharge. The fields are shown to decay with a time constant consistent with conduction of electrons over the glass surface to neutralise positive ions deposited on the other side of the tube. A long term effect has also been encountered, and is thought to be due to fields caused by electrons trapped in the glass. The discharge laechanism has been examined and shown to be, in most cases, a combination of streamer and Townsend breakdown. The most probable method of propagation down the tube is that several discharges are initiated along the tube by photoemission from the walls caused by photons from the initial and successive avalanches. When the field due to charge separation effectively backs off the applied field, the discharge is quenched. A random walk method has been developed to solve the equation of diffusion and drift for electrons in a flash tube, taking formative distance into account, and hence the fields built up during the experiment have been estimated, and compared with values calculated from the decay constant obtained from the resistivity of the glass and the capacitance of the tube. Some methods of overcoming the <b>clearing</b> <b>field</b> effect, namely increased surface conductivity, and the use of a bipolar ringing pulse, have been successfully tried, with a view to making the efficiency of flash tubes independent of repetition. rate...|$|E
40|$|Ternary aerosol {{nucleation}} {{experiments were}} conducted in the CLOUD chamber at CERN in order to investigate the influence of ions on new particle formation. Neutral and ion-induced nucleation experiments, i. e. without and {{with the presence of}} ions, respectively, were carried out under precisely controlled conditions. The sulfuric acid concentration was measured with a chemical ionisation mass spectrometer (CIMS) during the new particle formation experiments. The added ternary trace gases were ammonia (NH 3), dimethylamine (DMA, $C_ 2 H_ 7 N$) or oxidised products of pinanediol (PD, $C_{ 10 }H_{ 18 }O_ 2 $). When pinanediol was introduced into the chamber, an increase in the mass spectrometric signal used to determine the sulfuric acid concentration (m/z 97, i. e. $HSO_ 4 $−) was observed due to ions from the CLOUD chamber. The enhancement was only observed during ion-induced nucleation measurements by using either galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) or the proton synchrotron (PS) pion beam for the ion generation, respectively. The ion effect typically involved an increase in the apparent sulfuric acid concentration by a factor of ~ 2 to 3 and was qualitatively verified by the ion measurements with an atmospheric-pressure interface-time of flight (APi-TOF) mass spectrometer. By applying a high-voltage (HV) <b>clearing</b> <b>field</b> inside the CLOUD chamber, the ion effect on the CIMS measurement was completely eliminated since, under these conditions, small ions are swept from the chamber in about 1 s. In order to exclude the ion effect and to provide corrected sulfuric acid concentrations during the GCR and PS beam nucleation experiments, a parameterisation was derived that utilises the trace gas concentrations and the UV light intensity as input parameters. Atmospheric sulfuric acid measurements with a CIMS showed an insignificant ion effect...|$|E
