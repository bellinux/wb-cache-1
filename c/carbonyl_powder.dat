Coarse water atomised powder particles promoted reactive sintering, and coarse porosity was found due to the coalescence of Kirkendall porosity and by the pores generated during the exothermic reaction between Ti and Fe. The addition of Fe- 25 Ti produced brittle materials, as its low purity (91 · 5 %) was found to be unsuitable for formulating Ti alloysThe authors would like to acknowledge financial support from the Comunidad de Madrid to carry out this research through the programme ESTRUMAT-CM (reference MAT/ 77), and from the Ministry of Education through the R&D Project MAT 2006 - 02458.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the feasibility of two detection methods for use in discrimination and sorting of adult Atlantic cod (about 2 kg) in the small scale capture-based aquaculture (CBA). Presently, there is no established method for discrimination of weaned and unweaned cod in CBA. Generally, 60 - 70 % of the wild-caught cod in the CBA are weaned into commercial dry feed. To increase profitability for the fish farmers, unweaned cod must be separated from the stock, meaning the fish must be sorted into two groups - unweaned and weaned from moist feed. The challenges with handling of large numbers of fish in cages, defined the limits of the applied technology. As a result, a working model was established, focusing on implementing different marking materials added to the fish feed, and different technology for detecting the feed presence in the fish gut. X-ray imaging in two modes (planar and dual energy band) and sensitive radio-frequency metal detection were the detection methods that were chosen for the investigations. Both methods were tested in laboratory conditions using dead fish with marked feed inserted into the gut cavity. In particular, the sensitive radio-frequency metal detection method with <b>carbonyl</b> <b>powder</b> showed very promising results in detection of marked feed. Results show also that Dual energy band X-ray imaging may have potential for prediction of fat content in the feed. Based on the investigations it can be concluded that both X-ray imaging and sensitive radio-frequency metal detector technology have the potential for detecting cod having consumed marked feed. These are all technologies that may be adapted to large scale handling of fish from fish cages. Thus, it may be possible to discriminate between unweaned and weaned cod in a large scale grading situation. Based on the results of this study, a suggestion for evaluation of concept for in-situ sorting system is presented...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{fabricate}} an anisotropic magnetorheological elastomer (MREs) based on natural rubber (NR) that has a more advanced MR effect than isotropic MREs by using an anisotropic mold. We evaluated variation in the shear modulus of the MREs in the frequency domain under a magnetic field with a continuously-variable induced current. An evaluation system is proposed that includes a magnetic flux generator, which generates a magnetic field via a continuously-variable induced current. One of the anisotropic MREs possessing 30 vol. %, 40 vol. %, and 50 vol. % <b>carbonyl</b> iron <b>powder</b> was expected to have the highest shear modulus variation as a function of the variable induced current. With the evaluation system, we identified the variation and maximum variation rate of the shear modulus of MREs with three different volume fractions of <b>carbonyl</b> iron <b>powder</b> (CIP) and continuously-variable induced current. The magnetic flux density generated by the magnetic flux generator (MFG) is optimized by electromagnetic finite element method (FEM) analysis and response surface method techniques. The values of each design factor determined by the response surface method (RSM) were applied to the redesign of the evaluation system, including the MFG. The proposed system is verified for the range in which MFG can generate magnetic flux density in order to determine the existence of magnetic saturation of the MFG by magnetic circuit analysis. Consequently, the appropriate volume fraction of CIP in MREs without inducing currents can be determined for any desired shear modulus. The desired volume fraction of CIP in the anisotropic MREs can be approximated to achieve an appropriate shear modulus variation rate. This study demonstrates that it is possible to obtain an appropriate volume fraction of CIP and induced current to achieve the desired shear modulus variation rate of an anisotropic MRE.
