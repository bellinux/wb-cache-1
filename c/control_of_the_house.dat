5|$|John Boehner, {{a member}} of the Republican Party from Ohio, served as the Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives from February 2006 until January 2007. As the Democratic Party assumed <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> {{following}} the 2006 elections, Boehner served as Minority Leader from January 2007 until January 2011. When Republicans reassumed <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives in January 2011, Boehner was elected as Speaker, with the votes of all 241 of his fellow Republicans. In 2014, some House Republicans reached out to Ben Carson about his interest in becoming Speaker should they be able to oust Boehner; Carson declined, citing his impending candidacy for president. Boehner's Republican opponents formed a congressional caucus, called the Freedom Caucus, in January 2015 to focus their opposition. Though Boehner was reelected as Speaker {{at the beginning of the}} 114th United States Congress that month, 25 conservative members of the Republican caucus did not vote for him. Daniel Webster, a Republican from Florida, received 12 votes.|$|E

In 1996, he defeated State Senator and future Lieutenant and Acting Governor Jane Swift by a 53% to 47% margin. After 1996, Olver continually won re-election with high margins above 60%.|$|E

5|$|Randall's {{defense of}} smaller, less {{centralized}} government raised his profile among House Democrats, and they elevated him to Speaker in 1876. He held that post until the Democrats lost <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> in 1881, {{and was considered}} a possible nominee for President in 1880 and 1884. Randall's support for high tariffs began to alienate him from most Democrats, and when that party regained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> in 1883, he was denied another term as Speaker. Randall continued to serve in Congress {{as head of the}} Appropriations Committee. He remained a respected party leader, but gradually lost influence as the Democrats became more firmly wedded to free trade. Worsening health also curtailed his power until his death in 1890.|$|E
5|$|During the 1910 midterm {{election}} campaign, Roosevelt involved himself in New York politics, while Taft with donations and influence tried {{to secure the}} election of the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Ohio, former lieutenant governor Warren G. Harding. The Republicans suffered losses in the 1910 elections as the Democrats took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> and slashed the Republican majority in the Senate. In New Jersey, Democrat Woodrow Wilson was elected governor, and Harding lost his race in Ohio.|$|E
5|$|In {{its first}} {{election}} campaign in 1984, BSP fielded Mayawati for the Lok Sabha (Lower House) seat of Kairana in the Muzaffarnagar district, for Bijnor in 1985, and for Haridwar in 1987. In 1989 she was elected as the representative for Bijnor, with 183,189 votes, winning by 8,879 votes. Although BSP {{did not win}} <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> the electoral experience led to considerable activity for Mayawati {{over the next five}} years, as she worked with Mahsood Ahmed and other organisers. The party won three seats in the 1989 national election and two seats 1991.|$|E

5|$|Stanley gained {{national}} notoriety for {{his actions}} against U.S. Steel. In 1909, he introduced a resolution calling for {{an investigation of the}} company, but it died in the House Rules Committee. A second resolution, introduced in June 1910, passed the House, but was ignored by President William Howard Taft. Stanley introduced a stronger resolution later that month, but it was killed in committee. After Republicans lost <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> in the 1910 congressional elections, Stanley reintroduced his resolution. House Speaker Champ Clark appointed him as chairman of a nine-member committee to investigate U.S. Steel.|$|E
5|$|A House select {{committee}} headed by John Quincy Adams, an ardent abolitionist who disliked slaveholders like Tyler, condemned the president's {{use of the}} veto and assailed his character. While the committee's report did not formally recommend impeachment, it clearly established the possibility, and in August 1842 the House endorsed the committee's report. Adams sponsored {{a constitutional amendment to}} change both houses' two-thirds requirement (for overriding vetoes) to a simple majority, but neither house approved. The Whigs were unable to pursue further impeachment proceedings in the subsequent 28th Congress—in the elections of 1842 they retained a majority in the Senate but lost <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House.</b> Near the end of Tyler's term in office, on March 3, 1845, Congress overrode his veto of a minor bill relating to revenue cutters—the first override of a presidential veto.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{played a}} key role in 1856 in {{bringing}} forward John C. Frémont as a moderate Republican presidential nominee. Because of his success as speaker, Banks was considered a possible presidential contender, and his name was put in nomination by supporters (knowing that he supported Frémont) at the Know Nothing convention, held one week before the Republicans met. Banks then refused the Know Nothing nomination, which went instead to former President Millard Fillmore. Banks was active on the stump in support of Frémont, who lost the election to James Buchanan; Banks easily won reelection to his own seat. Democrats, however, regained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives, depriving him of the speakership.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, the Obama {{administration}} {{passed the}} Affordable Care Act, {{which made the}} most sweeping reforms to the nation's healthcare system in nearly five decades, including mandates, subsidies and insurance exchanges. The law caused {{a significant reduction in}} the number and percentage of people without health insurance, with 24 million covered during 2016, but remains controversial due to its impact on healthcare costs, insurance premiums, and economic performance. Although the recession reached its trough in June 2009, voters remained frustrated with the slow pace of the economic recovery. The Republicans, who stood in opposition to Obama's policies, won <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives with a landslide in 2010 and control of the Senate in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The tariff fight {{continued}} into the 50th Congress, which opened in 1887, in which Democrats retained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> with a reduced majority. By that time, Cleveland had openly sided with the tariff reformers and backed the proposals introduced in 1888 by Representative Roger Q. Mills of Texas. Mills had replaced Morrison at Ways and Means after the latter's defeat for reelection, and was as {{much in favor of}} tariff reform as the Illinoisan had been. Mills's bill would make small cuts to tariffs on raw materials, but relatively deeper cuts to those on manufactured goods; Randall, representing a manufacturing district, opposed it immediately. Randall was again ill and absent from the House when the Mills tariff passed by a 162 to 149 vote. The Senate, now Republican-controlled, refused to consider the bill, and it died with the 50th Congress in 1889.|$|E
5|$|The {{warning was}} appropriate, {{for in the}} Congressional elections, Republicans won their biggest {{landslide}} in decades, taking full <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> while the Populists lost most of their support. Cleveland's factional enemies gained control of the Democratic Party in state after state, including full control in Illinois and Michigan, and made major gains in Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and other states. Wisconsin and Massachusetts {{were two of the}} few states that remained under the control of Cleveland's allies. The Democratic opposition were close to controlling two-thirds of the vote at the 1896 national convention, which they needed to nominate their own candidate. They failed for lack of unity and a national leader, as Illinois governor John Peter Altgeld had been born in Germany and was ineligible to be nominated for President.|$|E
50|$|Elections for all House {{seats and}} 35 Senate seats were held on November 4, 2008, across the country.

That year, Democrats also took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State <b>House</b> for <b>the</b> first time in Gleason's tenure as state chairman. However, in 2010, the party had the most successful cycle in its history, winning that year's gubernatorial election, a Senate seat, five new Congressional seats, retaining <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State Senate, and retaking <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State <b>House.</b> In 2012, <b>the</b> party also won 12 new county courthouse majorities and one victory for statewide court.|$|R
50|$|General {{elections}} {{were held in}} Gibraltar on 16 January 1992.

5|$|As Democrats took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> in 1875, Randall was {{considered}} among the candidates for Speaker of the House. Many in the caucus hesitated, however, believing Randall to be too close to railroad interests and uncertain on the money question. His leadership in the Salary Grab may have harmed him, as well. Randall was also occupied by an intra-party battle with William A. Wallace {{for control of the}} Pennsylvania Democratic Party. Wallace, who had been elected to the United States Senate in 1874, was weakened by rumors that he had taken bribes from the railroads while a member of the State Senate. Randall wanted control of the Democratic machine statewide, and the Wallace faction's vulnerability on the bribery rumors provided the opportunity. In January 1875, he had friends in the state legislature begin an investigation into Wallace's clique, which ultimately turned state Democratic leaders against the senator. At the state Democratic convention in September 1875, Randall (with the help of his old ally, Squire McMullen) triumphed, putting his men in control of the state party.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2006 election, Hastert {{expressed}} his intent to seek reelection as Speaker if the Republicans maintained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House.</b> Hastert was reelected for an eleventh term {{to his seat}} in the House with nearly 60 percent of the vote, but that year the Republicans lost control of both the Senate and the House to the Democrats following a wave of voter discontent with the Iraq War, the Federal response to Hurricane Katrina, {{and a series of}} scandals among congressional Republicans. The day after the November election, Hastert announced he would not seek to become minority leader when the 110th Congress convened in January 2007. Later that month, John Boehner of Ohio defeated Mike Pence of Indiana in a 168-27 vote of the House Republican Conference election to become minority leader for the 110th Congress. The House Democratic Caucus unanimously selected House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to be Speaker (succeeding Hastert) for the 110th Congress.|$|E
5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is closely {{associated}} with humans. They {{are believed to have}} become associated with humans around 10,000 years ago. Subspecies P. d. bactrianus is least associated with humans and considered to be evolutionarily closer to the ancestral noncommensal populations. Usually, it is regarded as a pest, since it consumes agricultural products and spreads disease to humans and their domestic animals. Even birdwatchers often hold it in little regard because of its molestation of other birds. In most of the world, the house sparrow is not protected by law. Attempts to control house sparrows include the trapping, poisoning, or shooting of adults; the destruction of their nests and eggs; or less directly, blocking nest holes and scaring off sparrows with noise, glue, or porcupine wire. However, the house sparrow can be beneficial to humans, as well, especially by eating insect pests, and attempts at the large-scale <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> sparrow have failed.|$|E
