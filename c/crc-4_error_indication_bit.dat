40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an error control {{algorithm}} for available-bit-rate (ABR) multicasting (point-to-multipoint connection). The error control algorithm for ABR multicast 1) uses the resource management cells for flow control {{to carry the}} information for error control, 2) configures a temporarily partial connection called virtual connection, {{which is based on}} the feedback information, and 3) retransmits the packets from the source to the requesting destinations via virtual connection. The error control algorithm requires that a rate partitioner, one additional queue, and a timer are kept and no status for each destination is maintained in the source. In addition, a sequence number and an <b>error</b> <b>indication</b> <b>bit</b> are fedback to the network by the destination and some registers for error control are maintained and operations, i. e., comparison, taking minimum or maximum, and filtration, are performed in the switch.

In aviation, lateral navigation is one of two guidance types: linear guidance and angular guidance. In linear guidance, the aircraft's deviation to the left or right of the desired ground track is given as a distance between the aircraft's current position and the desired track. In angular guidance, the <b>error</b> <b>indication</b> is given in degrees of angle from the desired line relative to a ground-based navigation device. To provide an illustration, as the aircraft approaches the ground device with a constant angular error, its distance to the desired ground line decreases. In the context of aviation instrument approaches, an LNAV approach (one that uses lateral navigation) is implied to be a GPS-based approach and to have linear lateral guidance. A VOR-based approach will have angular lateral guidance.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a compact, high-speed, and highly {{testable}} parallel two-rail code checker, particularly suitable to implementing embedded checkers. In fact, it requires only two input codewords {{to satisfy the}} Totally-Self-Checking or Strongly Code-Disjoint property {{with respect to a}} wide set of realistic internal faults. Our checker can be employed to check the correct operation of a connected functional block using the two-rail code, to implement the output two-rail code checker of “normal” checkers for unordered codes, or to join together the error messages produced by various checkers (possibly using different codes) present within the same self-checking system. The behavior of our checker has been verified by means of electrical level simulations (performed using HSPICE), considering both nominal values and statistical variations of electrical parameters. We also propose a possible modification to our checker internal structure that makes it able to provide an output <b>error</b> <b>indication</b> remaining latched until the application of a proper reset signal. Depending on the considered application and recovery technique to be employed upon the generation of an <b>error</b> <b>indication</b> at the checker output, one proposed solution or the other may be preferable...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{probability}} that transient faults, multiple or single, affecting a checker of a self-checking circuit (with particular reference {{to the case of}} circuits using the two-rail code, the parity code, the Berger code and the Bose–Lin code) give rise to no-harm alarms, here defined as <b>indications</b> of <b>errors</b> neither denoting the presence of an incorrect word at the output of the functional block, nor denoting the presence of checker internal faults possibly compromising its ability to discriminate input codewords from input non-codewords. Differently from all other <b>error</b> <b>indications,</b> no-harm alarms could be conveniently ignored (or tolerated) by the system, with no need to adopt any recovery strategy upon their reception, otherwise for instance leading to exclude the self checking circuit from the whole system, or to degrade system’s performance. A new property (No-Harm Alarm Robustness) is defined for checkers, allowing to discriminate “true” <b>error</b> <b>indications</b> from no-harm alarms. A possible approach to design checkers featuring such a property is proposed. The behavior of the derived checkers has been verified by means of electrical level simulations, and their costs are discussed...|$|R
