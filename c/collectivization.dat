5|$|In 1928, the Soviet Union began <b>collectivization</b> in Ingria. During the <b>collectivization</b> {{and ethnic}} cleansing, the Soviets captured, killed and {{deported}} Ingrian peasants, provoking widespread criticism by the Finnish media in 1930. Two years later, the nationalist Lapua Movement unsuccessfully attempted {{to overthrow the}} Finnish government in the Mäntsälä rebellion.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, Soviet {{agricultural}} and economic policies, including <b>collectivization</b> and five-year {{plans for the}} national economy, led to famine and political repression.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Leap Forward, Pan {{sympathized with}} Marshal Peng Dehuai, {{a critic of}} Mao Zedong's <b>collectivization</b> policy. As a result, in 1958 he was {{dismissed}} as party chief of Henan and subjected to persecution, but was later rehabilitated.|$|E
5|$|During the Anti-Rightist Movement and the Great Leap Forward, Pan Fusheng {{sympathized with}} Marshal Peng Dehuai, who criticized Mao's {{disastrous}} <b>collectivization</b> policies. As a result, {{he became a}} major target of persecution by the fervent Mao loyalist Wu Zhipu, the Second Secretary of Henan, {{with the approval of}} the CPC Central Committee.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1957 Mao {{suggested}} a nationwide programme of mass <b>collectivization,</b> in which China's farmers would be forcibly relocated to large agricultural communes and all private property would be eliminated. Mao's theories on mass <b>collectivization</b> became {{the basis of the}} Great Leap Forward, a national economic plan that began in 1958 which caused a man-made famine across the country that lasted for several years. By 1959, {{tens of millions of people}} had starved to death. From October–December 1958, the economic system in the countryside broke down as farmers refused to go to work in the fields, raided government granaries for food, and in Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Qinghai, rebelled. In December 1958 China's leaders quietly decided to reverse the policies of the Great Leap.|$|E
5|$|The Sami peoples {{were subject}} to forced <b>collectivization,</b> {{with more than half}} of their {{reindeer}} herds collectivized in 1928–1930. In addition, the traditional Sami herding practices were phased out in favor of the more economically profitable Komi approach, which emphasized permanent settlements over free herding. Since the Sami culture is strongly tied to the herding practices, this resulted in the Sami people gradually losing their language and traditional herding knowledge. Most Sami were forced to settle in the village of Lovozero, which became the cultural center of the Sami people in Russia. Those Sami resisting the <b>collectivization</b> {{were subject to}} forced labor or death. Various forms of repression against the Sami continued until Stalin's death in 1953. In the 1990s, 40% of the Sami lived in urbanized areas, although some herd reindeer across much of the region.|$|E
5|$|Gomułka, in {{his public}} speeches, criticized {{the hardships of}} Stalinism and promised reforms to democratize the country; this was {{received}} with much enthusiasm by Polish society. By mid-November, Gomułka had secured substantive gains in his negotiations with the Soviets: the cancellation of Poland's existing debts, new preferential trade terms, abandonment of the unpopular Soviet-imposed <b>collectivization</b> of Polish agriculture, and permission to liberalize policy towards the Roman Catholic Church. In December, the status of Soviet forces in Poland, the Northern Group of Forces, was finally regulated.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the Soviet {{and native}} Stalinists was {{widespread}} among {{not only the}} general population but also the PZPR ranks, which limited the oppressive system's damage in Poland to well below that of other European communist-ruled countries. Political violence after 1947 was not widespread. The Church, subjected to partial property confiscations, remained largely intact, the marginalized to a considerable degree intelligentsia retained its potential to affect future reforms, the peasantry avoided wholesale <b>collectivization</b> and remnants of private enterprise survived. Gradual liberalizing changes took place between Stalin's death in 1953 and the Polish October of 1956.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet period saw a rapid {{increase}} of the population, although most of it remained confined to urbanized territories along the sea coast and the railroads. The Sami people were subject to forced <b>collectivization,</b> including forced relocation to Lovozero and other centralized settlements, and overall the peninsula was heavily industrialized and militarized, largely due to its strategic position and {{the discovery of the}} vast apatite deposits in the 1920s. As a result, the ecology of the peninsula suffered major ecological damage, including contamination by military nuclear waste and nickel smelting.|$|E
5|$|The <b>collectivization</b> {{efforts in}} the 1930s led to the {{concentration}} of the reindeer herds in kolkhozes (collective farms), which, in turn, were further consolidated into a few large-scale state farms in the late 1950s–early 1970s. By the mid-1970s, the state farms were further consolidated into just two, based in Lovozero and Krasnoshchelye. The consolidations were rationalized by the necessity to isolate the herders from the military installations, {{as well as by}} the need to flood some territories to construct hydroelectric plants.|$|E
5|$|The Finns {{had many}} reasons {{to turn down the}} Soviet proposals. Finland had started {{negotiations}} for a military co-operation with Sweden, and the Finns had great hopes for the joint Finnish–Swedish defense for the Ålands islands {{and did not want to}} jeopardize these negotiations. In addition, the violent <b>collectivization,</b> purges, show trials and executions in Stalin's Soviet Union had given the country a bad reputation. Furthermore, most of the Finnish Communist leadership in the Soviet Union was executed during the Great Purge. The Soviet Union did not therefore seem to be a reliable contracting party. The Soviet envoys sent to negotiate with Finns were officially of relatively low rank, but as Väinö Tanner put it later, the Finns assumed rightly that they represented of some higher organ of State, probably the Soviet secret police NKVD.|$|E
25|$|Between 1927 and 1934 <b>collectivization</b> of {{agriculture}} and a rapid expansion of cotton production took place, especially in the southern region. Soviet <b>collectivization</b> policy brought violence against peasants and forced resettlement occurred throughout Tajikistan. Consequently, some peasants fought <b>collectivization</b> and revived the Basmachi movement. Some small scale industrial development also occurred during this time along with the expansion of irrigation infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Collectivization</b> {{had been}} {{encouraged}} since the revolution, but in 1928, {{only about one}} percent of farm land was collectivized, and despite efforts to encourage and coerce <b>collectivization,</b> the rather optimistic first five-year plan only forecast 15 percent of farms to be run collectively.|$|E
25|$|After the {{publication}} of the article, the pressure for <b>collectivization</b> temporarily abated and peasants started leaving collective farms. According to Martin Kitchen, the number of members of collective farms dropped by 50% in 1930. But soon <b>collectivization</b> was intensified again, and by 1936, about 90% of Soviet agriculture was collectivized.|$|E

25|$|In the 20th century, the Soviets forced <b>collectivization</b> {{upon the}} Ket. They were officially {{recognized}} as Kets in the 1930s when the Soviet Union started {{to implement the}} self-definition policy with respect to indigenous peoples. However, Ket traditions continued to be suppressed and self-initiative was discouraged. <b>Collectivization</b> was completed by the 1950s and the Russian lifestyle and language forced upon the Ket people.|$|E
25|$|Rumors {{circulated}} {{in the villages}} warning the rural residents that <b>collectivization</b> would bring disorder, hunger, famine, {{and the destruction of}} crops and livestock. Readings and reinterpretations of Soviet newspapers labeled <b>collectivization</b> as a second serfdom. Villagers were afraid the old landowners/serf owners were coming back and that the villagers joining the collective farm would face starvation and famine. More reason for peasants to believe <b>collectivization</b> was a second serfdom was that entry into the kolkhoz had been forced. Farmers did {{not have the right to}} leave the collective without permission. The level of state procurements and prices on crops also enforced the serfdom analogy. The government would take a majority of the crops and pay extremely low prices. The serfs during the 1860s were paid nothing but <b>collectivization</b> still reminded the peasants of serfdom. To them, this “second serfdom” became code for the Communist betrayal of the revolution. To the peasants, the revolution was about giving more freedom and land to the peasants, but instead they had to give up their land and livestock to the collective farm.|$|E
25|$|The Soviets confiscated the {{remaining}} Ingush properties by <b>collectivization</b> and dekulakization and unified Chechnya and Ingushetia into Chechen-Ingush ASSR.|$|E
25|$|Between 1949 and 1953, {{a forced}} <b>collectivization</b> was attempted. After its failure, {{a policy of}} gradual {{liberalization}} was followed.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the initial}} plans, <b>collectivization,</b> {{accompanied}} by the bad harvest of 19321933, did {{not live up to}} expectations. Between 1929 and 1932 there was a massive fall in agricultural production resulting in famine in the countryside. Stalin and the CPSU blamed the prosperous peasants, referred to as 'kulaks' (Russian: fist), who were organizing resistance to <b>collectivization.</b> Allegedly, many kulaks had been hoarding grain in order to speculate on higher prices, thereby sabotaging grain collection. Stalin resolved to eliminate them as a class.|$|E
25|$|According to Valentino, between 60,000 and 300,000 {{people may}} {{have been killed in}} Romania {{beginning}} in 1945 as part of agricultural <b>collectivization</b> and political repression.|$|E
25|$|The {{first phase}} <b>collectivization</b> {{resulted}} in only modest improvements in output. Famine along the mid-Yangzi was averted in 1956 through the timely allocation of food-aid, but in 1957 the Party's {{response was to}} increase {{the proportion of the}} harvest collected by the state to insure against further disasters. Moderates within the Party, including Zhou Enlai, argued for a reversal of <b>collectivization</b> on the grounds that claiming the bulk of the harvest for the state had made the people's food-security dependent upon the constant, efficient, and transparent functioning of the government.|$|E
25|$|Faced {{with the}} refusal to hand grain over, a {{decision}} was made at a plenary session of the Central Committee in November 1929 to embark on a nationwide program of <b>collectivization.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{areas where}} the major {{agricultural}} activity was nomadic herding, <b>collectivization</b> met with massive resistance and major losses and confiscation of livestock. Livestock in Kazakhstan fell from 7 million cattle to 1.6 million and from 22 million sheep to 1.7 million. Restrictions on migration proved ineffective and half a million migrated to other regions of Central Asia and 1.5 million to China. Of those who remained, {{as many as a}} million died in the resulting famine. In Mongolia, a so-called 'Soviet dependency', attempted <b>collectivization</b> was abandoned in 1932 after the loss of 8 million head of livestock.|$|E
25|$|Theoretically, landless peasants {{were to be}} {{the biggest}} {{beneficiaries}} from <b>collectivization,</b> because it promised them an opportunity to take an equal share in labor and its rewards. In fact, however, rural areas did not have many landless peasants, given the wholesale redistribution of land following the Revolution. Alternatively, for those with property, <b>collectivization</b> meant forfeiting land up to the collective farms and selling most of the harvest to the state at minimal prices set by the state itself. This, in turn, engendered opposition to the idea. Furthermore, <b>collectivization</b> involved significant changes in the traditional village life of Russian peasants within a very short time frame, despite the long Russian rural tradition of collectivism in the village obshchina or mir. The changes were even more dramatic in other places, such as in Ukraine, with its tradition of individual farming, in the Soviet republics of Central Asia, and in the trans-Volga steppes, where for a family to have a herd of livestock was not only a matter of sustenance, but of pride as well.|$|E
25|$|Collectivist anarchism advocates the {{abolition}} of {{both the state and}} private ownership of the means of production. It instead envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves. For the <b>collectivization</b> of the means of production, it was originally envisaged that workers will revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production. Once <b>collectivization</b> takes place, money would be abolished to be replaced with labour notes and workers' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations based on job difficulty and the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market.|$|E
25|$|In April 1929, the Muslim villagers of mountainous Adjara rose in {{arms against}} {{compulsory}} <b>collectivization</b> and religious persecution. The Soviet troops were invoked and the revolt was quickly put down. Thousands of Adjarians were deported from the republic.|$|E
25|$|In 1928 <b>collectivization</b> of {{agriculture}} started in Ingria. To facilitate it, in 1929–1931, 18,000 people (4320 families), kulaks (independent peasants) from North Ingria, were deported to East Karelia, the Kola Peninsula {{as well as}} Kazakhstan and Central Asia.|$|E
25|$|Between 1929 and 1933, Chernobyl {{suffered}} from killings during Stalin's <b>collectivization</b> campaign. It was also {{affected by the}} famine that resulted from Stalin's policies. The Polish community of Chernobyl was deported to Kazakhstan in 1936, during the Frontier Clearances.|$|E
25|$|Platonov {{was one of}} {{the first}} Russian thinkers to criticize Stalin's plans for <b>collectivization</b> as inhumane. More so, Platonov was living in the Soviet Union at the time. Many other critics were dissidents who had fled the country for places like France.|$|E
25|$|In December 1939, Monnet {{was sent}} to London to oversee the <b>collectivization</b> of the British and French war industries. His {{influence}} inspired Charles de Gaulle and Winston Churchill to agree on an Anglo-French union, {{in an attempt to}} rival the alliance between Germany and Italy.|$|E
25|$|Due to high {{government}} production quotas, peasants received, as a rule, {{less for}} their labor {{than they did}} before <b>collectivization,</b> and some refused to work. Merle Fainsod estimated that, in 1952, collective farm earnings were only one fourth of the cash income from private plots on Soviet collective farms. In many cases, the immediate effect of <b>collectivization</b> was to reduce output and {{cut the number of}} livestock in half. The subsequent recovery of the agricultural production was also impeded by the losses suffered by the Soviet Union during World War II and the severe drought of 1946. However the largest loss of livestock was caused by <b>collectivization</b> for all animals except pigs. The numbers of cows in the USSR fell from 33.2 million in 1928 to 27.8 million in 1941 and to 24.6 million in 1950. The number of pigs fell from 27.7 million in 1928 to 27.5 million in 1941 and then to 22.2 million in 1950. The number of sheep fell from 114.6 million in 1928 to 91.6 million in 1941 and to 93.6 million in 1950. The number of horses fell from 36.1 million in 1928 to 21.0 million in 1941 and to 12.7 million in 1950. Only by the late 1950s did Soviet farm animal stocks begin to approach 1928 levels.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} changed incredibly {{quickly in}} the fall of 1929 and winter of 1930. Between September and December 1929, <b>collectivization</b> increased from 7.4% to 15%, but in the first two months of 1930, 11 million households joined collectivized farms, pushing the total to nearly 60% almost overnight.|$|E
25|$|Stalin's wife, Nadezhda Allilueva, {{learned about}} the famine from Ukrainian {{students}} at the technical school she was attending. They described acts of cannibalism, p 421. and bands of orphaned children. Allilueva complained to Stalin, who then ordered the OGPU to purge all the college students who had taken part in <b>collectivization.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{the winter}} of 1928-29, Ware {{returned}} to the United States, where he attempted to interest American agricultural equipment manufacturers in the Soviet market. He managed to convince {{a number of companies}} to send test tractors and implements along with mechanics to assemble the products. He stayed in the USSR through the <b>collectivization</b> campaign of 1929-30.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{numbers for}} collectivized area (the column with percent of sown area in collective {{use in the}} table above) are biased upward by two technical factors. First, these official numbers are calculated as percent of sown area in peasant farmsteads, excluding the area cultivated by sovkhozes and other agricultural users. Estimates based on total sown area (including state farms) reduce the share of collective farms between 1935-1940 to about 80%. Second, the household plots of kolkhoz members (i.e., collectivized farmsteads) {{are included in the}} land base of collective farms. Without the household plots, arable land in collective cultivation in 1940 was 96.4% of land in collective farms, and not 99.8% as shown by official statistics. Although there is no arguing with the fact that <b>collectivization</b> was sweeping and total between 1928 and 1940, the table below provides different (more realistic) numbers on the extent of <b>collectivization</b> of sown areas.|$|E
