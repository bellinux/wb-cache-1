5000|$|<b>Cysticercus</b> was {{discovered}} in the late 17th century CE as a parasitic bladder. It {{was believed to be}} a different organism from the adult tapeworm (Taenia solium), but still closely related to tapeworms for their similarly-looking scolex. Hence, it was given a proper scientific name Taenia cellulosae in 1800 by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin. At the same time another German Johann Zeder had created a new genus Cysticercosis for a dog tapeworm. This genus was accepted for all bladder worms of Taenia. It became a tradition to refer to the larva of Taenia solium as <b>Cysticercus</b> cellulosae, that of beef tapeworm (T. sanginata) as <b>Cysticercus</b> bovis, that of sheep tapeworm (T. ovis) as <b>Cysticercus</b> ovis, that of ruminant tapeworm (T. krabbei) as <b>Cysticercus</b> tarandi, and that of the dog tapeworm (T. crassiceps) as <b>Cysticercus</b> longicollis.

50|$|Hatching of the T. serialis usually occurs only if {{the eggs}} {{have been exposed to}} gastric {{secretions}} proceeded by intestinal secretions.

50|$|Pigs ingest {{the eggs}} from human faeces or {{vegetation}} contaminated with human excreta. The embryonated eggs enter the intestine where they hatch into motile oncospheres. The embryonic and basement membranes are removed by the host's digestive enzymes (particularly pepsin). Then the free oncospheres get attached on the intestinal wall using their hooks. With {{the help of}} digestive enzymes from the penetration glands, they penetrate the intestinal mucosa to enter blood and lymphatic vessels. They move along the general circulatory system to various organs, and large numbers are cleared in the liver. The surviving oncospheres preferentially migrate to striated muscles, {{as well as the}} brain, liver, and other tissues, where they settle to form cysts called <b>cysticerci.</b> A single cysticercus is spherical, measuring 1-2 cm in diameter, and contains an invaginated protoscolex.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundSolitary <b>cysticercus</b> {{granuloma}} {{and single}} parenchymal calcified lesion are two common neuroimaging abnormalities in Indian patients with epilepsy. In this study, we evaluated {{the frequency and}} predictors of seizure recurrence in patients presenting with new onset epilepsy or single epileptic seizures and these two different imaging findings. Materials and methodsWe enrolled 115 patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy. All patients were clinically evaluated and were treated with oxcarbazepine. No anti-helminthic treatment was prescribed. The patients were followed up for 6 months. In the solitary cystic granuloma group, repeat computed tomography was done after 6 months. ResultsThe study included 80 patients with solitary <b>cysticercus</b> granuloma and 35 patients with a single calcified lesion. Twenty (25 %) patients with solitary <b>cysticercus</b> granuloma and 12 (34. 3 %) patients with parenchymal calcified lesion had a seizure recurrence {{during the study period}} (p= 0. 307). After 6 months, 57 (71. 3 %) patients in the solitary <b>cysticercus</b> granuloma group demonstrated complete resolution of the granuloma and in 21 (26. 2 %) patients the granuloma transformed into a calcified lesion. In the solitary <b>cysticercus</b> granuloma group, a family history of seizure, serial seizures and calcification on follow-up neuroimaging (p< 0. 05) were significantly associated with recurrence of seizures. In patients with a single parenchymal calcified lesions, electroencephalographic abnormalities and serial seizures (p=< 0. 05) were significant predictors of recurrence. Kaplan–Meier statistics revealed that the seizure recurrence rate was insignificantly higher in patients with calcified lesions than in patients with solitary cysticercosis granulomas. ConclusionIn conclusion, in patients with solitary <b>cysticercus</b> granuloma, a family history of seizures, serial seizures and calcification of the granuloma, and in patients with a calcified brain lesion, electroencephalographic abnormalities, family history of epilepsy and serial seizures were associated with an increased risk of seizure recurrence...|$|R
40|$|Fifty {{four cases}} of single small (< 20 mm) {{enhancing}} CT lesions (SSECTLs) {{of the brain}} that were excised between 1987 and 1995 were reviewed histologically. In 28 cases the entire <b>cysticercus</b> or its parts were found. In the remaining 26 cases, most had a histological picture suggestive of a parasitic granuloma. In six of these 26 cases, small ovoid masses corresponding in morphology to the intracorporeal vacuoles of a <b>cysticercus</b> were seen lying free in the cavitary space of the granuloma. This lends further strength to the contention that SSECTLs of the brain are caused by <b>cysticercus,</b> and that {{in the event of a}} surgical excision, absence of obvious parasitic parts should necessitate a closer search, as calcareous residues of the parasite might be the only evidence of the cysticercal aetiology in the granuloma. ...|$|R
50|$|Taenia saginata (synonym Taeniarhynchus saginata), {{commonly}} known as the beef tapeworm, is a zoonotic tapeworm belonging to the order Cyclophyllidea and genus Taenia. It is an intestinal parasite in humans causing taeniasis (a type of helminthiasis) and cysticercosis in cattle. Cattle are the intermediate hosts, where larval development occurs, while humans are definitive hosts harbouring the adult worms. It is found globally and most prevalently where cattle are raised and beef is consumed. It is relatively common in Africa, Europe, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Latin America. Humans are generally infected as a result of eating raw or undercooked beef which contains the infective larvae, called <b>cysticerci.</b> As hermaphrodites, each body segment called proglottid has complete sets of both male and female reproductive systems. Thus, reproduction is by self-fertilisation. From humans, embryonated eggs, called oncospheres, are released with faeces and are transmitted to cattle through contaminated fodder. Oncospheres develop inside muscle, liver, and lungs of cattle into infective <b>cysticerci.</b>|$|E
50|$|Helminthic therapy {{consists}} of the inoculation of the patient with specific parasitic intestinal nematodes (helminths). A number of such organisms are currently being investigated for their use as treatment including: Trichuris suis ova, commonly known as pig whipworm eggs; Necator americanus, commonly known as hookworms; Trichuris trichiura ova, {{commonly referred to as}} human whipworm eggs; and Hymenolepis diminuta, commonly known as rat tapeworm <b>cysticerci.</b>|$|E

50|$|Cysticercosis was {{described}} by Johannes Udalric Rumler in 1555; however, the connection between tapeworms and cysticercosis had not been recognized at that time. Around 1850, Friedrich Küchenmeister fed pork containing <b>cysticerci</b> of T. solium to humans awaiting execution in a prison, and after they had been executed, he recovered the developing and adult tapeworms in their intestines. By {{the middle of the}} 19th century, it was established that cysticercosis was caused by the ingestion of the eggs of T. solium.|$|E
50|$|Antibodies to <b>cysticerci</b> can be {{demonstrated}} in serum by EITB (Enzyme Linked Immunotransfer Blot) assay and in CSF by ELISA. An immunoblot assay using lentil-lectin (agglutinin from Lens culinaris) is highly sensitive and specific. However, Individuals with intracranial lesions and calcifications may be seronegative. In the CDC’s immunoblot assay, cysticercosis-specific antibodies can react with structural glycoprotein antigens from the larval cysts of Taenia solium. However, this is mainly a research tool not widely available in clinical practice and nearly unobtainable in resource limited settings.|$|E
