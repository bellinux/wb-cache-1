40|$|It is classically {{known that}} generic smooth maps of R^ 2 into R^ 3 admit only <b>cross</b> <b>cap</b> singularities. This {{suggests}} that the class of cross caps might be an important object in differential geometry. We show that the standard <b>cross</b> <b>cap</b> (u,uv,v^ 2) has non-trivial isometric deformations with infinite dimensional freedom. Since there are several geometric invariants for cross caps, the existence of isometric deformations suggests that one can ask which invariants of cross caps are intrinsic. In this paper, we show {{that there are three}} fundamental intrinsic invariants for cross caps. The existence of extrinsic invariants is also shown. Comment: 16 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

40|$|During {{high-speed}} stream (HSS) events {{the solar}} wind speed increases, and the <b>cross</b> polar <b>cap</b> potential increases, leading to increased Joule heating at high latitudes. The heat input at high latitudes heats the polar regions, which then conducts to lower latitudes, producing global heating.

Cooling occurs as the <b>cross</b> polar <b>cap</b> potential decreases and continues for several days after the <b>cross</b> polar <b>cap</b> potential has returned to background values. Polar cap ionospheric observations are compared to model simulations of heating and cooling, providing evidence that the thermospheric model is capturing the HSS energy input and the post-HSS multiday return to pre-HSS conditions.

Since the singular sets of Kossowski metrics are the union of regular curves on the domains of definitions, and Whitney metrics admit only isolated singularities, these {{two classes of}} metrics are disjoint. In this paper, we give several characterizations of intrinsic invariants of cuspidal edges and cross caps in these classes of metrics.

Studies have shown that the <b>cross</b> polar <b>cap</b> potential responds linearly to the solar wind electric field under nominal solar wind conditions but asymptotes to the order of 200 kV for large electric field. Saturation of the <b>cross</b> polar <b>cap</b> {{potential is}} also found to occur in MHD simulations. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. Two well‐developed models are those of Siscoe et al. (2002), herein referred to as the Siscoe‐Hill model, and of Kivelson and Ridley (2008), herein referred to as the Kivelson‐Ridley model. In this study, we compare the mathematical formulas as well as the predictions of the two models with data. We find that the two models predict similar saturation limits. Their difference can be expressed in terms of a factor, which is close to unity during a saturation interval. A survey of the differences in the model predictions show that, on average, the potential of the Kivelson‐Ridley model is smaller than that of the Siscoe‐Hill model by 10 kV. Measurements of AMIE, DMSP, PC index, and SuperDARN are used to differentiate between the two models. However, given the uncertainties of the measurements, it is impossible to conclude that one model does a better job than the other of predicting the observed <b>cross</b> polar <b>cap</b> potentials.
