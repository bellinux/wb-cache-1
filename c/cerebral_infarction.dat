40|$|Abstract Background Cerebellar and <b>cerebral</b> <b>infarctions</b> {{caused by}} the {{syndrome}} of cervical rib with thrombosis of subclavian artery are very unusual. Case presentation We report {{the case of a}} 49 -year-old male patient with a right cervical rib compression leading to subclavian arterial thrombosis and both cerebellar and <b>cerebral</b> <b>infarctions</b> secondary to retrograde thromboembolisation. Follow-up imaging revealed partial resolution of the thrombosis after combined anti-coagulant and anti-platelet therapy. The cervical rib and first costa were surgically removed to prevent additional events. Conclusion Cervical rib vascular compression should be promptly diagnosed and treated in order to avoid further complications, including cerebrovascular ischemic events. </p...|$|R

2500|$|In 1958, Bach-y-Rita's father, Pedro, {{suffered}} a <b>cerebral</b> <b>infarction</b> (stroke) which caused paralysis {{to one side}} of his body and damaged his ability to speak. [...] George Bach-y-Rita—a psychiatrist and Paul's brother—succeeded in treating Pedro so {{that he was able to}} lead a normal life, despite the opinion of several doctors that this was impossible. [...] When Pedro died, an autopsy, performed by Dr. Mary Jane Aguilar revealed that Paul's father Pedro had {{suffered a}} major stroke and suffered severe damage to a large portion of his brain stem, which had not repaired itself after the stroke. [...] The fact that he had made such a significant recovery suggested that his brain had reorganized itself, providing evidence for neuroplasticity.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the prevalence of unrecognized myocardial infarction (UMI) detected with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and whether it is related to cerebral ischemic lesions on MRI in an elderly population–based cohort. BackgroundThere is a correlation between stroke and recognized myocardial infarction (RMI) and between stroke and UMI detected with electrocardiography, whereas the prevalence of stroke in subjects with MRI-detected UMI is unknown. MethodsCerebral MRI and cardiac late-enhancement MRI were performed on 394 randomly selected 75 -year-old subjects (188 women, 206 men). Images were assessed for cerebral ischemic lesions and myocardial infarction (MI) scars. Medical records were scrutinized. Subjects with MI scars, with or without a hospital diagnosis of MI, were classified as RMI or UMI, respectively. ResultsUMIs were found in 120 subjects (30 %) and RMIs in 21 (5 %). The prevalence of UMIs (p = 0. 004) and RMIs (p = 0. 02) was greater in men than in women. Men with RMI displayed an increased prevalence of cortical and lacunar <b>cerebral</b> <b>infarctions,</b> whereas women with UMI more frequently had cortical <b>cerebral</b> <b>infarctions</b> (p = 0. 003). ConclusionsMI scars are more frequent in men than in women at 75 years of age. The prevalence of RMI is related to that of <b>cerebral</b> <b>infarctions...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose: No {{reports are}} {{available}} that compare local cerebral perfusion among groups of patients suffering from multiple <b>cerebral</b> <b>infarctions</b> {{with and without}} cognitive impairments. The present {{study was designed to}} correlate changes in regional cerebral perfusion that may lead to dementia among patients with multiple <b>cerebral</b> <b>infarctions</b> by comparing measurements of local cerebral blood flow. Methods: Local perfusion was measured using xenon-contrasted computed tomographic scanning among two groups of patients who had suffered from multiple cerebral infarctions: Group D (n= 12) were demented and had severe cognitive impairments, and group I (n=ll) were cognitively intact Results were compared with similar measurements among neurologically and cognitively normal, age-matched volunteers (group N, n = 16). Results: Mean local perfusion values were reduced among both groups with <b>cerebral</b> <b>infarctions</b> but to a more marked degree in group D (p< 0. 05). Perfusion of cerebral white matter was diffusely and severely reduced in group D (p< 0. 05) but was mildly reduced only in frontal and capsular white matter in group I (p< 0. 05). Perfusion of cerebral cortex was reduced in frontal (p< 0. 01) and temporal (p< 0. 01) regions among both groups but to a significantly greater degree in group D subjects (frontal, p< 0. 05; temporal...|$|R

40|$|Backround and Purpose: Delayed {{cerebral}} ischemia (DCI) {{remains the}} most relevant cause of neurological worsening after acute aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Underlying mechanisms causing DCI include cortical spreading depression (CSD). Analgosedation is a fundamental part of neurointensive care and helps optimizing clinical key parameters like arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow while simultaneously reducing cerebral oxygen consumption. It {{has been shown that}} sedative and analgesic substances influence receptor mediated spreading depolarisation and thus may result in neuroprotection. Nonetheless sedation itself could also negatively influence the course of SAH patients as it potentially cause complications. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyse the influence of sedation, in particular of Ketamine on the occurrence of DCI-related <b>cerebral</b> <b>infarctions</b> in patients with acute SAH with particular focus on the potential complications. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of patients with acute aneurysmal SAH. Sixty five patients matched the inclusion criteria. The clinical course as well as the cranial CAT scan imaging results were analysed. The treatment course on the intensive care unit (ICU) was characterized analysing the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS), complications of sedation as well as other clinical parameters including typical complications. Neurological outcome was analysed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Results: The median length of ventilation treatment was 20. 9 days (1 to 46 days, SD 7. 09). The median length of stay on the Intensive Care Unit was 23. 5 days (5 to 43 days, SD 6. 8). DCI-related <b>cerebral</b> <b>infarctions</b> occurred in nine patients (14 %). DCI-related <b>cerebral</b> <b>infarctions</b> occurred significantly less often in the patient cohort treated with sedation including Ketamine (7. 3 % versus 25 % in the non-Ketamine group, p= 0. 04). The rate of major complications was 7, 7 %. Outcome was not different regarding the groups being treated with different combinations of sedation. Conclusions: The rate of DCI-related <b>cerebral</b> <b>infarctions</b> following acute aneurysmal SAH was significantly lower in the patient group that received Ketamine...|$|R

40|$|A venous air {{embolism}} and paradoxical {{air embolism}} (PAE) are serious complications in patients undergoing a hepatectomy. We report {{a case of}} PAE and <b>cerebral</b> <b>infarctions</b> in a patient undergoing a hepatic resection using a Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA®). A 65 -year-old woman underwent a left lobe hepatectomy. During the middle phase of the liver resection with CUSA®, {{there was a sudden}} decrease in arterial blood pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide and SpO 2. With resuscitation, intraoperative ultrasonography revealed massive air emboli in both her left and right heart, which lasted for 40 min. The hepatectomy was completed after the disappearance of the air emboli from her heart. After surgery, her mental status was stuporous. The brain CT and MRI revealed multiple acute <b>cerebral</b> <b>infarctions.</b> Finally, she died from septic shock.
