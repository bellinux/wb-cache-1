This aircraft carries a 30-gallon [...] "slipper" [...] drop tank under the fuselage.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cartridge</b> <b>starters,</b> {{such as the}} Coffman engine starter, {{which used}} a device like a blank shotgun cartridge. These were popular for {{aircraft}} engines ...|$|R
50|$|The Coffman starter was {{the most}} common brand of <b>cartridge</b> <b>starters</b> during the mid-1930s, and the name was used as a generic description. Advances in {{electrical}} technology have made shotgun starters obsolete for most uses.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{military}} aircraft {{need to be}} started quicker than the electric method permits and hence they use other methods such as a <b>cartridge</b> turbine <b>starter</b> or [...] "cart starter". This is an impulse turbine impacted by burning gases from a cartridge, usually created by igniting a solid propellant similar to gunpowder. It is geared to rotate the engine and also connected to an automatic disconnect system, or overrunning clutch. The cartridge is set alight electrically and used to turn the starter's turbine.|$|R
5000|$|The Coffman device used a large blank {{cartridge}} containing Cordite that, when fired, pushed a piston forward. A screw thread {{driven by the}} piston engaged with the engine, turning it over. [...] This was in contrast with other type of <b>cartridge</b> <b>starter</b> which acted directly to drive the engine piston down and so turn {{the rest of the}} engine over, such as those used on the Field-Marshall agricultural diesel tractor.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{commercial}} aircraft and large military transport airplanes usually use {{what is called}} an auxiliary power unit (APU). It is normally a small gas turbine. Thus, {{one could say that}} using such an APU is using a small gas turbine to start a larger one. Low pressure (...) , high volume air from the compressor section of the APU is bled off through a system of pipes to the engines where it is directed into the starting system. This bleed air is directed into a mechanism to start the engine turning and begin pulling in air. The starter is usually an air turbine type, similar to the <b>cartridge</b> <b>starter,</b> but uses the APU's bleed air instead of the burning gases of the propellant cartridge. Most cart starters can also use APU air to turn them. When the rotating speed of the engine is sufficient to pull in enough air to support combustion, fuel is introduced and ignited. Once the engine ignites and reaches idle speed, the bleed air and ignition systems are shut off.|$|E

The windscreen of production Mk VIs was the same as the type fitted to the Mark III and some Mk Vs although it was fitted with an inward opening clear-view panel on the port quarter pane. The effect was to make 37000 ft seem like 28000 ft to the pilot, who would still have to wear an oxygen mask. Pressurisation was achieved by a Marshall-manufactured compressor located on the starboard side of the engine, fed by a long intake below the starboard exhaust stubs. Mk VIs were built with the Coffman <b>cartridge</b> <b>starter,</b> with a small teardrop fairing just ahead of the compressor intake.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{disadvantages}} of the shotgun starter are {{the need to}} keep a stock of cartridges, one of which is used for each attempt to start, and the short time that the motor is spun by each <b>cartridge.</b> Compressed-air <b>starters,</b> which use the same type of motor, are usually recharged by an engine-driven compressor, negating the need to carry cartridges, but adding requirements for the compressor and air tank. Hybrid systems can be made simply by adding a cartridge breech or an air tank to an existing system. Air tanks can also be recharged from an external source in an emergency, such as a hand pump or a portable air compressor.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, the X-1 {{removed the}} entire start tank system and {{replaced}} it with a small solid fuel rocket engine that fed its exhaust through the gas generator to spin the turbopumps. This change dramatically simplified engine plumbing, at the cost of making the design a single-shot device. Earlier engines could, in theory, be restarted in flight, but with a single <b>starter</b> <b>cartridge,</b> the X-1 could be started once only.|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} of the Chipmunk makes heavy use of metal, {{the majority of the}} airframe being composed of a stress-skinned alloy; this allowed the adoption of thinner wings and consequently provided for increased performance as well as a greater degree of durability. Numerous features were incorporated in order for the type to better perform in its trainer role, including hand-operated single-slotted wing flaps, anti-spin strakes, disc brakes on the wheeled undercarriage, a thin propeller composed of a solid lightweight alloy, the adoption of an engine-driven vacuum pump in place of external venture tubes to power cockpit instrumentation, electric and Coffman <b>cartridge</b> engine <b>starters</b> as alternative options, cockpit lighting, onboard radio system, and an external identification light underneath the starboard wing.|$|R
5|$|Pretending {{their client}} was the {{government}} of Pakistan, the Zoio brothers contacted a licensed arms dealer from England, Major WRL Turp MBE of Bexley, Kent, who quickly agreed in principle, requesting a letter of credit from a Geneva bank and appropriate end-user certificates for the weapons. Meanwhile, Reedman's military attaché, Wing Commander John Mussell, travelled to Belgium to buy <b>starter</b> <b>cartridges</b> for the Rolls-Royce Avon 109 jet engines used by the Royal Rhodesian Air Force's English Electric Canberra bombers, as well as engines for Rhodesia's Hawker Hunter jet fighters, which were produced in Belgium under licence from Britain.|$|R
50|$|Just as {{the water}} {{supplies}} are exhausted, the Phoenix is completed. The first four startup attempts are unsuccessful, and Dorfmann panics when Towns wants {{to use one of}} the remaining <b>starter</b> <b>cartridges</b> just to clear the engine's cylinders. Dorfmann objects, but Towns ignores him and fires one cartridge with the ignition off. The next startup is successful. The men pull the Phoenix to a nearby hilltop and climb onto the wings. When Towns guns the engine, the Phoenix slides down the hill and along a lake bed before taking off. After the Phoenix lands at an oasis with a manned oil rig, the men celebrate and Towns and Dorfmann are reconciled.|$|R
25|$|Australia {{had been}} {{interested}} in the Canberra early on, which had led to the aircraft being named after the Australian capital city. Particular interest had at one time been expressed in a potential Rolls-Royce Tay powered version of the aircraft. The Government Aircraft Factories (GAF) locally assembled 48 for the Royal Australian Air Force. These aircraft were broadly similar to the British B.2. Changes included {{the adoption of a}} modified leading edge, increased fuel capacity and room for three <b>starter</b> <b>cartridges,</b> although in practice all three cartridges would sometimes fire, leading to the triple starter units being loaded singly. In addition, Australian built Canberras used a higher proportion of Australian and US sourced components.|$|R

In 1977 it became the Propellants, Explosives and Rocket Motor Establishment, Waltham Abbey, or PERME Waltham Abbey. As a research centre Waltham Abbey was responsible for military propellant and high explosives and expanded into the increasingly significant field of rocket propellants, solid and liquid {{and a range of}} specialised applications, e.g. 'snifters' for altering space vehicles direction when in flight, cartridges for firing aircraft ejector seats, engine and generator <b>starter</b> <b>cartridges</b> - these applications have been called 'a measured strong shove'. The rocket activity later extended to the production of rocket motors, including work on the Skylark project.|$|R

50|$|The pilot's cockpit was a {{sub-assembly}} {{bolted to}} the front of the spar, placing him level with the leading edge if the wing, the navigator was behind the centre section of the wing and the radio operator — separated from the navigator by his equipment — behind him. The navigator and radio operator entered through a door, which acted as a ladder when opened, in the starboard side with their seats being offset to port. The cameras were installed in the fuselage behind the radio operator. One of the Sturgeon's unfortunate failings was in placement of controls. The fire extinguisher switch was located next to the cockpit switches required for firing the engine <b>starter</b> <b>cartridges,</b> resulting in some inadvertent mishaps and some unintended hilarity for ground crews.|$|R
40|$|In modern medico-legal literature, only a {{small number}} of {{publications}} deal with fatal injuries from black powder guns. Most of them focus on the morphological features such as intense soot soiling, blast tattooing and burn effects in close-range shots or describe the wound ballistics of spherical lead bullets. Another kind of "unusual" and potentially lethal weapons are handguns destined for firing only blank <b>cartridges</b> such as <b>starter</b> and alarm pistols. The dangerousness of these guns is restricted to very close and contact range shots and results from the gas jet produced by the deflagration of the propellant. The present paper reports on a suicide committed with a muzzle-loading percussion pistol cal. 45. An unusually large stellate entrance wound was located in the precordial region, accompanied by an imprint mark from the ramrod and a faint greenish discoloration (apparently due to the formation of sulfhemoglobin). Autopsy revealed an oversized powder cavity, multiple fractures of the anterior thoracic wall as well as ruptures of the heart, the aorta, the left hepatic lobe and the diaphragm. In total, the zone of mechanical destruction had a diameter of approx. 15  cm. As there was no exit wound and no bullet lodged in the body, the injury was caused exclusively by the inrushing combustion gases of the propellant (black powder) comparable with the gas jet of a blank cartridge gun. In contact shots to ballistic gelatine using the suicide's pistol loaded with black powder but no projectile, the formation of a nearly spherical cavity could be demonstrated by means of a high-speed camera. The extent of the temporary cavity after firing with 5  g of black powder roughly corresponded to the zone of destruction found in the suicide's body...|$|R
