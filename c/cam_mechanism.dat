500|$|Crassulacean acid {{metabolism}} (CAM) is {{a mechanism}} adopted by cacti and other succulents {{to avoid the}} problems of the [...] C3 mechanism. In full CAM, the stomata open only at night, when temperatures and water loss are lowest. [...] enters the plant and is captured in the form of organic acids stored inside cells (in vacuoles). The stomata remain closed throughout the day, and photosynthesis uses only this stored [...] CAM uses water much more efficiently at the price of limiting the amount of carbon fixed from the atmosphere and thus available for growth. CAM-cycling is a less efficient system whereby stomata open in the day, just as in plants using the C3 mechanism. At night, or when the plant is short of water, the stomata close and the <b>CAM</b> <b>mechanism</b> is used to store [...] produced by respiration for use later in photosynthesis.

40|$|Abstract. The {{motion cycle}} chart of <b>cam</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of ATC was designed, the contour surface {{equation}} of globoidal indexing cam and the roller center trajectory equation of plane groove cam were established. Based {{on the idea}} of modular design and the SolidWorks, a CAD system of <b>cam</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of ATC was developed by using SolidWorks API and VC++ 6. 0. Then the assembly model was built under the circumstance of SolidWorks directly. Meanwhile, the movement of <b>cam</b> <b>mechanisms</b> was simulated so that the reasonableness of the design was verified...|$|R

This paper deals with wear <b>mechanisms</b> at <b>cam</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in its first part, then describes factors affecting the life and the last part deals with a methodology of durability testing. Hertz's contact theory {{is the basis for}} the pressure determination in the contact patch. By means of its value we get the relationship between surface hardness and required lifetime of the cam surface. This information is heading to determination of the materials suitable for the <b>cam</b> <b>mechanisms</b> production, and it is necessary taking into account the working conditions...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the {{criteria}} which represent {{the base of}} optimizing the <b>cam</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and also we perform the calculations for several types of mechanisms.

As it follows, we present the optimization calculations of the cam and flat rotation follower mechanisms, as well as the calculations for optimizing the <b>cam</b> <b>mechanisms</b> by circular groove followers’ help. For an easier interpretation of the results, we have visualized the obtained cam in AutoCAD according to the script files generated by a calculation program...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cam</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{are widely}} used in industry, in {{applications}} requiring quick-return and indexing motions. A current research effort at the Robotic Mechanical Systems Laboratory of McGill University's Centre for Intelligent Machines aims at the application of <b>cam</b> <b>mechanisms</b> as speed reducers. The accuracy required in these mechanisms is of the utmost importance, especially when cams are rotating at a high speed. In this thesis, the design for manufacturability of planar speed-reduction <b>cam</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is studied. In particular, the thesis focuses on a speed reducer with a rotating follower to couple shafts of parallel axes, termed planar Speed-o-Cam. Principles of the design for manufacturability are applied to Speed-o-Cam and a unified method for obtaining the optimum parameters satisfying the curvature constraints and pressure-angle bounds is developed. These two factors are relatively important because Numerically Controlled and Computer Numerically Controlled machine tools could be very sensitive to changes of curvature of the workpiece, especially when milling complex shapes {{such as those of}} cam plates. Cam-mechanism balancing is also studied because unbalance in a high-speed rotating element can cause severe vibrations and greatly affect the bearings and hence, the performance of the machine. This is done by not only adding counterweights, which unavoidably increase the weight and volume of the mechanism, but also by removing material...|$|R

50|$|Cam {{engines are}} {{two-stroke}}, rather than four-stroke. In a two-stroke engine, the {{forces on the}} piston act uniformly downwards, throughout the cycle. In a four-stroke engine, these forces reverse cyclically: in the induction phase, the piston is forced upwards, against the reduced induction depression. The simple <b>cam</b> <b>mechanism</b> only works with a force in one direction. In the first Michel engines, the cam had two surfaces, a main surface on which the pistons worked when running and another ring inside this that gave a desmodromic action to constrain the piston position during engine startup.|$|E
50|$|In {{a single}} dwell <b>Cam</b> <b>mechanism,</b> {{there are three}} motion {{functions}} that follow each other and then repeat: a dwell, a rise, and a return function. It is sometimes desired to use a Rise function such that its acceleration does not become zero at its end.

There are a number of functions that can provide these motion requirements. A double-harmonic function is a common example used for single dwell.|$|E

40|$|In constant-breadth <b>cam</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{closure of}} the higher {{kinematic}} pairs formed by the bilateral cam-follower contact is guaranteed by the geometry of both cam and follower. A study of the cam profile by means of its radius of curvature and the sliding velocities in the upper pair enables us to predict the correct functioning of the mechanism. This work presents the equations for calculating cam breadth when the translating follower is eccentric with an inclination, the radius of curvature of its profile and the sliding velocities of constant-breadth <b>cam</b> <b>mechanisms</b> with translating and oscillating followers. This study also analyses {{the influence of the}} angle of inclination and the offset of the flat-faced translating followers {{on the size of the}} cam and the kinematics of the mechanism. Numerical examples are given of constant-breadth cams obtained for distinct values of the mentioned parameters. Additionally, this paper describes the redesign of a cam of a conventional sewing machine and the new cam prototype, with a continuity of an order higher than the original profile, is included.

50|$|Most pistonless engines {{relying on}} cams, {{such as the}} Rand cam engine, use the <b>cam</b> <b>mechanism</b> to control the motion of sealing vanes. Combustion {{pressure}} against these vanes causes a vane carrier, separate from the cam, to rotate. In the Rand engine, the camshaft moves the vanes so {{that they have a}} varying length exposed and so enclose a combustion chamber of varying volume as the engine rotates. The work done in rotating the engine to cause this expansion is the thermodynamic work done by the engine and what causes the engine to rotate.|$|E
5000|$|Some firearms, {{like the}} AN-94, have [...] "hyperburst," [...] a feature in which rounds are fired in {{incredibly}} quick succession {{on the first}} two rounds (1800 rpm {{in the case of the}} AN-94). This supposedly improves armor-penetration capability. Hyperburst is performed by having the barrel slide back and receive another round in the chamber pulled by a pulley and is fired as the barrel slams at the bolt, when the first chambered round is fired when the sliding barrel is at rest, as opposed to a <b>cam</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the M16 design.|$|E
5000|$|The {{number of}} rounds fired {{in a burst}} is almost universally {{determined}} by a <b>cam</b> <b>mechanism</b> that trips the trigger mechanism for each shot in the burst. Some designs, as employed on the M16 series, will terminate the burst if the trigger is released before the burst is complete. Thus, {{the next time the}} trigger is pulled, the weapon will only fire one or two rounds. Other designs, such as the mechanism found on Heckler & Koch weapons, will reset the cam position. Thus, the next burst will still fire a full number of rounds.|$|E

The transmission {{is based on the}} layout of pure-rolling indexing <b>cam</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> for it is intended to elim-inate backlash and friction, which are the main drawbacks of gear transmissions. The design relies on a unified methodology for in-dexing <b>cam</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> whereby the same procedure is used to design planar, spherical, and spatial mechanisms. Two versions of the speed reducer, that we term Speed-o-Cam, are described here, namely, planar, to couple shafts of parallel axes, and spher-ical, to couple shafts of intersecting axes. By means of a cas-cade of two planar versions of Speed-o-Cam, moreover, coaxial shafts can be coupled. Moreover, contrary to other alternatives to gear transmissions, such as harmonic drives or epicyclic trans-missions, Speed-o-Cam caters to shafts with either parallel or in-tersecting axes; in the latter case, moreover, the angle at which the axes intersect can vary from 0 to 180 continuously. The de-sign with shaft axes at 0 leads to an internal cam, i. e., one with its axis external to the axes of the follower and the roller in con-tact; for shaft axes at 180, the design leads to an external cam, i. e., one with its axis lying between those of the follower and the roller in contact...|$|R
