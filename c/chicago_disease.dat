Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was utilized to explore overexpression of the MexXY-OprM efflux as the mechanism for this phenotype profile. Thirteen of 15 (87 %) randomly selected isolates had mexY gene expression levels of 5. 8 &ndash; 40. 8 -fold {{relative to the}} wild-type reference strain. While mexY overexpression was noted {{in the majority of}} isolates, other resistance mechanisms appear to contribute to the observed phenotypic profile of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa studied. Clinicians must understand not only the magnitude of difference in the MIC profiles between agents, but also the mechanism(s) responsible for these observations if strategies (ie, pharmacodynamic dosing) are to be designed to optimize patient care outcomes in the face of increasing resistance.

40|$|BackgroundChronic {{hypersensitivity}} pneumonitis (CHP) is a fibrotic parenchymal lung disease {{that occurs when}} inhalation of environmental antigens leads to immune dysregulation. Autoimmune features have recently been identified as potentially important among patients with CHP. However, the relationship between hypothyroidism (HT) and CHP is unknown. In this study, we investigate the prevalence and impact of HT among patients with CHP. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective, case–control analysis. We identified 121 patients at the University of <b>Chicago</b> Interstitial Lung <b>Disease</b> Center with a multidisciplinary diagnosis of CHP. These patients were matched 3 : 1 according to age, sex, and race to 363 control subjects with asthma from 2006 to 2015. We analyzed demographics, clinical characteristics, and survival between both groups and assessed the relationship of HT with CHP. Survival analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards modeling. ResultsPatients with CHP had higher prevalence of HT (25. 6 %, n[*]=[*] 31) compared to controls (10. 7 %, n[*]=[*] 39; OR, 2. 86; 95 % CI, 1. 62 – 4. 99; P[*]<[*] 0. 0001). Compared to CHP alone, patients with CHP/HT {{were more likely to}} be female (80. 6 vs 51. 1 %, P[*]=[*] 0. 004), have increased incidence of autoimmune disease (19. 4 vs 3. 3 %, P[*]=[*] 0. 009), antinuclear antibody seropositivity (80. 6 vs 57. 0 %, P[*]=[*] 0. 019), and higher TSH levels (4. 0 vs 1. 9 [*]mIU/L, P[*]<[*] 0. 0001). HT was a significant independent predictor of mortality among CHP patients with seropositive ANA (HR, 3. 39; 95 % CI, 1. 31 – 8. 80; P[*]=[*] 0. 012). ConclusionHT is common in patients with CHP and may carry prognostic significance in patients with features of autoimmunity. Further research exploring common pathogenic pathways between autoimmune HT and CHP may illuminate the association of HT with survival...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{association}} between neighborhood social disorganization and coronary heart disease (CHD). This study used the theoretical frameworks of the Chicago school and the Stirling County group in order to analyze the impact of neighborhood violent crime and neighborhood unemployment on CHD in an urban setting, the capital of Sweden. The entire population of Stockholm County aged 35 - 64 years on January 1, 1998 was included in the study. All individuals were followed for CHD until December 31, 1998. Small area neighborhood units were used to define neighborhoods. The neighborhood-level variables were calculated as rates of violent crime or unemployment in the small area neighborhood units, categorized in quintiles. Multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and neighborhood-level variance in three different models. When rates of neighborhood violent crime or neighborhood unemployment increased, the risk of CHD increased among both women and men. In neighborhoods with the highest rates of violent crime (quintile 5), the odds ratios were 1. 75 (CI= 1. 37 - 2. 22) and 1. 39 (CI= 1. 19 - 1. 63) for women and men, respectively. In neighborhoods with the highest unemployment rates, the corresponding odds ratios were 2. 05 (CI= 1. 62 - 2. 59) and 1. 50 (CI= 1. 28 - 1. 75). These average neighborhood effects on CHD (fixed effects) remained almost unaltered after inclusion of the individual-level variables. The neighborhood-level variance indicated significant differences in CHD between neighborhoods, and the neighborhood-level and individual-level variables partly explained the variance between neighborhoods (random effects). Public safety and social stability in socially disorganized neighborhoods need to be improved in order to promote cardiovascular health.
