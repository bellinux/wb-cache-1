25|$|The above {{principles}} can be {{used for}} pairing wines with Asian cuisine. Pair for the flavor of the dish - whatever the 'main ingredient' may be - it is not the meat, seafood, or vegetables that stand out as the predominant flavor. Rather the true flavor of the dish is determined by the cooking method (for example, the toasty flavors of a stir fry), the sauce (from curries to sweet-and-sour), the use of seasonings (such as ginger and <b>coriander</b> <b>leaves</b> to mask fishy tastes), or the blending of ingredients to for new flavors (as in sukiyaki or satay). Indeed, it may result from a combination of any of these elements. Also, note {{that in the case of}} an Asian meal, several dishes are served at the same time and are shared by everyone present. The wine chosen for such a meal has to be versatile.|$|E

40|$|Amla fruit {{can range}} upto 950 mg/ 100 g which {{is said to}} be highest among all fruits next only to Barbados cherry. Being very {{astringent}} in taste it can not be consumed as raw by the consumer hence processing became essential. Present study was an effort to develop commercially acceptable ready to eat green Amla chutney. To optimize the quantity of pulps and salts to be added, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used. Statistical software Stat-Ease was used for statistical and graphical analysis of the experimental data. To consider all the responses simultaneously for optimization the RSM was used to compromise optimum conditions and {{it was found that the}} sensory scores were 7. 35, 7. 8 and 7. 75 for color, flavor and overall acceptability corresponding to optimum conditions. Chutney having composition Amla pulp- 65. 59 %, salt - 8 %, green chilli- 3. 31 %, garlic paste- 2. 11 % and <b>coriander</b> <b>leave</b> paste 18. 89 % was found optimum. Triplicates samples were prepared using the optimum conditions and were evaluated for all the responses, corresponding values for color flavor and overall acceptability were 7. 91, 8. 08 and 8. 08 which were comparatively higher than the predicted value. Therefore, the said formulations were recommended for ready to eat chutney. For the preservation of Amla chutney, salt concentration was varied from 8 to 12 % while Brix were varied from 20 to 50 °B. REC having 25 °B had only 10 days of shelf life while chutney of 35 °B could be stored upto twenty days at refrigeration temperature. Chutney having 50 °B could be stored up to two months without any significant change in the quality attributes of the chutney...|$|R
