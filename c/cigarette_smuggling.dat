25|$|The 1950s and 1960s were {{difficult}} {{times for the}} mafia, but in the 1970s their rackets grew considerably more lucrative, particularly smuggling. The most lucrative racket of the 1970s was <b>cigarette</b> <b>smuggling.</b> Sicilian and Neapolitan crime bosses negotiated a joint monopoly over the smuggling of cigarettes to Naples.|$|E
25|$|To fund its campaign, the IRA was {{allegedly}} involved in criminal {{activities such as}} robberies, counterfeiting, protection rackets, kidnapping for ransom, fuel laundering and <b>cigarette</b> <b>smuggling.</b> The IRA also raised funds through donations and by running legitimate businesses such as taxi firms, social clubs, pubs and restaurants.

25|$|His forced {{retirement}} as town councillor of Mussomeli, {{his arrest}} {{and years of}} confinement initiated the decline of Genco Russo’s power.

25|$|The Croatian Journalists' Association has {{announced}} that the murder {{is the first of}} a journalist in Croatia since the nation's War of Independence. Pukanić has been known as a controversial figure, with close ties to the underworld and to politicians. Croatian media has reported he was a regular guest at all receptions given by president Stjepan Mesić. Pukanić's Nacional was known for uncovering <b>cigarette</b> <b>smuggling</b> schemes involving, among others, a Swiss-based Serbian tycoon Stanko Subotić and the current Prime Minister of Montenegro, Milo Đukanović. Italian Prosecutor Giuseppe Scelsi said that Ivo Pukanić and the murdered Montenegrin journalist Duško Jovanović of Dan, were among the most important witnesses in the investigation and that the Antimafia Commission will now have to archive the case. Another reason for archiving the investigation is the diplomatic immunity of Milo Đukanović.|$|E
40|$|Although <b>smuggled</b> <b>cigarettes</b> {{have been}} a {{prevalent}} problem and a severe challenge to public health and welfare around the world, {{little is known about}} the behavior associated with smoking <b>smuggled</b> <b>cigarettes</b> and the issue is difficult to study due to data limitations. By means of a population-based tobacco survey conducted in Taiwan, the present paper applies a latent class model to identify potential smokers who are either currently or will at some point in the future be consuming <b>smuggled</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> This methodology, in contrast to the traditional discrete models, allows potential smokers who are more inclined to smoke <b>smuggled</b> <b>cigarettes</b> to be endogenously classified. The empirical results indicate that socio-demographic factors do increase the inclination to smoke <b>smuggled</b> <b>cigarettes</b> after unobserved heterogeneity has been accounted for...|$|R
40|$|Background: This study {{analysed}} the socio-economic {{factors that}} influence a smokers decision to consume <b>smuggled</b> <b>cigarettes</b> {{when faced with the}} rising costs of legal cigarettes. We hope our findings will help public health authorities create policies that simultaneously discourage consumption of <b>smuggled</b> <b>cigarettes</b> and lower overall smoking levels. Methods: We conducted a national telephone survey from April to June 2004. We then applied Multiple Logistic Regression to the collected data to answer the following questions: do socio-economically disadvantaged smokers differ significantly in their characteristics If so, which characteristics are most influential in the decision to purchase <b>smuggled</b> <b>cigarettes</b> Results: Smokers with a personal monthly income of less than New Taiwan dollar (NT) 10 000 are 24 more likely to smoke <b>smuggled</b> <b>cigarettes</b> than are smokers who earn NT 10 000 or more. Smokers with the least amount of education are 21 more likely to smoke <b>smuggled</b> <b>cigarettes</b> than those with higher levels of education. Smokers with the most experience purchasing <b>smuggled</b> <b>cigarettes</b> are 31 more likely to do so than those with less experience. Finally, smokers who have a personal monthly income of less than NT 10 000 and the least amount of education are 54 more likely to smoke <b>smuggled</b> <b>cigarettes</b> than those with just oneor noneof these characteristics. Conclusion: Low-income, poorly-educated smokers are most likely to purchase <b>smuggled</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> To alter such behaviour, government must understand the motivations and opinions of this population and create marketing messages targeted specifically to their needs...|$|R

25|$|On March 10, 1993, Bresciano {{was found}} shot dead. He was 44 years old. He {{was hit by}} 17 bullets, 7 to the head and 10 to the torso, while {{watching}} hockey in his Vimont, Laval, Quebec home. His alleged role in illegal <b>cigarette</b> <b>smuggling</b> in Canada is popularly believed to have led to his officially unsolved murder. Colleague Rick Martel has stated that because of Bresciano's notoriety from being a popular professional wrestler, {{he was able to}} attract many customers (particularly natives), thus crossing the Mafia. According to former opponent Bret Hart, Bresciano confided to friends shortly before his death that he knew his days were numbered. He was a nephew by marriage of Montreal crime boss Vic Cotroni, and was believed by authorities to be involved in his organization for some time. Bresciano's remains are in a mausoleum at Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal, Quebec.|$|E
25|$|He {{learned that}} the chemists of the French Connection had moved clandestine labs for {{refining}} heroin from Marseilles to Sicily. At the end of 1980 he visited the United States and started {{to work with the}} U.S. Justice Department, resulting in “some of the biggest international law enforcement operations in history” such as the Pizza Connection. The inquiries extended to Turkey, an important stopover on the route of morphine base; to Switzerland, where bank secrecy laws facilitated money laundering; and to Naples where <b>cigarette</b> <b>smuggling</b> rings were being reconfigured as heroin operations. At the end of 1981, he finalised the Spatola case for trial, which enabled the prosecution to win 74 convictions, based on Falcone's “web of solid evidence, bank and travel records, seized heroin shipments, fingerprint and handwriting analyses, wiretapped conversations and firsthand testimony” that proved that “Sicily had replaced France as the principal gateway for refining and exporting heroin to the United States”.|$|E
500|$|... "When I die, the Mafia dies," [...] Vizzini {{once told}} Montanelli. However, {{with the death}} of Vizzini his old-fashioned {{traditional}} rural Mafia slowly passed away to be replaced with a more modern, often urban version of gangsterism involved in <b>cigarette</b> <b>smuggling,</b> drug trafficking and laundering their proceeds in construction and real-estate development. While still alive and after his death Vizzini’s stature as an all powerful Mafia boss rose to mythical proportions. Since the 1990s historians have moderated his magnitude.|$|E
50|$|Cutolo {{insisted that}} if other {{criminal}} groups {{wanted to keep}} their business, they had to pay the NCO protection on all their activities, including a percentage for each carton of <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smuggled</b> into Naples.

5000|$|Bulgartabac {{has been}} linked by Turkish Customs {{officials}} to {{a significant role in}} the production and illegal import of “cheap whites” - substandard <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smuggled</b> in through Iran and Syria to avoid taxation or safety quality standards. Allegedly “They are shipped through the Suez Canal and Red Sea, around the Gulf of Aden and up to Jebel Ali, the transit point. Once there, the tobacco is usually disguised as another product and given fresh paperwork before being shipped onwards to Iraq, where it is smuggled back across the border into Turkey without paying excise duty.” ...|$|R
40|$|Does {{smuggling}} {{negate the}} impact of a tobacco tax increase? The tobacco industry claims that increases in tobacco tax will not discourage people from smoking because smokers will simply substitute taxed <b>cigarettes</b> with <b>smuggled</b> untaxed <b>cigarettes.</b> 1 The experi-ence in Hong Kong suggests that <b>smuggled</b> <b>cigarettes</b> are eating into some of the taxed cigarette market share, as the industry suggests. However, despite this increase in the illicit market, higher tobacco tax does effectively reduce total tobacco consumption...|$|R
2500|$|During the {{invasion}} of Iraq, Basra was the first city to fall to Coalition forces, following two weeks of fighting between the British and Iraqi forces. Following {{the collapse of the}} Iraqi government, a number of Shi'ite Islamist groups, including the Sadrist Trend led by Muqtada al-Sadr, the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council and Fadhila, were able to expand their influence in Basra, solidifying their standing following the January 2005 elections. Basra became a center of smuggling activity in Iraq, including <b>cigarette</b> <b>smuggling,</b> opium from Afghanistan which transits Iran, oil and gas smuggling, illegal weapons, and other criminal rackets. Violence steadily increased as the three parties vied for control of Basra's resources, continuing through 2005 and 2006. At the same time, attacks on British forces increased following the use of highly sophisticated explosively formed penetrators (EFPs) smuggled in by Iran [...] restricting the British to their bases, which militia then targeted with rocket and mortar fire on a regular basis. The Mahdi Army also enforced strict Islamic rule in Basra, threatening women for wearing makeup and punishing individuals for playing secular Western and Arabic music.|$|E
