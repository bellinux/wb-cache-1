5|$|By now aged nearly 56, Kruger {{resolved}} that {{he could}} no longer travel constantly between Boekenhoutfontein and the capital, and in August 1881 he and Gezina moved to Church Street, Pretoria, from where he could easily walk to the government offices on Church Square. Also around this time he shaved off his moustache and most of his facial hair, leaving the <b>chinstrap</b> beard he kept thereafter. His and Gezina's permanent home on Church Street, what is now called Kruger House, would be completed in 1884.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} marine animals exist and rely, {{directly}} or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes penguins, blue whales, orcas, colossal squids and fur seals. The emperor penguin {{is the only}} penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the Adélie penguin breeds farther south than any other penguin. The southern rockhopper penguin has distinctive feathers around the eyes, giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes. King penguins, <b>chinstrap</b> penguins, and gentoo penguins also breed in the Antarctic.|$|E
5|$|The island's {{vegetation}} consists exclusively of {{mosses and lichens}} {{which have}} adapted to the extreme Antarctic climate. The island has a very harsh climate with strong winds and freezing temperatures. The steady snowfall keeps vegetation to a minimum. The island is {{a breeding ground for}} a few seabirds, particularly southern fulmars, but also Wilson's storm petrels and Antarctic terns. Penguins, including Adélie and <b>chinstrap</b> penguins, visit the island infrequently. There are numerous seals, particularly crabeater seals, leopard seals and smaller numbers of southern elephant seals.|$|E
50|$|Another {{difference}} of the M1C was the <b>chinstraps</b> (this was {{seen on the}} M2). The <b>chinstraps</b> found on the M2 and M1C both had a button snap on the end {{so as to be}} fastened to the liner.|$|R
50|$|All wigs and {{headpieces}} {{had to have}} <b>chinstraps</b> added.|$|R

25|$|A silver <b>chinstrap</b> {{positioned}} {{above his}} peaked cap on his headdress, replacing a black <b>chinstrap.</b>|$|E
25|$|It has a cap band {{which may}} be {{coloured}} (red for all Royal Regiments and Corps), a crown (formerly khaki, now dark blue, except for Military Police which has always been red, and the Rifles who wear Rifle Green) which may have coloured piping or a regimental/corps colour and a patent leather peak and <b>chinstrap.</b> The <b>chinstrap</b> is usually secured above and across the peak and secured at each end by a small (20 line) button of the appropriate regimental or corps pattern.|$|E
25|$|On both {{navy and}} army caps, the <b>chinstrap</b> is {{affixed to the}} cap via two small buttons, one roughly over each ear; these buttons are {{miniature}} versions of the buttons on the service dress tunic, and as such bear an RCN or regimental device.|$|E
50|$|Early M-36s {{were made}} with fragile leather linings. Due to the {{unreliability}} of these early models containing leather linings, later variations were introduced with cloth linings. Similar problems were also encountered with early leather <b>chinstraps,</b> so the leather <b>chinstraps</b> were phased {{out in favor of}} cloth models as well. Throughout their production four sizes were produced: small, medium, large, and extra large.|$|R
50|$|Second pattern, {{came with}} the same leather <b>chinstraps</b> and a steel rim instead of the fibre rim (issue October 1942).|$|R
50|$|The {{predator}} {{of adult}} <b>chinstraps</b> is the leopard seal. Eggs and chicks can {{fall prey to}} birds, such as the sheathbill and the brown skua.|$|R
25|$|On navy caps, {{the peak}} and <b>chinstrap</b> {{of the service}} cap are always black. The cap band is black with the {{exception}} of navy military police, who wear a scarlet cap band, and members of Canadian Special Operations Forces Command, who wear a tan cap band.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} marine animals exist and rely, {{directly}} or indirectly, on the phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean. Antarctic sea life includes penguins, blue whales, orcas, colossal squids and fur seals. The emperor penguin {{is the only}} penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the Adélie penguin breeds farther south than any other penguin. The rockhopper penguin has distinctive feathers around the eyes, giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes. King penguins, <b>chinstrap</b> penguins, and gentoo penguins also breed in the Antarctic.|$|E
25|$|The Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps—the {{two small}} services, {{consisting}} only of officers, {{which are the}} two uniformed services that are not armed forces—wear uniforms and rank insignia adopted from the Navy. The combination covers of the two services are identical {{to those of the}} Navy with respect to colors, and peak ornamentation. The <b>chinstrap</b> of the PHS is gold with a burgundy stripe. The buttons securing the chin strap to the sides of the band are smaller versions of the buttons worn on the services' uniform coats. The cap device of NOAACC officers {{is similar to that of}} Navy officers with a globe in place of the shield; the cap device of PHSCC officers is similar to that of Navy officers but has a caduceus in place of one of the anchors.|$|E
50|$|The {{station is}} near colonies of three {{different}} types of Pygoscelis penguins (Adelies, <b>chinstraps,</b> and gentoos), and has been designated a site of Special Scientific Interest (SSI) as provided by the Antarctic Treaty.|$|R
50|$|The islands {{has been}} {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because they support breeding colonies of several penguin species, including Adélies (800 pairs), <b>chinstraps</b> (9400 pairs) and gentoos (3500 pairs).|$|R
5000|$|... "I don't mind if I do" [...] - Colonel Humphrey <b>Chinstrap's</b> catchphrase, {{spoken by}} Jack Train, turning any remark into {{an offer of}} a drink. The origin of this catchphrase precedes ITMA, but was {{nevertheless}} popularised by ITMA.|$|R
25|$|The United States Coast Guard {{wears the}} {{combination}} cap, {{known as the}} combo cover, with the Service Dress Blue uniform (SDBs), the Tropical Blue Long uniform (Trops), and with all other formal dress uniforms. The cover is identical {{to that of the}} navy with respect to the <b>chinstrap</b> and peak ornamentation. Its crown is white. The buttons securing the chin strap to the sides of the band are smaller versions of the buttons worn on the Coast Guard's uniform coats. The blue band around the cap includes blue fabric extending upward {{on the front of the}} crown to serve as a backing behind the device. In the case of enlisted personnel, this extension is a blue circle identical to that on the caps of Naval officers and chief petty officers. In the case of commissioned officers, however, the extension is a more elaborate polygon to accommodate the officers' cap device.|$|E
25|$|While the {{majority}} of American merchant mariners are employed by shipping businesses and accordingly wear either uniforms prescribed by their employers or civilian attire, some officers receive commissions in the United States Maritime Service for federal government duty, such as {{the faculty of the}} United States Merchant Marine Academy and the Military Sealift Command's civilian officers manning non-commissioned United States Naval Ships. These officers wear uniforms and rank insignia adopted from the U.S. Navy, albeit with United States Merchant Marine's own button design, cap device, awards, and decorations. The combination covers these officers are identical to those of naval officer with respect to colors, <b>chinstrap</b> and peak ornamentation. The buttons securing the chin strap to the sides of the band are smaller versions of the buttons worn on their coats. The USMS cap device is a rendering of the Merchant Marine device in gold- and silver-colored metal. Like the device worn by naval officers, it features a silver eagle, with wings outstretched, above a gold shield; the shield, however, is defaced with an anchor and surrounded by a wreath.|$|E
25|$|The {{island has}} been {{designated}} as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its importance as {{a breeding ground for}} seabirds. In 1978–79 there were an estimated 117,000 breeding penguins on the island, consisting of macaroni penguin and, to a lesser extent, <b>chinstrap</b> penguin and Adélie penguin, although these were only estimated to be 62,000 in 1989–90. Nyrøysa is the most important colony for penguins, supplemented by Posadowskybreen, Kapp Circoncision, Norvegiaodden and across from Larsøya. Southern fulmar {{is by far the most}} common non-penguin bird with 100,000 individuals. Other breeding seabirds consist of Cape petrel, Antarctic prion, Wilson's storm petrel, black-bellied storm petrel, subantarctic skua, southern giant petrel, snow petrel, slender-billed prion and Antarctic tern. Kelp gull is thought to have bred on the island earlier. Non-breeding birds which can be found on the island include the king penguin, wandering albatross, black-browed albatross, Campbell albatross, Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross, sooty albatross, light-mantled albatross, northern giant petrel, Antarctic petrel, blue petrel, soft-plumaged petrel, Kerguelen petrel, white-headed petrel, fairy prion, white-chinned petrel, great shearwater, common diving petrel, south polar skua and parasitic jaeger.|$|E
50|$|German {{military}} Pickelhauben also mounted two round, colored cockades {{behind the}} <b>chinstraps</b> {{attached to the}} sides of the helmet. The right cockade, the national cockade, was red, black and white. The left cockade was used to denote the state of the soldier (Prussia-black and white; Bavaria-white and blue; etc.).|$|R
2500|$|Enlisted airmen's <b>chinstraps</b> and visors are {{of plain}} black leather or polymer material. All {{commissioned}} officers' <b>chinstraps</b> are also of plain black leather or polymer material. The visors of company-grade officers (second lieutenant through captain) are plain black leather or polymer material. Field-grade officers' visors have {{two pairs of}} clouds and lightning bolts, patterned after the oak leaf motifs used by the other services. General officers' caps add an extra pair of clouds and bolts on the visor, while the cap of the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force adds clouds and bolts around the entire cap band. The clouds and bolts are jokingly referred to in military slang as [...] "farts and darts", much as the other services' oak leaf motifs are known as [...] "scrambled eggs".|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the 2014 US season, LFL {{unveiled}} new helmets by Bauer, designed with a harder outer shell and more padding than the CCM helmets used the past 4 years. They are still equipped with the concussion meters. <b>Chinstraps,</b> while still by Russell, are thicker and have more padding.|$|R
25|$|The kepi was {{formerly}} {{the most common}} headgear in the French Army. Its predecessor originally appeared during the 1830s, {{in the course of}} the initial stages of the occupation of Algeria, as a series of various lightweight cane-framed cloth undress caps called casquette d'Afrique. These were intended as alternatives to the heavier, cloth-covered leather French Army shako. As a light and comfortable headdress, it was adopted by the metropolitan (French mainland) infantry regiments for service and daily wear, with the less practical shako being relegated to parade use. In 1852, a new soft cloth cap was introduced for campaign and off-duty. Called bonnet de police à visière, this was the first proper model of the kepi. The visor was generally squarish in shape and oversized and was referred to as bec de canard (duck bill). This kepi had no <b>chinstrap</b> (jugulaire). Subsequent designs reduced the size of the cap and introduced chinstraps and buttons. The kepi became well known outside France during the Crimean War and was subsequently adopted in various forms by a number of other armies (including the U.S. and Russian) during the 1860s and 1870s.|$|E
25|$|The Service Dress Blue (SDB) uniform {{consists}} of a navy blue suit coat and trousers (or the optional skirt for women) that are nearly black in color, a white shirt, and a four-in-hand necktie for men or a neck tab for women. The material is generally wool or a wool blend, depending on the vendor. The men's jacket is double breasted with six gold-colored buttons, and the women's jacket has a single row of four gold-colored buttons. Rank insignia is the gold sleeve stripes for commissioned officers, while rating badges and service stripes are worn on the left sleeve by Chief Petty Officers (CPOs). The prescribed headgear is the white combination cap, although a navy blue garrison cap is optional, unless stated otherwise by the prescribing authority in some situations when the jacket is not worn. Beginning in 2016, the Navy began phasing out the female combination cap and now prescribes a cover similar to the male version for female officers and CPOs. Commissioned and warrant officers wear a cap badge of the American shield and eagle in silver upon gold crossed anchors; CPOs wear a single fouled anchor. The combination cover's <b>chinstrap</b> is gold for commissioned and warrant officers, narrower gold for midshipmen, and black for CPOs. Female officers and chief petty officers wear beltless slacks with the SDB, although since January 2017, belted slacks can be worn as an alternative.|$|E
25|$|Broadcast 2 December 1993, this {{instalment}} {{looks at}} the summer, when almost all life in the region breeds. A South Georgian colony of fur seals is shown: the pups grow fast on the rich, fatty milk provided by their mothers and double their weight in just sixty days. As the females become sexually available, the mating season begins — males try to claim territory and mate with females. <b>Chinstrap</b> penguins form large groups on Deception Island, climbing up its steep slopes to find mountain ridges free of snow. Returning birds find their partners by recognising their voice (performing a brief greeting ritual when they find them), {{which is why the}} colonies are very noisy during the breeding season. Males and females take turns in catching food, some of which they later regurgitate for their chicks. The summer also thaws some of the ice on the continent's shores. The fresh water allows moss and other plants to grow, which in turn provide food for mites that are adapted to the cold climate — they can survive temperatures up to minus 30°C because they contain a kind of antifreeze. They become active as soon as the ice melts, and reproduce whenever they get an opportunity to do so. Lichens grow even further south than moss, and algae populate some of the snow. In the ocean, life is much more diverse, and blue-eyed shags dive for fish near the peninsula. More than 300,000 petrels come to breed to the Scullin Monolith, one of the few areas of open rock.|$|E
50|$|Imperial - The {{sector in}} which the Imperial Palace and the Galactic Library lie. When Seldon first visited Trantor to deliver his speech at the Decennial Convention, fashion in the sector called for bold, bright colors and wearing hats without <b>chinstraps.</b> According to Asimov, many of the {{inhabitants}} of this sector were tall Northerner yellowhairs, implying that they were people {{of what we call}} Nordic ancestry.|$|R
50|$|University of Oklahoma American {{football}} {{line coach}} Bill Michael liked to recruit players from Elmore. He personally recruited Elmore student Greg Pruitt. According to Pruitt, at Elmore athletes {{had a high}} status and the school had a tradition of winning athletic games. According to Pruitt football players signaled that they played the game by putting <b>chinstraps</b> in their back pockets, causing them to attract females.|$|R
2500|$|The {{regulations}} were often ignored {{because of the}} scarcity of materials {{and the need for}} rapid production. The average Confederate kepi usually was a simple gray or butternut cap made of wool or jean wool. To save leather for shoes and accoutrements, by mid-war Confederate kepi brims often were made of tarred cloth; <b>chinstraps</b> were sometimes omitted. [...] Many Confederate units wore unique versions of the kepi. These included: ...|$|R
500|$|Some {{sixty years}} prior to the series, Avatar Aang and Fire Lord Zuko founded the United Republic of Nations, and its capital Republic City. In the {{following}} years, Aang married Katara and they have three children: Bumi [...] (named for Aang's old friend), Kya (after Katara's deceased mother), and Tenzin. In his adult years, Aang grew a neatly cropped <b>chinstrap</b> beard, which many statues of Aang's adult form depict him with, including the one in the restored Southern Air Temple. He also founded the Air Acolytes, a sect who eschewed their home cultures in favor of following the Air Nomads' way of life (the comics reveal that the first Air Acolytes were the reorganized Avatar Fan Club). [...] A forty-year-old Aang assisted Toph in arresting Water Tribe crime lord Yakone. As Aang watched the trial where Yakone was convicted of using the rare and illegal technique Bloodbending, Yakone tried to escape Republic City, using his unique abilities to subdue everyone in the court room, thus leaving them unconscious. Able to resist Yakone's Bloodbending through the Avatar State, Aang used his Energybending abilities to put a halt to Yakone's plans.|$|E
2500|$|In the 3rd Test between England and West Indies at Old Trafford on 9 June 2007, Kevin Pietersen was out [...] "hit wicket" [...] {{when his}} helmet {{fell onto the}} stumps.

50|$|The LKp S-101 Luftwaffe Flying Helmet made by Siemens for the Luftwaffe. The 101 {{model is}} similar to the leather 100 model and was {{improved}} with brownish-grey flecked material lined with grey-green satin. Oval fleece cushions are fitted inside the helmet, over the ears, with plastic inserts tucked inside. Goggle straps and <b>chinstraps</b> are made of leather. The hard rubber ear cups are covered with dark brown leather and feature the ridge for goggle retention.|$|R
50|$|Some modelers, who {{are happy}} {{to go that far}} and have the {{material}} available, will remove and sculpt certain parts of the figure.This is usually motivated by lack of poses. For example, new arms may be sculpted on to turn an infantryman pose into an artilleryman pose, but a step like this is quite extravagant and most people who need to sculpt to convert will do so with small details such as buttons or <b>chinstraps.</b> Sometimes a figure is converted to improve its historical accuracy.|$|R
50|$|The M76 helmet {{has been}} issued since the Falklands war, {{replacing}} the World War II era Helmet Steel Airborne Troop. The first variants {{were made from}} fibreglass, offering less protection than the Mk6 combat helmet. It also first came with vinyl/leather chinstraps; these were prone to wear, but later replaced with the previous but durable webbing <b>chinstraps</b> from the HSAT, which would later come in green webbing with a black leather chin pad. Later variants came with improved ballistic protection found on the Mk6 which are still in use today. The liner is made from polystyrene with cork ear sections, removable for installing earphones etc.|$|R
