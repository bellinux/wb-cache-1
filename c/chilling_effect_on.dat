30|$|The {{involvement}} of private companies raises {{a number of}} issues, related {{to the concept of}} governance by and of platforms (Gillespie 2017). On the one hand, SM platforms have acquired responsibility in terms of content regulation: especially since States cannot police or regulate contents on SM companies without their collaboration (Gillespie 2017). However, delegating or imposing policing power on private companies (i.e. governance by platforms) comes with the risk of subordinating security to the for-profit agenda of capitalist companies. This creates issues in terms of democratic legitimacy and the possible <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> human rights, especially with regard to the quality of communication and the management of users’ data by these companies (see Cambridge Analytica). On the other hand, too much State governance of platforms risks abuse and ultimately <b>chilling</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> freedom of expression (i.e. NSA state surveillance) (United Nations and Kaye 2016).|$|R

Chlorophyll fluorescence analysis in dark-adapted leaves showed less damage in cv Z 7 than in cv Penjalinan during recovery from the chilling treatment.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of the computer has revolutionized communications, allowing quick dissemination of information to large numbers of people. Information transmitted electronically is often safeguarded through a widely available method known as encryption, which renders the information unintelligible to anyone without the ability to decrypt the message. Law enforcement agencies argue that unregulated encryption hinders their ability to prevent crime by providing criminals with a method of communication that cannot be accessed by police departments and government agencies. Proponents of encryption argue that privacy, security, and constitutional concerns outweigh law enforcement 2 ̆ 7 s fears, guaranteeing {{the ability to communicate}} confidentially. In 1994, the government adopted a new encryption standard that arguably alleviated the risks underlying confidential communications. This Note will argue that although voluntary, this action was a failed attempt at controlling encryption, and that as a result, the federal government will propose a mandatory encryption scheme. Under traditional First Amendment jurisprudence, such a scheme resembles a content-neutral time, place, and manner restriction, and courts will have to balance the competing interests involved.

40|$|Recent European Union {{sustainability}} {{criteria for}} biofuels {{provide an opportunity}} to understand more precisely the relationship between national sustainable development policies and World Trade Organization (WTO) law. A desire to avoid WTO conflict was one reason for the omission of stronger criteria addressing negative social and environmental impacts of increased biofuels production. Thus, despite declarations of sustainable development’s central importance in WTO legal texts and statements by the Secretariat, national sustainability regulations risked trade law conflict. This article documents potential reasons for a WTO regulatory <b>chill</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the sustainability criteria. It then outlines challenges that the regulatory concept poses to trade law, which result primarily from its breadth and complexity, as well as the lack of targeted international standards, and its emphasis on production processes which intrude heavily, in an extraterritorial sense, on importers. It is important to identify these limitations to the mutual supportiveness between trade liberalization and national policies to achieve sustainability goals. However, despite these limitations, the case study also suggests that, with regard to sustainability criteria, sustainable development’s soft power as a WTO legal principle is an important source of influence...|$|R
40|$|Advocates of {{antidumping}} (AD) laws downplay {{their negative}} effects {{by arguing that}} the trade flows that are subject to AD are small and their distortions negligible. But while the adverse <b>effect</b> of AD <b>on</b> product-level trade has long been established, the question remains whether there are trade effects at the aggregate level. The recent proliferation wave of AD laws and their use provides us with a unique policy change to estimate the true trade effects of adopting and enforcing AD laws. For this purpose, we estimate the <b>effect</b> of AD <b>on</b> bilateral trade flows between the "new adopters" of AD laws and their trade partners. Using a gravity model of annual observations (1980 - 2000) our estimates show that AD has trade <b>chilling</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> aggregate import volumes but the impacts are heterogeneous across sectors. We find that new tough users experience a chilling of their aggregate imports of 14 billion US$ a year (or 5. 9 %) {{as a result of}} AD measures. For some countries like Mexico and India, the dampening effects of AD laws on trade flows are found to substantially offset the increase in trade volumes derived from trade liberalization.

40|$|Although {{the term}} “anti-counterfeiting” {{suggests}} an agreement limited to preventing trade in counterfeit products, ACTA’s draft provisions, to date, would set new minimum enforcement standards {{for a range}} of intellectual property rights. In several areas, these standards could impede legitimate competition, shortchange legal process and shift costs of enforcing private commercial rights to the public. The parties to ACTA have agreed to narrow some of its provisions in recent months. Despite these improvements to its text, ACTA continues to present risks for global access to medicines, including potentially restricting free transit of generics, imposing <b>chilling</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> the medicines trade, and limiting flexibilities in intellectual property (IP) rules. The parties have cited protecting consumers from unsafe products as a primary benefit of ACTA. But among IP infringements, only willful trademark counterfeiting of potentially dangerous classes of products poses a categorical public safety risk. Outside the context of counterfeiting, IP infringement analysis is not related to health. Moreover, ACTA diverts attention and resources away from more direct and comprehensive public safety measures. ACTA’s most significant public health costs may come from its narrative positioning and precedent. ACTA does not adequately distinguish between criminal activity and civil infringements occurring in the context of market competition—a problem that concerns consumer groups and intellectual property owners alike. Several parties to ACTA now rightly suggest narrowing the agreement’s scope altogether. Public health analysis leads to the conclusion that ACTA should be scaled back to cover only willful commercial scale trademark counterfeiting...|$|R
40|$|Transport phloem is {{no longer}} {{associated}} with impermeable pipes, but is instead considered as a leaky system in which loss and retrieval mechanisms occur. Local stem chilling {{is often used to}} study these phenomena. In this study, 5 -cm-lengths of stems of 3 -year-old oak trees (Quercus robur L.) were locally chilled for 1 week to investigate whether observa-tions at stem and leaf level {{can be explained by the}} leakage-retrieval mechanism. The chilling experiment was repeated three times across the growing season. Measurements were made of leaf photosynthesis, carbohydrate concentrations in leaves and bark, stem growth and maximum daily stem shrinkage. Across the growing season, a feedback inhibition in leaf photo synthesis was observed, causing increased dark respiration and starch concentration. This inhibition was attributed to the total phloem resistance which locally increased due to the cold temperatures. It is hypothesized that this higher phloem resistance increased the phloem pressure above the cold block up to the source leaves, inducing feedback inhibi-tion. In addition, an increase in radial stem growth and carbohydrate concentration was observed above the cold block, while the opposite occurred below the block. These observations indicate that net lateral leakage of carbohydrates from the phloem was enhanced above the cold block and that translocation towards regions below the block decreased. This behaviour is probably also attributable to the higher phloem resistance. The <b>chilling</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> radial stem growth an...|$|R

Traders need to submit 8 documents to export and 10 to import—as opposed to France, for example, where only 2 documents are needed both for imports and exports. The high cost of doing business leads to fewer businesses operating within Egypt which causes unemployment. Egypt's unemployment rate reached 11.8 percent in the second quarter of 2011, down from 11.9 percent in the first quarter (although higher than last year's 8.96 percent). Additionally, there is no bankruptcy law in Egypt and entrepreneurs that fail to pay debts can face prison sentences.|$|E

Additionally, equilibrium final offers diverge more when disputants are optimistic than when they are not, and even more when optimism is naïve as opposed to sophisticated. The implication is that FOA rules, though instituted to lessen the <b>chilling</b> <b>effect</b> of arbitration <b>on</b> negotiations, interact with optimistic beliefs in a way that worsens the <b>chilling</b> <b>effect.</b> Data from controlled laboratory experiments confirm that optimistic expectations increase the distance between the disputants final bargaining positions as well as the probability of dispute.

40|$|Once {{termed the}} “metaphysics” of patent law, the {{doctrine}} of inherent anticipation has befuddled courts and practitioners alike for decades. Inherent anticipation refers {{to the notion that}} a previously published reference can disclose each and every limitation of a later–patented invention without expressly delineating those limitations. These (un) disclosed limitations are necessarily present, or inherent, within the previously published reference. When a previously published reference discloses a later–claimed invention expressly or inherently, the patent covering the later–claimed invention is invalid because the invention lacks novelty. Thus, {{the doctrine of}} inherent anticipation allows invalidation of a patent {{in whole or in part}} upon a showing that a prior reference contained a patentee’s later–disclosed invention, even if the earlier reference did not expressly disclose what the patentee claimed as his invention. Courts, including the Federal Circuit, have grappled with whether a person having ordinary skill in the relevant art must recognize inherent features in the prior art reference for the doctrine of inherent anticipation to apply. The resulting intracircuit split in Federal Circuit case law fostered two competing schools of thought on this issue. The Federal Circuit eventually held that recognition of inherent features is not required. Commentators, however, have called upon the court to revisit the doctrine due to its potential <b>chilling</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> innovation. This Note suggests that the Federal Circuit should reexamine the doctrine, paying particular attention to considerations of whether or not a person having ordinary skill in the art was capable of identifying inherent features in the asserted prior art reference.
