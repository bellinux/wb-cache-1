The chitosan flakes were modified into chitosan beads and the beads were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde in order to study copper adsorption and regeneration in a packed-bed column. Five consecutive adsorption and desorption cycles were carried out and a chitosan mass loss of 25 % was observed, after the last cycle. Despite the loss of chitosan material, an improved efficiency {{in the second and third}} cycles was observed with the adsorbent utilizing 97 and 74 % of its adsorbent capacity in the second and third cycles, respectively. The fourth and fifth cycles, however, showed a decreased efficiency, and breakage of the beads was observed after the fifth cycle. In the desorption experiments, 91 – 99 % of the adsorbed copper was regenerated in the first three cycles. It was also observed that the copper can be regenerated at a concentration of about a thousand fold the initial concentration. The first cycle of adsorption could be accurately described with a shrinking core particle model combined with a plug flow column model. The input parameters for this model were determined by batch characterization methods, with as only fitting parameter, the effective diffusion coefficient of copper in the bead[URL]...|$|R

SELECT models were used to model escapement, wherever appropriate. Size-selectivity curves based on the logistic model fitted the aquarium and field data better than asymmetrical Richards curves. The lobster length at 50 % retention (L 50) on the escapement curve for 100 -mm mesh in the aquarium (75. 5 mm CL) approximated the minimum legal size (75 mm CL); however estimates of L 50 increased to 77. 4 mm in field trials where trapentrances were sealed, and to 82. 2 mm where trap-entrances were open. Therfore, rock lobsters that cannot escape through the mesh of sealed field traps do so through the trap entrance of open traps. By contrast, the wider selection range and lower L 25 of field, compared to aquarium, tr ials (SR = 8. 2 mm vs. 2. 6 mm; L 25 = 73. 4 mm vs. 74. 1 mm), indicate that small lobsters that {{should be able to}} escape from 100 -mm mesh traps do not always do so. Escapement from 62 -mm mesh traps with open entrance funnels increased by 40 − 60 % over sealed traps.

40|$|Length {{frequency}} distributions {{obtained from}} the FIMS of the west coast <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> constitute one of data inputs into the assessment {{as well as an}} estimate of the percentage of females. The length composition of the catch for each station and leg is obtained from measurements of a sub-sample of the catch, or sometimes the whole catch is measured. Nominal length frequencies (un-weighted frequencies pooled across stations) for males and females have been used previously as inputs to the assessment model of the <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> resource. The same is the case for the percentage of females. If the sampling of <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> for measurement represents a random sample from a station and the sample is representative of the size composition of <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters,</b> then no weighting of the data is necessary. However if this is not the case, then the length frequencies should be weighted before pooling.

Understanding the impacts of climate change on the Tasmanian <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> industry is important because this fishery is ideally placed to be an ‘early warning signal’ for Australian fisheries generally. ...|$|R
40|$|Few {{studies of}} rock-lobster diet have {{included}} analyses of mature females or juveniles of either sex. This {{study focused on}} the diet {{of male and female}} West Coast <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> (Jasus lalandii) in three size classes (viz. : 10 - 35 mm CL (carapace length) - small, 40 - 59 mm CL - medium and 70 - 85 mm CL - large), using visual analyses of stomach contents. The principle aims were to examine potential differences in diet between: (1) male and female rock lobsters; (2) changes in diet with size and (3) a comparison of rock-lobster diet between areas of known fast- and slow-growth rates. The primary prey items of <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> are shown to be the black mussel (Choromytilus meridianalis), ribbed mussel (Aulacomya ater), barnacle (Notomegabalanus algicola), sea urchin (Parechinus angulosus), sponge and crustacean remains. There was no difference in diet between male and female <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> within any size class. Bray-Curtis similarity dendograms and Multi-Dimensional scaling plots revealed differences between small, medium and large rock-lobster diets. Small <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> consumed mainly ribbed and black mussels, whereas medium <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> consumed higher percentages of barnacle and sponge. Sea urchins comprised a substantial percentage of large rock-lobster diet. ANOSIM (Primer v 4. 0) established significant differences (p < 0. 05) among diets of the three size classes. Differences in diet were also observed between areas of fast- and slow-growth rates, but these were limited to the small and medium size classes. Key prey items responsible for this difference in diet were black mussel and rock-lobster remains. The gut fullness index decreased with increasing rock-lobster size. In conclusion, {{there appears to be no}} difference in diet between male and female <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters,</b> regardless of their size. However, rock-lobster diet does appear to vary with size. The inverse relationship between gut fullness indices and size, suggests that small <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters,</b> which have a higher moult frequency, feed relatively more frequently than larger <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters.</b> Diet composition plays a role in determining the growth rate of <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> from different areas...|$|R
