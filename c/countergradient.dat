5000|$|<b>Countergradient</b> variation, {{originally}} termed [...] "contra-gradient variation," [...] {{was coined}} by Richard Levins in his 1968 book Evolution in Changing Environments. [...] Levins first {{used the term}} when describing patterns of body size across an altitudinal gradient in populations of Drosophila, and since then many other instances of <b>countergradient</b> variation have been discovered. A study by Keith Berven and others {{was the first to}} find <b>countergradient</b> variation in a vertebrate. Specifically, they found that in comparing montane, high altitude, populations to lowland, low altitude populations of the green frog (Lithobates clamitans, formerly Rana clamitans), rates of growth and development were higher in the montane populations. This is counter to what is expected since high altitude populations grow slower than low altitude ones in their respective environments. Similar to the results of this study, most of the known instances of <b>countergradient</b> variation are associated with a latitudinal or altitudinal gradient having an effect on growth rate (see Examples section).|$|E
50|$|Many {{examples}} of <b>countergradient</b> variation {{have been discovered}} {{through the use of}} transplant experiments. <b>Countergradient</b> variation of growth rate {{is one of the most}} common examples. Growth rate and body size have important ecological implications such as how they impact an animal's survival, life history, and fecundity. <b>Countergradient</b> variation has been described in many ectothermic animals, since ectotherms rely on environmental temperature to regulate their metabolic rates, and thus, their growth rates. Ectotherms grow at a slower rate as latitude increases due to this impact of temperature. However, under countergraident variation, when these same animals are placed in a common environment with their low latitude relatives, they grow faster relative to the low latitude population. These studies are useful in predicting how animals can adapt to and will survive in different environmental conditions.|$|E

40|$|During the {{development}} of the topographic map from vertebrate retina to superior colliculus (SC), EphA receptors are expressed in a gradient along the nasotemporal retinal axis. Their ligands, ephrin-As, are expressed in a gradient along the rostrocaudal axis of the SC. <b>Countergradients</b> of ephrin-As in the retina and EphAs in the SC are also expressed. Disruption of any of these gradients leads to mapping errors. Gierer's (1981) model, which uses well-matched pairs of gradients and <b>countergradients</b> to establish the mapping, can account for the formation of wild type maps, but not the double maps found in EphA knock-in experiments. I show that these maps can be explained by models, such as Gierer's (1983), which have gradients and no <b>countergradients,</b> together with a powerful compensatory mechanism that helps to distribute connections evenly over the target region. However, this type of model cannot explain mapping errors found when the <b>countergradients</b> are knocked out partially. I examine the relative importance of <b>countergradients</b> as against compensatory mechanisms by generalising Gierer's (1983) model so that the strength of compensation is adjustable. Either matching gradients and <b>countergradients</b> alone or poorly matching gradients and <b>countergradients</b> together with a strong compensatory mechanism are sufficient to establish an ordered mapping. With a weaker compensatory mechanism, gradients without <b>countergradients</b> lead to a poorer map, but the addition of <b>countergradients</b> improves the mapping. This model produces the double maps in simulated EphA knock-in experiments and a map consistent with the Math 5 knock-out phenotype. Simulations of a set of phenotypes from the literature substantiate the finding that <b>countergradients</b> and compensation can be traded off against each other to give similar maps. I conclude that a successful model of retinotopy should contain <b>countergradients</b> and some form of compensation mechanism, but not in the strong form put forward by Gierer...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{topographic}} {{projection of}} retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons to mouse superior colliculus (SC) or chick optic tectum (OT) is formed in three phases: RGC axons overshoot their termination zone (TZ); they exhibit interstitial branching along the axon that is topographically biased for the correct location {{of their future}} TZ; and branches arborize preferentially at the TZ and the initial exuberant projection refines through axon and branch elimination to generate a precise retinotopic map. We present a computational model of map development that demonstrates that the <b>countergradients</b> of EphAs and ephrinAs in retina and the OT/SC and bidirectional repellent signaling between RGC axons and OT/SC cells are sufficient to direct an initial topographic bias in RGC axon branching. Our model also suggests that a proposed repellen...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{report that}} EphB receptors direct unique axonal {{behaviors}} required for mapping the dorsal-ventral (D-V) retinal axis along the lateral-medial (L-M) {{axis of the}} superior colliculus (SC). EphBs are expressed in a D-V gradient, ephrin-B 1 in a L-M gradient in SC, and ephrin-B 3 at its midline. EphBs and ephrin-Bs are expressed in <b>countergradients</b> in retina and SC. Developmental analyses reveal that retinal axons lack D-V ordering along the L-M axis, but directionally extend branches along it to establish ordered arbors. Directed branch extension is disrupted in EphB 2; EphB 3 -deficient mice resulting in lateral ectopic arbors. Mice with kinase-inactive EphB 2 have similar D-V mapping defects indicating that forward signaling dominates over reverse signaling. Our data suggest that branches of EphB expressing axons are attracted medially by ephrin-B 1, and provide molecular mechanisms for D-V mapping in visual centers...|$|R
50|$|Animals {{are able}} to employ {{different}} strategies for growth and development to counteract environmental challenges. However, {{the fact that all}} individuals do not grow faster and the presence of the mentioned potential fitness trade-offs show that there must be some limit to how much animals can use <b>countergradient</b> growth to compensate for environmental conditions that cause slow growth. Studies of <b>countergradient</b> variation are being explored as a useful way to predict the evolutionary constraints animals face in differing environmental conditions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Countergradient</b> {{variation}} {{is the opposite}} of cogradient variation, in which the environmental effect on the phenotype enhances the genetic effect on the phenotype. One common way to test for both of these patterns is with transplant experiments. By bringing the two populations to the same environment, the environmental effect on phenotype is eliminated and only the genetic effect will cause variation. If cogradient {{variation is}} occurring, the same relationship will be seen in the common environment as the two natural environments. However, if <b>countergradient</b> variation is occurring the opposite relationship of what is seen in the natural environments will be seen in the common environment. For example, if Population 1 has higher growth than Population 2 in their respective natural environments, <b>countergradient</b> variation can be detected if, when brought to the same environment, Population 1 now has lower growth than Population 2. Many of the examples listed above were discovered through these types of experiments. However, the mechanisms of how these differential growth rates arise is not fully understood.|$|E
50|$|Populations that inhabit {{high latitudes}} {{experience}} shorter growing seasons {{than those that}} inhabit low latitudes due to the differences in seasonality. Because of this, {{it is thought that}} <b>countergradient</b> variation of growth is a means to compensate for the short amount of time juveniles have to prepare for winter. With a genetic disposition to grow faster, these individuals can reach a large enough body size to survive through the winter. Increased body size is also associated with higher reproductive output. Additionally, when <b>countergradient</b> variation acts on developmental rates, embryos that develop sooner or hatch out larger will have more time to grow or require less resources, respectively.|$|E
40|$|Much recent {{attention}} {{has focused on}} the robustness of morphogen gradients, i. e. the ability of such gradients to resist change in the face of genetic and environmental perturbations. It has been suggested that some of the complex regulatory interactions found in morphogen gradients—feedback control of morphogen responsiveness, <b>countergradients</b> of secreted inhibitors, etc. —exist to enhance robustness, but how this occurs is only partly understood. Here we identify two strategies that make gradients robust to changes in morphogen synthesis rate. Both utilize non-receptor cell surface molecules to mediate a substantial fraction of morphogen degradation. One exploits the non-linear, i. e. saturable, nature of binding of morphogens to receptors; the other takes advantage of feedback inhibition of receptor synthesis by morphogen signaling. Such strategies {{may play a role in}} the Decapentaplegic gradient in the Drosophila wing disc, in which just such feedback is present, and in which cell surface non-receptor molecules (e. g. proteoglycans) are known to regulate gradient shape...|$|R
40|$|SummaryGraded {{guidance}} {{labels are}} widely used in neural map formation, {{but it is not}} well understood which potential strategy leads to their graded expression. In midbrain tectal map development, FGFs can induce an entire midbrain, but their protein distribution is unclear, nor is it known whether they may act instructively to produce graded gene expression. Using a receptor-alkaline phosphatase fusion probe, we find a long-range posterior > anterior FGF protein gradient spanning the midbrain. Heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) is required for this gradient. To test whether graded FGF concentrations can instruct graded gene expression, a quantitative tectal explant assay was developed. Engrailed- 2 and ephrin-As, normally in posterior > anterior tectal gradients, showed graded upregulation. Moreover, EphAs, normally in anterior > posterior <b>countergradients,</b> showed coordinately graded downregulation. These results provide a mechanism to establish graded mapping labels and more generally provide a developmental strategy to coordinately induce a structure and pattern its cell properties in gradients...|$|R
40|$|Retinal {{ganglion}} cells form orderly topographic {{connections with}} the tectum, establishing a continuous neural representation of visual space. Mapping along the dorsal–ventral axis requires interactions between EphB and ephrin-B cell-surface molecules expressed as <b>countergradients</b> in both retina and tectum. We have discovered that the diffusible TGFß-related factor Radar (Gdf 6 a) is necessary and sufficient for activation of dorsal markers, such as Bmp 4, Tbx 5, Tbx 2 b, and Ephrin-B 2, and suppression of the ventral marker Vax 2 in the zebrafish retina. Radar mutant axons innervate only the dorsal half of the tectum, where they form a compressed retinotectal map. Wild-type cells transplanted into the dorsal retina are able to rescue the dorsal identity of nearby mutant cells. Moreover, Radar overexpression “dorsalizes” retinal ganglion cell identity in the ventral retina. We conclude that Radar is {{near the top of}} a signaling cascade that establishes dorsal–ventral positional information in the retina and controls the formation of the retinotectal map...|$|R
50|$|<b>Countergradient</b> {{variation}} {{is a type}} of phenotypic plasticity that occurs when the genetic components of populations cause phenotypic variation that opposes the phenotypic variation caused by an environmental gradient. This can cause different populations of the same organism to display similar phenotypes regardless of the underlying genetics and environmental differences. To illustrate a common example, <b>countergradient</b> growth rate, consider two populations. The two populations live in different environments that affect growth differently due to many ecological factors, such as the temperature and available food. One population is genetically predisposed to have increased growth rate but inhabits an environment that causes reduced growth rate, such as a cool environment. The second population is genetically predisposed to have decreased growth rates but inhabits an environment that supports increased growth rate, such as a warm environment. Since the genetic influence will opposes the environmental influence, both populations will have a similar intermediate growth rate. <b>Countergradient</b> variation can reduce apparent variability by creating similar phenotypes, but it is possible for the two populations to show phenotype diversity if either the genetic gradient or the environmental gradient has a stronger influence.|$|E
50|$|Take {{the example}} of Sceloporus undulatus, the eastern fence lizard. These lizards {{demonstrate}} <b>countergradient</b> variation in growth rate across a latitudinal gradient. That is, in a common environment eggs from populations from {{the northern part of}} their range hatch out sooner than the eggs from populations at a more southern range. This is opposite the pattern seen in their native habitats. One explanation for this could be that the northern eggs are also naturally larger, so they have more yolk energy available. Originally this maternal investment in larger eggs was thought to support increased developmental rate. However when yolk is removed from the eggs so that the populations have equal energy sources, there is still a substantial difference in growth. Therefore, the mechanism behind this differential growth rate may lie in the efficiency of energy use.|$|E
40|$|A {{gradient}} HPLC {{approach in}} combination with a <b>countergradient</b> system for online biochemical detection (BCD) to screen for inhibitors of serine proteases is described. For gradient separations, this novel <b>countergradient</b> system was developed to produce a biocompatible constant solvent composition in the BCD. The <b>countergradient</b> system is based on retaining complete gradients in an additional preparative HPLC column, followed by subsequent and reversible elution to the separation column effluent. Major advantages compared with existing <b>countergradient</b> systems are that no additional LC pumps are needed and enhanced stability. The developed <b>countergradient</b> system was systematically characterized applying different gradient programs. Inhibitors eluting in a post-column continuous flow analysis interfere with the enzymatic release of fluorescent 7 -amino- 4 -methylcoumarin (AMC) from an AMC-labeled peptide.

40|$|Despite the {{abundance}} of guidance cues in vertebrate nervous systems, {{little is known about}} cooperation between them [1 - 3]. Motor axons of the lateral motor column (LMCL) [4, 5] require two ligand/receptor systems, ephrinA/EphA 4 and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) /Ret, to project to the dorsal limb [6 - 8]. Deletion of either EphA 4 or Ref in mice leads to rerouting of a portion of LMCL axons to the ventral limb, a phenotype enhanced in EphA 4;Ret double mutants [7, 8]. The guidance errors in EphA 4 knockouts were attributed to the lack of repulsion from ephrinAs in the ventral mesenchyme [6, 7, 9]. However, it has remained unclear how GDNF, expressed dorsally next to the choice point [8], acts on motor axons and cooperates with ephrinAs. Here we show that GDNF induces attractive turning of LMCL axons. When presented in <b>countergradients,</b> GDNF and ephrinAs cooperate in axon turning, indicating that the receptors Ret and EphA 4 invoke opposite effects within the same growth cone. GDNF also acts in a permissive manner by reducing ephrinA-induced collapse and keeping the axons in a growth-competent state. This is the first example of two opposing cues promoting the same trajectory choice at an intermediate target...|$|R

The new bacteria were enriched on complex sulfidic medium within a benthic gradient chamber in oxygen-sulfide <b>countergradients,</b> but the bacteria have {{so far not been}} isolated in pure culture, and a detailed characterization of their metabolism is still lacking. The bacteria are colorless, gram-negative, and vibrioid-shaped (1. 3 - to 2. 5 - by 4 - to 10 -m) cells that multiply by binary division and contain several spherical inclusions of poly [...] hydroxybutyric acid. The cells have bipolar polytrichous flagella and exhibit a unique swimming pattern, rotating and translating along their short axis. Free-swimming cells showed aerotaxis and aggregated at ca. 2 M oxygen within opposing oxygen-sulfide gradients, where they were able to attach via a mucous stalk, forming a cohesive whitish veil at the oxic-anoxic interface. Bacteria attached to the veil kept rotating and adapted their stalk lengths dynam-ically to changing oxygen concentrations. The joint action of rotating bacteria on the veil induced a homoge-neous water flow from the oxic water region toward the veil, whereby the oxygen uptake rate could be enhanced up to six times, as shown by model calculations.

40|$|The {{importance}} of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) as a methane sink in freshwater systems is largely unexplored, partic-ularly in peat ecosystems. Nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-damo) was recently discovered and {{reported to be}} catalyzed by the bacterium “Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera, ” which is affiliated with the NC 10 phylum. So far, several “Ca. Methylomirabilis oxyfera ” enrichment cultures have been obtained using {{a limited number of}} freshwater sediments or wastewater treatment sludge as the inoculum. In this study, using stable isotope measurements and porewater profiles, we inves-tigated the potential of n-damo in a minerotrophic peatland in the south of the Netherlands that is infiltrated by nitrate-rich ground water. Methane and nitrate profiles suggested that all methane produced was oxidized before reaching the oxic layer, and NC 10 bacteria could be active in the transition zone where <b>countergradients</b> of methane and nitrate occur. Quantitative PCR showed high NC 10 bacterial cell numbers at this methane-nitrate transition zone. This soil section was used to enrich the preva-lent NC 10 bacteria in a continuous culture supplied with methane and nitrite at an in situ pH of 6. 2. An enrichment of nitrite-reducing methanotrophic NC 10 bacteria was successfully obtained. Phylogenetic analysis of retrieved 16 S rRNA and pmoA genes showed that the enriched bacteria were very similar to the ones found in situ and constituted a new branch of NC 10 bacteria with an identity of less than 96 and 90 % to the 16 S rRNA and pmoA genes of “Ca.

40|$|Measurements of {{turbulent}} fluctuations of velocity, salinity, {{and suspended}} particulate matter (SPM) are presented. The data show persistent <b>countergradient</b> buoyancy fluxes. These <b>countergradient</b> fluxes are controlled by the ratio of vertical turbulent kinetic energy (VKE) and available potential energy (APE) terms in the buoyancy flux equation. The onset of <b>countergradient</b> fluxes is found to approximately coincide with larger APE than VKE. It is shown here that the ratio of VKE to APE can be written as the square of a vertical Froude number. This number signifies {{the onset of the}} dynamical significance of buoyancy in the transport of mass. That is when motions driven by buoyancy begin to actively determine the vertical turbulent transport of mass. Spectral and quadrant analyses show that the occurrence of <b>countergradient</b> fluxes coincides with a change in the relative importance of turbulent energetic structures and buoyancydriven motions in the transport of mass. Furthermore, these analyses show that with increasing salinity-induced Richardson number (Ri), <b>countergradient</b> contributions expand to the larger scales of motions and the relative importance of outward and inward interactions increases. At the smaller scales, at moderate Ri, the <b>countergradient</b> buoyancy fluxes are physically associated with an asymmetry in transport of fluid parcels by energetic turbulent motions. At the large scales, at large Ri, the <b>countergradient</b> buoyancy fluxes are physically associated with convective motions induced by buoyancy of incompletely dispersed fluid parcels which have been transported by energetic motions in the past. Moreover, these convective motions induce restratification and enhanced settling of SPM. The latter is generally the result of salinity-induced convective motions, but SPM-induced buoyancy is also found to play a role. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

Three parametrizations are suggested to formulate the turbulent heat flux and are evaluated using the observations. The parametrization that accounts for the anisotropic nature of turbulence and buoyancy flux predicts both observed downgradient and <b>countergradient</b> transport of heat more accurately than those that do not.

Therefore, the momentum parameterization in the {{standard model}} is in general unjustified.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2001 The {{vertical}} transport of horizontal momentum by cumulus convection is investigated in observations and model simulations of the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE). Estimates of convective momentum transport (CMT) are {{obtained from the}} COARE momentum budget, aircraft dual-Doppler radar observations, cloud-resolving models, and CMT parameterizations. The role of CMIT in the large-scale circulation of the tropical Pacific is examined in the process. Budget estimates of CMT are shown to be highly uncertain, with no detectable signature of CMT above 850 mb. Below 850 mb, there is a slight tendency for downgradient transport. The pressure term is {{the major source of}} uncertainty in the budget. Radar CMT estimates are also only marginally significant, but show a tendency for <b>countergradient</b> transport above the time-mean low-level westerly jet. <b>Countergradient</b> transport is enhanced during westerly wind bursts, suggesting a role for CMT {{in the evolution of the}} Madden-Julian Oscillation. Convective updrafts accomplish nearly all of the CMT observed by the radars. A high-resolution 3 D mesoscale model simulation of the December westerly wind burst also indicates the presence of <b>countergradient</b> transport by convective updrafts above the low-level jet. Momentum transport in the mesoscale model is much larger than either observational estimate, however. Differences in magnitude between the mesoscale model and the radar observations are attributed to the inability of the radar to adequately resolve vertical velocity features. The global model parameterization of Gregory et al. shows reasonable agreement with the mesoscale model at upper levels, but does not produce the <b>countergradient</b> layer above the low-level jet, suggesting the need for modification of simple mass flux representations of CMT.

40|$|Two {{seemingly}} opposite evolutionary {{patterns of}} clinal variation in body size and associated life history traits exist in nature. According to Bergmann's rule, body size increases with latitude, a temperature effect. According to the converse Bergmann rule, body size decreases with latitude, a season length effect. A third pattern causally {{related to the}} latter is <b>countergradient</b> variation, whereby populations of a given species compensate seasonal limitations at higher latitudes by evolving faster growth and larger body sizes compared to their low latitude conspecifics. We discuss these patterns and argue {{that they are not}} mutually exclusive because they are driven by different environmental causes and proximate mechanisms; they therefore can act in conjunction, resulting in any intermediate pattern. Alternatively, Bergmann and converse Bergmann clines can be interpreted as over- and undercompensating <b>countergradient</b> variation, respectively. We illustrate this with data for the wide-spread yellow dung fly, Scathophaga stercoraria (Diptera: Scathophagidae), which in Europe shows a Bergmann cline for size and a converse Bergmann cline (i. e., <b>countergradient</b> variation) for development time. A literature review of the available evidence on arthropod latitudinal clines further shows a patterned continuum of responses. Converse Bergmann clines due to end-of-season time limitations are more common in larger species with longer development times.

40|$|When a {{premixed}} flame propagates in {{a turbulent}} flow, {{not only does}} turbulence affect the burning rate (e. g., by wrinkling the flame and increasing its surface area), but also the heat release in the flame perturbs the pressure field, and these pressure perturbations affect the turbulent flow and scalar transport. For instance, the latter effects manifest themselves in the so-called <b>countergradient</b> turbulent scalar flux, which has been documented in various flames and has challenged the combustion community for approximately 35 years. Over the past decade, substantial {{progress has been made}} in investigating (a) the influence of thermal expansion in a premixed flame on the turbulent flow and turbulent scalar transport within the flame brush, as well as (b) the feedback influence of <b>countergradient</b> scalar transport on the turbulent burning rate.

40|$|The {{assumption}} is commonly made in stratospheric diffusion studies that the large-scale eddy flux of various properties obeys the Fickian law which {{requires that the}} flux in a coordinate direction is proportional to and {{in the direction of}} the gradient. Measurements of eddy fluxes of ozone and sensible heat reveal, however, that the law is violated in the lower stratosphere where the meridional fluxes are <b>countergradient</b> at most latitudes. Use is made of the mixing length hypothesis to derive a more general expression for the large-scale eddy flux which is able to account for the phenomenon of <b>countergradient</b> flux. It is found that the critical parameter in determining whether the horizontal flux is in the gradient or <b>countergradient</b> direction is the ratio of the mean slope of the mixing path (or surface) to the mean slope of the isopleths of the property being considered. A procedure is outlined for evaluating the coefficients needed to solve the derived diffusion equation.

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>countergradient</b> transport on {{the speed of}} a statistically stationary, planar, 1 D premixed flame that propagates in frozen turbulence is studied theoretically and numerically by considering the normalised magnitude NB of the <b>countergradient</b> flux to be an input parameter. Spectra of admissible flame speeds are analytically determined and explicit travelling wave solutions are found for two algebraic relations widely used to close the mean rate of product creation. A problem of selecting the physically relevant solution that is approached for sufficiently steep initial conditions is addressed. It is argued that, if NB is larger than an analytically determined critical number NcrB, then the type of the physically relevant solution is drastically changed. If NB NcrB, the physically relevant solution is of pushed wave type, i. e. its speed is controlled by processes in the entire flame brush. Analytical expressions for the speed of the physically relevant solution as a function of NB and the density ratio are obtained. For NB > NcrB, the mean flame brush thickness and the spatial profile of the Favre-averaged combustion progress variable are also determined analytically. These results are validated by numerical simulations. Both analytical expressions and numerical data indicate that (i) both turbulent flame speed and thickness are decreased when NB is increased and (ii) the direction of total scalar flux (i. e. the sum of <b>countergradient</b> and gradient contributions) is strongly affected not only by NB, but also by the shape of the dependence of the mean rate of product creation on the mean combustion progress variable...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} the evolutionary and ecological significance of geographic variation in life history traits, {{we must understand}} whether the patterns are induced through plastic or adaptive responses. The Eastern Fence Lizard, Sceloporus undulatus, exhibits <b>countergradient</b> variation (larger body sizes, et cetera, in northern, cooler environments; presumed adaptive) in life history traits across its large geographic range. However, cogradient variation (the expected result from a plastic response, although not necessarily inconsistent with adaptation) has been suggested as a null hypothesis, especially on fine geographic scales because of relatively small environmental changes. Here we focus on life history variation on a fine geographic scale to test whether cogradient variation is exhibited even though <b>countergradient</b> variation is exhibited at larger scales, and if so, what mechanisms {{are involved in the}} switch. We examined north and south populations (~ 2 ° latitude between) of the S. undulatus, and the Florida Scrub Lizard, S. woodi, by measuring adult body sizes, reproduction, and hatchling body sizes over a two year period and conducting reciprocal transplants of juvenile lizards each year. Our results indicate cogradient variation (larger body size in the southern population experiencing a warmer environment) in life history traits of S. undulatus and <b>countergradient</b> variation, a lack of variation in adult body size, in S. woodi along the Florida peninsula. Thus, S. undulatus exhibits cogradient variation at fine geographic scales and <b>countergradient</b> variation at larger scales. Reciprocal transplants revealed that the larger adult body sizes in the southern population of S. undulatus could be explained by longer growth periods allowed by greater intrinsic survival. In S. woodi, the larger than expected adult body sizes in the north could be explained by faster intrinsic and extrinsic juvenile growth rates in the northern population. Because S. undulatus and S. woodi remain distinct species associated with distinct, though adjacent, habitats, we also looked for habitat-specific adaptations. The second reciprocal transplant (between species and habitats) revealed habitatspecific adaptations in juvenile growth rates, but not juvenile survival.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that turbulent scalar flux {{can show the}} <b>countergradient</b> behavior almost everywhere within a premixed flame brush {{with the exception of}} a narrow zone at the leading edge (LE) of the flame where the flux always shows the gradient behavior. Moreover, many experts consider the existence of such a zone to be of crucial importance in order for the flame to be able to propagate into unburned mixture. The goal of the present work is to dispute this widely-recognized belief by studying an asymptotic case of density variations localized to infinitely thin, wrinkled flamelets that separate unburned and burned mixture and self-propagate at a finite speed into the former mixture. First, simple mathematical and physical examples are discussed in order to argue that a premixed flame can propagate into unburned mixture even if averaged scalar flux does not show the gradient behaviour at the LE. This phenomenon is associated with the straightforward influence of large-scale velocity oscillations (i. e. turbulent diffusion as far as a premixed turbulent flame is concerned) on the mean rate of product creation at the LE. Second, by considering a fully-developed, statistically stationary, planar, one-dimensional turbulent premixed flame, the following criterion is obtained. Turbulent scalar flux shows the <b>countergradient</b> behavior at the LE if turbulent burning velocity is less than the laminar flame speed multiplied by the density ratio and by a factor that (i) is equal to unity if perturbations of the local burning rate in flamelets are disregarded, but (ii) can substantially depend on the Lewis number and preferential diffusion effects if such perturbations are taken into account. Third, development of a premixed turbulent flame and straining of the flame brush by non-uniform mean flow are argued to suppress <b>countergradient</b> scalar flux at the LE...|$|E
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} second-order turbulence-closure model {{based on}} Mellor-Yamada level 3 {{is used to}} examine the nocturnal turbulence characteristics over Rattlesnake Mountain in Washington. Simulations of mean horizontal velocities and potential temperatures agree well with data. The equations for the components of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) show that anisotropy contributes in ways that are counter to our intuition developed from mean flow considerations: shear production under stable conditions forces the suppression of the vertical component proportion of total TKE, while potential-temperature variance under stable conditions leads to a positive (<b>countergradient)</b> contribution to the heat flux that increases the vertical component proportion of total TKE. This paper provides a qualitative analysis of simulated turbulence fields, which indicates significant variation over the windward and leeward slopes. From the simulation results, turbulence anisotropy is seen to develop in the katabatic flow region where vertical wind shears and atmospheric stability are large. An enhancement of the vertical component proportion of the total TKE takes place over the leeward slope as the downslope distance increases. The <b>countergradient</b> portion of the turbulent heat flux {{plays an important role in}} producing regions of anisotropy...|$|E
40|$|The {{horizontal}} property flux induced by tides is examined by both analytical and numerical models. It is {{found that this}} flux is highly heterogeneous in the vertical and may be directed up the mean gradient near the bottom. This <b>countergradient</b> tidal flux {{is a consequence of}} differing boundary conditions satisfied by velocity and property fields, and hence a robust feature. The corresponding tidal diffusivity is substantial where tides are strong and hence potentially important in the mean property balance. 1...|$|E
40|$|A balance {{equation}} for {{the difference}} in the conditioned velocities (u) over bar (b) and (u) over bar (u), derived and validated recently (Lipatnikov, 2008 a, 2008 b), is numerically solved in a statistically planar, one-dimensional case in order to (a) highlight the influence of premixed turbulent flame development on the direction of the mean scalar flux and (b) assess the equation by comparing computed trends with available experimental and DNS data. Numerical results show that (a) the flux (rho u '' c '') over bar gradient during an early stage of flame development followed by a transition to <b>countergradient</b> scalar transport (i. e., (rho u '' c '') over bar center dot del(c) over bar > 0) at certain instant t(tr); (b) the transition time t(tr) is increased by the rms turbulent velocity and decreases when the density ratio or the laminar flame speed increases; and (c) even after the transition from gradient to <b>countergradient</b> scalar transport, the mean flame brush thickness grows because the mean rate of product creation overwhelms the transport term in the combustion progress variable balance equation and serves to not only control the turbulent burning rate, but also cause the growth of the thickness...|$|E
40|$|Hale ML, 2000. Inheritance of {{geographic}} variation in body size, and <b>countergradient</b> variation in growth rates, {{in the southern}} brown bandicoot Isoodon obesulus. Australian Mammalogy 22 : 9 - 16. The inheritance {{of geographic}} variation in body size in the southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus) was investigated through a common-environment crossbreeding experiment. The geographic variation in body size is related to habitat type, suggesting {{that it may be}} adaptive. Adults from two locations in Western Australia, Perth (large animals) and Albany (small animals), were collected and offspring from both hybrid and non-hybrid matings were reared under controlled conditions. All four variables examined (head length, pes length, ear length and body weight) were found to possess a large genetic component, supporting the interpretation that the geographic variation in size is adaptive. The three length variables initially showed additive genetic variation, although the variation in body weight displayed dominance. Genetically controlled differences in growth rate were also detected, with the smaller animals, found in the relatively poorer environment, possessing the faster intrinsic growth rate. Thus, not only does there appear to be adaptive divergence in initial body size, but the <b>countergradient</b> variation in growth rates provides additional evidence for adaptive divergence in this species...|$|E
40|$|This study {{provides}} evidence of <b>countergradient</b> variations in life-history traits among coastal cod Gadus morhua off the Norwegian coast, suggesting {{the existence of}} sub-populations. One-yr-old wild-caught individuals from 70 °N were smaller, grew slower, weighed less, and had a lower condition factor (CF) than southern cod from 60 °N during the sampling period from June to February. In contrast, both a higher growth potential {{and an increase in}} CF were found in northern cod when offspring of northern and southern cod from the same area and of the same age as the wild cod were housed together in a ‘common-garden’ experiment. The rapid growth in northern cod was achieved by higher success in food competition when given a restricted amount of food. Active feeding behaviour and larger energy allocation to storage tissues, as suggested by the higher increase in condition, represents adaptations to the high-latitude environment for northern cod and <b>countergradient</b> variation. These differences suggest the existence of genetically distinct sub-populations along the Norwegian coast. Development of sub-populations that differ in behaviour and life-history strategies are discussed in relation to mechanisms for local retention of early life stages and local adaptation of older stages. Sub-populations with different life histories may respond differently to fisheries, and attention to this could be beneficial for improving fisheries management...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that scalar {{transport}} in premixed turbulent flames may occur not only {{in the direction of the}} decreasing mean value of a scalar (the so-called gradient diffusion), but also in the opposite direction (counter-gradient diffusion). The present paper addresses the issue of transition from gradient to <b>countergradient</b> diffusion as a premixed turbulent flame develops. Using three different methods, basically the same simple criteria of the transition are derived and an important role played by flame development is highlighted. The criteria are qualitatively assessed by comparing them with available experimental and DNS data...|$|E
