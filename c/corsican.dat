5|$|Born in {{an ancient}} noble family from the Languedoc, he entered the French royal army as a {{volunteer}} in 1769. After having served in the <b>Corsican</b> legion, he transferred in 1771 to a Dragoon regiment. From 1777, he served as {{an officer in the}} Dragoon Regiment of the Languedoc. By 1792, he had become its colonel.|$|E
5|$|He {{came into}} {{conflict}} with Paoli, who had decided to split with France and sabotage the <b>Corsican</b> contribution to the Expédition de Sardaigne, by preventing a French assault on the Sardinian island of La Maddalena. Bonaparte and his family fled to the French mainland in June 1793 because of the split with Paoli.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the government's lack of interest, news of the invasion sparked popular support in favour of the <b>Corsicans.</b> James Boswell, a long-standing champion of the <b>Corsicans,</b> lobbied leading members of society and organised thirty cannons to be sent from the Carron Ironworks in Falkirk. Boswell's book An Account of Corsica became a best-seller and helped to fan public interest in {{the plight of the}} <b>Corsicans.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{first wave}} of <b>Corsicans</b> arrived in the Venezuelan region of Paria around 1830. Antonio Oletta, Francisco and Cayetano Morandi, José Vicente Franceschi and Juan Bautista Lucca {{were some of the}} first <b>Corsicans</b> to settle in the town of Carúpano. Once in Paria, many <b>Corsicans</b> founded cocoa {{exporting}} firms, most notable being that of the Franceschi & Co, established in 1830 and still existing today, making it one of Venezuela's oldest companies.|$|R

5|$|In July 1793, Bonaparte {{published}} a pro-republican pamphlet entitled Le souper de Beaucaire (Supper at Beaucaire) which gained him {{the support of}} Augustin Robespierre, younger brother of the Revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre. With {{the help of his}} fellow <b>Corsican</b> Antoine Christophe Saliceti, Bonaparte was appointed artillery commander of the republican forces at the Siege of Toulon.|$|E
5|$|Most nuthatches are {{woodland}} {{birds and}} the majority are found in coniferous or other evergreen forests, although each species has a preference for a particular tree type. The strength of the association varies from the <b>Corsican</b> nuthatch, which is closely linked with <b>Corsican</b> pine, to the catholic habitat of the Eurasian nuthatch, which prefers deciduous or mixed woods but breeds in coniferous forests {{in the north of}} its extensive range. However, the two species of rock nuthatches are not strongly tied to woodlands: they breed on rocky slopes or cliffs, although both move into wooded areas when not breeding. In parts of Asia where several species occur in the same geographic region, there is often an altitudinal separation in their preferred habitats.|$|E
5|$|He {{spent the}} early years of the Revolution in Corsica, {{fighting}} in a complex three-way struggle among royalists, revolutionaries, and <b>Corsican</b> nationalists. He was a supporter of the republican Jacobin movement, organising clubs in Corsica, and was given command over a battalion of volunteers. He was promoted to captain in the regular army in July 1792, despite exceeding his leave of absence and leading a riot against French troops.|$|E

He trained to become an artillery officer and, when his father's death reduced his income, was forced to complete the two-year course in one year. He was the first <b>Corsican</b> to graduate from the École Militaire. He was examined by the famed scientist Pierre-Simon Laplace.|$|E

On Mount Ida in Crete the people gather pitch from <b>Corsican</b> pine and Aleppo pine. Gums such as frankincense, myrrh and balsam of Mecca are gathered either by cutting the plant or naturally. Frankincense and myrrh are gathered into the closely guarded temple of the Sabaeans. Cassia and cinnamon also come from the Arabian peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The Chamber of Deputies {{authorised}} a loan of 80 million gold francs {{to allow}} the government to meet its obligations. An expeditionary corps of 13,000–15,000 men commanded by Lieutenant-General Nicolas Joseph Maison was formed. It was composed of three brigades commanded by the maréchaux de camp Tiburce Sébastiani (brother of the <b>Corsican</b> soldier-diplomat Horace François Bastien Sébastiani de La Porta), Philippe Higonet, and Virgile Schneider. The Chief of the General Staff was General Antoine Simon Durrieu.|$|E

50|$|The {{first was}} the {{collapse}} of the French colonial empire. The Colonial Army and colonial enterprises were the principal form of employment for <b>Corsicans.</b> In 1920, <b>Corsicans</b> made up 20% of colonial administration, despite only making up 1% of Metropolitan France's population. The end of colonialism deprived young <b>Corsicans</b> of the opportunities of their elders and forced many to return to the island. This situation resulted in the emergence of a regionalist movement with the objective of increasing the number of opportunities for the islanders. During the uprisings in Algeria in 1958 and 1961, Corsica was the only French départment that joined the insurgent colonists.|$|R
5|$|After {{securing}} {{additional financing}} from Eurimages and ARTE, Tarr used these and the Hungarian funds to undertake nine days of shooting on sets {{he had built}} {{at a cost of}} €2 million. The French funding was cross-financed for the shoot by T. T. Filmműhely. As funds were frozen however, the <b>Corsican</b> subcontractor Tanit Films (controlled by the film's then-executive producer Jean-Patrick Costantini), terminated their contract with Balsan and through legal action compelled the production to dismantle the sets and leave the shooting location. At that point, Ognon Pictures shut the production down and disassociated themselves from the film, and Tarr withdrew to Hungary to regroup.|$|E
5|$|The Alpine chough has an {{extensive}} though sometimes fragmented range, estimated at 1–10millionsquare kilometres (0.4–3.8million sq mi), {{and a large}} population, including an estimated 260,000 to 620,000 individuals in Europe. The <b>Corsican</b> population has been estimated to comprise about 2,500 birds. Over its range as a whole, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the global population decline criteria of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The nuthatches {{are all in}} {{the genus}} Sitta Linnaeus, 1758, a name derived from , Ancient Greek for this bird. Nuthatch refers to the {{propensity}} of some species to wedge a large insect or seed in a crack and hack at it with their strong bills. Species boundaries in the nuthatches are difficult to define. The red-breasted nuthatch, <b>Corsican</b> nuthatch and Chinese nuthatch have breeding ranges separated by thousands of kilometres, but are similar in habitat preference, appearance and song. They were formerly considered to be one species, but are now normally split into three and comprise a superspecies along with the Krüper's and Algerian nuthatch. Unusually for nuthatches, all five species excavate their own nests.|$|E
5000|$|In 1794, the <b>Corsicans</b> under Pasquale Paoli seceded {{from the}} French Republic, and invited British troops {{to assist in}} driving French troops from the island. For two years, the island {{was part of an}} Anglo-Corsican Kingdom. However, {{relations}} between British and <b>Corsicans</b> soured. Spain declared war against Britain in 1796, putting all British territories in the Mediterranean at risk and prompting the British to withdraw from Corsica. Several pro-Paoli <b>Corsicans</b> fled the island or were exiled, and in September 1798, they formed a light infantry company known as the [...] "Franc Tireur Corses" [...] on Minorca, which at the time was held by the British. The unit consisted of seven officers and 226 other ranks.|$|R

5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass are {{important}} in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red fescue help to bind the sand. Sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists of this arid habitat, and petalwort is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes. Bird's-foot trefoil, pyramidal orchid, bee orchid and carline thistle flower on the dunes, and Holkham's <b>Corsican</b> pines shelter creeping lady's tresses and yellow bird's nest orchids. The shingle ridges on Scolt Head Island and from Blakeney Point east to Salthouse attract biting stonecrop, sea campion, yellow horned poppy, sea thrift and sea beet. Sea barley is a scarcer species of this habitat.|$|E
5|$|In April and May 1794, seamen from Agamemnon, led by Nelson, helped {{capture the}} <b>Corsican</b> town of Bastia. The French {{surrendered}} on 21 May, after a 40-day siege. After this action, Agamemnon {{was forced to}} sail to Gibraltar to undergo urgent repairs, the ship having become very worn out after just 16 months at sea, despite having undergone a fairly extensive refit just prior to being recommissioned. Upon completion of her repairs, Agamemnon returned to Corsica, anchoring south of Calvi on 18 June. After Hood arrived with additional ships, Agamemnon contributed guns and men to the 51-day siege of Calvi, during which time Nelson lost the sight in his right eye when a French shot kicked sand and grit into his face. The town surrendered on 10 August, Agamemnon having lost six men in the engagement. Shortly thereafter the inhabitants of Corsica declared themselves to be subjects of His Majesty King George III.|$|E
5|$|Nelson was {{a highly}} {{experienced}} officer who had been blinded in one eye during fighting in Corsica in 1794 and subsequently commended for his capture of two Spanish ships of {{the line at the}} Battle of Cape St. Vincent in February 1797. In July 1797, he lost an arm at the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife and had been forced to return to Britain to recuperate. Returning to the fleet at the Tagus in late April 1798, he was ordered to collect the squadron stationed at Gibraltar and sail for the Ligurian Sea. On 21 May, as Nelson's squadron approached Toulon, it was struck by a fierce gale and Nelson's flagship, HMS Vanguard, lost its topmasts and was almost wrecked on the <b>Corsican</b> coast. The remainder of the squadron was scattered. The ships of the line sheltered at San Pietro Island off Sardinia; the frigates were blown to the west and failed to return.|$|E

5|$|On 20 January 2017, {{after the}} 1–1 Ligue 1 away draw against SC Bastia, Balotelli claimed on Instagram {{that he was}} a victim of racist abuse when fans of the <b>Corsican</b> club {{allegedly}} made monkey noises directed at him during the match and just {{prior to the start of}} the match. On the following day, Alassane Pléa (Balotelli's Nice teammate) confirmed that he had heard the monkey noises directed at Balotelli. The Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP) announced an investigation into Balotelli's allegations. On 18 February 2017, Balotelli was sent off once again, in his fourteenth Ligue 1 appearance, a 1–0 win at Lorient; he received a straight red card in the second half for insulting referee Tony Chapron in English. He was given a two-match ban (the second match was a suspended ban that would be triggered in the event of any further misconduct by Balotelli) by the Ligue 1’s disciplinary committee on 23 February.|$|E
5|$|The French, German and Hungarian co-production of {{the film}} was fraught with {{difficulty}} and obstacles. The first of these was the suicide in February 2005, days before shooting was due to begin, {{of the film}}'s French producer, Humbert Balsan. As the original financing of the film collapsed, the remaining producers managed to secure stop-gap funding which allowed them to shoot nine days of footage on the expensive <b>Corsican</b> sets, until they were shut down through legal action by the local subcontractor. After many expressions of support from European film organisations, production companies and government bodies, a new co-production contract was signed in July 2005 with a revised budget and shooting schedule. It then emerged that all rights to the film had been ceded to a French bank under the original production agreement, and only after further changes in the film's backers was a deal struck with the bank to allow shooting to resume in March 2006, over a year later than had been originally envisaged.|$|E
5|$|For the few {{species on}} which data are available, the average {{nuthatch}} lifespan {{in the wild}} is between 2 and 3.5years, although ages of up to 10 years have been recorded. The Eurasian nuthatch has an adult annual survival rate of 53% and the male <b>Corsican</b> nuthatch 61.6%. Nuthatches and other small woodland birds share the same predators: accipiters, owls, squirrels and woodpeckers. An American study showed that nuthatch responses to predators {{may be linked to}} reproductive strategies. It measured the willingness of males of two species to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of a sharp-shinned hawk, which hunts adult nuthatches, or a house wren, which destroys eggs. The white-breasted nuthatch is shorter-lived than the red-breasted nuthatch, but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the red-breasted showed greater concern with the hawk. This supports the theory that longer-lived species benefit from adult survival and future breeding opportunities while birds with shorter life spans place more value on the survival of their larger broods.|$|E
