Deering joined the row and {{followed}} the men to a <b>cargo</b> <b>shed.</b> The shed was dark, but the sliding doors on the other side were open and he crawled under a freight car and crossed the track. A minute or two afterwards he stopped. So far as he could see, nobody but a few train-hands were about; the steamer had swung away from the wharf and was steering for the Narrows. Deering laughed and went up the hill behind the water-front.|$|E

What she had done was not likely to be regarded as anything very unusual in that country, where most men are liable to startling vicissitudes of fortune and there are no very rigid social distinctions; but Ingleby failed to recognize this just then, and it was not astonishing that he should idealize her for her courage.|$|E

Pier 24 was constructed between 1912 and 1916, and the annex followed in 1935-36. Several businesses were housed in Pier 24 annex over the twentieth century, including Nelson Steamship Company, American-Hawaiian Steamship Company and Williams, Diamond & Company. The principal cargo stored by these companies included sugar, copra, vanilla, whale oil, and hides. Pier 24 was demolished after its transit shed and bulkhead caught fire in 1997.

50|$|The Cairns Wharf Complex is of {{importance}} in demonstrating {{the evolution of}} Queensland's history as it represents an important stage of development of Queensland and Australian wharf facilities dating from 1909 to 1942. The wharves are among the earliest Australian attempts to introduce the medium of reinforced concrete into wharf construction. The construction of number 6 wharf in 1942 demonstrates the importance of Cairns as a centre for Pacific forces during World War II, and its timber and reinforced concrete construction reflects war-time expediency. The wharf-side <b>cargo</b> <b>sheds,</b> numbers 2 and 3, are the most visible surviving remnant of the Cairns waterfront development in the early 1900s. The cargo crane is the last remaining crane from the earliest period of the wharf's history in the 1910s, and helps to {{convey a sense of}} the industrial maritime history of the wharves. White's (Sugar) Shed is a place which demonstrates an evolutionary stage of the North Queensland sugar industry and wharf practices dating to the 1920s through 1950s. The closure of the shed to sugar handling in the early 1960s {{was the result of the}} opening of Cairns bulk sugar terminal at Portsmith in 1964. The opening of the bulk terminals reduced significantly the wharf labour force required for the handling of sugar. The railway lines demonstrate the importance of rail links in establishing Cairns as the dominant regional port in far North Queensland, and consequently, as a viable town. The railway lines are also integral to an understanding of the operation of the wharves, with wharf shed platforms that aligned to the height of the rail cars.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first to}} be built were numbers 2 and 3 wharf <b>cargo</b> <b>sheds,</b> {{constructed}} on the decks of the concrete wharves. The number 3 wharf was constructed in 1912, and it is suspected that the number 3 wharf shed was constructed in late 1912 or early 1913. The number 2 wharf was constructed in 1912-1913, and the original sheds on the old timber wharf were retained {{as long as possible}} prior to being demolished in 1913. The number 2 wharf shed was constructed soon after this demolition. The numbers 2 and 3 sheds were connected by a continuous roof by 1925 and probably earlier. Much of the infrastructure related to the number 2 and 3 sheds was constructed in about 1913, including the nearby railway tracks and two 10-ton cranes adjacent to the tracks and immediately behind sheds 1 and 2. Loading platforms were constructed behind number 2 wharf shed by 1925. The wharf sheds were elevated above the surrounding dock land and wharves. This raised configuration of wharf sheds was considered to be state-of-the-art design which allowed easy loading and unloading of goods to and from railway cars and into the storage sheds (facilitated by wharf shed platforms that aligned to the height of the rail cars). An [...] "awning" [...] was installed {{to the rear of the}} number 2 wharf shed in 1942. The wharf shed roofs were cleaned and repainted in 1947, and the whole of the roof cladding was replaced in 1954. The northern end of the number 2 wharf shed is referred to as the [...] "old engine room" [...] on a 1978 plan.|$|R

The port also became a massive rally area for cargo and armoured vehicles which were subsequently forwarded to Southampton for transportation to the Falklands as required.

40|$|Cytokines are {{secreted}} by {{cells of}} the immune system to coordinate immune responses. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation of macrophages elicits the de novo biosynthesis and secretion of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF). TNF is an early-response, proinflammatory cytokine with essential roles in immunity; but paradoxically, excessive secretion of TNF has clinically important sequelae in inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Whilst the physiological effects of TNF and many other cytokines are well known, we have only begun to understand the intracellular trafficking pathways that lead to their secretion. Yet, these pathways potentially harbor molecular targets that could rationalize new avenues for control of cytokines in disease. Previous efforts from this laboratory have chartered the key organelles for constitutive trafficking of TNF to the macrophage cell surface and have set the stage for this PhD project, which further investigates the molecules and carriers involved in TNF trafficking and secretion. Based on very preliminary data at the outset, this project has focused on exploring the involvement of PIs and PI 3 -kinases (PI 3 Ks) in TNF trafficking. The PI 3 K family and their products are classically involved in signal transduction, and evidence to support their regulation in constitutive secretory pathways were minimal {{at the beginning of the}} study. A central goal of this thesis was to investigate a role for PI 3 K in the secretory pathway of TNF. Initial studies surveyed the distribution of different phosphoinositides (PIs) on the subcellular membranes in macrophages. By expression of various fluorescent PI-binding modules as probes, results in Chapter 3 provide the first map of PIs associated with macrophage organelles. Our findings also suggest candidate PIs with possible physiological roles in TNF trafficking. In a series of investigations using PI 3 K broad-spectrum and isoform-selective inhibitors, small-interfering RNAs, and genetic inactivation in mice, the class I PI 3 K p 110 δ was identified as the predominant isoform in regulating TNF trafficking and secretion. Ablation of p 110 δ function selectively blocked the secretion of TNF and accumulated the cytokine at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). These findings led to the use of live-cell imaging to study tubular carriers emerging from the TGN for TNF transport. It was then also revealed that LPS acutely induces the recruitment of p 110 δ to the Golgi membranes where it is kinase active. Furthermore, this activity of p 110 δ was shown to be essential for dynamic fission of membrane tubules carrying TNF at the TGN. These findings in Chapter 4 have not only provided the first demonstration of a class I PI 3 K and its activity at the Golgi, but also excitingly unravelled p 110 δ as a new component of tubule-fission machinery at the TGN. Finally, work was extended beyond these novel discoveries to explore the influence of p 110 δ activity in fission of different tubular carriers at the TGN and their roles in cargo export. TNF exits the TGN in tubules that were identified by the GRIP-golgin p 230, but not those demarked by golgin- 97. By comparing the requirement of p 110 δ activity in fission of these TGN GRIP tubules, data in Chapter 5 have revealed a selectivity of p 110 δ for fission of p 230 tubules, but not golgin- 97 tubules. Preliminary studies with a soluble IL- 6 and other <b>cargo</b> <b>shed</b> light on cargo-sorting at the TGN and the selectivity of tubular carriers and their fission machinery. Overall, this thesis provides evidence to support a role for PI 3 K p 110 δ in TNF trafficking and secretion. A new function for p 110 δ in fission of a selective set of tubular carriers for TNF at the TGN is revealed. In a broader view, findings from this work have highlighted the potential of p 110 δ inhibition as a means to modulate TNF secretion in the future in treatment of inflammatory diseases...|$|E
50|$|In 1990, Sudan {{had only}} one {{operational}} deep-water harbor, Port Sudan, situated on an inlet of the Red Sea. The port had been built from scratch, beginning in 1905, to complement the railroad line from Khartoum to the Red Sea by serving as the entry and exit point for the foreign trade the rail line was to carry. It operated as a department of SRC until 1974 when it {{was transferred to the}} Sea Ports Corporation, a newly established public enterprise set up to manage Sudan's marine ports. Facilities at the port eventually included fifteen <b>cargo</b> berths, <b>sheds,</b> warehouses, and storage tanks for edible oils, molasses, and petroleum products. Equipment included quay, mobile, and other cranes, and some forklift trucks, but much of the handling of cargo was manual. There were also a number of tugboats, which were used to berth ships in the narrow inlet.|$|R
50|$|One {{contributing}} factor to the town's success was {{the management of}} its harbour, and therefore the efforts of its harbour board. The prospect of an official harbour board was first considered in 1913, when dissatisfaction among the Bowen Chamber of Commerce led to an inquiry into the financial arrangements of the port. The inquiry, dated November 27, 1913, found the current port revenue situation lacking, with the revenue at the time being insufficient {{to provide for the}} upkeep of the wharf, let alone improvements. As a result, the Bowen Harbour Board Act of 1914 was gazetted on September 1, 1914. The first meeting of the Board was held on March 22, 1915 in the Bowen Shire Hall, and the Board's by-laws were gazetted on July 15, 1915. Changes made to the system of revenue collection, such as charging for berthage, and changes to the haulage system, quickly resulted in the Harbour Board's revenue substantially increasing, and then annually increasing for a prolonged period thereafter. This in turn allowed further expansion of port facilities through the construction of new <b>cargo</b> <b>sheds</b> and facilities to accommodate the expanding range of export materials.As the port developed so did the role of the Harbour Board. By 1933 the Board was seeking a new location for its offices. The building selected by the Board was constructed in 1921 for ship owners/agents, MacDonald Hamilton and Co., who occupied the site until closing their business in Bowen in 1930. When the Bank of New South Wales and the Australian Bank of Commerce merged in 1929, they purchased the building. In 1931 they moved back to the original Bank of New South Wales and auctioned the building to the Bowen Harbour Board for £1150. In the same year, the upper floor of the building was leased, for one pound per week, to a Mr A. V. Murrey (the only other bidder at the auction), who was the secretary of Bowen Consolidated Mines, Bowen Salt Ltd., Bowen Fire Brigade and the Bowen Chamber of Commerce. After his death in the 1950's his son Dennie Murray took over the lease, and remained until his death in 1960, at which time he was replaced as secretary by Mr Lew Head.|$|R
50|$|The Mobile {{waterfront}} {{was subjected}} to a storm surge of 11.6 ft, which still stands as the second-highest in the state's history, {{just short of the}} record set in Gulf Shores by the 1906 Mississippi hurricane, and the highest ever recorded at Mobile. The tides severely flooded Mobile's business district up to four blocks inland, and it took until the late afternoon of July 6 for floodwaters to recede. Some streets were submerged to a depth of up to 10 ft, and many residents fled to the Battle House Hotel on relatively higher ground. Ultimately, waters still reached the hotel, flooding its lobby to a depth of just over 1 ft. In advance of the storm, most wholesale merchants stacked their goods above the high water mark of the 1906 hurricane, but this proved inadequate; tides locally ran nearly 2 ft higher than in 1906, ruining merchandise closest to the ground at a cost of around $500,000. Many miles of railroads were covered by floodwaters and debris, and the tidal action ravaged wharves. At a Mobile and Ohio Railroad <b>cargo</b> storage <b>shed,</b> approximately 11,000 bales of cotton were washed away.|$|R
