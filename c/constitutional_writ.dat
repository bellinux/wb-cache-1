40|$|To {{cultivate}} {{the next twenty}} years of LatCrit theory, praxis, and community, the afterword looks back to LatCrit’s Critical Global Classroom (2003 – 04) (CGC), an ABA-accredited summer study-abroad program. The CGC invited U. S. law students to study comparative constitutionalism, law and society, and truth and reconciliation movements while sojourning Chile, Argentina, and South Africa under the question: “Shall the recent history of the Global South become the imminent fate of the Global North?” While enrolled in the 2004 CGC, the author learned about the extraordinary <b>constitutional</b> <b>writ</b> of habeas data, which various Latin American countries adopted as they reconstituted their democracies from the wreckage of the fascist military dictatorships that terrorized their peoples {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century. Habeas data enables individuals to petition their government, and certain private entities, to learn what information has been kept on them and for what purposes, as well as to challenge, rectify, and even delete such information. With the recent revelations of the National Security Agency’s massive electronic surveillance of people throughout and beyond the United States, learning about habeas data could constitute a vital intervention for the discourse of U. S. -based legal scholars writing in English, as well as for the community of critical socio-legal scholars who affiliate with LatCrit. To both constituencies, the afterword urges attending carefully to the terrible histories that birthed habeas data, while being cognizant of their continuities with today’s “neoliberal states of insecurity and surveillance,” in order to fashion a strategic alliance capable of grounding habeas data rights within the United States Constitution...|$|E
40|$|In earlier times, the pouring of {{oil into}} the sea {{is said to have}} been done {{deliberately}} in order to forestall rough seas. Although oil may be highly effective at calming troubled waters, we know that seafarers would not rely on this ancillary technique alone. Instead, they tried to engineer strong ships capable of breaking waves on their own. In Australia, there are two distinct types of remedies available to a litigant when seeking judicial review through constitutional means. First, the writs of mandamus, certiorari and prohibition which are called ‘constitutional writs’. Second, injunctions and declarations which are ‘equitable remedies’. The <b>constitutional</b> <b>writs</b> are often criticised for being only obtainable through archaic processes and governed by technical rules. Accordingly, equitable remedies, which are available in the field of public law precisely because of the inadequacies of the <b>constitutional</b> <b>writs,</b> have played a critical part in shaping modern Australian administrative law. However, mainly due to their different historical backgrounds, the <b>constitutional</b> <b>writs</b> and the equitable remedies operate in a fundamentally different manner. It has been proposed by some Australian legal minds that equitable remedies will have a “knock-on” effect for the other remedies by refocusing judicial review. However, it will be suggested by the author of this text that administrative lawyers should not rely too heavily upon the capacity of equitable remedies to become the forefront of judicial review. Instead of trying to pour oil on troubled waters, focus should be shifted to the <b>constitutional</b> <b>writs,</b> which have the innate potential of fulfilling the constitutional mandate of Section 75 (v) as intended...|$|R

However, since the Parliament is not constitutionally able to limit or abolish access to the High Court for the purpose of applying for one of these [...] "constitutional writs", such applications have become a major means of challenging migration decisions.

40|$|This {{article is}} aimed at {{revealing}} the tendency of the "constitutionalisation" of the Insurance Law and the exceptional protection of the Constitutional Court to the so-called "Subjects of Constitutional Protection". That issue {{can be observed in}} the way an insured or loss payee of a Life Group policy in a "defenselessness situation" by means of a writ for protection of constitutional rights demands the payment of the death benefits or the total and permanent incapacity for work without meeting the contractual and legal requirements to access to the mentioned coverages. The stance of Constitutional Court, taking into account that the substancial law prevails over procedural law, is based on on the principles of solidarity, immediacy and subsidiarity when someone invokes the basic rights for life, minimum wage, decent housing, equality, social security among others. It is worth mentioning that such <b>constitutional</b> <b>writ</b> has been appeared on cases in which the insurance companies have refused to pay the compensation due to a reticent insured, a preexistence illness or when, over time, the insured or beneficiary of the policy loses the possibility of the chose in action due to have started the statute of limitations under the Colombian Law for insurances contract. Este artículo tiene como objeto dar a conocer la tendencia a la “constitucionalización” del Derecho de Seguros y la protección excepcional de la Corte Constitucional a los denominados “Sujetos de Protección Constitucional”.  Lo anterior se representa en la manera en que un asegurado o beneficiario de una Póliza Vida Grupo en “estado de indefensión” mediante  una acción de tutela solicita hacer efectivos los amparos de muerte o incapacidad total y permanente sin cumplir con los requisitos contractuales y legales para acceder a dichas coberturas. La posición de la Corte Constitucional, teniendo en cuenta que prevalece el derecho sustancial sobre el procesal, se basa en los principios de solidaridad, inmediatez y subsidiaridad, cuando se invoca la protección de los derechos fundamentales a la vida, mínimo vital, vivienda digna, igualdad, seguridad social entre otros.  Se resalta que dicha tutela constitucional, se ha presentado en casos en los cuales las Compañías Aseguradoras han negado el pago de la Indemnización bajo el argumento de haber sido el asegurado reticente por tratarse de una enfermedad preexistente o cuando, por el transcurso del tiempo, el asegurado o beneficiario de la póliza pierde la posibilidad de ejercer el derecho de acción por haber operado el término de prescripción contemplado en la ley Colombiana para el Contrato de Seguros...|$|E

40|$|Part I gives {{background}} on AEDPA, points out what Section 2254 (d) (1) does, explains why AEDPA’s {{standard of review}} is problematic, and introduces the Suspension Clause challenge. Part II describes the writ of habeas corpus at common law and observes {{that there are two}} versions of habeas’s history, a narrow version and a functionalist version. The functionalist approach is essential to a strong attack on AEDPA. Part III introduces the age-old debate over the <b>writ’s</b> <b>constitutional</b> scope. To formulate the best Suspension Clause challenge to Section 2254 (d) (1), a challenger should argue that: (1) the Suspension Clause impliedly guarantees a right, or entitlement, to the writ of habeas corpus that Congress cannot take away; (2) that right includes meaningful review of a petitioner’s federal claims; and (3) that right also includes some federal review. Part IV argues that the Court’s interpretation of Section 2254 (d) (1) does not merely {{make it more difficult for}} petitioners to successfully obtain the writ; it builds a wall that renders petitioners voiceless, courts powerless, and justice a nullity. This Part focuses on three pieces of AEDPA’s standard of review and argues that each of these pieces adds significant barriers to substantive postconviction review. Collectively, they form the suspension wall: (1) all claims “adjudicated on the merits” in state court receive deference; (2) that deference requires petitioners to show that the state court decision was “contrary to or an unreasonable application of” federal law, perhaps the most deferential standard in all of Supreme Court jurisprudence; (3) the federal law applied in the state court must be “clearly established, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. ” Part V then discusses the early Suspension Clause challenges in the circuit courts and distinguishes the reasoning in those cases from AEDPA’s current suspension wall...|$|R
