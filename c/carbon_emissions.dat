Ethanol from Brazilian sugarcane performed better, recovering initial <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> in 4 years, while U.S. corn ethanol required 167 years and cellulosic ethanol required a 52 years payback period. The study limited the analysis a 30-year period, assuming that land conversion emits 25 percent of the carbon stored in soils and all carbon in plants cleared for cultivation. Brazil, China, and India were considered among the overseas locations where land use change would occur {{as a result of}} diverting U.S. corn cropland, and it was assumed that new cropland in each of these regions correspond to different types of forest, savanna or grassland based on the historical proportion of each converted to cultivation in these countries during the 1990s.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a production model involving a manufacturer that uses two different technologies, the green {{technology and the}} standard technology. The green product produced by the green technology {{can be used as}} a substitute for the traditional product produced by the standard technology, but not vice versa. Three models are considered. The first model concerns with product substitution only and serves as a benchmark model for the next two models, the <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> allowance model and the <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> trading model. The second model extends the product substitution model by imposing an upper limit on the total <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> allowance for each firm. The third model extends the second model to cater for <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> trading. For the <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> allowance model, analytical result shows that the optimal production quantity of any product depends on both its total <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> allowance quota and its unit <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> profit, and the effect of substitution improves the service level, the expected profit of the manufacturer, and the green of product mix. For the <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> trading model, analytical result shows that whenever the production quantity of any product is optimal, the marginal profit of production (i. e. the additional profit obtained by producing an extra item) should be equal to the unit price of <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> trading within the market. Moreover, the optimal policy of either model reduces the total amount of <b>carbon</b> <b>emission,</b> thus producing less pollution to the environment. Lastly, the optimal profits obtained by using the <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> trading model are larger than the corresponding optimal profits obtained by using the <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> allowance model.

According to IPCC <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> {{calculation}} instruction, {{the amount}} of industrial <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> of downtown of Nanning from 2003 - 2012 is evaluated. With LMDI element decomposition method, the <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> of industrial energy consumption in Nanning downtown is decomposed into effect of five aspects such as energy structure, energy intensity, industrial structure, economic scale and population size. It turns out that: the energy structure change can promote the increase of <b>carbon</b> <b>emission.</b> The energy consumption structure should be optimized {{and the proportion of}} high-carbon energy consumption should be reduced; The energy intensity is the leading driving factor of <b>carbon</b> <b>emission.</b> The energy efficiency should be further improved to control the increase of <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> to some degree; The industrial structure restrains the increase of <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> in a great degree.

5|$|LCA is {{used for}} example in the {{building}} sector. Buildings today account for the 40% of the world’s energy use.

Growing interest, space, and attention in the architecture sector are directed to environmental issues according to the principles of green building.

5|$|A {{major benefit}} of {{biodiesel}} is lower <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions,</b> although the energy balance of liquid biofuels {{is a matter}} of controversy. Research is being undertaken into converting rapeseed oil into biodiesel, and the European biofuels directive intended to ensure that 5.75% Europe's transport fuel came from renewable sources by 2010. There is only enough used vegetable oil in the UK to contribute 0.38% of current road fuel demand and if all the arable land in the UK were turned over to biofuel crops this would still only satisfy 22% of the existing requirement for road transport. Serious concerns regarding the ethics of growing biodiesel in developing countries and importing the fuel to Europe have been raised {{on the grounds that they}} may replace much needed food crops. Converting any mainstream transport system to a renewable one also involves the conundrum that for consumers to use it the infrastructure must be in place, but high levels of use may be required to finance the infrastructure. Developments are thus slow at present and renewably powered vehicles very much the exception.|$|E
40|$|Global warming has {{attracted}} attention {{from all over}} the world and led to the concern about <b>carbon</b> <b>emission.</b> Kyoto Protocol, as the first major international regulatory emission trading scheme, was introduced in 1997 and outlined the strategies for reducing <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> (Ratnatunga et al., 2011). As the increased interest in carbon reduction the Protocol came into force in 2005, currently there are already 191 nations ratifying the Protocol(UNFCCC, 2012). Under the cap-and-trade schemes, each company has its <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> target. When company’s <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> exceeds the target the company will either face fines or buy emission allowance from other companies. Thus unlike most of the other social and environmental issues <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> could trigger cost for companies in introducing low-emission equipment and systems and also emission allowance cost when they emit more than their targets. Despite the importance of <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> to companies, <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> reporting is still operating under unregulated environment and companies are only required to disclose when it is material either in value or in substances (Miller, 2005, Deegan and Rankin, 1997). Even though there is still an increase in the volume of <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> disclosures in company’s financial reports and stand-alone social and environmental reports to show their concern of the environment and also their social responsibility (Peters and Romi, 2009), the motivations behind corporate <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> disclosures and whether carbon disclosures have impact on corporate environmental reputation and financial performance have not yet to explore. The problems with <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> lie on both the financial side and non-financial side of corporate governance. On one hand corporate needs to spend money in reducing <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> or paying penalties when they emit more than allowed. On the other hand as the public are more interested in environmental issues than before <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> could also impact on the image of corporate regarding to its environmental performance.

5|$|Support for airport {{expansion}} {{is based on}} an economic case that regards the air transport industry not only as an important industry in its own right, but also as a facilitator of growth for the economy as a whole. One study predicts that the government's strategy will realise an additional £13billion per annum in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2030. Another study which is critical of the government approach, and which favours addressing environmental impacts through increased taxation of air transport, indicates a negative economic benefit resulting from airport expansion. In 2006 the industry was responsible for over 6 per cent of all UK <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions,</b> a figure that is set to rise as demand increases. Under current strategies of emissions reduction and growth in air transport, air travel in the UK could account for up to 50 per cent of the UK carbon budget by 2050. Industry attempts to address this issue are longer term efforts based on technological and operational improvements, whilst government policy is based on the inclusion of air transport within emissions trading schemes. Critics advocate a shift in government policy to address environmental impacts by constraining the growth in demand for air travel, primarily through the use of economic instruments to price air travel less attractively. Local environmental issues include noise and air quality, and the impact of these, particularly {{in the case of the}} former, is subject to debate. Government policy generally is that these are local issues best addressed locally, and has introduced legislation designed to facilitate this.|$|E
