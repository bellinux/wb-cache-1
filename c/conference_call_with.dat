5|$|Although {{preliminary}} {{reports from}} Reuters suggested an Oblivion release {{in tandem with}} the launch of the Xbox 360 on November 22, 2005, and the original announcement of the game set a release date of Winter 2005, Take-Two Interactive announced, during a <b>conference</b> <b>call</b> <b>with</b> analysts on October 31, 2005, that Oblivions release was to be delayed until the second quarter of Take-Two's fiscal year. The new schedule would put the release between February and April 2006. The delay surprised many, especially online retailers, who had begun accepting pre-orders for consoles bundled with Oblivion. News of the delay came at a time following a burst of bad news from the company, including a 60% drop in expected earnings per share, the ongoing Hot Coffee minigame controversy, worse than average sales for the company's flagship , sudden drops in share prices, and delays for other company products.|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} abruptly {{went into}} a 30 through 40 degree left bank. Geib initially believed that an engine failure had occurred.

While trying to declare the emergency, the plane was in a communications dead zone between North America and Asia. Even with a weak signal, they contacted another Northwest Airlines flight, Flight 19, who helped Flight 85 declare the emergency since they were closer to Alaska. Flight 85's captain reported {{that none of the}} emergency procedures available could correct the problem. The pilots established a <b>conference</b> <b>call</b> <b>with</b> Northwest Airlines at the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, and the Northwest employees there were unable to find a solution to the sudden bank.

He considers one of the primary achievements of Occupy to have been to bring together communities to discuss and debate in a democratic forum, thereby rejecting the ideologies of selfishness proposed by the likes of Ayn Rand. Chomsky then discusses how to get the corporate sector out of politics and how to introduce greater democracy to the U.S. He rounds off this chapter with a discussion of the nature of the Republican and Democratic parties, the work of Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci and the role of the U.S. housing bubble in the global depression.|$|E

During a <b>conference</b> <b>call</b> <b>with</b> journalists, Weller also cited the character's [...] "tremendously romantic and very moving" [...] storyline as another reason he accepted the part.

And so everyone has to move into another gear and say, 'Okay, this problem is not going to go away. It's now affecting our side. We do have a machine which we believe can assist in the resolution of this problem.'

[...] In a 27 October disclosure, the unit was [...] "mainly engaged in recycling business for medical waste." [...] Humalabo was described initially said to undertake [...] "research and development/sale of skin improving substances using [...] basidomycota", but in the later statement {{was said to be}} [...] "mainly engaged in development of [...] supplements with ingredients extracted from shiitake mushroom mycelium." [...] While the basic description of News Chef as a maker of cookware for microwave ovens was not changed, Olympus added that [...] "disease prevention and prognosis through foods" [...] was one of its objects.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} analyst information intermediary roles using a textual analysis of analyst reports and corporate disclosures. We employ a topic modeling methodology from computational linguistic research {{to compare the}} thematic content of a large sample of analyst reports issued promptly after earnings <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> <b>with</b> {{the content of the}} calls themselves. We show that analysts discuss exclusive topics beyond those from <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> and interpret topics from <b>conference</b> <b>calls.</b> In addition, we find that investors place a greater value on new information in analyst reports when managers face greater incentives to withhold value-relevant information. Analyst interpretation is particularly valuable when the processing costs of <b>conference</b> <b>call</b> information increase. Finally, we document that investors react to analyst report content that simply confirms managers’ <b>conference</b> <b>call</b> discussions. Overall, our study shows that analysts play the information intermediary roles by discovering information beyond corporate disclosures and by clarifying and confirming corporate disclosures...|$|R
