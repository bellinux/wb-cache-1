500|$|Rapid {{sequence}} induction and intubation (RSI) is {{a particular}} method of induction of general anesthesia, commonly employed in emergency operations and other situations where patients are assumed to have a [...] "full stomach". The objective of RSI is to minimize the possibility of regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents during the induction of general anesthesia and subsequent tracheal intubation. RSI traditionally involves preoxygenating the lungs with a tightly fitting oxygen mask, followed by the sequential administration of an intravenous sleep-inducing agent and a rapidly acting neuromuscular-blocking drug, such as rocuronium, succinylcholine, or <b>cisatracurium</b> <b>besilate,</b> before intubation of the trachea.|$|E
40|$|Rapacuronium bromide (rapacuronium; ORG- 9487) is a nondepolarising {{muscle relaxant}} (NMBA) {{with a low}} potency [90 % {{effective}} dose(ED 90) 1 mg/kg], which to some extent is responsible for its rapid onset of action. Because of the: high plasma clearance (5. 3 to 11. 1 mg/kg/min) of rapacuronium, its clinical duration of action following single bolus doses up to 2 mg/kg in adults is short (i. e. 1. 5 mg/kg to facilitate rapid tracheal intubation, and to use succinylcholine or rocuronium rather than rapacuronium in a rapid-sequence setting. Rapacuronium, however, is a suitable alternative to mivacurium chloride (mivacurium) and succinylcholine for short procedures (e. g. ambulatory anaesthesia). Rocuronium bromide (rocuronium) is a relatively low-potent, intermediate-acting NMBA. Its main advantage is the rapid onset of neuromuscular block whereby good or excellent intubating conditions are achieved within 60 to 90 seconds after rocuronium 0. 6 mg/kg (2 x ED 95). and within 60 to 180 seconds after smaller doses (1 to 1. 5 x ED 95). Larger doses of rocuronium (greater {{than or equal to}} 1 mg/kg) seem to be suitable for rapid-sequence induction under relatively light anaesthesia. However, it is still a matter of controversy whether, {{in the case of an}} unanticipated difficult intubation, the long duration of rocuronium administered in such large doses outweighs the many adverse effects of succinylcholine. Rocuronium has mild vagolytic effects and does not release histamine. even when administered in large doses. Rocuronium is primarily eliminated via the liver and its pharmacokinetic profile is similar to that of vecuronium bromide (vecuronium). Unlike vecuronium, rocuronium has no metabolite. <b>Cisatracurium</b> <b>besilate</b> (cisatracurium). the 1 R-cis, 1 'R-cis isomer of atracurium besilate (atracurium) is approximately 4 times more potent than atracurium. The onset time of cisatracurium is significantly slower than after equipotent doses of atracurium. The recommended intubating dose is 0. 15 to 0. 2 mg/kg (3 to 4 times ED 95). Over a wide range of clinically relevant doses the recovery proper ties of cisatracurium are affected by neither the size of the bolus dose nor by the duration of infusion. Unlike atracurium, cisatracurium does not trigger histamine release. Like atracurium. cisatracurium undergoes Hofmann elimination. In contrast to atracurium. cisatracurium does not undergo hydrolysis by nonspecific plasma esterases. Moreover, about 77 % of the drug is cleared by organ-dependent mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{appropriate}} {{choice of}} anesthesia for patients (pts) undergoing renal transplantation (Ktx) requires minimal toxicity and accurate monitoring for pts {{at high risk}} for metabolic, cardiovascular, and respiratory perioperative complications. We evaluated the anesthetic management and postoperative follow-up in pediatric Ktx performed in the last 12 years in our institution. From 1988 to 1999, 75 ASA class II-III pts (45 males, 22 females) younger than 18 years scheduled for Ktx were studied: 39 received a graft from a cadaveric donor (CD) and 26 from a living donor (LD). All pts were treated with dialysis within 24 h before the procedure. Standard monitoring consisted of an electrocardiogram, central venous pressure, non-invasive arterial pressure, pulse oximetry, and inspiratory and expiratory gas analysis. If necessary, an arterial cannula and pediatric pulmonary catheter were introduced. Anesthesia was induced with sodium thiopental, propofol, halothane, or sevoflurane and maintained with isoflurane and/or fentanyl and droperidol in O- 2 :N 2 O (FiO(2) 0. 4 %). As muscle relaxants atracurium or <b>cisatracurium</b> <b>besilate</b> were used, except in allergic pts, in whom vecuronium or rocuronium bromide was administered. Dopamine, 20 % mannitol, and furosemide were used to increase diuresis. Continuous morphine and ketoralac infusions were used for postoperative pain relief. The surgical technique was the same in all cases. Complications and renal-function (RF) recovery were evaluated relating to CD and LD using the chi-square test; differences in mean anesthesia and surgical time were evaluated by Student's t-test; survival curves were calculated from the day of Ktx to death or last follow-up and estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Values of P below 0. 05 were considered significant. Postoperative immunosuppressive therapy was based on cyclosporine together with other conventional drugs. Mean anesthesia time was 228 +/- 65 min. Mean kidney ischemia time for CD was 16. 5 +/- 4 h. Four pts (3 CD, 1 LD) died within 72 h postoperatively: 3 due to cardiac failure and 1 to metabolic coma. Six pts showed cardiovascular and 3 had infective complications, all successfully treated. Three pts (2 CD, 1 LD) died within 2 to 12 months after, surgery; 10 (6 CD, 4 LD) had graft failure and are still alive on dialysis; 58 (38 CD, 20 LD) are alive in good health after a mean follow-up of 57. 6 +/- 36. 6 months (range 12 - 120 months). Fifteen of 26 pts younger than 12 years (21 CD and 5 LD) recovered RF intraoperatively (10 CD, 5 LD); 1 with CD and 1 with LD showed postoperative graft failure and 2 with CD died within 72 h postoperatively, 22 (18 CD and 4 LD) are alive in good health. This group showed no statistical difference compared to pts older than 12 years. Of 16 pts (15 CD and 1 LD) with body weight (BW) less than 25 kg, 6 showed intraoperative (5 CD, I LD) recovery of RF. The 3 deaths were all in CD pts, 3 within 72 h and one 2 months after surgery; only 1 LD had postoperative graft failure. Twelve pts (75 %) (12 CD, 80 %) are alive in good health. Compared to pts with BW of 25 kg or more, this group showed lower intraoperative recovery of RF (P I 0. 05). No peri- and postoperative complications occurred in all 26 LD pts (100 %). Recent advances in surgery, anesthesia, immunosuppression, and antimicrobial prophylaxis have made Ktx a more predictable procedure even in pediatric pts. For high-risk pts, mortality and morbidity can be controlled by accurate surgical, anesthetic, and postoperative management. Pts younger than 12 years and with BW less than 25 kg are more likely to develop peri- and postoperative complications...|$|E
