The south Indian state of Kerala also has a cabinet-level AYUSH department. The Central Council of Homoeopathy was established in 1973 to monitor higher education in homeopathy, and National Institute of Homoeopathy in 1975. A minimum of a recognized diploma in homeopathy and registration on a state register or the <b>Central</b> <b>Register</b> of Homoeopathy is required to practise homeopathy in India.|$|E

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} and improve the completeness of follow up in a cohort study of mortality carried out using the UK National Health Service (NHS) <b>Central</b> <b>Registers.</b> SETTING: This was a follow up study of UK servicemen who served abroad in the 1950 s and 1960 s, including {{those who participated in}} the UK atmospheric nuclear weapon tests and experimental programmes. DESIGN: Details of men for whom follow up achieved using the NHS <b>Central</b> <b>Registers</b> was unsatisfactory were submitted to the Department of Social Security (DSS) for tracing, as were details of men born before 1916 and reported by the NHS <b>Central</b> <b>Registers</b> as currently registered with a general practitioner, and a 1 % sample of remaining men born in or after 1916. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The additional follow up increased the number of deaths fully identified in the cohort by 6. 5 %. Mortality among those untraced on the NHS <b>Central</b> <b>Registers</b> was substantially greater than in the cohort as a whole (10. 2 % v 6. 9 %). Among those reported by the NHS <b>Central</b> <b>Registers</b> as not currently registered with a general practitioner, 2. 7 % were found to have died, as were 1. 1 % of men born before 1916 and currently reported to be registered with a general practitioner. As expected there was clear evidence that information about emigrations supplied by both the NHS <b>Central</b> <b>Registers</b> and DSS is far from complete. CONCLUSION: Standardised mortality ratios based on follow up via the NHS <b>Central</b> <b>Registers</b> alone are likely to be somewhat low, and this should be borne in mind when interpreting the data...|$|R

25|$|The {{process to}} {{establish}} a public ship register commenced in 1881. The background was that a bank was being considered which would have as its purpose to lend money to purchase ships. This would require a legal framework which would firmly establish ownership and collateral in ships. The Sea Law Commission was appointed in 1882 to consider this and other legal aspects of the shipping industry. It {{soon became clear that}} the commission would have ship registration as its main purpose, as other aspects of sea law had to be coordinated internationally. They reached a conclusion which resulted in an 1888 proposal for Parliament which was based on a single, <b>central</b> <b>register</b> for ships. Parliament decided not to consider the law, and similar proposals in 1892, 1893, 1894 and 1897 were similarly dismissed.|$|E
25|$|Some {{other states}} were also divided into land {{divisions}} and land districts; {{in the nineteenth}} century land districts sometimes served as the region name for parts of the state where counties had not been proclaimed yet. Below these are groups of land parcels known as deposited plans, registered plans or title plans (depending on the state). Queensland has registered plans; New South Wales and Western Australia have deposited plans; while Victoria has certified plans. Land can be identified using the number of this plan of subdivision held with the lands department, rather than with a named unit such as a parish (or both can be used); it is becoming increasingly common to use only the plan number. Within these are individual land parcels such as lots; in total there are estimated to be about 10.2 million of these in Australia. The various cadastral units appear on certificates of title, which are given volume and folio numbers; these numbers by themselves are sometimes used to identify land parcels, or in combination with the other units. Detailed maps of these divisions have been required since the introduction of the Torrens title system of a <b>central</b> <b>register</b> of land holdings in South Australia in 1858, which spread to the other colonies. While cadastral data since the 1980s has been digitalised, there remain many old maps showing these divisions held in collections of Australian libraries such as the National Library of Australia, as well as in state libraries.|$|E
2500|$|One of Evans' {{distinctive}} harmonic traits is {{excluding the}} root in his chords, leaving this {{work to the}} bassist, played on another beat of the measure, or just left implied. [...] "If I {{am going to be}} sitting here playing roots, fifths and full voicings, the bass is relegated to a time machine." [...] This idea had already been explored by Ahmad Jamal, Erroll Garner, and Red Garland. In Evans' system, the chord is expressed as a quality identity and a color. Most of Evans' harmonies feature added note chords or quartal voicings. Thus, Evans created a self-sufficient language for the left hand, a distinctive voicing, that allowed the transition from one chord to the next while hardly having to move the hand. With this technique, he created an effect of continuity in the <b>central</b> <b>register</b> of the piano. Laying around middle C, in this region the harmonic clusters sounded the clearest, and at the same time, left room for contrapuntal independence with the bass.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Orwell's wife Eileen started working in the Censorship Department of the Ministry of Information in central London, staying during the week with her family in Greenwich. Orwell also submitted his name to the <b>Central</b> <b>Register</b> for war work, but nothing transpired. [...] "They won't have me in the army, at any rate at present, because of my lungs", Orwell told Geoffrey Gorer. He returned to Wallington, and in late 1939 he wrote material for his first collection of essays, Inside the Whale. For the next year he was occupied writing reviews for plays, films and books for The Listener, Time and Tide and New Adelphi. On 29 March 1940 his long association with Tribune began with a review of a sergeant's account of Napoleon's retreat from Moscow. At the beginning of 1940, the first edition of Connolly's Horizon appeared, and this provided a new outlet for Orwell's work as well as new literary contacts. In May the Orwells took lease of a flat in London at Dorset Chambers, Chagford Street, Marylebone. It was the time of the Dunkirk evacuation and the death in France of Eileen's brother Lawrence caused her considerable grief and long-term depression. Throughout this period Orwell kept a wartime diary.|$|E
60|$|These {{index cards}} might conceivably be {{transparent}} and so contrived as {{to give a}} photographic copy promptly whenever it was needed, and they could have an attachment into which would slip a ticket bearing {{the name of the}} locality in which the individual was last reported. A little army of attendants would be at work upon this index day and night. From sub-stations constantly engaged in checking back thumb-marks and numbers, an incessant stream of information would come, of births, of deaths, of arrivals at inns, of applications to post-offices for letters, of tickets taken for long journeys, of criminal convictions, marriages, applications for public doles and the like. A filter of offices would sort the stream, and all day and all night for ever a swarm of clerks would go to and fro correcting this <b>central</b> <b>register,</b> and photographing copies of its entries for transmission to the subordinate local stations, in response to their inquiries. So the inventory of the State would watch its every man and the wide world write its history as the fabric of its destiny flowed on. At last, when the citizen died, would come the last entry of all, his age and the cause of his death and the date and place of his cremation, and his card would be taken out and passed on to the universal pedigree, to a place of greater quiet, to the ever-growing galleries of the records of the dead.|$|E
