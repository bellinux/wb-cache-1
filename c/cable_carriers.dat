5|$|In 1992, Congress passed must-carry regulations, which {{required}} <b>cable</b> <b>carriers</b> to allocate spectrum to local broadcasters. This affected {{the availability of}} C-SPAN in some areas, in particular C-SPAN2, as some providers chose to discontinue carriage of the channel altogether. Between 1993 and 1994, cable systems in 95 U.S. cities dropped or reduced broadcasts of C-SPAN and C-SPAN2, following {{the implementation of the}} must-carry regulations. Viewers protested these decisions, especially when the changes coincided with matters of local interest occurring in the House or Senate. Some communities, such as Eugene, Oregon and Alexandria, Virginia, were successful in restoring C-SPAN availability. C-SPAN availability was later restored as technological developments that resulted in the expansion of channel capacity on cable providers allowed for mandatory stations and the C-SPAN networks both to be broadcast.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{perceived}} main attractions of a fixed gear bicycle is low weight. Without the added parts required for a fully geared drive train—derailleurs, shifters, cables, <b>cable</b> <b>carriers,</b> multiple chain rings, freewheel hub, brazed-on mounting lugs—a fixed gear bicycle weighs less than its geared equivalent. The chain itself is subject to less sideways force and will not wear out as fast as on a derailleur system. Also, a fixed gear drivetrain is more mechanically efficient than any other bicycle drivetrain, with the most direct power transfer from rider to the wheels. Thus, a fixed gear requires less energy in any given gear to move than a geared bike in the same gear.|$|E

After examining the factors for subscribing to pay-TV and the competitive situation in the market, we have the following findings; (1) <b>Cable</b> TV <b>carriers</b> promote high value-added service provision, such as bundling internet access, and these activities result in competitive superiority over CS <b>carriers.</b> (2) <b>Cable</b> TV <b>carriers</b> receiving bigger investment from local governments tend to gain higher rates of subscription, although they provide smaller numbers of channels with a low charge. (3) The number of terrestrial broadcasting channels which are transmitted via pay-TV carriers can have a large impact on competitive advantage when getting subscribers in the pay-TV market. ...|$|R

5000|$|Due to {{increasing}} demands {{within the field}} of automation technology in the 1980s, such as increasing loads, moving cables guided inside <b>cable</b> <b>carriers</b> often failed, although the <b>cable</b> <b>carriers</b> themselves did not. In extreme cases, failures caused by [...] "corkscrews" [...] and core ruptures brought entire production lines to a standstill, at high cost. As a result, specialized, highly flexible cables were developed with unique characteristics to differentiate them from standard designs. These are sometimes called “chain-suitable,” “high-flex,” or “continuous flex” cables.|$|E
