Traditions vary from region to region; carp is eaten in many parts of the <b>country.</b> <b>Potato</b> salad with {{frankfurter}} or wiener-sausages is popular in some families. Another simple meal which some families favor, especially in regions where Christmas Eve still has the character of a fast day, is vegetable or pea soup. In some regions, especially in Schleswig-Holstein where Danish influence is noticeable, a roasted duck or goose filled with plums, apples and raisins is family tradition. In other regions, especially in Mecklenburg and Pomerania, many families prefer kale with boiled potatoes, special sausages and ham. Many families have developed new traditions for themselves and eat such meals as meat fondue or raclette. In almost all families in all parts of Germany you find a wide variety of Christmas cookies baked according to recipes typical for the family and the region.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In our <b>country,</b> <b>potato</b> is {{a highly}} {{important}} national crop, as a basic food element (almost the population’s second bread), while for the Apuseni Mountains area, potato holds the highest percentage {{and at the same}} time represents an essential food for locals and their animals, as a paramount food support of the population in the area. Its specific renders this crop as a highly demanding species of plant in terms ecologic conditions, humidity and temperature, as well as nutritive elements, as it forms an abundant vegetative mass and a high tuber quantity for the surface unit. It {{is a highly}} consuming nitrogen, potassium, magnesium and calcium plant, as well as with respect to macroelements. Once the potato is harvested, the export of mineral elements from the soil is high, thus determining the rapid soil depletion and demanding for a suitable fertilization of potato crop, adequate to the household system specific to the mountain area. Numerous researches conducted in the area under study reveal the fact that, from a pedoclimatic point of view, there are good and very good conditions for potato crop, considering the climatic abnormalities in the last period. But the severity of the climatic impact varies from one region to another and exerts a serious effect on agriculture. In this highly important sector, climate change...|$|E

Germany typically exports about 14 % of the <b>country’s</b> <b>potato</b> production (1. 6 million MT). Fungicides are used on about 95 % of Germany’s potato crop every year. The primary target of fungicide sprays on potatoes is the fungus Phytophthora infestans which causes the disease known as “late blight. ” In northern Germany, where late blight is very severe due to wet conditions, potato fields typically receive 7 - 10 fungicide applications in a normal year while in the drier southern potato region, 4 - 7 fungicide applications are normally made [1]. If fungicides were not used in German potato production, average national potato production would decline by 22 % [2], equivalent to 2. 6 million MT/year.

40|$|Water {{is one of}} the key {{resources}} {{challenging the}} sustainability of modern agriculture. In developing <b>countries,</b> <b>potato</b> production is increasing because of its ability to provide nutritious food in a short season. However, the potato crop requires profuse irrigation. Yields of commercial potato varieties are often restricted by water availability. Their root systems are generally sparse and shallow, and they close their stomata, preventing photosynthetic carbon assimilation, whilst water is still available in the soil. To enable breeding of drought tolerant varieties, we are developing phenotypic screens that will allow us to explore the genetic basis of key traits for water use efficiency (WUE). From field trials of a genetic mapping population, ten genotypes with contrasting transpiration efficiencies based on leaf δ 13 C values were cultivated under controlled glasshouse conditions. After emergence, plants were grown for 30 days in soils watered to field capacity (30 % volumetric content,- 5 kPa water potential) before being divided into three groups irrigated to 30 %, 20 % (- 300 kPa, slight stress) and 12 % (- 1500 kPa, wilting point) volumetric content. As WUE is a complex phenomenon, we evaluated a number of associated physiological and morphological traits. Tissue samples were also collected at different time points to determine differentially expressed genes at these moisture levels. Response to water stress not only includes closing stomata but also reducing the density of stomata during leaf development. Preliminary data from our experiments shows that transpiration-efficient genotypes, as indicated by low leaf δ 13 C values, have consistently lower stomatal conductance at 12 % volumetric soil moisture than transpiration-inefficient genotypes. Thus transpiration-inefficient genotypes transpire more water at lower soil water content...|$|R

40|$|Early blight, {{economically}} damaging foliar {{disease of}} potato, {{is caused by}} two species of Alternaria genus: A. alternata (Fries.) Keissler and A. solani Sorauer. The disease occurs commonly worldwide on potato crops, particularly in regions with alternating periods of dry weather and high humidity, which favour spore formation and disease development. Harmfulness of early blight is estimated differently in various regions of the world. According to Reinoch (1974), the disease reduces yields up to 25 %, locally 60 %. According to Johnson et al. 1986, Fry 1994, maximum documented yield reductions are usually 20 - 30 %. In Polish climatic conditions high regional losses caused by early blight were recorded, however, most were related to cultivars with recognized susceptibility to this disease or weakened by infection of viruses. In the recent years tuber losses in Poland balanced from 6 to 45 % (Kapsa & Osowski 2004). In the years 1998 - 2006, {{in cooperation with the}} Plant Health and Seed Inspection Service an evaluation of early blight occurrence on potato crops was carried out throughout Poland. Observations revealed that the disease occurrence on potato crop is common in most production areas, average at 86 % of observed crops. Early blight occurs usually at the end of May or the beginning of June, earlier than late blight which is observed mainly in June. In Polish climatic conditions our recommendations regarding the first chemical treatment for protection of susceptible cultivars indicate that, the appearance of the first disease symptoms on potato leaves, is the optimum time for initiating applications of fungicides. In some <b>countries</b> <b>potato</b> crops are regularly irrigated (USA and the Netherlands) and then the early blight occurs at the end of growing season on aging plants.

Kinetics of quality changes during cooking and frying of potatoes were evaluated. Potatoes were cooked at 80 [...] 100 °C or fried at 160 [...] 190 °C for selected times and their texture and color were evaluated. Results showed that texture values of cooked potatoes decreased with the progress of cooking, and the rate of texture changes at each temperature was found to be consistent with two pseudo first-order kinetic mechanisms. Textural values of fried potatoes increased with frying time and followed a first order kinetic model. Cooked potatoes were less bright, more red and less yellow in color as compared to raw samples. A modified first order model was used to characterize the color changes kinetics of both cooked and fried potatoes based on the changes occurring between the initial and a maximum or minimum value. 10 min cooking at 100 °C and 10 min frying at 180 °C were considered to give the designed cooked and fried products, respectively. The changes in quality characteristics of potatoes as a function of storage variables (temperature and time) were evaluated. Potatoes were stored at five temperatures (4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 °C) for selected duration (at least 5 time intervals) and different physico-chemical quality parameters were evaluated.
