Amy plans to return the toy but changes her mind and leaves. Needing to see Kyle, she persuades Andy to let her take baby Jack to Kyle's playgroup and makes friends with Joanie, telling her that she is {{studying}} childcare and asking if she needs any help with Kyle. Joanie accepts and allows Amy to look after Kyle occasionally. Val is thrilled when she finds out but Victoria and Eric think it is a bad idea and Eric tells Joanie that Amy is Kyle's birth mother.

25|$|In 2013, Representative Callegari {{supported}} {{the ban on}} abortion after twenty weeks of gestation; the measure passed the House, 96-49. He voted for companion legislation to increase medical and licensing requirements of abortion providers, a move which opponents said {{could lead to the}} closure of many abortion clinics in the state. These issues brought forth an unsuccessful filibuster in the Texas State Senate by Wendy R. Davis of Fort Worth, who in 2014 is the Democratic nominee for governor against the Republican Greg Abbott. In 2011, Callegari did not vote on two other anti-abortion measures. One forbids state funding of agencies which perform abortions. The other requires that a woman undergo a sonogram before procuring an abortion. This legislation is based on the view that a woman could <b>change</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> about an abortion once she witnesses the development of the unborn child through the latest technology. The Texas Right to Life Committee, according to Project Vote Smart, rated Callegari 41 percent favorable in 2013, 72 percent in 2011, and 100 percent in 2005. The National Abortion Rights Action League rated him 9 percent in 2005.|$|E

[...] The decision by the committee ultimately ended in a three-way tie between Ream, Stone, and MacDonald. [...] The project stalled until the next Congress convened in 1874.
