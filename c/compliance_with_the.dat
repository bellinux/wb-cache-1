5|$|Principles {{establishing}} legal machinery {{to secure}} <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rule of law.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{important}} principles spring from the basic idea {{of the rule of}} law. These may be divided into two groups: principles that ensure the law is capable of guiding its subjects' behaviour, and principles establishing legal machinery to secure <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rule of law.|$|E
5|$|Patricia McKinsey Crittenden has {{elaborated}} classifications {{of further}} forms of avoidant and ambivalent attachment behaviour. These include the caregiving and punitive behaviours also identified by Main and Cassidy (termed A3 and C3 respectively), but also other patterns such as compulsive <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> wishes of a threatening parent (A4).|$|E

Named after the acid test for gold, it {{was developed in the}} spirit of Acid1, a relatively narrow test of <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Cascading Style Sheets 1.0 (CSS1) standard, and was released on 13 April 2005. As with Acid1, an application passes the test if the way it displays the test page matches a reference image.|$|E
5|$|An {{article in}} Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists {{describes}} how a North Korean underground nuclear test on 25 May 2009 was detected {{and the source}} located by GPS satellites. The authors suggest that the effectiveness of GPS satellites for detecting nuclear explosions enhances the ability to verify <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, giving the United States more reason to ratify it.|$|E

In {{addition to}} notary public, {{he was appointed}} in 1877 to a three-person Board of Appraisers of Lands, and in 1879 as an Agent to Take Acknowledgments to Instruments. He would later resign all three appointments in 1887, to be in <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|CMVs are {{required}} to pass through weigh stations at the borders of most states and some large cities. These weigh stations are run by state DOTs, and CMV weight and size enforcement is overseen by the FHWA. Weigh stations check each vehicle's gross weight and axle weight using a set of in-ground truck scales, and are usually where a truck's <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> formula is checked.|$|E
5|$|<b>Compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> law is checked when {{vehicles}} {{pass through}} a weigh station, often located at the borders between states or {{on the outskirts of}} major cities, where the vehicle may be weighed and measured. The one exception to the formula allows a standard five-axle semi-truck configuration to weigh the maximum legal gross weight. This exception was specifically requested by the American Trucking Associations to allow tank trucks to reach the maximum legal gross weight without violating the bridge formula law.|$|E

5|$|Controversies over shoeing rules, {{concerns}} about soring and the breed industry's <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Horse Protection Act {{has resulted in}} the development of multiple governing organizations. The breed registry is kept by the TWHBEA which promotes all riding disciplines within the breed, but does not sanction horse shows. The USEF does not currently recognize or sanction any Tennessee Walking Horse shows. In 2013 it also banned the use of action devices and stacks at any time in any class.|$|E
5|$|Coughlan {{has been}} criticized for {{allowing}} the doctrine of proportionality to affect administrative law, as the court has to judge the merits of a case when granting a review on grounds of substantive legitimate expectation and, in a sense, usurp the discretion of the executive branch of government. This is arguably inconsistent with the court's traditional role in judicial review which is to avoid examining the merits of administrative decisions and only scrutinize them for <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> law.|$|E

Just hours before the Indonesian invasion of East Timor (now Timor Leste) on December 7, 1975, Ford and Kissinger had visited Indonesian President Suharto in Jakarta and guaranteed American <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Indonesian operation.

With Argentina no longer in <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> conditions of the expanded IMF-supported program, the IMF decided to suspend disbursements. At the end of December, in a climate of severe political and social unrest, the country partially defaulted on its international obligations; in January 2002, it formally abandoned the convertibility regime.|$|E

In 1963, the division's former headquarters company grew into the 1st Brigade, 7th Infantry Division.

5|$|Several {{private and}} public motor {{carriers}} such as Frito-Lay, United Parcel Service, and Werner Enterprises, have voluntarily implemented electronic on-board recorders to ensure drivers are in <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> federal regulations, to reduce the errors and hassles associated with paper log books, and to improve driver retention and recruitment. EOBRs automatically record the driving time and cannot be easily forged. Any violation of the HOS will automatically be recorded and reported to the company. The FMCSA is considering making EOBRs mandatory for all motor carriers.|$|E

These private concerns won at both the trial court and at the Washington Supreme Court. Washington Attorney General Slade Gorton, representing the state of Washington, supported {{the position of the}} private concerns and opposed the position of the United States and the tribes. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and vacated the decision of the Washington Supreme Court.|$|E
