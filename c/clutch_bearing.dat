40|$|The {{goals of}} this thesis {{were to make}} final design {{modifications}} and perform static testing to prepare the Hummingbird, a 150 pound, remotely piloted helicopter (RPH), for untethered flight. The major elements involved were: (1) The adaptation of a suitable, permanently-dedicated test stand for use with large-scale RPH/RPV (remotely piloted vehicle) aircraft; (2) A major rotor drivetrain improvement to the helicopter to enable it to autorotate and safely land {{in the event of}} an in-flight engine failure, thus avoiding potential loss of the helicopter due to crash; (3) Complete break-in and testing of a replacement engine for a mechanically-seized first engine; and (4) Limited hover testing while secured to the tether test stand. Test stand modifications include design and implementation of a compression spring to offset the weight of the new mounting assembly and a restricting collar to confine mobility of the stand's universal joint. The mechanical change to the drivetrain consists of replacement of a conventional belt-drive sprocket with a one-way sprague <b>clutch</b> <b>bearing</b> inside the gear. This provides the Hummingbird with the critical capability to autorotate. The new engine, correctly broken in, and the subsequent static testing provide the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics with an operational platform ready to perform subsequent in-flight testing.

Motivated by their recent use as {{ratchets}} in piezoelectric actuators and decoupling devices in serpentine belt drives, a method of analysis of systems containing oneway clutches is presented.

40|$|A flow {{model of}} the NLS <b>clutching</b> <b>bearing</b> cavity was built for 2 -D {{axisymmetric}} viscous analysis. From the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach, the tangential force exerted on the surfaces of the inner race was integrated to calculate the dividing torque which, {{in conjunction with the}} resistance torque, was used to predict the operating speed of the inner race. In order to further reduce the inner race rotation, the swirling flow at the cavity inlet was partially redirected to generate an opposing torque. Thirty six slanted slots were incorporated into the anti-vortex rib to achieve this goal.

Fatigue life analysis {{is based on}} the release bearing rings or rolling body began to appear fatigue spalling, in which this kind of phenomenon is under cyclic stress. The contact stress distribution is not uniform, the contact stress is mainly concentrated near the surface; influenced by the geometry and physical properties and lubrication of the surface significantly. Contact between the two types of fatigue crack extension methods: fatigue crack surface under expansion and surface fatigue crack propagation. The surface crack growth mainly originated from two kinds of cases: crack caused by surface pre crack and contact between the two surface asperity each other.

50|$|The F23 has two gearsets on each {{of three}} {{parallel}} shafts - the input shaft, the output shaft, and the intermediate shaft. This three-shaft (also called three-axis) design results {{in a very short}} axial length for better packaging. There are three separate shift fork shafts, which hold three shift forks to activate the synchronizer rings for the two gearsets {{on each of}} the three gear shafts. The shift forks are activated by a cable system. The <b>clutch</b> release <b>bearing</b> is operated by a concentric slave cylinder that surrounds the input shaft in the clutch housing. A concentric slave cylinder allows more linear clutch feel than an external lever-actuated <b>clutch</b> and release <b>bearing.</b> The input shaft carries the 3rd and 4th gear synchronizer, the intermediate shaft carries the 1st and 2nd gear synchronizer, and the output shaft carries the 5th and reverse gear synchronizer. The aluminium case contains a conventional final drive gearset.|$|R
5000|$|The VTM-4 system's {{electronic}} control unit (ECU) determines torque {{which is to be}} distributed to the rear wheels, then electric current is sent to the two electromagnetic coils. The resulting magnetic field moves a rotating steel plate toward each fixed coil. Friction between that steel plate and an adjoining cam plate causes the cam plate to begin turning. As it does, three balls per clutch roll up curved ramps, creating an axial thrust against a clutch-engagement plate. This thrust force compresses the wet clutch plates, thereby engaging drive to the corresponding rear wheel. [...] Unlike mechanically actuated four-wheel drive systems, the VTM-4 system is infinitely variable. The amount of torque provided to the rear wheels is directly proportional to the electric current sent from the ECU and can be adjusted from zero to a preset maximum. This current constantly changes to deliver the optimum rear torque calculated by the ECU. An internal gear pump circulates VTM-4 fluid to cool and lubricate the <b>clutches,</b> <b>bearings,</b> and gears within the rear drive unit. Use of high-strength, low-weight materials such as diecast aluminum for the housing minimizes the bulk and weight of this hardware, helping to keep the weight of the entire all-wheel-drive system to about 212-pounds.|$|R

40|$|In Automated Manual Transmissions (AMTs) {{the clutch}} control {{strategies}} {{to manage the}} engagement operation and clutch vibrational behaviour are mutual interdependent and only an optimized mechatronic design could lead to an effective target from several points of view: passengers' comfort, fuel economy, system reliability, performance, driving feeling, etc. In fact, noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) phenomena are crucial subjects in the modern automotive industry. In passenger car equipped with automatic transmissions the electronic management of the coupling between engine and transmission couldn’t provide sensible improvement of comfort and overall vehicle performance during gearshifts without the availability of dependable models of the flywheel, clutch and driveline as powerful tools for vehicle design engineers. In this paper, simulations of driveline vibrational behaviour have been performed by implementing a high-order multi-body model for the dry clutch mechanism {{with the purpose of}} studying the excitation of torsional vibration caused by frictional actions during the slip phase of the clutch engagement in manual or automated manual transmissions. The analysis aims at deepen about the coupling between pressure plate wobbling and torsional motions in order to improve the current understanding of the excitation mechanisms in the frequency region of the so-called “eek noise”, 250 - 500 Hz. The results of this work substantiate that enhancing of torsional motion in the characteristic frequency range of the eek effect occurs in vehicle launch and gear shifting operations regardless of the rigid wobbling motion of the pressure plate. Such outcomes underline the need to include the non-linear characteristic of the clutch cushion spring in the simulation frictional induced vibration originated at clutch level. Simulations of gear-shifting operations have been carried out by applying ramp profiles to the <b>clutch</b> throwout <b>bearing</b> according to the requirements of typical manoeuvres in passenger cars...|$|R
