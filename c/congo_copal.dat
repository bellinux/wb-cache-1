30|$|The {{amount of}} Pinaceae resin {{detected}} in the samples was found to {{vary according to the}} color: white and light-colored paint samples contained less resin than the dark colors (see Fig.  2). In {{the first decades of the}} twentieth century, high gloss enamel paints reportedly comprised drying oils mixed with a semi-fossil resin such as <b>Congo</b> <b>copal</b> and/or a soft resin such as colophony (pine rosin) and good quality opaque pigments; though colophony was regarded as a poor and unstable paint ingredient, it was extensively used in enamel paint manufacture (Mattiello, 228) in mixtures with drying oils and lime or zinc white or glycerol [40]. Because of the perceived tendency of resins to discolor, technical manuals instructed commercial painters to make white and light-colored house paints using raw linseed oil and/or stand oil with very small quantities of resins, if any, whereas the addition of resins in large quantities was strongly recommended for darker colored enamel paints. (Mattiello, 199 – 206) This is in agreement with the findings on the Ripolin paints tested.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} chromatographic analysis of European lacquer, thermochemolysis temperature was evaluated {{for the analysis}} of natural resins. Five main ingredients of lacquer were studied: sandarac, mastic, colophony, Manila copal and <b>Congo</b> <b>copal.</b> For each, five temperature programs were tested: four fixed temperatures (350, 480, 550, 650 degrees C) and one ultrafast thermal desorption (UFD), in which the temperature rises from 350 to 660 degrees C in 1 min. In total, the integrated signals of 27 molecules, partially characterizing the five resins, were monitored to compare the different methods. A compromise between detection of compounds released at low temperatures and compounds formed at high temperatures was searched. 650 degrees C is too high for both groups, 350 degrees C is best for the first, and 550 degrees C for the second. Fixed temperatures of 480 degrees C or UFD proved to be a consensus in order to detect most marker molecules. UFD was slightly better for the molecules released at low temperatures, while 480 degrees C showed best compounds formed at high temperatures...|$|E
