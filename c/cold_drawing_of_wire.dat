40|$|This paper {{presents}} the investigation {{results of the}} electrochemical behavior of copper in 1 M Na 2 CO 3 solution {{in the presence of}} potassium ethyl xanthate (KEtX) with different concentrations. Tests were conducted on copper samples obtained without deformation and with deformation of 83, 91 and 99 %. Samples were obtained by <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire,</b> which was previously obtained by dip-forming procedure. Corrosion behavior of cold deformed copper wire is characterized by its open circuit potential and behavior during anodic polarization. Experiments were carried out in aqueous solution 1 M Na 2 CO 3 with added various amounts of KEtX between 0. 008 g/l and 0. 15 g/l. It was experimentally proved that the degree of deformation between 83 and 99 % does not have a large effect on the open circuit potential, {{as well as on the}} behavior of copper during anodic polarization in 1 M Na 2 CO 3. Voltammograms show no significant differences between peak heights obtained for different electrodes. The first peak which occurs at potential of around - 0. 06 V vs. SCE corresponds to the formation of copper oxide Cu 2 O. The second wide peak is at potential of around 0. 15 V vs. SCE and corresponds to the formation of CuO. Addition of potassium ethyl xanthate in alkaline 1 M Na 2 CO 3 solution changes the mechanism of the process in anodic part, which is reflected in the change of shape of voltammograms. In presence of KEtX in concentration between 0. 008 g/l and 0. 15 g/l on voltammograms a sharp peak appears at potential of about - 0. 2 V vs. SCE and corresponds to the oxidation of xanthate. Current density, which determines the rate of the process which takes place at the electrode surface, yet in the presence of smallest amounts of KEtX (< 0, 08 g/l) is higher than in the absence of KEtX. It allows one to conclude that the processes of oxidation of copper accelerate in presence of potassium ethyl xanthate...|$|E

40|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> steel <b>wires</b> {{leads to}} an {{increase}} of their mechanical strength and to a drop in their ductility. The increase of their mechanical strength has long been related to {{the reduction of the}} various material scales by an intense plastic deformation. Besides, it was discussed in the companion paper that large plastic deformation leads to the loss of the material hardening capabilities and that, in such a case, residual stresses preserve the elongation to failure <b>of</b> <b>wires.</b> Experimental measurements <b>of</b> residual stresses inside the wire have therefore been undertaken. In this paper, lattice parameters as measured using synchrotron diffraction are compared with those calculated using the residual stress fields as determined by the finite-element method. There is a major disagreement between experimental and numerical results that is too large to be attributed to the errors of the finite-element analyses. Therefore, neutron diffraction experiments have also been performed. These measurements show that there is a significant variation of the lattice parameter with the drawing level, which is not inherited from residual stresses, and that variation is very sensitive to the cooling rate after processing. It is therefore proposed that <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> would induce a phase transformation of the steel, possibly a martensitic transformation...|$|R

40|$|In a {{pearlitic}} structure, large deformations {{lead to a}} re-orientation and {{alignment of}} cementite lamellae on the microscopic level. These changes in the microstructure of pearlitic steel under large plastic deformations induce substantial degrees of anisotropy in certain mechanical properties of the material like yield limit, fracture toughness and fatigue threshold values. The alteration and induced directional dependence in these specific properties is equivalent to changes in resistance against initiation and growth of fatigue cracks and as the result influences the fatigue life of the components. In the present work a material model formulated for large strains has been utilized to predict the evolution of anisotropy and to obtain the altered state of stress in the heavily deformed pearlitic steel components. In the developed material model, the macroscopic anisotropy evolution is motivated from homogenization of an ideal pearlitic microstructure. The evolution of anisotropy is modelled via an areal-affine re-orientation. On the microscopic level, material yielding {{is assumed to be}} mainly caused by shearing of the ferrite between the cementite lamellae. This assumption motivates a macroscopic yield criterion that is influenced by the re-orientation of the cementite lamellae. The evolution of anisotropy, thereby, leads to a distortional hardening of the yield surface. Both kinematic and isotropic hardening are included in the model. The material model has been calibrated against some experimental results from both <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> pearlitic steel <b>wires</b> and high pressure torsion tests. Model predictions are later utilized to verify the hardness profiles measured in pearlitic steel railway components which are typically subjected to simultaneous large compressive and shear loads. It is believed that such a model can be further used as a reliable base to develop a crack initiation model for pearlitic steel...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} sources of damage caused by Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF) in railway {{components}} is the large plastic deformations that accumulate in the surface layer of these components. Large plastic deformations in components made of pearlitic steel induce anisotropy in the mechanical properties of the material. The objective of this thesis is to investigate {{the effect of this}} anisotropy on the RCF properties of pearlitic steel components by utilizing material models and computational analysis. The first paper aims at formulating a material model for predicting large irreversible deformations in components made of pearlitic carbon steel. On the microscopic level, pearlitic steel is a two phase material consisting of cementite lamellas and a softer ferrite phase. Large plastic deformations in pearlitic steel lead to a re-orientation and alignment of cementite lamellas in the microstructure. This {{is believed to be the}} main reason for evolution of anisotropy in the material. Therefore, a macroscopic model formulated for large strains is proposed that captures this re-orientation and its influence on the macroscopic yielding of the material. Thereby, the re-orientations lead to distortional hardening of the yield surface. The proposed material model is calibrated against experimental results from <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> pearlitic steel <b>wires</b> reported in the literature. In the second paper, the influence of the anisotropic surface layer on the propagation of cracks in pearlitic rail steel is investigated. Experimental results in the literature have reported significant degrees of anisotropy in fracture toughness and fatigue crack propagation rate in heavily deformed pearlitic structures. Indeed, such an anisotropy should be taken into account when trying to predict the fatigue life of components subjected to large deformations. This anisotropy can also be attributed to the alignment of cementite lamellas in the pearlitic microstructure which results in changes in the resistance against crack propagation in different directions. Micrographs of the surface layer of pearlitic steel rails, tested in a full scale test rig, show a transition from a fully aligned microstructure (a high degree of anisotropy) at the surface, to a randomly oriented lamellar structure (isotropy) at some millimeters from the surface. Based on these observations, an anisotropic fracture surface model is proposed to capture the anisotropic resistance against crack propagation and its dependence on the depth from the surface. The fracture surface model is employed in a computational framework for simulation of propagation of planar cracks. The framework is based on the concept of material forces where the propagation rate is linked to a crack-driving force. The results of simulations show that the characteristics of the surface layer have a substantial influence on the crack path...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Polarization {{modulation}} infrared linear dichroism (PM-IRLD) and ultrarapid-scanning Fourier transform {{infrared spectroscopy}} (URS-FTIR) {{have been used}} to characterize the evolution of molecular orientation and microstructure during and following the step deformation of amorphous poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) above and below its glass transition temperature. The combined use of these techniques allowed a high sensitivity and an unprecedented 10 ms time resolution for the characterization of irreversible polymer deformation using infrared spectroscopy. PM-IRLD results show that the 1410 cm- 1 band of PET, often used as a thickness standard, presents a significant dichroism even at low draw ratios. Using this band, the relaxation kinetics of the phenyl ring was directly shown, for the first time, to be {{similar to that of the}} glycol group in amorphous PET.
