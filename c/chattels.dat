5|$|Candaules was {{completed}} and {{exhibited at the}} Royal Academy in 1830. Etty felt that the moral lesson of the story was that women were not male <b>chattels,</b> and that if men—even their husbands—violated a woman's rights she was within her rights to punish them. However, he made little effort to explain what was, at the time, an unusual view, instead allowing viewers to form their own judgement of the piece. Thus, unusually for a painting of the time, Candaules appears morally highly ambiguous, inviting the viewer to sympathise either with the sexually immoral Candaules, the murderous Nyssia or the voyeuristic Gyges.|$|E
5|$|At about 11pm, the rioters {{arrived at}} the house of the Reverend John Vachell, who, after {{threatening}} to shoot anyone who entered his house, was disarmed when threemen rushed him. He fled on foot {{with his wife and two}} daughters towards Ely. After Vachell had left, the rioters destroyed his goods and <b>chattels</b> and stole some of his silverware. Vachell was later to sue the Hundred of Ely for the damages under the Riot Act. He received over £708 (£), an award which was challenged in the press, as many people complained about the size of the resulting district levies used to pay for it. The rioters then stopped a post-chaise returning with Hugh Robert Evans senior and Henry Martin from a Turnpike Trust meeting in Downham. They robbed Evans of 14shillings (£) before allowing them both to proceed. On reaching Ely, Evans alerted the magistrates who sent a carriage for Reverend Vachell, which collected him and his family walking towards Ely.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June 1940, he saw Marianne and Gil {{off with}} their <b>chattels</b> {{on a train}} to Toulouse, where his sister Guiliana lived with her husband, Duccio Tabet. On 13 June, just a day before the Germans entered Paris, Pontecorvo, his brother Gillo, cousin Emilio Sereni and Salvador Luria set out for Toulouse on bicycles. It took them ten days to reach Toulouse. Luria went to Marseilles, from whence he {{eventually}} {{made his way to}} the United States. Pontecorvo, Marianna, Gil, Guiliana and Tabet boarded a train that took them to Lisbon via Madrid on 19 July 1940. Both women were pregnant. Marianne had a miscarriage, and was hardly fit to travel, but nonetheless boarded the liner Quanza on 9 August 1940 on its voyage bringing refugees to the United States. Both women were seasick. On 19 August 1940, the ship reached New York City, where they stayed with his brother Paolo. While there, he visited Fermi at his new home in Leonia, New Jersey.|$|E
50|$|A person commits {{trespass}} to <b>chattel</b> when he acts either {{intending to}} dispossess the rightful possessor of a <b>chattel</b> or intending to use or intermeddle with the <b>chattel</b> of another and when dispossession of the <b>chattel</b> {{for a substantial}} time results, or damage to the <b>chattel</b> results, or physical injury to the rightful possessor results.|$|R
25|$|Asportation of the <b>chattel</b> (illegally {{transporting}} the <b>chattel)</b> {{which was}} followed by the loss of a <b>chattel,</b> was held not to support an action in trover.|$|R
50|$|Under {{a typical}} <b>chattel</b> mortgage, the {{purchaser}} borrows {{funds for the}} purchase of movable personal property (the <b>chattel)</b> from the lender. The lender then secures the loan with a mortgage over the <b>chattel.</b> Legal ownership of the <b>chattel</b> is transferred to the purchaser at the time of purchase, and the mortgage is removed once the loan has been repaid.|$|R
5|$|The road {{followed}} by Alboin to reach Italy {{has been the}} subject of controversy, as is the length of the trek. According to Neil Christie the Lombards divided themselves into migrational groups, with a vanguard scouting the road, probably following the Poetovio – Celeia – Emona – Forum Iulii route, while the wagons and most of the people proceeded slowly behind because of the goods and <b>chattels</b> they brought with them, and possibly also because they were waiting for the Saxons to join them on the road. By September raiding parties were looting Venetia, but it was probably only in 569 that the Julian Alps were crossed at the Vipava Valley; the eyewitness Secundus of Non gives the date as May 20 or 21. The 569 date for the entry into Italy is not void of difficulties however, and Jörg Jarnut believes the conquest of most of Venetia had already been completed in 568. According to Carlo Guido Mor, a major difficulty remains in explaining how Alboin could have reached Milan on September 3 assuming he had passed the border only in the May of the same year.|$|E
25|$|Disputes between {{legitimate}} lienholding of <b>chattels</b> vs. hostage-loading {{can sometimes}} be averted by the customer including an advanced (before-the-fact) consensual waiver of the mover's right to a lien in the written contract, obligating the moving company to deliver the goods with reasonable dispatch regardless of disputes over payment, and {{failure to do so}} would constitute conversion or trespass to <b>chattels.</b>|$|E
25|$|Property torts involve any {{intentional}} {{interference with}} the property rights of the claimant (plaintiff). Those commonly recognized include trespass to land, trespass to <b>chattels</b> (personal property), and conversion.|$|E
5000|$|One who commits a {{trespass}} to a <b>chattel</b> {{is subject}} to liability to the possessor of the <b>chattel</b> if, but only if, (a) he dispossesses the other of the <b>chattel,</b> or(b) the <b>chattel</b> is impaired as to its condition, quality, or value, or(c) the possessor is deprived {{of the use of}} the <b>chattel</b> for a substantial time, or(d) bodily harm is caused to the possessor, or harm is caused to some person or thing in which the possessor has a legally protected interest.|$|R
50|$|The Court {{explained}} that trespass to <b>chattel</b> {{is a common}} tort that may be committed by intentionally (a) dispossessing another of the <b>chattel,</b> or (b) using or intermeddling with a <b>chattel</b> in possession of another. Such claims may be brought only when the trespasser (a) disposes the other of the <b>chattel,</b> (b) the <b>chattel</b> is impaired as to its condition, quality or value, (c) the processor is deprived {{of the use of}} the <b>chattel</b> for a substantial time, or (d) body harm is caused to the possessor, or harm is caused to some person or thing in which the possessor has a legally protected interest.|$|R
50|$|The {{remedy for}} this {{cause of action}} not only {{requires}} the defendant to pay the plaintiff the full value of the <b>chattel</b> but also is properly considered a forced sale. The plaintiff must tender the defendant the <b>chattel.</b> Therefore, a plaintiff may not elect to pursue this cause of action but instead trespass to <b>chattel,</b> namely {{when he wants to}} keep his <b>chattel</b> despite its potential damage.|$|R
25|$|These cases {{indicate}} that, {{at least}} in California, a plaintiff {{did not have to}} demonstrate any kind of actual interference with the computer system to successfully claim trespass to <b>chattels.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Holdsworth's Case Clayt. 151, pl. 99, 1638, {{an attempt}} {{to bring an action}} in trover for the {{wrongful}} detention of <b>chattels</b> by a bailee failed, because the action sounded in detinue and not trover.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of states have yet to determine the applicability of the trespass to <b>chattels</b> theory, the courts that have addressed the issue have applied Intel and required that the plaintiff demonstrate damage to the computer system. A supreme court in New York in School of Visual Arts v. Kuprewicz denied the defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on the trespass to <b>chattels</b> claim because the plaintiff had alleged actual damage to the functionality of the computer system, which Intel requires; the defendant had sent enough e-mails that it reduced the computer system's functionality and drained the hard drive's memory. The Fourth Circuit in Omega World Travel v. Mummagraphics, Inc. also followed Intel, although this resulted in granting a motion for summary judgment for the defendant because the plaintiff did not allege any actual damage on its computer system. The court clarified that Oklahoma courts have yet to recognize the validity of a trespass to <b>chattels</b> claim based on an electronic intrusion to a computer system, but if it were to recognize it, the plaintiff would need to allege more than nominal damages, which in this case it had not.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chattel</b> {{property}} {{may also}} be adversely possessed, but owing to {{the differences in the}} nature of real and <b>chattel</b> property, the rules governing such claims are rather more stringent, favoring the legal owner rather than the adverse possessor. Claims for adverse possession of <b>chattel</b> often involve works of art.|$|R
2500|$|One who commits a {{trespass}} to a <b>chattel</b> {{is subject}} to liability to the possessor of the <b>chattel</b> if, but only if, ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{theory of}} trover {{was that the}} defendant, by [...] "converting" [...] the <b>chattel</b> to his own use, had {{appropriated}} the plaintiff's property, {{for which he was}} required to make compensation. The plaintiff was not required to accept the <b>chattel</b> when it was tendered back to him. He could recover damages for the full value of the <b>chattel</b> at the time and place of conversion. The effect was that the defendant was compelled to buy the <b>chattel</b> at a forced sale, carried out by means of an action in trover.|$|R
25|$|The {{trespass}} to <b>chattels</b> tort punishes {{anyone who}} substantially {{interferes with the}} use of another's personal property, or <b>chattels.</b> Plaintiffs must show that the offender had intentional physical contact with the chattel and that the contact caused some substantial interference or damage. The courts that imported this common law doctrine into the digital world reasoned that electrical signals traveling across networks and through proprietary servers may constitute the contact necessary to support a trespass claim. Applying this common law action to computer networks, plaintiffs must first prove that they received some type of electronic communication (typically bulk e-mail or spam) that the defendant intentionally sent to interfere with the plaintiff's interest in his or her property and second that this communication caused a quantifiable harm to their tangible property, such as impaired functioning of the computer, network or server.|$|E
25|$|On 19/29NovemberO.S./N.S. the Commission's subdelegates, Jacob Brummer and Wilhelm Schröder, {{arrived at}} Himmelpforten Convent {{in order to}} sight the {{situation}} there. Much of the <b>chattels</b> had been plundered by the Leaguists since their invasion. The lifestock then counted four horses, two cows and one calf, 15 fattening pigs, 25 breeding pigs, five piglets and uncounted geese, ducks and chickens.|$|E
25|$|Intentional torts are any {{intentional}} {{acts that}} are reasonably foreseeable to cause harm to an individual, and that do so. Intentional torts have several subcategories, including tort(s) against the person, including assault, battery, false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and fraud. Property torts involve any intentional {{interference with the}} property rights of the claimant. Those commonly recognised include trespass to land, trespass to <b>chattels,</b> and conversion.|$|E
50|$|Detinue {{allows for}} a remedy of damages {{for the value of}} the <b>chattel,</b> but unlike most other {{interference}} torts, detinue also allows for the recovery of the specific <b>chattel</b> being withheld.|$|R
50|$|The early writ of detinue was {{specifically}} designed for recovery of a <b>chattel</b> wrongfully detained, but not an action to recover loss due to a <b>chattel</b> being harmed while the defendant had it.|$|R
25|$|Historically, {{the range}} of occupations and status {{positions}} held by <b>chattel</b> slaves has been nearly as broad as that held by free persons, indicating some similarities between <b>chattel</b> slavery and wage slavery as well.|$|R
25|$|I {{bequeath}} to my dear grandson ALEXANDER all {{the rest}} of my property, houses, and land, with the appurtenances thereto, stock, crop, and <b>chattels</b> of every kind. The money arising from the sale of the property devised to him to be subject to the payment by my said grandson ALEXANDER T. STEWART of an annuity to his grandmother, MARTHA STEWART, of three guineas a year during her life.|$|E
25|$|His next {{attempt at}} {{a life of crime}} was {{similarly}} unsuccessful. Squire stole 5 hens and 4 cocks and diverse other goods and <b>chattels</b> from John Stacey's yard, just when the British Government needed people for the transported convict program. On 11 April 1785, he was sentenced to join the First Fleet at the General Sessions of the Peace for the Town & Hundred of Kingston upon Thames, England. Squire was sentenced to 7 years transportation, beyond the seas.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{receipts}} {{of funds}} from the federal government, states and territories have their own taxes, in many cases as slightly different rates. State taxes commonly include payroll tax levied on businesses, a poker-machine tax on businesses that offer gambling services, land tax on people and businesses that own land and most significantly, stamp duty on sales of land (in every state) and other items (<b>chattels</b> in some states, unlisted shares in others, and even sales of contracts in some states).|$|E
5000|$|In {{the time}} of Bracton, despite the {{generality}} of the writ, the bailor of a <b>chattel</b> could only bring this action against the bailee of the <b>chattel,</b> or those who represent the bailee by testate or intestate succession. Only two actions were available. The plaintiff could claim, [...] "I lost the goods and you found them."; or [...] "I bailed the <b>chattel</b> to you." [...] The first of these was called detinue sur trover.|$|R
40|$|This Article {{begins to}} correct the view that <b>chattel</b> {{mortgage}} acts began in the northeastern United States. First, this Article investigates whether Spanish law recognized <b>chattel</b> mortgages against third persons. Finding that Spanish law did, this Article then examines whether Spanish officials developed any filing requirements for them. Concluding that these officials did not, this Article next delineates the application of this law in the various Spanish-Borderland provinces. Several of these provinces, at various times, did have filing requirements for some types of <b>chattel</b> mortgages, contrary to the Spanish law otherwise applicable. Next, this Article investigates the survival or replacement of these <b>chattel</b> mortgage acts under the Anglo-American regime. Finally, this Article provides the source for the colonial Spanish <b>chattel</b> mortgage acts-namely, the effort to eradicate English smuggling in a newly acquired province and thereby render the province a viable component in the Spanish mercantile system...|$|R
5|$|Modern historiographical {{practice}} {{distinguishes between}} <b>chattel</b> slavery (personal possession, where the slave {{was regarded as}} a piece of property as opposed to a mobile member of society) versus land-bonded groups such as the penestae of Thessaly or the Spartan helots, who were more like medieval serfs (an enhancement to real estate). The <b>chattel</b> helot is an individual deprived of liberty and forced to submit to an owner, who may buy, sell, or lease them like any other <b>chattel.</b>|$|R
25|$|Meston {{relished the}} upending of {{cherished}} Western fiction clichés {{and felt that}} few Westerns gave any inkling of how brutal the Old West was in reality. Many episodes were based on man's cruelty to man and woman, inasmuch as the prairie woman's life and the painful treatment of women as <b>chattels</b> were touched on well ahead {{of their time in}} most media. As originally pitched to CBS executives, this was to be an adult Western, not a grown-up Hopalong Cassidy.|$|E
25|$|Trespass and trover {{were both}} actions founded upon possession. For many centuries, they were {{alternative}} remedies for the wrongful taking of, or damage to <b>chattels.</b> There was {{a distinction between}} the actions. In the theory of trespass, the plaintiff remained the owner of the chattel, with the possession or property rights interrupted or interfered with. In this case, the plaintiff must accept the chattel back when it was tendered. Recovery was limited to any damage to the chattel, or from the interruption of property rights.|$|E
25|$|It was {{doubtful}} whether detinue lay where, after bailment, a {{third party}} had destroyed the chattel bailed. This could be encountered when ships were lost at sea, or <b>chattels</b> being moved by wagon were destroyed by acts {{of nature and the}} like. Other cases might involve the finding or bailment of clothing which were destroyed while in the possession of a bailee. The case of a horse bailed to a smith, who bailed it to another smith who damaged, or killed the horse was encountered with some frequency. Action could not lie against the first smith. Contrary opinion is found in a ruling by Stratham.|$|E
