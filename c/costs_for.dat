However, DOE's SunShot Initiative has reported much lower U.S. installation prices. In 2014, prices continued to decline. The SunShot Initiative modeled U.S. system prices {{to be in the}} range of $1.80 to $3.29 per watt. Other sources identify similar price ranges of $1.70 to $3.50 for the different market segments in the U.S., and in the highly penetrated German market, prices for residential and small commercial rooftop systems of up to 100kW declined to $1.36 per watt (€1.24/W) by the end of 2014. In 2015, Deutsche Bank estimated <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> small residential rooftop systems in the U.S. around $2.90 per watt. <b>Costs</b> <b>for</b> utility-scale systems in China and India were estimated as low as $1.00 per watt.|$|E

As cloud computing thrives, the energy consumption and <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> IDCs are exploding.

In this paper we study how to leverage both geographic and temporal variation of energy price to minimize energy <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> distributed IDCs. To this end, we propose a novel spatio-temporal load balancing approach. Using reallife electricity price and workload traces, extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed spatio-temporal load balancing approach significantly reduces energy <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> distributed IDCs.

50|$|However, if we {{implement}} this algorithm we discover {{that it is}} just as slow as the naive way of trying all permutations! What went wrong? The answer is that we're doing a lot of redundant work. For example, above we made a recursive call to find the best <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> computing both ABC and AB. But finding the best <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> computing ABC also requires finding the best <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> AB.
