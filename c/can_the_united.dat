5000|$|The Nixon Administration {{removed the}} Senkakus from its {{inclusion}} {{in the concept of}} Japanese [...] "residual sovereignty" [...] in presenting the Okinawa Reversion Treaty to the U.S. Senate for ratification. On 20 October 1971, Secretary of State William Rogers sent a letter to U.S Congress. In his letter, Acting Assistant Legal Adviser Robert Starr stated [...] "The United States believes that a return of administrative rights over those islands to Japan, from which the rights were received, can in no way prejudice any underlying claims. The United States cannot add to the legal rights Japan possessed before it transferred administration of the islands to us, nor <b>can</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, by giving back what it received, diminish the rights of other claimants... The United States has made no claim to the Senkaku Islands and considers that any conflicting claims to the islands are a matter for resolution by the parties concerned." [...] Several experts have attributed this Nixon Administration policy shift as having been influenced by White House overtures to China during 1971-1972, culminating in the Nixon visit to China.|$|E

5000|$|Eric Henry Monkkonen (August 17, 1942 in Kansas City, Missouri - May 30, 2005 in Culver City, California) was an American {{urban and}} social science {{historian}} who conducted authoritative studies {{on the history of}} crime as well as urban development. His work produced evidence that countered and overturned many assumptions, such as that crime rates are higher in urban areas, and increased during post-war periods and economic downturns. His works on the history of crime in several cities were extensive, cataloging close to every recorded homicide in New York City since 1798, and every homicide in Los Angeles since 1827, and conducting extensive studies on several more cities, primarily in the Western world. At one time he believed that murder was largely [...] "a problem of men", and that [...] "If men take charge of anything ... it must be of the notion that real men don't kill, that self-respect means shrugging off an insult, and that the better manliness accrues to him who does not fight. Other countries have done this, and so <b>can</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States." ...|$|E
5000|$|During the 1980s and 1990s the United States President George H. Bush pledged {{solidarity}} with Gorbachev, but never brought his administration into supporting Gorbachev's reform. In fact, [...] "no bailout for Gorbachev" [...] was a consistent policy {{line of the}} Bush Administration, further demonstrating the lack of true support from the West. President Bush had a financial policy to aid perestroika that was shaped by a minimalist approach, foreign-policy convictions that set Bush up against other U.S. internal affairs, and a frugal attitude, all influencing his unwillingness to aid Gorbachev. Other factors influenced the West's lack of aid as well like [...] "the in-house Gorbi-skeptics" [...] advocacy, the expert community's consensus about the undesirability of rushing U.S. aid to Gorbachev, and strong opposition to any bailout at many levels, including foreign-policy conservatives, the U.S. Congress, and the American public at large. The West seemed to miss an opportunity to help reform the Soviet regime into a more democracy-like society. The Soviets aided in the expansion of Western capitalism to allow for an inflow of Western investments, but the perestroika managers failed. President Bush {{had the opportunity to}} aid the Soviet Union in a chance to improve their government, like Harry S. Truman did for Western Europe. Early on, as perestroika was getting under way, I felt like the West might come along and find it a sensible thing to do—easing Russia's difficult transition from totalitarianism to democracy. What I had in mind in the Preface iv first place, was the participation the West in conversion of defense industries, the modernization of light and food industries, and Russia's inclusion on an equal-member footing in the frameworks of the international economic relations…Unlike some democrats, I did not expect [...] "manna from Heaven," [...] but counted on the Western statesmen to use their common sense.President George H. Bush continued to dodge helping the Russians and the President of Czechoslovakia, Vaclav Havel, laid bare the linkage for the Americans in his address to a joint session of Congress on February 21, 1990: …I often hear the question: How <b>can</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States of America help us today? My reply is as paradoxical as the whole of my life has been: You can help us most of all if you help the Soviet Union on its irreversible, but immensely complicated road to democracy. ...The sooner, the more quickly, and the more peacefully the Soviet Union begins to move along the road toward genuine political pluralism, respect for the rights of nations to their own integrity and to a working—that is a market—economy, the better it will be, not just for Czechs and Slovaks, but for the whole world.|$|E
