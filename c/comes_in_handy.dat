5|$|The Knight on c6 {{is safer}} than on g6, and is well-placed {{as part of}} a general {{strategy}} to control the central dark squares. It can go to d4 while the other Knight can go to c5 via a6 or d7. After 6.Nf3 Bc5 White has difficulties castling short, because the plan to exchange the dark-squared bishops with Bd3/Qe2/Be3 can be met by Bg4/Nd4 to muddy the waters. As Lalic points out:White can no longer castle kingside and will usually have to go the other way. However, this is rather slow and gives Black time to try to undermine the white centre. To this end Bc8–g4 often <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>handy,</b> in order to pin the white knight on f3 against the white queen. Note that Black should wait until his opponent has wasted a tempo with Qe2.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Swindoll of Monsters and Critics.com {{repeated}} many of {{the same}} sentiments in his review of the film. He hated the characters within the first five minutes of the film and found himself wishing that the film had shown more of the bear just walking in the woods rather than the characters talking with one another between the attacks. Matt Gamble of UGO Entertainment was excited by the film's cover, but was also quickly disappointed by [...] "insipid dialog" [...] amongst the characters and their continuously calling each other [...] "dude." [...] The characters actually asking what a bear was doing in the Canadian wilderness, where bears are plentiful, amused him, though he notes that it was probably not the intended reaction for the scene. His final rating of the film was an [...] "F." [...] DVD Verdict's David Johnson also questioned why the bear and actors are never seen on screen together. He derided the scenes in which the bear would make a swiping motion, and the scene would cut to show a character flying through the air: [...] "I don't know how the bear mastered the art of jujitsu in the wild, but it <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> when four teenagers snuff your cub and they need a healthy dose of comeuppance." [...] He also wondered at the lack of fake blood or props being used during attacks rather than [...] "ridiculous blood splatter computer graphics tossed on the screen." [...] Multiple critics noted that the film introduced two potentially interesting subplots that ended up being pointless as the film never explored either, and they all agreed that the film had excellent picture quality.|$|E

2500|$|Mallory Eva Grace– Jared and Simon's 13-year-old sister.

This skill <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> when defending herself against goblins in The Seeing Stone.

She dislikes being caught unawares and [...] "being bossed-around by faeries", and often lets herself show her deep affection for her siblings despite herself.|$|E

Charlie Prince would go on to have a cult following, with articles about him in Fandom, Live Journal and Yuletide. Sales of Charlie Prince's attire increased and he was ranked #50 in UGO Best Second-In-Commands, saying that [...] "Stepping up to fill Ben Wade's shoes is tough business, but that's the task the psycho cowboy Charlie Prince was left with when his bank robbing leader was wrangled by the po-lice.

Sean and Bruce become friends and work together to establish alternative treatment programs for youthful offenders (such as [...] "Gun 101"), and Sean is revealed in one episode as an avid karaoke singer, which <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> for entertaining the guests at Amy's and Stuart's wedding (which does not quite come off).

2500|$|Though {{she looks}} sixteen, Fanta is {{actually}} 172 years old (since one Avalon year is about 10 earth years). She can be manipulative, especially since her innocent and sweet appearances allows others to trust her. Despite the handicap {{of being a}} half-faerie, Fanta is extremely powerful, and was even able to summon a master class gown {{in the middle of}} a magical battle against her rival Medea and the exiled god Neptune, despite the fact such a feat should have been impossible. Fanta likes life in the mortal realm so much she completely torn her dress in half to stay longer, which was why summoning a master class dress was such an impressive feat, considering how badly her regular dress was damaged. Beyond her impressive magical powers, Fanta is very agile and strong, something that <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> more than once while fighting evil affinities. [...] Furthermore, her body possesses the unique quality of being to absorb, store, and then release vast amounts of magical energy. [...] Because the power was dangerous, it was sealed off when Fanta was very young and she undid the seal only when Oreadia's life was threatened. [...] This quality is shared by the King of Avalon and one of the primary reasons why he wants to marry her; since both he and Oreadia noticed this aspect of Fanta before it was sealed off, Fanta has become instrumental in both their plans.|$|E
