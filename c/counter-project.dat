40|$|During the 1970 ’s, {{dissatisfaction with}} Brussels’ urban {{development}} was voiced {{by a series}} of <b>counter-projects</b> set up by the Atelier de Recherche et d’Action Urbaines (ARAU), which managed to garner public support and even to prevent some planned projects. The architecture institute La Cambre, which by then had turned towards a socially engaged pedagogy, served as an intellectual breeding ground and as a reservoir of image-producing students. As history was the source of inspiration for ARAU’s counterproposals, the Archives d’Architecture Moderne (AAM) also {{played a crucial role in}} their success by generating a fast pace of exhibitions and a steady flow of publications. By the mid- 70 ’s, these three institutions – ARAU, La Cambre and AAM – formed a mutually supporting triumvirate, with Maurice Culot as the pivotal figure, leaving its impact on Brussels. “Nous ne laisserons pas à la droite bourgeoise le monopole du passéisme” – 1977. These words by Culot in the journal of AAM illustrate ARAU’s well-known mobilization of history in their <b>counter-projects</b> (Doucet 2013), but also entail the search for a socialist architecture rooted in their Western condition, as well as a positioning towards architecture in socialist countries. This paper aims to trace this implicit positioning by means of AAM’s (traveling) exhibitions and publishing activities: a 1975 reinterpretation of the Italian Architettura Razionale exhibition, a 1976 discussion between Culot and Léon Krier on the form of socialist architecture and a 1977 episode of interest in the Soviet avant-garde of the 1920 ’s. This paper’s overview reveals how this group from La Cambre looked to the east (often via the south: via editors like Éditions l’Âge d’Homme in Switzerland), recuperating ideas and mobilizing them to legitimize their view on history – one rooted in local tradition and local people – and thus trying to defend a conservative historicist architecture from the left side of the political spectrum. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the underlying class dynamics of cur-rent political-economic policymaking {{at the global}} level, {{with a view to}} laying bare the class politics of mainstream market-oriented analysis. To this end, we read the texts of leading economists and policy-makers whose work has been highly influential in the formation of government policy in North America and Western Europe as a guide to the politics of eco-nomic restructuring, and to determine how class analysis and even class antagonism are embedded in – and indeed consti-tutive of – the theoretical and political discourses of high-level policy-makers and advisors. For some twenty years a major subject for social analysis and critical theory has been the re-organization of political and economic gover-nance since the collapse of national-based Keynesian projects in the early to mid 1970 s. Rooted predominantly on the Left of the political spec-trum, this work has sparked extensive debate about the origins, nature and pace of restructuring, the implications of that restructuring for var-ious groups, and the organization (or lack thereof) of <b>counter-projects.</b> But while the debate has been taken place primarily within the Left, th...|$|R

Their clothing tells a story to the audience before any words are spoken and before any action takes place. As a Costume Designer and Lecturer, my awareness of costuming as an anthropological practice has led me to explore these principles using myself as the subject of scrutiny. For one year I am logging every clothing combination I go through along with memories, prices, locations and dates etc. in order to explore the clothing decisions I make and the stories, embedded in my clothes, that I am surrounded by every day. What does my wardrobe mean to me inwardly and reveal outwardly to others? How does this ‘me-search’ extend my artistic practice? The Wear Project will be a visual archive, a teaching tool, and a foundation for further academic research/writing through the questions it raises about design, visual storytelling, memory, dress and audience: a personal interrogation generating a critical framework for understanding the dramaturgical significance of costume. I welcome any interest, suggestions, questions, provocations, conversations or <b>counter-projects</b> that could lead my research, costume design or performance related teaching in general into unexplored areas.

50|$|The {{public space}} {{occupies}} {{the site of}} the old Condado Convention Center built in the 1970's and became one of the components of the controversial Condado Trio project. El Condado was built over decades with private hotels, apartments and high rise condominiums so that access to the beach and view of the ocean was only possible under difficult circumstances. In the late 1990's the three choice properties on Ashford Avenue - the Convention Center and the Vanderbilt and La Concha Hotels were closed and in state of disrepair. The Government of Puerto Rico proposed remodelling the Vanderbilt Hotel and demolishing the Condado Convention Center and La Concha. The Government awarded the project's development to a US-based hotel consortium which proposed to build an all-inclusive hotel and condominium resort at this location. The case became a political issue and was the subject of protests and challenges by the local community, the College of Architects and the Municipality of San Juan. Finally a <b>counter-project</b> proposed by the Municipality of San Juan based on the revitalisation of the two landmark hotels {{and the creation of a}} central public space, La Ventana al Mar, was approved and constructed.|$|E
40|$|From a regulationist perspective, {{this paper}} wants to analyse under which {{preconditions}} local and nacional modes of development can diverge. Taking the modern history of Vienna and Austria as an example, the paper analyses the dialectics of accumulation strategies and nacional and local state projects. There {{can be distinguished}} four relevant historical períods. With regard to the convergence resp. divergence of local and nacional state projects, the two rather stable and the two rather instable períods stand {{in marked contrast to}} each other. The more general conclusion that can be derived from the Viennese experience is that a heterogeneous regional development is only a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for a local state project to diverge from the nacional one. It seems that popular forces can only establish a <b>counter-project</b> at the local level if the nacional dominant bloc fails to gain mass acceptance for its ideological dispensation and an emerging counter bloc is able to capitalise on this weakness by formulating its own social project.

40|$|My paper {{focuses on}} the {{corporeal}} discourse in James Joyce’s Ulysses, called by the author "the epic of the human body". I use Foucault’s category of the ancient "regimens" of diet and sexuality; according to The History of Sexuality those referred {{not so much to}} medical recommendations as to the art of living. The paper claims that the concept of regimens was still alive in the Modernist culture. For Nietzsche, physiology was a fundamental science and his whole anthropology was built upon it. The management of body functions, dietetic schemes, walks and the choice of a proper climate were essential for his philosophy of life. The paper defines Bloom’s corporeal regimen in Ulysses as one that celebrates the body and affirms life in its material forms. Bloom’s relaxed rules on sexuality and consumption and his joyful glorification of the material world (as in chapter four where he prepares a kidney and chapter seventeen where he opens two drawers that – among other things – include a variety of objects and representations of the human body) {{can be seen as a}} Modernist <b>counter-project</b> to the disciplining “ascetic ideals” of the Christian tradition...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to unravel and interrogate critically the recent histories of the production and reproduction of Castlefield, Manchester. This unravelling is accomplished theoretically through the historicised application of Lefebvre‘s spatial triad. Production of space histories and Castlefield‘s 'regeneration‘ are revisited principally through archival and interview evacuations of the neglected years of the 1970 s. Urban public space is seen as the key city synecdoche. The thesis argues against what is called the 'dominant academic narrative‘: challenging the narrative where it ignores or downplays the role of counter-representations and <b>counter-projects</b> in the production of urban public space. The empirical research is based mainly on archival data and complimentary interview and visual data; the analyses are qualitative. Visual representations of space largely neglected in the literature are foregrounded throughout the empirical research. Spaces of representation and spatial practice are interrogated from the perspective of public space analysis which emphasises the importance of the contested nature of representations of space within the public sector and the vulnerable and unstable character of some official representations of space. The thesis therefore does not seek to reproduce what might be called a 'traditional‘ Lefebvrian analysis which counter-poses repressive official representations of space against quotidian heroic, poetic spaces of representation. The research challenges oversimplified characterisations of Castlefield as a space simply of heritage, leisure and exclusive residential enclaves. A dynamic, complex spatial portrait is revealed whereby ludic, 'natural‘ and abstract space rise and fall though intricate spatial layering as time unfolds. Urban differential space and ludic space are found to emerge through the interstices of abstract space as key outcomes of the contestation of space. The thesis concludes that the potential for differential urban public space exists through the production of new spaces and their diverse politicised appropriation.

By the mid- 70 ’s, these three institutions – ARAU, La Cambre and AAM – formed a mutually supporting triumvirate, with Maurice Culot as the pivotal figure, leaving its impact on Brussels. Within this constellation, the AAM’s Bulletin d’Information started publication in October 1975 – at the height of Culot’s influence at La Cambre. It served to disseminate the group’s historicist view on architecture, argued for from a socialist perspective, rooted in the local situation of Brussels, and framed in the class struggle. Parallel to their fierce opposition to functionalism, their editorial statements opposed the perceived lack of architectural criticism in the Belgian press and did so by seeking alliances on an international level, with journals like Architecture d’Aujourd’hui. By 1980, the Culot-team was expelled from La Cambre and the periodical toned down its polemical stance, yet stayed an important journal for the discipline for ten more years. This paper investigates the role of this periodical in advocating a certain architectural stance, by focusing on the specific format of the editorial text, which allows for a theoretical argument being construed over a larger timespan. The recurrent editorial creates a continuous discourse, yet in each contribution the argument is actualized, reformulated and refined by the different key figures of the organization: Culot, Léon Krier, René Schoonbrodt and others. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} political {{foundations of the}} city. It positions itself around a definition {{of the idea of}} the political, which is determined by the specific constitution of opposed entities; a dichotomy between a sovereign body and movements. Subsequently, the research suggests a dialectical reading of the idea of Urban Form, which is built upon the relation between norm and exception, between friendship and enmity, inclusion and exclusion. Departing from this definition, the dissertation stresses on the (constructive) dynamism of opposing forces which motivate or shape a creative tension: the state of antithetical, which becomes spatialised {{in the form of the}} city. This political understanding of the concept of the city has always been entangled with theological polemics. In this dissertation, the very notion of separation, that is embedded in theology, becomes the core concept when an ideological power aims at defining itself through the act of exclusion. Walls, enclosures and boundaries are the architectural elements that represent this action. However here the idea of separation does not imply a form of rejection but rather an association. Camp of Faith rereads these peculiar urban forms as political repercussions of theological ideas, when the city’s architecture establishes a relationship between power, inhabitants and territory. These spatial configurations mediate the moment of conflict, when opposing forces collide and projects are initiated in a dialectical process. Cities become laboratories of projects and <b>counter-projects.</b> Nevertheless the research’s ambition rests in the architectural quality of such phenomena, not only reading the architecture as an outcome of a deliberate political act but also when political ideas and ideologies emerge from the very architecture of the city. Camp of Faith relies on the close reading of paradigmatic examples that unfold the theological idea of city beyond the limits of time and geography. Therefore, here, the concern is not so much changing stylistic periods, but rather the issue of continuity; a specific conception of space which has remained constant despite the advent of technological and economic development: reading the city as series of inhabitable walls.

The main topics of this revision were “space provided for waters”, structural restoration and the refurbishment of hydropower (including fish migration). Therefore the Cantonal authorities were obligated to do a “strategic planning” until 2014 and the necessary funding mechanisms were established. The operators of hydropower plants are fully compensated for the necessary measurements by a consumer-paid fund which is raised by 0. 1 Rp. /kWh. Until {{the end of the}} time-limit (2030) totally 1 Billion SFr. will be invested in the refurbishment of hydropower in Switzerland. During the planning-phase the Cantons identified approximately 1000 hydropower based obstacles to need remediation (Upstream as well as downstream migration resp. fish protection). The strategic restoration plans and the (financial) -requests of the operators have to be authorized by the national regulating office, which is presenting an overview of the new legislation, the major findings of the strategic planning and some first examples of measurement taken...|$|E
40|$|The title “The Visible Hand of European Regulatory Private Law” {{should make}} clear what I {{identify}} {{to be the}} major gap not only in political discourse but also in legal doctrine and in legal theory concerning European private law and where I hope to bring additional expertise which is so far missing. My hypothesis is that the “modernisation” of (or more cautiously changes to) private law derives from those subject matters which are at the boundaries of traditional private law. So what I will try to develop {{is some sort of}} a <b>counter-project</b> to the acquis principles and the Draft Common Frame of Reference (understood as a coherent body of European private law rules), a model which leaves room for national private legal orders, but takes into consideration the ongoing process of Europeanisation, be it via academia in the study group and the acquis group, via the European legislator or via soft-law building. The multi-level structure of the European Community calls for a concept that allows one to determine which norms shall be elaborated and enforced at what level and by whom. What I have in mind is a structural new-orientation of (European) private law, which takes into account the transformation of European private law from autonomy to functionalism in competition and regulation...|$|E

That, at the time when this private verbal agreement was made by the said Warren Hastings with the Nabob of Oude, a public ostensible treaty was concluded by him with the said Nabob, {{in which there is no}} mention whatever of such agreement, or reference whatever to it: in defence of which omission, it is asserted by the said Warren Hastings, that the multiplication of treaties weakens their efficacy, and therefore they should be reserved only for very important and permanent obligations; notwithstanding he had previously declared to the said Nabob, [...] "that the points which he had proposed required much consideration, and the previous ratification of a formal agreement, before he could consent to them." [...] That the whole of the said verbal agreement with the Nabob of Oude in his own person, without any assistance on his part, was carried on and concluded by the said Warren Hastings alone, without any person who might witness the same, without the intervention even of an interpreter, though he confesses that he spoke the Hindostan language imperfectly, and although he had with him at that time and place several persons high in the Company's service and confidence, namely, the commander-in-chief of their forces, two members of their Council, and the Secretary to the Council, who were not otherwise acquainted with the proceedings between him and the said Nabob than by such communications as he thought fit to make to them.|$|R
