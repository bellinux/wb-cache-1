Enzymes are usually very specific as to what substrates they bind and then the chemical reaction catalysed.

5|$|A frontal trough moved eastward off {{the southeastern}} United States on September30, {{becoming}} stationary north of Haiti. The trough developed {{an area of}} disturbed weather that interacted with an upper-level low pressure area, resulting {{in the development of}} a subtropical depression on October7. Upon formation, the system consisted of a very broad subtropical low, as well as a poorly defined surface circulation. As the subtropical depression drifted westward, it became further organized. By midday on October8, an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft flight indicated that the subtropical depression intensified and acquired enough tropical <b>characteristics</b> <b>to</b> be considered a tropical storm. The National Hurricane Center named the storm Josephine.|$|E

5|$|Attorneys {{have long}} used {{peremptory}} challenges to exclude undesirable prospective jurors, {{but have not}} always been successful. Much of the early efforts were based on lawyers' folklore about who makes a good juror for their case. Early examples of scientific jury selection were similar. For example, in the 1975 Joan Little trial, defense attorneys used an astrologer to help choose the jury. More rigorous methodology was on display during the first major use of SJS, the 1972 Harrisburg Seven trial. During that trial, social scientists used demographic <b>characteristics</b> <b>to</b> identify biases in favor of conviction. The consultants in the case had conducted surveys that indicated women and Democrats would make defense-friendly jurors, and the religious, those with college degrees, and Reader's Digest subscribers would be better for the prosecution. Although surveys had indicated that 80% of citizens in conservative Harrisburg, Pennsylvania would convict the defendants, they were acquitted of all serious charges.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{continued}} designs {{and interest in}} the idea, no funding was ever appropriated {{for the construction of}} a flight-deck cruiser; in addition, evaluation of the design by the Naval War College determined that even a 12,000-ton ship was too small for the concept's intended <b>characteristics</b> <b>to</b> be effectively realized, and thus the ship would be ineffective in battle. In 1940, the design was formally shelved, although provision was made for reconsideration of the concept at a future date. The entry of the United States into World War II following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, however, removed the primary justifications for the concept of a hybrid warship, as naval limitations treaties were now moot and adequate funding was now available for the construction of more conventional ships. As a result, the flight deck cruiser concept was never revisited.|$|E
5|$|Edward Drinker Cope {{described}} his finds in two 1878 {{issues of the}} American Naturalist, and assigned them to the new genus Amphicoelias. He placed it in a unique family, Amphicoeliidae, though this is now considered a nomen oblitum (forgotten name). The genus is usually assigned to the family Diplodocidae, though some modern analyses have found it {{at the base of}} the larger group Diplodocoidea or as a diplodocid incertae sedis (uncertain placement). The first named species in the genus, Amphicoelias altus (holotype specimen AMHD 5764), was discovered by Cope in 1877. But while it is only represented by a partial skeleton, there are enough diagnostic <b>characteristics</b> <b>to</b> provisionally define the genus. A. altus is known from better remains, but is smaller than A. fragillimus. Cope also named a second species in 1878: Amphicoelias latus.|$|E

5|$|Evolution of Tappanaga, the endemic, larger form of short-finned pilots {{found in}} {{northern}} Japan, with similar <b>characteristics</b> <b>to</b> the whales found along Vancouver Island and northern USA coasts, have been {{indicated that the}} geniture of this form could be caused by the extinction of long-finned pilots in north Pacific in the 12th century where Magondou, the smaller, southern type possibly filled the former niches of long-finned pilots, adapting and colonizing into colder waters. Some claims that the Tappanaga, alternatively called Shiogondou, are not adapted form of short-finned pilots but a distinctive species of their own. Today, Tappanaga and Magondou differentiate their respective distributions by the border at around the oceanic front off Chōshi, Chiba.|$|E

He rejected the practice of homeopathy, an alternative to the scientific medicine being taught in universities. Although he had a successful medical career, he was not admitted to the American Medical Association or local associations because of racial discrimination.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Karl {{originated}} {{in a low}} pressure area that formed along a frontal boundary near the southeastern United States. It approached the Canadian Maritimes {{the next day and}} strengthened to below 1000 millibars. On November 24, the broad cyclone was located south of Newfoundland, and early the next day a mass of convection developed near the core. It evolved into a separate vortex, and {{due to the lack of}} inhibiting wind shear, a small cyclone developed. It became a subtropical storm at 0000 UTC before executing a tight counterclockwise loop as it rotated within the larger cyclone. About 18 hours later, the storm strengthened and gained enough tropical <b>characteristics</b> <b>to</b> be designated a hurricane, accompanied by the formation of a pronounced eye feature. At the time, it was situated around 610miles (1,110km) west-southwest of the Azores. Although the development of a tropical cyclone within a non-tropical storm is rare, it is not unprecedented. An unnamed hurricane in November 1991 also formed in this manner.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Norman {{included}} Eolambia for {{the first}} time in a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of iguanodonts, as part of a chapter focusing on iguanodonts in the second edition of The Dinosauria. He found that Eolambia was the sister group to Altirhinus, with both of them being more basal than Protohadros, Probactrosaurus, or the Hadrosauridae. Within the same volume, Horner, Weishampel, and Catherine Forster conducted a separate phylogenetic analysis of hadrosaurids, likewise including Eolambia. They found Eolambia again as a non-hadrosaurid hadrosauroid, albeit as the sister group to Protohadros. Although Head had specifically redefined the Hadrosauridae, based on shared <b>characteristics,</b> <b>to</b> include Protohadros, Horner and colleagues adapted a taxon-based definition that excluded Protohadros and thus Eolambia. They also identified additional characteristics differentiating Eolambia from hadrosaurids: there are coarse denticles on the teeth of the dentary, and the coronoid process is weakly expanded.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} the Tornado to perform well as a {{low-level}} supersonic strike aircraft, it was considered necessary for it to possess good high-speed and low-speed flight <b>characteristics.</b> <b>To</b> achieve high-speed performance, a swept or delta wing is typically adopted, but these wing designs are inefficient at low speeds. To operate at both high and low speeds with great effectiveness, the Tornado uses a variable-sweep wing. This approach had been adopted by earlier aircraft, such as the American General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark strike fighter, and the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 fighter. The F-111 has many similarities with the smaller Tornado; however, the Tornado differs in being a multi-role aircraft with more advanced onboard systems and avionics.|$|E
5|$|Personal {{interaction}} with the gods took many forms. People who wanted information or advice consulted oracles, run by temples, {{that were supposed to}} convey gods' answers to questions. Amulets and other images of protective deities were used to ward off the demons that might threaten human well-being or to impart the god's positive <b>characteristics</b> <b>to</b> the wearer. Private rituals invoked the gods' power to accomplish personal goals, from healing sickness to cursing enemies. These practices used heka, the same force of magic that the gods used, which the creator was said to have given to humans so they could fend off misfortune. The performer of a private rite often took on the role of a god in a myth, or even threatened a deity, to involve the gods in accomplishing the goal. Such rituals coexisted with private offerings and prayers, and all three were accepted means of obtaining divine help.|$|E
