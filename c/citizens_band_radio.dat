The police focused instead on allegations of infidelity; in late August the police stated that Udin had been murdered by a jealous husband as a result of an extramarital affair with a woman named Tri Sumaryani, a <b>Citizens</b> <b>Band</b> <b>radio</b> enthusiast who had once dated Udin's younger brother. However, Sumaryani soon admitted to the press that she had been paid to fabricate this testimony by a nephew of Sri Roso.|$|E
500|$|In January 1972, Popular Electronics {{changed its}} {{editorial}} focus {{in an attempt}} to attract more advertising revenues. Reviews of stereo equipment and <b>citizens</b> <b>band</b> <b>radio</b> were featured; experimenter and constructions projects were gone. Dan Meyer, Don Lancaster, Forrest Mims, John Simonton and many other authors immediately started contributing to the competing Radio-Electronics magazine. The June 1972 cover story was [...] "Experimenting with a $32 Solid State Laser" [...] by Forrest Mims. Another article in that issue was [...] "Experiments with Op-Amps" [...] by B.R. Rogen; this was a pseudonym of Popular Electronics technical editor, Les Solomon. Solomon wrote articles for Radio-Electronics while working for Popular Electronics. Lou Garner, the longtime solid-state editor, moved to Radio-Electronics for a year. Several MITS kit projects were featured in Radio-Electronics including the ITC 1800 Integrated Circuit Tester (May 1972), the Model 1700 Function Generator (July 1973), the Model 1440 Calculator (July 1973) and the 88 VLCT Computer Terminal (November 1974).|$|E
