A total of 216 osteosarcoma patients {{were enrolled in the}} study. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses between the groups were performed and Kaplan–Meier analysis was conducted to plot the survival curves. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated and areas under the curve (AUCs) were compared to assess the discriminatory ability of the inflammation-based indicators, including CRP/Alb ratio, Glasgow prognostic score (GPS), neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet–lymphocyte ratio (PLR). The optimal cutoff value was 0. 210 for CRP/Alb ratio with a Youden index of 0. 319. Higher values of CRP/Alb ratio were significantly associated with poorer overall survival in univariate (HR = 2. 62, 95 % CI = 1. 70 – 4. 03; P< 0. 001) and multivariate (HR = 2. 21, 95 % CI = 1. 40 – 3. 49; P= 0. 001) analyses. In addition, the CRP/Alb ratio had significantly higher AUC values compared with GPS (P= 0. 003), NLR (P< 0. 001), and PLR (P< 0. 001). The study demonstrated that the CRP/Alb ratio is an effective inflammation-based prognostic indicator in osteosarcoma, which potentially has a discriminatory ability superior to that of other inflammatory indicators including GPS, NLR, and PLR.

40|$|Abstract Background Cachexia is a {{state of}} {{involuntary}} weight loss common to many chronic diseases. Experimental data, showing that cachexia is related to the enhancement of acute phase response reaction, led to the new definition of cachexia that included, aside from the principal criterion of weight loss, other “minor criteria”, Amongst them are levels of C-reactive protein (<b>CRP),</b> <b>albumin</b> and hemoglobin. However, there is paucity of data regarding possible differences of these laboratory parameters in patients with various diseases known to be related to cachexia. Methods <b>CRP,</b> <b>albumin</b> and hemoglobin were evaluated in 119 patients, divided into two disease groups, hematological (ones with diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma or Hodgkin disease) and non-hematological (solid tumor patients and patients with chronic heart failure). Patients were further subdivided into two nutritional groups, cachectic and non-cachectic ones according to the principal criterion for cacxehia i. e. loss of body weight. Results We found that cachectic patients had higher levels of CRP, and lower levels of both hemoglobin and albumin compared to non-cachectic patients, regardless of the disease group they fitted. On the other hand, the group of hematological patients had lower levels of CRP primarily due to the differences found in the non-cachectic group. Higher levels of albumin were also found in the hematological group regardless of the nutritional group they fitted. Limitations of cut-off values, proposed by definition, were found, mostly regarding their relatively low sensitivity and low negative predictive value. Conclusions As expected, differences in values of routine laboratory parameters used in definition of cachexia were found between cachectic and non-cachectic patients. Their values differed between hematological and non-hematological patients both in cachectic and non-cachectic group. Cut-off levels currently used in definition of cachexia have limitations and should be further evaluated. </p...|$|R

40|$|Auranofin, {{a member}} of a class of {{compounds}} with disease modifying activity, was given to arthritic rats to determine if it could reverse the abnormal plasma concentrations of fibronectin (Fn), C reactive protein (<b>CRP),</b> and <b>albumin,</b> which were unaffected by treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). When auranofin was orally administered for two weeks to adjuvant induced arthritic rats it significantly inhibited swelling of the injected and non-injected paws at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg. Rocket electroimmunoassay measurement of plasma proteins in normal, arthritic, and auranofin treated arthritic rats indicated that auranofin at 10 mg/kg significantly decreased (by 77 %) the abnormally high concentration of arthritic rat plasma Fn, though it had no effect on Fn concentrations when administered to normal rats. CRP, which was raised approximately twofold above normal in arthritic rats, was reduced by 56 % after treatment of arthritic rats with auranofin at 10 mg/kg, though CRP concentrations in normal rats were unaffected by auranofin treatment. Depressed albumin concentrations in arthritic rats were significantly enhanced (by 30 %) by dosing with 10 mg/kg of auranofin. At the 3 mg/kg dose, auranofin did not significantly change plasma concentrations of Fn, <b>CRP,</b> and <b>albumin</b> in arthritic rats. At a dose of 10 mg/kg, however, auranofin, in addition to inhibiting chronic systemic paw inflammation, also altered abnormal concentrations of plasma Fn, <b>CRP,</b> and <b>albumin</b> in the adjuvant arthritic rat, thus distinguishing auranofin from standard NSAIDs we have previously tested...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Alterations in blood–brain barrier {{permeability}} {{have been}} proposed to represent a relevant factor contributing to Parkinson’s disease progression. However, few studies have addressed this issue in patients {{at different stages of}} disease. Methods Albumin was measured in cerebrospinal fluid and serum samples obtained from 73 non-demented subjects with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease and 47 age-matched control subjects. The <b>albumin</b> <b>ratio</b> (AR) was calculated to assess blood-cerebrospinal fluid and blood–brain barrier function. The group of patients with Parkinson’s disease included 46 subjects with Hoehn-Yahr staging between 1 and 2 and 27, with a score ranging from 2. 5 to 4. Results Statistically significant differences in <b>albumin</b> <b>ratio</b> were found between patients with advanced disease, and both early-stage and unaffected groups. Conversely, early-phase patients did not differ from healthy subjects. Additionally, dopaminergic treatment seems to exert a possible effect on AR values. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that possible dysfunction of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, blood–brain barrier, or both, characterize Parkinson’s disease progression. The associations between clinical scores, treatments and biochemical findings suggest a progressive impairment of barrier integrity {{during the course of the}} disease. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{water-soluble}} chitosan, a natural polymer derived from chitin, on indices of oxidative stress {{was investigated in}} normal volunteers. Treatment with chitosan for 4 weeks produced {{a significant decrease in}} levels of plasma glucose, atherogenic index and led to increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL). Chitosan treatment also lowered the ratio of oxidized to reduced albumin and increased total plasma antioxidant activity (TPA). There was good correlation between TPA and oxidized <b>albumin</b> <b>ratio.</b> The results indicate that oxidized <b>albumin</b> <b>ratio</b> represents a potentially useful marker of oxidative stress. In in vitro studies, albumin carbonyls and hydroperoxides were significantly decreased in a time-dependent manner in the presence of chitosan, compared with controls (p < 0. 05). Chitosan also reduced two stable radicals in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The results suggest that chitosan has a direct antioxidant activity in systemic circulation by lowering the indices of oxidative stress in both in vitro and in vivo studies. This may confer benefits additional to the reduction in plasma carbohydrate and increase in HDL levels. It may also inhibit oxidation of serum albumin commonly observed in patients undergoing hemodialysis, resulting in reduction of oxidative stress associated with uremia. 6 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{inflammation}} is {{the cause}} of malnutrition and cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis patients. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess C Reactive Protein (CRP) as an inflammatory marker and to define the relationship between CRP and other inflammatory and nutritional factors in this group of patients. One hundred and fourteen hemodialysis patients undergoing chronic dialysis (3 times a week for at least 4 hours) in two hemodialysis centers were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Anthropometric and laboratory data including CRP, Il- 6, hemoglobin, serum ferritin, triglyceride, cholesterol, albumin, total protein and transferrin were measured. The Kt/V for adequacy of dialysis was also calculated. There was a statistically signi-ficant correlation between the mean <b>CRP</b> and <b>albumin,</b> hemoglobin, and transferrin; while such relation was not found with BMI, ferritin, the length of dialysis, triceps skin fold thickness, mid arm circumference, mid arm muscle circumference, and Kt/V. We conclude that the negative relationship between <b>CRP</b> and <b>albumin,</b> transferrin, and hemoglobin suggests a correlation bet-ween inflammatory and nutritional factors...|$|R

40|$|Background Estimation of the {{prognosis}} of resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) currently relies on tumour-related factors such as resection margins and on lymph-node ratio (LNR) both inconveniently available only postoperatively. Our aim {{was to assess the}} accuracy of preoperative laboratory data in predicting PDAC prognosis. Methods Collection of laboratory and clinical data was retrospective from 265 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for PDAC at Helsinki University Hospital. Cancer-specific survival assessment utilized Kaplan-Meier analysis, and independent associations between factors were by the Cox regression model. Results During follow-up, 76 % of the patients died of PDAC, with a median survival time of 19. 6 months. In univariate analysis, <b>CRP,</b> <b>albumin,</b> CEA, and CA 19 - 9 were significantly associated with postoperative cancer-specific survival. In multivariate analysis, taking into account age, gender, LNR, resection margins, tumour status, and adjuvant chemotherapy, the preoperative biomarkers independently associated with adverse prognosis were hypoalbuminemia (5 mg/L, HR 1. 44, 95 % CI 1. 03 - 2. 02, p = 0. 036), CEA (> 5 mu g/L, HR 1. 60, 95 % CI 1. 07 - 2. 53, p = 0. 047), and CA 19 - 9 (>= 555 kU/L, HR 1. 91, 95 % CI 1. 18 - 3. 08, p = 0. 008).

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{quantify}} {{the magnitude of the}} systemic inflammatory response, measured by C-reactive protein (<b>CRP)</b> and <b>albumin,</b> and its relationship with common serum biochemical measures of iron status including total iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation, and ferritin. Retrospective interrogation of laboratory computer databases at 4 centers between 2006 and 2011 provided results from patients in which serum <b>CRP</b> and <b>albumin</b> had been measured together with iron studies (iron, transferrin, and transferrin saturation, n = 16, 522) and ferritin (n = 7, 226). Analyte results were categorized into groups according to <b>CRP</b> and <b>albumin.</b> When those groups with CRP 35 g/L, CRP 11 – 80 mg/L and albumin 25 - 35 mg/L, and CRP > 80 mg/L and albumin < 25 g/L were compared, the median serum total iron was 15. 0, 7. 0, and 3. 0 μmol/L, respectively (P < 0. 001), an overall reduction of 80 %. The median serum transferrin concentration was 2. 6, 2. 0, and 1. 3 μmol/L respectively (P < 0. 001), an overall reduction of 50 %. The median transferrin saturation was 23 %, 13 %, and 10 % respectively (P < 0. 001), an overall reduction of 56 %. The median serum ferritin was 77, 173, and 445 μg/L respectively (P < 0. 001), an overall increase of 578 %. The present study quantifies the impact of the systemic inflammatory response on serum measures of iron status.

40|$|Poor sleep {{quality is}} a common problem that can {{potentially}} predict mortality risk {{and quality of life}} in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Also, inflammation {{is a common}} feature in HD patients. To determine sleep quality and its correlation with serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level in these patients, we studied 132 chronic HD patients in two university-affiliated teaching hospitals in Sari, Iran during September 2010. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was employed to assess the sleep quality of the patients in addition to <b>CRP,</b> <b>albumin,</b> cholesterol, phosphorus and hemoglobin levels. There were 104 (78. 7 %) patients who suffered from poor sleep quality. A significant correlation was found between serum CRP level and the patients′ sleep quality (P < 0. 05). There was also a significant correlation between sleep quality and serum phosphorus and albumin levels and body mass index (P < 0. 05). Furthermore, a significant positive correlation existed between the different components of sleep quality and CRP (P < 0. 05). We conclude that there is a correlation between decreased sleep quality in HD patients and elevated CRP levels, which may have therapeutic implications...|$|R
