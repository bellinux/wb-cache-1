40|$|The article {{investigates the}} {{characteristics}} {{and forms of}} <b>cooperation</b> <b>between</b> criminal investigation officers* and forensic laboratory specialists in pre-trial proceedings, as well as practical problems in such cooperation. Recently {{there have been a}} number of particularly heated debates about the relationship between determining a person possessing special knowledge and his/her status in pre-trial proceedings. Other discussed aspects include <b>cooperation</b> <b>between</b> entities involved in pre-trial proceedings in international contexts. A less intensive (albeit equally important) discussion relates to the form and characteristics of <b>cooperation</b> <b>between</b> criminal investigation officers on the one hand and specialists and experts on the other in investigating criminal acts. Bearing in mind the high practical importance and the existing differences in scholarly approaches to these issues, the current study concentrates on the forms and content of <b>cooperation</b> <b>between</b> law <b>enforcement</b> officers and specialists (experts) from forensic laboratories, as well as on problems resulting from such cooperation and directions for improvement. The first part of the article presents selected views on the definition of a person possessing special knowledge currently used in Lithuania** and in a number of other states. In the authors’ opinion, unification (harmonization) of various notions (definitions), terms and statuses of an expert, a specialist and special knowledge should be one of the objectives in implementing the vision of the joint European forensic science area 2020. Achieving this objective requires a comprehensive analysis of standards in law and management in using special knowledge of each state***. The second part, supported by empirical study results, discusses practical problems of <b>cooperation</b> <b>between</b> a law <b>enforcement</b> officer and a specialist (expert), analyzes three basic forms of their cooperation and presents the content of those forms: activities at the crime scene, cooperation of the two entities in commissioning tests, preparing test materials and actual performance of such tests, and finally participation of a specialist in other pre-trial activities.

Therefore, police could not do their job by themselves without any support and information from the parent or society to against the act circulation of narcotics and narcotics addiction, children as narcotics addict are the victim of the act circulation of narcotics itself, and jail is not the right place to give them punishment, why, because all of they had done was such kind of disease and disorder which is created by bad relationship, so that it must be cured from their addiction by getting rehabilitation. Parents have an important role in making their children learning about environment and controlling their children from negative relationship. By seeing the data from narcotics victim abuse in Indonesia in years, it was so apprehensive. In fact, most victims are come from school ageing. But, there is no valid data. In East Java, Malang city is placed the second city after Surabaya related with the luster of act circulation and narcotics abuse. In Polresta Malang there is data of total of everyone addict under the age in 2006 are 22 people, 16 people of it are law processed caused by their parents doesn’t send them in rehabilitation place or police office, while 6 people that reported by their parents are under controlling of Polresta Malang rehabilitation place until they totally free from their addicted. In section 86 (2) states that: “someone addicts under the age and have been reported by their parents as means on section 46 (1) are not prosecuted in court”. Section 86 (2) means that for the parents of someone addicts under the age that have been reported their children’s act are not prosecuted in court based on many consideration that their act are implicate good intention as a form of their participation in social life. From the result and discussion of this research the writer conclude that many kinds of <b>cooperation</b> <b>between</b> law <b>enforcement</b> apparatus (police) in Polresta Malang and parents in solving and deleting the addiction of narcotics addicts under the age are the preventive and repressive form of cooperation, after that the performance of <b>cooperation</b> <b>between</b> law <b>enforcement</b> apparatus (police) in Polresta Malang and parents in solving and deleting the addiction of narcotics addicts under the age are going effectively, but there is some problems that faced by them in solving and deleting that addictions, they are: a) the less of control by the parents itself or there is no harmonious relationship by the parents that make their children become addict under the age, b) most of police apparatus that still oriented with the successful of arrest narcotics addicts. ...|$|R

In El Salvador, the role traditionally played by police has been that of the repressor of crime, with no concern for community outreach. However, {{over the last two}} years, the law enforcement agency has had an about face in terms of its attention to the problem of violence and crime. As a result, it has introduced the community police philosophy. That is, a law enforcement agency that empowers active participation in the community in identifying and preventing problems that affect it, meaning that community participation is promoted in terms of tasks tied to citizen security. Currently, what is under consideration {{is the degree to which}} there is a process of strengthening the bonds of solidarity, constructive relationships between neighbors, and the existence of social capital that contributes to <b>cooperation</b> <b>between</b> law <b>enforcement</b> and community in preventing violence and crime.

Within India, this species has received protection as a Schedule IV list species of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 for over 40 years. This study documents the illegal trade of 55, 000 individuals poached from just one 'trade hub' in India. Although domestic demand persists, these individuals {{appear to have been}} primarily sourced to satiate international demand for pets in other Asian countries (e. g. Thailand and China). Since 1975, this species has been included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) that regulates all commercial trade. However, an analysis of the CITES trade records relating to Thailand imports (between 2004 and 2013) found large discrepancies indicating potential illegal activity which question the legitimacy of its founding captive stock. Given its role as a major hub of illegal trade activity, both as a consumer and a country of transit, we support calls for Thailand to prohibit private ownership by extending its domestic legislation to also cover non-indigenous tortoise species. In consideration of conservation and animal welfare concerns, we also call for more field research to determine the impacts of illegal trade on wild populations, an updated assessment of its conservation status, increased <b>cooperation</b> <b>between</b> national <b>enforcement</b> agencies, and the implementation of targeted human behaviour change initiatives to help reduce consumer demand for this species...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Worldwide, {{people who}} use drugs (PWUD) are among the populations at highest risk for HIV infection. In China, PWUD are {{primarily}} sentenced to compulsory detainment centres, in which access to healthcare, including HIV treatment and prevention services, is limited or non-existent. In 2008, China's 2008 Anti-Drug Law encouraged the {{development and use of}} community-based drug dependence rehabilitation, yet there is limited evidence evaluating the efficacy and challenges of this model in China. In this study, we explore these challenges and describe how <b>cooperation</b> <b>between</b> law <b>enforcement</b> and health departments can meet the needs of PWUD. Methods: In 2015, we conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews with all four staff members and 16 clients of the Ping An Centre No. 1 for community-based drug treatment, three local police officers and three officials from the local Centre for Disease Control. Interviews explored obstacles in implementing community-based drug dependence treatment and efforts to resolve these difficulties. Transcripts were coded and analyzed with qualitative data analysis software (MAXQDA 11). Results: We identified three challenges to community-based drug treatment at the Ping An Centre No. 1 : (1) suboptimal coordination among parties involved, (2) a divergence in attitudes towards PWUD and harm reduction <b>between</b> law <b>enforcement</b> and health officials and (3) conflicting performance targets for police and health officials that undermine the shared goal of treatment. We also identified the take-home methadone maintenance treatment model at the Ping An Centre No. 1 as an example of an early successful collaboration between the police, the health department and PWUD. Conclusions: To overcome barriers to effective community-based drug treatment, we recommend aligning the goals of law enforcement and public health agencies towards health-based performance indicators. Furthermore, tensions between PWUD and police need to be addressed and trust between them fostered, using community-based treatment centres as mediators. The preliminary success of the take-home methadone maintenance treatment pilot can serve {{as an example of how}} collaboration with the police and other government agencies can meet the needs of PWUD and contribute to the success of community-based treatment...|$|R
