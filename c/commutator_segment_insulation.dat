50|$|The {{introduction}} of the carbon brush had convenient side effects. Carbon brushes tend to wear more evenly than copper brushes, and the soft carbon causes far less damage to the <b>commutator</b> <b>segments.</b> There is less sparking with carbon as compared to copper, and as the carbon wears away, the higher resistance of carbon results in fewer problems from the dust collecting on the <b>commutator</b> <b>segments.</b>|$|R
50|$|Early {{machines}} used brushes {{made from}} strands of copper wire {{to contact the}} surface of the commutator. However, these hard metal brushes tended to scratch and groove the smooth <b>commutator</b> <b>segments,</b> eventually requiring resurfacing of the commutator. As the copper brushes wore away, the dust and pieces of the brush could wedge between <b>commutator</b> <b>segments,</b> shorting them and reducing the efficiency of the device. Fine copper wire mesh or gauze provided better surface contact with less segment wear, but gauze brushes were more expensive than strip or wire copper brushes.|$|R
5000|$|Practical commutators have {{at least}} three contact segments, to prevent a [...] "dead" [...] spot where two brushes {{simultaneously}} bridge only two <b>commutator</b> <b>segments.</b> Brushes are made wider than the insulated gap, to ensure that brushes are always in contact with an armature coil. For commutators with at least three segments, although the rotor can potentially stop {{in a position where}} two <b>commutator</b> <b>segments</b> touch one brush, this only de-energizes one of the rotor arms while the others will still function correctly. With the remaining rotor arms, a motor can produce sufficient torque to begin spinning the rotor, and a generator can provide useful power to an external circuit.|$|R
50|$|<b>Commutator</b> <b>segments</b> are {{connected}} to the coils of the armature, with the number of coils (and <b>commutator</b> <b>segments)</b> depending on the speed and voltage of the machine. Large motors may have hundreds of segments.Each conducting <b>segment</b> of the <b>commutator</b> is insulated from adjacent segments. Mica was used on early machines and is still used on large machines. Many other insulating materials are used to insulate smaller machines; plastics allow quick manufacture of an insulator, for example. The segments are held onto the shaft using a dovetail shape on the edges or underside of each segment. Insulating wedges around the perimeter of each segment are pressed so that the commutator maintains its mechanical stability throughout its normal operating range.|$|R
50|$|The high {{resistance}} or {{carbon brush}} is made large {{enough that it}} is significantly wider than the insulating segment that it spans (and on large machines may often span two insulating segments). The result {{of this is that}} as the <b>commutator</b> <b>segment</b> passes from under the brush, the current passing to it ramps down more smoothly than had been the case with pure copper brushes where the contact broke suddenly. Similarly the segment coming into contact with the brush has a similar ramping up of the current. Thus, although the current passing through the brush was more or less constant, the instantaneous current passing to the two <b>commutator</b> <b>segments</b> was proportional to the relative area in contact with the brush.|$|R
50|$|In the {{coils of}} the rotor, {{even after the}} brush has been reached, {{currents}} tend to continue to flow for a brief moment, resulting in a wasted energy as heat due to the brush spanning across several <b>commutator</b> <b>segments</b> and the current short-circuiting across the segments.|$|R
50|$|For {{certain types}} of {{electric}} motors or generators to function, the coils of the rotor must be connected to complete an electrical circuit. To accomplish this, a copper or brass commutator or 'slip rings' are affixed to the shaft, and springs press braided copper wire 'brushes' onto the rings which conduct the current. Such brushes provided poor commutation as they moved from one <b>commutator</b> <b>segment</b> to the next. The cure was the introduction of 'high resistance brushes' made from graphite (sometimes with added copper). Although the resistance was {{of the order of}} tens of milliohms, they were high resistance enough to provide a gradual shift of current from one <b>commutator</b> <b>segment</b> to the next. The term brush remains in use. Since the brushes wear out, they can be replaced in products intended to allow maintenance.|$|R
50|$|A {{completed}} Mabuchi motor {{consists of}} 23 separate parts: endbell; shaft support; spacer; bearing; brush holder; terminal; damper; brush; oil stopper; varistor; <b>commutator</b> <b>segment</b> retainer; <b>commutator</b> segment; commutator core; insulating lamination; laminated core; magnet wire; more insulating lamination; shaft; rotor brush; another oil stopper; magnet; bearing; and, finally, the motor housing itself.|$|R
50|$|One variety, {{notable for}} having an {{adjustable}} speed, runs continuously with brushes in contact, while another uses repulsion only for high starting torque {{and in some}} cases lifts the brushes once the motor is running fast enough. In the latter case, all <b>commutator</b> <b>segments</b> are connected together as well, before the motor attains running speed.|$|R
5000|$|The brushes of a {{generator}} must {{be set in}} the neutral plane; that is, they must contact <b>segments</b> of the <b>commutator</b> that are connected to armature coils having no induced emf. If the brushes were contacting <b>commutator</b> <b>segments</b> outside the neutral plane, they would short-circuit [...] "live" [...] coils and cause arcing and loss of power.|$|R
5000|$|Due to friction, the {{brushes and}} copper <b>commutator</b> <b>segments</b> wear out. In small {{consumer}} {{products such as}} power tools and appliances the brushes may {{last as long as}} the product, but larger machines require regular replacement of brushes and occasional resurfacing of the commutator. So commutated machines are not used in equipment at remote locations that must operate for long periods without maintenance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{contact point}} where a brush touches the {{commutator}} {{is referred to}} as the commutating plane. To conduct sufficient current to or from the commutator, the brush contact area is not a thin line but instead a rectangular patch across the segments. Typically the brush is wide enough to span 2.5 <b>commutator</b> <b>segments.</b> This means that two adjacent segments are electrically connected by the brush when it contacts both.|$|R
40|$|This paper treats of the {{solution}} of the commutation equation ， i. e. differential epuati on concerning the current in a coil short-circuited by the brush ， {{in the case of the}} Tandem Brvsh. By this solution ， commutation curves and the values of the voltage drop between brush and <b>commutator</b> <b>segment</b> are obtained for some representative conditions of commu-tation in d-c machine to examine the commutating performance of the Tandem Brush. 1...|$|R
50|$|Two {{types of}} noise afflict {{magnetic}} guitar pickups. Hum {{is caused by}} magnetic fields due to power frequency currents in electrical equipment, whereas buzz is propagated as radio transmissions and sounds more like static. The sources of buzz are many, but one example is an AC power tool with a brush motor. The Brush (electric) makes and breaks electrical contact with the <b>commutator</b> <b>segment</b> several thousand times a second at variable frequency dependent on load thus causing radio frequency noise.|$|R
50|$|The {{different}} brush types {{make contact}} with the commutator in different ways. Because copper brushes have the same hardness as the <b>commutator</b> <b>segments,</b> the rotor cannot be spun backwards against the ends of copper brushes without the copper digging into the segments and causing severe damage. Consequently, strip/laminate copper brushes only make tangential contact with the commutator, while copper mesh and wire brushes use an inclined contact angle touching their edge across the <b>segments</b> of a <b>commutator</b> that can spin in only one direction.|$|R
5000|$|A {{commutator}} is {{a moving}} {{part of a}} rotary electrical switch in certain types of electric motors and electrical generators that periodically reverses the current direction between the rotor and the external circuit. It consists of a cylinder composed of multiple metal contact segments on the rotating armature of the machine. Two or more electrical contacts called [...] "brushes" [...] made of a soft conductive material like carbon press against the commutator, making sliding contact with successive <b>segments</b> of the <b>commutator</b> as it rotates. The windings (coils of wire) on the armature {{are connected to the}} <b>commutator</b> <b>segments.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some {{other names}} used for slip ring are {{collector}} ring, rotary electrical contact and electrical slip ring. Some people {{also use the}} term commutator; however, commutators are somewhat different and are specialized for use on DC motors and generators. While <b>commutators</b> are <b>segmented,</b> slip rings are continuous, and the terms are not interchangeable. Rotary transformers are often used instead of slip rings in high-speed or low-friction environments.|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} measuring system for arc duration time of commutation spark, which is fabricated {{to evaluate a}} commutation action of D-C machine quantitavely. The superior features of the developed system are as follows 1) It is enables measuring of the duration time of commutation spark all of the <b>commutator</b> <b>segment.</b> 2) Accuracy {{of the system is}} within 0. 1 μs. with 0. 5 ms. commutator period (maximum rotation number). 3) It makes possible the long time automatic measurement. We have measured the duration time of commutation arc to JEC- 54 commutation spark number. Findings are: 1) The ratio of frequency distribution has two peaks to the duration time of commutation arc. 2) The maximum point of arc duration time in the ratio of frequency distribution increases according to the commutation spark number. 3) Arc duration time depends on brush materials and revoling speed with the same commutation spark number which is measured with eye. It suggests that evaluation of commutation spark with eye measurement is inaccurate. Hence, quantitave measurement is necessary...|$|R
50|$|The winding {{specifications}} affect motor performance the most. Changing {{the number}} of turns per slot or the diameter of magnet wire produces results that differ greatly from each other. Environmental temperature affects the magnetic forces of magnets and the winding resistance, and so indicates changes in motor performance. Changing anisotropic magnets from wet to dry results in decreasing stall torques and increasing no-load speed due to the magnetic force being weakened. Magnets are held in a housing for their full capability, while using a thin-wall housing will result in magnetic force leaking through the housing wall. That is where magnet yokes are used to prevent magnetic leakage, thus maintaining the full capacity of the magnets. Phase refers to positional relations between the center line of each polar magnet and the switching position of <b>commutator</b> <b>segments</b> and brushes. Lagging in phase causes inefficiency, electrical noise, and shortened life. To avoid these situations, improved motors are assembled with forward brush-shifting that offsets the armature reaction during load operation to keep them on neutral electrically.|$|R
25|$|The {{first stage}} {{was to have}} been a more {{powerful}} and reusable solid fuel rocket derived from the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB). Compared with the Solid Rocket Booster, which had four segments, the most notable difference was the addition of a fifth segment. This fifth segment would have enabled the Ares I to produce more thrust. Other changes made to the Solid Rocket Booster were to have been the removal of the Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) attachment points and the replacement of the Solid Rocket Booster nosecone with a new forward adapter that would have interfaced with the liquid-fueled second stage. The adapter {{was to have been}} equipped with solid-fueled separation motors to facilitate the disconnection of the stages during ascent. The grain design was also changed, and so were the insulation and liner. By the Ares I first stage ground test, the case, grain design, number of <b>segments,</b> <b>insulation,</b> liner, throat diameter, thermal protection systems and nozzle had all changed.|$|R
50|$|One simple {{solution}} is to put {{a gap between the}} commutator plates which is wider than the ends of the brushes. This increases the zero-torque range of angular positions but eliminates the shorting problem; if the motor is started spinning by an outside force it will continue spinning. With this modification, it can also be effectively turned off simply by stalling (stopping) it in a position in the zero-torque (i.e. commutator non-contacting) angle range. This design is sometimes seen in homebuilt hobby motors, e.g. for science fairs and such designs can be found in some published science project books. A clear downside of this {{simple solution}} is that the motor now coasts through a substantial arc of rotation twice per revolution and the torque is pulsed. This may work for electric fans or to keep a flywheel spinning but there are many applications, even where starting and stopping are not necessary, for which it is completely inadequate, such as driving the capstan of a tape transport, or any instance where to speed up and slow down often and quickly is a requirement. Another disadvantage is that, since the coils have a measure of self inductance, current flowing in them cannot suddenly stop. The current attempts to jump the opening gap between the <b>commutator</b> <b>segment</b> and the brush, causing arcing.|$|R
25|$|Around 1832, Hippolyte Pixii {{improved}} the magneto {{by using a}} wire wound horseshoe, with the extra coils of conductor generating more current, but it was AC. André-Marie Ampère suggested a means of converting current from Pixii's magneto to DC using a rocking switch. Later <b>segmented</b> <b>commutators</b> were used to produce direct current.|$|R
50|$|Even {{for fans}} and flywheels, the clear {{weaknesses}} remaining in this design—especially {{that it is}} not self-starting from all positions—make it impractical for working use, especially considering the better alternatives that exist. Unlike the demonstration motor above, DC motors are commonly designed with more than two poles, are able to start from any position, and do not have any position where current can flow without producing electromotive power by passing through some coil. Many common small brushed DC motors used in toys and small consumer appliances, the simplest mass-produced DC motors to be found, have three-pole armatures. The brushes can now bridge two adjacent <b>commutator</b> <b>segments</b> without causing a short circuit. These three-pole armatures also have the advantage that current from the brushes either flows through two coils in series or through just one coil. Starting with the current in an individual coil at half its nominal value (as a result of flowing through two coils in series), it rises to its nominal value and then falls to half this value. The sequence then continues with current in the reverse direction. This results in a closer step-wise approximation to the ideal sinusoidal coil current, producing a more even torque than the two-pole motor where the current in each coil is closer to a square wave. Since current changes are half those of a comparable two-pole motor, arcing at the brushes is consequently less.|$|R
50|$|Flexible {{plate is}} used in {{electric}} motor and generator armatures, field coil insulation, and magnet and commutator core insulation. Mica consumption in flexible plate was about 21 tonnes in 2008 in the US. Heater plate is used where high-temperature insulation is required. Molding plate is sheet mica from which V-rings are cut and stamped for use in insulating the copper segments from the steel shaft ends of a commutator. Molding plate is also fabricated into tubes and rings for insulation in armatures, motor starters, and transformers. Segment plate acts as insulation between the copper <b>commutator</b> <b>segments</b> of direct-current universal motors and generators. Phlogopite built-up mica is preferred because it wears {{at the same rate}} as the copper segments. Although muscovite has a greater resistance to wear, it causes uneven ridges that may interfere with the operation of a motor or generator. Consumption of segment plate was about 149 t in 2008 in the US. Some types of built-up mica have the bonded splittings reinforced with cloth, glass, linen, muslin, plastic, silk, or special paper. These products are very flexible and are produced in wide, continuous sheets that are either shipped, rolled, or cut into ribbons or tapes, or trimmed to specified dimensions. Built-up mica products may also be corrugated or reinforced by multiple layering. In 2008, about 351 t of built-up mica was consumed in the US, mostly for molding plates (19%) and segment plates (42%).|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{requested}} by Manufacturing Engineering {{to determine what}} effects marking with nylon (6 / 6) and Teflon scribes may have on subsequent bonding. Witness panel bond specimens were fabricated by the development lab to test both acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) to Chemlok and NBR to NBR after controlled exposure. The nylon rod used as a scribe tool demonstrates virtually no bond deterioration when used to scribe lines on either the Chemlok to NBR surfaces or the NBR to NBR interface. Lab test {{results indicate that the}} nylon rod-exposed samples produce tensile and peel values very similar to the control samples and the Teflon exposed samples produce tensile and peel values much lower than the control samples. Visual observation of the failure surfaces of the tested samples shows that Teflon scribing produces an obvious contamination to the surface and the nylon produces no effect. Photographs of test samples are provided. It is concluded that Teflon stock used as a scribe tool on a Chemlok 233 to NBR surface or an NBR to NBR surface has a detrimental effect on the bond integrity on either of these bond interfaces. Therefore, it is recommended that the nylon rod continue to be used where a scribe line is required in the redesigned solid rocket motor <b>segment</b> <b>insulation</b> layup operations. The use of Teflon scribes should not be considered...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop a {{high-speed}} fault transducer and, based on it, to create an automated system for monitoring and repairing faulty insulation of winding wires in electrical equipment.

2500|$|Revertive pulsing is {{a method}} of {{signaling}} in which the terminating equipment sends pulses backwards to the originating equipment as it hunts for the appropriate terminal. This {{is in contrast to}} more modern forms of forward pulsing where the originating equipment will directly outpulse to the terminating side the information it needs to connect the call. In Panel offices, as the selectors were driven upwards by the motors, brushes attached to the vertical selector rods [...] wiped over commutators {{at the top of the}} frame. These <b>commutators</b> contained alternating <b>segments</b> which serve either as insulators or conductors. When the brush passed over a conductive segment, it was grounded, thereby generating a pulse which was sent back to the sender in the originating office for counting. When the sender counted the appropriate number of pulses, it cut the power to the solenoid in the terminating office, and caused the brush to stop at its current position.|$|R
40|$|In {{support of}} the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) is {{developing}} a new, more powerful solid rocket motor for space launch applications. To minimize technical risks and development costs, NASA chose to use the Space Shuttle s solid rocket boosters {{as a starting point}} in the design and development.

40|$|NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) {{continued}} to make significant progress in 2015 and 2016, completing hardware and testing that brings NASA closer to {{a new era of}} deep space exploration. Programmatically, SLS completed Critical Design Review (CDR) in 2015. A team of independent reviewers concluded that the vehicle design is technically and programmatically ready to move to Design Certification Review (DCR) and launch readiness in 2018. Just five years after program start, every major element has amassed development and flight hardware and completed key tests that will lead to an accelerated pace of manufacturing and testing in 2016 and 2017. Key to SLS' rapid progress has been the use of existing technologies adapted to the new launch vehicle. The existing fleet of RS- 25 engines is undergoing adaptation tests to prove it can meet SLS requirements and environments with minimal change. The four-segment shuttle-era booster has been modified and updated with a fifth propellant <b>segment,</b> new <b>insulation,</b> and new avionics. The Interim Cryogenic Upper Stage is a modified version of an existing upper stage. The first Block I SLS configuration will launch a minimum of 70 metric tons (t) of payload to low Earth orbit (LEO). The vehicle architecture has a clear evolutionary path to more than 100 t and, ultimately, to 130 t. Among the program's major 2015 - 2016 accomplishments were two booster qualification hotfire tests, a series of RS- 25 adaptation hotfire tests, manufacturing of most of the major components for both core stage test articles and first flight tank, delivery of the Pegasus core stage barge, and the upper stage simulator.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the nature}} and scale of transaction costs (TCs) borne by obliged parties under a "Tradable White Certificate" (TWC) scheme. Taking {{the first phase of}} the Energy Efficiency Commitment (EECl) in Great Britain as a case study, several sources of TCs were considered, such as search for information, persuasion of customers, negotiation with business partners, and measurement and verification activities. Information was obtained through interviews and a questionnaire distributed to obliged parties. Results show that the most significant sources of TCs were related to search for information, persuading customers and negotiating with managing agents/contractors to implement energy efficiency measures. Perceived high TCs related to contract negotiation and liability risks slightly reduced the low trading level. The scale of TCs was estimated to be around 10 % and 30 % of total investments costs for the lighting and <b>insulation</b> <b>segments,</b> respectively. The results indicate that, despite the presence and scale of TCs, the EECl scheme generated energy savings that yielded net societal benefits. Estimated financial benefits range from 0. 6 to 6 p/kWh for insulation and lighting savings, respectively. When avoided external costs due to electricity savings are included, estimated economic benefits range from 3 to 8 p/kWh. Several lessons from the EECl can be drawn for TWC schemes. Among others, it is found that informative policy instruments to raise awareness among end-users are critical if a TWC scheme is to deliver cost-effective energy savings. In all, {{the nature and}} scale of TCs under TWC schemes will differ because of a number of endogenous and exogenous determinants. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
