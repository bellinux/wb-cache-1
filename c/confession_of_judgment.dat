50|$|<b>Confession</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> is a {{legal term}} that refers to a type of {{contract}} (or a clause with such a provision) in which a party agrees to let the other party enter a judgment against him or her. Such contracts are highly controversial and may be invalidated {{as a violation of}} due process by courts, since the obligor is essentially contracting away his right to raise any legitimate defenses.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} values comumers place on {{restrictions}} of creditor remedies. The unique data employed {{were derived from}} a 1979 consumer survey taken across four local credit markets that differed significantly in their legal environments. The results of binomial logit analysis identified the characteristics of consumers {{who were willing to}} pay for contractual protection from several creditor remedies. A study of the dollar amounts that consumers were inclined to pay provided few significant results â€¢. One aspect of the legal environment for consumer credit is the restrictions placed on remedies that creditors may use to collect delin-quent and defaulted debts. A major change in this legal setting occurred on March 1, 1985 when, after ten years of rule making, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published its Credit Practice Rule. The regulation prohibits consumer credit contracts from including <b>confessions</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> waivers that exempt certain property from creditor's claims, the assignment of future wages, the non purchase money security interests in household goods. It also bans the pyramiding of late charges. This ruling affects finance companies, retailers, and federal credit unions.

In March 1800, Danforth {{returned}} to New York State to recruit labourers for renewed road building in the spring. Green's lawyer promptly had Danforth arrested and jailed for debt. In prison, he faced perpetual ruin and knew that unless he was released, he could not complete the road and would forfeit all further payments from the government of Upper Canada. Trapped, Danforth had to accept Green's harsh terms and signed a <b>confession</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> and a bond for $6,000 which was about twice what he believed he owed to Green.|$|E
50|$|Opposition to salary lenders was {{spearheaded by}} social elites, such as {{businessmen}} and charity organizations. Businessmen were encouraged not to fire employees who were indebted to loan sharks, as they unwittingly supported the industry by providing lenders with {{a means of}} blackmailing their customers ("pay up or we'll tell your boss and you'll be fired"). Charities provided legal support to troubled borrowers. This fight culminated in the drafting of the Uniform Small Loan Law, which brought into existence {{a new class of}} licensed lender. The law was enacted, first in several states in 1917, and was adopted by all but a handful of states {{by the middle of the}} 20th century. The model statute mandated consumer protections and capped the interest rate on loans of $300 or less at 3.5% a month (42% a year), a profitable level for small loans. Lenders had to give the customer copies of all signed documents. Additional charges such as late fees were banned. The lender could no longer receive power of attorney or <b>confession</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> over a customer. These licensing laws made it impossible for usurious lenders to pass themselves off as legal. Small loans also started becoming more socially acceptable, and banks and other larger institutions started offering them as well.|$|E

This research was qualitative research, in which content {{analysis was used to}} analyze speech act of complaint. The data of the research were in the forms of utterances as uttered by the characters in <b>Confessions</b> <b>of</b> a Shopaholic found in dialogues. In the research, quantitative data were also used in the form of number to strengthen the findings. The main instrument of the research was the researcher herself and the secondary instrument was the data sheets. The data were collected by note-taking technique. In analyzing the data, the researcher used referential methods. The methods were done by identifying and re-examining the data based on the theory of complaint strategies and the theory of complaint functions proposed by Anna Trosborg. The validity of the research was gained by doing the theory of triangulation and doing peer correction with competent friends of English Language and Literature majoring in linguistics. The research reveals three findings. First, {{the ways of}} expressing complaint applied by <b>Confessions</b> <b>of</b> a Shopaholicâ€™s characters are direct and indirect types. In the application <b>of</b> the type, <b>Confessions</b> <b>of</b> a Shopaholicâ€™s characters mostly apply indirect complaints compared to direct complaint. Second, the four complaint functions applied by characters <b>of</b> <b>Confession</b> <b>of</b> a Shopaholic are request to repair, threat, request for forbearance, and share negative evaluation. In the application <b>of</b> the maxims, <b>Confessions</b> <b>of</b> a Shopaholicâ€™s characters mostly apply request for repair, and they never use request for forbearance. Third, the complaint strategies applied by <b>Confessions</b> <b>of</b> a Shopaholicâ€™s characters are no explicit reproach, expressing of disapproval, accusation, and blame. Blame is applied mostly by <b>Confessions</b> <b>of</b> a Shopaholicâ€™s characters in their utterances. Key words: <b>Confessions</b> <b>of</b> a Shopaholic, speech acts of complain...|$|R
