Experiments were performed at different inlet H 2 S concentrations, air and/or liquid volumetric flow rates, and sulfate concentrations in the recirculating liquid to check their effect on the performance of the BTF. Conversion of H 2 S never dropped below 80 % at the highest concentration and reached 100 % at low concentrations. A maximum removal rate of 22. 5 g H 2 Sm− 3 reactor h− 1 was observed with 100 % removal efficiency. The shortest empty bed retention time studied at which complete H 2 S removal was observed was around 11 s.

50|$|Overall, protein skimmers can be classed in {{two ways}} {{depending}} on whether they operate by co-current flow or <b>counter-current</b> <b>flow.</b> In a co-current flow system, air is introduced {{at the bottom of}} the chamber and is in contact with the water as it rises upwards towards the collection chamber. In a counter-current system, air is forced into the system under pressure and moves against the flow of the water for a while before it rises up towards the collection cup. Because the air bubbles may be in contact with the water for a longer period in a <b>counter-current</b> <b>flow</b> system, protein skimmers of this type are considered by some to be more effective at removing organic wastes.|$|E

50|$|The {{principle}} of hemodialysis {{is the same}} as other methods of dialysis; it involves diffusion of solutes across a semipermeable membrane. Hemodialysis utilizes counter current flow, where the dialysate is flowing in the opposite direction to blood flow in the extracorporeal circuit. <b>Counter-current</b> <b>flow</b> maintains the concentration gradient across the membrane at a maximum and increases the efficiency of the dialysis.|$|E
50|$|In {{cold weather}} the {{blood flow to}} the limbs of birds and mammals is reduced on {{exposure}} to cold environmental conditions, and returned to the trunk via the deep veins which lie alongside the arteries (forming venae comitantes). This acts as a counter-current exchange system which short-circuits the warmth from the arterial blood directly into the venous blood returning into the trunk, causing minimal heat loss from the extremities in cold weather. The subcutaneous limb veins are tightly constricted, thereby reducing heat loss via this route, and forcing the blood returning from the extremities into the <b>counter-current</b> blood <b>flow</b> systems in the centers of the limbs. Birds and mammals that regularly immerse their limbs in cold or icy water have particularly well developed <b>counter-current</b> blood <b>flow</b> systems to their limbs, allowing prolonged exposure of the extremities to the cold without significant loss of body heat, even when the limbs are as thin as the lower legs, or tarsi, of a bird, for instance.|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} study, air bubble motion in <b>counter-current</b> water <b>flow</b> {{conditions}} in a vertical pipe is investigated experimentally. For this purpose, a test set-up {{was designed and}} constructed. Images of motions of single bubbles, having different diameters {{in the range of}} 3. 0 - 4. 8 mm, generated by specially designed bubble injectors were recorded by using a monochrome camera, an image capture card and a PC.

The hollow fiber membranes have been characterized for its morphology using field effect scanning electron microscope. In SMD process, a bunch of hollow fiber membranes are glued together at both ends to get a simplified open membrane module assembly submerged into the coolant tank equipped with a mechanical stirrer. Hot feed stream is allowed {{to pass through the}} lumen side of the membrane using a feed pump. Continuous stirring at the coolant side will reduce the temperature and concentration polarization. During the conventional DCMD process, using feed-coolant streams with co-current and <b>counter-current</b> <b>flows</b> has been tested and the results are compared in this study. In SMD process, a water vapor flux of 10. 2 kg m- 2 h- 1 is achieved when using a feed inlet temperature of 80 °C and coolant temperature of 20 °C. Under the same conditions, during conventional DCMD process, a water vapor flux of 11. 6 and 10. 1 kg m- 2 h- 1 were observed during <b>counter-current</b> and co-current <b>flow</b> streams, respectively. Results show that the water production in the SMD process is comparable with the conventional DCMD process, while the feed-coolant flow streams are in the co-current direction. During conventional DCMD operation, a 15 % increase in the water production is observed when feed-coolant streams are in the counter-current direction compared to the co-current direction. © 2014 © 2014 Balaban Desalination Publications.

50|$|The {{rotary dryer}} {{is a type}} of {{industrial}} dryer employed to reduce or minimize the liquid moisture content of the material it is handling by bringing it into direct contact with a heated gas. The dryer is made up of a large, rotating cylindrical tube, usually supported by concrete columns or steel beams. The dryer slopes slightly so that the discharge end is lower than the material feed end in order to convey the material through the dryer under gravity. Material to be dried enters the dryer, and as the dryer rotates, the material is lifted up by a series of internal fins lining the inner wall of the dryer. When the material gets high enough to roll back off the fins, it falls back {{down to the bottom of}} the dryer, passing through the hot gas stream as it falls. This gas stream can either be moving toward the discharge end from the feed end (known as co-current flow), or toward the feed end from the discharge end (known as <b>counter-current</b> <b>flow).</b> The gas stream can be made up of a mixture of air and combustion gases from a burner, in which case the dryer is called a direct heated dryer. Alternatively, the gas stream may consist of air or another (sometimes inert) gas that is preheated. When the gas stream is preheated by some means where burner combustion gases do not enter the dryer, the dryer known as an indirect-heated type. Often, indirect heated dryers are used when product contamination is a concern. In some cases, a combination of direct-indirect heated rotary dryers are also available to improve the overall efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Dialysis {{works on}} the {{principles}} of the diffusion of solutes and ultrafiltration of fluid across a semi-permeable membrane. Diffusion is a property of substances in water; substances in water tend to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Blood flows by one side of a semi-permeable membrane, and a dialysate, or special dialysis fluid, flows by the opposite side. A semipermeable membrane is a thin layer of material that contains holes of various sizes, or pores. Smaller solutes and fluid pass through the membrane, but the membrane blocks the passage of larger substances (for example, red blood cells, large proteins). This replicates the filtering process that takes place in the kidneys, when the blood enters the kidneys and the larger substances are separated from the smaller ones in the glomerulus.The two main types of dialysis, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, remove wastes and excess water from the blood in different ways. Hemodialysis removes wastes and water by circulating blood outside the body through an external filter, called a dialyzer, that contains a semipermeable membrane. The blood flows in one direction and the dialysate flows in the opposite. The <b>counter-current</b> <b>flow</b> of the blood and dialysate maximizes the concentration gradient of solutes between the blood and dialysate, which helps to remove more urea and creatinine from the blood. The concentrations of solutes (for example potassium, phosphorus, and urea) are undesirably high in the blood, but low or absent in the dialysis solution, and constant replacement of the dialysate ensures that the concentration of undesired solutes is kept low {{on this side of the}} membrane. The dialysis solution has levels of minerals like potassium and calcium that are similar to their natural concentration in healthy blood. For another solute, bicarbonate, dialysis solution level is set at a slightly higher level than in normal blood, to encourage diffusion of bicarbonate into the blood, to act as a pH buffer to neutralize the metabolic acidosis that is often present in these patients. The levels of the components of dialysate are typically prescribed by a nephrologist according to the needs of the individual patient.|$|E
