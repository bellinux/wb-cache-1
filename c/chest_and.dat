5|$|A {{man with}} a tattooed tree on his <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> back is {{introduced}} in the opening minutes of Carnivàles pilot episode, and appears in many other Avataric visions and dreams: in Ben's and Brother Justin's common recurring dreams chasing Henry Scudder in a cornfield, in Ben's microsleep-like visions, in Sofie's visions of the rape of her mother, and in an extended vision of Brother Justin foreshadowing his dark future. Ben encounters {{a little boy with}} a similar tree painted to his <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> back late in Season 1. Brother Justin finds this tree grown on a hill early in Season 2, which prompts him to get his <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> back tattooed accordingly. The tree is also depicted in the show's Gospel of Matthias book, in a painting at the Templar Hall in Loving, New Mexico, and on many images in the room of Templar chaplain Kerrigan. Management and Wilfred Talbot Smith imply the tree's significance for the resolution of Carnivàle.|$|E
5|$|A normal dog has {{a muscular}} {{appearance}} {{with a deep}} <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> strong legs.

It has some waviness on the <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> otherwise lies flat on the body. The normal colour of a French Spaniel's coat is white with brown markings rather in shade from a light cinnamon to dark liver.

5|$|Although it {{wound up}} being {{faithful}} to the comics, many designs were made for Spider-Man's costumes: one concept costume designer James Acheson became fond {{of the idea of}} having a red emblem over a black costume. Another, which would eventually lead to the final product, featured an enlarged logo on the <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> red stripes going down the sides of the legs. To create Spider-Man's costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit's shape. It was designed as a single piece, except for the mask. The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut by computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.|$|E
