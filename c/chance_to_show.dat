5|$|As {{the final}} game of the 19981999 regular season, the 1998 Music City Bowl gave Virginia Tech and Alabama players a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> their skills prior to the 1999 NFL Draft. Alabama had one player {{selected}} in the draft. Cornerback Fernando Bryant was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the first round with the 26th overall selection. Virginia Tech had two players taken in the draft: defensive back Pierson Prioleau (110th overall) and guard Derek G. Smith (165th overall).|$|E
5|$|When Heikkinen was released, {{one writer}} noted that Heikkinen “was {{perhaps the biggest}} {{disappointment}} among the highly ballyhooed players who came up this season.” Brooklyn’ coach Clark noted that an “All-American man doesn’t mean a thing to us” in the NFL. Clark said: “Heikkinen weighed only 183 pounds and was pretty light for our league. He reported late and didn’t give himself a fair <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> me what he could do. I just didn’t think {{he was in the}} right physical shape and mental shape.|$|E
5|$|As {{the final}} game of the 2008–2009 regular season, the 2009 Orange Bowl gave Virginia Tech and Cincinnati players a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> their skills before the 2009 NFL Draft. Cincinnati had six players {{selected}} in the draft. Defensive end Connor Barwin was the first Bearcats player taken. He was picked in the second round, 46th overall. He was followed by punter Kevin Huber (142nd overall), cornerback DeAngelo Smith (143rd), cornerback Brandon Underwood (187th), cornerback Mike Mickens (227th), and guard Trevor Canfield (254th). Several Cincinnati players were signed as free agents after the draft. These included defensive tackle Adam Hoppel, linebacker Corey Smith, and offensive lineman Khalil El-Amin.|$|E

60|$|Harvest {{brought into}} Iowa {{at that time}} a flood of rough and hardy men who drifted north with the moving line of {{ripening}} wheat, and on Saturday nights the saloons of the county were filled with them, and Steve found many <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> his power.

5|$|At many of {{the early}} crucial battles of the Pacific, for {{instance}} Coral Sea and Midway, battleships were either absent or overshadowed as carriers launched wave after wave of planes into the attack at a range of hundreds of miles. In later battles in the Pacific, battleships primarily performed shore bombardment in support of amphibious landings and provided anti-aircraft defense as escort for the carriers. Even the largest battleships ever constructed, Japan's , which carried a main battery of nine 18-inch (46cm) guns and were designed as a principal strategic weapon, were never given a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> their potential in the decisive battleship action that figured in Japanese pre-war planning.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{had been}} a regular member of the Australian Test team since his debut in 1934, and {{immediately}} after World War II, he captained Australia in the inaugural Test against New Zealand. However, he was sidelined by injury in 194647 and Sid Barnes and Arthur Morris opened in the Tests, averaging 73.83 and 71.85 respectively. Brown resumed his Test career in the following season, replacing Barnes, but he was dropped after scoring 29 runs in two Tests. Barnes then came in and made 139 runs {{in the next two}} Tests, including a 112 in the Fourth Test. Morris was then rested for the Fifth Test to allow Brown another <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> his ability and make a case for continued national selection, and he made 99. In the Tests against India during the season, Barnes, Morris and Brown had shared the opening duties; their batting averages were 43.00, 52.25 and 42.66 respectively. In any case, Brown had done enough to tour England with The Invincibles in 1948, his third trip there, although Barnes and Morris were the first-choice opening combination.|$|E
5|$|Brown, Barnes and Morris {{shared the}} opening duties against the visiting Indians; their batting averages were 43.00, 52.25 and 42.66 respectively. With Brown recovered, the Australian {{selectors}} dropped Barnes {{for the first}} two Tests against the Indians. However, Brown struggled and made only 18 and 11 runsAustralia batted once in both Testsand was then dropped for Barnes, who made only 12 and 15 in the Third Test. Retained for the Fourth Test, Barnes made 112 in an Australian victory. Morriswhose place was securewas rested for the Fifth and final Test to give Brown another <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that he was worthy of selection. Barnes made 33 while Brown made 99 run out as Australia completed a 40 series win. In the end, all three were selected for the England tour, though Barnes had to give assurances about the amount of contact he would have with his wifestill living in Scotlandbefore he was confirmed. As specialist opening batsmen, the trio were competing for the two opening positions in Bradman's first-choice team.|$|E

However, the first one he considers as his [...] "football father", after Scolari was one who integrated him in Palmeiras by giving him <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> his rich talent. Under the rules of Muricy he won the Pernambuco state championship for Naútico in 2001.|$|R

Girls are free to choose an instrument that they would like to learn from the various Indian and Western music instructors. The school offers lessons in the instruments including sitar, harmonium, tabla, violin, guitar, piano, drums and synthesizer. Girls get many <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> their talent at school functions and inter school cultural fests.|$|R
5|$|From his {{experiences}} on board Belgica and Gjøa, Amundsen {{had learned the}} importance on long voyages of stable and compatible companions, and with these experienced personnel {{he felt he had}} the core of his expedition. He continued to recruit through 1909; the Fram party would eventually total 19. All of these except one were Amundsen's personal choices; the exception was Hjalmar Johansen, who was taken on at the request of Nansen. Since his epic march with Nansen, Johansen had been unable to settle down. Despite the efforts of Nansen and others to help him, his life became a spiral of drink and indebtedness. Nansen wished to give his former comrade a final <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that he was still a capable worker in the field; feeling that he could not refuse Nansen's wishes, Amundsen reluctantly accepted Johansen. The party contained two foreigners: a young Russian oceanographer Alexander Kuchin (or Kutchin), who was a pupil of Bjorn Helland-Hansen, and a Swedish engineer, Knut Sundbeck.|$|E
5|$|During the Australian {{season of}} 194748, which preceded {{the tour of}} England, Morris played {{in the first four}} Tests against the touring Indians, scoring 45 and an unbeaten 100 in the Third Test victory in Melbourne. He was omitted for the Fifth Test because the {{selectors}} wanted to trial other candidates for the 1948 tour of England. Morris ended the series with 209 runs at a batting average of 52.25, making him the third highest scorer as Australia won 40. During the series, he had opened with both Bill Brown, the veteran who had been a mainstay of Australian teams of the 1930s, and New South Wales teammate Sid Barnes. The Australian selectors chose Brown for the first two Tests against the Indians, but he struggled and made only 18 and 11—Australia batted once in both Tests—and was then dropped for Barnes, who made only 12 and 15 in the Third Test. Retained for the Fourth Test, Barnes made 112 in an Australian victory. Morris—whose place was secure—was rested for the Fifth Test to give Brown another <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that he was worthy of selection. Barnes made 33 while Brown made 99 run out as Australia completed a 40 series win. In the end, all three were selected for the England tour.

25|$|Mashud {{had little}} <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> his mettle as a one-day batsman, as he almost inevitably came to bat {{with his team}} struggling. Still, {{he managed to get}} a top score of 71*, against the Australians in 2005. With the Bangladesh spinners being more {{effective}} in limited-over games, Mashud had more <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> his class. His 91 catches and 35 stumpings in ODI testify to that.|$|E

50|$|Emperor Wu {{created the}} former Jin emperor the Prince of Lingling. He honored his {{stepmother}} Princess Dowager Xiao as empress dowager. He created his brother Liu Daolian, his sons, and his nephews princes. In fall 420, he posthumously honored his wife Zang Aiqin (臧愛親), {{who had died}} in 408, empress, and created his oldest son Liu Yifu crown prince. Also, having seen how much damage bad reputation can do to people first hand, he ordered that those who had been labeled undesirables by public opinion be allowed new <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> their worth.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, Dedé {{started the}} {{year on the}} bench and had very few <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> his skills at Vasco da Gama. However, in a game against Vitória, in the quarter-final of the Copa do Brasil, Dedé was {{selected}} {{due to the lack of}} available defenders and subsequently had his contract (which would end in a month) renewed until the end of 2010. He played very well and after a string of solid and impressive displays, became the defensive backbone of Vasco da Gama, becoming a fan favourite, heavily cheered by Vasco da Gama's supporters.|$|R
25|$|The Court {{stated that}} Riggins' Eighth Amendment {{argument}} that the forcible administration of antipsychotic medication denied him the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> the jury his true mental state at the sentencing hearing was not raised in the petition for certiorari and therefore was not addressed by the court.|$|E

The USA team went on to win that game by seven points.|$|E
25|$|He {{continued}} to play {{the next two years}} as the third-string catcher before serving as Dave Duncan's backup in 1971. Tenace entered the 1972 season backing up Duncan, but was given a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> his abilities by being made the team's regular catcher in the post-season. Tenace took full advantage of this opportunity, excelling in the 1972 playoffs and World Series. In the 1972 American League Championship Series against the Detroit Tigers, he drove in the clinching run in Oakland's 2–1 victory in game 5; it was his only hit of the series.|$|E
60|$|He {{still kept}} up his {{athletic}} exercise, {{and one of}} his favorite amusements was to go on long horseback rides, either alone, or with some relative or friend.

His family life was then, as it has always been, a happy one; but of this let us speak later.|$|R

25|$|He {{started the}} 195455 season {{in a similar}} fashion to the {{previous}} summer, scoring 122 in the opening match of the season against New South Wales. He scored 90 and 41 in the return match, and after making 53 in the next fixture, his steady progress was rewarded in 195455 when he was given his Test debut against England at Sydney in the Fifth Test. Australia had lost the series and this allowed selectors to give younger players a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> their skills. Unseasonal rain mean that play did not start until 2 p.m. on the fourth day.|$|E
25|$|On some dubious {{pitches in}} South Africa that winter, {{and in the}} {{following}} two English summers, England's unparalleled spread of bowling talent again gave Statham little <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> his ability, but in county cricket, even with no regular partner, Statham was still the most reliable bowler and almost never failed to produce some extraordinary analyses. In 1957 against Warwickshire at Edgbaston, he took 15 for 89; against Leicestershire at Old Trafford in 1958 13 for 64; and at Cardiff that year he and Tattersall bowled Glamorgan out for 26. His average of 12.29 that year was his best-ever {{but he was still}} only third in the first-class list due to large numbers of very helpful pitches.|$|E
25|$|Mumbai FC {{was officially}} founded at a grand launch in Mumbai on 27 June 2007. The club {{was created to}} provide Indian {{football}} another non-institutional club and to provide young aspiring footballers in the city a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> off their skills on a proper platform. Mumbai FC then set about their goals in which they {{wanted to build a}} strong first team, build a good youth development program which would serve as the platform in the ladder to the first-team for potential youngsters, build a good football culture in Mumbai, and develop the football infrastructure in Mumbai. The club started building their team straight away with the signing of Englishmen David Booth. The team then started making some major signings in Indian internationals Abhishek Yadav, Khalid Jamil, Noel Wilson, and Kalyan Chaubey along with potential youngsters Dane Pereira and Darren Caldeira. The team then added their first round of foreign players Felix Aboagye and James Dissiramah. The club then began their grassroots project in November 2007 with Aqueel Ansari being the head coach. Mumbai FC then participated in their first tournament, the Mumbai Football League Elite Division in 2007. Mumbai FC lost their match in the Mumbai Football League to RCF 2–1 with Dane Pereira scoring the first goal. Mumbai FC then won the first match in their history against Bengal Mumbai; in their second match, won 7–0 with Abhishek Yadav scoring four goals. The club then won their first-ever championship, the Abhijit Kadam Memorial Cup, in which Mumbai defeated then I-League club Vasco. The club then finished in second place in the Mumbai Football League Elite Division behind I-League club Mahindra United.|$|E

60|$|He {{was on duty}} at {{the time}} in the trenches. The Russians had been pretty quiet that night, but just before daybreak they made a sortie in {{considerable}} force. Our Corporal's company had to bear the brunt of the fighting, and suffered much. It was broad daylight before the Russians were driven back. Some of the more fiery men of the company pursued them too far, and were cut off. At last all the survivors returned to the trenches, and then the enemy commenced a furious cannonade, as if to revenge themselves for the repulse. Their sharpshooters, too, were on the alert, and if a man <b>chanced</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> the top of his shako above the earthworks, several bullets went through it instantly.|$|R
