40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effect of {{dexmedetomidine}} combined with propofol on brain tissue damage in brain glioma resection. Methods: A total of 74 patients who received brain glioma resection in our hospital between May 2014 and December 2016 were selected and randomly divided into Dex group and control group who received dexmedetomidine intervention and saline intervention before induction respectively. Serum brain tissue damage marker, PI 3 K/ AKT/iNOS and oxidation reaction molecule <b>contents</b> <b>as</b> well as cerebral oxygen metabolism index levels were determined before anesthesia (T 0), at dura mater incision (T 1), immediately after recovery (T 2) and 24 h after operation (T 3). Results: Serum NSE, S 100 B, MBP, GFAP, PI 3 K, AKT, iNOS and MDA <b>contents</b> <b>as</b> well as AVDO 2 and CERO 2 levels of both groups at T 2 and T 3 {{were significantly higher than}} those at T 0 and T 1 while serum SOD and CAT <b>contents</b> <b>as</b> well as SjvO 2 levels were significantly lower than those at T 0 and T 1, and serum NSE, S 100 B, MBP, GFAP, PI 3 K, AKT, iNOS and MDA <b>contents</b> <b>as</b> well as AVDO 2 and CERO 2 levels of Dex group at T 2 and T 3 were significantly lower than those of control group while serum SOD and CAT <b>contents</b> <b>as</b> well as SjvO 2 levels were significantly higher than those of control group. Conclusions: Dexmedetomidine combined with propofol can reduce the brain tissue damage in brain glioma resection...|$|R

5|$|The music, {{philosophy}} and lifestyle of heavy metal bands and fans were often panned by both left-wing critics and conservative public opinion, described as senseless, ridiculous {{to the limit}} of self-parody, and even dangerous for the young generation. The 1984 mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap addressed many idiosyncrasies of British metal bands, showing comic sides of that world which external observers would judge absurd. Instead metal musicians regarded the movie's <b>content</b> <b>as</b> much too real.|$|E
5|$|Although {{selenium}} is {{an essential}} trace element, it is toxic if taken in excess. Exceeding the Tolerable Upper Intake Level of 400 micrograms per day can lead to selenosis. This 400µg Tolerable Upper Intake Level is based primarily on a 1986 study of five Chinese patients who exhibited overt signs of selenosis and a follow up study on the same five people in 1992. The 1992 study actually found the maximum safe dietary Se intake to be approximately 800 micrograms per day (15 micrograms per kilogram body weight), but suggested 400 micrograms per day to avoid creating an imbalance of nutrients in the diet and to accord with data from other countries. In China, people who ingested corn grown in extremely selenium-rich stony coal (carbonaceous shale) have suffered from selenium toxicity. This coal was shown to have selenium <b>content</b> <b>as</b> high as 9.1%, the highest concentration in coal ever recorded.|$|E

5|$|Archelaus I {{maintained}} {{good relations}} with Athens throughout his reign, relying on Athens to provide naval support in his 410 BC siege of Pydna, and in exchange providing Athens with timber and naval equipment. With improvements to military organization and building of new infrastructure such as fortresses, Archelaus was able to strengthen Macedonia and project his power into Thessaly, where he aided his allies; yet he faced some internal revolt as well as problems fending off Illyrian incursions led by Sirras. Although he retained Aigai as a ceremonial and religious center, Archelaus I moved {{the capital of the}} kingdom north to Pella, which was then positioned by a lake with a river connecting it to the Aegean Sea. He improved Macedonia's currency by minting coins with a higher silver <b>content</b> <b>as</b> well as issuing separate copper coinage. His royal court attracted the presence of well-known intellectuals such as the Athenian playwright Euripides.|$|E
5|$|As of January 2015, Valve {{themselves}} had provided some user-developed Workshop <b>content</b> <b>as</b> paid-for features in Valve-developed games, including Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2; with over $57 million {{being paid to}} content creators using the Workshop. Valve began allowing developers to use these advanced features in January 2015; both the developer and content generator share the profits of the sale of these items; the feature went live in April 2015, starting with various mods for Skyrim. This feature was pulled a few days afterward following negative user feedback and reports of pricing and copyright misuse. Six months later, Valve stated they were still interested in offering this type of functionality in the future, but would review the implementation to avoid these previous mistakes. In November 2015, the Steam client was updated with the ability for game developers to offer in-game items for direct sale via the store interface, with Rust being the first game to use the feature.|$|E
5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon {{is a very}} {{bold and}} {{assertive}} wine that has potential to overwhelm light and delicate dishes. The wine's high tannin <b>content</b> <b>as</b> well as the oak influences and high alcohol levels associated with many regional styles play important roles in influencing how well the wine matches with different foods. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, all those elements are at their peak, but as the wine ages it mellows; possibilities for different food pairings open up. In most circumstances, matching the weight (alcohol level and body) of the wine to the heaviness of the food is an important consideration. Cabernet Sauvignons with high alcohol levels do not pair well with spicy foods due to hotness levels of the capsaicins present in spices like chili peppers being enhanced by the alcohol with the heat accentuating the bitterness of the tannins. Milder spices, such as black pepper, pair better due {{to their ability to}} minimize the perception of tannins—such as in the classic pairings of Cabernet Sauvignon with steak au poivre and pepper-crusted ahi tuna.|$|E
