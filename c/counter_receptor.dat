40|$|This study {{sheds light}} on the {{characterisation}} of CD 177 and identification of CD 177 s <b>counter</b> <b>receptor</b> on endothelium. We could demonstrate that PECAM- 1 on endothelial cells functions directly as the <b>counter</b> <b>receptor</b> for CD 177 by following observations; 1. Our recombinant CD 177 -Fc fusion protein, which was produced in insect cells, reacted with 130 KDa molecules on endothelium. 2. Screening with different mabs identified the 130 KDa protein as endothelial PECAM- 1. 3. Biochemical and immunological studies using recombinant CD 177 -Fc fusion protein confirmed that endothelial PECAM- 1 functions directly as the counter-receptor for CD 177. 4. Functional studies in vitro demonstrated that purified CD 177 protein inhibits CD 177 mediated cell adhesion to immobilized PECAM- 1 protein as well as neutrophil migration through endothelial cells. These results indicate that CD 177 can act as cell adhesion molecule involving neutrophil-endothelial interaction. This observation may provide a new concept in understanding the multi-step process of transendothelial migration. In the future, this concept should be studied in different in vitro {{as well as in}} vivo model in more detail...|$|E

Since cytoadherence to postcapillary venular endothelium is thought to be {{a major factor in the}} virulence of P. falciparum malaria, we have examined the interaction between ICAM- 1 and the P. falciparum-infected cell, and have compared it with the interaction to the physiological <b>counter</b> <b>receptor,</b> the leukocyte integrin LFA- 1.

Based on a nonbiased screen for galectin- 1 export mutants we have identified 26 single amino acid changes that cause a defect of both export and binding to <b>counter</b> <b>receptors.</b> When wild-type galectin- 1 was analyzed in CHO clone 13 cells, a mutant cell line incapable of expressing functional galectin- 1 <b>counter</b> <b>receptors,</b> secretion was blocked. Intriguingly, we also find that a distant relative of galectin- 1, the fungal lectin CGL- 2, is a substrate for nonclassical export from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Alike mammalian galectin- 1, a CGL- 2 mutant defective in beta-galactoside binding, does not get exported from CHO cells. We conclude that the beta-galactoside binding site represents the primary targeting motif of galectins defining a galectin export machinery that makes use of beta-galactoside-containing surface molecules as export receptors for intracellular galectin- 1...|$|R

Biophys. J. 73 : 2819 – 2835). For integrin-mediated aggregation (characteristic bond strength of 5 μdynes) {{in the absence of}} L-selectin contributions, an average forward rate of kf= 1. 57 × 10 − 12 cm 2 /s predicted the measured efficiencies for G= 100 – 800 s− 1. For a selectin bond formation rate constant equal to the integrin bond formation rate constant, the colloidal stability of unactivated neutrophils was satisfied for a reverse rate of the L-selectin–PGSL bond corresponding to an average bond half-life of 10 ms at a characteristic bond strength of 1 μdyne. Colliding neutrophils initially bridged by at least one L-selectin–PSGL- 1 bond were calculated to rotate from 8 to 50 times at G= 400 to 3000 s− 1, respectively, before obtaining mechanical stability in sheared fluid of either 0. 75 or 1. 75 cP viscosity. Thus for G> 400 s− 1, the interaction time needed for the rotating aggregates to become stable was relatively constant at 52. 5 ± 8. 5 ms, largely independent of shear rate or shear stress. Aggregation data and the colloidal stability criterion can provide a consistent set of forward and reverse rate constants and characteristic bond strengths for a known time-dependent stoichiometry of receptors on cells interacting in a shear flow field...|$|E
30|$|The current working {{hypothesis}} for leukocyte binding to VAP- 1 describes this binding {{as having a}} dual mode of function, as described by Salmi and Jalkanen [28]. The leukocyte first makes contact with VAP- 1 expressed on the endothelial cells by using its <b>counter</b> <b>receptor</b> {{to interact with the}} surface of VAP- 1. This part is played by the VAP- 1 epitope(s) recognized by certain monoclonal antibodies. After this initial contact, an amine in the surface of the leukocyte binds into the substrate channel of VAP- 1. This leads to an enzymatic reaction between the leukocyte ligand (substrate) and the endothelial VAP- 1. These two events are connected because the enzymatic function is needed for leukocyte binding [29]. Blocking of the antibody binding site with anti-VAP- 1 monoclonal antibodies, as well as the inhibition of the enzymatic activity, reduces the number of adherent cells under flow conditions [30].|$|E

Two a(l, 3) -fucosyltransferase genes, designated zFTl and zFT 2, were cloned from zebrafish. Sequence comparisons with other genes indicated that zFTl and zFT 2 share about 30 % amino acid sequence identity with human a(l, 3) fucosyltransferases. Although the a(l, 3) fucosyltrans-ferases cloned so far can be classified into three types—myeloid, Lewis, and leukocyte—by virtue of their amino acid sequences, phylogenetic analysis indicated that neither zFTl nor zFT 2 belongs to any of these categories. The expression of zFTl or zFT 2 in mammalian cells induces a(l, 3) fucosyltransferase activity to synthesize the Lewis x structure from pyridyl-aminated lacto-iV-neotetraose; however, lacto-iV-tetraose does not serve as a substrate.

30|$|Immune {{responses}} are fine-tune regulated {{through a combination}} of stimulatory and inhibitory molecules and signal pathways (Dunn et al. 2002). To generate efficient antitumor immune responses by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), inhibition of negative immune checkpoint proteins such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein (CTLA 4), programmed cell death 1 (PD- 1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L 1) are applied in recent clinical studies and trails (Brahmer et al. 2012; Topalian et al. 2012; Herbst et al. 2014). PD-L 1, which belongs to B 7 family, binds PD- 1 and CD 80 as <b>counter</b> <b>receptors</b> to offer negative signals that control and suppress CTL responses in both autoimmune responses and evasion of tumor immunity (Dong et al. 1999; Butte et al. 2007). PD-L 1 is often expressed by activated immune cells including T cells, B cells, myeloid dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. In addition, PD-L 1 has also been found to be expressed in tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells (Taube et al. 2012). Consequently, clinical trials of blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against PD- 1 and PD-L 1 in a variety of solid tumors show promising results and validate this pathway as a therapeutic target.|$|R

We studied the adhesion molecules involved {{in the formation of}} these structures. Central macrophages of erythroblastic islands isolated from the spleens of phlebotomized mice were clearly stained for vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM- 1). The surrounding erythroblasts of the erythroblastic islands strongly expressed the alpha 4 integrin of very late activation antigen 4 (VLA- 4 : alpha 4 beta 1 integrin), the <b>counter</b> <b>receptor</b> of VCAM- 1, whereas most reticulocytes and erythrocytes did not. Both monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against alpha 4 integrin and VCAM- 1 disrupted the erythroblastic islands cultured in the presence of erythropoietin. Moreover, adhesion of splenic erythroblasts to tumor necrosis factor alpha-stimulated mouse splenic endothelial cells, which showed high expression of VCAM- 1 but not intercellular adhesion molecule 1, was inhibited by the anti-VCAM- 1 and anti-alpha 4 mAbs. These findings suggest that VLA- 4 -VCAM- 1 interaction plays {{a crucial role in the}} formation of erythroblastic islands...|$|E
40|$|The ICAM- 1 /LFA- 1 {{interaction}} in glomerular leukocytic accumulation in anti-GBM glomerulonephritis. Recent studies of rat anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease have demonstrated a functional role for ICAM- 1 {{in the entry}} of leukocytes into the glomerulus, both in the early polymorphonuclear (PMNL) influx and the more delayed monocyte/macrophage infiltration. In the current study we used immunogold ultrastructural techniques to identify the exact sites of expression of ICAM- 1 (CD 54) in the glomerulus and the expression of CD 11 a and CD 18 by infiltrating glomerular leukocytes in the first 24 hours of accelerated anti-GBM disease in rats. In normal rats there was constitutive ICAM- 1 expression on the luminal surface of the glomerular endothelium and parietal epithelium of Bowman's capsule. In disease ICAM- 1 expression was progressively increased over 24 hours on a thickened, reactive glomerular endothelium, being most prominent on endothelium adjacent to the mesangial stalks. Mesangial cells demonstrated surface ICAM- 1 expression only in focal areas of superficial mesangiolysis. PMNL, the predominant glomerular inflammatory cell in the first 12 hours of accelerated anti-GBM GN, expressed abundant surface CD 18 which {{was present at the}} sites of adhesion of the PMNL to the glomerular endothelium. In contrast PMNL expressed only very sparse surface CD 11 a, suggesting that another β 2 integrin, Mac- 1, which shares a common β chain with LFA- 1 may be the more important PMNL <b>counter</b> <b>receptor</b> for ICAM- 1 in the glomerulus. Glomerular monocyte/macrophage infiltration became evident within glomerular capillary loops and the mesangium from 6 to 24 hours. These adherent and migrating leukocytes expressed abundant surface CD 11 a and moderate CD 18 particularly at their sites of adhesion to glomerular endothelium. The presence of both CD 11 a and CD 18 suggest that LFA- 1 is the important macrophage <b>counter</b> <b>receptor</b> for ICAM- 1 in anti-GBM GN. This is the first study to precisely localize the sites of glomerular ICAM- 1 in glomerulonephritis. The results suggest that the up-regulation of glomerular endothelial ICAM- 1 plays a role in the early adhesion and localization of glomerular PMNL via the Mac- 1 ligand and the later adhesion and migration of macrophages via the β 2 integrin LFA- 1...|$|E

SLC is a highly efficacious chemoattractant for lymphocytes with preferential activity toward naive T cells. Moreover, SLC induces firm adhesion of naive T lymphocytes via β 2 integrin binding to the <b>counter</b> <b>receptor,</b> intercellular adhesion molecule- 1, a necessary step for lymphocyte recruitment.

As such, the cell surface controls cell–cell interactions and functions such as adhesion and migration, and will transfer external cues to regulate processes such as survival, death, and differentiation. Redefining the cell surface by temporarily (or permanently) modifying the molecular landscape of the plasma membrane affects {{the way in which}} the cell interacts with its environment and influences the information that is relayed into the cell along downstream signaling pathways. This chapter outlines the role of key enzymes, the glycosyltransferases, in posttranslationally modifying proteins and lipids to fine-tune cells, ability to migrate. These enzymes are critical in controlling the formation of a platform structure, sialyl Lewis x (sLex), on circulating cells that plays a central role in the recognition and recruitment by selectin <b>counter</b> <b>receptors</b> on endothelial cells that line blood vessels of tissues throughout the body.

40|$|Cancer {{metastasis}} is {{a complex}} process involving cell-cell interactions mediated by cell adhesive molecules. In this study we determine the adhesion strength between an endothelial cell monolayer and tumor cells of different metastatic potentials using Atomic Force Microscopy. We show that the rupture forces of receptor-ligand bonds increase with retraction speed and range between 20 and 70 pN. It is shown that the most invasive cell lines (T 24, J 82) form the strongest bonds with endothelial cells. Using ICAM- 1 coated substrates and a monoclonal antibody specific for ICAM- 1, we demonstrate that ICAM- 1 serves as a key receptor on endothelial cells and that its interactions with ligands expressed by tumor cells are correlated with the rupture forces obtained with the most invasive cancer cells (T 24, J 82). For the less invasive cancer cells (RT 112), endothelial ICAM- 1 {{does not seem to}} play any role in the adhesion process. Moreover, a detailed analysis of the distribution of rupture forces suggests that ICAM- 1 interacts preferentially with one ligand on T 24 cancer cells and with two ligands on J 82 cancer cells. Possible <b>counter</b> <b>receptors</b> for these interactions are CD 43 and MUC 1, two known ligands for ICAM- 1 which are expressed by these cancer cells...|$|R
40|$|Initial {{observations}} {{suggested that}} C-C motif chemokines exclusively mediate chemotaxis of mononuclear cells. In addition, recent studies also implicated these chemotactic cytokines in {{the recruitment of}} neutrophils. The underlying mechanisms remained largely unknown. Using in vivo microscopy on the mouse cremaster muscle, intravascular adherence and subsequent paracellular transmigration of neutrophils elicited by the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (CCL 3, synonym MIP- 1 alpha) were significantly diminished in mice with a deficiency of the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 1 (Ccr 1 (-/-)) or 5 (Ccr 5 (-/-)). Using cell-transfer techniques, neutrophil responses required leukocyte CCR 1 and nonleukocyte CCR 5. Furthermore, neutrophil extravasation elicited by CCL 3 was almost completely abolished on inhibition of G protein-receptor coupling and PI 3 Kgamma-dependent signaling, while neutrophil recruitment induced by the canonical neutrophil attractants chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL 1, synonym KC) or the lipid mediator platetelet-activating factor (PAF) was only partially reduced. Moreover, Ab blockade of beta(2) integrins, of alpha(4) integrins, or of their putative <b>counter</b> <b>receptors</b> ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1 significantly attenuated CCL 3 -, CXCL 1 -, or PAF-elicited intravascular adherence and paracellular transmigration of neutrophils.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{previously}} {{shown that the}} transcellular migration of rat ascites hepatoma (AH 130 -MM 1) cells through a cultured mesothelial cell monolayer (MCL) is triggered with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) that stimulates actin polymerization and myosin light chain phosphorylation through the activation of Rho-ROCK (Rho-kinase) cascade. When, however, the motility of MM 1 cells on a glass surface was tested by phagokinetic track motility assay, LPA failed to induce the motility. Nevertheless, when the glass had been coated with fibronectin (FN), LPA could induce phagokinetic motility which was accompanied by transformation of MM 1 cells to fusiform-shape and assembly of focal adhesion. β 1 integrin, the <b>counter</b> <b>receptor</b> of FN, was expressed on MM 1 cells. Anti-FN antibody, anti-β 1 integrin antibody and cyclo-GRGDSPA remarkably suppressed LPA-induced phagokinetic motility. These antibodies suppressed LPA-induced transcellular migration through MCL, as well. These results indicate that actin polymerization and phosphorylation of myosin light chain through Rho activation are insufficient for inducing motility but the cooperative FN/β 1 integrin-mediated adhesion is necessary for both the phagokinetic motility and transcellular migration of MM 1 cells...|$|E

We have analyzed whether heat-stable antigen (HSA), a marker for immature leukocytes, is involved in such cell adhesion phenomena. HSA is a glycolipid-anchored, highly glycosylated surface protein differentially expressed on cells during the maturation of both the hematopoietic and nervous systems. We found that pre-B cells lacking HSA (due to targeted disruption of both alleles) can still bind via VLA- 4 to tumor necrosis factor alpha-stimulated endothelioma cells. This binding, however, cannot be blocked by an anti-VCAM- 1 antibody. Restoration of HSA expression restores the inhibitable VCAM- 1 binding. We also found that pre-B cells lacking HSA did not bind to the FN 40 fragment of fibronectin but reexpression of HSA restored VLA- 4 -mediated binding to fibronectin. Thus, expression of HSA on pre-B cells modifies the binding specificity of VLA- 4 for two known ligands...|$|E

Previous studies {{focused on}} lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA- 1) -expressing T cells as a molecular target for therapeutic intervention. By contrast, information on therapeutic effects {{and the underlying}} mechanism of blocking the LFA- 1 <b>counter</b> <b>receptor,</b> ICAM- 1 is scarce. Here, we used the CD 18 (β 2 -integrin) hypomorphic (CD 18 hypo) mouse model of psoriasis to investigate the therapeutic role of extracellular adherence protein (Eap) of Staphylococcus aureus, which exerts antiinflammatory activities by interacting with the ICAM- 1 function. We show that ICAM- 1 is predominantly upregulated on endothelial cells in lesional skin of CD 18 hypo mice. In vitro Eap was found to disrupt cell–cell contacts between T cells and dendritic cells, and inhibit T-cell proliferation. By contrast, in vivo Eap rather blocked transmigration of T cells from vessels to inflamed skin of CD 18 hypo mice, but did not inhibit their proliferation and activation. Most importantly, Eap successfully suppressed the disease by blocking T-cell extravasation into the inflamed skin. Together, these data indicate that interaction between LFA- 1 and ICAM- 1 is causally involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasiform skin inflammation, and targeting ICAM- 1 to selectively block T-cell extravasation by Eap without immune suppression may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for psoriasis...|$|E
40|$|The B {{lymphocyte}} cell surface receptor CD 22 is an adhesion molecule that can mediate binding to several leukocyte subsets. The first CD 22 ligand {{to be identified}} was the receptor-linked phosphotyrosine phosphatase CD 45, but several lines of evidence suggest that CD 22 may interact with multiple <b>counter</b> <b>receptors</b> on adjacent lymphocytes. In the present work, we show {{that in addition to}} CD 45, a soluble CD 22 -immunoglobulin fusion protein (CD 22 Rg) recognizes several other distinct lymphocyte sialoglycoproteins. CD 22 -mediated adhesion is dependent upon the presence of sialic acids on ligands. CD 22 Rg is observed to bind specifically to a 115 -kDa sialoglycoprotein in COS cells transfected with an alpha- 2, 6 -sialyltransferase cDNA, but not in COS cells transfected with unrelated cDNA clones, indicating that at least some CD 22 -mediated interactions require presentation of sialic acid in an alpha- 2, 6 linkage by CD 22 ligands. In all cases, truncation of the side chain of sialic acids by mild periodate oxidation abolishes recognition by CD 22 Rg. Direct binding of CD 22 Rg to lymphoid cells also requires sialic acids and their side chains. Taken together, these observations indicate that CD 22 is a sialic acid-binding lectin and may define a novel functional subset of immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecules...|$|R

RAC 1, a GTPase and key player, mediates signals leading to actin polymerisation and membrane breakdown during fusion process. Other essential molecules in this pathway are integrins, ILK, talin 1 and talin 2, CDC 42 and N-Wasp. In this thesis, I determined the epistasis of genes that {{are known to be}} essential in myoblast fusion by means of genetic experiments. My results show that activation of actin-nucleation by integrins is mediated by the small GTPase RAC 1. Furthermore, RAC 1 is activated by small GTPase CDC 42 in a linear fashion. Another scenario could be that both GTPases are activated simultanously and act together to activate actin-nucleation factors like N-WASp and WAVE. The accumulation of actin near the site of fusion can have several functions: (I) transport of fusogenes to/from the site of fusion, (II) generation of forces to produce and open fusion pores and (III) transport of excess membrane material from the site of fusion. Furthermore, I showed that the adhesion molecules VCAM- 1, JAM- 2 and MCAM are not essential for myoblast fusion in the mouse and the adhesion of a satellite cell to a myofiber in the satellite cell niche.

40|$|Antigenic {{stimulation}} {{is associated}} with enhanced adhesion between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APC). Binding of ligands to the T cell antigen receptor activates the adhesion function of lymphocyte function-associated molecule 1 (LFA 1; CD 11 a/CD 18). We demonstrate here that ligand binding to major histocompatibility complex class II (Ia) molecules also activates LFA- 1 function, providing a reciprocal mechanism for the induction of adhesion between T cells and Ia+ APC. Adhesion was affected by a qualitative change in LFA 1 molecules and was reversed by the protein kinase C inhibitor sphingosine. These results define a novel role for la molecules as signal transducing receptors that regulate LFA 1 -dependent adhesion via a putative, Ia-coupled protein kinase(s). Cognate recognition of APC by antigen-specific T cells is critically dependent on adhesive interactions mediated by LFA 1 molecules present on both T cells and APC (1). While LFA- 1 is constitutively expressed on lymphocytes, its adhesion function is activated after antigen-specific recognition (2). Engagement of the TCR by mAbs was recently shown to upregulate the affinity of LFA- 1 for its <b>counter</b> <b>receptors</b> (3, 4). This proceeds via intracellular signaling mechanisms that involve the activation of protein kinase C (PKC).

40|$|Immune cell cosignaling receptors are {{important}} modulators of immune cell function. For T cells, cosignaling receptors supply necessary secondary signals supporting activation or attenuation after engagement of antigen-presenting cells. The primary cosignaling receptors belong {{to either the}} Ig (CD 28 -like) or TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamilies. The CD 28 family is comprised of coinhibitory and costimulatory receptors. The three coinhibitory receptors are cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4, programmed death- 1, and B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA). Although cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 and programmed death- 1 interact with B 7 -Ig family counter receptors, the ligand for BTLA is less clear. From a protein–protein interaction screen, we identified the TNFR family member herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) as a <b>counter</b> <b>receptor</b> for BTLA. Here we show that HVEM binds BTLA with high affinity and can form a ternary complex with its known ligands homologous to lymphotoxin, showing inducible expression, and competing with herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D for HVEM, a receptor expressed by T lymphocytes (LIGHT) or lymphotoxin α and BTLA. In addition, binding of HVEM to BTLA attenuates T cell activation, identifying HVEM/BTLA as a coinhibitory receptor pair.

40|$|Interaction between {{vascular}} {{cell adhesion molecule}} 1 (VCAM- 1), which appears {{on the surface of}} endothelial cells in response to inflammation, and its integrin <b>counter</b> <b>receptor,</b> alpha 4 beta 1, on immune cells is responsible for targeting these immune cells to cytokine-stimulated endothelium. In addition to its role in the immune system, VCAM- 1 is also expressed in a developmentally specific pattern on differentiating skeletal muscle, where it mediates cell-cell interactions important for myogenesis through interaction with alpha 4 beta 1. In contrast to endothelium, there is high basal expression of VCAM- 1 in skeletal muscle cells and the expression is not cytokine-responsive. Here, we examine the molecular basis for these contrasting patterns of expression in muscle and endothelium, using VCAM- 1 promoter constructs in a series of transfection assays. In endothelial cells, octamer binding sites act as silencers that prevent VCAM- 1 expression in unstimulated cells. Tumor necrosis factor alpha overcomes the negative effects of these octamers and activates the promoter through two adjacent NF-kappa B binding sites. In muscle cells, a position-specific enhancer located between bp - 21 and - 5 overrides the effect of other promoter elements, resulting in constitutive VCAM- 1 expression. A nuclear protein binds the position-specific enhancer in muscle but not endothelial cells; thus the pattern of expression of this protein could control enhancer activity...|$|E

The latter {{are considered a}} reliable marker of a prothrombotic state and are associated with several cardiovascular conditions. The molecular mechanisms responsible of this cellular interaction include a central role of platelet P-selectin and of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand- 1 (PSGL- 1), its <b>counter</b> <b>receptor</b> on leukocytes in a signaling cascade, resulting in the activation of the beta- 2 integrin Mac- 1 and in the firm adhesion between the two cell types. The interaction of P-selectin with PSGL- 1 also induces upregulation of leukocyte tissue factor, biosynthesis of several cytokines and other inflammatory reactions, thereby contributing to the thrombotic progression. In this review the main determinants of mixed aggregate formation, the heritability component, the major pathological conditions associated {{with higher levels of}} mixed aggregates in the circulation will be discussed. Besides current anti-platelet or antithrombotic drugs, natural compounds, such as the polyphenols present in vegetable foods and red wine, have been tested for their inhibitory effect on mixed aggregate formation.

In all cases integrins and counterreceptors displayed similar pat-terns. On tubular cells of renal cortex, a marked upregulation of a 2 pu x 3 pu a. spu aj? 3 integrins and VCAM- 1 was observed {{with as many as}} 60 - 90 % of tubular cross-sections labelled, while a strong ICAM- 1 reactivity was limited to the luminal surface. The same adhesion molecules were also uniformly expressed on crescentic cells. In glomeruli, integrin upregulation occurred only on apparently preserved capillary tufts, i. e. in an early stage of lesion, while collapsed and sclerotic tufts showed a reduced integrin expression. In addition a morphometric study of extracellular matrix (EM) proteins cellular fibronectin and tenascin showed a 9. 56 + 1. 9 -fold and 3. 35 + 0. 6 -fold increase respectively in these proteins, as compared to normal kidney (P < 0. 001). The upregulation of avyS 3 on podo-cytes might {{play a role in the}} adhesion of crescentic cells. An increased production of cytokines, in particu-lar transforming growth factor-/?, might induce aug-mented deposition of EM proteins and upregulation of & and /? 3 integrins in RPGN.

40|$|Dendritic cells (DCs) act as {{a portal}} for {{invasion}} by human immunodeficiency virus type- 1 (HIV- 1). Here, we investigated whether virion-incorporated host cell membrane proteins can affect virus replication in DC-T-cell cocultures. Using isogenic viruses either devoid of or bearing host-derived leukocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA- 1), we showed that HIV- 1 production is augmented when LFA- 1 -bearing virions are used compared to that for viral entities lacking this adhesion molecule. This phenomenon was observed in immature monocyte-derived DCs (IM-MDDCs) only and not in DCs displaying a mature phenotype. The increase is not due to higher virus production in responder CD 4 + T cells but rather is linked with a more important productive infection of IM-MDDCs. We provided evidence that virus-associated host LFA- 1 molecules do not affect a late event in the HIV- 1 life cycle but rather exert an effect on an early step in virus replication. We demonstrated that the enhancement of productive infection of IM-MDDCs that is conferred by virus-anchored host LFA- 1 involves the protein kinase A (PKA) and PKC signal transduction pathways. The biological significance of this phenomenon was established by performing experiments with virus stocks produced in primary human cells and anti-LFA- 1 antibodies. Together, our {{results indicate that the}} association between some virus-bound host proteins and their natural cognate ligands can modulate de novo HIV- 1 production by IM-MDDCs. Therefore, the additional interactions between virus-bound host cell membrane constituents and <b>counter</b> <b>receptors</b> on the surfaces of DCs can influence HIV- 1 replication in IM-MDDC-T-cell cocultures...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{evidence that the}} cutaneous neurosensory system can directly modulate inflammatory responses in the skin by the release of neuropeptides such as substance P (SP). Dermal microvascular endothelial cell (DMEC) cellular adhesion molecule (CAM) expression {{plays a key role}} in directing leukocyte trafficking during cutaneous inflammatory responses. In recent studies, our laboratory examined the direct effect of SP on DMEC CAM expression and function in vitro and in vivo. Our studies indicate that DMEC express high affinity functional receptors for SP. After exposure to SP, DMEC expressed significant levels of both intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1), which was accompanied by increased binding to leukocytes expressing the appropriate integrin <b>counter</b> <b>receptors</b> for these CAM. We then determined the in vivo effect of released neuropeptides on DMEC CAM expression. Our results indicate that the topical cutaneous application of the neuropeptide-releasing agent capsaicin resulted in increased ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1 immunostaining of microvascular cells in the skin of human volunteers. Little is known regarding the cellular regulatory events by which SP modulates DMEC CAM expression. Our studies indicate that SP-induced cellular Ca+ 2 signals led to the activation of the NF-κB pathway, resulting in nuclear translocation of p 65 /p 50 heterodimers that bind to high-affinity tandem κB sites on the VCAM- 1 promoter, whereas SP activation induced NF-AT activation and ICAM- 1 DNA binding. Thus, these studies further support the role of the cutaneous neurologic system in modulating inflammatory processes in the skin...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Human CD 2 is a transmembrane cell surface {{glycoprotein}} {{found on}} T lymphocytes and {{natural killer cells}} and plays important roles in immune recognition. The interaction between human CD 2 and its <b>counter</b> <b>receptor</b> CD 58 facilitates surface adhesion between helper T lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells {{as well as between}} cytolytic effectors and target cells. In this study, the molecular effect of glycosylation of CD 2 on the structure and dynamics of the CD 2 -CD 58 adhesion complex were examined via MD simulation to help understand the fundamental mechanism of glycosylation that controls CD 2 -CD 58 adhesion. The present result and detailed analysis revealed that the binding interaction of human CD 2 -CD 58 is dominated by three hot spots that form a binding triangle whose topology is critical for stable binding of CD 2 -CD 58. Our study found that the conformation of human CD 2, represented by the topology of this binding triangle, is significantly adjusted and steered by glycosylation toward a particular conformation that energetically stabilizes the CD 2 -CD 58 complex. Thus, the fundamental mechanism of glycosylation of human CD 2 is to promote CD 2 -CD 58 binding by conformational adjustment of CD 2. The current result and explanation are in excellent agreement with previous experiments an...|$|E
40|$|CD 50 (ICAM- 3) {{has been}} {{identified}} as the third CD 11 a/CD 18 (LFA- 1) <b>counter</b> <b>receptor.</b> We investigated the expression and possible role of this molecule in the induction of early and late activation events in human thymocytes. We observed that CD 50 expression is acquired by early T cell progenitors (CD 34 +) and maintained during thymic development, reaching the highest levels in the most mature population of thymocytes (CD 3 high). Neither basal nor cytokine-induced expression of CD 50 was observed on untransformed human thymic epithelial cell lines. Cross-linking of CD 50 expressed on the surface of human thymocytes, by using mAbs recognizing epitopes not related to the CD 11 a binding site, transduced transmembrane signals leading to an increase of intracellular calcium concentration. This calcium mobilization was inhibited when CD 50 was co-cross-linked with CD 45, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation is also involved in CD 50 signaling. The same anti-CD 50 mAbs that were able to affect intracellular calcium levels were shown to induce CD 69 but not CD 25 expression on human thymocytes. This effect was preferentially observed on CD 3 low/CD 3 high thymocyte subpopulations. Cross-linking of CD 50 also significantly increased activation-induced cell death of human thymocytes. These results support the idea that CD 50 molecule can play a role in developing functionally mature T lymphocyte...|$|E
40|$|Orexins are neuro-modulatory {{peptides}} {{involved in}} the control of diverse physiological functions through interaction with two receptors, orexin- 1 (OX 1 R) and orexin- 2 (OX 2 R). Recent evidence in pre-clinical models points toward a putative dichotomic role of the two receptors, with OX 2 R predominantly {{involved in the}} regulation of the sleep/wake cycle and arousal, and the OX 1 R being more specifically involved in reward processing and motivated behaviour. However, the specific neural substrates underlying these distinct processes in the rat brain remain to be elucidated. Here we used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) in the rat to map the modulatory effect of selective OXR blockade on the functional response produced by D-amphetamine, a psychostimulant and arousing drug that stimulates orexigenic activity. OXR blockade was produced by GSK 1059865 and JNJ 1037049, two novel OX 1 R and OX 2 R antagonists with unprecedented selectivity at the <b>counter</b> <b>receptor</b> type. Both drugs inhibited the functional response to D-amphetamine albeit with distinct neuroanatomical patterns: GSK 1059865 focally modulated functional responses in striatal terminals, whereas JNJ 1037049 induced a widespread pattern of attenuation characterised by a prominent cortical involvement. At the same doses tested in the fMRI study, JNJ 1037049 exhibited robust hypnotic properties, while GSK 1059865 failed to display significant sleeppromoting effects, but significantly reduced drug-seeking behaviour in cocaine-induced conditioned place preference. Collectively, these findings highlight an essential contribution of the OX 2 R in modulating cortical activity and arousal, a...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of effector and memory CD 4 cell populations depends upon both T cell receptor (TCR) engagement of peptide/major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II complexes and ligation of costimulatory molecules with <b>counter</b> <b>receptors</b> on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). We showed previously that sustained interactions with APCs could be crucial for optimal expansion of CD 4 cells and for {{development of}} effectors that secrete cytokines associated with Th 2 cells. Using an adoptive transfer model with TCR transgenic CD 4 cells, we now show that responses of CD 4 cells primed in B cell–deficient mice become aborted, but are fully restored upon the transfer of activated B cells. Although B cells {{have the capacity to}} secrete multiple cytokines that could affect CD 4 priming, including IL- 4, we were unable to distinguish a role for cytokines that are secreted by B cells. However, B cell costimulation via the OX 40 L/OX 40 pathway that has been implicated in CD 4 cell expansion, survival, and Th 2 development was required. Th 2 but not Th 1 responses were impaired in OX 40 L-deficient recipients and normal responses were restored with OX 40 L sufficient B cells. The results suggest that without engagement of OX 40 L on B cells, CD 4 cell responses to many protein Ag would be dominated by Th 1 cytokines. These data have important implications for strategies to achieve optimal priming of CD 4 subsets. Key words: CD 4 subsets • B lymphocytes • antigen-presenting cells • cytokines • Th 2 cell...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of major}} {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) and adhesion molecule expression by alveolar epithelium on the modulation of immune responses in the lung is not understood. We have developed efficient methods to isolate, purify and culture human alveolar epithelial cells (type II pneumocytes) in vitro. The expression of MHC and adhesion molecules by isolated, cultured and cytokine-stimulated alveolar epithelial cells was quantified by flow cytometry, and demonstrated the presence of T-cell ligands including class I MHC, HLA-DR and HLA-DP, intracellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1; CD 54) and lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA- 3; CD 58), but not vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1) (CD 106) or B 7 (CD 80). The proinflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) caused an up-regulation of class I MHC and ICAM- 1. In contrast, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) {{had little effect on}} the expression of these surface antigens by human alveolar epithelial cells. The functional activity of alveolar epithelial adhesion molecules was then studied by determining their ability to bind allogeneic lymphocytes. An increase in lymphocyte adherence to monolayers of alveolar epithelial cells was observed following in vitro activation. However, up-regulation of alveolar epithelial <b>counter</b> <b>receptors</b> with the proinflammatory cytokine gamma-IFN did not enhance adhesion. The adhesive interaction between CD 18 on lymphocytes and ICAM- 1 on alveolar epithelial cells was demonstrated by the use of blocking antibodies specific for both ligands. Blockade of LFA- 3 on alveolar monolayers also suppressed lymphocyte adherence. In conclusion, alveolar epithelial cells expressed MHC HLA-A, B, C, HLA-DR and -DP, and functional adhesion molecules including ICAM- 1 and LFA- 3...|$|R

To investigate whether there is altered expression and the clinical significance of soluble co-stimulatory molecules in asthmatic patients, plasma concentrations of sCTLA- 4, sCD 28, sCD 80 and sCD 86 in 51 adult allergic asthmatic adults with or without steroid treatment, and 35 sex- and age-matched control subjects were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cell surface expression of CTLA- 4 and CD 28 on {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) were analysed by flow cytometry. Results showed that the plasma sCTLA- 4 concentration was significantly higher in all asthmatic patients while sCD 28 and sCD 86 concentrations were significantly higher in steroid and non-steroid treated asthmatic patients, respectively, compared with control subjects (all P < 0 · 01). Significantly increased cell surface expression of CD 28 but not CTLA- 4 on PBMC was found in asthmatic patients compared with controls (P < 0 · 05). The plasma concentration and cell surface expression of CTLA- 4 were found to exhibit positive and significant correlations with those of CD 28 (both P < 0 · 05). Serum total IgE concentration correlated positively and significantly with sCTLA- 4 and sCD 28 concentrations in allergic asthmatic patients (both P < 0 · 05). The increased expression of these soluble co-stimulatory molecules may reflect the dysregulation of T cell activation, thereby contributing to the immunopathogenesis of allergic asthma...|$|R
