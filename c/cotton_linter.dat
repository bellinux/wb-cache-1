40|$|<b>Cotton</b> <b>linters</b> were hydrolyzed with {{different}} concentrations of HCl (2. 5 - 15 %) to prepare microcrystalline cellulose.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, and Fe 3 + ions and glucuronic acid on the viscosity, after dry or humid ageing, of two different cellulosic materials, <b>cotton</b> <b>linters</b> and dissolving pulp. The quantity of added metal ions {{was similar to that}} found in pulp. In the <b>cotton</b> <b>linters</b> sheets, especially in those containing Mg 2 +, increased 5 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl furfural (HMF) and 2 -furaldehyde (furfural) concentrations were accompanied by decreased viscosity under dry conditions at 180 C (pH 5). This indicates that Mg 2 + ions can promote the Lewis-acidcatalyzed degradation of cellulose. For <b>cotton</b> <b>linters</b> and dissolving pulp sheets, adding Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ions is detrimental when ageing at 180 C under dry conditions (pH 5). Adding glucuronic acid increases the viscosity of <b>cotton</b> <b>linters</b> sheets, especially when Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ions are present. Due to formation of complexes between the Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ions and glucuronic acid, these ions reduce pulp viscosity to a smaller degree...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe role of {{anthraquinone}} (AQ) greatly {{depends on}} the nature of the cellulosic pulp during alkali refining.

The cold refining helps the swelling <b>cotton</b> <b>linter</b> and the penetration of AQ leads to decrystallisation of linter even at low AQ concentration (namely 0. 025 %). In comparison with paper Kraft pulp AQ does not reflect a considerable change on its characteristics, except on hot refining using higher AQ concentration (namely 0. 2 %). This is due to the nature opening structure of the paper Kraft pulp in addition to the hemicellulose content which preferentially stabilized by AQ giving a reasonable increase in the pentosan content.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel method for introducing the RGD cell adhesion peptide to enhance cell adhesion onto bacterial cellulose (BC). BC and <b>cotton</b> <b>linters</b> as reference were modified with xyloglucan (XG) and xyloglugan bearing a GRGDS pentapeptide. The adsorptions followed Langmuir adsorption behavior, where both XGs probably decorate the cellulose surfaces as a monolayer. The adsorption maximum of the XGs reached around 180 mg/g on BC {{and only about}} {{three times as much}} on <b>cotton</b> <b>linters.</b> The adsorption was verified with colorimetric methods. The specific surface area of BC measured with XG and XG-GRGDS was about 200 m (2) /g and was almost three times less for <b>cotton</b> <b>linters,</b> 60 m (2) /g. The difference in the amounts of XGs adsorbed might be explained by the swollen network of bacterial cellulose and a more exposed and accessible bulk as compared to <b>cotton</b> <b>linters.</b> The nanocellulose material was modified homogeneously throughout the material, as seen by the z-scan in confocal microscopy. Moreover, the modification in the water phase, in comparison with organic solvents, was clearly advantageous for preserving the morphology, as observed with SEM. The modification slightly increased the wettability, which might explain the decrease in or undetectable adsorption of adhesive protein shown by QCM-D. Initial cell studies showed that adhesion of human endothelial cells is enhanced when the BC hydrogel is modified with XG-GRGDS. QCM-D studies further revealed that the cell enhancement is due to the presence of the RGD epitope on XG and not to a nonspecific adsorption of fibronectin from cell culture medium. Optimization and proliferation studies of human endothelial cells onto bacterial cellulose modified with XG-GRGDS are currently being carried out at the Vascular Engineering Center, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg...|$|R

They found that the nitrogen content of a cellulose nitrate from solventextracted <b>cotton,</b> <b>linters</b> could be varied by pre treatments of the starting material, using strictly physical methods which could promote no change in chemical composition. A mercerized sample of <b>cotton</b> <b>linters</b> which had a high nitration reactivity could be converted to a topochemical modification with a lower nitration reactivity by the simple operation of drying from water rather than through the solvent exchange series : water - methanol - benzene. It was the immediate purpose of the present work to examine in detail the dependency of the reactivity toward nitration on the pretreatment of cellulose, to increase or diminish the magnitude of the effect if possible, and to study the phenomenon in terms of a number of nitration variables. In a broader sense, therefore, the present work employed nitration as a means of studying the structure of cellulose in the range of magnitudes between the X-ray crystallites and the microscopically visible morphological building units.

Cotton linters is produced as a by-product accompany with cotton fibers which {{is used as a}} significant cellulosic sources in paper industry for producing durable paper. In this research, the influence of alternate adsorption of cationic chitosan and anionic Nanosilica on modification of fiber surface of <b>cotton</b> <b>linter</b> was investigated. The adsorption of materials on cellulosic fibers was analyzed via electrolyte titration. Experiments were conducted at pH≈ 3 - 4 for formation of cationic layer and pH≈ 9 - 10 for formation of anionic layer applying stirring rate of about 750 rpm, for 15 minute deposition time to construct 1 to 3 layers. Hand sheets of about 60 g/ m 2 basis weight were made form modified pulp fibers prepared by multilayering of chitosan and nanosilica, then their structural properties and bonding ability were evaluated. Bonding ability of fibers was improved by polyelectrolyte multilayering (PEM) on the surface of <b>cotton</b> <b>linter</b> fibers which was visualized by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM). The results showed that apparent density and also bonding ability was improved in the treated fibers because of the increased electrostatic attraction between polycation and anion sites existed on the fiber surface.

40|$|Xyloglucan is a {{hemicellulose}} {{found in}} the primary cell walls of many plant species. Found adjacent to the cellulose, it is believed {{to function as a}} cementing material which contributes crosslinks and rigidity to the cellulose framework. The only noncovalent linkage reported in the primary cell wall cellulose-hemicellulose-pectic polysaccharide matrix of the cultured tissues is that between xyloglucan and cellulose. Therefore, the xyloglucan:cellulose association has been of great interest to researchers. Xyloglucan can be bound to cellulose in vitro to simulate this in vivo relationship. Previously, the sorption of xyloglucan fragments onto cellulose under non-physiological conditions had been studied, but little information was available on xyloglucan polymer sorption onto cellulose under more natural conditions. This thesis examined the sorption of the xyloglucan polymer isolated from Tamarindus indica onto cellulose fibers (<b>cotton</b> <b>linters)</b> in an aqueous environment. The structure of the xyloglucan isolated from Tamarindus indica in this thesis resembled that of other tamarind xyloglucans reported in the literature. Due to the milder isolation procedure employed, the molecular weight of this polymer was much larger than those previously found. No acetyl, pyruvate, methoxyl, or carboxyl groups were found. The molecular weight and certain structural features (e. g., no fucose units) also differed from the xyloglucan found in plant primary cell walls. When sorbed onto well characterized <b>cotton</b> <b>linters,</b> this xyloglucan exhibited equilibrium sorption within 24 hours. The equilibrium adsorption isotherm was defined.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{of regenerated cellulose}} (RC) films and capsules was investigated for their applications in oral controlled drug delivery. Regenerated cellulose films were prepared by non-solvent-mediated, phase inversion of native and depolymerized <b>cotton</b> <b>linter</b> solutions (methylolcellulose; cellulose dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide/ paraformaldehyde solvent system) in water {{as well as by}} phase inversion of native <b>cotton</b> <b>linter</b> solutions in organic non-solvents followed by thermal annealing. These films were monolithic in dry state and formed porous structures when hydrated. Irrespective of the degree of polymerization of the starting cellulose source or the use of organic non-solvents, the cellulose chain length was not significantly altered and cellulose was in an amorphous state. Flux analysis in diffusion cells, using ethanol-water mixtures as the solvent medium, indicated that the films take up solvent to form porous routes for transport of solute. The amount of solvent uptake required to form these routes was greater for films prepared from depolymerized <b>cotton</b> <b>linter.</b> Ionic and hydrophobic solutes traverse the films using the porous pathways following hydration of the film. Blended RC films were prepared by combining native and depolymerized <b>cotton</b> <b>linter</b> solutions in varying ratios and phase-inverting in water, followed by thermal annealing. Porosity, pore size and water uptake of the hydrated films decreased, while the length of the transport pathway (tortuosity) increased, as the fraction of depolymerized cellulose increased in the blended films. Differences in methylene blue dye adsorption on phase-inverted vs. phase-inverted and thermally annealed RC films indicated that the type of non-solvent utilized for phase-inversion does not affect the internal RC film structure during the phase-inversion process. However, as the boiling point of the non-solvent increased, the amount of irreversible polymer consolidation and formation non-swelling domains (hornification) increased during the thermal annealing process. This, in turn, led to reduced porosity and solute flux through these RC films. Two-piece cellulose capsules were fabricated by phase-inversion of methylolcellulose solutions in water using a dip-coating approach. Zero-order release rates for a number of drugs increased as their water solubility increased. The release of water soluble drugs occurred by osmotically-driven convection and diffusion through the pores in the capsule wall, while the release of moderate to poorly soluble drugs predominantly occurred by diffusion. Moreover, as the drug solubility increased, the apparent permeability of the drugs through the capsule wall decreased, which indicated that the inward osmotic flux of water reduced the diffusivity of the drug through the pores. The hydraulic permeability of the cellulose capsules was determined to be higher than for conventional ethylcellulose and cellulose acetate coated osmotic drug delivery systems, indicating that the cellulose-based capsules may be better suited for osmotic drug delivery...|$|E

50|$|Cotton {{was first}} used {{with a mixture of}} silk to make paper called Carta Bombycina. In the 1800s, fiber crops such as flax fibres or cotton from used cloths (rags) were the primary {{material}} source. By the turn of the 20th century, most paper was made from wood pulp, but cotton is still used in specialty papers. As cotton rags now often contain synthetic fibres, papermakers have turned to second-cut <b>cotton</b> <b>linters</b> as raw material sources for making pulp for cotton papers.|$|R
