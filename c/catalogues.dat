5|$|Collectors {{tend to use}} the <b>catalogues</b> {{produced}} in their own region and language, so in the United States, Scott is used most often {{as evidenced by the}} use of Scott numbers in American stamp auction <b>catalogues.</b> In contrast, SG numbers are used in England and Ireland because Stanley Gibbons (a British publisher) produces the catalogue of choice in those countries.

5|$|The {{construction}} of memorials produced {{a lot of}} business in all the countries involved in the war. In Britain and Australia, stone masons provided large quantities of mass-produced design, often advertising through <b>catalogues,</b> while professional architects acquired the bulk of the specialised commissions for war memorials, making use of their professional organisations. Professional sculptors argued that their work was superior and more appropriate than that of architects, but they received far fewer commissions. British stone masons provided cheap products through <b>catalogues.</b> In France, funeral directors played a large part in the business of producing designs, producing <b>catalogues</b> of their designs for local communities to choose from. In the US, there was sufficient interest that a specialist magazine, Monumental News, was created to support the trade in war memorials.|$|E

5|$|In August, 1874, Ezra Abbot sent to Scrivener a letter: {{the rough}} draught of which covered forty odd pages, {{devoted to the}} {{correction}} of apparent errors and a statement of overlooked facts in {{the first edition of}} the Plain Introduction.

Abbot's studies largely argumented the number of suggestions, particularly in those portions of the book devoted to describing the extant manuscripts. They were accumulated in great part to the older and well-known authorities - such as Griesbach, Matthaei, Scholz (particularly his work Biblisch-kritische Reise, Leipzig 1823), Bianchini, Montfaucon, Silvestre, Bandini, Laubecius, and Zaeagni. Part of suggestions were a result of Abbott's studies of recent edited <b>Catalogues</b> of the ancient Greek Manuscripts held in the British Museum, Bodleian Library, Oxford <b>Catalogues,</b> Kitchin's Catalogue of the manuscripts in the Library of Christ Church College (Oxrofd, 1867).
