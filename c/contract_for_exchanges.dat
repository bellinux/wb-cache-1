This paper empirically examines how firms assign rights in collaborative R&D contracts, and highlights the significance of another factor that has received little to no attention in formal models. The fundamental problem that firms face in <b>contracting</b> <b>for</b> collaborative R&D is that intellectual property rights can be weak, yet efforts to control spillovers through contract can enable a form of hold-up. As a result, when firms design collaborative R&D mechanisms, they balance the risk of spillover against the risk of strategic blocking by their partners, and contract accordingly. We examine the contractual provisions of nearly 150 research joint ventures in a novel data set from the National Cooperative Research Act, and find systematic variation in how firms design collaborative R&D {{that is consistent with}} the spillover/blocking tradeoff theory...|$|R

40|$|A renouncement of a {{right to}} {{cooperative}} premises {{by a member of}} a housing cooperative in favour of that cooperative may take place due to various reasons and in various circumstances. Although Polish law on cooperative societies does not regulate the institution of a renouncement {{of a right}} in favour of a cooperative, such an act should be considered possible. It may pertain to a property-like right to a cooperative apartment, to a tenancy-like right to a cooperative apartment as well as to a right to cooperative business premises. A renouncement of a right to cooperative premises is a dispositional legal transaction causally involving increment of property, usually for a valuable consideration. A declaration to renounce such a right should be issued in a written form (ad probationem). Taking up the premises by a member of a cooperative is not a prerequisite for a renouncement of that right. The object of a renouncement is the right, not the premises. The said act may concern either a right to premises only, or that right together with the share in a cooperative society. A member cannot renounce a part of that right or a part of his/her apartment. In principle, only a member of a cooperative may renouncet that right. Exceptions concern the member's heirs and legatees since they may renounce the right without being members of a housing cooperative. One of the spouses may renounce the said right only when that right belongs to his/her separate property If the right belongs to a common matrimonial property, one of the spouses may renounce that right only if the consent of the other spouse has been granted. In the case of so-called independent common property with respect to a right to a cooperative apartment, the declarations of will of both spouses are necessary. In consequence of a renouncement, a right to cooperative premises expires. However, the relationship of membership in a cooperative remains intact. Two different situations should be distinguished. The first appears when a member renounces the said right just because he/she wants {{to get rid of that}} right and he/she wants the cooperative to grant that right to another person. The second situation takes place when the renouncement of that right is a part of a <b>contract</b> <b>for</b> <b>exchange</b> of an apartment concluded with a cooperative. The said contract needs to be properly qualified. A tendency to subsume it under Art. 603 and 604 of the Civil Code, regulating the exchange contract, is understandable, yet one should also keep in mind that here the object of exchange are not things but rights and that on the part of a member a transfer of a right does not take place since the right expires in consequence of a renouncement. In turn, a cooperative society creates a new right to a new apartment in favour of that member. Thus its act has no features of a translative transmission of a right. In practice, such an act leads eventually to the exchange of cooperative apartments. Thus one might assume that in such a case a "sui generis" <b>contract</b> <b>for</b> allocation of another right to premises, or — simplifying a little — a <b>contract</b> <b>for</b> <b>exchange</b> of a coperative apartment comes into existence.

40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} impact of {{informal}} institutions on private sector development. Informal institutions are critical in countries with weak formal economic institutions, such as inadequate bankruptcy and contract laws. In these countries, kinship systems, which are usually restricted {{to members of the}} same ethnicity or religion, offer a more reliable mechanism to enforce agreements. Based on experiences from Hong Kong, China and India, this chapter illustrates how different access to formal institutions influences the design of contractual arrangements. Depending on a manager's understanding of the country's formal and informal institutions, the quality of <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> business <b>exchange</b> varies significantly. In order to support the gradual development of open business networks, development agencies should foster informal economic institutions that support private business. In this context, it is vital to improve the flow of information about the availability, reliability and skill levels of suppliers, distributors and partner firms. Access to such information will reduce the costs of designing and managing contracts...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between formal and informal con tract enforcement The theoretical literature treats the two strategies as separate phenomena. By contrast, a rich experimental literature considers whether the introduction of formal contracting and state enforcement "crowds out" the operation of informal contracting. Both literatures focus too narrowly on how formal <b>contracts</b> create incentives <b>for</b> parties to perform substantive actions, while assuming that informal enforcement depends on preexisting levels of trust. As a result, current scholarship misses {{the relationship between}} formal and informal contract mechanisms that characterizes contemporary contracting in practice. Parties respond to ?sing uncertainty by writing contracts that intertwine formal and informal mechanisms?what we call "braiding"?in a way that allows each to assess the disposition and capacity of the other to respond cooperatively and effectively to unforeseen circumstances. These parties agree on formal <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> <b>exchanging</b> information about the progress and prospects of their joint activities, {{and it is this}} information sharing regime that "braids" the formal and informal elements of the contract and endogenizes trust. We argue that the low-powered enforcement associated with the formal governance structure in these braided contracts complements rather than crowds out the informal mechanisms that rely on increasing levels of trust. We examine the braiding phenomenon in a variety of contexts characterized by increasing uncertainty. In each instance, courts appear to have harnessed the braiding phenomenon by using low-powered sanctions to protect formal contractual "preliminaries. " This technique allows potential collaborators to explore and develop their relations, but it does not impose mutually enforceable obligations to pursue a particular project. Despite the wisdom of temperate enforcement of braided contracts, however, courts that emphasize the contemporary duty to negotiate in good faith are often tempted to expand the legal sanction. We conclude by explaining how courts can best support the braiding strategies that are {{critical to the success of}} an integrated regime of formal and informal contracting...|$|R

The understanding that a firm has of how a contract is formed and enforced in their home jurisdiction may conflict with that of their partners or customers in foreign jurisdictions, leading to unnecessary litigation.

In the 1920s, the federal government proposed the first regulation aimed at futures trading, and passed the Grain Futures Act in 1922.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) was established in 1974, under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act.

In the late 1970s, the relatively new managed futures funds began to gain acceptance. Although the majority of trading was still in futures <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> agricultural commodities, <b>exchanges</b> started to introduce futures contracts on other assets, including currencies and bonds.
