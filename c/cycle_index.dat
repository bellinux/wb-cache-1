40|$|Abstract- In this paper, we {{are going}} to explore the {{feasibility}} of periodicity of sunspot number activity during the solar cycles 21, 22, 23 & 24. The Sunspots are cooler and darker regions on the Sun's photosphere comparing to the surrounding regions. Sunspots usually appear in pairs. The two sunspots of a pair have different polarities, one would be a magnetic north and the other is a magnetic south, and can be joined by magnetic field lines. The number of sunspots that can be seen on the surface of sun increases and decreases in a regular pattern known as a solar cycle with a maximum number of sunspots occurring every 11. 5 years. This paper shows the comparison between the midrange periodicity in sunspot number for four different <b>cycles.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms- Sun, solar activity, sun spots number. ...|$|R
