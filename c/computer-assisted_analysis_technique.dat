40|$|Abstract — This paper {{examines}} <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>techniques</b> in extracting musical features from {{a recording}} of a speech by Mao Zedong. The data was used to prepare compositional material such as global form, melody, harmony and rhythm for TreeTorika for chamber orchestra. The text focuses on large-scale segmentation, melody transcription, quantification and quantization 1. It touches upon orchestration techniques but does not go into {{other aspects of the}} work such as constrained-based rhythm development. Automatic transcription of the voice was discarded in favour of an aurally based method supported by tools in Amadeus and Max/MSP. The data were processed in OpenMusic to optimise the notation with regards to accuracy and readability for the musicians. The harmonic context was derived from AudioSculpt partial tracking and chord-sequence analyses. Finally, attention will be given to artistic and political considerations when using recordings of such an intensively disputed public figure as Mao. I...|$|R

Although highly sensitive, AF has poor specificity, particularly in situations where there have been earlier biopsies or treatments such as radiotherapy. Narrow band imaging (NBI) is a newer imaging technique that enhances the early abnormal angiogenesis seen in preneoplastic lesions. NBI has higher specificity when compared with AF. We aimed to combine these imaging modalities, using AF as an effective screening tool and NBI to confirm AF findings.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to report the reproductive traits of mares by ultrasonography and hormone analyses in subtropical Taiwan and the successful artificial breeding of mares using a self-developed computer-assisted single insemination technique. A previously developed <b>computer-assisted</b> image <b>analysis</b> <b>technique</b> at our reproduction centre was employed to determine the optimal time for artificial insemination (AI). In the 8 mares that underwent this AI procedure, ovulations all occurred within 12 h post-insemination and 5 mares were impregnated (62. 5 %). The combined results of ultrasonic examination and hormone analyses showed that the mares in Taiwan were not only possible defined seasonal breeders, but also polyoestrous breeders that could be bred throughout the year.

40|$|Phenotypic {{traits are}} {{regularly}} used to diagnose {{the development of}} Fusarium head blight (FHB) in the field, whereas mycotoxin accumulation in wheat grains can only be accurately evaluated through costly methods, such as high–performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether: (i) the results provided by existing commercial decision support tools could be anticipated using phenotypic measurements, including a novel <b>technique</b> of <b>computer–assisted</b> image <b>analysis</b> of spikes; and (ii) these measurements could avoid using HPLC. We monitored the FHB development during two consecutive years in highly contaminated plots in the Burgundy region (France). Contamination by crop residues was simulated through a field inoculation with barley grains artificially colonized by Fusarium graminearum. The development of the disease on spikes and harvested grains was assessed on one tolerant and two susceptible wheat varieties. The accumulated amounts of mycotoxins were measured in harvested grains using HPLC. As expected, the measured traits revealed that the inoculum responsible for infection on spikes mainly came from residues left on the soil surface, and the susceptible varieties were more diseased than the tolerant variety. Weather conditions had a strong effect on disease development. The novel <b>computer–assisted</b> image <b>analysis</b> <b>technique</b> had a better prediction power of deoxynivalenol accumulation, was more objective and time–saving than classical visual symptom assessments. This assessment method could be suitable to supplement the use of existing prediction tools and might avoid systematic and costly mycotoxin measurements in likely infected plots...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{wishes to}} contribute to the sociological debate on protest movements by developing the notion of ‘contentious branding’ as a reflection emerging from the digital exploration of two empirical cases that challenge social movement theory: Occupy and Anonymous. The research was orientated by three interrelated questions operating at a methodological, empirical and theoretical level: How can digital research remediate the study of social movements? What sort of assemblages are articulated around the contentious brands Occupy and Anonymous? How does a branding perspective add to or amend traditional theories of social movements? The argument is built on a complexity-orientated epistemological background, interweaving insights derived from assemblage theory, actor-network theory, socio-semiotics and second-order cybernetics. The empirical research has been undertaken by means of digital techniques: Application Programming Interfaces of popular social media (mostly, Twitter and Facebook) have been pulled for data; the #Occupy and #Anonymous hashtags have been employed as research devices to set the limit of the analysis; and the datasets have been explored mostly by means of network <b>analysis</b> and <b>computer-assisted</b> content <b>analysis</b> <b>techniques.</b> The core contribution of the dissertation is to introduce and develop, within the field of social movement theory, the notion of ‘contentious branding’, to cope with the theoretical challenges highlighted by the empirical sections. A branding perspective on social movements not only fits these specific cases better: it intends to provide an epistemological and methodological device, to sustain a non-essentialist understanding of social movements, especially in the cases of digitalization of empirical phenomena and research methods...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Prolonged {{flurazepam}} exposure {{regulates the}} expression of selected (a 1, b 2, b 3) GABAA receptor subunit messenger RNAs in specific regions of the hippocampus and cortex with a time-course consistent with benzodiazepine tolerance both in vivo and in vitro. In this report, the immunostaining density of six specific GABAA receptor subunit (a 1, a 2, b 1 – 3 and g 2) antibodies was measured in the hippocampus and cortex, among other brain areas, in slide-mounted brain sections from flurazepam-treated and control rats using quantitative <b>computer-assisted</b> image <b>analysis</b> <b>techniques.</b> In parallel with the localized reduction in a 1 and b 3 subunit messenger RNA expression detected in a previous study, relative a 1 and b 3 subunit antibody immunostaining density was significantly decreased in flurazepam-treated rat hippocampal CA 1, CA 3 and dentate dendritic regions, and in specific cortical layers. Quantitative western blot analysis showed that b 3 subunit protein levels in crude homogenates of the hippocampal dentate region from flurazepam-treated rats, an area which showed fairly uniform decreases in b 3 subunit immunostaining (16 – 21 %), were reduced to a similar degree (18 %). The latter findings provide independent support that relative immunostaining density may provide an accurate estimate of protein levels. Consistent with {{the absence of the}} regulation of their respective messenger RNAs immediately after ending flurazepam administration, no changes in the density of a 2, b 1 or b 2 subunit antibody immunostaining were found in any brain region. g 2 subunit antibody staining was changed only in the dentate molecular layer. The selective changes in GABAA receptor subunit antibody immunostaining density in the hippocampus suggested that a chang...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background We {{recently}} {{showed that}} women with four clinical phenotypes of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) do not demonstrate anatomical evidence of elevated prenatal androgen exposure as judged by a lower ratio of the index (2 D) to ring (4 D) finger. However, those findings conflicted with a previous study where women with PCOS had lower right hand 2 D: 4 D compared to healthy female controls. Both these studies used Vernier calipers to measure finger lengths - a method recently shown to be less reliable at obtaining finger length measurements than <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>analysis.</b> Methods Ninety-six women diagnosed with PCOS according to the 2003 Rotterdam criteria had their finger lengths measured with <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>analysis.</b> Participants were categorized into four recognized phenotypes of PCOS and their 2 D: 4 D compared to healthy female controls (n = 48) and men (n = 50). Results Digit ratios assessed by <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>analysis</b> in women with PCOS {{did not differ from}} female controls, but were significantly lower in men. When subjects were stratified by PCOS phenotype, 2 D: 4 D did not differ among phenotypes or when compared to female controls.

40|$|Purpose The {{objective}} of this exploratory study is to propose a new methodological approach to investigate brand associations. More specifically, the study aims to show how brand associations can be identified and analysed in an online community of international consumers of fashion {{in order to determine}} the degree of matching with company-defined brand associations. Design/methodology/approach The methodology is two-pronged, integrating qualitative market research techniques with quantitative text mining. It was applied to determine types and perceptions of brand associations among fashion bloggers with reference to three leading Italian fashion houses. These were then compared to brand associations found in company-generated texts to measure the degree of matching. Findings The results showed consistent brand associations across the three brands, as well as substantial matching with company-defined brand associations. In addition, the analysis revealed the presence of distinctive brand association themes that shed further light on how brand attributes were perceived by blog participants. Practical implications The methods described can be used by managers to identify and reinforce favourable brand associations among consumers. This knowledge can then be applied towards developing and implementing effective brand strategies. Originality/Value The authors propose an interdisciplinary approach to investigate brand associations in online communities. It incorporates text mining and <b>computer-assisted</b> textual <b>analysis</b> as <b>techniques</b> borrowed from the field of linguistics which have thus far seen little application in marketing studies, but can nonetheless provide important insights for strategic brand management...|$|R
40|$|The studies {{presented}} in this thesis objectively quantitated the morphological characteristics, ultrastructural features and distribution of follistatin in the wall of dominant and subordinate ovarian follicles of cattle. Ultrasound image attributes of the follicle wall and antrum, and steroid hormone content in the follicular fluid of the dominant and subordinate follicles were analyzed. The dominant and subordinate follicles were obtained during the growing, early and late static, and regressing phases of Wave 1, pre-selection period of Wave 2, and after onset of estrus from the ovulatory Wave. The effects of active immunization against follistatin on follicular development, FSH concentration and superovulatory response in cattle were studied and correlations between ultrasound image attributes, and morphological and functional characteristics of the bovine corpus luteum were investigated. Changes in the morphology, ultrastructure {{and the distribution of}} follistatin in the follicle wall, steroid content of the follicular fluid and echotexture attributes of the follicle wall and antrum were all temporally related to the status of the dominant and subordinate bovine ovarian follicles as determined by wave emergence and diameter profiles of individual follicles. At the time of loss of functional dominance, the late-static dominant follicle of Wave 1 exhibited loss of its ability to produce estradiol and there was a decrease in thickness of the follicle wall, {{an increase in the number}} of degenerating granulosa cells, a decrease in the amount of smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum and follistatin in granulosa cells, and major changes in cellular and vascular components of the theca interna. Changes in the echotexture attributes of the CL and ovarian follicles were reflective of their structural and functional characteristics, indicating that a <b>computer-assisted</b> image <b>analysis</b> <b>technique</b> could be developed into a robust non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic tool to determine the functional status of ovarian structures. Follistatin was distributed in the granulosa layer of healthy follicles and in the CL at diesvus. Active immunization against follistatin caused subordinate follicles to grow longer, but no effect on circulating FSH levels could be detected. The results suggested that effects of follistatin on follicular dynamics are not mediated through changes in pituitary secretion of FSH...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To assess inter-rater {{reliability}} {{between different}} scorers, from different qualified sleep research groups, in scoring visually the Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP), {{to evaluate the}} performances of a new tool for the computer-assisted detection of CAP, and to compare its output with {{the data from the}} different scorers. Methods: CAP was scored in 11 normal sleep recordings by four different raters, coming from three sleep laboratories. CAP was also scored in the same recordings by means of a new computer-assisted method, implemented in the Hypnolab 1. 2 (SWS Soft, Italy) software. Data analysis was performed according to the following steps: (a) the inter-rater reliability of CAP parameters between the four different scorers was carried out by means of the Kendall W coefficient of concordance; (b) the analysis of the agreement between the results of the visual and <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>analysis</b> of CAP parameters was also carried out by means of the Kendall W coefficient; (c) a 'consensus' scoring was obtained, for each recording, from the four scorings provided by the different raters, based on the score of the majority of scorers; (d) the degree of agreement between each scorer and the consensus score and between the <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>analysis</b> and the consensus score was quantified by means of the Cohen's k coefficient; (e) the differences between the number of false positive and false negative detections obtained in the visual and in the <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>analysis</b> were also evaluated by means of the non-parametric Wilcoxon test. Results: The inter-rater reliability of CAP parameters quantified by the Kendall W coefficient of concordance between the four different scorers was high for all the parameters considered and showed values above 0. 9 for total CAP time, CAP time in sleep stage 2 and percentage of A phases in sequence; also CAP rate showed a high value (0. 829). The most important global parameters of CAP, including total CAP rate and CAP time, scored by the <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>analysis</b> showed a significant concordance with those obtained by the raters. The agreement between the <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>analysis</b> and the consensus scoring for the assignment of the CAP A phase subtype was not distinguishable from that expected from a human scorer. However, the <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>analysis</b> provided a number of false positives and false negatives significantly higher than that of the visual scoring of CAP. Conclusions: CAP scoring shows good inter-rater reliability and might be compared in different laboratories the results of which might also be pooled together; however, caution should always be taken because of the variability which can be expected in the classical sleep staging. The computer-assisted detection of CAP can be used with some supervision and correction in large studies when only general parameters such as CAP rate are considered; more editing is necessary for the correct use of the other results. Significance: This article describes the first attempt in the literature to evaluate in a detailed way the inter-rater reliability in scoring CAP parameters of normal sleep and the performances of a human-supervised computerized automatic detection system. © 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

40|$|Although {{classification}} of astrocytic tumors is standardized by the WHO grading system, which is mainly based on microscopy-derived, histomorphological features, {{there is great}} interobserver variability. The main causes {{are thought to be}} the complexity of morphological details varying from tumor to tumor and from patient to patient, variations in the technical histopathological procedures like staining protocols, and finally the individual experience of the diagnosing pathologist. Thus, to raise astrocytoma grading to a more objective standard, this paper proposes a methodology based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) derived images made from histopathological samples in combination with data mining techniques. By comparing AFM images with corresponding light microscopy images of the same area, the progressive formation of cavities due to cell necrosis was identified as a typical morphological marker for a <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>analysis.</b> Using genetic programming as a tool for feature analysis, a best model was created that achieved 94. 74 % classification accuracy in distinguishing grade II tumors from grade IV ones.
