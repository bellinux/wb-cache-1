5|$|Rob Van Dam (RVD) and Bill Alfonso {{interrupted}} the promo, with RVD stating {{it had nothing}} to do with SmackDown!. RVD claimed that WWE deserved no <b>credit,</b> <b>that</b> the interview was a shoot with no scripts, and that missing One Night Stand was worse than missing WrestleMania. The promo was interrupted when Rhino delivered a Gore. Van Dam's former tag team partner Sabu then appeared following the lights turning off, and had a match with Rhino. Sabu won the match with Van Dam's help, as Van Dam delivered a Van Daminator on Rhino before Sabu delivered the Arabian Skullcrusher on Rhino through a table for the victory.|$|E
5|$|In June 2012, Carrols {{acquired}} 278 BK locations from Burger King {{for approximately}} $150 million. In exchange, Burger King parent, Burger King Corporation took a 28.9 {{percent stake in}} the company. The transaction involved a line of <b>credit</b> <b>that</b> would be used by Carrols to renovate more than 450 of its stores and a 29.7% ownership stake in the franchise going to Burger King. Additional agreements will give Carrols the right of first refusal on approximately 500 stores. If it chooses to exercise these rights, Carrols could become the dominant franchisee of Burger King in the United States with possible control of hundreds of locations in twenty states. Three months after the acquisition, Carrols saw a 37.8% increase in total sales and 8.9% same store sales with a 4.9% increase in customer traffic. As of the end of Burger King's 2012 fiscal year, Carrols operates over 575 restaurants in New York, Ohio, and eighteen other states.|$|E
5|$|The {{termination}} of the operation caught the CIA by surprise, and King quickly attempted to salvage what he could. The freighter was redirected to Panama, where the arms were unloaded; King kept the weapons there {{in the hope that}} the project could be rejuvenated. Castillo Armas was paid a retainer of $3000 a week, which allowed him to maintain a small force. The CIA remained in contact with him, and continued to provide support to the rebels. The CIA found it difficult to end the operation without drawing attention to it. Peréz Jimenez opened a line of <b>credit</b> <b>that</b> would allow Castillo Armas to purchase airplanes, and Trujillo and Somoza continued to support the operation, although they acknowledged that it would have to be postponed. The money paid to Castillo Armas has been described as a way of making sure that he did not attempt any premature action. Even after the operation had been terminated, the CIA received reports from Seekford that the Guatemalan rebels were planning assassinations. Castillo Armas made plans to use groups of soldiers in civilian clothing from Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador to kill communist leaders in Guatemala. King continued to explore the CIA's ability to move arms around Central America without the approval of the State Department.|$|E

25|$|The {{main reason}} people {{choose not to}} {{contribute}} to online communities surprisingly {{does not have to}} do with societal laziness, but in fact the potential contributors belief that their entries will not be taken seriously or given the <b>credit</b> <b>that</b> they deserve.

25|$|In {{the late}} 13th and early 14th centuries, a process took place– {{primarily}} in Italy but partly {{also in the}} Empire– that historians have termed a 'commercial revolution'.

25|$|Prior {{to credit}} cards, each {{merchant}} had to evaluate each customer's credit history before extending <b>credit.</b> <b>That</b> task is now {{performed by the}} banks which assume the credit risk. Credit cards can also aid in securing a sale especially if the customer {{does not have enough}} cash on hand or in a checking account. Extra turnover is generated {{by the fact that the}} customer can purchase goods and services immediately and is less inhibited by the amount of cash in pocket and the immediate state of the customer's bank balance.

Geothermal heat pumps also qualify for tax credits up to $2,000.|$|E
25|$|Plagiarism is not {{the same}} as {{copyright}} infringement. While both terms may apply to a particular act, they are different concepts, and false claims of authorship generally constitute plagiarism regardless of whether the material is protected by copyright. Copyright infringement is a violation of the rights of a copyright holder, when material whose use is restricted by copyright is used without consent. Plagiarism, in contrast, is concerned with the unearned increment to the plagiarizing author's reputation, or the obtaining of academic <b>credit,</b> <b>that</b> is achieved through false claims of authorship. Thus, plagiarism is considered a moral offense against the plagiarist's audience (for example, a reader, listener, or teacher).|$|E

The piece has also been recorded in Colombia, Nicaragua, Cuba, and Panama by several music groups. The piece is sometimes sung by spectators in soccer matches and performed at music concerts across Ibero-America.

25|$|In double entry bookkeeping, debits and credits (abbreviated Dr and Cr, respectively) are entries made in account ledgers {{to record}} changes in value {{resulting}} from business transactions. Generally speaking, the sources for spending money in transaction account is <b>credit</b> (<b>that</b> is, an entry is {{made on the}} right side of the account's ledger) and what the money obtained with the credits is destined as debit in transaction accounts (that is, an entry is made on the left side). The credits here could be share capital, revenues, etc. and The debits here could be assests, dividends, etc. From a technical point of view the sides refer to the balance sheet placement of accounts. Total debits must equal total credits for each transaction; individual transactions may require multiple debit and credit entries to record.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1949, {{movie theater}} {{operator}} United Paramount Theatres (UPT) was forced by the U.S. Supreme Court to become an independent entity, separating itself from Paramount Pictures. For its part, ABC {{was on the verge}} of bankruptcy, with only five owned-and-operated stations and nine full-time affiliates. Its revenues, which were related to advertising and were indexed compared to the number of listeners/viewers, failed to compensate for its heavy investments in purchasing and building stations. In 1951, a rumor even mentioned that the network would be sold to CBS. In 1951, Noble held a 58% ownership stake in ABC, giving him $5 million with which to prevent ABC from going bankrupt; as banks refused further <b>credit,</b> <b>that</b> amount was obtained through a loan from the Prudential Insurance Company of America.|$|E

25|$|The García {{government}} tried {{a series}} of major and minor new policy packages from early 1988 into 1990 to no avail. The new policies never succeeded in shutting off the rapid infusion of Central Bank <b>credit</b> <b>that</b> was feeding inflation, even when they did succeed in driving production down significantly in 1989. Manufacturing production fell 18 percent in that year, agricultural output 3 percent, and total GDP 11 percent. Simultaneously, inflation increased from a record 666 percent in 1988 to a new record of 3,399 percent for 1989. The one positive change was the external current-account deficit: the fall in domestic production and income was so steep that the current account went from a deep deficit to a substantial surplus. The internal cost was perhaps clearest in terms of real wages: the minimum wage in real terms for urban labor fell 61 percent between 1987 and 1989, and average real wages in manufacturing fell 59 percent.|$|E
25|$|On the {{borrowing}} end, after 10–20 years, the S 500 corporations {{become extremely}} accustomed to obtaining funds via these money markets, {{which are very}} stable. Initially, perhaps they only borrowed in these markets for a highly seasonal cash needs, being a net borrower for only say 90 days per year. They would borrow here as they experienced their deepest cash needs over an operating cycle to temporarily finance short-term build ups in inventory and receivables. Or, they moved to this funding market from a former bank revolving line of <b>credit,</b> <b>that</b> was guaranteed {{to be available to}} them as they needed it, but had to be cleaned up to a zero balance for at least 60 days out of the year. In these situations the corporations had sufficient other equity and debt financing for all of their regular capital needs. They were however dependent on these sources to be available to them, as needed, on an immediate daily basis.|$|E
