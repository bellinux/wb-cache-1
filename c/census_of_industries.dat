Primary {{processing}} {{industries are}} part of the primary sector and make the sawmilling process generating tables of different sizes with just little finish. The GDP allows to know the behavior of the national economy and the Central Bank of Costa Rica is calculated from the value added of products distributed in accounts, however forestry provided in the agricultural account and other, causing its contribution can´t be clearly appreciated. As a way to counter it in 2000 Mckenzie establishes the methodology used by the Oficina Nacional Forestal (ONF) for determining the value added and thus the real contribution to the sector. The aim {{of this study was to}} update the methodology for value added contributed by the primary industry so that suits today in Costa Rica. Of the 108 industries sampled by the ONF in early 2014 a random sub sample of 28 industries were selected and stratified according to its annual production in cubic meters and were surveyed about: productivity, employment, energy sources, machinery and equipment load; From this information to their cost structures and value added is determined. For indirect calculation of the areas of the structure three methods were tested: the first; equations proposed by McKenzie (2000), the second; trend lines generated graphics distribution and the third; average percentage rate. The methods were statistically compared using analysis of variance with hypothesis that there were no significant differences between them, once rejected the hypothesis test least significant difference (LSD) was applied. It was found that the best paying job is the manager, however small industries there is not manager, also 85 % of machinery and equipment 75 % load used are depreciated. The higher costs are: raw materials and variable costs, the latter include the employ’s salary. Primary industries are highly heterogeneous, making it difficult to determine a single method that meets the variety of cost structures. No significant differences between methods for variable costs and depreciation for fixed costs while no differences between strata or methods; taxes if difference between methods but the LSD test proved otherwise. For fixed costs and taxes equation with average most similar to the weighted average value was chosen. The equations proposed by McKenzie (2000) for variable costs and depreciation remain in force, fixed exchange costs have risen by 193 % of depreciation and taxes 69. 89 % of employ’s salary. It is necessary to conduct a <b>census</b> <b>of</b> <b>industries</b> revalidate the proposed here from a larger sample. Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica, Escuela de Ingeniería Forestal...|$|E

The paper describes, for each of them, the methodology used and the progress made so far. Both the project on EPE incurred by General Government and the one on companies' EPE - aim at producing basic data for the construction of the satellite Environmental Protection Expenditure Account (EPEA), in application of the European guidelines on implementation of the SERIEE system of satellite accounts. As regards General Government, the method chosen at Istat for collecting and quantifying expenditure on environmental protection is budget analysis; specific ways to counteract the drawbacks of this method are applied.

It is found that this sector provides employment to nearly 60 million people through 26 million enterprises. In terms of employment generation, place of MSMEs is next to agriculture. Second All India <b>census</b> <b>of</b> Small Scale <b>Industries</b> (Financial Year 1987 - 88) had recorded 121. 74 per cent growth in employment in this sector.

The mapping aims at quantitatively characterizing the main characteristics of the coastal municipalities {{from the point of view}} of sector specialization. More in details, in this work, first we briefly quantified settlement pressure on the Italian coasts, then we provide a detailed analysis of economic specializations by sectors of coastal municipalities. Finally, we develop a more specific analysis on the specialization and dependence of coastal municipalities. This latter study is based on the classification of two specific groups of economic sectors: i) those that depend on the sea as the primary source input (tangible and intangible) and ii) those that do not depend on the sea but that have high environmental pressures. This second set of sectors can have adverse impacts, direct and indirect, on the marine and coastal environment - and consequently on the ‘marine' sectors. We then provide evidence of the relationship between sectors depending from the sea, i. e. ‘marine' sectors and sectors that have a high pressure on the environment, i. e. ‘high pressure' sectors in coastal municipalities.

This empirical fact suggests that planners economized on the costs of central economic coordination not by building unusually large enterprises, but by not building very small enterprises. Their most important finding: {{that there is little}} aggregate or industry concentration at the national level in Russia. Monopolies and oligopolies actually account for only a small share of national employment and production. Instead, barriers to competition in Russia arise as a result of highly segmented product markets. In large part, this segmentation {{can be viewed as a}} legacy of central planning. Under the prior regime, enterprises were highly isolated, divided alone both ministerial and geographical lines. Presently, these barriers are reinforced by some features of the transitional environment that continue to undermine the efficient distribution of goods. The authors conclude that the traditional policy remedies appropriate for problems of concentration (such as antitrust policy and import competition) may be ill-advised or inadequate for addressing problems of imperfect competition in the Russian economy. They argue instead that improving the distribution system and other market infrastructure that supports trade and facilitating the entry of new firms should be the most critical elements of competition policy in Russia.
