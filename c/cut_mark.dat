40|$|<b>Cut</b> <b>marks</b> {{can play}} a vital part in the {{interpretation}} of zooarchaeological data. For example, patt erns in the style and position of <b>cut</b> <b>marks</b> are taken as indicators of types of butchery practice. While butchery processes such as defleshing and evisceration may be fairly apparent and have been well researched, <b>cut</b> <b>marks</b> pertaining to skinning alone are much more ephemeral and have not been researched in as much depth. This paper explores issues regarding the relationship between <b>cut</b> <b>marks</b> and skinning, and highlights the variability that must arise {{as a result of the}} different species that can be skinned for their fur, the diff erent methods and tools that can be used, the different end uses of the fur and confounding effects of other uses of the species’ carcasses and pelts.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that fish are a common {{component}} of coastal and other aquatic archaeological sites, fish bone taphonomy [...] including bone surface modifications {{and the effects of}} burial [...] remains woefully understudied. Various ethnographic accounts describe fish butchering techniques for immediate consumption and drying, yet <b>cut</b> <b>marks</b> are rarely reported on archaeological fish remains. To address a significant gap in our understanding of fish taphonomy, I devised an experimental research program aimed at assessing whether butchering fish produces <b>cut</b> <b>marks</b> on fish bones and, if so, what factors might account for the discrepancy between the experimental results and the archaeological record. Chapter I provides an introduction to experimental archaeology, including the criticisms and benefits of this approach. Chapter II presents the results of my initial butchery experiment, which establishes that butchering fish can produce abundant <b>cut</b> <b>marks.</b> Chapter III evaluates the effect of the butcher's skill level on the number and distribution of <b>cut</b> <b>marks</b> produced on fish bone during butchery. The results indicate that professional butchers produce nearly 50 percent fewer <b>cut</b> <b>marks</b> than novice- and intermediate-level butchers. Chapter IV addresses the effect of post-depositional taphonomic processes on the long-term visibility of <b>cut</b> <b>marks.</b> Despite a relatively short burial period (27 months), visible <b>cut</b> <b>marks</b> decreased by up to 75 percent, depending on the species. Chapter V is a re-analysis of the fish bone from column E 6 at Daisy Cave (CA-SMI- 261). Appling the referential framework I acquired through the experiments, I identified 62 <b>cut</b> <b>marks</b> on bones dating from the Early to Late Holocene. A comprehensive understanding of aquatic resource use has implications for a broad range of archaeological topics, including our understanding of hominid diet and resource use; identifying butchery and processing practices among fishing peoples; distinguishing between human and natural agency in the accumulation of fish remains; and assessing questions of behavioral modernity and social complexity. As we continue to recognize the primacy of coastal adaptations throughout human history, it is increasingly critical to expand the breadth of our knowledge regarding the taphonomy of fish remains at archaeological sites.

40|$|In {{discussions of}} Paleolithic hominin {{behavior}} {{it is often}} assumed that <b>cut</b> <b>marks</b> are an unwanted byproduct of butchery activities, and that their production causes the dulling of stone tool edges. It is also presumed that Paleolithic butchers would have refrained from making <b>cut</b> <b>marks</b> to extend the use life of their tools. We {{conducted a series of}} butchery experiments designed to test the hypothesis that <b>cut</b> <b>marks</b> affect the use life of tools. Results suggest <b>cut</b> <b>marks</b> are not associated with edge attrition of simple flake tools, and therefore it is unlikely that Paleolithic butchers would have avoided contact between bone surfaces and tool edges. Edge attrition is, however, significantly greater during skinning and disarticulation than during defleshing. This suggests that skinning and disarticulation activities would require more tool edges relative to butchery events focused purely on defleshing. Differences between the number of cut-marked bones relative to the number of stone artifacts deposited at taphonomically comparable archaeological localities may be explicable in terms of different types of butchery activities conducted there, rather than strictly the timing of carcass access by hominins. Archaeological localities with higher artifact discard rates relative to raw material availability may represent an emphasis on activities associated with higher edge attrition (e. g. skinning or disarticulation) ...|$|R

5000|$|On August 7, 1781, a {{group of}} Tories and Native Americans forced {{their way into the}} Schuyler Mansion in Albany, searching for Philip Schuyler, whom they {{intended}} to make a prisoner of war. According to a story which may be legend, family members and guests, including Eliza and Angelica, who were both pregnant, ran upstairs to hide, but soon realized they had left Philip and Catharine Schuyler's newborn daughter Catharine (1781-1857) downstairs. [...] Peggy went downstairs to get the baby, but was threatened by one of the Native Americans, who asked where Philip was. Thinking quickly, Peggy replied that Schuyler had “gone to alarm the town”. Fearing capture, the raiders fled, but one threw a tomahawk at Peggy, who was running upstairs with the child.

40|$|Toolmark {{analysis}} involves examining marks {{created on}} an object {{to identify the}} likely tool responsible for creating those marks (e. g., a knife). Although a potentially powerful forensic tool, knife mark analysis {{is still in its}} infancy and the validation of imaging techniques as well as quantitative approaches is ongoing. This study builds on previous work by simulating real-world stabbings experimentally and statistically exploring quantitative toolmark properties, such as <b>cut</b> <b>mark</b> angle captured by micro-CT imaging, to predict the knife responsible. In Experiment 1 a mechanical stab rig and two knives were used to create 14 knife cut marks on dry pig ribs. The toolmarks were laser and micro-CT scanned to allow for quantitative measurements of numerous toolmark properties. The findings from Experiment 1 demonstrated that both knives produced statistically different <b>cut</b> <b>mark</b> widths, wall angle and shapes. Experiment 2 examined knife marks created on fleshed pig torsos with conditions designed to better simulate real-world stabbings. Eight knives were used to generate 64 incision cut marks that were also micro-CT scanned. Statistical exploration of these cut marks suggested that knife type, serrated or plain, can be predicted from <b>cut</b> <b>mark</b> width and wall angle. Preliminary results suggest that knives type can be predicted from <b>cut</b> <b>mark</b> width, and that knife edge thickness correlates with <b>cut</b> <b>mark</b> width. An additional 16 cut marks walls were imaged for striation marks using scanning electron microscopy with results suggesting that this approach might not be useful for knife mark analysis. Results also indicated that observer judgements of <b>cut</b> <b>mark</b> shape were more consistent when rated from micro-CT images than light microscopy images. The potential to combine micro-CT data, medical grade CT data and photographs to develop highly realistic virtual models for visualisation and 3 D printing is also demonstrated. This is the first study to statistically explore simulated real-world knife marks imaged by micro-CT to demonstrate the potential of quantitative approaches in knife mark analysis. Findings and methods presented in this study are relevant to both forensic toolmark researchers as well as practitioners. Limitations of the experimental methodologies and imaging techniques are discussed, and further work is recommended...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines cut {{marks on}} animal bone from Early Bronze Age Lerna in Greece {{to determine the}} material agent; a stone or metal tool. An experimental group of cut marks was produced to compare to the Lerna material. Both materials were analysed using a method yet {{to be used for}} <b>cut</b> <b>mark</b> studies, Micro-CT. Micro-CT was assessed whether it is an appropriate method for diagnosing cut marks on bone by comparing the results to SEM and light microscopy. In diagnosing the <b>cut</b> <b>mark</b> it was hypothesised that the profile and surface features will be important factors based on previous research (Walker and Long, 1977, Potts and Shipman, 1981, Greenfield, 1999, 2002, 2006). This study found that Micro-CT is excellent for showing the profile of a <b>cut</b> <b>mark</b> but not detailed surface features. Micro-CT also portrayed how the profile could vary, even within a single cut. For these reasons it was found profile alone is not enough to diagnose a <b>cut</b> <b>mark</b> and surface features are equally important. It was also found that comparing SEM, light microscopy, and Micro-CT was extremely beneficial as each technique has strengths and weaknesses. In regard to the Lerna material, it was found that three cut marks are almost certainly from stone tools and two cut marks are probably from metal tools. The findings add to evidence for the Bronze Age being a transitory period between stone and metal technologies...|$|E
40|$|Cut {{marks on}} bones provide crucial {{information}} about tools used and their mode of application, both in archaeological and forensic contexts. Despite {{a substantial amount}} of research on <b>cut</b> <b>mark</b> analysis and the influence of fire on bones (shrinkage, fracture pattern, recrystallisation), there is still a lack of knowledge in <b>cut</b> <b>mark</b> analysis on burnt remains. This study provides information about heat alteration of cut marks and whether consistent features can be observed that allow direct interpretation of the implemented tools used. In a controlled experiment, cut marks (n= 25) were inflicted on pig ribs (n= 7) with a kitchen knife and examined using micro-CT and digital microscopy. The methods were compared in terms of their efficacy in recording cut marks on native and heat-treated bones. Statistical analysis demonstrates that floor angles and the maximum slope height of cuts undergo significant alteration, whereas width, depth, floor radius, slope, and opening angle remain stable. Micro-CT and digital microscopy are both suitable methods for <b>cut</b> <b>mark</b> analysis. However, significant differences in measurements were detected between both methods, as micro-CT is less accurate due to the lower resolution. Moreover, stabbing led to micro-fissures surrounding the cuts, which might also influence the alteration of cut marks...|$|E
40|$|The {{butchering}} of {{wild boar}} during the Mesolithic in South Scandinavia {{has been studied}} through the analysis of <b>cut</b> <b>marks</b> on osteological remains from the sites Ageröd I:HC, Ringsjöholm, Tågerup and Bökeberg III in Scania, Sweden. The study reveals relatively high frequencies of <b>cut</b> <b>marks</b> from dismembering and filleting. The distribution of <b>cut</b> <b>marks</b> indicates a uniformity in the dismembering of wild boar, but it also reveals that two different techniques {{were used in the}} skinning of the mandible. A low frequency of dismembering marks on the bones from the lower extremities indicates a less intensive utilisation of the wild boar at Ageröd I:HC. The analysis reveals differences in both the frequency of dismembering marks and the number of black burned bones between sites from Scania, Sweden and Zealand, Denmark. The different age structures of the bones from wild boar recovered from the sites in Scania and Zealand indicate a differentiated processing of juvenile and adult wild boar during the Mesolithic in South Scandinavia...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{approach to}} cut-mark investigation has proved particularly successful and should arguably be {{a prerequisite for}} individuals interested in developing standard methods to study butchery data. This paper offers {{a brief review of}} the criteria used to investigate <b>cut</b> <b>marks</b> and subsequently outlines recent research that has integrated results from replication studies of archaeological tools and <b>cut</b> <b>marks</b> with written resources to study historic butchery practices. The case is made for a degree of standardization to be incorporated into the recording of butchery data and for the integration of evidence from the analysis of <b>cut</b> <b>marks</b> and tool signatures. While the call for standardization is not without precedent the process would benefit from a suitable model: one is proposed herein based in large part on experimental replication and personal vocational experience gained in the modern butchery trade. Furthermore, the paper identifies issues that need to be kept at the forefront of an experimental approach to butchery investigation and places emphasis on the use of modern analogy and cultural theory as a means of improving our interpretation of cut-mark data...|$|R
40|$|In {{forensic}} anthropology {{the analysis}} of microscopic tool marks found in skeletal sharp force trauma is a challenging area. Many different imaging methods have been employed to measure <b>cut</b> <b>mark</b> characteristics in aid of developing diagnostic tools for estimating knife type used for these marks. Furthermore numerous experimental methods for creating tool marks for analysis have been used. A novel method for creating, analysing and presenting tool marks using reverse engineering and metrology was investigated. 5 Pig torsos prepared to mimic human anatomy were stabbed using seven different knives. Following chemical defleshing the ribs were micro-CT scanned for {{the analysis of}} tool marks left from the knives. Other methods including SEM, Digital microscopy and Laser scanning were also considered. Various geometrical measurements of the <b>cut</b> <b>mark</b> micro-morphology were taken. These measurements were statistically analysed using SPSS. Knife types gave statistically significant different <b>cut</b> <b>mark</b> width, length, wall angle, floor radius and shape (p< 0. 001). Knife sub-types and individual knives also gave statistically significant differencing in width and shape (p< 0. 001). Statistical classification of cut marks as either serrated or non-serrated made marks was shown to be 90 % if width, length, wall angle and floor radius were accounted for. This indicated that determining knife type quantitatively is possible and could aid criminal investigators with their enquires. 3 D models of these cut marks could also be developed for potential use in court for forensic expert testimony...|$|E
