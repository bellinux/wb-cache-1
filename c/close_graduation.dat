40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Washington State UniversityHigh school {{graduation}} {{is an important}} milestone for students, {{but it is an}} elusive milestone for some. High {{school graduation}} rates reflect the systems that perpetuate historical, social, and cultural differences between groups of students, based on income, race, and ability levels. Disproportionate rates of students graduate from high school and, additionally, disproportionate rates of students graduate from high school prepared for college and career. The study features how a school district's committee of high school principals and district administrators implement action research as a professional learning strategy to address graduation rates and to <b>close</b> the <b>graduation</b> gap between groups of students, especially historically underserved students. Guided by a conceptual framework that combines elements of critical theory and adult learning theory, the study explores how school and district leaders learn to address barriers to graduation. The study uses data collected through phenomenological interviews, participant observations, document mining, and quantitative data, resulting in findings that align with and contribute to prior research. Themes from the study present how the committee collaboratively approached their inquiry and developed interventions and strategies to reduce barriers to graduation, while maintaining a commitment to the ideas, policies, and practices of social justice.

40|$|This {{case study}} explores the {{experiences}} {{of students with disabilities}} who have dropped out of high school, so as to identify related factors that led to their decisions. Participants included both males and females who were designated as students with disabilities at Ridgeville High School (pseudonym for a Virginia high school) and who dropped out between their third and fourth years of high school, during the 2010 to 2014 academic years. All participants were between the ages of 18 and 24. The case study was conducted through the use of semi-structured interviews, journaling, and observation of the sample population, with the aim of identifying common experiences among students who have dropped out of school <b>close</b> to <b>graduation.</b> The results of the semi-structured interviews were examined using reductive qualitative analysis, which included the use of coding and extraction of themes. The study results indicated that the overall sense of belonging of the students was low. The attitude of the students towards themselves, especially the nature of their disability, was another aspect that was found to be a great determinant of the reasons connected with high dropout rates of students with disabilities. The students also believed that more effort is needed from the teachers, their peers and the schools to help them in the school environment...|$|R
40|$|School districts create {{intervention}} programs {{to reduce the}} number of students who drop out of high school. This study evaluates the effectiveness of one intervention program used in a school district to help students at-risk of dropping out to recover missing credits through the use of a web-based curriculum. Suh and Suh (2007) found that out of three groups of risk factors for dropping out, lack of academic success has the biggest impact. Faircloth and O'Sullivan (2001) evaluated one intervention program and found that after being in the program 50. 3 % of students were back on track for graduation and 25 % were <b>closer</b> to <b>graduation.</b> The findings from this study compare how far behind students were before and after their time enrolled in the program, which could vary from a week to the entire school year. T-tests determined there was no significant difference in how far students were behind in credits before and after their enrollment in the program (t(35) = - 0. 96, p <. 05). A moderate correlation exists between the number of credits earned and attendance (r (34) =. 52, p <. 05). These results signal counselors that while test scores are not indicative of future success, attendance records are. A motivation survey would give more complete information in future studies regarding which students succeed in recovering credits in this program and which do not.
