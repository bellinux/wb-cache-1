40|$|Abstract: The main {{objective}} is to demonstrate the legal viability of assuring, to the defendant charged with smuggling, the same rights that are already available to the defendant charged with tax evasion in general. This effort takes in special account, here. the requirement of previous judgement of the administrative matters and the possibilíty of extinction of the punshability by repairing the damage. Contrary literature generally indicates as the main obstacle the absence of legal basis - what allows its classifícation as posilivist. The globalized reality of today recommends {{the study of the}} problem by an interdisciplinary approach. attentive to tributary and customs legal details, which implies the coherent understanding of the system, the respect to the possibility of judicial review and the overcome of this formalistic impediment. In this context, it is convenient to review specific criminal principies and to adopt them as safe criteria to contain and to reduce the administrativization of the criminal law based on tax, phenomenon that, in fact, is the very reason for the criminalization of tax evasion. Still, because it translates greater guarantee to the defendant, it is recommended the understanding of the previous end of the fiscal proceedings not as a punshability condition, but as a condition of action, in the modalities of apparení criminality and fair cause', for the same reason, not only the tax payment, but also the compensation for damage - ampler hypothesis, that contemplates the tax payment and the application of the forfeiture and the fine penalties - should be seen as motives for the exlinction of the punshability for smuggling. This theoretic adjustment is also justified because of the legal uncertainty that surrounds the entire academic production referring to the objective conditions of punshability. The research of the general characteristics of ali tributary crimes, allied {{to the study of the}} histórica! background of smuggling and tax evasion prosecution in Brazil, indicates that there are no theoretical or practical impediments to the equation proposed here, while the contrary positions present themselves as untenable. As this is a <b>customs</b> tax <b>crime,</b> it is indispensable a brief incursion into the rules of the administrative proceedings that corresponds to Treasury loss and underpricing hypothesis, both factual aspects that any smuggling charge must. necessarily, describe with minimally acceptable evidence. which may only be represented (or not) by the final administrative decision. If the sanction imposed administratively for the <b>customs</b> <b>crime</b> is satisfied - regardless of whether it is the constitution of a credit, the penalty of forfeiture, or the fine - the tax loss will be repaired and, automatically, the punshability of the smuggling crime will be extinct...|$|R

40|$|Initiated by the Alaska Criminal Justice Planning Agency, this is {{the first}} {{comprehensive}} study of public safety and the administration of justice in the predominately Alaska Native villages of rural or "bush" Alaska. Researchers visited 56 communities within seven of the twelve Alaska Native corporation regions in the state as part of an exploratory effort to collect crime and justice information for use by the State of Alaska in criminal justice policy development in rural areas of the state. Information was gathered in three ways: (1) review of available documents related to each of the communities; (2) direct observations of the communities and justice operations within them; and (3) structured interviews with community residents to elict both object and subjective information about operation of public safety and social control systems. The 175 interviewees included community officials, village police officers, health aides, and magistrates. [...] [...] The report addresses <b>customs,</b> law, and <b>crime</b> in village Alaska; context on justice services in Native communities; police services; legal and judicial services; prisoner detention and corrections; and recommendations for improving the delivery of justice services to rural communities. The study concluded that bush residents do not receive equal protection regarding public safety and justice services in comparison with their counterparts in larger Alaska communities; that the State of Alaska does not have have adequate data needed to identify and address public safety and justice problems in bush areas; and that bush villages and rural Natives are not homogeneous entities and hence require varied and particularized responses by the state...|$|R
40|$|Except {{for some}} {{southern}} islands where Islam had permeated since the 15 th century, {{the greater part}} of the Philippine islands had scarecely been affected by foreign cultures before Spaniards came to conquer the islands late in the 16 th century. Therefore you may suppose that the indigenous culture to Southeast Asia, if there was, would be maintained in this area longest. In this paper the present writer analyzes the social organizations and institutions of Pre-Spanish Philippine society, especially Tagalog society, which will consequently present some data by which you may infere a Southeast Asian‘infrastructure’suggested by G. Coedès. On the eve of the Spanish occupation the Filipinos were grouped into the small communities called barangay which was then the only form of political and social organization. Although there usually existed several barangays in a village which Spaniards represented by pueblo or poblaçon in their language, the overlordohip reigning over the whole village, that is, a regional grouping of barangays, had not been established yet. The following are the main conclusion on the composition and institutions of the barangay community which the present author has come to through the analyses from the chapter I to the chapter V of this paper. 1) Usually barangay consisted of from 30 to 100 families, which were all relatives of dato or the chieftains according to Fr. Juan de Plasencia. However it was not a kinship group in a strict sence of the word. Because the rule of descent of Philippine society is bilateral and barangay was not composed of a single bilateral descent group of dato. 2) The group fanctions of barangay were to abtain the exclusive possession of a certain space of earth for agricultural production and to protect the security of the members against outer enemies. 3) In the barangay complex there were four distinct classes, that is, dato or the chieftains, timagua or the freemen, namamahay and saguiguilir. The last two were the dependent classes subject to dato and timagua, and the Spanish records usually call both of them slaves. However, although saguiguilir were the real slaves who served their master in his house and on his cultivated iands, and could be sold, namamahay, having their own house and property, served their master with half of their cultivated lands on which they had the same usufract with timagua and could not be sold. 4) The main origins of these dependent people were those for loans, those for crimes and those by captivity. 5) Namamahay and saguiguilir could emancipate themselves by giving a set amount of gold to their master. On this occasion a ceremony took place between the master and the dependent. 6) The dependent status was hereditary. The children of a freeman and a dependent woman or of a dependent man and a free woman, were divided into two parts, the odd numbers and the even numbers, and the former succeeded the father's status and the latter the mother's. If there should not be more than one child, he was half free and half dependent. The same with the odd child, in case there were an add number of children. The possession of the individuai children whose parents belonged to seperate masters was decided in the same way. 7) The land ownership vested ultimately in the communal barangay. Howener, timagua and namamahay were able to dispose their cultivated lands at least within the barangay and their children could inherit these lands. 8) Strictly speaking there was no family property in this society. Husband and wife had one's own property in a household. All the legitimate children, whether male or female, inherited equally from each of their parents. 9) Marriage was commonly contracted {{between a man and a}} woman of the same class and they had a tendency to procure a spouse from their close relatives. On contracting a marriage the groom had to pay bride-price to the bride's family. 10) The social order of barangay was kept by the <b>custom</b> laws. The <b>crimes</b> and disputes which occured in the barangay were judged by dato in accordance with the <b>custom</b> laws. The <b>crimes</b> and conflicts concerned with two barangays were heard and judged by one or more than one dato who was chosen by the rest in the village. The cooperative relationship of the datos had been established to maintain the social order through the village...|$|R
