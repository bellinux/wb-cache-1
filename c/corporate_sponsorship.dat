5|$|Avery Brundage, as {{president}} of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interests as he felt that the Olympic movement should be completely separate from financial influence. The 1960 Winter Olympics marked the beginning of <b>corporate</b> <b>sponsorship</b> of the Games. Despite Brundage's strenuous resistance the commercialisation of the Games continued during the 1960s, and revenue generated by <b>corporate</b> <b>sponsorship</b> swelled the IOC's coffers. By the Grenoble Games, Brundage had become so concerned about the direction of the Winter Olympic Games towards commercialisation that, if it could not be corrected, he felt the Winter Olympics should be abolished. Brundage's resistance to this revenue stream meant that the IOC was unable to gain a share of the financial windfall that was coming to host cities, and had no control over the structuring of sponsorship deals. When Brundage retired the IOC had $2million in assets; eight years later its accounts had swelled to $45million. This was due to a shift in ideology among IOC members, towards expansion of the Games through <b>corporate</b> <b>sponsorship</b> and the sale of television rights.|$|E
5|$|Marcus {{was well}} known for {{cultivating}} the arts and for defending even unpopular political causes.

5|$|Barcelona {{ended their}} refusal of <b>corporate</b> <b>sponsorship</b> {{prior to the}} {{commencement}} of the 2011–12 season, signing a five-year, €150 million deal with Qatar Sports Investments, that meant the Qatar Foundation was on the club's shirt for the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons, then replaced by Qatar Airways for the 2013–14 season, the deal allowing for a commercial sponsor logo to replace the charity logo, two years into the six-year deal. The deal with Qatar Airways was extended for one more year in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Peach Bowl {{officials}} pronounced themselves {{pleased with}} both the turnout for {{the game and the}} action on the field. Though traffic jams snarled attendees' arrival to the stadium, there were only 5,366 no-shows out of 58,212tickets sold. Following the game, Peach Bowl chairman Ira Hefter announced that the bowl would seek <b>corporate</b> <b>sponsorship</b> and a potential television broadcast deal with a major American television network. The takeover by the chamber of commerce also proved to be successful, as the 1986 game made a small profit. This was an improvement over the three previous Peach Bowls, which lost more than $170,000. The sellout also confirmed that the game would continue to be held annually instead of being abandoned, as sportswriters had speculated prior to the 1986 game.|$|E

From 2004 to 2006, Ask the Audience was sponsored by AOL, which allowed users of its Instant Messenger to add the screen name MillionaireIM to their buddy list and receive an instant message with the question and the four possible answers, to which the users replied with their choices. In addition, the Ask the Expert lifeline was sponsored by Skype for its live audio and video feeds.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} half of the 20th century the IOC ran on a small budget. As {{president}} of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, Avery Brundage rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interest. Brundage believed the lobby of corporate interests would unduly impact the IOC's decision-making. Brundage's resistance to this revenue stream meant the IOC left organising committees to negotiate their own sponsorship contracts and use the Olympic symbols. When Brundage retired the IOC had US$2million in assets; eight years later the IOC coffers had swelled to US$45million. This was primarily due to a shift in ideology toward expansion of the Games through <b>corporate</b> <b>sponsorship</b> and the sale of television rights. When Juan Antonio Samaranch was elected IOC president in 1980 his desire was to make the IOC financially independent.|$|E
5|$|The 1956 Winter Olympics, officially {{known as}} the VII Olympic Winter Games (French: Les VIIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver) (Italian: VII Giochi olimpici invernali), was a winter multi-sport event celebrated in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. This celebration of the Games was held from 26 January to 5 February 1956. Cortina, which had {{originally}} been awarded the 1944 Winter Olympics, beat out Montreal, Colorado Springs and Lake Placid {{for the right to}} host the 1956 Games. The Cortina Games were unique in that many of the venues were within walking distance of each other. The organising committee received financial support from the Italian government for infrastructure improvements, {{but the rest of the}} costs for the Games had to be privately financed. Consequently, the organising committee was the first to rely heavily on <b>corporate</b> <b>sponsorship</b> for funding.|$|E
5|$|The Caribbean Carnival is an {{important}} part of Dominican culture. Originally featuring masquerade songs (chanté mas) and other local traditions, traditional Carnival, Mas Domnik, came to be dominated by imported calypso music and steel bands in the early 1960s; calypso appealed to Carnival-goers because the lyrical focus on local news and gossip was similar to that of chanté mas, despite a rhythmic pattern and instrumentation which contrast sharply with traditional Dominican Mas Domnik music. After a fire in 1963, the traditional Carnival was banned, though calypso and steelpan continued to grow in popularity. Modern Carnival on Dominica takes place on the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, and is a festive occasion during which laws against libel and slander are suspended. The modern Dominican Carnival is heavily based on the Trinidadian celebration, but is not as commercialized due to a lack of <b>corporate</b> <b>sponsorship.</b>|$|E

5|$|During {{his playing}} career, Martin greatly {{influenced}} {{the evolution of}} the sport of curling into a competitive sport. He was an instrumental part of the group that brought about the Grand Slam of Curling. In the early 2000s, he became the spokesperson for the promotion of the financial growth of curling, represented largely by the World Curling Tour, which was growing in popularity due to the benefits afforded by <b>corporate</b> <b>sponsorship</b> opportunities and cash prizes at tournaments. The Martin-led boycott of the Canadian Curling Association for its refusal to allow the developments in the World Curling Tour to be mirrored in the Brier catalyzed not only the transformation of the Brier, but also the growth of the Grand Slam, and in doing so, ultimately allowed the sport of curling to become a legitimate spectator sport. The development of the competitive tier of the sport also marked a change in both the players of the sport and the sport itself, as evidenced by improvements in the development and training of curlers as athletes and improvements in the quality of curling games due to better ice conditions and precision-based gameplay.|$|E
5|$|In early 2011, the Rage {{along with}} the Fresno Monsters, Wenatchee Wild, and Alaska Avalanche, all {{declared}} dormancy for various reasons, not committing to playing the next season; the Rage were pursuing entry into the AJHL. As the season was ending, the other teams in the division came out of dormancy; the Wenatchee team had their BCHL move denied and the Fresno Monsters were able to secure a lease agreement for their arena. The bid by the DC Rage Society to move the team into the AJHL, by purchasing {{the rights to the}} St. Albert Steel, failed as the Steel were moved to Whitecourt. While the team was achieving the expected levels of <b>corporate</b> <b>sponsorship</b> and had an average attendance of 1,010 people (13th best in the league of 28 teams), the Rage's costs (especially the travel costs) were higher than expected. In the first week of April 2012, a final appeal by the DC Rage Society to the City of Dawson Creek to cover certain fees was denied and the society announced the team was ending operations.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 Winter Olympics {{were held}} in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, {{the first time since}} NHL players were allowed to compete that the Olympics {{were held in}} a city with an NHL team. For the first time, Olympic games were played on a {{narrower}} NHL-sized ice rink, measuring 61metres×26metres (200ft×85ft), instead of the international size of 61m×30.5m (200ft×100ft). This change saved an expected $10million (CAD) in construction costs and allowed more spectators to attend games. Games were played at the UBC Winter Sports Centre and Rogers Arena (then GM Place at the time), which was renamed Canada Hockey Place during the event because <b>corporate</b> <b>sponsorship</b> is not allowed for an Olympic venue. Twelve teams qualified for the men's event and were split into three groups of four teams. At the NHL's request, the number of preliminary games was lowered to three. Following the completion of the preliminary round, all teams were ranked 1 through 12 based on points. The top four ranked teams received byes to the quarter-finals, and the other eight teams played for the remaining four positions. Following that, the final eight teams competed in a playoff.|$|E
50|$|However, the {{financial}} and organizational strain of producing the event proved too heavy for the arts group. In 1997, Whitman-Walker Clinic joined One In Ten as a co-sponsor of the festival, and the event was renamed Capital Pride. The street festival was moved off Freedom Plaza and onto Pennsylvania Avenue N.W. between 14th and 10th Streets N.W. <b>Corporate</b> <b>sponsorships</b> also rose dramatically, reflecting the festival's growing commercial nature. <b>Corporate</b> <b>sponsorships</b> reached $247,000 in 1999, up from $80,000 in 1998.|$|R
