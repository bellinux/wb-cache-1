40|$|Communication has {{developed}} during the years and is discussed to have become a central part in marketing, since {{it can be seen}} as the process where a company try to communicate the value of a product or a service to an end consumer. A relatively new way of communication is through the use of technology and internet, which has given companies new opportunities to communicate. Today does more than 91 percent of the Swedish population have access to internet. Businesses sees the online space as an opportunity to capture customers attention, which has lead to an increase in online businesses, also called e-commerce. It is more common than ever to shop online but the phenomenon can be seen as relatively new and therefore with potential risks that can affect consumers trust towards shopping online. A few studies have been done within the field of trust in e-commerce, however are there a lack of studies that suggests what variables that contributes to trust before a purchase, during purchase and after purchase. This thesis do therefore attempt to describe what it is that contributes to the perception of trust in e-commerce and which trust variables that are important throughout the purchase process online. This thesis is a qualitative research with a descriptive design. Based on theory about trust in e- commerce and the three purchase phases was a focus group guide designed in order to obtain data from six focus groups. The sample frame consisted of three age groups, which are based on statistics of online shopping behaviour. The study showed that trust plays an essential part when shopping online and that there are several variables that contributes to trust. Before an online purchase was it shown that variables such as word of mouth, information search, web design and delivery information is important. During the online purchase was information regarding price, delivery, return and payment but also safe transaction of personal information important in order to feel trust, where the online payment seemed to matter the most. After an online purchase was <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> <b>order,</b> delivery information, warranty and repair contacts considered to be the most important variables that contributes to trust...|$|E

Furthermore, the court had to determine what, if any, ancillary orders to make, and the relevant government department was best placed to assist the court in this regard.

In the act of revealing this relationship, this thesis will argue that the two cases demonstrate clothing’s importance in creating a visible <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> social <b>order</b> which ultimately brings to the surface an underlying collective ordering mentality that equated a sense of security with arranging everyone in society in their rightful place...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{development}} and implementation of a pharmacist-managed outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) program in a county teaching hospital are described. Summary A pharmacist-managed OPAT program was developed and implemented at a county teaching hospital to provide consistent evaluation, approval, and monitoring of patients requiring OPAT for the treatment of infection. The developmental and implementation stages of the OPAT program included (1) a needs assessment, (2) the identification of resources necessary for program operation, (3) delineation of general OPAT program operations and activities of individual OPAT clinicians, (4) the development of patient selection criteria, including a plan of care algorithm, and (5) acquisition of administrative support to approve the program. In this program, the OPAT pharmacist plays an integral role in the management and oversight of OPAT patients, working under a collaborative agreement with infectious diseases physicians. The OPAT pharmacist assists with appropriate patient and regimen selection, <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> <b>orders</b> on discharge, assuring that laboratory tests for safety surveillance are performed and evaluated, performing routine monitoring for adverse events and line complications, and assuring the removal of the vascular access device upon the completion of OPAT. Conclusion: The OPAT program provides structured monitoring, patient follow-up, and led to improvements in patient outcome with minimization of treatment and line-related adverse events...|$|R

The Constitutional Court, in a unanimous decision delivered by Chaskalson P, confirmed the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> the Transvaal High Court, but gave reasons that were {{different from those of the}} High Court. Two issues had to be decided by the Court. The first was whether or not the High Court’s order, setting aside the President’s decision, was a finding of “constitutional invalidity” that required confirmation by the Constitutional Court under section 172(2) of the Constitution. If so, the second issue was whether the President’s decision to bring the Act into force was constitutionally valid or not.|$|R

25|$|There is {{scholarly}} {{debate over}} the significance for the Carmelites of the decree at the Second Council of Lyon in 1274 that no order founded after 1215 {{should be allowed to}} continue. This action put an end to several other mendicant orders, including the Sack Friars, and the Pied, Crutched and Apostolic Friars. The Carmelites, as an order whose Rule had been promulgated by the Pope only after 1215, should in theory have been included in this set. Certainly, the rapidly expansion <b>of</b> the <b>Order</b> was halted after 1274, with far fewer houses established in subsequent years. Later Carmelite apologists, from the fourteenth century onwards, however, interpreted the Second Council of Lyon as a <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Order.</b> Such tensions may in part explain why, at a General Chapter in London in 1281, the order asserted that it had ancient origins from Elijah and Elisha at Mount Carmel.|$|R
