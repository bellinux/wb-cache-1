30|$|During the tequila fermentation, sugars from agave juice are {{converted}} mainly into ethanol, biomass and low {{amounts of}} aroma metabolites, which {{are responsible for}} the product sensory qualities. Due to its simplicity, batch cultures are traditionally used for tequila fermentation, which is generally recognized as the limiting step of the whole tequila manufacturing process, because of the long time period required (up to 7  days, for spontaneous fermentations) (Cedeño 1995). Compared to batch <b>fermentations,</b> <b>continuous</b> cultures have higher productivities and lower labor costs (Boulton and Quain 2007; Jackson 2008). Since the 1950 s, some attempts have been made for beer and wine production using <b>continuous</b> <b>fermentations.</b> Although, this technological alternative might bring attractive advantages to the tequila process, few <b>continuous</b> <b>fermentations</b> of agave juice have been performed and most of them have been regarded as an analytical tool, implemented to characterize physiologically yeasts isolated from spontaneous tequila fermentations, rather than a production alternative (Díaz-Montaño 2004; León Murillo 2005). Only three studies were focused on the utilization of <b>continuous</b> <b>fermentations</b> for tequila production purposes. (1) Del Valle-Ruiz (del Valle Ruíz 2007) reported a pilot scale continuous culture of S. cerevisiae fed with agave juice; however, the productivity found in this system was lower than that reached in batch fermentation. This result might be explained by a microbial contamination or a nutrimental deficiency in the agave juice. (2) Moran-Marroquín et al. (2008) studied the fermentative capacity and synthesis of aroma compounds of S. cerevisiae at laboratory scale using different dilution and aeration rates, and supplementing ammonium phosphate in the fed agave juice. The addition of ammonium phosphate and oxygen allowed the depletion of sugars and the increase of the dilution rate and ethanol production (i.e. derived in higher ethanol productivities). (3) Hernández-Cortés et al. (2010) carried out <b>continuous</b> <b>fermentations</b> at laboratory scale, using two S. cerevisiae strains, feeding sterilized or non-sterilized agave juice and controlling or not controlling the pH during the cultures. These authors reported that {{no significant differences were found}} on the fermentative capability of S. cerevisiae S 1 cultured at pH of 2.5  ±  0.5 (with no control of pH), between sterilized and non-sterilized media. <b>Continuous</b> agave juice <b>fermentations</b> showed higher productivities compared to batch fermentations; however, the maximum dilution rate reached in <b>continuous</b> <b>fermentations</b> (0.08  h− 1) was considerably lower than the maximum S. cerevisiae specific growth rate calculated in batch systems (0.28  h− 1).

Flocculation, besides allowing for the re-alization of high-cell-density systems with corresponding unusual high productivity, {{may be used as}} a selective property for controlling some contamination problems associated with prolonged continuous operation. © 200...|$|R
30|$|Flocculation is a {{very useful}} {{property}} for an industrial yeast strain, since it allows {{the separation of the}} biomass from the culture broth in a fast, cheap and innocuous way. Additional advantages include: i) flocculent yeast can be used in high density reactors with high productivity and reduced fermentation times (Teixeira et al. [1990]); ii) they can be used under different fermenter configurations with suspended biomass, thus avoiding the risk of biomass washout (Domingues et al. [2000 b]); and iii) flocculent yeast cultures have lower contamination rates, due to the culture’s high metabolic activity (Domingues et al. [2000 a]), when the yeast are grown in <b>continuous</b> <b>fermentations</b> conditions.|$|R
