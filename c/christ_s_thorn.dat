40|$|In {{dealing with}} the Pauline concept {{of the church as}} the body of <b>Christ</b> (<b>s</b> oma Christou), {{numerous}} New Testament scholars and others have tried {{to come to grips with}} a fundamental but yet unresolved issue [...] the nature of the relationship between Christ via his own body and the church as body. Embedded in much of the discussion is the implicit assumption that s oma Christou as ecclesiological language does point to Christ's once crucified but now risen body in some direct way. This thesis examines that basic assumption in the light of the 18 ecclesiological references to soma found in the Pauline corpus. We argue that such an assumption is implausible and we conclude that it is simply the human body (any human body) which acts as a metaphorical signifier for the church; further, that Christ's personal body, crucified and risen, becomes relevant only in a larger Christological and soteriological sense...|$|R

After poor take-off and landing results, he occupied the 8th position eventually. Due {{to lack of}} folding wings and engine starter, John Carberry fell from the 2nd to 11th position, only to regain this position thanks to best aircraft evaluation. However, mediocre take-off and landing results gave him the 6th place overall.

Poss took a lead, while Morzik fell to the 5th position after the aircraft evaluation, but Morzik's superb take-off and landing made him a winner, while Poss took the 2nd place.

The historical approach aims at understanding the centuries-old development of the holy site as a ritual space and the materialized expression of holiness, the ways in which it has been perceived and used, and the messages that it was meant to convey to its beholders. It combines the findings of previous archaeological research with the data provided by the analysis of written evidence, including old textual sources about the Basilica (especially chronicles and pilgrims accounts). For the archaeological study of the Basilica of the Nativity, we used the methodology of its investigation of the Archeology of Architecture.

Naujajame Testamente Dievas per Jėzų Kristų leidžia pažinti nuo amžių turėtą išganymo planą. Šis dieviškasis veiksmas atliekamas per išorinį Kristaus ir apaštalų palikimą ir per Šventosios Dvasios vidinį buvimą bei veikimą. Privatūs apreiškimai, jų autoritetingumas iš esmės skiriasi nuo dieviškojo Apreiškimo, kuris tik padeda tikėjimui ir pasirodo kaip tik per tai, kad asmenį kreipia į dieviškąjį Apreiškimą. Privačių apreiškimų vaidmuo nėra pagerinti ar papildyti Kristaus Apreiškimą, nes jis yra baigtinis, bet padėti jį pilnutiniau išgyventi tam tikru istorijos laikotarpiu. The {{teachings of}} the Church declare that public Revelation is true and, if {{understood}} correctly, faultless. In Christianity the basis of faith, life, thought and action of believers is the incarnated mystery of Jesus Christ. In brief, the Revelation is the God's revelatory action dedicated to all mankind, captured in the Bible which consists of two parts Old and New Testaments. God entrusts His Revelation to words of gospellers who represent the meaning of His will. God Himself chooses and calls people whom He entrusts to reveal events {{in the context of}} the Salvation. The Spirit of Jah-weh embraces a human- being, adopts his heart and makes him the tool of godly will. Thus the Revelation consists of both the events and the explanatory comments. The meaning of the events becomes clear when it is explained. In principle, the word of revelation is dynamic - acting and lively, which makes the salvation real by pro-claiming it and promising it at the same time. In the New Testament the Revelation is the free factor of the infmite God's love, which He allows to know Himself through the incarnation and reveals the plan of Salvation that He had since the beginnings through Jesus Christ. This Godly action is carried out through <b>Christ</b> <b>s</b> and apostles' outer legacy of and through the inner existence and action of the Holy Spirit. The God's Revelation in the Holy Script is for all people and all times. It is necessary to accept it and believe in it. Thus, there is no need to wait for any new revelation till the second coming of Christ. The authoritativeness of private revelations differs from the Divine Revelation in principle. The latter demands faith in Him through human words, as well as intercessions of the community of the Church God Himself speaks to us. The certainty that God Himself speaks through the Revelation guarantees people that there is Truth in Him. Any other form of human cognition cannot guarantee it. Private revelations only help to strengthen the faith and appear through it to direct a person to the Divine Revelation. Despite this, any Christian is not obliged to believe in Marys revelations even in the cases when the contents of revelations do not contradict to the entire faith and their authenticity (which happens rarely) is conflrmed by the Church's authority Even in these cases the revelations do not belong to the treasure of faith. Their role is neither to improve nor to supplement the <b>Christ</b> <b>s</b> Revelation, which is rinite, but to help to live it out to its fullest at a certain historic moment. The revelations can be useful, but the most important sources to know God are the Bible, the Tradition and the {{teachings of the}} Church. The Church does not oblige to believe in its approved private revelations but the hostility towards them might show another extreme as one forgets the freedom of God: a human-being cannot strictly limit ways of God's activities but we have constantly to endeavour ourselves to recognise His voice and respond to It with gratitude...|$|R

Plant Physiology, 138 (2), 898 - 908 Comparison of {{the extent}} of leaf {{senescence}} depending on the genetic background of different recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) is described. Five RILs of the Bay- 0 ?

The proportion of ?-aminobutyric acid, leucine, isoleucine, aspartate, and glutamate correlated with (1) the age and (2) the senescence phenotype of the RILs. Differences were observed in the glycine/serine ratio even before any senescence symptoms could be detected in the rosettes. This could be used as predictive indicator for plant senescence behavior. Surprisingly, late-senescing lines appeared to mobilize glutamine, asparagine, and sulfate more efficiently than early-senescing lines.

40|$|The {{struggle}} to read Jer 31 : 31 - 34 as Christian Scripture {{has a long}} and divided history. Yet remarkably little {{has been done to}} grapple with the depth of this struggle in the Christian tradition from the post-Nicene period to the modern era. This thesis attempts to show the value of the tradition as an interlocutor for contemporary exegetical concerns in Christian readings and use of Jer 31 : 31 - 34. The study begins with Augustineâ s interpretation of the text as an absolute contrast between unbelief and faith, rather than the standard reading (found in Jerome) of a contrast between two successive religio-historical eras - one that governed Israel (the â old covenantâ) and a new era and its covenant inaugurated in the coming of <b>Christ.</b> Augustineâ <b>s</b> absolute contrast loosened the strict temporal concern, so that the faithful of any era were members of the â new covenantâ. The study traces this reading of an absolute contrast in a few key moments of Christian interpretation: Thomas Aquinas and high medieval theology, then the 16 th and 17 th century Reformed tradition. 	The thesis aims at a constructive reading of Jer 31 : 31 - 34, and so the struggle identified in these moments in the Christian tradition is brought into dialogue with modern critical discussions from Bernhard Duhm to the present. Finally I turn to an exegetical argument for an â Augustinianâ reading of the contrast of the covenants. The study finds that Jer 31 : 31 - 34, read in its role in Jeremiah, contrasts Israelâ s infidelity with a future idyllic faithfulness to Yhwh: in the new covenant all will be as it always ought to have been. The contrast is thus between two mutually exclusive standings before Yhwh. Thus the study aims to contribute to modern exegetical, theological and ecclesial discussions of â oldâ and â newâ covenants by examining one of the central texts of the discussion in dialogue with parts of the history of interpretation...|$|R

In spite of the diamond stability, a strong chemical or electrochemical oxidation of the initially hydrophobic surface leads to the production of oxygenated groups, which are responsible for the hydrophilic character of the oxidized diamond surface. Once the modification has been obtained, its stability is so high that the pristine electrode surface can be recovered only by hydrogen-plasma treatment; moreover also the electrochemical properties of BDD are significantly modified and possibly useful characteristics become available. Results on both the thermal and the chemical oxidation of diamond specimens have appeared in the literature; {{as a consequence of the}} latter oxidation, different oxygenated species are formed on the sample surface, while the thermal treatment seems to cause a preliminary change in crystal morphology, followed by a chemical modification. Notwithstanding the above exposed interest on BDD, only a limited information is available concerning the effect of anodic polarizations on the chemical and electrochemical properties of these electrodes. Accordingly, the present work was based on electrochemical analysis and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy surface characterization of different BDD specimens. In particular, a detailed description of both the nature and the relative abundance of the dominant chemical species have been performed. Discussion and results have been mainly focused on the correlation between the observed quantitative and qualitative changes of the surface composition and the exhibited electrochemical properties.

40|$|Conquanto a expectativa comum da igreja cristã seja a ressurreição dos mortos para redenção plena dos que crêem em Cristo, entre os grupos católico-romano e protestante-reformado há divergência sobre o que ocorre durante o estado intermediário. O católico-romano crê nas doutrinas do purgatório e da intercessão pelos mortos razão pela qual reza para que a Santa Maria interceda na hora da morte e entrega-se a São José, o padroeiro da boa morte; participa da eucaristia, dá esmola, pratica obras de misericórdia, faz orações e oferece sufrágios em benefício das almas no purgatório; reza para que as almas {{dos santos}} defuntos intercedam por eles diante de Deus; louva à virgem Maria como a primeira, dentre todos os remidos, a ser ressuscitada dentre os mortos; e pratica boas obras para atenuar sua situação no dia do juízo final (em razão de crerem que a salvação é alcançada pela fé em Cristo e pelas boas obras). O protestante-reformado crê que enquanto a alma do justo está gozando da comunhão com Cristo, a alma do ímpio está sofrendo afastada de Cristo. Essa situação é temporária, pois ambos aguardam a ressurreição dos mortos e julgamento final para que tanto o justo possa desfrutar da salvação integralmente (no corpo e na alma) assim como o ímpio possa receber o justo juízo integralmente (no corpo e na alma) razão pela qual não intercede pelos mortos (nem mesmo tem o hábito de visitar os túmulos) e nem pede a intercessão dos santos defuntos; não pratica boas obras com vistas à salvação (nem mesmo procura ocasião para as boas obras); não pratica a extrema unção (mas evangeliza o moribundo no leito da morte); e mantém uma visão polarizada do status pós-morte: céu ou inferno. O cristão protestante-reformado tem a firme convicção de sua salvação (conforme doutrina da perseverança dos santos). Essa é a razão pela qual enfrenta serenamente o luto e a idéia de sua própria morte. Although the expectative common of the Christian church is the resurrection ofthe dead for the {{absolute}} redemption {{of those who}} have faith in Christ, among the catholic-roman and protestant-reformed groups there is divergence about what happens during the intermediate state. The catholic-roman has the faith in the doctrine of the purgatory and interception for the dead reason for the which pray for Mary, Jesus <b>Christ</b> mother <b>s,</b> to intercede in the hour of the death and surrenders himself to St. Joseph, the patron of the good death; he participles of the Sacrament of Eucharist, gives alms, practices mercy works, makes prayers and offers suffrage in benefit of the souls of the purgatory; he prays for souls of the dead saints intercede to him before God; he praises to the virgin Mary as the first, among the redeemed, to be resurrected among the dead s; and he practices good works to attenuate his situation in the day of the final judgment (in reason of believe that the salvation is reached by the faith in Christ and the good woks). The protestant-reformed believes that while the soul of the fair is enjoying of the communion with <b>Christ,</b> the heretic <b>s</b> soul is suffering faraway from Christ. That situation is temporary, because both wait for the resurrection of the dead and the final judgment in order to the fair can to enjoy of the salvation integrally (in the body and in the soul) and heretic can to receive the fair judgment integrally (in the body and in the soul) reason for the which doesn t intercede for the dead s (not even has the habit of visiting the graves) and nor asks for the dead saint s intercession; he doesn t practice good works with views the salvation (not even look for occasion for the good works); he doesn t practice the extreme unction (but evangelizes the dying in the bed of death); and he maintains a polarized vision of the status powder-death: heaven or hell. The protestant-reformed Christian has the firm conviction of his salvation (according to doctrine of the saint s perseverance). That is the reason for which calmly faces the mourning and the idea of his own death...|$|R

The purpose of the Senior Teacher classification is to 2 ̆ 7 enhance career opportunities for teachers and to recognise the professionalism of experienced practising teachers and their engagement in continuous professional learning. It supports the retention of competent, experienced teachers in duties associated with classroom teaching and promotes quality teaching that articulates with high teaching standards 2 ̆ 7.

That is one reason why the author decided, early in 2007, to apply for the Senior Teacher II classification, having held Senior Teacher I standing for six years. She wanted to demonstrate how she operates as an agent of change in the teaching of English at Christ Church Grammar School. To demonstrate this, she developed a Senior Teacher portfolio as a web site, which has become a resource for teachers, and also captures the author 2 ̆ 7 s experiences and reflections on learning technological strategies, implementing them within her teaching practice, passing on the skill to students and assessing the outcomes of such innovation within the English curricula of Years 8 to 10.
