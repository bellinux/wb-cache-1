25|$|The Court <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> plenary session, as a Grand Chamber {{of fifteen}} judges (including the {{president}} and vice-president), or in chambers of three or five judges. Plenary sittings are now very rare, and the court mostly sits in chambers of three or five judges. Each chamber elects its own president who is elected for a term of {{three years in the}} case of the five-judge chambers or one year in the case of three-judge chambers.|$|E
25|$|The {{storage of}} pasta {{depends on how}} far along it is processed. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> the {{cupboard}} for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored {{in the refrigerator for}} a maximum of five days in an airtight container. Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. If the cooked pasta is not used in the five days it may be frozen for up to two or three months. The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.|$|E
2500|$|Also in Sister Outsider is [...] "The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action.*" [...] Lorde {{discusses}} {{the importance of}} speaking, even when afraid because one's silence will not protect them from being marginalized and oppressed. [...] Many people fear {{to speak the truth}} because of how it may cause pain, however, one ought to put fear into perspective when deliberating whether to speak or not. [...] Lorde emphasizes that [...] "the transformation of silence into language and action is a self-revelation, and that always seems fraught with danger." [...] People are afraid of others' reactions for speaking, but mostly for demanding visibility, which is essential to live. [...] Lorde adds, [...] "We <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> our corners mute forever while our sisters and ourselves are wasted, while our children are distorted and destroyed, while our earth is poisoned; we <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> our safe corners mute as bottles, and we will still be no less afraid." [...] People are taught to respect their fear of speaking more than silence, but ultimately, the silence will choke us anyway, so we might as well speak the truth.|$|E

2500|$|Atzmon's {{works have}} also {{explored}} {{the music of}} the Middle East, North Africa, and Eastern Europe. Atzmon told The Guardian that he draws on Arabic music which he says cannot be notated like western music but must be internalised, which he calls [...] "reverting to the primacy of the ear". Atzmon's musical method has been to play with notions of cultural identity, flirting with genres such as tango and klezmer as well as various Arabic, Balkan, Gypsy and Ladino folk forms. Atzmon's recordings deliberately differ from his live shows. [...] "I don't think that anyone <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> a house, at home, and listen to me play a full-on bebop solo. It's too intense. My albums need to be less manic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hawtrey {{spent most}} of his life living with his mother, who {{suffered}} senile dementia in later years. Another anecdote recounted by Williams describes how during the filming of Carry On Teacher Joan Sims cried out to Hawtrey that his mother's handbag had caught fire after her cigarette ash fell into it. Without batting an eyelid, Hawtrey poured a cup of tea into the bag to put out the flames, snapped the handbag shut and continued with his story. Williams also recounted his gathering up of the sandwiches left over from a buffet for the Carry On cast. Williams was envious of Hawtrey's easier acceptance of his sexuality: [...] "He <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> a bar and pick up sailors and have a wonderful time. I couldn't do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|House {{pictures}} were released on June 27, 2007. The house has an Alice in Wonderland theme and contains an over sized bedroom {{and a small}} bedroom. The small bedroom features a very small doorway and five beds which are only five feet long, while the over sized bedroom features shoulder-height beds and enormous drawers which need a ladder to reach. A third bedroom is decorated all in red, and two large, round beds sit {{in the center of}} the room. The walkway to the Head of Household room is a modernist inspired enchanted forest. The living room features several colored mirrors, varying in shape and size. The living room is connected to the kitchen, which is connected to the HoH stairway and a hallway. There is one door in the hallway, which features a gym available to the HouseGuests. The hallway then leads to the bathroom, which features a lavish blue wall, and a shower which features a lion-shaped water spout. The backyard contains animal-shaped topiaries, flowers, a swimming pool, and a spinning teacup, which the HouseGuests <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in.</b> As revealed during the [...] "Majority Rules" [...] competition, the teacup holds nine gallons of water, which the HouseGuests place their feet in. Workout equipment can also be found outside. There are also multiple lawn chairs that the HouseGuests may use to lay out in the sun. There is also a large couch under a roof by the sliding glass door that the HouseGuests may use in case of rain.|$|E
