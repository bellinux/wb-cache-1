C. A. § 12 - 3 - 1003 was amended last year to authorize counties to purchase used or secondhand goods, equipment, materials, supplies, or commodities from private individuals and entities without public advertisement and competitive bidding as long as the county documents the general range of value of the item through a listing in a nationally-recognized publication, or through an appraisal by a licensed appraiser. The price paid must be within 10 % of the documented range. From <b>Governmental</b> <b>Entities</b> – Under T. C. A. § 12 - 3 - 1005, counties are authorized to purchase, trade, or receive as a gift any used or surplus personal property from another <b>governmental</b> <b>entity</b> without public advertisement and competitive bidding, upon approval of the governing bodies of each <b>governmental</b> <b>entity</b> involved in the transaction. <b>Governmental</b> <b>entities</b> include counties, cities, metropolitan governments, state government, federal government, and any instrumentality of the foregoing. (This law also authorizes counties to establish procedures for disposing of their surplus personal property to another <b>governmental</b> <b>entity</b> by sale, gift, trade, or barter upon any terms and conditions the governing body may authorize, without regard to any other laws governing the disposition of surplus property.) We are often asked whether a county may obtain used goods or equipment without going through a competitive bidding process. The answer is yes. The procedures that must be followed depend on whether the property is being obtained from a private individual or entity, or from another <b>governmental</b> <b>entity.</b> The two statutes discussed below apply in all counties regardless of any other purchasing laws the county may be under.
