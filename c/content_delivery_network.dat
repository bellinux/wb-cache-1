With p2p-streaming, movies are not streamed from a central server or <b>content</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>network</b> (CDN), but from other users who have {{parts of the}} movie on their units after seeing the movie earlier. This process begins when a user clicks play for a movie and continues throughout the viewing time, allowing for seamless viewing. After the viewer has completed watching the video, parts of the video file remains for a time on the user's device. Popular content, that is watched by many other users, remain longer on any one user's device than less popular content, which more quickly {{is removed from the}} network nodes.|$|E
25|$|After {{the success}} of New Super Mario Bros., {{consumers}} and publishers have shown renewed interest in 2D platformers, which can be attributed both to handheld consoles such as the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable, and low-risk downloadable services offered by WiiWare, Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and Steam. These range from classic revivals such as , Contra ReBirth, and , to original titles like Splosion Man and Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure. , released in 2008, was a platformer that featured completely two-dimensional graphics and a rich visual style. Subsequent games such as Braid, A Boy and His Blob, and The Behemoth's BattleBlock Theater also use completely 2D graphics. New Super Mario Bros. Wii is particularly notable, as unlike the majority of 2D platformers in the 21st century, it was a direct release for a non-portable console, and not restricted on a <b>content</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>network.</b> The success of New Super Mario Bros. Wii led to Nintendo releasing similar 2D platformer games for their classic franchises the following year: Donkey Kong Country Returns and Kirby's Return to Dream Land.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- The {{world of}} {{broadcasting}} is changing rapidly to accommodate new viewer habits and <b>Content</b> <b>Delivery</b> <b>Networks</b> {{are a key}} part of this new model. Advanced technologies are required {{to keep up with the}} increasing demand across heterogeneous CDN networks. This discussion will offer a comprehensive look at how geo-dispersed object-based storage provides metadata driven intelligence to enable more robust CDNs. New technologies in object storage that leverage intelligent metadata for aware content placement from the origin to the edge, and that make use of subscriber analytics and software-defined networking, can provide the future architecture to help <b>content</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>networks</b> become autonomic, self-adapting and self-healing.
