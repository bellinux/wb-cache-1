Brown {{departed}} on 29 September 1942 to steam down the Chesapeake Bay to Norfolk, Virginia, where she underwent degaussing and deperming to make her less likely to trigger magnetic sea mines. Departing Norfolk, she proceeded back north through the Chesapeake Bay, anchored off Annapolis, Maryland, overnight on 3–4 October 1942, and then passed through the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal and Delaware River to Delaware Bay, where she joined a convoy of four merchant ships. Escorted by three escort vessels and a United States Navy blimp, the convoy proceeded up the coast of New Jersey to New York City, where on 6 October 1942 John W. Brown began loading her first cargo [...] 8,380.9 long tons (9,386.6 short tons; 8,515.0 metric tons) of cargo destined for the Soviet Union, consisting of two Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighters, 10 M4 Sherman tanks, 200 motorcycles, 100 jeeps, over 700 long tons (784 short tons, 711 metric tons) of ammunition, and over 250 long tons (280 short tons, 254 metric tons) of <b>canned</b> <b>pork</b> lunch meat [...] at Pier 17 in Brooklyn. While in New York, she also had the Oerlikon 20 mm cannon mounted on her bow replaced by a 3-inch (76.2-mm) 50-caliber gun, and she interrupted her loading of cargo on 9 October 1942 for work on the degaussing and compass adjusting ranges.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the time}} and place of the dish's {{invention}} is unclear, American <b>canned</b> <b>pork</b> and beans was well established in the American diet by the mid-19th century. The 1832 cookbook The American Frugal Housewife lists only three ingredients for this dish: a quart of beans, a pound of salt pork, and pepper. According to the 1975 Better Homes and Garden Heritage Cookbook, <b>canned</b> <b>pork</b> and beans was the first convenience food.|$|E

5000|$|After a {{year and}} a half of production, <b>Can</b> of <b>Pork</b> was finally {{released}} on two 12-inch records and one CD in April 1992 through Lookout Records (LK 44).

It received mostly positive reviews from critics, with Allmusic rating the compilation 2 and a half out of 5 stars. Since its release, <b>Can</b> of <b>Pork</b> has been regarded by Lookout Records itself and fans as a highly important compilation album (the CD version features [...] "An important compilational chapter of P-rock history" [...] printed on the spine) and has been cited as one of the greatest punk rock compilations of all time.|$|R

50|$|The {{recipe is}} known in several {{variants}} depending, among other things, on the local availability of certain ingredients. While everybody seems to agree {{about the use of}} guanciale and tomato, onion is not favored in Amatrice, but is shown in the classical handbooks of Roman cuisine.

50|$|The {{recipe for}} American commercially <b>canned</b> <b>pork</b> and beans varies {{slightly}} from company to company, but generally consists of rehydrated navy beans packed {{in tomato sauce}} (usually made from concentrate and which may incorporate starch, sugar, salt, and seasoning), with small chunks of salted pork or rendered pork fat. The ingredients are cooked, packed into hermetically sealed containers, and processed by heat to assure preservation.|$|E

5000|$|After the war, {{there were}} {{attempts}} {{to improve the}} ration based on input from the field. In 1922, the ration was reorganized to consist of 16 oz of meat (usually beef jerky), 3 oz of canned corned beef or chocolate, 14 oz of hard bread or hardtack biscuits, coffee and sugar. In 1925, the meat ration was replaced with <b>canned</b> <b>pork</b> and beans. In 1936, there was an attempt at variety by having an [...] "A"-menu of corned beef and a [...] "B"-menu of pork and beans. This was cancelled upon introduction of the new Field Ration, Type C, in 1938.|$|E
50|$|Once {{they finally}} reached the 2 forts at Bayan and Pandapatan, the number of {{effective}} guns had dropped to 600 and they had lost their Maguindanao cargadores {{and replaced them with}} an additional 40 pack mules, 80 in total. When they got to know that the beans in cans had a mix of pork in it, the bearers refused to carry the American rations of <b>canned</b> <b>pork</b> and beans. The American force reached the lake after a trek of seventeen days over thirty-two miles. Establishing a camp two miles from Bayan on 1 May, Baldwin sent an ultimatum to the Sultan asking for the surrender of the murderers of his soldiers.|$|E
5000|$|The reserve ration {{was first}} issued {{during the latter}} part of World War I to feed troops who were away from a {{garrison}} or field kitchen. It originally consisted of 12 ounces of fresh bacon or one pound of canned meat known as the Meat Ration—usually, corned beef. Additionally, two 8-ounce cans of hard bread or hardtack biscuits, a packet of 1.16 ounces of pre-ground coffee, a packet of 2.4 ounces of granulated sugar, and a packet of 0.16 ounces of salt were issued. There was also a separate [...] "tobacco ration" [...] of 0.4 ounces of tobacco and 10 cigarette rolling papers, later replaced by brand-name machine-rolled cigarettes. After the war, there were attempts to improve the ration based on input from the field. In 1922, the Meat Ration was revised, consisting of one pound of meat (usually a combination of dried beef and canned corned beef). This was supplemented by hard chocolate, 14 ounces of hard bread or hardtack biscuits, coffee, and sugar. In 1925, the Meat Ration was changed, deleting the dried beef in favor of <b>canned</b> <b>pork</b> and beans, and reducing the bread component. The corned beef allowance was also reduced in size (older rations continued to be issued, however). In 1936, menu planners attempted to introduce more variety by developing an alternate Meat Ration consisting of an [...] "A"-menu (canned corned beef) and a [...] "B"-menu (<b>canned</b> <b>pork</b> & beans). The A & B Reserve or combat ration was canceled after being superseded in 1938 by the Field Ration, Type C.|$|E

40|$|Slaughtering hogs and curing {{the meat}} {{on the farm}} is a common {{practice}} which makes available a palatable and nutritious food. It utilizes labor at a season {{of the year when}} usually there is no great rush of work. As a general rule, farm slaughter is not to be recommended until cold weather is a certainty, for warm weather is apt to cause heavy spoilage. Meat is a highly perishable food product, therefore absolute cleanliness should prevail in its handling. Contamination of meat by soiled hands, clothing, tools, or containers is not only insanitary but actually lowers the keeping quality of the meat. This extension circular of 1925 covers the selection of the animal; equipment needed; slaughtering; the following techniques of scalding, dressing, carcass care, cutting, curing, rendering, sausage making, <b>canning</b> <b>pork,</b> and soap making; laws and regulations; and recipes using the different pork cuts...|$|R

5000|$|In August 1990, Lookout Records owner/co-founder Larry Livermore and Chris Applecore, {{founder of}} the Puddle fanzine, had {{decided to make a}} {{compilation}} album of various artists. Applecore contacted groups such as The Offspring, Cringer and Jawbreaker in October 1990, asking them if they wanted to record a song for a compilation album, all of which declined the offer. In December, Livermore met Pat Hynes, a U.C. student, artist and founder/publisher of the fanzine 2+2=5, and hired him to work for Lookout and asked him to get involved with the production of <b>Can</b> of <b>Pork.</b> [...] The two then contacted bands such as The Wynona Riders, Fifteen and The Mr. T Experience in February 1991 [...] and asked them to record songs for the upcoming compilation, all of which accepted. A deadline was set for April, which was eventually changed a number of times for 11 months. Livermore, Hynes and Applecore came up with working titles for the compilation such as The Thing That Ate David (a reference to the previous Lookout compilation The Thing That Ate Floyd (1989)), Lookout Avenue and This Is Why We Are the Smart Punx, all of which they decided they were not satisfied with. In June, the three found out that David Hayes, owner of contemporary punk label Very Small Records, was to be releasing a double compilation that year titled Very Small World. Because of this, they debated canceling the project, but ultimately decided to continue working on it. From December 1991 to February 1992, Livermore was in England and left the production of the compilation to Hynes and Applecore. The same month, Hynes and Applecore contacted the bands they decided on and went to record the compilation with Andy Ernst and Kevin Army at Art of Ears Studios in San Francisco. After the recording process was finished, they finally settled on the title <b>Can</b> of <b>Pork</b> and Hynes began drawing the cover art. <b>Can</b> of <b>Pork</b> was mastered by John Golden at K-Disc in Hollywood.|$|R
