500|$|After {{returning}} to England in May 1968, Lennon suggested that Cynthia take a holiday in Greece with Mardas, Donovan, Boyd, and her sister. Lennon {{said that he}} would be very busy recording what would become The White Album and that it would do her some good to take a break with Mardas, his girlfriend Jenny Boyd, and others. Cynthia arrived home one day early from Greece on 22 May 1968. She and Mardas discovered Lennon and Ono sitting <b>cross-legged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, staring into each other's eyes, and found Ono's slippers outside the Lennons' marital bedroom door. Cynthia asked Boyd and Mardas if she could spend the night at their apartment. At the apartment Boyd went straight to bed, but Mardas got Cynthia drunk and tried to convince her that they should both run away together. After Cynthia had vomited in the bathroom she collapsed on a bed in the spare bedroom, but Mardas joined her and tried to kiss her until she (in her words) [...] "pushed him away". Brian Epstein's personal assistant, Peter Brown, maintains that Cynthia did sleep with Mardas, saying: [...] "She knew it was a mistake the moment it happened, especially with Alex , whom she had never trusted, nor even liked".|$|E
500|$|During {{the flight}} back to England, Lennon got very drunk on Scotch and confessed {{that he had been}} {{involved}} with other women during their marriage. He went on to detail his liaisons with groupies, friends (such as Joan Baez, actress Eleanor Bron, journalist Cleave) and [...] "thousands" [...] of women around the globe. Although not wanting to hear Lennon's confession, she knew women were attracted to him, [...] "like moths to a flame". Two weeks later, in May 1968, Lennon suggested Cynthia take a holiday in Greece with Mardas, Donovan, and two friends, as he would be very busy recording songs for what would become The White Album. She arrived back at Kenwood from Greece earlier than expected, at 4 o'clock on 22 May 1968, to discover Lennon and Ono sitting <b>cross-legged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor in matching white robes, staring into each other's eyes, and then found Ono's slippers outside the Lennons' bedroom door. Shocked, she asked Jenny Boyd and Mardas if she could spend the night at their apartment. At the apartment Boyd went straight to bed, but she and Mardas drank more alcohol, with Mardas trying to convince her to run away together. After she had vomited in the bathroom, she collapsed on a bed in the spare bedroom, with Mardas joining her and trying to kiss her until she pushed him away.|$|E

25|$|Indo-Scythian coins {{essentially}} {{continue the}} Indo-Greek tradition, by using <b>the</b> Greek language <b>on</b> <b>the</b> obverse and <b>the</b> Kharoshthi language <b>on</b> <b>the</b> reverse. The {{portrait of the}} king is never shown however, and is replaced by depictions of <b>the</b> king <b>on</b> horse (and sometimes on camel), or sometimes sitting <b>cross-legged</b> <b>on</b> a cushion. <b>The</b> reverse of their coins typically show Greek divinities.|$|R
50|$|Those {{gathered}} at a formal gathering or fono are always seated <b>cross-legged</b> <b>on</b> mats <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, around the fale, {{facing each other}} with an open space in the middle. The interior directions of a fale, east, west, north and south, {{as well as the}} positions of the posts, affect the seating positions of chiefs according to rank, the place where orators (host or visiting party) must stand to speak or {{the side of the house}} where guests and visitors enter and are seated. The space also defines the position where the 'ava makers (aumaga) in the Samoa 'ava ceremony are seated and the open area for the presentation and exchanging of cultural items such as the 'ie toga fine mats.|$|R
500|$|In 1968, Cynthia went on {{vacation}} to Greece, leaving Lennon at Kenwood with Shotton. After {{several days of}} taking LSD and smoking marijuana, Lennon convened {{a meeting at the}} Beatles' business HQ to inform the others that he felt he was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ. Later that day he phoned Ono, whose own husband Tony (Anthony Cox) was in Paris on business, and invited her to Kenwood. Shotton left the two alone, whereupon Lennon invited Ono (who had also taken LSD) up to the attic to hear his largely experimental non-Beatles' recordings. For the rest of the night, the two collaborated on what became the [...] album, and then [...] "made love at dawn", according to Lennon. Cynthia returned early from her vacation, and discovered Lennon and Ono sitting <b>cross-legged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor and staring intently into each other's eyes (Ono was wearing one of Cynthia's bathrobes). In a state of shock, Cynthia then left to stay with friends for a few days, although Lennon and Cynthia were reconciled for a time upon her return to Kenwood. It was during Cynthia's next holiday in Italy that Lennon and Ono finally entered into a permanent relationship, and Lennon asked for a divorce. Cynthia, together with Julian and her mother, moved back into Kenwood for the summer, where Paul McCartney visited her to offer his support. On the journey to Kenwood he composed the song [...] "Hey Jude", which eventually became The Beatles' biggest selling single. Lennon and Ono, meanwhile, were without a permanent address for a time. They stayed with McCartney at his house in Cavendish Avenue (where it is alleged that a further breach occurred in the Lennonâ€“McCartney relationship when Lennon discovered a derogatory note written by McCartney) and with Peter Brown and then Neil Aspinall, before moving into an apartment leased by Starr at 34 Montagu Square, Marylebone in London. They were evicted from this flat by the owner following a raid by the drug squad on 18 October 1968, and subsequent November trial, and so moved back into Kenwood for a short time, which had been vacated by Cynthia. In the new year Ono and Lennon moved into the Dorchester Hotel in London, leaving Kenwood for the last time.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the {{ceremony}} {{takes place in a}} circular pattern with everyone seated <b>cross-legged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, or on the ground if it takes place outside in an open ceremonial area (malae). At all formal gatherings of chiefs and orators there are defined positions in the houses where each shall sit. The middle posts/termed matua Tala are reserved for the leading chiefs and the side posts on the front section termed Pou o le pepe are occupied by the orators chiefs. The posts {{at the back of the}} house talatua indicate the positions maintained by the 'ava makers and assistants. Architecture of Samoa define spatial areas where the front is that part facing or closest to the main road or thoroughfare in a village, while the back is the part of the house farthest removed from road. [...] If the 'Ava ceremony takes place outside in the open space of the village commons (malae), the same seating position is kept in relation to the roadway (or the space considered the front of the village).|$|E

6000|$|After regaining {{his room}} last night nothing had struck him more {{forcibly}} than the needlessness of his words: [...] "Don't cry, Nollie!" [...] {{for he had}} realised with uneasiness {{that she had not}} been near crying. No; there was in her some emotion very different from the tearful. He kept seeing her <b>cross-legged</b> figure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bed in that dim light; tense, enigmatic, almost Chinese; kept feeling the feverish touch of her lips. A good girlish burst of tears would have done her good, and been a guarantee. He had the uncomfortable conviction that his refusal had passed her by, as if unspoken. And, since he could not go and make music at that time of night, he had ended on his knees, in a long search for guidance, which was not vouchsafed him.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} erect sitting, slouched posture with cross-legged sitting, and erect posture with <b>cross-legged</b> sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lumbar and pelvic angles, and gluteal pressure. [Subjects] For the ex-periments, 17 healthy women were recruited. [Methods] All {{subjects were asked to}} perform three sitting postures: erect sitting, slouched posture with cross-legged sitting, and erect posture with cross-legged sitting. Lumbar and pelvic angles were measured using a three-dimensional motion-capture system, and gluteal pressure was measured using a pressure mat. [Results] Compared to erector sitting, slouched posture with cross-legged sitting showed significantly greater lumbar flexion, posterior pelvic tilt, and left pelvic tilt. Compared to erect sitting, erect posture with cross-legged sitting showed significantly greater lumbar flexion and posterior pelvic tilt. Compared to erect posture with cross-legged sitting, slouched posture with cross-legged sitting showed significantly greater lumbar flexion and posterior pelvic tilt. Compared to erect sitting and erect posture with cross-legged sitting, slouched pos-ture with cross-legged sitting showed significantly greater left gluteal pressure; {{there was no significant difference}} in right gluteal pressure. [Conclusion] An erect posture can reduce changes in lumbar and pelvic angles, and gluteal pressure compared to a slouched posture during cross-legged sitting...|$|R
