Pival studied the vocabulary, syntax, and other stylistic characteristics of the letter and concluded that it more closely resembled Lincoln's style of writing than Hay's.

5|$|The {{evidence}} for an ancestral world of RNA cells and <b>computer</b> <b>analysis</b> of viral and host DNA sequences are giving {{a better understanding}} of the evolutionary relationships between different viruses and may help identify the ancestors of modern viruses. To date, such analyses have not proved which of these hypotheses is correct. However, it seems unlikely that all currently known viruses have a common ancestor, and viruses have probably arisen numerous times in the past by one or more mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth in}} {{computer}} crime during the 1980s and 1990s caused {{law enforcement agencies}} to begin establishing specialized groups, usually at the national level, to handle {{the technical aspects of}} investigations. For example, in 1984 the FBI launched a <b>Computer</b> <b>Analysis</b> and Response Team and the following year a computer crime department was set up within the British Metropolitan Police fraud squad. As well as being law enforcement professionals, many of the early members of these groups were also computer hobbyists and became responsible for the field's initial research and direction.|$|E

25|$|A 2008 <b>computer</b> <b>analysis</b> of the Book of Mormon text {{supports}} this theory, although the study {{does not include}} Joseph Smith in the author sample {{on the ground that}} few pure examples of Smith's writings are extant. Several other significant problems are apparent in the methodology of this <b>computer</b> <b>analysis,</b> specifically the use of closed set methodology instead of open set methodology. For example, the original methodology, when replicated, also assigns Rigdon as the probable author of The Federalist Papers, which were written five years before his birth. Critics of the Spalding–Rigdon theory point out that there is no record of any meeting between Rigdon and Smith until December 1830, nearly a year after the Book of Mormon was published.|$|E

25|$|Backgammon has an {{established}} opening theory, {{although it is}} less detailed than that of chess.
