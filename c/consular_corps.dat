25|$|Sharaf's {{impact and}} legacy was varied: as {{director}} of the powerful Diplomatic and <b>Consular</b> <b>Corps</b> department at the MFA (1973 – 1974), he was pivotal in establishing a more egalitarian recruitment system, based on meritocracy, emphasizing the need for Egyptian diplomatic and <b>consular</b> <b>corps</b> officers to be committed, multi-disciplined, cultured, socially refined, with proven linguistic abilities, and an aptitude for foreign travel. Later, {{as director of}} the Asian department, he managed to develop a small following of diplomats and entice them to specialize in Asian affairs, especially China.|$|E

25|$|As {{evident from}} {{photographs}} taken {{at various stages}} in his life, Sharaf was obese, but light on his feet in spite of it, only losing substantial weight {{towards the end of}} his life as an indirect result of advanced diabetes. He was a chain smoker till well into his mid-fifties, and was regarded by many as a sanguine, gregarious, and happy-go-lucky person. He valued his family and often took them along on his various travels. He was a moderate person, with few enemies compared to some members of his family clan. Sharaf had no conflict furthering Egypt's interests including those with Israel by maintaining cordial and polite relations with his Israeli Counterpart in Stockholm, ambassador Mordecay Kidron, who also happened to be his next door neighbor. He also chose, out of the available pictures at his disposal, to have printed in a local Cairo monthly magazine a photograph taken of him welcoming, as doyen of the <b>consular</b> <b>corps,</b> Pope Paul VI to Hong Kong at Kai Tak International Airport in December 1970, reflecting his sense of religious tolerance as a Muslim.|$|E
2500|$|Consular Corps: CC-000 to CC-999. These plates used {{to appear}} {{identical}} to regular standard issue plates, except Victoria – Garden State or Victoria – On the Move {{was replaced with}} Vic – <b>Consular</b> <b>Corps.</b> In 2000, they were redesigned—the plate has the same dimensions as regular plates, but has the rego number in the font used for slimline plates. The legend [...] "Consular Corps" [...] appears at the top, while the legend [...] "Victoria" [...] appears at the bottom.

Character embossed reverted to the full style used in the Garden State and On the Move era.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the month}} of May 1926 a coup d'état {{replaced}} the republic in Portugal with a military dictatorship, a regime that according to Sousa Mendes [...] "had been greeted with delight" [...] in Portugal. He supported the new regime at first and his career prospects improved. In {{the month of}} March 1927 Sousa Mendes was assigned {{to serve as the}} Consul in Vigo in Spain, where he helped the new regime neutralize Oppositionists. He was then sent to Antwerp, Belgium in 1929 to serve as Dean of the <b>Consular</b> <b>Corps.</b> The year of 1934 was a tragic year for the Sousa Mendes family with the loss of two of its children, Raquel barely one year old, and Manuel who had just graduated from the University of Louvain. In Antwerp Sousa Mendes was disciplined for tardiness in the transferring of funds {{to the head of the}} Foreign Office. He was assigned in the year of 1938 to the post of Consul-General of Bordeaux, France, with jurisdiction over the whole of the southwest of France.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, Sharaf {{assumed the}} {{position}} of Doyen of the <b>Consular</b> <b>Corps</b> in Hong Kong. The position of Doyen would bring Sharaf closer and into regular contact with the Governor General of the colony. At the time, the Governor General of Hong Kong was Sir David Trench (1915 – 1988, and in office from 1964 – 1971), {{a veteran of the}} British colonial service. The position of Doyen would also bring Sharaf and his wife Noha closer to the-then director of protocol in Hong Kong, Brigadier Sir Rainald Lewthwaite OBE (1913 – 2003), aka Ray Lewthwaite, and his American-born wife Margaret Edmonds Lewthwaite (MBE) (1907 – 1990), aka Peggy Lewthwaite. [...] Ray Lewthwaite, a former British officer who had served in Egypt and North Africa during World War II, and his wife Margaret would be lifelong friends of the Sharaf's, being house guests at their Beijing embassy residence in the Eighties. The Sharafs were particularly impressed with Margaret, who, besides being a diplomatic hostess, was an accomplished author and painter.|$|E
2500|$|The new Empire {{provided}} rich {{new opportunities}} {{at the top}} for the nobility of Prussia, and the other states, to fill. They dominated the diplomatic service, the Army, and the civil service. Through their control of the civil service, the aristocracy had a dominant voice in decisions affecting the universities and the churches. In 1914, Germany's diplomats consisted of eight princes 29 counts 20 barons 54 other nobles, and a mere 11 commoners. The commoners were chiefly the sons of leading industrialists or bankers. Almost all the diplomats had been socialized into the feudal student corps at the universities. The <b>consular</b> <b>corps</b> comprised commoners, but they had little decision-making ability. Since the days of Frederick the great, it had been difficult for commoners to achieve high ranking the Army. It was considered a suitable role for young aristocrats. The new Constitution put Military affairs under the direct control of the Emperor, and largely {{out of reach of}} the Reichstag. With its large corps of reserve officers across Germany, the military strengthened its role as [...] "The estate which upheld the nation." [...] Historian Hans-Ulrich Wehler says, [...] "it became an almost separate, self-perpetuating caste." ...|$|E
