Felix and Beth-as-Sarah take a medical swab from Kira but are caught by Mrs. S who bans [...] "Sarah" [...] from seeing Kira. Alison is forced to harbor Sarah in her craft room; Donnie sees Sarah but doesn't notice the difference, furthering Alison's suspicions. MK further researches the bots, telling Beth of the <b>clone</b> <b>killer</b> Ferdinand. Beth theorizes he and Rachel are lovers; MK wonders if Ferdinand would come running for Rachel. Beth begins snorting the cocaine. Katja arrives the next day and is spotted by Vic who thinks she is Sarah and demands the cocaine. Katja flees and is picked up by Beth, who hits Vic with her car.

One was directed to HLA-A 2; H-Y and the other to HLA-B 7; H-Y. These results can be interpreted {{in the context of the}} altered self hypothesis.

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that T cell clones can mediate multiple biologic activities (1). Inducer T cell clones, for example, may stimulate immunoglobulin (Ig) secretion ~md activate mast cell and T cell proliferation (1, 2). Similarly, we found (3) that <b>clones</b> with natural <b>killer</b> cell activity can also mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Because these clones lysed syngeneic B lymphocytes, we {{considered the possibility}} that this cell might {{be involved in the}} regulation of Ig secretion. We test this hypothesis in this report. We show that the antibody responses of T plus B lymphocytes containing < 1 % <b>cloned</b> natural <b>killer</b> (NK) cells are severely impaired, and the primary cellular target of suppression is the B cell. We suggest that some NK cells may regulate Ig secretion through the recognition of marker molecules expressed on the surface of activated B lymphocytes not linked to the major histocompatibility complex.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the cytotoxic mechanism of human killer T cells at the clonal level against autologous tumor cells, we attempted to obtain the long-term cultured <b>killer</b> T cell <b>clones</b> with the specific cytotoxic activity in two metastatic pleural effusions from breast cancers (HMC- 1 and HMC- 2) and one peritoneal effusion from a pancreatic cancer (HPC- 3). At initiation of the culture, pleural exudate lymphocytes (PLEL) already demonstrated a high cytotoxicity against HMC- 1 targets, but not against autologous fibroblasts and K- 562. PLEL showed phenotypically OKT 3 and 8 positive. However, these PLEL cultured with recombinant Interleukin 2 (rIL- 2) and stimulated by autologous mixed lymphocyte-tumor culture (MLTC) showed a relatively high cytotoxicity against some allogeneic tumor targets. By cloning both effector T cells and HMC- 1 targets, a highly specific pair of TcHMH- 1 <b>killer</b> <b>clone</b> and HMC- 1 - 8 target clone was successfully selected. PLEL from HMC- 2 showed cytotoxicity against HMC- 2 targets as well as K- 562. T <b>killer</b> <b>clones</b> from these PLEL also showed dual cytotoxicity at the clonal level. Peritoneal exudate lymphocytes (FEL) from HPC- 3 indicated an increased potential of NK activity during in vitro cultivation. However, PEL were unsuccessful in selecting the <b>killer</b> <b>clones</b> from HPC- 3 case possibly due to the reduced responsiveness to rIL- 2. The effector mechanism against autologous tumor cells was tested using a specific pair of TcHMC- 1 and HMC- 1 - 8. The cytotoxicity of TcHMC- 1 was inhibited {{by the addition of}} OKT 3 or 8 monoclonal antibodies in the cytotoxic assays. This inhibition was recovered by the addition of Con A, suggesting that these antibodies could inhibit at the recognition phase of TcHMC- 1 to autologous tumor cells but not at the functional phase. With respect to the cytotoxic effect of TcHMC- 1 against HMC- 1 - 8 in vivo, we carried out a Winn assay using nude mice. Subcutaneous injections of TcHMC- 1 and HMC- 1 - 8 clearly resulted in a failure of tumor development even at 12 weeks after injections. Mice injected with HMC- 1 - 8 and allogeneic T lymphocytes cultured with rIL- 2 developed tumors. Currently, TcHMC- 1 continues to grow in vivo over a one year period with the presence of rIL- 2 and with the stimulation of autologous MLTC. This highly specific T <b>killer</b> <b>clone</b> could be very useful for the investigations of specific destruction of autologous tumor cells by T killer cells...|$|R

The numbers of obtained clones from LAk and TIL were 34 and 78, respectively. The killer activity of these clones was examined against autologous tumor cells and Daudi cells as targets. About {{half of the}} PBL and TIL clones showed significant cytotoxicity against autologous tumor and/or Daudi cells. It was noteworthy that the specific cytotoxicity against autologous tumor cells (CTL-Like activity) was observed in 9 of 14 LAK <b>killer</b> <b>clones</b> and in 30 of 41 TIL <b>killer</b> <b>clones.</b> Surface marker analysis indicated that all the CTL-like clones were either CD 3 ? 4 ? 8 " or CD 3 ? 4 ? 8 ?, {{and there was no}} significant difference in cytotoxicity between them. On the other hand, about half of the LAK and TIL clones had no cytotoxic effect against Daudi and/or autologous tumor cells. On the CTL induction system, these non-killer clones also showed regulatory functions, such as augmentation and suppression. These results suggest that IL- 2 activated cells, both from peripheral blood and tumor tissue have not only a direct cytotoxic activity, but also an indirect helper function which was mediated by regulatory T cell...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cloned</b> T <b>killer</b> cells {{derived from}} one-way mixed {{lymphocyte}} reactions were characterized {{with regard to}} their Lyt phenotype and specificity. Two clones of Lyt- 1 - 2 + phenotype that recognized H- 2 Dd were selected and examined for their cytolytic function by negative staining and thin section electron microscopy. When incubated with the H- 2 d target S 194, they assemble two types of tubular complexes, polyperforin 1 and 2. Both structures appear to arise by polymerization of precursors that may originate in dense granules and/or Golgi of T killer cells. Polyperforins appear to be associated with vesicles that are released during the lytic reaction and transferred to target membranes as shown by immunoelectron microscopy. Since there is a close correlation between target lysis and the appearance of polyperforins on target membranes, it is suggested that polyperforins take part in the cell- mediated killing reaction. Although polyperforins are different in size and several molecular properties from complement, there are striking similarities between these circular complexes and polyperforin (C 9). It is therefore possible that they belong to a closely related family of cytolytic effector molecules...|$|R
40|$|In cell couples formed {{between a}} <b>cloned</b> murine natural <b>killer</b> (NK) cell and either of two target cells, we have {{obtained}} evidence by immunofluorescence observations for a rapid coordinate repositioning of two organelles, the microtubule organizing {{center and the}} perinuclear Golgi apparatus, inside the NK cell to face the region of contact with the target cell. With microtubule-disrupting drugs, which also cause a dispersion of the Golgi apparatus throughout {{the periphery of the}} NK cell, it was found that target cell lysis is reversibly inhibited. It is proposed that the coordinate repositioning of the two organelles serves the function of directing secretory vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus to the bound target cells, the secretory vesicles containing components that induce target cell lysis...|$|R

40|$|T-lymphocyte clones {{derived from}} populations {{sensitized}} to alloantigens in vitro were tested for their regulatory effects on pokeweed mitogen-stimulated immunoglobulin (Ig) secretion. <b>Clones</b> with natural <b>killer</b> (NK) -like cytotoxicity and/or suppressive activity for lymphoproliferative (LP) responses potently inhibited Ig secretion. Moreover, certain alloproliferative T 4 + interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) -secreting 'helper' clones shared this strong suppressive activity on Ig secretion. The remaining clones enhanced, rather than suppressed, Ig production. Inhibition by {{all types of}} suppressive clones appeared not to be restricted by MHC products, since allogeneic HLA-mismatched donors were suppressed as efficiently as the autologous donor. Suppression was radioresistant, and was apparently not caused by absorption of IL- 2, or cytotoxicity of the clones. Suppression was still detectable at plateau levels when cloned cells were added as late as 96 hr after the initiation of the cultures, suggesting an inhibitory mechanism divorced from early B-cell activation events. Thus, T-lymphocyte clones with distinct different functional activities share similar profound suppressive effects on Ig secretion in vitro...|$|R
40|$|The adoptive {{transfer}} of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) {{in conjunction with}} recombinant interleukin- 2 (rIL- 2) {{for the treatment of}} advanced cancer has recently been under intense investigation. Despite extensive research, the precise surface phenotype of TIL remains to be fully defined. To elucidate this unsolved problem, we established 11 TIL clones derived from rIL- 2 expanded TIL obtained from B 16 - F 10 murine melanoma tumors. These clones could be divided phenotypically into four groups: CD 8 (+) T-cell <b>clones,</b> natural <b>killer</b> (NK) -cell <b>clones,</b> NK-like CD 8 (+) T-cell clones, and double negative T-cell clones. Functionally, CD 8 (+) T-cell clones demonstrated specific cytotoxic activity against B 16 -F 10 melanoma cells, whereas NK-cell clones and double negative T-cell clones demonstrated only non-specific cytotoxic activity against NK-sensitive YAC- 1 cells. NK-like CD 8 (+) T-cell clones showed dual cytotoxic activity. Clones T 1 [a CD 8 (+) T-cell clone] and T 2 [an NK-like CD 8 (+) T-cell clone] which had cytotoxic activity against B 16 -F 10 melanoma cells, demonstrated a proliferative response against immunoblotted B 16 -F 10 melanoma antigens, whereas clones T 7 (an NK-cell clone) and T 10 (a double negative T-cell clone), which had no cytotoxic activity against B 16 -F 10 cells, demonstrated no proliferative response against them. Winn assays revealed that only the CD 8 (+) T-cell clone (T 1) had an antitumor effect in vivo, whereas the double negative T-cell clone (T 10) and NK-like CD 8 (+) T-cell clone (T 2) stimulated tumor growth in vivo. Adoptive immunotherapy using tumor-specific, highly cytotoxic TIL clones may represent a useful future immunotherapeutic option for the treatment of human tumors...|$|R
40|$|A cDNA clone {{encoding}} a human receptor for the Fc {{portion of}} IgG (Fc gamma R), Fc gamma RIII or CD 16, was isolated {{from a human}} leukocyte library by a transient expression-immunoselection procedure. This cDNA (pGP 5) encodes a 46 -kDa phosphatidylinositol-linked cell surface protein with CD 16 determinants and affinity for human IgG. The deduced protein sequence is most homologous to the murine receptor Fc gamma RII alpha, with slightly less homology to the human receptors Fc gamma RII and Fc epsilon RI. The cDNA hybridizes to a 2. 2 kilobase mRNA in human leukocytes and a <b>cloned</b> human natural <b>killer</b> cell line. Fc gamma RIII is mapped to chromosome 1 by spot-blot analysis of sorted human chromosomes.

40|$|A {{subset of}} human T cells has {{recently}} been described. These cells express the CD 3 complex {{but they do not}} carry the classical T-cell receptor (TCR) -alpha/-beta heterodimer on their surface (WT 31 - CD 3 +). Instead, they express a TCR-gamma chain associated with another type of polypeptide termed TCR-delta. We report here that a T-cell <b>clone</b> with natural <b>killer</b> (NK) -like activity, WM- 14, had a disulfide bridged TCR-gamma homodimer associated with CD 3 on its surface. The TCR-gamma chains of WM- 14 cells were present in three different glycosylation forms of 43, 40, and 38 kDa, but they appeared to contain the same polypeptide backbone. Since cytotoxicity by WM- 14 could be inhibited by anti-CD 3 antibodies, we concluded that the TCR-gamma-CD 3 complex was involved in the NK-like unrestricted killer activity. Although normal CD 3 -gamma, CD 3 -delta, and CD 3 -epsilon chains were present in this clone, the association with the TCR-gamma homodimer may be the cause of a complete processing of the N-linked oligosaccharides attached to the CD 3 -delta chai...|$|R
40|$|Cell lysis {{plays an}} {{important}} role in immune functions enabling the organism to eliminate unwanted indigenous or foreign cells. There are two pathways to accomplish this, one that makes use of humoral factors including complement components and the other utilizing cytolytic killer cells. The molecular mechanisms leading to complement lysis are fairly well understood. A series of reactions triggered by antibodydependent or independent pathways results in the formation of a membrane-bound C 5 convertase. Then enzymatic activation of C 5 initiates self-assembly and membrane insertion of the tetramolecular C 5 b- 8 complex, which in turn binds and polymerizes C 9. Finally, polymerization of 12 - 18 C 9 subunits leads to a tubular complex that, upon insertion into the target membrane, gives rise to membrane lesions and may create a transmembrane channel leading to cell death (1 - 3). Little is known about the molecular mechanisms of cell-mediated cytolysis (for reviews see references 4 - 8). Recently, however, Dourmashkin et al.

40|$|High-affinity binding was {{demonstrated}} between suppressor-T-cell-derived bioactive glycosylation-inhibiting factor (GIF) and helper T hybridomas and {{natural killer cell}} line cells. Inactive GIF present in cytosol of suppressor T cells and Escherichia coli-derived recombinant human GIF (rhGIF) failed to bind to these cells. However, affinity of rhGIF for the target cells was generated by replacement of Cys- 57 in the sequence with Ala or of Asn- 106 with Ser or binding of 5 -thio- 2 -nitrobenzoic acid to Cys- 60 in the molecule. Such mutations and the chemical modification of rhGIF synergistically increased the affinity of GIF molecules for the target cells. The results indicated that receptors on the target cells recognize conformational structures of bioactive GIF. Equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of the specific binding between bioactive rGIF derivatives and high-affinity receptors was 10 – 100 pM. Receptors for bioactive GIF derivatives were detected on Th 1 and Th 2 T helper <b>clones</b> and natural <b>killer</b> NK 1. 1 + cells in normal spleen but not on naive T or B cells.

40|$|In this study, by the {{generation}} of a specific monoclonal antibody, we identified p 75 /AIRM 1 (for adhesion inhibitory receptor molecule 1), a novel inhibitory receptor that is mostly confined to human natural killer cells. p 75 /AIRM 1 is a 75 -kD glycoprotein that, upon sodium pervanadate treatment, becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and associates to src homology 2 domain–bearing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP) - 1. The p 75 /AIRM 1 gene is located on human chromosome 19 and encodes a novel member of the sialoadhesin family characterized by three immunoglobulin-like extracellular domains (one NH 2 -terminal V-type and two C 2 type) and a classical immunoreceptor tyrosine–based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in the cytoplasmic portion. The highest amino acid sequence similarity has been found with the myeloidspecific CD 33 molecule and the placental CD 33 L 1 protein. Similar to other sialoadhesin molecules, p 75 /AIRM 1 appears to mediate sialic acid–dependent ligand recognition.

40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} specific for T {{cell differentiation}} antigens were tested on four cloned populations of lymphocytes {{derived from the}} {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} of an animal immunised with Theileria parva. The clones were defined functionally in terms of cytotoxic activity, MHC restriction and expression of messenger RNA for CD 3 and T cell receptor (TCR). Two clones contained RNA transcripts for CD 3, TCR-alpha and beta and were positive for CD 2, CD 5 and CD 6; one of these was a typical CD 4 + class II MHC-restricted non-cytotoxic clone while the other was a CD 8 + class I MHC-restricted cytotoxic clone. By contrast, the remaining two clones had the characteristics of non-specific killer cells in that they exhibited moderate levels of non-MHC-restricted killing; they contained TCR-delta mRNA and a 1. 2 kb truncated form of TCR-beta message, but they did not contain CD 3 or TCR-alpha mRNA. One of these non-specific <b>killer</b> <b>clones</b> only expressed CD 2 whereas the other clone only expressed CD 8, but without the CD 8 determinant recognised by monoclonal antibodies CC 58 and BAT 52.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{have suggested}} striking similarities between complement-mediated and cell-mediated lysis. Both pathways share the terminal insertion of channels into target membranes, and unique esterases have been postulated {{to participate in}} the activation of cytolytic effector molecules. Since killer-specific esterases and channel-forming proteins can be demonstrated in in vitro cell lines, it is important to ascertain that the described esterase and channel-forming proteins are also present in killer cells from in vivo sources. Results presented here show that killer-cell-specific N alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzyl ester serine esterase is induced in vitro concomitant with the sensitization of cytotoxic effector cells. In contrast, in-vivo-primed cytotoxic T cells or natural killer (NK) cells fail to express high levels of this enzyme. Assay of different cytotoxic effector cells reveals the presence of N alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzyl ester serine esterase in <b>clones</b> with T <b>killer</b> and NK activity, but enzyme levels do not correlate with cytolytic activity nor does inhibition of esterase activity interfere with granule-mediated cell lysis. A similar result is seen with granule-mediated cytolytic activity. Cloned NK and T killer cell lines possess granules that are able to lyse erythrocyte targets. However, T killer cells sensitized in mixed lymphocyte culture or in vivo have no detectable cytotoxic granules. Cytotoxic granules are also not detected in NK cells isolated from animals...|$|R

We now report that B 7 is also expressed on activated human peripheral blood T cells, CD 4 T cell clones, CD 8 T cell <b>clones,</b> and natural <b>killer</b> cell <b>clones.</b> B 7 appears relatively late after T cell activation, {{can be detected}} on both CD 4 and CD 8 T cell subsets, and is present on antigen-specific, major histocompatibility complex-restricted CD 4 and CD 8 T cell clones.

A B 7 + CD 4 + T cell clone was able to stimulate a primary allogeneic mixed lymphocyte response using small, resting peripheral blood T cells as responders. The alloantigen-induced proliferative response and cytokine production was partially inhibited by anti-B 7 monoclonal antibody. Since activated T cells can coexpress both CD 28 and its counter-receptor, B 7, this suggests that activated T cells may be capable of autocrine costimulation via the CD 28 activation pathway...|$|R

Similar to cytotoxic T cells (T.) t induced in vivo in spleen and lung after influenza virus infection of mice (2 - 4), L 4 killer cells are cross-reactive for the different type A influenza viruses, but do not recognize type B influenza virus-infected cells (1). The role of the cross-reactive T, in protection against and recovery from influenza infection or the limitation of spread of the infectioe virus is still uncertain. We have been able to establish a good correlation between levels of memory T, and cross-protection against different type A influenza viruses in vivo (5). In addition, T cells from primed mice lead to a reduction of replication of homologous virus in the recipient mice on adoptive transfer, and this effect is abolished by treatment with anti-Lyt- 2 serum and complement (6). Protection only occurs when donor cells and recipient mice share the K and D end of H- 2. Because T, are restricted at the K and D end of H- 2, this implied that T. might be the effector cells.

HSV type 1 (HSV-I) and HSV type 2 (HSV- 2) common CTL clones inhibited the replication of both HSV-I and HSV- 2 in autologous cells, but not in allogeneic ells. HSV-l-specific CTL clones inhibited the replication of HSV- 1 in autologous cells; however, the replication of HSV- 2 was not inhibited. NK cell clones inhibited the replication of HSV- 1 and HSV- 2 in autologous and allogeneic ells. This is the first demonstration that human virus-specific CTL clones and NK cell clones directly limit virus replication in vitro. It is well known that cytotoxic T cells (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells {{play an important role in}} resistance to herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. To study the function of CTL and NK cells in vitro, 51 Cr release cytotoxicity assays have been universally used.

We observed, using fixed as well as living cells, the occurrence of (pseudo) emperipolesis during the interaction. About 30 % of conjugated NK cells penetrated, partly or completely, into the target cells (in-conjugation). Virtually all in-conjugated target cells exhibited polymerized actin. Killer cells of in-conjugates were frequently seen approaching the target cell nucleus or aligning along it. If the cytotoxic process was inhibited {{by the absence of}} calcium neither actin polymerization nor in-conjugation were observed. A kinetic study showed that in-conjugation starts somewhat later than actin polymerization but still within a few minutes after addition of calcium to conjugates previously formed in the absence of calcium. The presence of cytochalasin D (an inhibitor of actin polymerization) completely inhibited in-conjugation and partly reduced the cytotoxic activity. Zinc ions (endonuclease inhibition) inhibited in-conjugation and decreased the total number of target cells with polymerized actin in a concentration dependent manner. Cytotoxic activity was also reduced but not as efficiently as in-conjugation. Our study demonstrates that in-conjugation represents a significant fraction of the cytotoxic interaction.

Eight monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) with blocking activity were obtained and a preliminary characterization of these antibodies was carried out. The MAbs SPV-L 1 and SPV-L 5 were found to react with thymocytes and all peripheral blood leukocytes. SPV-L 1 and SPV-L 5 precipitated a molecular complex consisting of two noncovalently bound chains of molecular weights of 95 and 160 kD indicating that they recognize the human equivalents of the recently described leukocyte function associated (LFA- 1) antigens. The SPV-L 1 and SPV-L 5 antibodies inhibited the reactivity of six CTL clones tested in this study. In addition, SPV-L 1 and L 5 blocked the lectin dependent cellular cytotoxicity mediated by these CTL <b>clones.</b> Natural <b>killer</b> cell activity mediated by fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes and activated killer cell activity generated in MLC both measured against K 562 was also inhibited by SPV-L 1 and SPV-L 5. Two other antibodies, SPV-L 3 and SPV-L 4 blocked strongly the cytotoxic activity of two T 4 + CTL clones, whereas the reactivity of the three T 8 + CTL clones and one T 4 + CTL clone was not or only moderately inhibited. These antibodies recognized an Ia antigen as judged from tissue distribution and immunoprecipitation studies. However, these latter studies also suggest that SPV-L 3 and SPV-L 4 recognize HLA-DC rather than HLA-DR antigens. Finally, three antibodies (SPV-T 3 a, SPV-T 3 b, SPV-T 3 c) were obtained directed against the T 3 molecular complex and one MAb (SPV-T 8) was found to react with T 8. The anti-T 3 reagents were shown to be mitogenic for peripheral blood lymphocytes, with the exception of SPV-T 3 a. The results presented here indicate that the antigens recognized by SPV-L 1 and SPV-L 5 are involved in various cytotoxic reactions.

40|$|A protein factor which induces {{high levels}} of gamma {{interferon}} (IFN-gamma) in resting splenic nonadherent cells was isolated from the sera of mice with generalized inflammation caused by endotoxic shock. The factor was highly purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by ion-exchange column chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, molecular sieving on Ultrogel AcA 44, and hydrophobic column chromatography with phenyl-Sepharose. It was further purified to apparent homogeneity by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It induced IFN-gamma production in a dose-dependent manner {{in the presence of}} interleukin- 2, monoclonal anti-CD 3 antibody (anti-CD 3 MAb), or concanavalin A (ConA) in spleen cells deprived of plastic plate- and nylon wool-adherent cells. Anti-CD 3 MAb induced the highest level of production of the three. The factor, interleukin- 2, anti-CD 3 MAb, or ConA alone induced a trace of or no detectable IFN-gamma in these cells. The factor also exhibited an accessory function during proliferation in these cells {{in the presence of a}} suboptimal dose of ConA. However, the factor failed to stimulate IFN-gamma production when staphylococcal enterotoxin A, a superantigenic T-cell mitogen, was employed. Treatment with pronase or heat abolished these activities. These studies confirm the existence of a soluble protein factor which is able to exhibit a novel accessory function in IFN-gamma production in resting T or natural killer cells. It will be of interest to compare this factor with the recently <b>cloned</b> human natural <b>killer</b> stimulatory factor (NKSF/IL- 12) ...|$|R
40|$|The Ca 2 +-dependent cytolytic {{activity}} of isolated T-lymphocyte granules was purified to apparent homogeneity by high-salt extraction, gel filtration, and ion-exchange chromatography. The lytic activity resided in a 72 - to 75 -kDa protein of cytolytic granules. Incubation of the isolated protein with erythrocytes {{in the presence}} of Ca 2 + ions resulted in hemolysis and the formation of membrane lesions of 160 A in diameter, corresponding in size and morphology to membrane lesions formed on target cells by <b>cloned,</b> intact natural <b>killer</b> (NK) and cytolytic T lymphocytes. Hence, the 75 -kDa granule protein is identified as monomeric perforin 1 (P 1), postulated previously from the analysis of membrane lesions formed during NK and T-cell-mediated cytolysis. P 1 -mediated hemolysis is Ca 2 +-dependent and is inhibited by Zn 2 + ions. Lysis is accompanied by the polymerization of P 1 to membrane-associated tubular complexes (poly-P 1) that form large transmembrane pores. P 1 causes a rapid membrane depolarization of J 774 cells {{in the presence of}} Ca 2 +. Purified P 1 also induces transmembrane monovalent and divalent ion flow across lipid vesicles only in the presence of Ca 2 +. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of S 49 lymphoma cells show a P 1 -dependent inward membrane current flow in the presence but not in the absence of Ca 2 +. The current increase can be dissected as a summation of discrete current events, indicative of formation of functional channels by polymerization of P 1...|$|R
40|$|Lymphocytes from {{mesenteric}} {{lymph nodes}} of ordinary and nude mice were grown in microtitre wells on embryonic mesenchymal-fibroblast monolayers. Human recombinant interleukin- 2 (80 units ml- 1) was added. <b>Clones</b> of lymphokine-activated <b>killer</b> (LAK) cells developed. The incidence of clone-forming cells was 52 - 136 per 10 (5) cells in lymph nodes from nude mice and 4. 2 - 8. 3 per 10 (5) cells in lymph nodes from ordinary mice. On {{a limited number}} of fibroblast monolayers propagated in culture, the maturing LAK cells were induced to synthesise and secrete 2 types of flowing mucoid material. After methanol fixation and Alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) (at pH 1) staining, the first type of material was distinctively stained turquoise, indicating a highly sulphated proteoglycan, chondroitin sulphate; the second type of material, a macromolecular neutral polysaccharide, was not stained and appeared to have been dissolved. Glycogen was stained deep brilliant purple. After treatment with PAS alone, the chondroitin sulphate was not stained and appeared as a bright area, the neutral polysaccharide mass being stained deep red. This polysaccharide material was characteristically secreted as droplets or 'streamlets' emerging from the cell surface and extending through the first type of material to coalesce with the already accumulated main extracellular mucoid layer spreading between the cells. Clones of secretory LAK cells were obtained from gravid and nongravid mouse uteri as well as from tracheal explants. Change of medium or passage with fresh medium to a new inducing batch of monolayer, at the blastoid-large granular lymphocyte stage (on d 3 to 7), was critical for high reproducibility of secretion. The course of differentiation was found ultimately to be dependent on the embryonic mesenchymal monolayer, suggesting induction by a morphogenetic signal. A correlation can be drawn between the secretory activity and the morphological profile at maturation of highly distinctive organised cells...|$|R
40|$|Recently, we {{reported}} {{the isolation of}} a cDNA clone that encodes a polypeptide which has B cell and T cell growth factor activities. The amino acid sequence of this polypeptide deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA clone showed significant homology with mouse B cell stimulating factor- 1. Because of its multiple biologic activities, it was designated interleukin 4 (IL- 4). Here we describe the effects of supernatants of Cos- 7 mouse cells transfected with the IL- 4 coding cDNA clone in a mammalian expression vector, on human thymocyte T cells and T cell clones. The T cell growth-promoting effect of IL- 4 on preactivated T cells was not inhibited by monoclonal antibodies against IL- 2 or the IL- 2 receptor, indicating that the IL- 4 activity is independent from IL- 2 or the IL- 2 receptor. IL- 4 induces a low proliferative response in thymocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes, but the response was considerably enhanced by preactivation of the thymocytes or peripheral blood T cells. Both T 4 + and T 8 + antigen-specific proliferative and cytotoxic T cell clones and T 3 natural <b>killer</b> <b>clones</b> proliferated in response to IL- 4. But one of six T 4 + and one of four T 8 + T cell clones were consistently found to be unresponsive. The proliferative responses to IL- 4 were always lower than those obtained with IL- 2. Most of the T cell clones generally became unresponsive to IL- 4 10 days after stimulation, but still responded well to IL- 2. These {{results indicate that the}} responsiveness to IL- 4 is relatively short lasting and is regulated by activation signals. Interestingly, IL- 4 acted in synergy with IL- 2 in promoting the growth of T cell clones. Our results establish that IL- 4 can act as a T cell growth factor independently of IL-...|$|R
40|$|A <b>clone</b> {{of natural}} <b>killer</b> (NK) cells (JTB 18) {{was found to}} be ultrastructurally similar to {{peripheral}} blood large granular lymphocytes (LGL). These cells incorporated [35 S]sulfate into cell- associated proteoglycan molecules, which were then isolated by CsCl density gradient centrifugation. As assessed by gel filtration chromatography, the native 35 S-labeled proteoglycan and its beta- eliminated 35 S-labeled glycosaminoglycans were of Mr approximately 200, 000 and 50, 000, respectively. The 35 S-labeled proteoglycans were resistant to proteolysis, since their Mr were apparently not altered by incubation with either pronase or S. aureus V 8 protease. The purified NK cell 35 S-labeled proteoglycans were degraded by approximately 90 % to 35 S-labeled disaccharides with either chondroitinase ABC or AC. High performance liquid chromatographic analysis of the digests revealed these disaccharides to be composed entirely of chondroitin sulfate A (glucuronic acid [...] N-acetylgalactosamine- 4 SO 4). Whole 35 S-labeled cells incubated with chondroitinase ABC failed to release 35 S-labeled disaccharides into the supernatant, and x-ray energy-dispersive analysis revealed that sulfur-containing molecules were present in the intracellular granules, thereby localizing the NK cell-associated proteoglycan primarily in the granules of the cell, rather than on the plasma membrane. The 35 S-labeled cloned NK cells incubated for 30 min to 4 h with K 562 tumor cell targets at a 0. 5 : 1 ratio exocytosed a mean of 49 % of the granular 35 S-labeled proteoglycans during the first 60 min of the culture. Proteoglycan release was maximal with an effector/target cell ratio of 0. 5 : 1 for JTB 18 :K 562. Significant proteoglycan release from JTB 18 NK cells was also obtained with other sensitive target cells such as REX, Molt 4, and CEM, but not with cells such as KG 1 and Laz 156, which have been shown previously to be resistant to killing by this NK cell. Thus, protease-resistant intracellular proteoglycans with chondroitin sulfate A side chains are specifically exocytosed from the granules of human NK effector cells upon contact with sensitive targets, suggesting that these proteoglycans may be involved in the mechanism of cytotoxicity...|$|R
