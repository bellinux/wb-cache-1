5000|$|A {{major role}} for the Dicomed D148 <b>color</b> <b>film</b> <b>recorder,</b> in 1984, was to image the work of 26 {{computer}} graphic animation specialists on to film {{for the production of}} the 15 minute IMAX film; the [...] "Magic Egg".|$|E
5000|$|The company's {{original}} animation system {{consisted of}} a Tektronix display with a 1200 baud modem connection to a remote Amdahl V6 in Bethesda, Maryland, with rendering done on an IBM System 370, recording on an Information International Inc. (III) film recorder in Los Angeles, and final processing and optical printing completed back in New York. The V6 ran APL, and could render {{at a rate of}} one polygon per second. The company later built one of the first frame buffers and video paint systems (the Video Palette), acquired a Harris mini-mainframe computer, and a Dicomed 35mm <b>color</b> <b>film</b> <b>recorder.</b>|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that crown morphology and within-crown color variations, rather than between-crown color differences, are principal keys to the accurate aerial detection of Dutch elm disease (DED). Because within-crown color variations often tend to be very subtle on conventional infrared photographs, microdensitometry and subsequent digital enhancement were evaluated as potential means of improving detection accuracy. Vertical 70 mm color infrared photographs at scales of 1 : 6, 000 and 1 : 12, 000 were taken on several dates during 1979 - 80 over a St. Paul, Minnesota study area containing high incidence of DED. Scanning microdensitometer data from the photographs were processed using three enhancement techniques: color contrast stretch, two-band spectral ratioing, and multiple discriminant analysis. The numerically processed data were subsequently reconverted to image form using a high resolution <b>color</b> <b>film</b> <b>recorder.</b> Experienced interpreters analyzed both the original imagery and the enhanced products. The computer enhanced images dramatically increased the expression of subtle within-crown and between-crown color variations, but only nominally improved detection accuracy. Thus, the factor limiting detection from vertical photography appears to be the inconsistency, not the subtletly, in which DED is manifested as crown color variation...|$|E
50|$|Dicomed (or DICOMED) {{was founded}} in 1968 {{and in the early}} 1970s became a leading {{manufacturer}} of precision <b>color</b> <b>film</b> <b>recorders</b> such as the D47 and D48.|$|R
50|$|Traditional <b>film</b> <b>recorder</b> {{manufacturers}} {{have all but}} vanished from the scene or have evolved their product lines to cater to the motion picture industry. Dicomed was one such early provider of digital <b>color</b> <b>film</b> <b>recorders.</b> Polaroid, Management Graphics, Inc, MacDonald-Detwiler, Information International, Inc., and Agfa were other producers of <b>film</b> <b>recorders.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of color coding techniques used in processing remote sensing imagery {{to analyze and}} display fluid flow data is discussed. A minicomputer based <b>color</b> <b>film</b> recording and <b>color</b> CRT display system is described. High quality, high resolution images of two-dimensional data are produced on the <b>film</b> <b>recorder.</b> Three dimensional data, in large volume, are used to generate color motion pictures in which time is used to represent the third dimension. Several applications and examples are presented. System hardware and software is described...|$|R
