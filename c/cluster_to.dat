5|$|Due to the {{relatively}} vast distances between stars outside the galactic nucleus, collisions between stars {{are thought to be}} rare. In denser regions such as the core of globular clusters or the galactic center, collisions can be more common. Such collisions can produce what are known as blue stragglers. These abnormal stars have a higher surface temperature than the other main sequence stars with the same luminosity of the <b>cluster</b> <b>to</b> which it belongs.|$|E

40|$|Consensus {{clustering}} and meta clustering are {{two important}} {{extensions of the}} classical clustering problem. Given a set of input clusterings of a given dataset, consensus <b>clustering</b> aims <b>to</b> find a single final clustering which is a better fit in some sense than the existing clusterings, and meta <b>clustering</b> aims <b>to</b> group similar input clusterings together so that users only need to examine {{a small number of}} different clusterings. In this paper, we present a new approach, MCC (stands for multiple consensus <b>clustering),</b> <b>to</b> explore multiple <b>clustering</b> views of a given dataset from the input clusterings by combining consensus clustering and meta clustering. In particular, given a set of input clusterings of a particular data set, MCC employs meta <b>clustering</b> <b>to</b> <b>cluster</b> the input clusterings and then uses consensus <b>clustering</b> <b>to</b> generate a consensus for each cluster of the input clusterings. Extensive experimental results on 11 real world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{interaction}} {{of stars in}} the collapsed core region causes tight binary systems to form. As other stars interact with these tight binaries, they increase the energy at the core, which causes the <b>cluster</b> <b>to</b> re-expand. As the mean time for a core collapse is typically less than {{the age of the}} galaxy, many of a galaxy's globular clusters may have passed through a core collapse stage, then re-expanded.|$|E

The Sixth Army remained in Japan until it handed over its occupation responsibilities to the Eighth Army on 31 December 1945. It was deactivated on 25 January 1946, and Krueger retired in July. For his service as {{commander of the}} Sixth Army in World War II, Krueger was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, an oak leaf <b>cluster</b> <b>to</b> his Distinguished Service Medal, and the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.

5|$|Casey had {{intended}} to come ashore {{on the first day}} of the landing at Lingayen Gulf in January 1945 but was delayed a day because the destroyer he was traveling on had to escort a crippled transport. Despite enormous difficulties ASCOM was able to finish numerous projects on time and some ahead of schedule. On 13 February 1945, ASCOM was transferred to USASOS and redesignated the Luzon Base Section (LUBSEC). Casey then resumed his old post, now renamed Chief Engineer, US Army Forces Pacific. For his services as commander of ASCOM, he was awarded the Legion of Merit. He was subsequently awarded a bronze oak leaf <b>cluster</b> <b>to</b> his Distinguished Service Medal for his services as Chief Engineer, US Army Forces Pacific.|$|E
5|$|Core-collapse {{is thought}} to occur when the more massive stars in a {{globular}} cluster encounter their less massive companions. Over time, dynamic processes cause individual stars to migrate {{from the center of}} the <b>cluster</b> <b>to</b> the outside. This results in a net loss of kinetic energy from the core region, leading the remaining stars grouped in the core region to occupy a more compact volume. When this gravothermal instability occurs, the central region of the cluster becomes densely crowded with stars and the surface brightness of the cluster forms a power-law cusp. (Note that a core collapse is not the only mechanism that can cause such a luminosity distribution; a massive black hole at the core can also result in a luminosity cusp.) Over a lengthy period of time this leads to a concentration of massive stars near the core, a phenomenon called mass segregation.|$|E

A refinement process is conducted between <b>clustering</b> and regression <b>to</b> get accurate <b>clustering</b> results by removing outliers and merging the clusters that fit the same model.

5|$|On {{the largest}} scale, the Universe is {{continually}} expanding, {{resulting in an}} average increase in the separation between individual galaxies (see Hubble's law). Associations of galaxies can overcome this expansion on a local scale through their mutual gravitational attraction. These associations formed early in the Universe, as clumps of dark matter pulled their respective galaxies together. Nearby groups later merged to form larger-scale clusters. This on-going merger process (as well as an influx of infalling gas) heats the inter-galactic gas within a <b>cluster</b> <b>to</b> very high temperatures, reaching 30–100 megakelvins. About 70–80% of the mass in a cluster {{is in the form}} of dark matter, with 10–30% consisting of this heated gas and the remaining few percent of the matter in the form of galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Somervell still pursued his own designs, making {{important}} changes, {{including the}} addition of a fifth story. The outbreak of war led to a new urgency, and by May 1942, some 13,000 workers were working around the clock on the building, which was completed in early 1943 at a cost of $63 million, the overrun being caused by the emphasis on speed and {{the addition of}} the extra floor. For his work with the Construction Division, Somervell was awarded an oak leaf <b>cluster</b> <b>to</b> his Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of globular clusters remains a poorly understood phenomenon {{and it remains}} uncertain whether the stars in a globular cluster form in a single generation or are spawned across multiple generations {{over a period of}} several hundred million years. In many globular clusters, most of the stars are at approximately the same stage in stellar evolution, suggesting that they formed at about the same time. However, the star formation history varies from <b>cluster</b> <b>to</b> cluster, with some clusters showing distinct populations of stars. An example of this is the globular clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that exhibit a bimodal population. During their youth, these LMC clusters may have encountered giant molecular clouds that triggered a second round of star formation. This star-forming period is relatively brief, compared to the age of many globular clusters.|$|E
