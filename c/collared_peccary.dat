25|$|Five {{terrestrial}} ecoregions extend {{across the}} state. The Southern Pacific dry forests {{lie on the}} southern slopes of the Sierra Madre del Sur, extending from the coast up to 1400 meters elevation. The forests are predominantly deciduous during the long dry season. The Sierra Madre del Sur pine-oak forests occupy the higher slopes of the Sierra Madre del Sur. These forests harbor a great diversity of species, including many endemic orchids, butterflies, and birds. The Balsas dry forests lie in the basin of the Balsas River, north of the Sierra Madre del Sur, and are notable for the diversity of mammal species, including jaguarundi, coati, ocelot, and <b>collared</b> <b>peccary.</b> The northernmost {{part of the state}} includes portions of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests, which occupy the mountainous northern rim of the Balsas basin.

American black bear Ursus americanus is also found but in very small numbers. The Mexican wolf, once abundant, has been extirpated. The main cause of degradation has been grazing.

40|$|In this study, the {{microsatellite}} {{technique was}} used to evaluate the genetic variability in populations of <b>collared</b> and white-lipped <b>peccaries</b> kept in captivity. Six primers developed for domestic pigs were used and amplified in both species. They revealed the presence of five polymorphic loci and one monomorphic locus. The polymorphic loci included 4 of the 16 alleles in <b>collared</b> <b>peccaries,</b> and 3 of the 10 alleles in the white-lipped peccaries. Polymorphic information content (PIC) in both species and all the loci was highly informative. The probability of paternity exclusion (PEC), if one of the parents is known, was almost as high in white-lipped peccaries (95. 53 %) as in the collared (99, 48 %). The Fst values for collared (0. 042) and white-lipped (0. 1387) peccaries showed that both populations are not structured.

Based on mtDNA, the collared and the giant peccaries are estimated to have diverged 1.0-1.2 million years ago, but these results have been considered questionable due to the low bootstrap support, small sample size, {{and the absence of}} nDNA and cytogenetic results.

The major genetic split within the <b>collared</b> <b>peccary</b> is between a clade comprising North and Central American specimens, and a clade comprising South American specimens (the presumed contact zone is in Colombia, which has both clades).

40|$|This work aims to {{determine}} the most suitable nonlinear model to describe the growth of female <b>collared</b> <b>peccaries</b> (Pecari tajacu). The monthly records {{of the weight of}} 10 captive female <b>collared</b> <b>peccaries</b> over a period of two years in the Brazilian Amazon Region were used. The growth models used were the Von Bertalanffy, Brody, Gompertz and Logistic. The parameters were estimated by using the NLIN procedure from the SAS application. The criteria used to verify the adjustment of the models were: asymptotic standard deviation (ASD); coefficient of determination (R²); average absolute residual deviation (ARD) and the asymptotic rate (AR). The Brody model and the Logistic model estimated the highest (19. 44 kg) and the lowest (19. 18 kg) asymptotic weight (A), indicating the lowest (0. 0070 kg/day) and the highest (0. 0121 kg/day) maturation rate (K). These results and the coefficients of phenotypic correlation that varied from - 0. 75 and - 0. 47 confirmed the antagonistic nature between these parameters. The Brody model estimated the lower value for ARD, a limiting factor for describing the lowest value for AR through this model. The Brody model showed the best adjustment for AR, although the other models also showed a suitable adjustment to the weight data of said species/gender. Based on the AR obtained in this work, the Brody model is recommended for adjusting the growth curve of the female <b>collared</b> <b>peccaries.</b> Depending on the estimated values, especially for K, this trait can be included in a selection index...|$|R

Nevertheless, {{in the production of}} this one and other wild species of the Amazon region few ones are the studies destined to determine the infectious and/or parasitic illnesses that they cause low in his production. Such is the case of the Trypanosoma sp. which has been brought in a fortuitous way in <b>collared</b> <b>peccaries,</b> not {{going so far as to}} determine the implied species, fact that receives big importance because someone species of this parasite are zoonotics. The objective of the present study was to determine the presence of Trypanosoma sp. in <b>collared</b> <b>peccaries</b> in captivity of Iquitos and Moyobamba, for which they were sampled 38 <b>collared</b> <b>peccaries</b> proceeding from three breeding grounds and whose ages were fluctuating between 3 months and 2 years. The used tests were of the microcapillary or method of Woo and of the blood smear. The realized analyses did not allow us to determine the presence of the Trypanosoma sp. in the analyzed samples, nevertheless these results it does not indicate us that the illness should not exist in the <b>collared</b> <b>peccaries</b> of our Amazon region, but rather he allows us to conclude that they are more exhaustive necessary studies, with the employment of test with major sensibility as that of the PCR, which allow us to determine the real presentation of this illness, as well as to determine if it is that the Trypanosoma sp. in the <b>collared</b> <b>peccaries,</b> he behaves like in pigs in whom his detection is difficult for routine methods, since the period of parasitaemia is short. La crianza del sajino (Tayassu tajacu) en cautiverio en nuestra amazonía está orientada a la obtención de carne y cuero, este último con fines de exportación para la fabricación de guantes y peleterías, manteniéndose el Perú como único exportador mundial de cueros de esta especie. Sin embargo, en la producción de esta y otras especies silvestres tropicales presentan escasos estudios que determinan las enfermedades infecciosas y/o parasitarias que ocasionan bajas en su producción. Tal es el caso del Trypanosoma sp. donde algunas de sus especies son zoonóticos. El objetivo del presente estudio fue determinar la presencia de Trypanosoma sp. en sajinos en cautiverio de Iquitos y Moyabamba. Se colectaron muestras de sangre de 38 sajinos procedentes de tres zoocriaderos y cuyas edades fluctuaban entre 3 meses y 2 años. Las técnicas diagnósticas empleadas fueron del microcapilar o técnica de Woo y del Frotis sanguíneo delgado. No se halló la presencia de Trypanosoma sp. en las muestras examinadas por diferentes razones entre ellas la baja sensibilidad de las técnicas usadas. La técnica de evaluación de riesgo por simulación Monte Carlo (programa @Risk) indico que el 95 % de las observaciones analizadas se encontraron en un intervalo de 0. 006 a 0. 854 % y que la probabilidad de encontrar la infección real en sajinos provenientes de Iquitos y Moyobamba se encuentra en un rango promedio de infección de 0. 02 %.

In order to optimize breeding management of captive born <b>collared</b> <b>peccaries</b> in semiarid conditions, the objective was to describe and correlate the changes in the ovarian ultrasonographic pattern, hormonal profile, vulvar appearance, and vaginal cytology during the estrus cycle in this species. During 45 days, females (n= 4) were subjected each three days to blood collection destined to hormonal dosage by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). In the same occasions, evaluation of external genitalia, ovarian ultrasonography and vaginal cytology were conducted. Results are presented as means and standard deviations. According to hormonal dosage, six estrous cycles were identified as lasting 21. 0 ± 5. 7 days, being on average 6 days for the estrogenic phase and 15 days for the progesterone phase. Estrogen presented mean peak values of 55. 6 ± 20. 5 pg/mL. During the luteal phase, the high values for progesterone were 35. 3 ± 4. 4 ng/mL. The presence of vaginal mucus, a reddish vaginal mucosa and the separation of the vulvar lips were verified in all animals during the estrogenic peak. Through ultrasonography, ovarian follicles measuring 0. 2 ± 0. 1 cm were visualized during the estrogen peak. Corpora lutea presented hyperechoic regions measuring 0. 4 ± 0. 2 cm identified during luteal phase. No significant differences (P> 0. 05) between proportions of vaginal epithelial cells were identified when comparing estrogenic and progesterone phases. In conclusion, female <b>collared</b> <b>peccaries,</b> captive born in semiarid conditions, have an estral cycle that lasts 21. 0 ± 5. 7 days, with estrous signs characterized by vulvar lips edema and hyperemic vaginal mucosa, coinciding with developed follicles and high estrogen levels...|$|R
