The {{purpose of the}} work: the increase in efficiency of the production quality control {{on the base of}} the expenditures analysis for the quality control. The system of the production quality control as the information system has been developed. The including elements represent the expenditures required for the prevention from the rejection and the production quality evaluation, and the outcoming elements - the expenditures required for the inner and outer rejected production. Study of the expenditures, required for the production quality ensurance will allow to use the investigation results as the tool for planning, <b>control</b> <b>and</b> <b>checking</b> by the industrial enterprises administration, and, by this, to provide the more profitable use of the resources. The results of the work have been introduced in the Irak enterprises.

40|$|Conventional {{velocity}} {{analysis is}} usually {{done in a}} relatively spare grid, for instance every half kilometers, during the processing of seismic data. It is very laborious work and very subjective. To deliver an accurate velocity picking, processing geophysicists must have {{a good understanding of}} geological background of area being analyzed and experiences. Velocity errors often occur during picking. Proper quality <b>control</b> <b>and</b> <b>checking</b> are a must. A good and reliable velocity field is very important in seismic processing for achieving high-quality seismic images as well as for delivering an accurate depth conversion. The new method presented here, was developed to correct velocity errors automatically by means of residual velocity correction, and to produce an offset-dependent RMS velocity field at the same time. The method is data driven, based on the normal move out equation (NMO) and measuring the local even correlation between adjacent traces. The stacking velocity is derived simply by averaging the velocity field. The proposed method was tested on synthetic and real data examples with good result. The velocity field has certain characteristics related to hydrocarbon presence. Supriyono (2011 and 2012) developed a new DHI method using velocity gradient attributes by cross-plotting the velocity versus offset (VVO). The velocity gradient exhibits high anomalous values in the presence of gas...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: {{the process of}} the {{automatic}} <b>control</b> <b>and</b> <b>checking</b> the position of the blank on the multi-purpose machine tool before the processing. The purpose of the work: nesuring the accuracy of processing of the casing parts on the multi-purpose machines by the automatic check of blanks due to the selection and realization of the rational variants of measurement of its position. The universal method of the blank position automatic control has been developed. On the base of the mathematical model, the factors influencing on the control accuracy have been established. The formulae for a design of the automatic control accuracy have been obtained. The dependences between the accuracy of control and the resulting accuracy of processing have been established. The algorithm for determination of the blank position intended of the NPC machine devices, the methods of design of the machining accuracy using the blank position automatic control, the programs for the computer on the blank position design in the measured points and analysis of the accuracy to be reached in the determination of the blank coordinates at the automatic control of its position have been developed.

The {{aim is to}} develop the CACC logical design methods based {{on the use of}} the application domain representation models as the functional (application) specifications. The folloeing methods have been developed: conceptual models and method of their complex analysis of the introduced quality coefficients and indices; methodical provision formalizing the investigated field on the specification model level. The tooling complex including the methods, algorithms and software has been created. The complex acceletates the CACC development time and permits to perform the qualitative analysis of the designs made.

40|$|Land cover mapping in {{most cases}} results in {{thematic}} maps which are in general not a perfect representation of the reality. They always contain errors due to the method used for its production or simply the difficulty {{that in many cases}} the land use is not equivalent to the land cover and semantic knowledge of an interpreter has to be used to derive the finally wanted object type. In order to assess the reliability of a particular land use map procedures for quality <b>control</b> <b>and</b> <b>checking</b> the geometry and thematic contents of the mapped objects have to be applied. The result of an accuracy evaluation typically provides the user with an overall accurcy of the map and the accuracy for each class (object type) in the map. Conducting a proper accuracy assessment of a product created using remotely sensed data can be time and resource consuming and respectively expensive, especially if no appropriate or up-to-date reference material is available and ground truth data has to be collected. In this paper a method is presented, which makes use of reference data (thematic maps), which have been produced in another context using class descriptions which slightly differ from the class descriptions used in the actual land use mapping and which have been generated some years before the actual mapping. It can be shown, {{that it is possible to}} use this “obsolete ” data for accuracy checks, because means are implemented to find those areas in the reference data, which are out-of-date or which have been falsely assigned to the class which is inspected. The procedure allows to exclude these areas from the computation of accuracy measures. The method has been implemented in ArcGIS 9 using SQL-based algorithms...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{appropriate}} extraction <b>and</b> amplification <b>controls</b> for acellular specimens is not standardized {{in the clinical}} laboratory community. Extraction <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> <b>checks</b> for inhibitors of amplification in cellular specimens are most often accomplished by amplification of an internal human genomic target. This approach is not feasible for acellular specimens, which may contain little or no amplifiable genomic material. Other specimen types, such as stool, frequently contain amplification inhibitors. Failure to test for these inhibitors can result in the reporting of false-negative results. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate the use of a T 4 bacteriophage as an extraction <b>and</b> amplification <b>control</b> for acellular specimens. The T 4 bacteriophage assay was evaluated for use as a control in 290 specimens, including cerebrospinal fluid, serum, and filtered stool. Extraction procedures on two automated instruments were assessed, including the Roche MagNAPure Compact (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and the QIAGEN BioRobot M 48 (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA), along with the manual QIAGEN extraction method.
