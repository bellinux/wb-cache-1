60|$|After this, Gyp was daily {{more and}} more in contact with high bohemia, that curious <b>composite</b> <b>section</b> of society which embraces the neck of music, poetry, and the drama. She was a success, but {{secretly}} she felt that she did not belong to it, nor, in truth, did Fiorsen, who was much too genuine a bohemian, and artist, and mocked at the Gallants and even the Roseks of this life, as he mocked at Winton, Aunt Rosamund, and their world. Life with him had certainly one effect on Gyp; it made her feel less and less a part of that old orthodox, well-bred world which she had known before she married him; but to which she had confessed to Winton she had never felt that she belonged, since she knew the secret of her birth. She was, in truth, much too impressionable, too avid of beauty, and perhaps too naturally critical to accept the dictates of their fact-and-form-governed routine; only, of her own accord, she would never have had initiative enough to step out of its circle. Loosened from those roots, unable to attach herself to this new soil, and not spiritually leagued with her husband, she was {{more and more}} lonely. Her only truly happy hours were those spent with Winton or at her piano or with her puppies. She was always wondering at what she had done, longing to find the deep, the sufficient reason for having done it. But the more she sought and longed, the deeper grew her bewilderment, her feeling of being in a cage. Of late, too, another and more definite uneasiness had come to her.|$|E

The original concept had a conventional steel structure above level +175m but Arup found that this configuration would be too lively and lead to unacceptable vibrations of the stay cables. Using a heavier <b>composite</b> <b>section</b> instead of a pure steel structure solved this problem. For reasons of durability and to enhance the appearance, further studies concluded that the tower skin should be fabricated from a duplex stainless steel (grade 1.4462 to BSEN10088) with a shot peened surface finish. The deck itself is made of steel in the main span and of concrete in the side spans.|$|E

Concrete pylon height with typical H-shape is 103m and constructed by auto climbing form. The main span of 327m across the lake is constructed using the free cantilever method and the side span of 57.5m is constructed by the full staging method.The combination of <b>composite</b> <b>section</b> (reinforced concrete deck and I-shaped steel girder) for the center span and concrete section for side spans applied to the bridge because of decreasing effect of weight balance. Concrete pylon has typical H-shape. The leg shape beneath the superstructure level, on the other hand, needs to be narrow {{down a little bit}} to make the size of foundation smaller mainly for less rock excavation at foundation locations and better handling of construction unit(caisson) considering the site condition. Cable is MSS(Multi Strand System) as 2 planes semi-fan. An extra pier support in each side span has been applied. To maximize the counter weight effect by concrete girder at side span, it is necessary to make the side span heavier as possible and not to have excessive bending moment by increasing dead load at the same time. Here, the extra pier support gives more opportunity for having more weight and stiffness in side span without resulting in excessive bending moment in girders and pylons.|$|E

5000|$|As {{with all}} image filters, it is {{required}} to match each section into a section of identical image impedance if the theoretical filter response is to be achieved. This is a particular difficulty for the end sections of the filter which are often working into resistive terminations which cannot be matched exactly by an image impedance. Hence {{the use of the}} mm'-type as end sections for the filter because of its nearly flat impedance with frequency characteristic in the passband. However, it is not desirable to use it throughout the entire filter. The workhorse of image filters are the k-type sections and these will usually be required somewhere in the filter for good rejection in the stopband well away from cut-off and also because they are the simplest topology and lowest component count. Unfortunately, neither side of a mm'-type can match into a k-type. The solution is to form a <b>composite</b> <b>section</b> from a mm'-type half-section and a m-type section which will match each other on one side if m has the same value for both half-sections. This can, for instance, produce a composite T-section with [...] facing the termination and [...] facing the rest of the filter. The T-section will be matched internally with [...] This has the additional incidental advantage of producing two poles of attenuation in the stopband at different frequencies. This is a consequence of m and mm necessarily being different values.|$|E

These revised <b>composite</b> <b>sections</b> were constructed using correlation intervals of a few centimeters instead of the 1 - to 10 -m intervals used in the shipboard composite construction procedure. These revised <b>composite</b> depth <b>sections</b> now take into account differential stretching and squeezing within a core and correct depth differences between holes caused by coring artifact and tectonic disturbances that resulted in attenuated and incomplete <b>sections.</b> The revised <b>composite</b> depth <b>sections</b> were constructed by combining digitized color images of split cores, visual core descriptions from shipboard operations, and color reflectance measurements with a 2 -cm sampling resolution.

40|$|This paper {{emphasizes}} material nonlinear {{effects on}} composite beams with recourse to the plastic hinge method. Numerous combinations {{of steel and}} concrete sections form arbitrary composite sections. Secondly, the material properties of composite beams vary remarkably across its section from ductile steel to brittle concrete. Thirdly, concrete is weak in tension, so <b>composite</b> <b>section</b> changes are dependent on load distribution. To this end, the plastic zone approach is convenient for inelastic analysis of composite sections that can evaluate member resistance, including material nonlinearities, by routine numerical integration with respect to every fiber across the <b>composite</b> <b>section.</b> As a result, many researchers usually adopt the plastic zone approach for numerical inelastic analyses of composite structures. On the other hand, the plastic hinge method describes nonlinear material behaviour of an overall <b>composite</b> <b>section</b> integrally. Consequently, proper section properties for use in plastic hinge spring stiffness are required to represent the material behaviour across the arbitrary whole <b>composite</b> <b>section.</b> In view of numerical efficiency and convergence, the plastic hinge method is superior to the plastic zone method. Therefore, based on the plastic hinge approach, how to incorporate the material nonlinearities of the arbitrary <b>composite</b> <b>section</b> into the plastic hinge stiffness formulation becomes a prime objective of the present paper.

40|$|In the {{solution}} of the Saint Venant problem for <b>composite</b> <b>sections,</b> the general method of attack is the introduction of the conjugate torsion and flexure functions and the reduction of the problem to a Dirichlet type problem. For the orthotropic portion of the section this first involves a transformation of variables and the definition of function harmonic over the transformed variables;In the flexure problem the concept of the center of elasticity is introduced. This center of elasticity plays the same role in the flexure problem as the geometric centroid for the completely isotropic section. It has been pointed out that loading along a geometric axis of symmetry of the section does not insure the absence of a twisting effect. The Young 2 Ì† 7 s moduli in the z direction of the respective portions of the section are the only elastic constants entering into the definition of the center of elasticity. If the portions of the section have the same Young 2 Ì† 7 s modulus in the z direction regardless of what the other elastic properties of the isotropic or orthotropic portion may be, the center of elasticity will correspond to the geometric center;Solutions have been obtained for <b>composite</b> <b>sections</b> whose boundaries are concentric circles, similar ellipses, confocal ellipses, eccentric circles and rectangles.
