25|$|Cyanides are {{produced}} by certain bacteria, fungi, and algae and are found {{in a number of}} <b>plants.</b> <b>Cyanides</b> are found in substantial amounts in certain seeds and fruit stones, e.g., those of apricots, apples, and peaches. In <b>plants,</b> <b>cyanides</b> are usually bound to sugar molecules in the form of cyanogenic glycosides and defend the plant against herbivores. Cassava roots (also called manioc), an important potato-like food grown in tropical countries (and the base from which tapioca is made), also contain cyanogenic glycosides.|$|R
50|$|Other {{components}} of the works included a Carr's disintegrator which crushed glass to add to filter vats of fine damped sand through which chlorine gas was passed, then chlorine water was added from above to dissolve out the gold. Eight precipitating vats, each about 3m in diameter by 1m deep, were used to precipitate gold from solutions. The precipitate was burnt in a reverberatory furnace, leaving the ash and gold to be smelted, or sometimes the gold was redissolved and precipitated, after which it was smelted. With the advance of cyanide treatment technology, introduced commercially to Charters Towers by the Australian Gold Recovery Company in 1892, the low cost of handling and treating sands and slimes and the utter simplicity of the new process, meant that the chlorination works, once so prosperous, became redundant and were shut down. The Forrest-McArthur cyanidation process of treating mill tailings was perfected by 1895. In 1899 there were 96 <b>cyaniding</b> <b>plants</b> in Charters Towers. That was the year of peak gold production - 319,572 fine ozs.|$|R
50|$|Gold mining {{commenced}} in the Clonbinane {{area around}} 1870 and lasted until around 1880.

40|$|Goal, scope, and background: Cyanide is {{commonly}} found in soils and groundwater complexed with iron as ferro- and ferri-cyanide. It is evident that plants are capable of tolerating, transporting, and assimilating iron cyanides. The objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate the influence of temperatures on the removal and bioaccumulation of two chemical forms of iron cyanides by maize seedlings. Materials and methods: Maize (Zea mays L. var. ZN 304) seedlings were grown hydroponically and treated with ferro- or ferri-cyanide in solution for 5 days. Six different temperatures were tested ranging from 12 to 27 °C. Total cyanide in solution phase and plant tissues was analyzed spectrophotometrically. The temperature coefficient (Q 10) was also determined for maize exposed to both iron cyanides. Results: The dissociation of both iron cyanides to free cyanide in solution was below the detection limit. Maize seedlings showed a significantly higher removal potential for ferro-cyanide than ferri-cyanide at all treatment temperatures. Analysis of mass balance revealed that the majority of these iron cyanides taken up from the hydroponic solutions was assimilated by maize, and roots were the major sink for cyanide accumulation. The Q 10 values were determined for ferro- and ferri-cyanide to be 2. 31 and 2. 75, respectively. Discussion: Due to the significant difference in the removal rate between the two species of iron <b>cyanides</b> by <b>plant,</b> the conversion of ferri- to ferro-cyanide in aqueous solution prior to uptake is unlikely. Compared to the treatments amended with ferro-cyanide, more cyanide was recovered in plant materials of maize when exposed to ferri-cyanide, implying that ferri-cyanide is less sensitive to degradation than ferro-cyanide. Although the velocity of botanical assimilation of ferro-cyanide was faster than that of ferri-cyanide at any of the treatment temperatures, the removal of ferri-cyanide by maize was more sensitive to changes in temperature than that of ferro-cyanide. Conclusions: Removal of both iron cyanides by maize seedlings was observed to be positive in response to temperatures. Changes in temperatures have a substantial influence on not only the uptake and assimilation of ferro- and ferri-cyanide by maize but also <b>cyanide</b> accumulation in <b>plant</b> tissues. Recommendations: As one of the crucial abiotic factors involved in phytoremediation, temperature shows a positive influence on the removal of iron <b>cyanides</b> by <b>plants.</b> Further investigation on the fate of ferro- and ferri-cyanide in plant tissues would have helped distinguish the differences in the botanical assimilation pathways between the two iron cyanides. Perspectives: The ability of maize to remove iron cyanides has important implications on the vegetation management of environmental contamination. © Springer-Verlag 2009. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Cyanogenic glucosides (CNglcs) are {{widespread}} plant defence {{compounds that}} release toxic hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> by <b>plant</b> b-glucosidase activity after tissue damage. Specialised insect herbivores have evolved counter strategies and some sequester CNglcs, but {{the underlying mechanisms}} to keep CNglcs intact during feeding and digestion are unknown. We show that CNglc-sequestering Zygaena filipendulae larvae combine behavioural, morphological, physiological and biochemical strategies at different time points during feeding and digestion to avoid toxic hydrolysis of the CNglcs present in their Lotus food plant, i. e. cyanogenesis. We found that a high feeding rate limits the time for plant b-glucosidases to hydrolyse CNglcs. Larvae performed leaf-snipping, a minimal disruptive feeding mode that prevents mixing of plant b-glucosidases and CNglcs. Saliva extracts did not inhibit plant cyanogenesis. However, a highly alkaline midgut lumen inhibited the activity of ingested plant b-glucosidases significantly. Moreover, insect b-glucosidases from the saliva and gut tissue did not hydrolyse the CNglcs present in Lotus. The strategies disclosed may also be used by other insect species to overcome CNglc-based plant defence and to sequester these compounds intact...|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} free cyanide and strongly-complexed <b>cyanide</b> {{measurement}} within <b>plant</b> tissue {{was developed to}} study uptake and movement of cyanide species separately from cyanide metabolism and metabolite movement by a willow plant (Salix eriocephala var.

Spike recoveries from solutions with and without plant tissue, using various solvent combinations, and background control tissue contributions were investigated to obtain an accurate and precise extraction method for measurement of complexed and free <b>cyanide</b> concentrations within <b>plant</b> tissue. The optimum extraction technique involved the freezing of plant tissue with liquid nitrogen to facilitate homogenization prior to extraction. Homogenized willow tissue samples, 1 to 1. 5 g-fresh weight, were ground a second time under liquid nitrogen followed by grinding in slurry with 2. 5 M NaOH. The slurry was brought to 100 mL volume, sonicated for 5 min, extracted {{in the dark for}} 16 h, and analyzed without filtration for total and free cyanide by acid distillation and microdiffusion respectively. Sample tissue extraction controls found recoveries of 89 % and 100 % for 100 µg L- 1 CNT as KCN and K 4 Fe(CN) 6 spiked in willow tissue slurries. Methanol, hexane, and 2 -octanol inclusion in the solvent matrix with 2. 5 M NaOH interfered with the cyanide analytical technique while chloroform reacted with NaOH and free cyanide in solution. Filtration was not included due to increased cyanide loss, and analysis of control tissue showed minimal release of cyanide or interference of plant tissue with the cyanide analytical method. Tissue cyanide concentrations from hydroponicallyexposed tissue using the optimal extraction method agreed with tissue cyanide stable isotope (15 N) results...|$|R
