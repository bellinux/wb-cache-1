25|$|After Napoleon III's abdication {{following}} the disastrous French {{defeat in the}} Battle of Sedan, French war powers fell into {{the hand of a}} republican government led by Léon Gambetta. He vigorously organized national defense and the continued manufacture of war equipment. Most of the <b>conventional</b> <b>weapon</b> manufacturing was located in provincial France, but some mitrailleuse repair and even construction continued inside Paris during the city's four-month siege.|$|E
25|$|The thermobaric device {{yields the}} {{equivalent}} of 44 tons of TNT using about seven tons of {{a new type of}} high explosive. Because of this, the bomb's blast and pressure wave have a similar effect to a small tactical nuclear weapon, although on a smaller scale. The bomb works by detonating in mid-air. Most damage is inflicted by a supersonic shockwave and extremely high temperatures. Thermobaric weapons differ from conventional explosive weapons in that they generate a longer, more sustained blast wave with greater temperatures. In doing so, they produce more damage over a larger area than a <b>conventional</b> <b>weapon</b> of similar mass.|$|E
25|$|Biological {{weapons are}} {{difficult}} to detect, economical and easy to use, making them appeal to the terrorists. The cost of a biological weapon {{is estimated to be}} about 0.05 percent the cost of a <b>conventional</b> <b>weapon</b> in order to produce similar numbers of mass casualties per kilometer square. Moreover, their production is very easy as common technology can be used to produce biological warfare, like that used in production of vaccines, foods, spray devices, beverages and antibiotics. A major factor about biological warfare that attracts terrorists is that they can easily escape, before the government agencies or secret agencies have even started their investigation. This is because the potential organism has incubation period of 3 to 7 days, after which the results begin to appear, thereby giving the terrorists a lead.|$|E

500|$|Opposition to {{the plan}} was {{widespread}} within Congress. Critics pointed out {{that many of the}} original problems remained in both areas of performance and expense. In particular it seemed the B-52 fitted with electronics similar to the B-1B would be equally able to avoid interception, as the speed advantage of the B-1 was now minimal. It also appeared that the [...] "interim" [...] time frame served by the B-1B would be less than a decade, being rendered obsolete shortly after the introduction of a much more capable ATB design. The primary argument in favor of the B-1 was its large <b>conventional</b> <b>weapon</b> payload, and that its takeoff performance allowed it to operate with a credible bomb load from a much wider variety of airfields. The USAF spread production subcontracts across many congressional districts, making the aircraft more popular on Capitol Hill.|$|E
2500|$|Part of {{the safety}} and arming system on the WE.177 series was a simple key {{operated}} Strike Enable Facility; using a cylindrical barrel key {{similar to those used}} on gaming machines. [...] By agreement with the owners of the lock's design rights, the key profile for each and every live weapon was unique, and would not be used for any other purpose. [...] The profile for the training rounds was also not used elsewhere, but all training rounds used the same profile. [...] The physical safety characteristics of WE.177 were probably comparable to similar U.S. weapons, e.g. using the concept of being 'one-point-safe'. [...] The safety and arming system was more sophisticated than on a conventional shell or bomb. [...] The WE.177 safety and arming system had three safety breaks (which varied according to delivery mode) in the arming chain, whereas a <b>conventional</b> <b>weapon</b> only requires two.|$|E

40|$|Resumé Prohibited {{means and}} ways of {{conducting}} armed conflicts - <b>conventional</b> <b>weapons</b> The theme of this thesis is "Prohibited means {{and ways of}} conducting armed conflicts - conventional weapons". Given {{that it is a}} very broad topic, this thesis focuses on restrictions on the use of certain <b>conventional</b> <b>weapons.</b> <b>Conventional</b> <b>weapons</b> are all weapon systems which cannot be included among the weapons of massive destruction. The first part is focuses on the historical development of the law of war - {{it is one of the}} oldest international public law at all. The following section discusses its basic principles which are, in fact, the very base of all prohibitions applied. It is the principle of humanity, the principle of military necessity, the principle of prohibition of non- discrimination, the principle of proportionality and the principle of prohibition of causing excessive injuries and unnecessary suffering. The next section deals with the various conventions prohibiting or restricting use of certain <b>conventional</b> <b>weapons,</b> those which were adopted at the turn of the 20 th century. Attention is paid to the St. Petersburg Declaration (1868), being the first international document prohibiting the use of one particular type of <b>conventional</b> <b>weapons,</b> and then to some documents adopted at the 1 st and the 2 nd Hague [...] ...|$|R
