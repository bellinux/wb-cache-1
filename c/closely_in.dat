5|$|Following <b>closely</b> <b>in</b> the {{footsteps}} of Sir Walter Scott, the novel uses its truthful historical backdrop to tell a fictional story of people who sculpted the past. The novel addresses themes of passionate love, vengeful trickery, and social status. While it is disdained by critics in favor of Balzac's later work, the novel marks {{a turning point in}} his life and artistry.|$|E

5|$|As a manifesto, this {{paragraph}} became {{significant for the}} amalgamation of symphonic and dramatic elements in the same musical composition. Musicologist Hugh MacDonald writes that as Berlioz kept the idea of symphonic construction <b>closely</b> <b>in</b> mind, he allowed the orchestra to express {{the majority of the}} drama in instrumental music and set expository and narrative sections in words. Fellow musicologist Nicholas Temperley suggests that, in Roméo, Berlioz created a model for how a dramatic text could guide the structure of a choral symphony without circumventing that work from being recognizably a symphony. In this sense, musicologist Mark Evans Bonds writes, the symphonies of Liszt and Mahler owe a debt of influence to Berlioz.|$|E

5|$|Chapman's fame as a cricketer {{made him}} a popular public figure; he and his wife, whom he married in 1925, were well known figures in fashionable society and their {{appearances}} were followed <b>closely</b> <b>in</b> the press. Outside of cricket, {{he worked for a}} brewery. In his later years, Chapman increasingly suffered from the effects of alcoholism and was often seen drunk in public. He and his wife divorced in 1942; he spent his final years, mainly alone, suffering from depression, arthritis and a continued dependence on alcohol. Following a fall at his home and a subsequent operation, Chapman died in 1961, aged 61.|$|E
5|$|Harding's death {{came as a}} great {{shock to}} the nation. The {{president}} was liked and admired, and the press and public had followed his illness closely, and been reassured by his apparent recovery. Harding was returned to his train in a casket for a journey across the nation followed <b>closely</b> <b>in</b> the newspapers. Nine million people lined the tracks as Harding's body was taken from San Francisco to Washington, D.C., and after services there, home to Marion, Ohio, for burial.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s however Dessau's {{original}} arguments received powerful restatement {{and expansion}} from Sir Ronald Syme, who devoted three books {{to the subject}} and was prepared to date {{the writing of the}} work <b>closely</b> <b>in</b> the region of AD 395. Other recent studies also show much consistency of style, and most scholars now accept the theory of a single author of unknown identity, writing after 395. Although it was believed that the History Augusta did not reference any material from Ammianus Marcellinus' history, which was finished before 391 and which covered the same period, this has now been shown not to be the case, and that the Historia Augusta does in fact make reference to Ammianus' history.|$|E

5|$|Among the {{perquisites}} of the Times appointment were {{a company}} {{car and a}} large and splendid office at the paper's building in Printing House Square, London. Levin accepted neither; he could not drive and he hated to be isolated. He commandeered a desk in the anteroom to the editor's office, a location that kept him <b>closely</b> <b>in</b> touch with the daily affairs of the paper. It also gave him ready access to the editor, William Rees Mogg, with whom he developed a good friendship. Levin's brief was to write two columns a week (later three) on any subject that he wished. His range was prodigious; he published nine volumes of his selected journalism of which the first, Taking Sides, covered subjects {{as diverse as the}} death watch beetle, Field Marshal Montgomery, Wagner, homophobia, censorship, Eldridge Cleaver, arachniphobia, theatrical nudity, and the North Thames Gas Board.|$|E
5|$|Boniface was {{energetic}} {{in defending}} the liberties of his see, and clashed with King Henry over {{the election of}} Henry's clerk Robert Passelewe to the see of Chichester. Robert Grosseteste, the Bishop of Lincoln, had examined Passelewe, and found him unfit for episcopal office, and Boniface then quashed the election in 1244. He was also involved in disputes with the king's half-brothers, especially Aymer de Valence, who was Bishop of Winchester. He also quarrelled with his suffragan bishops, who resented his attempts to supervise their affairs <b>closely.</b> <b>In</b> 1250 Boniface attempted a visitation of his province, and this disturbed his suffragan bishops, who protested that Boniface was taking exorbitant amounts of money during his visits. They appealed to the pope, who reaffirmed the right of Boniface to conduct his visitation, but set a limit on the amount that could be taken from any monastery or church. After the visitation, Boniface left England again, and only returned in 1252, after the pope had decided the bishops' appeal in Boniface's favour. After his return, he continued to assert his rights and settled a number of disputes with his bishops. He secured professions of obedience from all but three of the 37 bishops consecrated during his time as archbishop. He also set up a court at Canterbury that heard appeals from the ecclesiastical courts of his suffragan bishops.|$|E
5|$|Broccoli had {{originally}} hired Richard Maibaum {{and his friend}} Wolf Mankowitz to write Dr. Nos screenplay, partly because of Mankowitz's help in brokering the deal between Broccoli and Saltzman. An initial draft of the screenplay was rejected because the scriptwriters had made the villain, Dr. No, a monkey. Mankowitz left the movie, and Maibaum then undertook a second version, more <b>closely</b> <b>in</b> line with the novel. Mankowitz eventually had his name removed from the credits after viewing early rushes, as he feared {{it would be a}} disaster. Johanna Harwood and thriller writer Berkely Mather then worked on Maibaum's script. Terence Young described Harwood as a script doctor who helped put elements more in tune with a British character. Harwood stated in an interview in a Cinema Retro special on the making of the film that she had been a screenwriter of several of Harry Saltzman's projects; and claimed both her screenplays for Dr. No and her screenplay for From Russia with Love had followed Fleming's novels closely.|$|E

5|$|John Marshall was {{the captain}} of the Van Diemen's Land team and William Philpott led the Port Phillip team, which batted first. The Victorian team found the home bowling {{difficult}} to face, on account of its unusually slow pace; in their first innings, they scored 82. Van Diemen's Land replied with 104, assisted by a large number of extras. The batsmen coped better than expected with the overarm bowling, although Thomas Antill took three wickets in four balls in returning figures of seven wickets for 33 runs. Batting again, the Victorian team scored 57, leaving the Tasmanian team needing 36 to win. When the first day's play ended due to bad light, Van Diemen's Land had scored 15 runs and lost six wickets. The next morning, the home team scored the required runs for the loss of one more wicket, recording a three-wicket victory. The match, which had been keenly anticipated, was a great attraction and was followed <b>closely</b> <b>in</b> the press in Melbourne. Additionally, there were many social events for the visiting team.|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} the {{starting}} grid, Carlos Sainz Jr. stopped on track and had to be pushed back to pit lane, where he eventually started, only to retire after just a few hundred metres. At the start, both Mercedes drivers got away well and Hamilton tried to overtake Rosberg for the lead around the outside of the first corner, but were unable to do so. Jenson Button made a good start, moving from 16th to 13th, while Marcus Ericsson fell from 13th to 18th. Behind the leaders, the Ferrari drivers retained third and fourth place respectively. Bottas moved into fifth after moving around the outside. Hamilton was able to follow Rosberg <b>closely</b> <b>in</b> the opening laps, while Daniel Ricciardo was the first driver to pit for new tyres on lap four. One lap later, Grosjean was able to use drag reduction system (DRS) to overtake Felipe Nasr for eleventh. With his back row start and an early pit stop, Ricciardo overtook the two Manor Marussia cars around lap nine.|$|E
5|$|The oldest known Japanese {{large-scale}} {{works are}} historical books (Kojiki and Nihon Shoki) or regional cultural and geographical records (fudoki) compiled on imperial {{order in the}} early 8th century. They were written {{with the aim of}} legitimizing the new centralized state under imperial rule by linking the origin of emperors to the Age of the Gods. The oldest of these historical books is the Kojiki ("Record of ancient matters") dating from 712 and composed by Ō no Yasumaro at the request of Empress Genmei. Written in ancient Japanese style using Chinese ideographs, it presents the mythological origin of Japan and historical events up to the year 628. Shortly after the completion of the Kojiki, the Nihon Shoki (or Nihongi) appeared in 720, probably originating to an order by Emperor Tenmu in 681. It is a much more detailed version of the Kojiki, dating events and providing alternative versions of myths; it covers the time up to 697. Compared to the Kojiki, it follows the model of Chinese dynastic histories more <b>closely</b> <b>in</b> style and language, using orthodox classical Chinese. Both of these works provide the historical and spiritual basis for shinto.|$|E

5|$|There is also {{a debate}} in the {{linguistic}} literature whether Greenlandic has noun incorporation. This is because Greenlandic does not allow the kind of incorporation common in many languages in which a noun root {{can be incorporated into}} almost any verb to form a verb with a new meaning. On the other hand, Greenlandic does often form verbs that include noun roots. The question then becomes whether to analyse these verb formations as incorporation or as denominal derivation of verbs. Greenlandic has a number of morphemes that require a noun root as their host and which form complex predicates that correspond <b>closely</b> <b>in</b> meaning to what is often seen in languages that have canonical noun incorporation. Linguists who propose that Greenlandic does have incorporation argue that these morphemes are in fact verbal roots that must obligatorily incorporate nouns to form grammatical clauses. This argument is supported by {{the fact that many of}} the derivational morphemes that form denominal verbs work almost identically to canonical noun incorporation. They allow the formation of words with a semantic content corresponding to an entire English clause with verb, subject and object. Another argument is that the morphemes used to derive denominal verbs come from historical noun incorporating constructions that have become fossilized. Other linguists maintain that the morphemes in question are simply derivational morphemes that allow the formation of denominal verbs. This argument is supported by the fact that the morphemes cannot occur without being latched on to a nominal element. The examples below illustrate how Greenlandic forms complex predicates including nominal roots.|$|E
