5|$|An {{inspection}} includes {{external and}} internal inspection for damage, <b>corrosion,</b> and correct colour and markings. The failure criteria {{vary according to the}} published standards of the relevant authority, but may include inspection for bulges, overheating, dents, gouges, electrical arc scars, pitting, line <b>corrosion,</b> general <b>corrosion,</b> cracks, thread damage, defacing of permanent markings, and colour coding.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} {{are more}} susceptible than aluminium to external <b>corrosion,</b> particularly in seawater, and may be galvanized or coated with <b>corrosion</b> barrier paints to resist <b>corrosion</b> damage. It {{is not difficult to}} monitor external <b>corrosion,</b> and repair the paint when damaged, and steel cylinders which are well maintained have a long service life, often longer than aluminium cylinders, as they are not susceptible to fatigue damage when filled within their safe working pressure limits.|$|E
5|$|As noted, the {{radioactive}} nature of technetium (3MBq/L at the concentrations required) makes this <b>corrosion</b> protection impractical {{in almost all}} situations. Nevertheless, <b>corrosion</b> protection by pertechnetate ions was proposed (but never adopted) for use in boiling water reactors.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} metals, if copper {{is put in}} contact with another metal, {{galvanic}} <b>corrosion</b> will occur.|$|E
5|$|<b>Corrosion</b> and {{chemical}} interactions had melded {{many of the}} metal artifacts into conglomerates.|$|E
5|$|<b>Corrosion</b> {{and heat}} {{resistance}} makes iridium an important alloying agent. Certain long-life aircraft engine parts {{are made of}} an iridium alloy, and an iridium–titanium alloy is used for deep-water pipes because of its <b>corrosion</b> resistance. Iridium is also used as a hardening agent in platinum alloys. The Vickers hardness of pure platinum is 56HV, whereas platinum with 50% of iridium can reach over 500HV.|$|E
5|$|<b>Corrosion,</b> {{due to a}} lack of maintenance, {{affected}} the seals of the hatch covers and the strength of the bulkheads which separate holds. The <b>corrosion</b> is difficult to detect due to the immense size of the surfaces involved.|$|E
5|$|Electrical contacts, {{where it}} is valued for small {{electrical}} resistance, small and stable contact resistance, and great <b>corrosion</b> resistance.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{cleaning}} of diving cylinders {{may be required}} to remove contaminants or to allow effective visual inspection. Cleaning methods should remove contaminants and <b>corrosion</b> products without undue removal of structural metal. Chemical cleaning using solvents, detergents and pickling agents may be used depending on the contaminant and cylinder material. Tumbling with abrasive media may be needed for heavy contamination, particularly of heavy <b>corrosion</b> products.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum is also {{valued in}} steel alloys for its high <b>corrosion</b> {{resistance}} and weldability. Molybdenum contributes <b>corrosion</b> resistance to type-300 stainless steels (specifically type-316) and especially {{so in the}} so-called superaustenitic stainless steels (such as alloy AL-6XN, 254SMO or 1925hMo). Molybdenum increases lattice strain, thus increasing the energy required to dissolve iron atoms from the surface. Molybdenum {{is also used to}} enhance the <b>corrosion</b> resistance of ferritic (for example grade 444) and martensitic (for example 1.4122 and 1.4418) stainless steels.|$|E
5|$|Noble metal, for metals {{that are}} {{resistant}} to <b>corrosion</b> or oxidation.|$|E
5|$|On March 8, 2013, the {{engineering}} firm NORR, {{commissioned by the}} Ontario Provincial Police, released {{the results of their}} forensic engineering investigation to the Elliot Lake Inquiry. The investigation found that the collapse was caused by a two-stage failure of the welding on a connection, due to extensive <b>corrosion.</b> The <b>corrosion</b> was caused by improper waterproofing and the placement of a parking lot on the roof, which allowed water, contaminated with road salt (which accelerated the <b>corrosion)</b> to corrode the structure.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium–uranium–titanium and plutonium–uranium–zirconium were {{investigated}} {{for use as}} nuclear fuels. The addition of the third element increases <b>corrosion</b> resistance, reduces flammability, and improves ductility, fabricability, strength, and thermal expansion. Plutonium–uranium–molybdenum has the best <b>corrosion</b> resistance, forming a protective film of oxides, but titanium and zirconium are preferred for physics reasons.|$|E
5|$|Sea water {{enters the}} forward hatch, {{due to a}} large wave, a poor seal, <b>corrosion,</b> etc.|$|E
5|$|Since 1 April 2006, the International Association of Classification Societies {{has adopted}} the Common Structural Rules. The rules apply to bulkers more than 90meters {{in length and}} require that scantlings' {{calculations}} take into account items such as the effect of <b>corrosion,</b> the harsh conditions often found in the North Atlantic, and dynamic stresses during loading. The rules also establish margins for <b>corrosion,</b> from 0.5 to 0.9mm.|$|E
5|$|The {{cylinder}} is inspected externally for dents, cracks, gouges, cuts, bulges, laminations {{and excessive}} wear, heat damage, torch or electric arc burns, <b>corrosion</b> damage, illegible, incorrect or unauthorised permanent stamp markings, and unauthorised additions or modifications. Unless the cylinder walls are examined by ultrasonic methods, the interior must be visually inspected using sufficient illumination {{to identify any}} damage and defects, particularly <b>corrosion.</b> If the inner surface is not clearly visible it should first be cleaned by an approved method which does not remove {{a significant amount of}} wall material. When there is uncertainty whether a defect found during visual inspection meets the rejection criteria, additional tests may be applied, such as ultrasonic measurement of pitting wall thickness, or weight checks to establish total weight lost to <b>corrosion.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{second largest}} {{application}} for manganese is in aluminum alloys. Aluminium with roughly 1.5% manganese has increased resistance to <b>corrosion</b> through grains that absorb impurities which {{would lead to}} galvanic <b>corrosion.</b> The corrosion-resistant aluminium alloys 3004 and 3104 (0.8 to 1.5% manganese) are used for most beverage cans. Before year 2000, more than 1.6 million tonnes of those alloys were used; at 1% manganese, this consumed 16,000 tonnes of manganese.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{hydrogen electrode}} also uses a platinized platinum electrode {{due to its}} <b>corrosion</b> resistance, and other attributes.|$|E
5|$|Used to {{test the}} pitting and crevice <b>corrosion</b> {{resistance}} of stainless steels and other alloys.|$|E
5|$|Vanadate can be {{used for}} {{protecting}} steel against rust and <b>corrosion</b> by conversion coating.|$|E
5|$|Vanadium traces in diesel fuels are {{the main}} fuel {{component}} in high temperature <b>corrosion.</b> During combustion, vanadium oxidizes and reacts with sodium and sulfur, yielding vanadate compounds with melting points as low as 530°C, which attack the passivation layer on steel and render it susceptible to <b>corrosion.</b> The solid vanadium compounds also abrade engine components.|$|E
5|$|This process {{occurs during}} the {{anaerobic}} <b>corrosion</b> {{of iron and}} steel in oxygen-free groundwater and in reducing soils below the water table.|$|E
25|$|Crevice <b>corrosion</b> is {{influenced}} by the crevice type (metal-metal, metal-nonmetal), crevice geometry (size, surface finish), and metallurgical and environmental factors. The susceptibility to crevice <b>corrosion</b> can be evaluated with ASTM standard procedures. A critical crevice <b>corrosion</b> temperature is commonly used to rank a material's resistance to crevice <b>corrosion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Measurements {{of stress}} <b>corrosion</b> and <b>corrosion</b> fatigue of light alloys.|$|E
25|$|Microbial <b>corrosion,</b> or {{commonly}} known as microbiologically influenced <b>corrosion</b> (MIC), is a <b>corrosion</b> caused or promoted by microorganisms, usually chemoautotrophs. It can apply to both metallic and non-metallic materials, in {{the presence or absence}} of oxygen. Sulfate-reducing bacteria are active in the absence of oxygen (anaerobic); they produce hydrogen sulfide, causing sulfide stress cracking. In the presence of oxygen (aerobic), some bacteria may directly oxidize iron to iron oxides and hydroxides, other bacteria oxidize sulfur and produce sulfuric acid causing biogenic sulfide <b>corrosion.</b> Concentration cells can form in the deposits of <b>corrosion</b> products, leading to localized <b>corrosion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Copper alloys used in {{sea water}} service have low general <b>corrosion</b> rates {{but also have}} a high {{resistance}} to many localized forms of <b>corrosion.</b> A technical discussion regarding various types of <b>corrosion,</b> application considerations (e.g., depth of installations, effect of polluted waters, sea conditions), and the <b>corrosion</b> characteristics of several copper alloys used in aquaculture netting is available (i.e., copper-nickel, copper-zinc, and copper-silicon).|$|E
25|$|<b>Corrosion</b> inhibitors {{are used}} to {{minimize}} the <b>corrosion</b> of steel and steel bars in concrete.|$|E
25|$|Chlorides, {{including}} sodium chloride, {{can promote}} the <b>corrosion</b> of embedded steel rebar if present in sufficiently high concentration. Chloride anions induce both localized <b>corrosion</b> (pitting <b>corrosion)</b> and generalized <b>corrosion</b> of steel reinforcements. For this reason, one should only use fresh raw water or potable water for mixing concrete, {{ensure that the}} coarse and fine aggregates do not contain chlorides, rather than admixtures which might contain chlorides.|$|E
25|$|The rate of <b>corrosion</b> {{protective}} {{formation is}} temperature dependent. For example, at 27°C (i.e., a common inlet {{temperature in the}} Middle East), rapid film formation and good <b>corrosion</b> protection can be expected within a few hours. At 16°C, it could take 2–3 months for the protection to mature. But once a good surface film forms, <b>corrosion</b> rates decrease, normally to 0.02–0.002mm/yr, as protective layers develop {{over a period of}} years. These alloys have good resistance to chloride pitting and crevice <b>corrosion</b> and are not susceptible to chloride stress <b>corrosion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Factors such as {{relative}} size of anode, {{types of}} metal, and operating conditions (temperature, humidity, salinity, etc.) affect galvanic <b>corrosion.</b> The surface area {{ratio of the}} anode and cathode directly affects the <b>corrosion</b> rates of the materials. Galvanic <b>corrosion</b> is often prevented {{by the use of}} sacrificial anodes.|$|E

25|$|Various {{treatments}} {{are used to}} slow <b>corrosion</b> damage to metallic objects which {{are exposed to the}} weather, salt water, acids, or other hostile environments. Some unprotected metallic alloys are extremely vulnerable to <b>corrosion,</b> such as those used in neodymium magnets, which can spall or crumble into powder even in dry, temperature-stable indoor environments unless properly treated to discourage <b>corrosion.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the human}} {{environment}}, biofilms can grow in showers very easily since {{they provide a}} moist and warm environment for the biofilm to thrive. Biofilms can form inside water and sewage pipes and cause clogging and <b>corrosion.</b> Biofilms on floors and counters can make sanitation difficult in food preparation areas. Biofilm in soil can cause bioclogging. Biofilms in cooling- or heating-water systems are known to reduce heat transfer. Biofilms in marine engineering systems, such as pipelines of the offshore oil and gas industry, can lead to substantial <b>corrosion</b> problems. <b>Corrosion</b> is mainly due to abiotic factors; however, at least 20% of <b>corrosion</b> is caused by microorganisms that {{are attached to the}} metal subsurface (i.e., microbially influenced <b>corrosion).</b>|$|E
25|$|To date, in over 10 {{years of}} {{aquaculture}} experience, chain link mesh fabricated by these brass alloys have not suffered from dezincification, stress <b>corrosion</b> cracking, or erosion <b>corrosion.</b>|$|E
25|$|As an {{architectural}} metal, copper provides excellent <b>corrosion</b> resistance. Copper surfaces form tough oxide-sulfate patina coatings that protect underlying copper surfaces and resist <b>corrosion</b> {{for a very}} long time.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to note that the <b>corrosion</b> of uranium dioxide in an aqueous environment is controlled by similar electrochemical processes to the galvanic <b>corrosion</b> of a metal surface.|$|E
