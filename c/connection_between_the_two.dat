5|$|Universal appealed, {{trying to}} prove {{consumer}} confusion by presenting {{the results of a}} telephone survey and examples from print media where people had allegedly assumed a <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> Kongs. On October 4, 1984, however, the court upheld the previous verdict.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} shared {{association}} with skiing {{and the fact}} that both place names referring to Ullr and Skaði appear most frequently in Sweden, some scholars have proposed a particular <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> gods. On the other hand, Skaði may potentially be a masculine form and, as a result, some scholars have theorized that Skaði may have originally been a male deity.|$|E
5|$|Further {{details about}} the {{expansion}} of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter were announced on May 8, 2013. Officials confirmed that the expansion would be set predominantly in the adjacent Universal Studios Florida theme park, and would feature attractions themed after Diagon Alley and London. The rumored Hogwarts Express <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> parks was also confirmed. Officials stated the expansion should open in 2014.|$|E
50|$|The {{three main}} {{blocks of the}} project are the Grid, the WEB2 and <b>the</b> <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> technologies.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} {{produced}} some 13 {{years prior to}} a Kingsley Amis novel The Green Man. There are no <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two.</b>|$|R
50|$|Confusion {{means that}} each binary digit (bit) of the {{ciphertext}} should depend on several {{parts of the}} key, obscuring <b>the</b> <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two.</b>|$|R
5|$|Henny Moan as Svea: Henny Moan {{plays the}} part of the old lady who owns the {{boarding}} house where Odd lives when he is in Bergen. There is a special <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two.</b> Moan has acted in films since 1955, and at the time O' Horten was made, she had just retired from a long career at the theatre.|$|E
5|$|This {{station is}} unusual in that its {{mezzanine}} is split in two halves. This is because at this location, Union Turnpike and the Jackie Robinson Parkway cross under Queens Boulevard but over the Queens Boulevard Line tracks; the mezzanine is {{at the level of}} Union Turnpike, one half on either side, with no <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> outside of fare control.|$|E
5|$|A {{transfer}} will {{be constructed}} {{at the eastern}} end of the 125th Street station to connect to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line's 125th Street station. A new lower-level mezzanine will house the <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> stations, directly connecting to the downtown platform for Lexington Avenue service. The direct connection to the staircases to the upper level will be rebuilt. At the western end of the station, a transfer will be built to connect to the Harlem–125th Street station of the Metro-North Railroad. An elevator, stairs, and escalators would connect the two stations.|$|E
5000|$|An {{engraving}} {{was published}} by Hendrick Goltzius of a design for a silver salver by Tetrode. Anthony Radcliffe explored possible <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> artists.|$|R
50|$|Geoff Wainwright and Timothy Darvill have contested Parker Pearson’s theories, however; {{they suggest}} that Stonehenge was a {{monument}} to healing and that <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> monuments were unlikely.|$|R
50|$|These direct {{telephone}} <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> {{halves of}} <b>the</b> island are {{operated by the}} United Nations exchange, which allows direct telephone calls <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> communities is in place since 4 May 1998.|$|R
5|$|In a {{telephone}} network, {{the caller is}} connected to the person they want to talk to by switches at various telephone exchanges. The switches form an electrical <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when the caller dials the number. Once the connection is made, the caller's voice is transformed to an electrical signal using a small microphone in the caller's handset. This electrical signal is then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is transformed back into sound by a small speaker in that person's handset.|$|E
5|$|Siward {{is perhaps}} most famous for his {{expedition}} in 1054 against Macbeth, King of Scotland, an expedition that cost Siward his eldest son, Osbjorn. The origin of Siward's conflict with the Scots is unclear. According to the Libellus de Exordio, in 1039 or 1040, the Scottish king Donnchad mac Crínáin attacked northern Northumbria and besieged Durham. Within a year, Mac Bethad had deposed and killed Donnchad. The failed siege occurred a year before Siward attacked and killed Earl Eadulf of Bamburgh, and though no <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> events is clear {{it is likely that}} they were linked.|$|E
5|$|The route intersects several long-distance highways, {{including}} NY13 in Dryden, U.S. Route20 (US20) and NY5 in Auburn, and NY31 in Port Byron. It {{passes over}} the New York State Thruway (Interstate90 or I-90) north of Port Byron; however, {{there is no}} <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two.</b> NY38 has two suffixed routes. The first, NY38A is an alternate route of NY38 between Moravia and Auburn, while the other, NY38B, is a simple east–west connector in the Southern Tier. While NY38 runs along the western shore of Owasco Lake, NY38A travels to Auburn along a routing east of the lake.|$|E
50|$|Oreshika: Tainted Bloodlines is set 100 {{years after}} its predecessor, with no direct story <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> games. <b>The</b> story {{is based on a}} cursed {{bloodline}} destined to fight against a demon.|$|R
50|$|Montdidier {{continues}} {{to be connected to}} Saint-Just-en-Chaussée and Roisel via TER Picardie coach service, but current timetables do not allow <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> lines which remain active (Montdidier - St Just and Amiens - Compiègne).|$|R
50|$|At 0714 UTC, Air India Flight 182 {{exploded}} in mid-air off {{the west coast}} of Ireland, falling into the sea. All 329 people on board were killed. Investigation by Canada has revealed <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> bombings.|$|R
5|$|The {{system is}} {{split into two}} parts, with lines north of Boston having a {{terminus}} at North Station and lines south of Boston having a terminus at South Station. There is no direct <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> stations, but travel is made possible by transferring to the MBTA's subway system (although this requires an intermediate transfer at either Park Street or Downtown Crossing) or the 4 bus. This lack of direct connection could be alleviated by the proposed (but currently shelved) North–South Rail Link, which would build a tunnel connecting the two terminals.|$|E
5|$|Non-human animals may {{experience}} both spontaneous and traumatic pneumothorax. Spontaneous pneumothorax is, as in humans, classified as primary or secondary, while traumatic pneumothorax {{is divided into}} open and closed (with or without chest wall damage). The diagnosis may be apparent to the veterinary physician because the animal exhibits difficulty breathing in, or has shallow breathing. Pneumothoraces may arise from lung lesions (such as bullae) or from trauma to the chest wall. In horses, traumatic pneumothorax may involve both hemithoraces, as the mediastinum is incomplete {{and there is a}} direct <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> halves of the chest. Tension pneumothorax – the presence of which may be suspected due to rapidly deteriorating heart function, absent lung sounds throughout the thorax, and a barrel-shaped chest – is treated with an incision in the animal's chest to relieve the pressure, followed by insertion of a chest tube.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{covers the}} story of Devil May Cry 4, and the events that {{happened}} before it. It expands Nero's backstory as it is revealed he was abandoned in Fortuna when he was baby. An unidentified character (strongly hinted to be Dante's brother Vergil) following Sparda's footsteps also appears in the novel first in a flashback when Nero was found in Fortuna {{as well as in}} a dream before Nero wields Yamato for the first time. During the novel Nero is often compared with Vergil; Dante is unable to understand the <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two.</b> The ending is also expanded as Nero opens his own demon hunting business after the Order of the Sword. In the afterword, Bingo wrote that these removed scenes were intended {{to be included in the}} game, but were not due to some production reasons.|$|E
50|$|Clipperstown {{station is}} within walking {{distance}} of (and clearly visible from) the larger Carrickfergus station, however road <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> are much more complicated. <b>The</b> timetable allows <b>two</b> minutes for <b>the</b> train to travel from Clipperstown to Carrickfergus.|$|R
50|$|The station sits just {{southeast}} {{from the}} Darby Transportation Center, a SEPTA bus and trolley terminal {{that is the}} terminus of Routes 11 and 13 of the SEPTA Subway-Surface Trolley Lines. There are no <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> stations.|$|R
5000|$|Hong Kong-Qatar {{relations}} {{refers to}} bilateral foreign relations between Hong Kong and Qatar. While both Qatar and Hong Kong are geographically small and in separate {{regions of the}} Asian continent, <b>the</b> <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> have a long history.|$|R
5|$|Tracks 1 and 3 are {{connected}} {{to each other and}} to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line's southbound local track south of Grand Central station. Track 4 connects to the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line's northbound local track north of Times Square station. There is no <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> tracks that connect to the Lexington Avenue Line, Tracks 1 and 3, and the track that connects to the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, Track 4; therefore, it is now physically impossible for a train to go from the IRT Lexington Avenue Line through to the IRT Seventh Avenue Line or vice versa by using the shuttle tracks. At the Times Square station, to provide a connection between the platform for Track 4 and the rest of the station complex, there is a pedestrian bridge over Track 4. The pedestrian bridge is temporary removed to allow the train on Track 4 to leave for maintenance.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{appears in}} his world, reunited with Alphonse and their friend Winry Rockbell, who fits Edward with new automail limbs. The Amestris {{military}} manages to stop most of Eckhart's soldiers {{with the help}} of Roy Mustang. Edward battles Eckhart before Alphonse transmutes parts of his soul to a group of armors, which attack her and force her to retreat. Upon reappearing in her own world, Eckhart is covered with shadow creatures from the Gate and killed by an officer out of alarm of her new, monstrous appearance. Understanding the danger posed by the <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> worlds, Edward returns to Earth to seal the Gate on the other side, knowing he will be trapped there forever. Instead of sealing the Gate on the other world's side as per Edward's request, however, Alphonse has Mustang seal the Gate and follows Edward to remain with his brother. Following Alfons' funeral, the Elric brothers leave Munich with Noah, intending to close the gate and destroy the weapons meant to be used in Hitler's attack. They enjoy their new lives together as they leave Germany with Noah, while on the Elric brothers homeworld, their friends go back to their normal lives.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 1.4 was {{released}} on May 28, 2009, and the first HDMI 1.4 products were available {{in the second half}} of 2009. HDMI 1.4 added support for 4K×2K, i.e. 4096×2160 at 24Hz (which is a resolution used with digital theaters), 3840×2160 (Ultra HD) at 24Hz/25Hz/30Hz, and support for 1080p at 120Hz. It also added an HDMI Ethernet Channel (HEC) which allows for a 100Mbit/s Ethernet <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> HDMI connected devices so they can share an Internet connection, introduced an audio return channel (ARC), 3D Over HDMI, a new Micro HDMI Connector, an expanded set of color spaces with the addition of sYCC601, Adobe RGB and Adobe YCC601, and an Automotive Connection System. HDMI 1.4 defined several stereoscopic 3D formats including field alternative (interlaced), frame packing (a full resolution top-bottom format), line alternative full, side-by-side half, side-by-side full, 2D + depth, and 2D + depth + graphics + graphics depth (WOWvx). HDMI 1.4 requires that 3D displays implement the frame packing 3D format at either 720p50 and 1080p24 or 720p60 and 1080p24. High Speed HDMI cables as defined in HDMI 1.3 work with all HDMI 1.4 features except for the HDMI Ethernet Channel, which requires the new High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet defined in HDMI 1.4.|$|E
5000|$|Lubec, from Béroalde de Verville's Le Moyen de parvenir, {{where the}} {{inhabitants}} have removable genitals (stored in the Town Hall). Moore explains {{that it was}} founded by inhabitants of Thermometer Island. There are no <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> works in reality.|$|R
50|$|Other {{significant}} <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> {{books include}} Book of Mormon {{words and phrases}} that only appear in their KJV usage, perpetuation of Bible passages considered by some scholars to have been mistranslated in the KJV, and the possible presence of English homophones.|$|R
5000|$|Miltonia {{looks more}} like Oncidiums than the other pansy orchids. The most [...] "pansy-like" [...] a Miltonia can get is the species Miltonia spectabilis. Taxonomists are debating whether to put Miltonia into the Oncidium genus because of <b>the</b> many <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two.</b>|$|R
5|$|Under an 1898 {{agreement}} between the Estates Company and the Ship Canal Company, the latter committed to carry freight on their dock railway between the docks and the park and {{to the construction of}} a permanent <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> railway networks. The West Manchester Light Railway Company was set up the following year to take over the operations of the tramway and to lay additional track. In 1904 responsibility for all of the parks roads and railways passed to the Trafford Park Company, {{as a result of the}} Trafford Park Act of that year. The railway network could subsequently be extended as required, without the need to seek additional permissions from Parliament. The network was also connected to the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway near Cornbrook. At its peak, the estate's railway network covered 26route miles (42km), handling about 2.5 million tons of cargo in 1940. Like the rest of the park, it fell into decline during the 1960s, exacerbated by the increasing use of road transport, and it was closed in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Uxmal is a Mayan {{city in the}} Puuc Hills of Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico. The Governor's Palace at Uxmal {{is often}} used as an exemplar of why it is {{important}} to combine ethnographic and alignment data. The palace is aligned with an azimuth of 118° on the pyramid of Cehtzuc. This alignment corresponds approximately to the southernmost rising and, with a much greater precision, to the northernmost setting of Venus; both phenomena occur once every eight years. By itself this would not be sufficient to argue for a meaningful <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> events. The palace has to be aligned in one direction or another and why should the rising of Venus be any more important than the rising of the Sun, Moon, other planets, Sirius et cetera? The answer given is that not only does the palace point towards significant points of Venus, it is also covered in glyphs which stand for Venus and Mayan zodiacal constellations. Moreover, the great northerly extremes of Venus always occur in late April or early May, coinciding with the onset of the rainy season. The Venus glyphs placed in the cheeks of the Maya rain god Chac, most likely referring to the concomitance of these phenomena, support the west-working orientation scheme.|$|E
25|$|Within {{electrochemical}} capacitors, the electrolyte is the conductive <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> electrodes, distinguishing {{them from}} electrolytic capacitors, {{in which the}} electrolyte only forms the cathode, the second electrode.|$|E
50|$|The Duna-Pogaya {{languages}} are a proposed small family of Trans-New Guinea languages in {{the classification of}} Voorhoeve (1975) and Ross (2005). However, <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> languages, Duna and Bogaya, are tenuous, and proposed connections to the larger Trans-New Guinea family are not convincing.|$|R
50|$|In type theory, some {{analogous}} notions {{are used}} as in mathematical logic (giving rise to <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> fields, e.g. Curry-Howard correspondence). The abstraction {{in the notion of}} judgment in mathematical logic can be exploited also in foundation of type theory as well.|$|R
50|$|Italy-Spain {{relations}} {{refers to}} interstate relations between Italy and Spain. Both countries established diplomatic relations after {{the unification of}} Italy. Relations between Italy and Spain have remained strong and affable for centuries owing to various political, cultural, and historical <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> nations.|$|R
