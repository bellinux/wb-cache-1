40|$|The {{bitter taste}} of olives is {{mainly caused by}} the {{phenolic}} compound named oleuropein and the mechanism of its hydrolysis during the processing of <b>natural</b> <b>green</b> olives was studied. First, a rapid chemical hydrolysis of oleuropein takes place at a high temperature of 40 °C and at a low pH value of 2. 8, but the chemical hydrolysis of the bitter compound is slow at the common range of pH for these olives (3. 8 - 4. 2). However, decarboxymethyl elenolic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol and hydroxytyrosol {{have been found in}} a high concentration during the elaboration of <b>natural</b> <b>green</b> olives. When olives were heated at 90 °C for 10 min before brining, these compounds are not formed. Hence, the debittering process in <b>natural</b> <b>green</b> olives is due to the activity of β-glucosidase and esterase during the first months of storage and then a slow chemical hydrolysis of oleuropein happens throughout storage time.
