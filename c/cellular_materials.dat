The observation and the analysis of physical phenomenon is the first step of the multi scale modeling. This paper describes the experimental and numerical methods used to observe and describe the structure of the <b>cellular</b> <b>material,</b> and quantify deformations and damages of these structures at the scales of beads and cells.
