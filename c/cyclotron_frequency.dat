We present here {{the results of}} a detailed analysis of the magnetic field fluctuations observed downstream of the shock. We use data from the four Cluster spacecraft to determine the behavior and the geometry of these fluctuations with good accuracy. Shortly after the ramp crossing, we observed a large-amplitude nonlinear Alfvén wave, propagating along the downstream average magnetic field with a spectrum peaking at two frequencies below the proton and the alpha ion <b>cyclotron</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Farther downstream in the magnetosheath the magnetic field fluctuations took the form of three-dimensional structures which can be interpreted as cylindrical field-aligned current tubes.
