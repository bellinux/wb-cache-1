5|$|Farmer {{worked in}} Los Angeles {{for a time}} as a hotel janitor and a {{hospital}} file clerk, before joining Lionel Hampton's orchestra in 1952. He toured Europe with the orchestra, and shared the organization's trumpet <b>chairs</b> <b>with</b> Clifford Brown, Quincy Jones and Benny Bailey. This aided his musical development considerably, as did his 1953 membership of Teddy Charles' New Directions band – the compositions he encountered in this band allowed him to consider {{a broader range of}} expression during improvisation.|$|E
5|$|Leather was not {{infrequently}} used {{even for}} the costly and elaborate chairs of the faldstool form—occasionally sheathed in thin plates of silver—which Venice sent all over Europe. To this day, indeed, leather {{is one of the}} most frequently employed materials for chair covering. The outstanding characteristic of most chairs until the middle of the 17th century was massiveness and solidity. Being usually made of oak, they were of considerable weight, and it was not until the introduction of the handsome Louis XIII <b>chairs</b> <b>with</b> cane backs and seats that either weight or solidity was reduced.|$|E
5|$|The 200 {{guest rooms}} of the {{original}} hotel were divided into four two-story motel wings, each with fifty rooms, and named after famous race tracks. They were set out in a hacienda style, and surrounded by a half-moon shaped pool. The suites were luxuriously designed. Plush blue carpets and ivory colored <b>chairs</b> <b>with</b> white ceilings were the norm in the early days. An electric tram service, often attended by pretty showgirls, took the guests to their rooms. A 14-story tower commenced construction in late 1965, and was opened in 1967. It existed until November 1996 when it was demolished.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a Six Sides of Steel Weapons {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship, pitting the {{champion}} Samoa Joe against the challenger Booker T, who was accompanied by Sharmell. The duration of the contest was 12 minutes and 44 seconds. Early in the bout, Booker T hit Joe {{in the face with}} a steel chair, resulting in Joe bleeding from the forehead. Later on, Booker T slammed Joe back-first onto two <b>chairs</b> <b>with</b> his signature Book End maneuver, however, Joe kicked out of a pinfall attempt. Joe gained the pinfall victory to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship after bashing Booker T over the head with a guitar that had appeared in the ring after the lights had suddenly went off and back on.|$|E
5|$|The room to {{the east}} of the Oak Bedroom is known as The Great Room. The room was {{established}} in the mid 17th century as part of a reception suite, and was used by George John, the Second Earl for important political conferences during his period as First Lord of the Admiralty and Home Secretary. The Great Room, predominantly red and gold in design like many of the first floor rooms, contains a table and <b>chairs</b> <b>with</b> a large gilded mirror with three urns in front of it. The long mirror, designed by James Stuart, who was noted for his Athenian designs, features a tableaux at the top with the Spencer coat of arms and the pulling of chariots by cherubs, representing the love between John and Georgiana. The Great Room contains an extensive collection of miniature portraits, including a very rare Lucas de Heere portrait of Lady Jane Grey as a teenage girl at her family residence in Bradgate, Leicestershire. The Portrait of Isaak Abrahamsz. Massa is mentioned in the 1822 Bibliotheca Spenceriana as hanging in one of the bedrooms at Althorp. It was sold in 1924 to art merchant Joseph Duveen, who sold it the following year to Canadian businessman Frank P. Wood.|$|E

25|$|The Kennedys often {{provided}} {{entertainment in}} the East Room after formal dinners, which necessitated finding seating for these events.

25|$|Kingswood's Church of Jesus Christ and the Wisdom of God, much {{of which}} was {{formerly}} {{one of the two}} early St Sophia's (Greek Orthodox) Churches in London, marks the start of Buckland Road and is a Grade I listed building on architecture, it features red brick and stone in various patterns e.g. chequer work, herringbone and basketweave; exotic marble and other stone, nine imported corinthian capitals from Turkey, Arts and Crafts movement lectern, pulpit and reading desk, in ebony and holly with mother of pearl inlay, priests' <b>chairs</b> <b>with</b> domed canopies, Byzantine capitals from Constantinople and Ephesus decorate the aisles and west wall.|$|E
25|$|As a consequence, certain traditions {{stated that}} popes {{throughout}} the medieval period {{were required to}} undergo a procedure wherein they sat on a special chair {{with a hole in}} the seat. A cardinal would have the task of putting his hand up the hole to check whether the pope had testicles, or doing a visual examination. This procedure is not taken seriously by most historians, and there is no documented instance. It is probably a scurrilous legend based on the existence of two ancient stone <b>chairs</b> <b>with</b> holes in the seats that probably dated from Roman times and may have been used because of their ancient imperial origins. Their original purpose is obscure.|$|E

25|$|In March 1941 Tejada won {{the contest}} for chair of Derecho Natural y Filosofía del Derecho in Murcia; in 1942 {{he moved to}} Salamanca, having been the only contender. In 1951 he swapped <b>chairs</b> <b>with</b> Joaquín Ruiz Giménez Cortés and left for Seville, where he headed {{philosophy}} of law for the next 26 years, periodically chairing also the history of ideas. However, except the 1960-1961 course he spent the 1956-1964 period mostly pursuing research in Naples, with massive admin gimmicks on part of the University to find a legal framework for such a lengthy stay. Since 1964 he worked under the dedicación exclusiva contract. In 1969 nominated consejero honorario del Consejo Nacional de Educación, though his academic relations with the Francoist education authorities remained thorny.|$|E
25|$|In a {{separate}} initiative not {{funded by the}} U.S. Department of Defense, clinical trials at an infectious disease outpatient ward consisting of patients with HIV and other infectious diseases are being conducted at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York. An alloy of 90% Cu 10% Ni significantly lowered the microbial burden, primarily Staphylococci, on arm surfaces of phlebotomy chairs versus wooden arm surfaces. The median reduction for total bacteria on the copper alloy chairs arms was 90%. Use of the chair with copper arm tops resulted in a 17-fold lower risk of exposure to environmental microbes than when patients used the standard chair. The majority of the samples from the <b>chairs</b> <b>with</b> copper components were below the 500CFU/cm2 level believed to represent a risk to hospital patients.|$|E
40|$|The {{studies of}} office chair constructions have {{identified}} differences in perception of comfort provided by {{different types of}} seats. Four seat constructions and the comfort provided to the users were compared by means of subjective indicators. After a two-day sitting {{on each of the}} studied chairs, the subjects scored their perception of comfort and discomfort, using the questionnaire with 17 statements. Unlike most similar studies, subjects evaluated seats on their own work places and in the environment to which they are accustomed. Constructional forms of the seat and materials that contributed more to the sense of comfort by minimizing fatigue and pains developed by sitting were determined. Results have shown that the <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> a net is significantly more comfortable than other <b>chairs.</b> The <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> molded PU foam is significantly more comfortable than the <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> springs, but statistically it does not differ significantly from the <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> slabstock PU foam. It has been concluded that the <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> a net got higher scores, which might be attributed to its frame construction and the absence of a hard base under the sitting surface...|$|R
