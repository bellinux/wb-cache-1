5000|$|Normally, birds adapt {{within weeks}} of {{exposure}} to bird control devices that are not alive or an actual threat to their survival. Such bird control devices that birds habituate to within weeks include sound devices, mechanical devices, wind blown scare devices, and partial perch modifications.

This is why netting, mesh, and low current electrical barriers are tested to be the most effective avian control devices.

5000|$|In nuclear strategy, a {{counterforce}} {{target is}} one that has a military value, such as a launch silo for intercontinental ballistic missiles, an airbase at which nuclear-armed bombers are stationed, a homeport for ballistic missile submarines, or a command and <b>control</b> <b>installation.</b> [...] The intent of a counterforce strategy (i.e., attacking counterforce targets with nuclear weapons) is to disarm an adversary by destroying its nuclear weapons before they can be launched, thereby minimizing the impact of a retaliatory second strike. However, counterforce attacks are also possible in a second strike, especially with weapons like UGM-133 Trident II. A counterforce target is distinguished from a countervalue target, which includes an adversary's population, knowledge, economic, or political resources. [...] In other words, a counterforce strike is against an adversary's military while a countervalue strike is against an adversary's cities. A closely related tactic is the decapitation strike, which by destroying an enemy's nuclear command and control facilities similarly intends to eliminate or reduce their ability to launch a second strike.|$|E
50|$|Platform 7 is disused and {{the line}} is covered by vegetation. However, with the planned two-year {{blockade}} of Thameslink trains through Central London while London Bridge station is under reconstruction Network Rail considered reinstating and electrifying this line as a 'dead-end'. The object was to terminate some additional services arriving via Crystal Palace which would otherwise need {{to go on to}} Beckenham Junction to terminate, thus obviating unnecessary occupation of the 1¾ miles of single bi-directional line east of Birkbeck Junction and also save a carriage set. To achieve the change the lead to the down spur at Bromley Junction would have been being removed to the up line and a facing crossover put into place west of it. To provide the necessary pathing northbound the trains would use the same spur line, which would have become reversible to the resited point on the up line at Bromley Junction. Despite safety problems for the user-operated level crossing into the track maintenance depot on the former steam shed site because of restricted sighting under Goat House bridge having apparently been resolved the changes have been postponed until the work at London Bridge is complete. This is mainly because it was judged the cost did not justify the change, at least until a general renewal of the signal and <b>control</b> <b>installation</b> is undertaken.|$|E
40|$|A single master air {{pressure}} controller for several machines can reduce {{air pressure}} variation {{by having a}} single set-point for all machines. This master control when coupled to a sequencing control package allows positively loading the combination of air compressors in the most efficient manner for any air demand. This system can be further enhanced {{by the addition of}} a remote set point signal based on air-flow. This signal is calibrated to reduce the set-point during periods of low demand when the pressure drop is a minimum.

5000|$|Back in {{a civilized}} area, Caleb {{has a new}} objective: Cerberus (resembling Orthrus), now Tchernobog's second in command, must be eliminated. The first section of the episode {{consists}} of a town that has fallen under heavy airborne bombing; few {{still live in the}} place, aside from the Cabal and its minions. Leaving behind the meat processing plant and the city hall, Caleb enters the sewers to reach {{the other side of the}} war-battered city. Emerging to the surface, the entrance of a hospital lies ahead: the interior contains patient rooms, chapel, a morgue, an [...] "assisted suicide" [...] room, and a baby carriage with a demonic hand sticking out of it as a tribute to It's Alive!. From the chapel, access to the catacombs (secret level) can also be gained. Once outside the hospital, Caleb moves across an industrial facility, entering a nearby dam <b>control</b> <b>installation</b> located close to Cerberus' cavern. Caleb struggles his way through a difficult [...] "combo lock" [...] puzzle, then blows up the dam with explosives. The resulting flood makes it possible to access the demon's fiery hideout. Several seals, guarded by Hellhounds, must be unlocked before Cerberus makes his furious appearance from behind the stone walls. The two-headed beast does not prove a match for Caleb, who then fills the creature's stomach with many remote-controlled bundles of TNT and blows up the corpse, causing it to rain red over Caleb.|$|E

40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this study to {{demonstrate}} the viability and economy of Design- of-Experiments (DOE), to arrive at micro-secondary flow <b>control</b> <b>installation</b> designs that achieve optimal inlet performance for different mission strategies. These statistical design concepts were used to investigate the properties of "low unit strength" micro-effector installation. "Low unit strength" micro-effectors are micro-vanes, set a very low angle-of incidence, with very long chord lengths. They are designed to influence the neat wall inlet flow over an extended streamwise distance. In this study, however, the long chord lengths were replicated by a series of short chord length effectors arranged in series over multiple bands of effectors. In order to properly evaluate the performance differences between the single band extended chord length installation designs and the segmented multiband short chord length designs, both sets of installations must be optimal. Critical to achieving optimal micro-secondary flow <b>control</b> <b>installation</b> designs is the understanding of the factor interactions that occur between the multiple bands of micro-scale vane effectors. These factor interactions are best understood and brought together in an optimal manner through a structured DOE process, or more specifically Response Surface Methods (RSM) ...|$|E
