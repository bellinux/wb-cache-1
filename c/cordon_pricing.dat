However, it appears that many cities will wish to rely on cordon and area-based schemes [40] which have the merit of being simple to understand.

40|$|Congestion pricing {{strategy}} has been recognized as an effective countermeasure in the practical field of urban traffic congestion mitigation. Despite {{the positive effects of}} congestion pricing, its implementation has faced problems. This paper investigates the issue of environmental equity in <b>cordon</b> <b>pricing</b> and a park-and-ride scheme. Although pollution decreases inside the cordon by implementation of <b>cordon</b> <b>pricing,</b> air pollutants emission may increase in some links and in the whole network. Therefore, an increase in air emissions in the network means more emission outside the cordon. In fact, due to the implementation of this policy, air pollutants emission may transfer from inside to outside the cordon, creating a type of environmental inequity. To reduce this inequity, a bi-level optimization model with an equity constraint is developed. The proposed solution algorithm based on the second version of the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA 2) is applied to the city network in Tehran. The results revealed that it seems reasonable to consider environmental equity as an objective function in <b>cordon</b> <b>pricing.</b> In addition, we can create a sustainable situation for the transportation system by improving environmental inequity with a relatively low reduction in social welfare. Moreover, there are environmental inequity impacts in real networks, which should be considered in the <b>cordon</b> <b>pricing</b> scheme...|$|E

30|$|High {{levels of}} traffic in {{metropolis}} areas {{have become a}} critical social problem of the twenty-first century. Congestion pricing, as part of traffic demand management (TDM) strategies, is a significant economic tool which has been implemented in several cities around the world [1]. It mitigates the congestion level by encouraging the commuters enough to alter their behavior, such as their departure time, route or mode of transport [2, 3]. Congestion pricing schemes can be categorized into two groups: the first-best and the second-best strategies. In the first-best strategy, the well-known Pigouvian formula [4] {{is used to calculate}} the negative externalities which should be paid by the drivers. It is applied by charging tolls over all links of the network, so that the user equilibrium flow pattern shifts toward a socially preferred pattern. However, this is not a practical strategy, because of the political and social resistance against all roads tolled. On the other hand, the second-best policy is more acceptable to the public since it settles charges on a limited subset of the links. First applied in Singapore in 1975, <b>cordon</b> <b>pricing</b> is the most appropriate second-best policy for network authorities due to its practicality, effectiveness and social acceptance. <b>Cordon</b> <b>pricing</b> follows three main objectives in general: alleviating congestion, enhancing the environmental indices and generating revenue [5]. In the conventional form of <b>cordon</b> <b>pricing,</b> the commuters are charged on entry into a specific zone, enclosed by a hypothetical cordon line. Mostly implemented on the central business districts, this second-best strategy can reduce the intensity of congestion within the cordoned area by deflecting the routes from entry or changing the mode of transport. May et al. [6], Shepherd et al. [7, 8], Santos et al. [9], May et al. [10], Zhang and Yang [11] and Gholami et al. [12] are among those who investigated the impact of the entry-based <b>cordon</b> <b>pricing</b> on the performance of transportation systems. Although a single layer cordon has a positive effect on reducing the congestion inside, it may cause unwilling congestion outside the cordoned area. In order to tackle this deficiency, some researchers suggested that using multilayer cordons can improve the geographical coverage of <b>cordon</b> <b>pricing</b> [10, 12, 13]. May et al. [10], Zou et al. [14] and Gholami et al. [12] argued against <b>cordon</b> <b>pricing</b> by showing that there may exist more effective toll points in the whole network than on the cordon line, providing that the total number of tolled links is not changed. Based on their experiments, relaxing the constraint of keeping the cordon line closed can increase the social benefits of community. However, implementation of such a strategy encounters practical issues since it does not form a coherent geographical district and is mentally hard to be perceived and accepted by the users. May et al. [6] pointed out that <b>cordon</b> <b>pricing</b> can affect only the trips with the origins outside and the destinations inside the cordoned area. They implemented a bidirectional charging plan which can enhance the overall performance of the pricing.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the possibility of a <b>cordon</b> area <b>pricing</b> scheme in an inversion prone area to reduce fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) production and to give decision makers more options when it comes to reducing pollution. This project presents a case study in Cache County, Utah to determine the impact that a cordon area-pricing scheme would have in reducing the pollution. Cache Metropolitan Planning Organization (CMPO) provided a CUBE Voyager model of the county that was used and changed to measure vehicle miles travelled (VMT) from different scenarios for the years 2010, 2020, 2030, and 2035. A literature review was done on other <b>cordon</b> area <b>pricing</b> schemes {{from around the world to}} compare and use similar number in the modeling. Then the VMT was used to measure emissions using the emission rates from the CMPO’s MOBILE 6. 2 emissions model for all years. This project explains how the CUBE Voyager model of Cache County was developed and which parts were changed to model a cordon area-pricing scheme. The script file in the highway assignment section of the model was changed and only the external trips were reduced. The model has two different classifications of vehicles, long and short, that were changed differently for each scenario. There were four scenarios run in the model with two different types of data sets. Scenario 1 was a “do nothing” scenario that was run without any changes in the model and used as a base for comparison for the other scenarios. Scenario 2 was to reduce the external trips for both long and short vehicle trips by 20 %. Scenario 3 was to reduce long vehicle external trips by 50 % and short vehicle external trips by 20 %. Scenario 4 was to reduce the long vehicle external trips by 100 % and the short vehicle external trips by 20 %. The two different types of data sets was one with the 2010 network used for all years denoted as a “No Build” network and the other used the data with each phase of highway capacity projects completed denoted as “With Phases. ” The pollution reduction for all the scenarios was analyzed and recommendations were given...|$|R

40|$|The City of Toronto {{has done}} much to reduce {{congestion}} through transportation system management and travel demand measures. Yet, while measures to eliminate the traffic congestion problem have been necessary, they simply have not been sufficient to accommodate over 2. 5 million residents and the many more who {{find their way into}} the area from points beyond particularly from other regions in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). In addition, the transportation improvements certainly do not provide capacity adequate {{to address the needs of}} the future predicted residents and added economic activity. Congestion pricing is an untapped transportation strategy that can reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and raise the revenue essential to implement needed transportation measures that are effective in improving transportation services and facilities. While experience with congestion pricing is limited, there are sufficient examples and experiences around the world to demonstrate that, when implemented properly, it virtually never fails to be an effective tool to curb congestion. Yet, when initially proposed, it never fails to be controversial. This is due in part to the lack of research on the equity impacts on different socio-economic groups. This is the dichotomy and the dilemma of congestion pricing that every city must face in seeking this new approach to congestion management. The main goal of the research is to provide empirical research that enhances our understanding of the equity implications of <b>cordon</b> <b>pricing</b> for the urban region of Toronto, Canada. Three research objectives are identified to address the research goal. The first objective is to examine the ways that the GTA is moving toward or away the principles of sustainable transportation, and thus to make a case that Downtown Toronto is a candidate for <b>cordon</b> <b>pricing.</b> The second objective is to investigate if particular socio-economic groups would be disproportionately affected by the implementation of <b>cordon</b> <b>pricing</b> in Downtown Toronto, as one way of approaching the equity dimensions of such a policy. The third objective is to explore some of the policy aspects associated with implementing <b>cordon</b> <b>pricing</b> in Toronto, including public perceptions of such a policy as well as probable responses to the policy. The major findings of this analysis are that the GTA is not moving in the direction of sustainable transportation, which provides a concrete justification for demand-management interventions and that Downtown Toronto is a candidate for <b>cordon</b> <b>pricing.</b> A Downtown Toronto <b>cordon</b> <b>pricing</b> scheme would be progressive in its effects on the various socio-economic groups, and that the progressivity holds up even when travel is disaggregated by demographic factors such as age, gender, household size and occupational category. Full-time workers account for a larger proportion of the affected trips and the percentage of trips that would be affected is highest for those in the full-time high-income neighborhoods. The analyses show that toll charge is an important factor that would trigger some income groups to change their travel behaviour. People from high-income neighborhoods are more willing to pay the charges and drive as usual than people from other income neighborhoods.

The problem with this political gesture is that neoliberals are lukewarm to redistributive politics and consider spatial mobility {{to be a matter of}} capacity and not a right. This means that neoliberal political parties because of their skepticism of redistributive politics, have more difficulties in imposing congestion pricing schemes than Left Parties.

40|$|In {{recent years}} several European cities have {{introduced}} road pricing {{as a tool}} for managing transport demand, especially to reduce traffic congestion and rebalance the modal split between private vehicles and mass-transit systems. Indeed, user behaviour brings about a User Equilibrium condition which does not correspond to the overall utility maximisation and does not take account of external costs. Hence, in order to achieve the efficient use of transportation systems (System Equilibrium), tolls can be charged on urban roads so that the social surplus is maximised. For several reasons (theoretical, political, social acceptability) it is impossible to charge 'efficient tolls' (first-best solutions) proposed in the literature; therefore in real networks sub-optimal tolls (second-best solutions) are applied. Road pricing application involves many political and social issues to be solved by policy makers, such as what to do with road pricing revenues. This aspect is analysed in this paper. In particular, we formulate a toll computation model according to economic theory; the model is then applied in a trial network to analyse several second-best strategies (such as <b>cordon</b> and parking <b>pricing)</b> and estimate possible effects of road pricing revenues use on social welfare and fare levels...|$|R

However, different individual daily trip purposes, city development, variations in land use and different levels of decision making about transportation often lead to the implementation of more than one TDM policy at a time. This study examined the role of TDM policy interactions on the macro and micro levels. On the macro level, this study showed that the introduction of two-way interactions in the model could improve the goodness of fit by 15 %. On the micro level, we developed the concept of synergy for all levels of two policies. The results show that generally synergy is a function of policies’ levels, and the {{integration of}} increasing parking cost with either <b>cordon</b> <b>pricing</b> or increasing fuel cost has greater synergy at higher levels of the two policies. In contrast, the integration of other two policies (i. e. <b>cordon</b> <b>pricing</b> and increasing fuel cost) had no synergy in the examined ranges...|$|E

40|$|As {{congestion}} pricing {{has moved from}} theoretical ideas in the literature to real world implementations, the need for decision support when designing the pricing schemes has become evident. This paper deals {{with the problem of}} finding optimal toll levels and locations in a road traffic network, and presents a case study of Stockholm. The optimization problem of finding optimal toll levels, given a predetermined cordon, and the problem of finding both optimal toll locations and levels are presented, and previously developed heuristics are used for solving these problems. For the Stockholm case study, the possible welfare gains of optimizing the toll levels in the current cordon, and optimizing both the toll locations and their corresponding toll levels are evaluated. It is shownthat by tuning the toll levels in the current congestion <b>pricing</b> <b>cordon</b> used in Stockholm, the welfare gain can be significantly increased, and furthermore improved by allowing a toll on the bypass highway “Essingeleden”. It is also shown that by optimizing both the toll locations and levels, a {{congestion pricing}} scheme with welfare gain close to what can be achieved by marginal social cost pricing, can be designed with tolls being located on only a forth of the tollable links.

40|$|The paper {{develops}} {{a set of}} analytical formulations to study {{the behavior of the}} urban delivery industry in response to <b>cordon</b> time-of-day <b>pricing,</b> time-distance pricing, and comprehensive financial policies targeting carriers and receivers. This is accomplished by modeling the behavior of receivers in response to financial incentives, and the ensuing behavior of the carrier in response to both pricing and the receivers' decisions concerning off-hour deliveries. The analytical formulations consider both the base case condition, and a mixed operation with both regular hour and off-hour deliveries; two <b>pricing</b> schemes: <b>cordon</b> time of day, and time-distance pricing; two types of operations: single-tour, and multi-tour carriers; and three different scenarios in terms of profitability of the carrier operation, which include an approximation to the best case, the expected value, and the worst case. The analyses, both theoretical and numerical, highlight the limitations of pricing-only approaches. In the case of cordon time of day pricing, the chief conclusion is that it is of limited use as a freight demand management tool because: (1) in a competitive market the cordon toll cannot be transferred to the receivers as it is a fixed cost and (2) the structure of the cost function, that only provides an incentive to the carrier to switch to the off-hours when all the receivers in the tour switch to the off-hours. The analyses of time-distance pricing clearly indicate that, though its tolls could be transferred to the receivers and provide an incentive for behavior change, the magnitude of the expected toll transfers under real life conditions are too small to have any meaningful impact on receivers choice of delivery times. In essence, the key policy implication is that in order to change the joint behavior of carrier and receivers, financial incentives [...] or programs that foster unassisted off-hour deliveries [...] should be made available to receivers in exchange for their commitment to do off-hour deliveries. As the paper proves, if a meaningful number of receivers switch to the off-hours, the carriers are likely to follow suit.

30|$|Transportation demand {{management}} (TDM) covers strategies for reducing traffic congestion within the affected urban areas. Congestion pricing includes {{a branch of}} TDM strategies; among them, the entry-based <b>cordon</b> <b>pricing,</b> i.e., applying charge on entry, {{is the most popular}} because of practicality and social acceptance. Many researchers have investigated different second-best approaches for evaluations of <b>cordon</b> <b>pricing</b> plans, mostly by applying static traffic assignment methods. In this paper, a joint entry- and distance-based scheme is proposed to circumvent the deficiencies intrinsic to each. The optimal joint design is considered as the solution to an optimization problem, in which an equilibrium dynamic traffic assignment model is used to take account of flow variations and represent congestion effects more realistically. The problem is solved for the network of Sioux Falls by using an enumeration algorithm, and the solution is compared with those obtained for distinct entry- and distance-based schemes. Based on the results, the joint tolling has the best performance in reducing the total travel time of the travelers and in alleviating the congestion level inside the cordoned area, while generating a higher level of revenue from tolls. Furthermore, the numerical experiments show the unreliability of the results by static against dynamic modeling approach.|$|E

In this paper, we evaluate the impact of setting up urban tolls on several inequalities indicators. We simulate a <b>cordon</b> <b>pricing</b> with different levels of prices and evaluate its impacts on inequalities using both income and accessibility indices. We adopt a comparison-based approach to reduce the bias resulting from the spatial division. In agreement with the literature, we show that introducing a toll increases inequalities. The greatest increases in inequality are located in both the most central zones (within the boundary), the inner or the outer ring where the timesavings do not offset the increase in travel cost. For spatial inequalities, although we observe an improvement of accessibility, particularly for central zones, the first ring (adjacent to the toll zone) is the most adversely affected by the toll...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWith the aim {{of making}} a city sustainable, this paper evaluates the impact of setting up urban toll on inequalities. We use several {{indicators}} (Gini, Theil and Atkinson indices) to measure changes in the concentration of incomes and gravity-based accessibility. In {{the case of the}} Lyon Metropolitan Area (France), we simulate a <b>cordon</b> <b>pricing</b> and evaluate its impacts on inequalities. We adopt a comparison-based approach to reduce the bias resulting from the spatial division. In agreement with the literature, we show that different inequality indicators produce contrasted and sometimes contradictory results, both at the scale of zones or metropolitan level. Results from Theil and Atkinson indicators point out introducing a toll can reduce inequalities in the most peripheral zones. Although we observe an accessibility improvement, particularly for central zones, the first ring (adjacent to the toll zone) is the most adversely affected by toll...|$|E
