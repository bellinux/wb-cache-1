These developments require new materials such as electroconductive textiles. As a result, research into screen printing of conductive silver inks onto textiles has emerged. In this study, screen printing is used to print four kinds of silver-based conductive inks on a flexible foam and a nonwoven substrate. The screen printing method is chosen because it is a low cost and user friendly technique to obtain flexible and lightweight conductive fabrics. For the evaluation of the electrical properties the square resistance of the printed fabrics is measured after repeated dry <b>cleaning</b> <b>cycles.</b> The printed textiles studied here show good electrical properties after printing (< 0. 05 /«).

40|$|In this paper, a multi-objective {{control system}} has been {{developed}} and experimentally tested. The multi-objective control system can be effectively used to control short-term fouling as well as long-term fouling. In an earlier Study {{it was found that}} coagulant dosing in ultrafiltration can be used effectively to control the short-term fouling resistance during several sequential filtration cycles. To control long-term resistance increase during sequential chemical <b>cleaning</b> <b>cycles,</b> usually, in open-loop setting of the cleaning frequency or variables which influence the cleaning efficiency, such as, the cleaning time and the chemical composition are adjusted. Additional introductory experiments showed that changes in the coagulant dosing have a more pronounced effect on long-term fouling than changes in the usual applied variables. For this reason, it was decided to develop a closed-loop multi-objective controller where the coagulant dosing is used as the manipulated variable to accomplish both control objectives namely the fouling resistance over multiple filtration cycles (the short-term objective), as well as the irreversible fouling resistance over multiple chemical <b>cleaning</b> <b>cycles</b> (long-term objective). However, the controller is too slow to deal with temperature changes influencing the effectiveness of the coagulant dosing.

40|$|In this study, {{the shape}} {{behavior}} of complete dentures in household dishwashers was investigated. The ulterior motive {{was to establish}} an improved and simpler method of cleaning dentures in geriatric institutions. For {{the investigation of the}} shape behavior, a method involving digital 3 -D measuring technique was used, which was modified to meet the specific requirements. It was shown that the digital 3 -D measuring technique is suitable for the evaluation of the shape behavior of complete dentures. For the entire test assembly, the average deviation was ± 19 µm. For the investigation, stylized maxillary dentures without tooth arch were fabricated of heat-curing and cold-curing polymer. All denture bases were stored in tap water at 37 °C for three weeks. After that, some dentures of each material group were washed in a common household dishwasher twice a day, in addition to the water storage. The dentures were subject to a total of 81 dishwasher <b>cleaning</b> <b>cycles.</b> Digital data records were collected by means of optical recording of the internal denture aspects prior to the immersion in water and after 23, 26, 40, and 62 days. Additionally, the weight of the dentures was determined each time. The first data record of each denture was used for comparison with each of the corresponding subsequent data records by means of a computer program. The resulting color-coded difference images were evaluated visually and by means of histograms. To asses the movements of the different surface areas, separate histograms were created for four areas of the difference images. The mean deviations of these areas were then statistically evaluated and compared. The movements of the individual elements of the internal aspects were recorded by means of sections of the difference images and vector representation. The dentures that were only stored in water were compared to those that underwent dishwasher <b>cleaning</b> <b>cycles.</b> The dentures stored in water can be considered suitable for incorporation, since the water storage corresponds with the in-vivo situation. The first measurable shape changes occurred on different days in the two material groups, but the changes steadily increased until the last measurement in both material groups. The heat-curing polymer group demonstrated considerably less shape changes than the cold-curing polymer group. In the heat-curing polymer group, {{there was no significant difference}} between the dentures stored in water and those that were subject to additional dishwasher <b>cleaning</b> <b>cycles.</b> As far as the dentures made of cold-curing polymer is concerned, a slightly significant difference between the two subgroups was noticeable. The dentures cleaned in the dishwasher showed more shape changes. This test assembly does not permit a comparison with other studies on shape behavior in general, or on dimensional behavior in particular. The observation that the denture bases extend, however, and the tendency of individual surfaces to change direction correspond with the results of existing studies. The weight development is also congruent with the results of other studies on water absorption. The largest weight increase occurs during the first three weeks. The test samples that were subject to water storage alone continued to absorb water, if only little, until the end of the observation period. The weight of the dentures subject to dishwasher <b>cleaning</b> <b>cycles</b> considerably decreased between the 26 th day and the end of the test, with the dentures made of heat-curing polymer losing more weight than those made of cold-curing polymer. In order to make a reliable statement on the dishwasher stability of dentures, tests involving more than 81 <b>cleaning</b> <b>cycles</b> would have to be conducted. The weight loss indicates that the dentures desiccate. Consequently, changes in flexural strength are to be expected, which should also be investigated...|$|R

50|$|There {{are four}} primary {{factors that affect}} the {{cleaning}} results in an aqueous parts washer. These factors are mechanical energy, temperature, detergent and time. Adjusting {{any one of these}} factors in a <b>cleaning</b> <b>cycle</b> changes the cleaning results. A parts washer with large amounts of mechanical energy and a high temperature delivers shorter cleaning cycles and uses less cleaning detergent. Mechanical energy is provided by the pump drive system. Most aqueous parts washers use an electric motor to drive a centrifugal pump. The mechanical energy delivered to the wash load is what defines the mechanical energy for cleaning and not the horsepower of the pump. Efficient use of the pump motor energy through a well designed centrifugal pump and attention to details of piping design and nozzle types are critical to put the most mechanical energy into the cleaning process. Additionally, one must consider the work volume of the parts washer. In order to achieve similar results, from one size machine to another, the power density must be the same for a given work volume, This factor requires that substantially higher horsepower pumping systems be used as the work volume increases exponentially on larger diameter machines.|$|E

40|$|Theoretical {{models of}} arc roots {{need a good}} {{knowledge}} of physical constants characterizing contact material. With pure metals, all the constants are well known, whereas for the new industrial materials made with silver alloys some of these parameters are still not known. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to get a better understanding of emission of electrons occurring in an alloyed cathode submitted to several vacuum outgassing cycles at room temperature and residual gas pressure of 1. 4 × 10 − 7 mbar. The electron work function (EWF) of silver alloyed contacts, Ag–Ni (70 / 30), was measured photoelectrically, using Fowler's method of isothermal curves. Experimental results about silver–nickel alloys show a large dependence of obtained results with the preparation of contact surface. The EWF of the contact pastille made with silver alloys Ag–Ni varies with surface cleaning by vacuum outgassing cycles. For an unpolished contact, the EWF varies between 4. 34 eV and 4. 51 eV (the EWF of Nickel), after 7 <b>cleaning</b> <b>cycles</b> and <b>cleaning</b> time of 9 days. On the other hand, for a polished contact, the EWF varies between the EWF of the two components, namely from 4. 26 eV for Ag to 4. 51 eV for Ni, at room temperature, after 22 <b>cleaning</b> <b>cycles</b> and a <b>cleaning</b> time of 16 days. The error in determining EWF was ± 0. 03 eV. A multilayer model, taking into account the strong intergranular and volume segregation gives a good interpretation of the obtained results.
