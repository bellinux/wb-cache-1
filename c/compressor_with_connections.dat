40|$|Rotary {{compressors}} {{are widely}} utilized in air conditionders and heat pumps. However, when rotary compressors were applied in room air conditioners, VRFs and domestic water heaters, the systems will experience heavily {{degradation of the}} heating capacity and COP as the ambient temperature goes low. Aimed at these problems, considerable research {{has been carried out}} to raise a series of solutions, such as economizer technology, cascade-type vapor compression heat pump system and two stage coupling heat pump system. At present, economizer technology has become a critical method to improve the performance of air source heat pumps <b>with</b> rotary <b>compressors</b> in low ambient temperature. A novel vapor injection structure on a blade for a rotary compressor has been proposed in previous paper to overcome the drawback of the traditional cylinder injection structure. Based on a verified numerical model, the performance of air source heat pumps <b>with</b> rotary <b>compressors</b> <b>with</b> different economizer technology including a two-stage rotary compressor, a single-stage rotary <b>compressor</b> <b>with</b> traditional injection structure and a single rotary <b>compressor</b> <b>with</b> the novel injection structure has been investigated. The results indicate that: compared to rotary <b>compressors</b> <b>with</b> traditional injection structure, air source heat pump <b>with</b> a rotary <b>compressor</b> <b>with</b> proposed injection structure can enhance the heating capacity and COP by 13 %~ 15 % and 4. 8 %~ 9. 6 %, respectively; and compared to the twin-cylinder rotary compressor, the performance of air source heat pump <b>with</b> a rotary <b>compressor</b> <b>with</b> proposed injection structure is almost the same, so the rotary <b>compressor</b> <b>with</b> the novel injection structure could be considered to replace the two-stage rotary compressor...|$|R

40|$|TutorialTutorial 19 C: Dry {{gas seals}} are {{specified}} {{in most of}} the new centrifugal compressors; yet many installed units are still equipped with conventional oil sealing systems. The benefits of dry gas seals conversions from traditional oil seals to dry gas seals are usually advantageous to compressor operators. However, end users should ask themselves several questions before deciding to retrofit their <b>compressors</b> <b>with</b> dry gas seals. The decision to retrofit a <b>compressor</b> <b>with</b> these upgraded seals may be dictated by economic factors, HSE constraints or technical considerations. Users should consider all of these factors when deciding whether or not to upgrade a <b>compressor</b> <b>with</b> dry gas seals. In addition, the following precautions should be taken during project execution to ensure successful conversion: perform a detailed physical integration analysis of the dry gas seal in the existing compressor; conduct a detailed rotor dynamic analysis; select the proper gas seal system design for the compressor; and plan for operator training. This paper will discuss the factors end users should consider before upgrading to dry gas seals together with an economic evaluation, and the steps that should be taken to ensure a successful conversion once the decision is made to retrofit a <b>compressor</b> <b>with</b> dry gas seals...|$|R

The experimental results show that as the clocking positions vary, the upstream stator wake enters the following passage at different circumferential positions, and then mixes with the local fluid in the following passage. This is the main reason for the variation of the compressor performance resulted from the stator clocking effects. The variation of the compressor performance due to the clocking effect is less pronounced for the <b>compressor</b> <b>with</b> compound-lean stators than with the baseline. At a certain clocking position, the efficiency of the <b>compressor</b> <b>with</b> compound-lean stators is increased in comparison with that of the baseline, especially on small mass flow rate conditions, e. g., 0. 7 % at design condition and 3. 5 % at near-surge condition in this case.
