40|$|<b>Consumers</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> {{is known}} to {{influence}} their food choice. To better understand the sensory perception across cultures, {{it is helpful to}} work with both a descriptive panel and consumers. This study examined how tea products of differing fermentation levels were described and liked by different cultures. Seven tea samples were evaluated by Korean and French trained panels and consumers. The trained panels evaluated the samples on appearance, flavor, and mouthfeel. The consumers rated the samples on acceptability and familiarity. The result indicated that both descriptive panels experienced varying degrees of taste and odor cross-modal interaction. On the unfamiliar samples, French panelists perceived high sweetness, and low bitterness and astringency in the presence of preferred aromas, suggesting that liking influences taste even for trained panels. Consumers generally liked familiar products but even an unfamiliar sample was liked when coupled with more preferred sensory characteristics and less disliked sensory properties. Present findings indicate that even trained panels are influenced by familiarity and liking. In order to better understand the cultural differences in liking, a descriptive sensory test within a culture is recommended especially when the samples are unfamiliar to that culture.

40|$|By {{referring}} to Means-End-Chain-Theory, we identified personal values as the actual buying motive. Since these values {{vary according to}} the <b>consumer’s</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>background,</b> it is expected that culture-specific values lead to culture-specific consumption patterns. To verify this proposition, we conducted laddering-interviews using the example of wine in a German-Ukrainian comparison. As expected, consumers differ with respect to their purchasing motives.

30|$|Despite companies’ active {{participation}} in CSR activities, it remains unclear how they may effectively communicate CSR activities with <b>consumers</b> from different <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> CSR communication strategies that are adapted to consumers’ <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds</b> could be essential (Ding 2006), especially when the message content and audience’s message perception are tied to cultural values (e.g., Kim & Johnson 2013). As individuals’ <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds</b> are important <b>consumer</b> factors influencing campaign effects and effectiveness (de Mooij 2010), previous studies suggests the relative advantages of culturally adapted messages over standardized or culturally non-adapted messages (Han & Shavitt 1994; Zhang & Gelb 1996).|$|R

Hence, since Internet marketing makes extensive use of symbols in order to affect product awareness and cultural meaning, semiotics is a very effective and efficient tool for interpreting online marketing.

40|$|Managing {{cultural}} {{diversity in the}} hospitality industry is a crucial issue. Hospitality managers should understand how cultural differences impact customer perceptions of RM pricing to excel in the global market. In a globalized world, the tourism and hospitality industry provides services to many customers of diverse <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> Until now, most studies of price fairness {{have focused on the}} situational component of price fairness, and studies of consumers' perception of RM pricing in the tourism and hospitality field have attempted to examine the effect of rate fences or situations. Influences of an individual’s characteristics and, in particular, cultural values on price fairness perception have received relatively little scientific examination. In a globalized world, the tourism and hospitality industry provides services to many <b>consumers</b> of diverse <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> Understanding <b>cultural</b> diversity in the hospitality industry is an important issue. Therefore, this study aims to further explore the role of cultural values in fairness perceptions of RM pricing from materialism perspective and to fill the gap in the literature...|$|R
30|$|According to {{a recent}} report from Cone Communications (2012), there is strong {{evidence}} of consumers’ increasing focus on CSR activities: 83  % of Americans wish brands and companies would support worthy causes, and 41  % have purchased a product associated with a cause. This holds true for <b>consumers</b> with different <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> For instance, 64 and 63  % of consumers in Asia and Latin America are respectively willing to pay more to purchase products or services from companies devoting themselves to CSR activities (Nielsen 2014). This global trend may be linked to companies’ active participation in global CSR activities. According to Reputation Institute (2012), 100 reputable companies across 15 countries have spent 102.6 million dollars for implementing global CSR activities.|$|R

The subject is IKEA, a retailer recognized as having a global approach to the markets in which it operates, resulting in a highly standardized approach to store branding. However, rather than employing traditional methodologies to elicit consumer perceptions of store image, we attempt to capture consumer perceptions through interpretations of the visual images generated by the participants themselves. The photo-elicitation method employed captured the different interpretations and meanings attached to commonly identified elements of store image and reinforced the central role played by the store itself in retail image formation...|$|R
40|$|Graphic {{design in}} {{different}} countries exhibits strong cultural characteristics of the countries. The beauty of cultural differences is commonly viewed as making graphic design unique and valuable. Alternately, the diversity of cultures may also result in unsatisfactory design due to a cultural barrier between the designer {{and people who are}} from a different <b>cultural</b> <b>background.</b> As a graphic designer, creating high-quality visual information that satisfies <b>consumers</b> with different <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds</b> is very important. Misinterpretation and misunderstanding of some cultures may result in design failure or cause conflict between different cultural groups. This study compares the acceptance levels of various kinds of symbols between people with a Chinese <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> and those with a background that is not culturally Chinese. For this comparative study, three representative objects were selected: dragon, monkey and fish. For each object, three symbols were selected or designed. An online survey was conducted among currently enrolled students at Iowa State University to evaluate people’ acceptance of these symbols. This study found that people from different <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds</b> perceive meaning of symbols differently. The choices they made were influenced by which ethnic group they came from. When looking at the same set of objects, participants from the same ethnic group tend to make the same choices. In addition, the study results also indicate that Chinese symbols do have strong cultural characteristics that can be easily distinguished from Western symbol designs. With the influence of cultural differences on symbols changing over time, the trend is that Chinese style becomes more recognizable by people from other ethnicities and who speak other languages...|$|R

Applying cultural values at the same national level is useful for understanding differences in consumer product ownership, brand preferences and motives.

Progress in the {{development}} and adoption of the Meat Standards Australia system has encouraged substantial change andan improvedconsumer awareness at all points of theAustralianbeef productionchain. The system ismoving from niche to mainstream market application with the exciting potential to transform many industry practices and build a more direct consumer focus. The system aims to accurately predict consumer satisfaction levels for individual cooked beef portions. This is a major advance on grading systems that classify carcasses into groups of like appearance. A prediction model was developed based on consumer testing and has proved to be useful in categorising a wide range of beef into consumer gradeswithin cookingmethods. These provide a basis to ensure a predictable eating quality result for the consumer and a mechanism to align product description and pricing throughout the production chain. When used in value-based marketing systems financial reward can be directly linked to consumer satisfaction encouraging a consumer-focussed industry. Research is proceeding to extend and improve the accuracy of the predictionmodel encompassing additional cattle types and cooking methods. Several projects in other countries are adding insights into the relative response of <b>consumers</b> from varied <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> It is hoped that further international collaboration will facilitate use of the developed technology to improve consumer value and industry returns through improved product consistency in global markets...|$|R

Using a validated questionnaire, beliefs about pharmaceutical medication were compared between 500 UK undergraduate students who identified themselves as having an Asian or European <b>cultural</b> <b>background.</b> There was a significant association between <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> and beliefs about the benefits and dangers of medicines. Students who self-reported to have an Asian <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> expressed more negative views about medication than those who reported a European <b>cultural</b> <b>background.</b> Students with an Asian <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> {{were significantly more likely}} to perceive medicines as being intrinsically harmful, addictive substances that should be avoided. They were significantly less likely to endorse the benefits of modern medication. There was no significant relationship between <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> and perceptions of personal sensitivity to medication effects or belief about how doctors use medication. In the total sample, past and present experience of taking medication was associated with a more positive orientation to medicines in general. Students who considered themselves to have a European <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> had significantly more experience with prescribed medication than those who selected an Asian <b>cultural</b> <b>background.</b> The relationship between <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> and beliefs about medicines in general was maintained after controlling for potential confounding variables, including chosen degree course, experience of taking prescribed medication, age, and gender. The identification of differences in beliefs about medication, between two specific cultural groups, suggests the need for a greater understanding of the effects of <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> on medicine-usage with potential implications for the conduct of prescribing-related consultations and for the provision of patient information on medication.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{performance}} of outcome instruments with <b>consumers</b> of different <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> We report a study of using routine outcome measures with Indigenous adult mental health consumers, whereby mental health clinicians used two leading Australian measures with consumers who self-identified as Indigenous. Mean scores on most items were different from the predominantly non-Indigenous national averages; some, particularly those assessing accommodation and occupation, were worse while others (those assessing depression) were better. Scores were consistently worse when more informants were involved in the assessment. A set of good practice principles for the use of standardized measures with Indigenous consumers was developed. They recommend using informants whenever possible, ratings should objectively reflect underlying disadvantage and behaviours that are not sanctioned or accepted within the local culture, but not phenomena that are socially or culturally accepted. Despite the advice and training, most assessments did not involve additional informants. The (mainly non-Indigenous) clinicians mostly indicated no additional difficulty in using the outcome measures with the Indigenous consumers, although clinicians reported greater difficulty in completing them when additional informants were present. In 52 % of assessments, clinicians felt that the scales reflected the consumer's problems reasonably, and in 22 %, well. Perceived validity was positively associated with consumer engagement. The study provides qualified support for the practice of using the HoNOS and LSP for routine outcome assessment with Indigenous consumers. The main provisos are that clinicians need to maximize the engagement of consumers and try to ensure involvement of additional informants to reduce the chances of invalid assessments...|$|R

My research question is: How does one spouse's racial and <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> become dominant over the other spouse's racial and <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> and therefore determine the cultural upbringing of their "hapa" children within a multiracial family? Some of the key research questions were whether students associated themselves with one racial an <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> more than the other and why? Were there other multiracial families that they interacted with in their neighborhoods? What were the roles and responsibilites of their parents? of the children in their family? Did gender affect those roles? Was there a certain racial and cultural group they associated with in the school setting? Did their parents prefer one racial and <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> over another in their significant others? Has there been a change, over time, in the way they express the racial and <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> they've adopted? I interviewed three male and five females ranging from freshmen to graduate students.
