40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the effect of}} directions on the Least Preferred <b>Coworker</b> (LPC) scale; specifically, this study tested whether thinking of a generalized least preferred <b>coworker</b> (General LPC) would yield lower scores compared to thinking of a specific least preferred <b>coworker</b> (Specific LPC). The data supported this hypothesis as responses to the General LPC yielded more critical LPC scores than did responses to the Specific LPC. The hypothesis that thinking of a generalized least preferred <b>coworker</b> would yield more stable result than would thinking of a specific least preferred <b>coworker</b> was not supported. Finally, the hypothesis that LPC scores would shift categories (e. g., shifting from task-oriented to relations-oriented) more when thinking of a specific least preferred <b>coworker</b> than when thinking of a general least preferred <b>coworker</b> was not supported.

40|$|Drawing on the {{cognitive}} persistence perspective {{of creativity and}} conservation of resources theory, we investigated how 2 social contexts (perceived relationship conflict and <b>coworker</b> support for creativity) influence the relationship between anger and creative process engagement (CPE) in organizations. We tested our hypotheses using 422 daily surveys from 98 participants, collected over 5 consecutive workdays. The results show that anger perceived relationship conflict and <b>coworker</b> support for creativity interact to influence CPE. Specifically, when relationship conflict is high, the anger–CPE relationship is positive for employees who receive high <b>coworker</b> support for creativity, but negative for those who receive low <b>coworker</b> support for creativity. In contrast, when relationship conflict is low, the anger–CPE relationship is positive but does not differ at high versus low <b>coworker</b> support for creativity...|$|R
40|$|Turnover is a {{constant}} focus for management in the hospitality industry. High turnover {{is associated with a}} loss of productivity, diminished customer service, and lower employee morale. <b>Coworker</b> support has been shown {{to play an important role}} in an individual’s motivation, job satisfaction, reduction in work stress, and lessening of role ambiguity while a lack of <b>coworker</b> support can “push” an individual to begin the process of mentally quitting an organization. In addition, organizational embeddedness has been shown to increase employee retention by creating a web of influences that connect an employee to an organization. The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of <b>coworker</b> support and organizational embeddedness on turnover intention within restaurant settings. The study also investigates the moderating effect of organizational embeddedness on <b>coworker</b> support and turnover intentions. Front-line employees in a restaurant chain located in the United States were surveyed regarding their perception of <b>coworker</b> support, organizational embeddedness and intention to quit. Empirical analyses were conducted using multiple regression, t-tests, and analysis of variance. Findings indicated that organizational embeddedness mediates the relationship between <b>coworker</b> support and turnover intention. Results showed that employees with higher levels of <b>coworker</b> support also had higher levels of organizational embeddedness and lower turnover intention. Results also indicated that <b>coworker</b> support should be examined as a two dimensional construct. Implications, limitations, and recommendations for future studies are also discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{critical}} omission in the <b>coworker</b> influence {{literature is}} how a <b>coworker</b> influences a closely related (focal) employee’s job performance behaviors and whether this influence is contingent on that <b>coworker’s</b> own behaviors. By integrating social information processing and social cognitive theories with social exchange and role theories, we hypothesize that there are, at least, three distinct types of <b>coworker</b> dyadic influence. Accordingly, we develop and test a moderated mediation model to explicate such influence. Two multi-source, field-design studies conducted in Hong Kong supported the modeled relationships in that employee role ambiguity partially mediated the relationships between coworker-employee exchange (CEX) and two types of employee job performance behaviors—task performance and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Furthermore, <b>coworker</b> OCB fostered employee job performance behavior both directly and interactively, acting as a moderator to weaken the relationships between employee role ambiguity and {{the two types of}} job performance behaviors...|$|R

The false-color image was published in 2007. The equatorial radius of the star was estimated to be 2.03 solar radii, and the polar radius 1.63 solar radii—a 25% increase of the stellar radius from pole to equator.

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} work of J. D. Brown and Marc Henneaux in 1986, {{physicists}} have noticed that quantum gravity in a three-dimensional spacetime is closely related to two-dimensional conformal field theory. In 1995, Henneaux and his <b>coworkers</b> explored this relationship in more detail, suggesting that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to the conformal field theory known as Liouville field theory. Another conjecture formulated by Edward Witten states that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to a conformal field theory with monster group symmetry. These conjectures provide examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence that do not require the full apparatus of string or M-theory.|$|E

30|$|These {{results have}} three main {{theoretical}} implications. First, whereas {{previous research on}} organizational pride predominantly looked into attributes of the organization (e.g., Cable and Turban 2003; Helm 2013), this research {{is the first to}} look into employees’ efforts and abilities as sources of organizational pride. It confirms that employees indeed experience organizational pride because of employees’ attributes. Thereby, our findings also complement research showing that <b>coworker</b> support and <b>coworker</b> antagonism shape commitment to organizations (Chiaburu and Harrison 2008) by adding coworkers’ efforts and abilities to the list of <b>coworker</b> characteristics influencing an organization’s attractiveness.|$|R

Oryzomys previously included many other species, which were reclassified in various studies culminating in contributions by Marcelo Weksler and <b>coworkers</b> in 2006 that removed more than forty species from the genus. All are placed in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of the family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analyses}} using {{a variety}} of mitochondrial and nuclear genes places the Noronha skink among the tropical African species of Trachylepis, a position also supported by morphological similarities. It may have arrived on its island on rafting vegetation from southwestern Africa via the Benguela Current and the South Equatorial Current, which passes Fernando de Noronha. This possibility was first suggested by Alfred Russel Wallace before 1888. Mausfeld and <b>coworkers</b> calculated that the journey from Africa to Fernando de Noronha would take 139 days. Because this period seemed too long for the skink to survive, they proposed that the Noronha skink instead arrived via Ascension Island, where a skink may have persisted into historical times.|$|E

Social advancement was thus not dependent solely on birth, patronage, good luck, or even extraordinary ability. Although aristocratic values permeated traditional elite society, a strong tendency towards plutocracy is indicated by the wealth requirements for census rank. Prestige could be obtained through investing one's wealth in ways that advertised it appropriately: grand country estates or townhouses, durable luxury items such as jewels and silverware, public entertainments, funerary monuments for family members or <b>coworkers,</b> and religious dedications such as altars.
