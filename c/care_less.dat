5|$|Old Kazran is soon {{visited by}} {{holographic}} {{images of the}} ship's crew in the present. After observing the effects of Abigail's singing, the crew is singing Christmas carols, the sound frequencies of which are helping to stabilise the ship but cannot prevent it from crashing. Amy appears to Kazran and implores his help, but he waves away the holograms. The Doctor appears, and Kazran surmises that he is there to show Kazran his future, {{but he could not}} <b>care</b> <b>less</b> if he dies old and alone; he reveals that Abigail had an incurable disease on entering cryostorage and will only have one more day to live. As he cannot decide which day that should be, Kazran chastises the Doctor for believing he could change his mind. Unbeknownst to Kazran, the Doctor has brought young Kazran with him; the realisation of how much his bitter future self now resembles his feared father causes a change of heart in Kazran (making his own memory of his future self the show's version of the ghost of Christmas yet to come), and he quickly agrees to release the controls to save the ship.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{lost the}} series three Tests to nil. After {{managing}} {{to draw the}} first two Tests, they lost the next three; the West Indies did not lose a second innings wicket all tour. Hughes {{did not have a}} successful tour with the bat, scoring 215 runs at an average of 21.50. The pressure of the tour told on Hughes. In a match against Trinidad and Tobago, Hughes protested against what he saw as unreasonableness by the opposition by treating the remainder of the match with contempt; not attempting to win. Afterwards Hughes said he could not <b>care</b> <b>less</b> about the welfare of cricket in Trinidad and Tobago; the management fined him for this comment. In the second Test, Rodney Hogg threw a punch at Hughes, frustrated that he was not given the field he wanted by his captain.|$|E

25|$|Endovascular repair {{first became}} {{practical}} in the 1990s {{and although it}} is now an established alternative to open repair, its role {{is yet to be}} clearly defined. It is generally indicated in older, high-risk patients or patients unfit for open repair. However, endovascular repair is feasible for only a proportion of AAAs, depending on the morphology of the aneurysm. The main advantages over open repair are that there is less peri-operative mortality, less time in intensive <b>care,</b> <b>less</b> time in hospital overall and earlier return to normal activity. Disadvantages of endovascular repair include a requirement for more frequent ongoing hospital reviews, and a higher chance of further procedures being required. According to the latest studies, the EVAR procedure does not offer any benefit for overall survival or health-related quality of life compared to open surgery, although aneurysm-related mortality is lower. In patients unfit for open repair, EVAR plus conservative management was associated with no benefit, more complications, subsequent procedures and higher costs compared to conservative management alone. Endovascular treatment for paraanastomotic aneurysms after aortobiiliac reconstruction is also a possibility. A 2017 Cochrane review found tentative evidence of no difference in outcomes between endovascular and open repair of ruptured AAA in the first month.|$|E

500|$|... "Whale Whores" [...] {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly {{described the}} criticism of the save-the-whales conservationists as a [...] "delightfully savage ridicule". Brian Jacks of MTV complimented the show's focus on whale conservation, writing, [...] "Leave it to the hard-hitting folks at South Park to do more for conservationism than fifteen cable reality shows put together." [...] Josh Modell of The A.V. Club said the episode was unfunny and mocked a television series that was [...] "culturally insignificant" [...] and not particularly well-known.

[...] In a more mixed review, Joseph Atilano from the Philippine Daily Inquirer appreciated the lyrics for seeming heartfelt, but felt that its production was [...] "comparatively weaker" [...] by comparison to her earlier projects. Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times felt that the track proved that Cyrus [...] "isn't just a twerk-bot programmed to titillate", but suggested that her [...] "singing throbs with what feels like an embarrassment of emotion" [...] and found it peculiar that the song discussed the singer's relationship with Hemsworth when her public behavior seemingly suggested that she [...] "couldn't <b>care</b> <b>less</b> about" [...] it.|$|E

500|$|It {{was then}} an annual custom for the Pope {{to receive a}} {{delegation}} from Rome's Jewish community shortly after the New Year. The meeting on 2 February 1859 quickly descended into a heated argument, with Pope Pius berating the Jewish visitors for [...] "stirring up a storm all over Europe about this Mortara case". When the delegation denied that the Jews of Rome had had any hand in the anti-clerical articles, the Pope dismissed Scazzocchio as inexperienced and foolish, then shouted: [...] "The newspapers can write all they want. I couldn't <b>care</b> <b>less</b> what the world thinks!" [...] The Pope then calmed down somewhat: [...] "So strong is the pity I have for you, that I pardon you, indeed, I must pardon you." [...] One of the delegates proposed that the Church should not give so much credence to Morisi's testimony, given her spurious morals—the Pope countered that regardless of her character, so {{far as he could}} see the servant had no reason to invent such a story, and in any case Momolo Mortara should not have employed a Catholic in the first place.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{criticized the}} lack of Master Chief as a main character, similar to the {{response}} to The Halo Graphic Novel; Schedeen said that [...] "Master Chief is barely a guest star in his own book", {{and that he was}} reduced to blasting aliens for much of the series. Schedeen felt that {{there was a lack of}} connections between the Ruwan plot and the Master Chief's adventures, which was never satisfactorily resolved. The comic's focus on Ruwan and Myra's subplot was also seen as a major fault: Comics Bulletin's Geoff Collins, in a review of the second issue, said that [...] "as a comic book fan I’m interested , but the Halo fans I know could [...] <b>care</b> <b>less</b> about them. And the story in this issue centers around them." [...] Schedeen was surprised to find that he only began to care about them in the final issue. The many delays in publishing were a frequent point of frustration as well. Schedeen summed up his reviews by saying that he was hopeful the production teams behind the upcoming Halo books [...] "will learn from the mistakes made here and craft stories that can consistently capture what makes Halo fun. At the very least, let's hope we don't have to wait a year between issues anymore".|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Adore You" [...] {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics, who complimented its overall production and Cyrus' vocal delivery. Heather Phares from AllMusic felt that opening Bangerz with an [...] "unabashedly romantic slow song" [...] was [...] "almost as bold a move as the publicity events {{that preceded the}} album's release." [...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone, who had a similar opinion to Phares', called the track a [...] "starkly beautiful album opener". Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly complimented the track for [...] " [...] a key facet of her versatile voice: the throaty diva swoon." [...] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood opined that [...] "Adore You" [...] showcased vocals that [...] " [...] with what feels like an embarrassment of emotion — even to someone who couldn't <b>care</b> <b>less</b> {{about the status of}} her real-life relationship with [...] "Hunger Games" [...] hunk Liam Hemsworth." [...] Kitty Empire from The Guardian suggested that [...] "Adore You" [...] was one of the [...] "least showy and most successful cuts" [...] from Bangerz. [...] Writing for Slant Magazine, Kyle Fowle appreciated the [...] "careful balance of vulnerability and strength" [...] for [...] " [...] potentially tired themes [...] ". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard thought that the song was [...] "emotionally mature but not overly provocative" [...] and a [...] "" [...] choice for opening the album. However, in a more mixed review, Evan Sawdey from PopMatters felt that the track [...] " [...] almost zero rising action [...] little to drive the point home." ...|$|E
