The steady-state performances of the self-optimising variables derived by Jäschke (Jäschke, 2012) are assessed and two main <b>control</b> <b>configurations</b> are examined: a simple decentralised <b>control</b> <b>configuration</b> (PIDs <b>Control)</b> and an advanced multivariable <b>control</b> <b>configuration</b> (Model Predictive <b>Control).</b> The steady-state performances appears to be moderate but need to be re-assessed using a proper steady-state model.

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} testing various <b>control</b> <b>configurations</b> for binary distillation columns. Analyzing from plantwide control point of view the place of distillation column within the plant, {{the result will be}} the best <b>control</b> <b>configuration.</b> The proposed application Test BCC is a very useful tool to evaluate the resulted <b>control</b> <b>configuration</b> for distillation columns. First, it is presented the selection of best <b>control</b> <b>configuration</b> from plantwide <b>control</b> point of view. The resulted <b>control</b> <b>configuration</b> is applied to a real column or to a simulation module via DAQ modules. The two-point composition control problem of binary distillation columns is addressed. The <b>control</b> <b>configuration</b> uses a multivariable controller formed by a parametric decoupler and two monovariabile PI controllers. The example of propane- propylene splitter is used to demonstrate the application efficiency, identifying the best <b>control</b> <b>configurations</b> from potential structures. The limits of this approach for <b>control</b> <b>configuration</b> selection are also analyzed. A closed-loop dynamics study formally shows the potential of the proposed application, matching or improving the behavior obtained with previous schemes. Key-words: plantwide control, composition control, dynamic simulations, distillation columns. ...|$|R
