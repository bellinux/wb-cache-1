40|$|The {{photosynthetic}} cyanobacterium Synechococcus R 2 {{is transformed}} by chimeric donor molecules lacking a functional replication origin but containing {{a region of}} homology to the recipient chromosome. These integrating donor molecules consist of a fragment of Synechococcus R 2 chromosomal DNA cloned in the Escherichia coli vector pBR 322 and interrupted by a piece of foreign DNA. During integration, this interrupting DNA is often lost by nonreciprocal exchange between homologous regions of donor and recipient. When transformed with donor molecules containing in vitro-generated double-stranded gaps or deletions as large as 20 kilobase pairs in the fragment homologous to the recipient chromosome, Synechococcus R 2 can repair these lesions by using recipient information. Chromosomal DNA of the resulting transformants contains direct repeats of the <b>recipient</b> <b>copy</b> {{on either side of}} integrated pBR 322 DNA. Homologous recombination between these repeats generates a circular molecule that can be recovered by transformation to E. coli. Plasmids recovered in E. coli contain the entire copy of information initially present in the region of the Synechococcus recipient corresponding to the donor gap or deletion. We suggest applications of this mechanism for cloning of genes identified by transposon mutagenesis...|$|R
50|$|In February 1938, LDS apostle Melvin J. Ballard {{was sent}} to Thatcher to divide the growing St. Joseph Stake. The newly created Mount Graham Stake covered {{the eastern half of}} the old stake, and Kimball was called as its first stake president. Though smaller than the {{previous}} stake, the newly formed stake covered a large area that extended east as far as El Paso, Texas. For Kimball and his two counselors to visit each ward (LDS congregation) in the stake required traveling a total of 1750 mi. During the Mount Graham Stake's semiannual stake conference in September 1941, unusually heavy rains caused the Gila River to overflow its banks, flooding several of the towns in the stake and causing $100,000 in damage to the farms and buildings of Latter-day Saints in the area. As stake president, Kimball coordinated the LDS Church's humanitarian response, which quickly mobilized funds, materials, and manpower to care for displaced residents and begin recovery. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and the subsequent entry of the United States into World War II, a number of young men from the stake left to join the U.S. military.

30|$|Another aspect {{that must}} be {{considered}} to establish efficient AMT is the integration mode of the T-DNA into the recipient genome. In F. oxysporum, A. awamori, and C. lagenarium, single-copy integration events are predominantly observed (de Groot et al. 1998; Mullins et al. 2001; Tsuji et al. 2003). However, {{the fate of the}} T-DNA in A. aculeatus depends on the AMT method. A high density of A. tumefaciens increased the transformation frequency; however, undesirable integrations of the T-DNA such as multiple-copy integrations at a single locus, with or without the vector backbone, or integration at multiple loci also increased in A. aculeatus, as previously reported in Blastomyces dermatitidis (Sullivan et al. 2002) and in Suillus bovinus (Hanif et al. 2002). In contrast, a low density of A. tumefaciens yielded fewer transformants; however, the T-DNA predominantly existed as a single <b>copy</b> in the <b>recipient</b> genome. Although we expected to obtain more transformants by co-cultivating A. tumefaciens cells and fungal conidia in high quantities on solid or liquid IM, this technique did not yield more transformants. There is a limit to the concentration of bacterial cells and fungal conidia for efficient AMT that is likely related to the physiological conditions of A. tumefaciens and the recipient fungal cells (Meyer et al. 2003). The best AMT method should increase the number of transformants harboring the T-DNA as a single copy, which is a criterion with apparently opposing contributing factors. Thus, we hereby propose that AMT using liquid IM satisfies this criterion for random insertional mutagenesis.|$|R
40|$|Conjugative relaxases are the {{proteins}} that initiate bacterial conjugation by a site-specific cleavage of the transferred DNA strand. In vitro, they show strand-transferase activity on single-stranded DNA, which suggests {{they may also}} be responsible for recircularization of the transferred DNA. In this work, we show that TrwC, the relaxase of plasmid R 388, is fully functional in the recipient cell, as shown by complementation of an R 388 trwC mutant in the recipient. TrwC transport to the recipient is also observed in the absence of DNA transfer, although it still requires the conjugative coupling protein. In addition to its role in conjugation, TrwC is able to catalyze site-specific recombination between two origin of transfer (oriT) copies. Mutations that abolish TrwC DNA strand-transferase activity also abolish oriT-specific recombination. A plasmid containing two oriT copies resident in the recipient cell undergoes recombination when a TrwC-piloted DNA is conjugatively transferred into it. Finally, we show TrwC-dependent integration of the transferred DNA into a resident oriT <b>copy</b> in the <b>recipient</b> cell. Our results indicate that a conjugative relaxase is active once in the recipient cell, where it performs the nicking and strand-transfer reactions that would be required to recircularize the transferred DNA. This TrwC site-specific integration activity in recipient cells may lead to future biotechnological applications. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

40|$|Tn 5385 is a ca. 65 -kb element {{integrated}} into the chromosomes of clinical Enterococcus faecalis strains CH 19 and CH 116. It confers resistance to erythromycin, gentamicin, mercuric chloride, streptomycin, tetracycline-minocycline, and penicillin via β-lactamase production. Tn 5385 is a composite structure containing regions previously found in staphylococcal and enterococcal plasmids. Several transposons and transposon-like elements within Tn 5385 have been identified, including conjugative transposon Tn 5381, composite transposon Tn 5384, and elements indistinguishable from staphylococcal transposons Tn 4001 and Tn 552. The divergent regions of Tn 5385 are linked {{by a series of}} insertion sequence (IS) elements (IS 256, IS 257, and IS 1216) of staphylococcal and enterococcal origin. The ends of Tn 5385 consist of directly repeated copies of enterococcal IS 1216. Within the chromosomes of strains CH 19 and CH 116, Tn 5385 has interrupted an open reading frame with substantial homology to previously described alkyl hydrogen peroxide reductase genes. Segments of this open reading frame in both CH 19 and CH 116 have been deleted, but the amount of deleted DNA differs for the two insertions. Transfer of Tn 5385 from both donors into E. faecalis recipients occurs at a low frequency. Two types of transconjugants have been identified. In one type, the target alkyl hydrogen peroxide reductase open reading frame has been deleted, and sequences flanking Tn 5385 in the respective donors are carried over to the transconjugants. These data suggest that the mechanism of Tn 5385 insertion into the recipient chromosome in these transconjugants was recombination across flanking regions in the donors and homologous sequences in the recipients. The second type of transconjugant appears to have resulted from excision of Tn 5385 from the CH 19 chromosome by recombination across the terminal IS 1216 elements and insertion into the recipient chromosome by recombination across Tn 5381 (within Tn 5385) and a previously transferred Tn 5381 <b>copy</b> in the <b>recipient</b> chromosome. These data confirm that Tn 5385 is a composite structure with genetic material from diverse genera and suggest that it is a functional transposon. They also suggest that chromosomal recombination is a mechanism of genetic exchange in enterococci...|$|R
