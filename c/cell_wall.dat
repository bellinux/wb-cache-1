5|$|Gram-positive {{bacteria}} {{possess a}} thick <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> containing {{many layers of}} peptidoglycan and teichoic acids. In contrast, gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second lipid membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins. Lipopolysaccharides, also called endotoxins, are composed of polysaccharides and lipid A {{that is responsible for}} much of the toxicity of gram-negative bacteria. Most bacteria have the gram-negative <b>cell</b> <b>wall,</b> and only the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria have the alternative gram-positive arrangement. These two groups were previously known as the low G+C and high G+C gram-positive bacteria, respectively. These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility; for instance, vancomycin can kill only gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against gram-negative pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. If the bacterial <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> is entirely removed, it is called a protoplast, whereas if it is partially removed, it is called a spheroplast. β-Lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial <b>cell</b> <b>wall.</b> The enzyme lysozyme, found in human tears, also digests the <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> of bacteria and is the body's main defence against eye infections.|$|E
5|$|E. coli stains Gram-negative {{because its}} <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> is {{composed}} of a thin peptidoglycan layer and an outer membrane. During the staining process, E. coli picks up {{the color of the}} counterstain safranin and stains pink. The outer membrane surrounding the <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> provides a barrier to certain antibiotics such that E. coli is not damaged by penicillin.|$|E
5|$|The fungal <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> is {{composed}} of glucans and chitin; while glucans are also found in plants and chitin in the exoskeleton of arthropods, fungi are the only organisms that combine these two structural molecules in their <b>cell</b> <b>wall.</b> Unlike those of plants and oomycetes, fungal cell walls do not contain cellulose.|$|E
40|$|Rabbits were {{injected}} with <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> obtained from crown-gall tumor tissue or the corresponding <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> from normal potato tissue. The serum obtained from rabbits 53 days {{after they were}} {{injected with}} tumor <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> contained immunoglobins that reacted with both tumor and normal <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> {{as well as with}} the cells from the inciting strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. When this serum was repeatedly absorbed against normal <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> and the <b>cells</b> of the inciting strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, only tumor-specific immunoglobins remained. These immunoglobins did not react with <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> obtained from meristematic (nontumorous) potato tissue. Yet this same serum reacted with crown-gall tumor <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> obtained from turnip and carrot discs...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cell</b> <b>walls</b> of Histoplasma capsulatum and Blastomyces dermatitidis, {{obtained}} by mechanical breakage of yeast- and mycelial-phase cultures, were lipid-extracted and then fractionated with ethylenediamine. Unextracted <b>cell</b> <b>walls,</b> lipid-extracted <b>cell</b> <b>walls,</b> {{and the three}} fractions resulting from ethylenediamine treatment were examined for monosaccharide and chitin content. The yeast-phase <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> of five strains of H. capsulatum fell into two categories, designated chemotypes I and II, one of which, chemotype II, was similar to yeast-phase <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> derived from three strains of B. dermatitidis. H. capsulatum chemotype I <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> were characterized by lower content of material soluble in ethylenediamine, higher chitin content, and lower monosaccharide content than H. capsulatum chemotype II or B. dermatitidis <b>cell</b> <b>walls.</b> Approximately 80 % of the monosaccharides of chemotype I <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> was combined in forms susceptible to attack by mild acid hydrolysis, compared with about 50 % of the monosaccharides of chemotype II and B. dermatitidis. H. capsulatum and B. dermatitidis yeast-phase <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> could be distinguished, however, by their susceptibility to attack by a crude enzyme system derived from a Streptomyces sp. incubated with chitin as the only carbon source. Both glucose and acetylglucosamine were released from H. capsulatum <b>cell</b> <b>walls,</b> regardless of chemotype, during enzymatic hydrolysis, whereas only acetylglucosamine was released from B. dermatitidis yeast-phase <b>cell</b> <b>walls.</b> Mycelial-phase <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> of H. capsulatum and B. dermatitidis were characterized by lower content of material soluble in ethylenediamine, higher proportions of mannose, and lower chitin content than their respective yeast phases. Glucose and acetylglucosamine were both released from all mycelial-phase <b>cell</b> <b>walls,</b> whether H. capsulatum or B. dermatitidis, by the crude enzyme system...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cell</b> <b>walls</b> {{prepared}} by mechanically disrupting intact Rickettsia mooseri (R. typhi) {{were examined in}} an electron microscope and analyzed chemically. Electron micrographs of metal-shadowed and negatively stained rickettsial <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> revealed no significant differences, except for smaller size, from bacterial <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> prepared in a similar manner. The chemical composition was complex, and resembled that of gram-negative bacterial <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> more closely than that of gram-positive bacterial <b>cell</b> <b>walls.</b> R. mooseri <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> contained the sugars, glucose, galactose, and glucuronic acid, the amino sugars, glucosamine, and muramic acid, and at least 15 amino acids. Diaminopimelic acid, a compound hitherto found only in bacteria and blue-green algae, was demonstrated in rickettsiae for the first time. Teichoic acids were not detected. The compounds identified accounted for about 70 % of the dry weight of the <b>cell</b> <b>walls...</b>|$|R
5|$|Archaea and {{bacteria}} have generally similar cell structure, but cell composition and organization set the archaea apart. Like bacteria, archaea lack interior membranes and organelles. Like bacteria, the cell membranes of archaea are usually bounded by a <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> and they swim using {{one or more}} flagella. Structurally, archaea are most similar to gram-positive bacteria. Most have a single plasma membrane and <b>cell</b> <b>wall,</b> and lack a periplasmic space; the exception to this general rule is Ignicoccus, which possess a particularly large periplasm that contains membrane-bound vesicles and is enclosed by an outer membrane.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{also are}} used to inhibit enzymes needed for the {{survival}} of pathogens. For example, bacteria are surrounded by a thick <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> made of a net-like polymer called peptidoglycan. Many antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link the strands of this polymer together. This causes the <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> to lose strength and the bacteria to burst. In the figure, a molecule of penicillin (shown in a ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to its target, the transpeptidase from the bacteria Streptomyces R61 (the protein is shown as a ribbon-diagram).|$|E
5|$|HypSys are {{localised}} in the <b>cell</b> <b>wall.</b> The precursor {{for tobacco}} HypSys is transcribed as a 165 amino acid polypeptide {{which has no}} structural homology to the precursor for systemin in tomato. The structural properties of HypSys, containing hydroxyproline and being glycosylated, indicate that they are synthesised through the secretory system. The precursor to HypSys in tomato is a 146 amino acid polypeptide, exclusively synthesised within the vascular bundles of leaves and petioles associated with parenchyma cells of phloem bundles. Unlike systemin, it is primarily associated with the <b>cell</b> <b>wall.</b> The precursors to HypSys appear to represent a distinct subfamily of hydroxyproline-rich proteins found in cell walls. Upon wounding {{it is thought that}} a protease from the cytosol, the <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> matrix, or the pathogen, processes the precursor producing active HypSys peptides.|$|E
30|$|The solute {{diffusion}} into <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> {{was suggested}} {{to be driven}} by the higher solute concentration in cell cavities than that in <b>cell</b> <b>walls,</b> which is caused by the higher evaporation rate of solvent from cell cavities than that from <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> [5]. The amount of solute diffusing into <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> is considered to be increased by increasing the following two factors. The first factor is the difference in solute concentration between cell cavities and <b>cell</b> <b>walls.</b> The second factor is the solute diffusivity into <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> [6]. It should be noticed that both these factors may be affected by the atmospheric state such as relative humidity (RH) and temperature during the conditioning. The goal of our work was to determine the atmospheric states that maximize the amount of the solute diffused into <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> by controlling the solute diffusion during conditioning process.|$|R
50|$|L-form {{bacteria}} are strains bacteria that lack <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> derived from bacteria that normally possess <b>cell</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R
25|$|Like plants, algae have <b>cell</b> <b>walls.</b> Algal <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> contain either polysaccharides (such as {{cellulose}} (a glucan)) or {{a variety}} of glycoproteins (Volvocales) or both. The inclusion of additional polysaccharides in algal <b>cells</b> <b>walls</b> {{is used as a}} feature for algal taxonomy.|$|R
5|$|Penetration follows attachment: Virions {{enter the}} host cell through receptor-mediated {{endocytosis}} or membrane fusion. This {{is often called}} viral entry. The infection of plant and fungal cells {{is different from that}} of animal cells. Plants have a rigid <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> made of cellulose, and fungi one of chitin, so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the <b>cell</b> <b>wall.</b> However, nearly all plant viruses (such as tobacco mosaic virus) can also move directly from cell to cell, in the form of single-stranded nucleoprotein complexes, through pores called plasmodesmata. Bacteria, like plants, have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell. However, given that bacterial cell walls are much less thick than plant cell walls due to their much smaller size, some viruses have evolved mechanisms that inject their genome into the bacterial cell across the <b>cell</b> <b>wall,</b> while the viral capsid remains outside.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{synthesise}} {{a number}} of unique polymers like the polysaccharide molecules cellulose, pectin and xyloglucan from which the land plant <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> is constructed.|$|E
5|$|Spiroplasma is a cell wall–deficient {{bacterium}} {{related to}} Mycoplasma, which some think {{may be the}} cause of the TSEs. The lack of a <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> means it is not susceptible to conventional antibiotics such as penicillin, which target <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> synthesis. Frank O. Bastian of Louisiana State University first discovered Spiroplasma-like inclusions in the brain of a CJD patient during an autopsy in 1979 and has hypothesized that this bacterium could possibly {{be the cause of}} the TSEs.|$|E
40|$|The polysaccharides of <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> {{isolated}} from the fleshy, edible part of {{the fruit of the}} monocotyledon pineapple [Ananas comosus (L.) Merr. ] (family Bromeliaceae) were analyzed chemically. These <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> were derived mostly from parenchyma cells and were shown histochemically to be unlignified, but they contained ester-linked ferulic acid. The analyses indicated that the noncellulosic polysaccharide composition of the <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> was intermediate between that of unlignified <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> of species of the monocotyledon family Poaceae (grasses and cereals) and that of unlignified <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> of dicotyledons. Glucuronoarabinoxylans were the major non-cellulosic polysaccharides in the pineapple <b>cell</b> <b>walls.</b> Xyloglucans were also present, together with small amounts of pectic polysaccharides and glucomannans (or galactoglucomannans). The large amounts of glucuronoarabinoxylans and small amounts of pectic polysaccharides resemble the noncellulosic polysaccharide composition of the unlignified <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> of the Poaceae. However, the absence of (1 [...] > 3, 1 [...] > 4) -beta-glucans, the presence of relatively large amounts of xyloglucans, and the possible structure of the xyloglucans resemble the noncellulosic polysaccharide composition of the unlignified <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> of dicotyledons...|$|R
40|$|Coxiella burnetii {{morphological}} cell types were fractionated into large-cell variant <b>cell</b> <b>walls,</b> two {{fractions of}} small-cell variant <b>cell</b> <b>walls,</b> and one fraction of small-cell variant whole cells. Based on {{the contents of}} peptidoglycan (PG) -constituents and the yields of the sodium dodecyl sulfate-insoluble PG-protein complex (PG-PC) from <b>cell</b> <b>walls,</b> the fraction of large-cell variant <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> contained significantly less PG than did the fraction of small-cell variant <b>cell</b> <b>walls.</b> The yields of PG-PC from the fractions of large-cell variant <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> and small-cell variant <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> were 2 and 32 %, respectively. These {{results indicated that the}} PG of the large-cell variant <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> may be partially digested by PG-lytic enzymes or incompletely synthesized, whereas the small-cell variant <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> appeared to have intact PG. Proteins associated with PG-PC were resistant to proteolysis by trypsin, protease VI, and proteinase K. Saturated and unsaturated fatty acids were detected in whole <b>cells</b> and <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> but not in PG-PC, which contained a 3 -deoxy-D-mannooctulosonic acid-like component that is also present in phase I lipopolysaccharide. Immunogenicity of the fractions was tested by measuring the temporal sequence of phase II and phase I antibody responses in vaccinated rabbits. Both phase II and phase I antibody responses were demonstrated with all fractions except the sodium dodecyl sulfate supernatant of the small-cell variant <b>cell</b> <b>walls,</b> whereas PG-PC elicited a pure phase II antibody response up to 29 days postvaccination. The immunogenicity of these fractions may reflect a quantitative difference in antigen concentration or may be due to a qualitative difference in phase II and I determinants...|$|R
40|$|Protective {{potency of}} oil-treated <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> of various {{mycobacteria}} against airborne infection of mice {{with a few}} cells of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H 37 Rv was {{compared with that of}} viable BCG. Although less potent than BCG <b>cell</b> <b>walls,</b> the <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> of atypical mycobacteria of Runyon's groups I to IV protected against challenge by aerosol to some degree. Protection afforded by <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> of H 37 Rv and of the avirulent mutants H 37 Ra and Washington II was comparable to that provided by BCG <b>cell</b> <b>walls.</b> However, <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> of a highly virulent strain of M. bovis (Bovinus I) provided the best protection yet achieved. Present evidence suggests that protective substances are shared by all mycobacteria but in differing amounts; the relationship between virulence and immunogenicity has yet to be clarified...|$|R
5|$|Although fungi are opisthokonts—a {{grouping}} of evolutionarily related organisms broadly {{characterized by a}} single posterior flagellum—all phyla except for the chytrids have lost their posterior flagella. Fungi are unusual among the eukaryotes in having a <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> that, in addition to glucans (e.g., β-1,3-glucan) and other typical components, also contains the biopolymer chitin.|$|E
5|$|Prokaryotes {{have only}} one lipid bilayer- the cell {{membrane}} (also known as the plasma membrane). Many prokaryotes also have a <b>cell</b> <b>wall,</b> but the <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> is composed of proteins or long chain carbohydrates, not lipids. In contrast, eukaryotes {{have a range of}} organelles including the nucleus, mitochondria, lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum. All of these sub-cellular compartments are surrounded by one or more lipid bilayers and, together, typically comprise the majority of the bilayer area present in the cell. In liver hepatocytes for example, the plasma membrane accounts for only two percent of the total bilayer area of the cell, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum contains more than fifty percent and the mitochondria a further thirty percent.|$|E
5|$|There are broadly {{speaking}} {{two different types}} of <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> in bacteria, a thick one in the gram-positives and a thinner one in the gram-negatives.

40|$|Peritoneal macrophages from Fischer 344 rats were {{cytotoxic}} for mouse fibroblasts after {{in vitro}} phagocytosis of non-biodegradable group A streptococcal <b>cell</b> <b>walls.</b> In contrast, macrophages from Buffalo rats were not activated to cytotoxicity by bacterial <b>cell</b> <b>walls.</b> Activation to cytotoxicity was only {{achieved by the}} macrophages after an interval of at least 3 days in culture after ingestion of group A <b>cell</b> <b>walls.</b> If macrophages were cultured only 24 h after ingestion of <b>cell</b> <b>walls,</b> a cytostatic effect on target cells was observed. Phagocytosis of biodegradable group D streptococcal <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> did not activate macrophages from either rat strain to become cytotoxic. No direct toxicity of <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> for macrophages or mouse L-cells was observed. The cytotoxicity of Fischer 344 macrophages appears to require direct cell contact with target cells...|$|R
30|$|V − p(0) {{was larger}} than p(0) and {{increased}} with U up to 20 mass% and then decreased. This indicates {{that the majority of}} the polymers in <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> increased during conditioning, and that the amount of the polymers that diffused into <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> was at a maximum at U =  20 mass%. This was explained by two factors: the decrease in the diffusivity into <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> and in the concentration difference between <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> and <b>cell</b> cavity of the polymers with the concentration, based on the behavior of W during conditioning; and the estimated minimum concentration at which the solution contains the least amount of the polymers required to fill the <b>cell</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent {{insights}} into the physical biology of plant <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> are reviewed, summarizing the essential differences between primary and secondary <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> and identifying crucial gaps in our knowledge of their structure and biomechanics.

There is a particular need to revise current “cartoons” of plant <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> to be more consistent with data from diverse approaches and to go beyond summarizing limited aspects of <b>cell</b> <b>walls,</b> serving instead as guides for future experiments and {{for the application of}} new techniques...|$|R
5|$|With plants: Fungi have a <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> and vacuoles. They {{reproduce}} by both {{sexual and}} asexual means, and like basal plant groups (such as ferns and mosses) produce spores. Similar to mosses and algae, fungi typically have haploid nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is used {{in cases}} of {{suspected}} toxic shock syndrome, often in combination with a bactericidal agent such as vancomycin. The rationale for this approach is a presumed synergy between vancomycin, which causes {{the death of the}} bacteria by breakdown of the <b>cell</b> <b>wall,</b> and clindamycin, which is a powerful inhibitor of toxin synthesis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown clindamycin reduces the production of exotoxins by staphylococci; it may also induce changes in the surface structure of bacteria that make them more sensitive to immune system attack (opsonization and phagocytosis).|$|E
5|$|In {{those species}} which {{reproduce}} sexually, haploid cells bud from the spores. Depending {{on the environmental}} conditions, either a myxamoeba or a myxoflagellate buds from the spore. Myxamoebae move like amoebae – that is, crawling on the substrate – and are produced in dry conditions. Myxoflagellates, which are peritrichous and can swim, develop in moist to wet environments. Myxoflagellates almost always have two flagella; one is generally shorter than the other and sometimes only vestigial. The flagella are used for locomotion and to help to move food particles closer. If the humidity changes, cells can switch between the two manifestations. Neither form has a <b>cell</b> <b>wall.</b> This developmental stage (and the next one) serves as a nourishment provider and {{is also known as}} the first trophic phase (nourishment phase). In this monocellular phase, the Myxogastria consume bacteria and fungus spores, and probably dissolved substances, and they reproduce through simple cell division. If the environmental conditions change adversely in this phase, for example extreme temperature, extreme dryness or food shortage, the Myxogastria may switch to very long-lived, thin-shelled quiescent states – the so-called microcysts. For that to happen, the myxamoebae assume a round shape and secrete a thin <b>cell</b> <b>wall.</b> In this state they can easily survive one year or longer. If living conditions improve, they become active again.|$|E
40|$|The <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> of an 80 / 81 {{strain of}} Staphylococcus aureus (NYH- 6) contain alanine, glycine, glutamic acid, lysine, muramic acid, glucosamine, and ribitol phosphate. 94 per {{cent of the}} {{phosphorus}} and 41 per cent of the glucosamine are removed by extraction of the <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> with hot 5 per cent TCA, but significant amounts of the other constituents are not extracted by this procedure. The residue after hot TCA extraction (mucopeptide) is susceptible to lysozyme whereas the intact <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> are resistant. Staphylococcus aureus <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> are agglutinated by S. aureus antisera. Agglutination of the <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> of one S. aureus strain is inhibited by absorption of antisera with <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> of other S. aureus strains but not by absorption with S. albus <b>cell</b> <b>walls.</b> The ribitol teichoic acid can be isolated from cold TCA extracts of the <b>cell</b> <b>walls.</b> This compound consists almost entirely of ribitol phosphate and glucosamine. The isolated teichoic acid of strain NYH- 6 is readily fixed to tanned sheep erythrocytes and these sensitized cells are agglutinated by S. aureus antisera. Cold TCA extracts of <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> of other strains of S. aureus inhibit hemagglutination whereas extracts of S. albus walls do not.

40|$|Mutanolysin {{biosynthesis}} and pigment {{production in}} Streptomyces globisporus ATCC 21553 were stimulated by adding bacterial <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> to the medium. The increased bacteriolytic {{activity in the}} supernatant correlated with an increased de novo synthesis of mutanolysin and was between 4 - and 20 -fold higher than in cultures grown without bacterial <b>cell</b> <b>walls.</b> The increase in mutanolysin synthesis was brought about by enhanced transcription of the mutanolysin gene. The stimulation was only observed in medium which contained dextrin or starch as the carbon source. Glucose abolished the stimulation and also inhibited the low constitutive synthesis of mutanolysin. The induction of lytic activity was observed to require minimally 0. 4 mg of bacterial <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> per ml, whereas 0. 6 mg of bacterial <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> per ml yielded maximal lytic activity. Further supplements of bacterial <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> {{did not result in}} enhanced lytic activity. The stimulation could be achieved independently of the phase of growth of the Streptomyces strain. Cultures grown in the presence of bacterial <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> exhibited a higher growth yield. However, the accelerated growth was not the reason for the increased amount of mutanolysin produced. The growth of cultures with peptidoglycan monomers added to the medium instead of <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> was similarly increased, but an effect on the biosynthesis of mutanolysin was not observed. All bacterial <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> tested were capable of eliciting the stimulation of lytic activity, including <b>cell</b> <b>walls</b> of archaea, which contained pseudomurein...|$|R
