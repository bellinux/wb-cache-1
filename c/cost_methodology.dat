25|$|High costs {{may also}} be a factor and {{research}} by the Genk Institute for Fertility Technology, in Belgium, claimed a much lower <b>cost</b> <b>methodology</b> (about 90% reduction) with similar efficacy, which may be suitable for some fertility treatment. At the 1994 United Nations International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo, the prevention and treatment of infertility was accepted into the program of action for reproductive healthcare. Infertility has shown to have a greater effect on developing nations than on birth rates or population control, but also on a social level as well. Reproduction is a large aspect of life for many cultures within developing nations, and infertility can lead to social and familial problems such as rejection or abandonment as well as personal psychological issues. Currently, fertility treatment options and programs are only available through private health sectors in developing nations and little-to-no treatment is available through public health sectors. The fertility treatment options offered through the private sectors are often costly or not easily accessible. Additionally, counseling is considered an essential aspect of fertility treatment, and due to lack of education and resources such forms of therapy remain scarce as well. While quality fertility care is not readily available in developing nations (such as sub-Saharan African countries), a standard procedure of care could be easily implemented for a low cost as a basic intervention. The lack of fertility treatment is problematic, and high birth and population rates are every reason to implement treatment options rather than reject them.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} builds upon {{a body of}} work on {{the development}} and introduction of information systems in the UK National Health Service following the implementation of the White Paper 'Working for Patients'. None of the earlier studies examined the use of the information from those systems for costing health care services, the methodologies used by hospitals for costing their products or the comparability of the output from the <b>costing</b> <b>methodologies</b> used, thereby making this study different from prior work. <b>Costing</b> <b>methodologies</b> cited in the literature are described from the perspective of single organisations. This research analyses the development of an aggregated costing approach, focusing on the issues laced when trying to develop a <b>costing</b> <b>methodology</b> that will be applied to a group of autonomous organisations. The research provides a comparison of health care <b>costing</b> <b>methodologies</b> in both the United Kiiigdom and Ontario, Canada. Collected through interviews and a postal survey tool, data from NHS hospital care providers are analysed to identify both the conformity of the approach and the results of the <b>costing</b> <b>methodologies</b> eniployed. Information from an extended field study is used to review the development of a micro-costing framework in Ontario for radiation therapy services. These findings are then synthesised into a generic framework applicable within other health care organisations seeking to implement a comparative <b>costing</b> <b>methodology.</b> This lramcwork is used to identify possible causes of variance in health care costing approaches. Elements of the framework requiring modification to account for local conditions, such as salary rates or provider availability, are identified and suggestions are made for further work resulting from this research to increase understanding about variability in health care <b>costing</b> <b>methodologies</b> and test the implementation of the generic <b>costing</b> <b>methodology...</b>|$|R

Using PGD gives members of these select demographic groups disproportionate access to a means of creating a child possessing characteristics that they consider [...] "ideal," [...] raising issues of equal opportunity for both the parents'/parent's and the child's generation. Many fertile couples now demand equal access to embryonic screening so that their child can be just as healthy as one created through IVF. Mass use of PGD, especially as a means of population control or in the presence of legal measures related to population or demographic control, can lead to intentional or unintentional demographic effects such as the skewed live-birth sex ratios seen in communist China following implementation of its one-child policy.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} {{theoretical}} and empirical analysis of the EU research policy and its impacts. The aim of the thesis is to evaluate effects of this policy on the financial management of universities, or more precisely the impact of financial rules defined by the European Commission (EC) in the 7 th Framework Programme (FP 7) {{on the development of}} full <b>cost</b> <b>methodologies</b> at universities in the EU 27. The thesis also analyzes the process of the preparation of the new FP 8 HORIZON 2020 financial rules and asses if feedback and needs of participating universities are reflected and thus principles of European good governance are applied. In order to meet its goals, the thesis states three hypotheses: Hypothesis 1 : Universities from the EU 27 that participate in FP 7 develop full <b>cost</b> <b>methodologies.</b> Hypothesis 2 : EC requirements in FP 7 are one of the main drivers to implement full <b>cost</b> <b>methodologies</b> for universities form EU 27. Hypothesis 3 : Universities from the EU 27 communicate development of their full <b>cost</b> <b>methodologies</b> with the EC. The thesis is organized into four chapters. The first one characterizes the concept of European good governance and one of its instruments, i. e. policy evaluation and its use in the thesis (including the analysis of performed questionnaire research). Second chapter defines the term of financial management and its use in the thesis. Third chapter describes the EU research policy, its historical development, main instruments (FPs), role of European institutions and attitude to full costing. The last forth chapter analyzes in details experience of universities form EU 27 with development of full <b>cost</b> <b>methodologies.</b> Within its conclusions, the thesis proves that the EU research policy significantly influences the financial management of universities from EU 27 and implementation of full <b>cost</b> <b>methodologies</b> by them. It is inter alia proved, that 70 % of universities from the EU 27 that do not implement full costing in FP 7 yet plan to introduce such methodologies in the future; that FP 7 financial rules are drivers to implement full <b>cost</b> <b>methodologies</b> for almost 2 / 3 universities from the EU 27 participating in FP 7 and that 3 / 4 of universities form EU 27 applying full costing in FP 7 consulted on their methodologies with the EC. All three hypotheses thus were verified. Nevertheless, it was concluded that principles of European good governance are not satisfactory applied by the EC, because it does not support the use of full costing in HORIZON 2020 anymore...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to measure and compare the direct costs of intensive care unit (ICU) days at seven ICU departments in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom by means of a standardized <b>costing</b> <b>methodology.</b> MethodsA retrospective <b>cost</b> analysis of ICU patients was performed from the hospital's perspective. The standardized <b>costing</b> <b>methodology</b> was developed on the basis of the availability of data at the seven ICU departments. It entailed the application of the bottom–up approach for “hotel and nutrition” and the top–down approach for “diagnostics,” “consumables,” and “labor. ”ResultsDirect costs per ICU day ranged from € 1168 to € 2025. Even though the distribution of costs varied by cost component, labor was the most important cost driver at all departments. The costs for “labor” amounted to € 1629 at department G but were fairly similar at the other departments (€ 711 ± 115). ConclusionsDirect costs of ICU days vary widely between the seven departments.

40|$|Abstract Introduction In {{the context}} of the current human {{resources}} for health (HRH) crisis, the need for comprehensive Human Resources Development Plans (HRDP) is acute, especially in resource-scarce sub-Saharan African countries. However, the financial implications of such plans rarely receive due consideration, despite the availability of much advice and examples in the literature on how to conduct HRDP costing. Global initiatives have also been launched recently to standardise <b>costing</b> <b>methodologies</b> and respective tools. Methods This paper reports on two separate experiences of HRDP costing in Mozambique and Guinea Bissau, with the objective to provide an insight into the practice of costing exercises in information-poor settings, as well as to contribute to the existing debate on HRH <b>costing</b> <b>methodologies.</b> The study adopts a case-study approach to analyse the methodologies developed in the two countries, their contexts, policy processes and actors involved. Results From the analysis of the two cases, it emerged that the costing exercises represented an important driver of the HRDP elaboration, which lent credibility to the process, and provided a financial framework within which HRH policies could be discussed. In both cases, bottom-up and country-specific methods were designed to overcome the countries' lack of cost and financing data, as well as to interpret their financial systems. Such an approach also allowed the costing exercises to feed directly into the national planning and budgeting process. Conclusions The authors conclude that bottom-up and country-specific <b>costing</b> <b>methodologies</b> have the potential to serve adequately the multi-faceted purpose of the exercise. It is recognised that standardised tools and methodologies may help reduce local governments' dependency on foreign expertise to conduct the HRDP costing and facilitate regional and international comparisons. However, adopting pre-defined and insufficiently flexible tools may undermine the credibility of the costing exercise, and reduce the space for policy negotiation opportunities within the HRDP elaboration process. </p...|$|R
