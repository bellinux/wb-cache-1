5000|$|Piston {{moves from}} <b>crank</b> <b>end</b> (BDC, {{bottom dead centre}} and maximum volume) to {{cylinder}} head end (TDC, top dead centre and minimum volume) as the working gas with initial state 1 is compressed isentropically to state point 2, through compression ratio [...] Mechanically this is the isentropic compression of the air/fuel mixture in the cylinder, {{also known as the}} compression stroke. This isentropic process assumes that no mechanical energy is lost due to friction and no heat is transferred to or from the gas, hence the process is reversible. The compression process requires that mechanical work be added to the working gas. Generally the compression ratio is around 9-10:1 [...] for a typical engine.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{static load}} {{analysis}} was performed on two proposed models of connecting rods (conventional and Y-shape con-rod) intended {{for use in the}} crank-rocker engine. The analysis was done by modeling the model using CATIA V 5 software which was then analyzed using ANSYS Workbench 14. 0 software. A static analysis was done to determine the von-misses stresses under tensile and compressive loading conditions. Two cases were studied, firstly, the load was applied at the rocker pin end and fixed at the <b>crank</b> <b>end</b> as a compressive load, and secondly, the load was applied at the same position as a tensile load with both cases under the same constant load. It was found from the analysis that the conventional connecting rod has yielded lower stress values for both cases as compared to the Y-shaped connecting rod. Based on the results, it was concluded that the normal connecting rod is better to be used for the crank-rocker engine...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design connecting rod of {{internal combustion engine}} using the topology optimization. The objectives of this paper are to develop structural modeling,finite element analyze and the optimization of the connecting rod for robust design. The structure of connecting rod was modeled utilized SOLIDWORKS software. Finite element modeling and analysis were performed using MSC/PATRAN and MSC/NASTRAN software. Linear static analysis was carried out to obtain the stress/strain state results. The mesh convergence analysis was performed to select the best mesh for the analysis. The topology optimization technique is used to achieve the objectives of optimization which {{is to reduce the}} weight of the connecting rod. From the FEA analysis results, TET 10 predicted higher maximum stress than TET 4 and maximum principal stress captured the maximum stress. The <b>crank</b> <b>end</b> is suggested to be redesign based on the topology optimization results. The optimized connecting rod is 11. 7 % lighter and predicted low maximum stress compare to initial design. For future research, the optimization should cover on material optimization to increase the strength of the connecting rod...|$|E
50|$|The {{crankcase}} is {{a single}} cast piece, the drop-forged crankshaft with counter weights screwed on is supported in bearings made of steel-lead-bronze. The crank and shaft pins of the crankshaft are heat-hardened. Due to the air-cooling of the engine, the cylinders have cooling fins made of centrifugal cast metal. The combustion chamber of the engine {{is a part of}} the piston bowls because of the direct injection. The pistons are made of a special highly heat resistant light metal alloy, they have three piston rings and one oil control ring. The connecting rods are cranked as well as the lower <b>crank</b> <b>ends.</b> The lower big <b>crank</b> <b>ends</b> are made of steel-lead-bronze, the upper small <b>crank</b> <b>ends</b> are made of special-bronze. The camshaft is supported by rolling bearings. The overhead valves are pushed by rockers and pushrods. The cylinder head {{is a single}} piece made of low pressure chill cast highly heat resistant light metal alloy. The air filter of the engine is a wet filter. For dusty environments MWM offered an oil bath air filter. The air intake must not draw in hot air; this would reduce the engine power output. The fuel is pumped by a Bosch pump. The fuel pump is controlled by a centrifugal control mechanism using a pushrod. The control trap makes it possible to change the injection time at the engine start-up to pump more fuel into the cylinder. A forced feed lubrication system lubricates the engine, powered by a gear oil pump. The oil is filtered by a strainer in the low pressure circuit and a fine sieve strainer in the high pressure circuit. A gap filter in the high pressure circuit was also available. The cooling is done by an axial cooling fan powered by the crankshaft using a belt. The power can be taken off the flywheel or the PTO-shaft. An electric motor can be used to start the engine as well as a crank. The AKD 112 Z does not have glow plugs but a decompression system.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{connecting}} rod {{is a major}} link inside of a combustion engine. It connects the piston to the crankshaft and is responsible for transferring power from the piston to the crankshaft and sending it to the transmission. There are different types of materials and production methods used {{in the creation of}} {{connecting rod}}s. The most common types of materials used for connecting rods are steel and aluminum. Connecting rods are widely used in variety of engines such as, in-line engines, V-engine, opposed cylinder engines, radial engines and oppose-piston engines. For the project work we have selected connecting rod used in light commercial vehicle of tata motors had recently been launched in the market. We used PRO-E wildfire 4. 0 software for modeling of connecting rod and ANSYS 11 software for analysis. ANSYS Workbench module had been used for analysis of connecting rod. We found out the stresses developed in connecting rod under static loading with different loading conditions of compression and tension at <b>crank</b> <b>end</b> and pin end of connecting rod. We have also designed the connecting rod by machine design approach. Design of connecting rod which is designed by machine design approach is compared with actual production drawing of connecting rod. We found that there is possibility of further reduction in mass of connecting rod...|$|E

Introduction: The test {{was made on}} the boiler and engine at the flour mill of the Long-Barner Milling Company. The boiler was {{installed}} in a great hurry two years ago as the old one was worn out. It is eighteen feet long, seventy-two inches in diameter, and a total heating surface of 1539 square feet. There are thirty-three square feet of grate surface. The boiler was manufactured by Joseph Bromich, of Topeka, and installed in 1905. The fuel used was Weir City nut coal, {{some of the best}} that can be secured here for steaming purposes. A fresh car-load had just been received the week before, and was stored in a covered shed, so that there could be no deterioration by weathering. Power is transmitted by belts from a long engine shaft that runs through the engine room wall to the basement under the mill proper. Speed was taken with a revolution counter and stop watch from the inner end of this shaft. A heavy sixteen foot cast iron fly wheel is on this shaft in the engine room. The engine is of the plain slide valve type. It is a horizontal engine, manufactured by the Atlas Engine Company, and has been in almost continuous service in the basement of this mill for the past twenty-five years. It is rated as a seventy-five. horse power engine. The mechanical clearance in the head end is three-eighths of an inch, while the <b>crank</b> <b>end</b> has but three-sixteenths of an inch.

The victim's arms and legs were tied to ropes which ran through the pulley systems and were attached to <b>cranks</b> at each <b>end</b> of the device. As tension was placed on both ropes, the shoulder (and possibly hip) joints were dislocated. The victim was then violently shoved off of the platform, creating more injuries to joints and muscles, before being beaten to death with rods.|$|R
50|$|Trevithick's first {{high-pressure}} engines from 1801 onwards, {{including his}} locomotives, used the return connecting rod layout in both {{horizontal and vertical}} arrangements. The cylinders were embedded within the boiler, to avoid heat loss, and the short boiler also formed {{the frame of the}} engine. This made the return connecting rod a natural layout, with the crankshaft {{at the opposite end of}} the boiler from the crosshead. The paired connecting rods were relatively simple components, even though two were required. As they also allowed the crankshaft to use two simple overhung <b>cranks</b> on the <b>ends</b> of the shaft, rather than a complex forged crankshaft with an internal crank, this was also a valuable simplification.|$|R

50|$|Every bike {{is made up}} of {{a series}} of components. The {{drive-train}} components are what make the bike go. These consist of the bike chain, front and rear derailleurs, crankset, and bottom bracket. The drive-train is the one part of the bike that doesn't change significantly between road bikes and time-trial bikes. The three main companies that produce component groups are Campagnolo, Shimano, and SRAM. Campagnolo is the oldest of the three, founded in 1933. Component groups are fairly universal on road bikes and time trial bikes. Both use the same group-sets and depending on the rider and the venue of the practice or race, the same gearing might also be used. The cranks are the main component difference between road and time-trial bikes. A standard crank, which is found on road bike, has two chain-rings and a gearing of 53x39, which means that the large chain-ring has 53 teeth on it and the little ring has 39 teeth. The teeth are what grabs the chain and propels the bike forward. A standard time-trial crank typically has a gearing of 54x42 and has solid chain-rings instead of the hollow metal rings found on road <b>cranks.</b> High <b>end</b> time-trial chain-rings are made from solid carbon fiber {{with the exception of the}} teeth.|$|R

The main objective for installing such a system is {{to reduce the risk of}} high cost damage and, thus, increase the overall operational level of safety. However, both the hostile environment inside such large machines and the need for a highly flexible system that easily can be installed and adjusted to different mechanical tolerances have kept exiting solutions form being reliable methods of temperature monitoring on these rotating and orbiting bearings. As an introduction to the main topic of the paper, some selected information on engine damage and causes for such failures - in particular, damage following a detected crosshead and/or crank pin bearing failure situation - have been reviewed. Both indirect and direct methods of bearing temperature measurement are discussed. The main section of the paper describe the applied technical solution for real-time temperature monitoring. The principle of the applied radar technology is presented followed by installation examples and drawings. These are results from both test and permanent installations (refer to ?ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS? at end of paper).

40|$|A {{mechatronic}} chewing robot of 6 -DOF mechanism {{which consists}} mainly of the skull, six <b>crank</b> actuators, <b>end</b> effector and motion control {{system has been}} designed and is required to simulate human chewing behaviours while the chewed food properties are evaluated. The robotic mechanism is proposed and its kinematic parameters are defined according to the biomechanical findings and measurements of the human masticatory system. This thesis {{is concerned with the}} design and implementation of trajectory tracking control for robotic jaw actuators via Galil motion controller. The aim of this project is to simulate the dynamics behaviour and force-motion control of the robot, and to quantitatively assess food texture changes during chewing. A control system based Galil motion control card has been formed to achieve the motion of simulated human mastication. Some real human mastication motion have been tracked and used as targeted trajectories for the robot to reproduce. Several experiments have been executed to measure the jaw movements and chewing forces. To reduce the vibration of the actuators and protect sensitive linkage part of the robot, the traditional PID control and some advanced control theories were implemented to achieve most effective efforts. A mathematical model was also designed at the first stage when a test actuator powered by brushless motor was formed; however, it is finally proven not well controlled in either mechanical and control ways. Major features of the built robot including the motion control system are presented and tested. Experimental results including free chewing, soft-food and hard-food chewing are given where the foods are simulated by foam and hard objects. Also the joint actuations and driving torques required are compared for the chewing of different foods. In conclusion, tracking motion control has been attempted on the physical robot and a solution to the trajectory control has been developed...|$|R

40|$|Independent cranks (IC) are {{recently}} introduced bicycle cranks that are decoupled; therefore allowing each leg to pedal {{independent of the}} other. Despite this introduction, limited {{research has been conducted}} assessing biomechanical changes when cycling with IC. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to evaluate and compare trunk kinematics and surface electromyography (sEMG) during IC and normal crank (NC) cycling during a graded exercise test to volitional fatigue. Ten healthy, physically active men performed two tests (IC and NC) on a cycling ergometer on separate days. 3 D motion capture data of the trunk and pelvis and sEMG of the latissimus dorsi, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius lateral head, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis and the biceps femoris were collected bilaterally. The first 30 seconds (beginning) and the last 30 seconds (end) of each trial were analyzed with respect to external load (beginning vs <b>end),</b> <b>crank</b> type (IC vs NC) side (left vs right), and phase of the pedal cycle (push vs recovery). Mean load at volitional fatigue in NC (351 W) was significantly greater than IC (318 W; p < 0. 001). As external load increased, there was a similar increase in spine flexion angle in the sagittal plane for both NC (8. 2 °) and IC (4. 6 °). The NC condition demonstrated significantly greater increase in muscle activation from the beginning to the end than the IC condition in the tibialis anterior, rectus femoris and biceps femoris in the push phase, and the rectus femoris and biceps femoris in the recovery phase. As IC demonstrated less increase in activation, they cause less variation in muscular contraction from beginning to end throughout the full pedal range of motion, yet do not alter gross trunk kinematics. Due to altered muscle activation patterns when cycling with IC, they are proposed as a potentially beneficial training tool to increase training diversity...|$|R
