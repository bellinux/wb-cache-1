40|$|We {{describe}} an analytic {{continuation of the}} Euclidean Grosse-Wulkenhaar and LSZ models which defines a one-parameter family of duality covariant noncommutative field theories interpolating between Euclidean and Minkowski space versions of these models, and provides an alternative regularization to the usual Feynman prescription. This regularization allows for a matrix model representation of the field theories {{in terms of a}} complex generalization of the usual basis of Landau wavefunctions. The corresponding propagators are calculated and identified with the Feynman propagators of the field theories. The regulated quantum field theories are shown to be UV/IR-duality covariant. We study the asymptotics of the regularized propagators in position and matrix space representations, and confirm that they generically possess a comparably good decay behaviour as in the Euclidean case.

40|$|We {{recently}} formulated a {{model of}} the universe based on an underlying W 3 -symmetry. It allows the creation of the universe from nothing and the creation of baby universes and wormholes for spacetimes of dimension 2, 3, 4, 6 and 10. Here we show that the classical large time and large space limit of these universes is one of exponential fast expansion without the need of a cosmological constant. Under a number of simplifying assumptions our model predicts that w=- 1. 2 in the case of four-dimensional spacetime. The possibility of obtaining a w-value less than - 1 is linked to the ability of our model to create baby universes and wormholes. Comment: <b>Clarifying</b> <b>comment</b> on page...|$|E

40|$|We use the {{additional}} variables of suitably enlarged superspaces to write new actions for extended objects, with kappa-symmetry, {{in such a}} way that the tension emerges from them as an integration constant. Our actions correspond to the spacetime scale-invariant ones previously considered by Bergshoeff et al. once the worldvolume forms introduced there are reinterpreted in terms of fields associated with the coordinates of the enlarged superspaces. It is shown that the kappa-symmetry of the new actions is given by a certain type of right local transformations of the extended superspace groups. Further, we also show that the enlarged superspaces that allow for strictly invariant Wess-Zumino terms also lead to strict kappa-invariance i. e., the Lagrangian itself (not only the action) is both supersymmetry- and kappa-invariant.

40|$|We analyze {{further the}} IR {{singularities}} {{that appear in}} noncommutative field theories on R^d. We argue that all IR singularities in nonplanar one loop diagrams may be interpreted as arising from the tree level exchanges of new light degrees of freedom, one coupling to each relevant operator. These exchanges are reminiscent of closed string exchanges in the double twist diagrams in open string theory. Some of these degrees of freedom are required to have propagators that are inverse linear or logarithmic. We suggest that these {{can be interpreted as}} free propagators in one or two extra dimensions respectively. We also calculate some of the IR singular terms appearing at two loops in noncommutative scalar field theories and find a complicated momentum dependence which is more difficult to interpret.
