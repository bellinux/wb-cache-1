The greenish red hypocotyl is hairy, as are the stems of young plants. The hairy seedling leaves are crowded and oppositely arranged. They measure 0.7–1.3cm (0.2–0.5in) in length and have recurved margins. Young plants often begin branching within {{their first year of}} life.|$|E

25|$|In monocot seeds, the embryo's radicle and <b>cotyledon</b> {{are covered}} by a coleorhiza and coleoptile, respectively. The coleorhiza is the first part to grow out of the seed, {{followed}} by the radicle. The coleoptile is then pushed up through the ground until it reaches the surface. There, it stops elongating and the first leaves emerge.|$|E
40|$|The protein {{metabolism}} of <b>cotyledons</b> {{attached to}} the embryonic axis has been compared with that in <b>cotyledons</b> removed from the axis at the initiation of a 6 -day imbibition. Total protein declined in the attached {{but not in the}} detached <b>cotyledons.</b> Concurrent with the decline in protein level in the intact <b>cotyledons</b> there was an increased capacity to incorporate exogenously supplied leucine into protein. In contrast, detached <b>cotyledons</b> showed a restricted capacity for protein synthesis. It was demonstrated that ribosomal preparations from <b>cotyledons</b> of intact seedlings contained an increasing proportion of polyribosomes as germination progressed and such ribosomes were active in in vitro amino acid incorporation. Ribosomal preparations from detached <b>cotyledons</b> contained few polyribosomes and had a restricted capacity to incorporate amino acids in vitro. The in vitro incorporation of phenylalanine was stimulated by polyuridylic acid with the stimulation being greatest in ribosomal preparations from detached <b>cotyledons.</b> The results suggest that an axis component may regulate the availability of messenger RNA in the <b>cotyledons</b> during germination...|$|R
40|$|Intracellular {{substances}} leak from imbibing <b>cotyledons</b> {{of grain}} legumes during imbibition. This work reports {{the discovery of}} a biophysical process by which intracellular substances are driven from <b>cotyledons</b> during imbibition. Light and scanning electron microscopy were used to examine bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and pea (Pisum sativum L.) <b>cotyledons</b> and the material released from them into imbibition water. A large fraction of the visible materials released from excised bean and pea <b>cotyledons</b> during the first 30 minutes of imbibition consisted of convoluted or helical streams of material which rapidly emerged from the <b>cotyledons</b> surfaces. Large streams of material from bean <b>cotyledons</b> contained starch grains and protein bodies, and smaller streams from bean and pea <b>cotyledons</b> probably contained protein bodies. The forms of streams were characteristic of a viscous fluid which had been forced by pressure through irregular orifices. The sites of extrusion from bean <b>cotyledons</b> were multicellular blisters which formed on the surfaces of imbibing <b>cotyledons.</b> In 6 hours, pea and bean <b>cotyledons</b> leaked from 1 to 11 micrograms protein per milligram of seed dry weight. The quantities of protein leaked primarily depended on cultivar...|$|R
40|$|In radish, {{the level}} of {{transcripts}} from the cytosolic glutamine synthetase (GS 1) gene (Glnl;l) increased as the <b>cotyledons</b> aged and senesced. After the transfer to dark-ness, {{the level of}} transcripts from Glnl;l in senescing (3 weeks after germination) <b>cotyledons</b> which was abundant before transfer, increased, but that in young (1 week after germination) <b>cotyledons</b> which was very low before trans-fer, did not. On the contrary, transcripts from the aspara-gine synthetase (AS) gene accumulated after the transfer to darkness in young <b>cotyledons</b> but not in senescing <b>cotyledons.</b> The amount of free Gin in the phloem exudates collected from the <b>cotyledons</b> increased during senescence when the Glnl;l transcripts accumulated in the <b>cotyledons.</b> The accumulation of AS transcripts, however, led {{to the increase in}} the level of Asn in the <b>cotyledons</b> rather than in the phloem exudates from the <b>cotyledons.</b> These data sug-gest that the synthesis of Gin is related to the translocation of nitrogen from senescing <b>cotyledons,</b> whereas that of Asn is involved in the transient nitrogen storage in the tissue, and also that the synthesis of these amino acids is de-pendent on the expression of genes for synthetases of these amino acids...|$|R
25|$|Monocotyledonous {{plants have}} two {{additional}} {{structures in the}} form of sheaths. The plumule is covered with a coleoptile that forms the first leaf while the radicle is covered with a coleorhiza that connects to the primary root and adventitious roots form from the sides. Here the hypocotyl is a rudimentary axis between radicle and plumule. The seeds of corn are constructed with these structures; pericarp, scutellum (single large <b>cotyledon)</b> that absorbs nutrients from the endosperm, plumule, radicle, coleoptile and coleorhiza—these last two structures are sheath-like and enclose the plumule and radicle, acting as a protective covering.|$|E
25|$|In endospermic seeds, {{there are}} two {{distinct}} regions inside the seed coat, an upper and larger endosperm and a lower smaller embryo. The embryo is the fertilised ovule, an immature plant from which a new plant will grow under proper conditions. The embryo has one <b>cotyledon</b> or seed leaf in monocotyledons, two cotyledons in almost all dicotyledons and two or more in gymnosperms. In the fruit of grains (caryopses) the single monocotyledon is shield shaped and hence called a scutellum. The scutellum is pressed closely against the endosperm from which it absorbs food, and passes it to the growing parts. Embryo descriptors include small, straight, bent, curved and curled.|$|E
500|$|The <b>cotyledon</b> {{leaves are}} a dull green with no visible nerves or markings. Transversely {{elliptic}} in shape, they measure 8 to 13mm long by 12 to 18mm wide and range from convex to concave. The pointed spreading auricles are 1.5mm long. The <b>cotyledon</b> leaves sit atop the stout hypocotyl, which is green and smooth. The seedling leaves are crowded above the cotyledons. Resembling those of B. coccinea, they {{are lined with}} triangular lobes or [...] "teeth" [...] (with a u- or v-shaped sinus) and obovate to broadly lanceolate in shape. The first set of leaves measure [...] in length and around [...] in width, {{with three or four}} lobes in each margin. Both upper and lower seedling leaf surfaces are covered in spreading hairs, as is the seedling stem. Juvenile leaves are obovate to truncate or mucronate with triangular lobes and measure [...] long by [...] wide. These lobes are smaller toward the petiole and apex of the leaf.|$|E
40|$|Developmental {{patterns}} of α-amylase in Vigna radiata <b>cotyledons</b> during and following germination were quite different {{depending on the}} differences in the treatments of <b>cotyledons</b> during the imbibitional stage. When axis-detached <b>cotyledons</b> were imbibed in water with seed-coats attached, α-amylase activity did not increase and remained low. On the other hand, when the <b>cotyledons</b> were imbibed in water after seed-coat removal, the enzyme activity increased markedly. If the axis was attached to the <b>cotyledons,</b> α-amylase showed a marked development even under the former imbibition conditions. These changes in the enzyme activity were in parallel with those in the enzyme content, and the content, in turn, was dependent upon the availability of mRNA for α-amylase. We propose that the regulation of the development of α-amylase in <b>cotyledons</b> may involve some factor(s) inhibitory to accumulation of α-amylase mRNA, which is present in dry <b>cotyledons</b> and can be removed from <b>cotyledons</b> by leakage or by the presence of the axis...|$|R

40|$|Japanese {{black pine}} (Pinus thunbergii) <b>cotyledons</b> {{were found to}} {{synthesize}} chlorophylls in complete darkness during germination, although the synthesis was not as great as that in the light. The compositions of thylakoid components in plastids of <b>cotyledons</b> grown {{in the dark and}} light were compared using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns of polypeptides and spectroscopic determination of membrane redox components. All thylakoid membrane proteins found in preparations from light-grown <b>cotyledons</b> were also present in preparations from dark-grown <b>cotyledons.</b> However, levels of photosystem I, photosystem II, cytochrome b[ill]/f, and light-harvesting chlorophyll-protein complexes in dark-grown <b>cotyledons</b> were only one-fourth of those in light-grown <b>cotyledons,</b> on a fresh weight basis. These results suggest that the low abundance of thylakoid components in dark-grown <b>cotyledons</b> is associated with the limited supply of chlorophyll needed to assemble the two photosystem complexes and the light-harvesting chlorophyll-protein complex...|$|R
500|$|Seed {{germination}} is remote tubular—during germination, as the <b>cotyledon</b> expands {{it pushes}} the young shoot {{away from the}} seed. After germination, the stem initially grows downward before turning to grow upward and produce the aboveground stem. This produces a [...] "saxophone shaped" [...] belowground portion of the stem. The fact that the shoot tips of Attalea seedlings are underground it likely to contribute to their fire-tolerance.|$|E
500|$|Seed {{germination}} is adjacent ligular—during germination, as the <b>cotyledon</b> expands it only {{pushes a}} portion of the embryo out of the seed. [...] As a result, the seedling develops adjacent to the seed. [...] The embryo forms a ligule, and the plumule protrudes from this. [...] Seedlings in cultivation are reported to begin producing a stem two years after germination, at the point where they produce their thirteenth leaf.

Heads average between , with fast-growing, earlier-maturing varieties producing smaller heads. Most cabbages have thick, alternating leaves, with margins that range from wavy or lobed to highly dissected; some varieties have a waxy bloom on the leaves. Plants have root systems that are fibrous and shallow. About 90 percent of the root mass is in the upper [...] of soil; some lateral roots can penetrate up to [...] deep.|$|E
40|$|The {{regulation}} of cotyledon-specific gene expression by exogenously applied abscisic acid (ABA) was studied in developing cultured <b>cotyledons</b> of soybean (Glycine max L. Merr. cv Provar). When immature <b>cotyledons</b> were cultured in modified Thompson's medium, {{the addition of}} ABA resulted in an increased concentration of the β-subunit of β-conglycinin, {{one of the major}} storage proteins of soybean seeds. The amount of the α′-and α-subunits of β-conglycinin was relatively unaffected by the ABA treatment. When fluridone, an inhibitor of carotenoid biosynthesis that has been shown to decrease ABA levels in plant tissues, was added to the medium the level of ABA and the β-subunit decreased in the <b>cotyledons.</b> Increasing the concentration of sucrose in the culture medium caused an increase in the concentration of ABA and β-subunit in the <b>cotyledons.</b> When in vitro translation products from RNA isolated from <b>cotyledons</b> cultured with ABA were immunoprecipitated with antiserum against β-conglycinin, there was an increased amount of pre-β-subunit polypetide compared to the translation products from RNA isolated from control <b>cotyledons.</b> The pre-β-subunit polypeptide was not detected in translation products from RNA isolated from fluridone-treated <b>cotyledons.</b> Nucleic acid hybridization reactions showed that the level of β-subunit mRNA was higher in ABA-treated <b>cotyledons</b> compared to the control, and was lower in the fluridone-treated <b>cotyledons.</b> We have shown that exogenous ABA is able to modulate the accumulation of the β-subunit of β-conglycinin in developing cultured soybean <b>cotyledons...</b>|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: A small placental {{surface at}} birth {{has been shown}} to be {{associated}} with the development of hypertension in later life. In this study we extend this observation by looking at the relationship between the number of placental <b>cotyledons</b> and blood pressure in childhood. Because the number of <b>cotyledons</b> is correlated with the surface area, we hypothesized that fewer <b>cotyledons</b> would be associated with higher blood pressure. METHODS: The Alspac study is a longitudinal study of 13, 971 children born in Bristol. Their placentas were stored in formalin. We photographed the placentas of a sample of the children and related the number of maternal <b>cotyledons</b> to their blood pressure levels at age 9 years. RESULTS: Contrary to our hypothesis, a greater number of maternal <b>cotyledons</b> was associated with higher blood pressure. Among boys, a greater number of <b>cotyledons</b> was associated with higher systolic and diastolic pressure but not with higher pulse pressure. Diastolic pressure rose by 2. 2  mmHg (95 % CI 0. 6 to 3. 7, p =  0. 007) for every 10 additional <b>cotyledons.</b> Among girls, a greater number of <b>cotyledons</b> was associated with higher systolic pressure and pulse pressure but not with higher diastolic pressure. Pulse pressure rose by 2. 7  mmHg (1. 1 - 4. 3, p <  0. 001) for every 10 additional <b>cotyledons.</b> These associations were little changed by adjustment for placental surface area. CONCLUSION: Our study has shown that a large number of maternal <b>cotyledons</b> is associated with raised blood pressure in childhood. The associations differ in the two sexes...|$|R
40|$|In {{cork oak}} (Quercus suber L.), {{recurrent}} embryogenesis {{is produced in}} vitro through autoembryony without exogenous plant growth regulators (PGRs); secondary embryos appear on the embryo axis but seldom on <b>cotyledons.</b> Focusing mainly on the histological origin of neoformations, we investigated {{the influence of the}} embryo axis and exogenous PGRs on the embryogenic potential of somatic embryo <b>cotyledons.</b> Isolated <b>cotyledons</b> of somatic embryos became necrotic when cultured on PGR-free medium but gave secondary embryos when cultured on media containing benzyladenine and naphthaleneacetic acid. <b>Cotyledons</b> of cork oak somatic embryos are competent to give embryogenic responses.

For <b>cotyledons</b> abraded with carborundum or cut into either eight or 18 pieces, we detected no zeatin-enhanced acidification of the growth medium during growth periods of 3 days. Measurements of pH values on each surface of zeatin-treated, abraded <b>cotyledons</b> after 3 days of growth also showed no detectable acidification caused by the hormone. Furthermore, with several buffers at pH values ranging from 5 to 8, growth of nonabraded, abraded, or cut <b>cotyledons</b> with or without zeatin was independent of external pH. However, experiments restricted to about 12 hours indicated that certain acidic buffers enhanced growth of <b>cotyledons</b> cut into 18 pieces. Lastly, concentrations of fusicoccin that caused growth promotion equal to that of zeatin initiated substantial acidification of the medium.

500|$|The complex flower spikes, {{known as}} inflorescences, appear {{generally}} from late summer to early winter (February to June) in New South Wales and Victoria, although flowering occurs in late autumn and {{winter in the}} Gibraltar Range.

40|$|Decapitation of {{the shoot}} apex of {{seedlings}} of Helianthus annuus Lin. above the cotyledonary node brought about promotion {{of growth in}} the <b>cotyledons.</b> Potassium level in the <b>cotyledons</b> of decapitated plants was higher, and that of sodium lower, than in those of intact plants. IAA applied to the cut stem surface imitated the effects of the apex. Application of kinetin to the <b>cotyledons</b> antagonized the apex or the auxin in their influence on growth and cation level. Labeled IAA applied to the cut stem surface penetrated into the <b>cotyledons</b> in significant amounts. It was concluded that growth and monovalent cation level in the <b>cotyledons</b> are regulated by auxin released from the shoot apex and that {{at least part of the}} auxin effect is exerted directly in the <b>cotyledons.</b> A function of the apex as a sink for cytokinins may also be involved in the control mechanism...|$|R
