Rapid changes in mean arterial pressure cause transient changes in CBF before autoregulatory factors return flow toward previous levels. Myocardial oxygen consumption (MVo 2) appears to be the major determinant of CBF and the factors determining MVo 2 (mainly developed tension and contractile state) are, therefore, major determinants of CBF. The direct effects of autonomic excitation on CBF appear relatively minor, however; the vagus, sympathetic nerves and adrenal medullary hormones profoundly alter CBF indirectly through changes in MVo 2. In the eschaemic heart with atheromatous occlusion of large vessels there is a reduced capacity for autoregulation, and nutrient flow is more dependent on pressure gradient. Hypertension and valvular disorders are often associated with raised MVo 2 but associated abnormalities in pressure gradient and resistance to flow often hinder the supply of CBF needed to meet high demands...|$|R

30|$|Four {{water deficit}} {{treatments}} {{were applied to}} the experimental trees. Irrigation was applied using drip sprinklers until soil moisture capacity was reached. The first treatment was ‘well-watered’ with applications of water applied weekly between October and May (spring to autumn), and fortnightly between June and September (winter). The second treatment simulated ‘extended summer drought’ whereby water was withheld between November and April to allow drying of the soil profile. The drought was interrupted by the small, single application of water on March 1 to prevent tree mortality. Although predawn needle water potentials were not particularly low at this time, the trees had started showing large physical changes to continued drought. During {{the remainder of the}} year, water was applied at the same times as the well-watered treatment. The third and fourth treatments simulated ‘early-season cyclical drought’ and ‘late-season cyclical drought’, respectively. The early-season cyclical drought treatment was applied between October and January (spring/early summer), while the late-season cyclical drought treatment was applied between February and May (late summer/autumn). These treatments were timed to coincide with periods of expected early- and latewood development. Trees in these treatments were subjected to a series of drying <b>cycles</b> <b>interrupted</b> by water replenishment when needle water potential had fallen to approximately − 0.5  MPa or lower. The early-season drought trees were re-watered on November 7, December 1, December 26 and January 16, while the late-season drought trees were re-watered on February 20, March 13 and April 19. This water potential was sufficient to generate a depressed growth response as previously observed in non-experimental trees. When not subject to the cyclical watering treatments between the stated months, water for both treatments was applied at the same times as that for the well-watered treatment. The length of time between watering for the cyclical drought treatments depended upon the time of year and air temperature. The time between watering varied from three to seven weeks during the October to May period. These cycles were expected to create large fluctuations in needle water potential.|$|R
