5|$|Gregory's {{temperament}} {{is said to}} {{be quiet}} and meek, in <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> brother Basil who was known to be much more outspoken.|$|E
5|$|In <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> defenders, the {{national}} press were almost unanimous in their condemnation of Lucan. Their leader-writers ignored the threat of libel and identified him as Rivett's killer.|$|E
5|$|In <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> father, who was {{perceived}} as having troubles with an overarching unifying theme, Bush embraced larger visions and {{was seen as a}} man of larger ideas and associated huge risks.|$|E
25|$|And last, the Carmen de speciebus (“Song of Species”), a 78-line Latin hexameter poem on pharmacology, which Marcellus <b>contrasts</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> prose {{assemblage}} of prescriptions by asserting his originality in writing it.|$|R
25|$|Rationalism {{has been}} criticized by William James for being {{out of touch with}} reality. He also criticized rationalism for {{representing}} the universe as a closed system, which <b>contrasts</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> view that the universe is an open system.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a {{universal}} failing, Mrs. Wilkins," [...] I explained. [...] "If you talk to a travelled Frenchman, he <b>contrasts</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own satisfaction the Paris ouvrier in his blue blouse {{with the appearance of}} the London labourer." ...|$|R
5|$|In <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> public image, Rose {{was not a}} heavy drug user, {{though he}} did not disavow the use of illicit {{substances}} entirely.|$|E
5|$|In the afternoon, Sheaffe {{arrived on}} the {{battlefield}} with reinforcements and took command of the British forces. In sharp <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> predecessors' direct attacks, Sheaffe took a more cautious approach. This ultimately proved successful, leading to a total victory over the Americans.|$|E
5|$|Reinfeldt {{had during}} his second term, in <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> first term, no major {{international}} engagement. Contacts with other politicians, however, remained good, {{which was also}} marked by Barack Obama's visit to Stockholm in September 2013.|$|E
50|$|The series {{rode the}} {{momentum}} of creator Ross Bagdasarian, Sr.'s original hit musical gimmick and developed the singing Chipmunk trio as rambunctious kids - particularly the show's namesake star - whose mischief <b>contrasted</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> tall, brainy brother Simon and his chubby, gluttonous brother Theodore, {{as well as their}} long-suffering, perpetually put-upon manager-father figure, David Seville. The animation was produced by Herbert Klynn's Format Films.|$|R
5000|$|Rasmus Berg, a Danish farmer's son, {{has been}} given a costly {{education}} in Copenhagen. When he returns, he speaks Latin <b>to</b> <b>his</b> parents, and Latinises his name as Erasmus Montanus. He wants to [...] "dispute", and goes on to [...] "prove" [...] a number of absurdities, such as relying on argument from ignorance <b>to</b> prove that <b>his</b> mother is a rock. He is <b>contrasted</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> brother Jacob who is only interested in knowledge which is of practical application.|$|R
50|$|Fox News Channel {{political}} commentator Megyn Kelly criticized President Obama's {{silence on}} Steinle's killing, <b>contrasting</b> it <b>to</b> <b>his</b> direct {{comments on the}} deaths of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Freddie Gray.|$|R
5|$|Alexander {{was also}} noted for his {{nepotism}} that was partially {{due to his}} advanced age and belief that his family would have little time to profit from his reign. This was in <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> predecessor Innocent XI, who was known for being austere and had not caused any scandals through nepotism.|$|E
5|$|Federer is {{also noted}} for his cool {{demeanour}} and emotional {{control on the}} court. In <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> early career, most of his professional game has been characterised by lack of outbursts or emotional frustration at errors, which gives him an advantage over less controlled opponents.|$|E
5|$|In <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> usual {{practice}} {{elsewhere in}} the Historia ecclesiastica, Bede provides no information about his sources for the Cædmon story. Since a similar paucity of sources is also characteristic of other stories from Whitby Abbey in his work, this may indicate that his knowledge of Cædmon's life was based on tradition current at his home monastery in (relatively) nearby Wearmouth-Jarrow.|$|E
5000|$|Evangelical clergymen in Trollope's novels were {{generally}} portrayed as [...] "self-righteous, dictatorial, intolerant, and decidedly not gentlemen". Examples include Obadiah Slope of Barchester Towers, Samuel Prong of Rachel Ray, and Jeremiah Maguire of Miss Mackenzie. In The Claverings, however, Henry Clavering's curate Samuel Saul {{is depicted as}} [...] "an Evangelical of courage, zeal, and selflessness". <b>His</b> diligence is <b>contrasted</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> rector's idleness; and Trollope rewards him with the hand of Fanny Clavering, Harry's sister, and with the living of the parish upon Henry Clavering's accession to the baronetcy.|$|R
5000|$|Nathaniel Ames, {{a second}} {{generation}} colonial American, established and wrote Ames' Almanac. [...] Ames was only seventeen {{when the first}} almanac was printed. The family also owned Ames Tavern and often advertised the establishment in the almanac. [...] Upon Ames' death in 1764, his son, also Nathaniel, began writing the almanac. He continued to print the almanac until 1775. [...] The younger Nathaniel strongly supported the antifederalist cause, which <b>contrasted</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> brother, the prominent Federalist congressman Fisher Ames. Based on a correspondence between Ames and Roger Sherman, it appears that Sherman wrote some of the mathematical portions of the almanac in 1753.|$|R
50|$|The LP, in <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> many of <b>his</b> more avant-garde {{recordings}} of the same time frame, is a set that consists of jazz standards.|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} with Sigebert, Ecgric {{seems to have}} remained a pagan. There {{is no evidence that}} he was baptised or that he promoted Christianity in East Anglia, according to D. P. Kirby, who notes that Bede wrote nothing that could imply that Ecgric was a Christian, in <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> praise of Sigeberht’s efforts to establish Christianity in East Anglia.|$|E
5|$|Khafaja was {{succeeded by}} his son Muhammad, elected by the Sicilian army and {{confirmed}} by the Aghlabid emir. In <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> previous energy, Muhammad was a sedentary governor, preferring to remain in his capital rather than campaign in person. His tenure was furthermore cut short when he was assassinated by his court eunuchs on 27 May 871.|$|E
5|$|Alexander's army {{crossed the}} Hellespont in 334BC with {{approximately}} 48,100 soldiers, 6,100 cavalry and {{a fleet of}} 120 ships with crews numbering 38,000, drawn from Macedon and various Greek city-states, mercenaries, and feudally raised soldiers from Thrace, Paionia, and Illyria. He showed his intent to conquer {{the entirety of the}} Persian Empire by throwing a spear into Asian soil and saying he accepted Asia as a gift from the gods. This also showed Alexander's eagerness to fight, in <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> father's preference for diplomacy.|$|E
50|$|Mongkut also {{improved}} women's {{rights in}} Siam. He released {{a large number}} of royal concubines to find their own husbands, in <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> how <b>his</b> story has been dramatized. He banned forced marriages of all kinds and the selling of one's wife to pay off a debt.|$|R

5|$|Davidson was {{recalled}} for the Fourth Test, {{but managed}} only a wicket as England sealed the series 4–1. However, he {{then took a}} total of 6/68 as New South Wales defeated England; {{it was only the}} second time the tourists had lost for the summer. Davidson was retained for the final Test, his first on his home ground in Sydney, but was wicketless in a rain-affected draw. His Test series had been poor, with 71runs at 14.20 and only three wickets at 73.33 as England retained the Ashes 3–1. Davidson had not tasted victory in any of his eight Tests. His poor Test form <b>contrasted</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> performances against England in tour matches; he took 15 wicket at 15.13 in three matches outside the Tests.|$|R
5|$|Although Harvey {{started as}} a wicketkeeper at school, he became a highly {{regarded}} cover fielder and later in his international career became an agile slips catcher. He bowled off spin from a three to four pace approach on rare occasions, taking only three wickets in his Test career. Away from the field, Harvey had a quiet and unassuming manner, in complete <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> dynamic batting, and his non-smoking, non-drinking set him apart from the prevailing cricket culture of his period. Harvey {{was known for his}} respect for umpiring decisions and for never appealing for leg before wicket when he fielded in the slips.|$|E
5|$|Cecil B. DeMille {{released}} This Day and Age in 1933, and {{it stands}} in stark <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> other {{films of the}} period. Filmed shortly after DeMille had completed a five-month tour of the Soviet Union, This Day and Age takes place in America and features several children torturing a gangster who got away {{with the murder of}} a popular local shopkeeper. The youngsters are seen lowering the gangster into a vat of rats when the police arrive, and their response is to encourage the youths to continue this. The film ends with the youngsters taking the gangster to a local judge and forcing the magistrate to conduct a trial in which the outcome is never in doubt.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (seasons 1–present, main) {{is portrayed}} by Gillian Anderson. Scully is an FBI special agent, a medical doctor, and {{scientist}} who is Mulder's partner. In <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> credulity, Scully is a skeptic, basing her beliefs on scientific explanations. However, despite her otherwise rigid skepticism, {{she is a}} Catholic, and her faith {{plays an important role}} in several episodes. As the series progresses, she becomes more open to the possibility of paranormal happenings. In the latter part of the eighth season, her position in the X-Files office is taken by Agent Monica Reyes, and Scully moves to Quantico to teach new FBI agents. She appeared in both The X-Files feature films.|$|E
5|$|The Nation Alliance Party {{was founded}} in June 2007 by four people: realtor Wei Ping Chen of Delta, renovator Steven Lian from Surrey, tourism guide Randy Liu from Burnaby, and Simon Fraser University student Locan Wang. Party leader Wei Ping Chen had immigrated to Canada from Beijing, via Australia. He {{witnessed}} the challenges that recent immigrants faced once in a new country, and how uninvolved they were in politics. <b>Contrasted</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> experience in China, Wei Ping Chen {{was impressed with the}} political freedoms available in Canada and felt motivated to start a political party. He felt that political campaigns oriented towards recent immigrants and people whose first language is not English, would empower those communities to become more politically active.|$|R

5|$|During {{the first}} innings, Brown captained Australia while Bradman was absent with fibrositis. The {{tourists}} fell for 331, with debutants Sam Loxton and Doug Ring taking three wickets apiece. India eventually fell to another innings defeat, so Brown {{did not have}} another opportunity to score a Test century on home soil. His Test aggregate in Australia stood at 223 runs at only 33.86, in <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> away average of 1,369 runs at 50.70. His first-class batting average of 43.58 for the season was inferior to that of Barnes and Morris, both of whom averaged more than 50.|$|E
5|$|Eddie Costa {{was born}} in Atlas, Pennsylvania, near Mount Carmel, in Northumberland County. He was taught and {{influenced}} on piano by his older, musically trained brother, Bill, and a local piano teacher. Eddie took paid jobs as a pianist {{from the age of}} 15. In <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> piano training, he was self-taught on vibes. In 1949 Costa played and toured for a few months with violinist Joe Venuti. He then worked for his brother in New York until, in 1951, Eddie was drafted into the army. During his time in the armed forces, Costa performed in Japan and Korea. Upon release after two years, Costa again worked around the New York area, including for bands led by Kai Winding, Johnny Smith, and Don Elliott.|$|E
5|$|In about 630, Christianity was {{permanently}} re-established in East Anglia when Sigeberht and Ecgric succeeded to rule jointly. Ecgric, who {{may have}} been a sub-king until the abdication of Sigeberht in around 634, seems to have remained a pagan. There is no evidence that Ecgric adopted or promoted Christianity: Bede wrote nothing to imply that he was a Christian, in <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> praise of the devout Sigeberht, the first English king to receive a Christian baptism and education before his succession.|$|E
50|$|However, {{his long}} service stands in stark <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> that of <b>his</b> predecessor, Bernard Kerik. Kerik {{served as an}} NYPD officer for only 8 years before he was {{appointed}} commissioner by Mayor Rudy Giuliani.|$|R
60|$|When Mary {{asked him}} what he thought of Polly's playing, an unbidden <b>contrast</b> leaped <b>to</b> <b>his</b> mind. Mary's music {{reminded}} him of church. It was cold and bare as a Methodist meeting house. But Polly's was like the mad and lawless ceremonial of some heathen temple where incense arose and nautch girls writhed.|$|R
50|$|Wernicke's {{clear and}} {{rationale}} diction stands in <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> that of <b>his</b> contemporaries Christian Hoffmann von Hoffmannswaldau and Christian Heinrich Postel. Wernicke was openly hostile to Christian Friedrich Hunold. He died in Copenhagen in 1725.|$|R
