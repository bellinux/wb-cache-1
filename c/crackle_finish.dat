5000|$|Zippo {{lighters}} {{became popular}} in the United States military, especially during World War IIâ€”when, as the company's web site says, Zippo [...] "ceased production of lighters for consumer markets and dedicated all manufacturing to the US military". [...] Period Zippos were made of brass, but Zippo used a black <b>crackle</b> <b>finished</b> steel {{during the war years}} because of metal shortages. While the Zippo Manufacturing Company never had an official contract with the military, soldiers and armed forces personnel insisted that base exchange (BX) and post exchange (PX) stores carry this sought-after lighter. [...] While it had previously been common to have Zippos with authorized badges, unit crests, and division insignias, it became popular among the American soldiers of the Vietnam War to get their Zippos engraved with personal mottos. These lighters are now sought after collector's items and popular souvenirs for visitors to Vietnam.|$|R
