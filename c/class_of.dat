40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to develop a}} general {{mechanism}} for the construction of codes and to extract general properties <b>of</b> <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> codes. This mechanism makes it unnecessary to study various <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> codes separately [...] at least to some extent [...] by different constructions and properties.;To achieve this goal, the mechanism <b>of</b> characterizing <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> languages by binary relations is studied. Some general properties related to binary relations and languages are obtained. Moreover, three new <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> codes, n-shuffle codes, solid codes, and intercodes are constructed. Solid codes and intercodes have the synchronous decoding property which is very useful in the design of circuits of coders and decoders.;The studies of codes, n-codes, and intercodes indicate that these three <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> codes cannot be characterized by binary relations. We introduce a more general mechanism, that is, to characterize <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> languages by finitary relations. This mechanism can be used to characterize more <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> languages, such as the <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> n-codes and intercodes. Sometimes, it is difficult to show inclusion relations between <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> codes and hierarchy properties <b>of</b> <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> codes.

5|$|In 1923, John von Neumann {{developed}} an axiom system that eliminates the paradoxes {{by using an}} approach similar to Cantor's—namely, by identifying collections that are not sets and treating them differently. Von Neumann stated that a class is too big to be a set {{if it can be}} put into one-to-one correspondence with the <b>class</b> <b>of</b> all sets. He defined a set as a class that is a member of some class and stated the axiom: A class is not a set if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and the <b>class</b> <b>of</b> all sets. This axiom implies that these big classes are not sets, which eliminates the paradoxes since they cannot be members of any class. Von Neumann also used his axiom to prove the well-ordering theorem: Like Cantor, he assumed that the ordinals form a set. The resulting contradiction implies that the <b>class</b> <b>of</b> all ordinals is not a set. Then his axiom provides a one-to-one correspondence between this class and the <b>class</b> <b>of</b> all sets. This correspondence well-orders the <b>class</b> <b>of</b> all sets, which implies the well-ordering theorem. In 1930, Zermelo defined models of set theory that satisfy von Neumann's axiom.|$|E
