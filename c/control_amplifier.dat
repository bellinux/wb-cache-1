40|$|The plasma {{vertical}} position {{system on the}} COMPASS–D tokamak is studied in this thesis. An analogue P+D controller is used to regulate the plasma {{vertical position}} which is open loop unstable. Measurements from inside the vessel are used for the derivative component of the control signal and external measurements for the proportional component. Two main sources of disturbances are observed on COMPASS–D. One source is 600 Hz noise from thyristor power supplies which cause large oscillations at the <b>control</b> <b>amplifier</b> output. Another source is impulse–like disturbances due to ELMs (Edge Localized Modes) and this can occasionally lead to loss of control when the <b>control</b> <b>amplifier</b> saturates. Models of the plasma open loop dynamics were obtained using the process of system identification. Experimental data is used to fit the coefficients of a mathematical model. The frequency response of the model {{is strongly dependent on}} the shape of the plasma. The effect of shielding by the vessel wall on external measurements when compared with internal measurements is also observed. The models were used to predict values of gain margins and phase crossover frequencies which were found to be in good agreement with measured values. The harsh reactor conditions on the proposed ITER tokamak preclude the use of internal measurements. On COMPASS–D the stability margins of the loop decrease when using only external flux loops. High order controllers were designed to stabilize the system using only external measurements and to reduce the effect of 600 Hz noise on the <b>control</b> <b>amplifier</b> voltage. The controllers were tested on COMPASS–D and demonstrated the improved performance of high order controllers over the simple P+D controller. ELMs cause impulse–like disturbances on the plasma position. The optimal controller minimizing the peak of the impulse response can be calculated analytically for COMPASS–D. A multiobjective controller which combines a small peak impulse response with robust stability and noise attenuation can be obtained using a numerical search.
