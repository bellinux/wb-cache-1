[...] This has been recognized at least since the early nineteenth century. [...] However, it is only recently that arable farmers have begun to consider these beetles in their crop rotations. [...] This renewed interest in the role of beetles in crop rotations is due to many factors; some of which are: the decreased value of crops and pressure from environmental groups to decrease the use of pesticides and other farming practices that are detrimental to the environment. [...] Most of the more recently adopted farming practices (e.g. selective insecticides and augmenting non-crop habitat) will affect the population of ground beetles, but not immediately.

Because many species declines have been linked to habitat fragmentation and loss, large-scale prairie restoration projects have the potential to provide critical habitat for these declining species. We examined how the structure of restored grassland habitat changes through time and how diversity and community composition of grassland birds respond to these changes. Our study was completed at Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge, a large-scale prairie restoration in central Iowa. Vegetation composition and structure were measured at 42 restored grassland plots throughout the refuge in 2007. Birds were surveyed at these locations from 1994 to 2007. Survey points were sorted into five <b>categories</b> (out <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> rotation for 1, 2, 3, 4 – 6, and 3 ̆e 6 y). In the initial phases of restoration, species such as horned larks, red-winged blackbirds, and killdeer were abundant.

The farmers use modern, labor and traditional inputs towards the production <b>of</b> two broad <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> outputs: <b>crops</b> and livestock. The first goal is to study estimation methods of agricultural input demand systems {{in the light of}} imperfect data and compare the consequences of not taking data quality into account versus when they are. These problems are addressed using techniques that include discrete choice models and virtual price methods. The second goal is to measure and examine the productivity of farmers and investigate the sources for existing variations in efficiencies. This is done using Stochastic Frontier Analysis methods and Data Envelopment Analysis. Besides the estimation of efficiency scores, investigating the effects of tenancy status and input-use on productivity are also addressed. The final goal is to link the above treatments empirically. This is done by examining the degree of misspecification that might arise from a failure to include the efficiency measures in the estimation of demand systems...|$|R

However, determining optimal nutrient requirements for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) crops at subfield scale remains a challenge given specific climatic, edaphic, and managerial conditions. Multilevel modeling can generalize yield response to fertilizer additions using data easily accessible to growers. Our objective was to elaborate a multilevel N fertilizer response model for potato crops using the Mitscherlich equation and a core data set of 93 N fertilizer trials conducted in Québec, Canada. Daily climatic data were collected at 10 × 10 km resolution. Soils were characterized by organic matter content, pH, and texture in the arable layer, and by texture and tools of pedometrics across a gleization-podzolization continuum in subsoil layers. There were five <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> preceding <b>crops</b> and five cultivar maturity orders. The three Mitscherlich parameters (Asymptote, Rate, and Environment) were most often site-specific. Sensitivity analysis showed that optimum N dosage increased with non-leguminous high-residue preceding crops, coarser soils, podzolization, drier climatic condition, and late cultivar maturity. The inferential model could guide site-specific N fertilization using an accessible minimum data set to support fertilization decisions. As decision-support system, the model could also provide a range of optimum N doses across a large spectrum of site-specific conditions including climate change...|$|R

There were six range areas involved, namely Kundasang, Randagong, Nalapak, Lohan-Bongkud, Timbua and Perancangan. The objectives of the study have been to identify the type of tree species planted, the distribution of tree plantation areas, the planting practiced, and the perception of small holders towards tree plantation activity. Data were gathered by direct observation, interviews, questionnaire, as well as secondary data, which were collected from related agencies such as the Agricultural Department and the Rubber Industrial Board in Ranau. There were 47 observations of plantation areas recorded, and the farmers involved were interviewed. The study has identified that Hevea brasiliensis and Durio zibethinus of the agriculture crops' tree were the most types planted by the small holders. Species planted under the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> other selected plantation trees were Acacia sp. (40 %), Tectona grandis (29 %), Pinus sp. (18 %), Azadirachta excels, Neolamarckia cadamba, Octomeles sumatrana and Eucalyptus sp. (13 %). The species of Acacia sp., Tectona grandis, Octomeles sumatrana and Eucalyptus sp. were found at Randagong, Lohan-Bongkud, Timbua and Perancangan while Pinus sp. was mainly found at Kundasang. Azadirachta excelsa, Neolamarckia cadamba and Octomeles sumatrana were only found at Timbua, Lohan and Nalapak. The study has also revealed that the tree plantations among the small holders in Ranau were influenced by land areas owned by the farmer, and the willingness to wait for the long term outcome of the investment. Integrated planting among trees and various crops was applied in order to maximize the usage of the available land. The tree plantation under the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> agriculture <b>crops</b> was mainly for the purpose of economic income, while other selected plantation trees were cultivated for landscaping, long term investment and also for soil protection. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{substantial}} equivalence {{has been accepted}} as {{the cornerstone of the}} health hazard assessment of genetically modified (GM foods (OECD 1993). Substantial equivalence is the most practical approach to address the safely of foods or food components derived from GM crops and is based on comparison of the phenotypic and compositional characteristics <b>of</b> the parent <b>crop</b> and the GM <b>crop.</b> Basically, three <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> GM <b>crops</b> can be considered (FAO/WHO 1996; EU 1997). (a) GM crops which have the same composition as the parent crop, (b) CM crops which have the same composition as the parent crop {{with the exception of a}} well-defined trait, and (c) GM crops which are different from the parent crop. For the safety assessment <b>of</b> the first <b>category</b> <b>of</b> GM foods only a molecular characterisation of the genetic insert is sufficient, whereas for the second category a safety assessment of the expressed protein(s) is also required. For the last category an extensive evaluation including bioavailability and wholesomeness studies are required, beside the molecular characterisation and safety assessment of the expressed protein(s) and their products. By molecular characterisation is meant the position, nature, stability and number of copies of the inserted DNA. Substantial equivalence is established by the determination of the phenotypic characteristics (e. g. resistance against diseases, agronomic properties) and the complete chemical composition of the plant including nutrients, toxicants. antinutrients, and allergens. The toxicity of the expressed protein(s) is assessed by their homology with known protein toxins, degradation in the gastro-intestinal tract, stability to food processing and acute toxicity in rodents. The possible allergenicity of the expressed proteins is evaluated by comparison of their amino acid sequence with that of known allergens and determination of their stability to digestion and food processing. if the source of the genetic insert is allergenic then the use of solid-state immunoassays, skin prick tests and even food challenge tests can be considered...|$|R

Suitable land-use maps often either do not exist or are not readily available. This article presents a novel method to compile spatial and temporal land-use data sets using multi-temporal remote sensing in combination with existing data sources. Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) -Vegetation 10 -day composite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images (1998 – 2002) at 1 km 2 resolution for a part of the Nizamabad district, Andhra Pradesh, India, were linked with available crop calendars and information about cropping patterns. The NDVI images were used to stratify the study area into map units represented by 11 distinct NDVI classes. These were then related to an existing land-cover map compiled from high resolution Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) -images (Liss-III on IRS- 1 C), reported crop areas by sub-district and practised crop calendar information. This resulted in an improved map containing baseline information on both land cover and land use. It is concluded that each defined NDVI class represents a varying but distinct mix of land-cover classes and that the existing land-cover map consists of too many detailed ‘year-specific’ features. Four groups of the NDVI classes present in agricultural areas match well with four <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> practised <b>crop</b> calendars.

It also ranked fourteenth {{out of all}} the states with respect to agricultural exports with its top exports, fruits and vegetables, falling within the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> specialty <b>crops.</b> According to the USDA (2003), Florida's agricultural exports help to boost farm prices and income and supported approximately 17, 000 jobs both on and off farm in 2001, and as such are important to Florida's agricultural and statewide economy. From a Florida farm cash receipts perspective, increased imports could undermine revenue earnings from specialty crop production, especially if there is not a comparable growth in the exports <b>of</b> these <b>crops.</b> This report covered the period 1991 to 2002 and examined trade flows for selected specialty crops deemed important to Florida's agriculture. Overall, the US had a relatively high import level of the selected specialty crops. This was apparent from the widening trade gaps and the declining surpluses experienced by all commodities, with the exception of oranges and strawberries. CANMEX was the dominant supplier of vegetables, and growing imports from this group drove the growing vegetable trade deficit. With respect to fruits, CANMEX was also a dominant supplier and affected trade balances however, many of the declining fruit trade balances were due to declining exports to markets such as Asia and the Europe. CANMEX {{played a major role in}} the trade of foliage and floriculture but did not dominate the trade. Over the period 1991 to 2002 there were changes in the trade flows of the selected vegetables, fruits and foliage and floriculture. Two noticeable trends were the concentration of trade with CANMEX, especially with respect to vegetable exports, and declining exports to Asia and Europe. Also noticeable was declining trade balances experienced by the majority of the commodities in this study. Under free trade agreements, it becomes difficult to prevent the inflow of goods.

Adaptation of agriculture to climate change could cover a wide range of measures, from changes in the farming management practices (e.g. choice <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> varieties, use <b>of</b> pesticides, change in crop calendar, rainwater harvesting) to large investment schemes in developing and/or improving the agriculture infrastructure (e.g. irrigation equipments).|$|R

More than 50 per cent of 143 m ha- 1 (net cultivated area) {{falls in the}} <b>category</b> <b>of</b> problems soils (Vyas, 2006). Sen (2003) reported that more than 90 per cent {{of the land in}} the north eastern states alone is affected by soil acidity of varying degrees which have restricted the crop choice in more than 70 per cent <b>of</b> gross <b>cropped</b> area in this region to cereals particularly the rice. The amelioration of 25 million hectares promises additional 25 million tones of food grains (Sharma and Sarkar, 2005). Besides, the fertilizer use as well its efficiency is also poor due to unfavorable pH conditions. The soil degradation due to salinity and alkalinity problems had affected significant chunk of fertile tracts. Covering an area of about 67. 27 lac hectares (Sharma et al., 2007). The emphasis should therefore be given to solve these soil problems by adopting different management strategies like addition of different amendments, choice <b>of</b> <b>crop,</b> irrigation and drainage management for increasing the production as well as productivity on sustainable basis...|$|R
40|$|The {{agricultural}} sector is a <b>category</b> <b>of</b> superior sector that potentially {{to develop the}} region economic sector. The {{agricultural sector}} is main sector for Ngawi. From the five sub-sectors <b>of</b> agriculture (<b>crops,</b> plantations, livestock, forestry, and fisheries), sub-sector <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> is the contributor largest for {{the total value of}} agricultural production, especially rice commodity. This study conducted to know the progress of agricultural sector, sub-sector of agriculture, and the spatial distribution of agriculture sub-sector which have the advantage and contributed greatly for the economic growth in Ngawi during 2004 until 2013. The method used in this research is quantitative research methods, that is processing the numeral data by using spatial approach which used to know the spatial distribution of potential the agricultural sector in Ngawi. The analyzing data used LQ (Location Quotient), analysis unit per agriculture sector and mapping the spatial distribution of analysis unit per district. The results of this study are Ngawi have superior agriculture sector such as sub-sector <b>of</b> <b>crops,</b> livestock, and forestry. The potential sub-sector <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> based on the potential land are at sub-districts of Sine, Kendal, Paron, Kedunggalar, Widodaren, and Karanganyar. The potential sub-sector of livestock are at sub-districts Sine, Kendal, Widodaren, Paron, Geneng, and Ngawi. The potential sub-sector of forestry is the second largest teak wood manufacture after Banyuwangi at East Java. The superiority of three sub-sectors are related with the physical and non-physical factors, and the factors that involved the agricultural sector in the district of Ngawi...|$|R
