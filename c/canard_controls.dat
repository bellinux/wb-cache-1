This is a deficient system with problems especially in yaw. Any kind of upset initiated by the pilot or by turbulence could impart a sideways motion that the rudder effect of the V-wing is not strong enough to counteract. The pilot must deflect the canard surface in the opposite direction before the upset pushes the nose beyond the maximum recovery angle of the canard. If this is not done, the result could be a non-controllable spiral dive.|$|E

The results indicate that canards are effective in producing pitching moment {{throughout most of the}} test angle-of-attack and Mach number range and that the variations of pitching moment with lift for trim conditions are relatively linear. There is a decrease in canard effectiveness with an increase in angle of attack up to about Mach 2. 50 as evidenced by the beginning of coalescence of the pitching-moment curves. At a Mach number above 2. 50, there is an increase in effectiveness at moderate to high angles of attack. Simulated launch straps have little effect on the lift and pitch characteristics but do cause an increase in drag, and this increase in drag induces a rolling moment at a zero roll attitude where the straps cause an asymmetric geometric shape. The canards are not suitable devices for roll control and, at some Mach numbers and roll attitudes, are not effective in producing pure yawing moments...|$|E

The tests were conducted through an angle-of-attack range of 0 deg to 30 deg and through horizontal-tail deflections of 10 deg to minus 30 deg. The complete configuration exhibited excessive positive static longitudinal stability about the design center-of-gravity location. However, the configuration was unstable laterally at low angles of attack and unstable directionally throughout the angle-of-attack range.

Various canard surfaces for pitch control only were te sted on the body with the 10 deg flare and on the body with both sets of fins. The results indicated that the addition of a flared afterbody or cruciform fins produced configurations which were longitudinally and directionally stable.

The missiles had cruciform wings and canard surfaces of delta plan form with 70 deg. swept leading edges. Five bodies having fineness ratios of 19. 1, 17. 7, 16. 7, 15. 7, and 14. 8 were investigated. The results of the investigation indicated a large nonlinear variation of pitching moment with angle of attack for the body of largest fineness ratio that was progressively reduced by decreasing the fineness ratio until it was essentially eliminated for a body of fineness ratio 14. 8. The increased linearity of the moment curve would make it possible to reduce the margin of stability so that, for a given canard size and deflection, a higher trim angle of attack might be obtained for the shortest missile than for the longest missile. The pitching-moment results indicated that methods of prediction which assumed linear variations with angle of attack for the wing-alone and wing-plus-interference characteristics were adequate for angles of attack up to about 12 deg. At higher angles of attack it was evident that the characteristics of these components were nonlinear and that more refined methods would be required for adequate prediction...|$|E

40|$|Blended {{wing-body}} (BWB) aircraft {{concept has}} its body ‘blended’ with the wing in smooth transition. Unlike conventional aircraft design, BWB aircraft’s body produces lift force and this causes large {{impact on the}} flight dynamics and stability. This thesis focuses on flight dynamics of a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with BWB configuration incorporating a set of <b>canard</b> as longitudinal <b>control</b> surface. The objective is to predict the flight dynamics and stability behaviour of UiTM’s Blended Wing-Body (BWB) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with <b>canard</b> as <b>control</b> surface, known as Baseline-II E- 2, in longitudinal mode with classical-approach stability augmentation to achieve level 1 phugoid and short-period modes flying qualities (restricted to damping ratios) as stated in MIL-F- 8785 C standard. This study proposes simple scheduled feedback gains to the canard. Wind tunnel experiments, computational simulations and empirical estimations were conducted to characterize its aerodynamics and {{to come up with}} its aerodynamic mathematical model for flight dynamics derivatives calculation. The flight dynamics model was derived to become Model-N state-space representation and compared to established models. Transient response to a unit step canard input was simulated using these models for flight conditions inside the airplane operating flight envelope (OFE) within its allowed angle of attacks. It was found that the BWB airplane without SAS, despite being statically and dynamically stable, has poor flying qualities for both short-period and phugoid modes. The change of short-period and phugoid modes’ natural frequencies and damping ratios with respect to airspeed, dynamic pressure and altitude were studied to establish mathematical relationships that were used to design a suitable scheduled gains to be fed to the <b>canard</b> <b>control</b> surface. Classical method was used to come up with feedback gains relationships with respect to dynamic pressure. By setting the required damping ratios for both modes to a demanded value couples with simplifications to these equations, the magnitude of feedback gains could be determined. The relationship between feedback gains and dynamic pressure was used to construct a representative block diagram of the complete aircraft control system with stability augmentation using <b>canard</b> <b>control</b> surface in Matlab SIMULINK. The resulting transient response were analyzed to compute values of short-period and phugoid modes’ damping ratios. The results of these damping ratios show that the aircraft with SAS has good flying qualities (Level 1) while maintaining short-period and phugoid modes’ damping ratios to around 0. 7.
