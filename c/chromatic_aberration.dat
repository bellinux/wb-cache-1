5|$|Enter the Voids {{post-production}} process lasted {{more than}} a year. Work on the digital effects was led by Pierre Buffin of BUF Compagnie. Every scene in the film includes computer-generated imagery (CGI)—even the flashback scenes, where the backdrops were digitally altered. Studio scenes, helicopter shots, and CGI were forged together in the hovering sequences with the intention that the viewer should be unable to determine which is which. For shots from high altitudes, the team started with helicopter footage from video, and then created computer models of the neighbourhoods with textures from photographs. Neon lights, reflections, and dark areas were consistently accentuated. Flickers were created through a mixture of motion blur, <b>chromatic</b> <b>aberration,</b> and focus effects. For scenes seen as through a fisheye lens, the team recreated the sets digitally and progressively increased the environments' reflection values along with the lens effect.|$|E
5|$|Cats have {{excellent}} night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision. This is partly {{the result of}} cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light. Another adaptation to dim light is the large pupils of cats' eyes. Unlike some big cats, such as tigers, domestic cats have slit pupils. These slit pupils can focus bright light without <b>chromatic</b> <b>aberration,</b> and are needed since the domestic cat's pupils are much larger, relative to their eyes, than the pupils of the big cats. At low light levels a cat's pupils will expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes. However, domestic cats have rather poor color vision and (like most nonprimate mammals) have only two types of cones, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; they have limited ability to distinguish between red and green. A 1993 paper reported a response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rods which {{might be due to}} a third type of cone. However, this appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision.|$|E
5|$|From this work, he {{concluded}} that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours (<b>chromatic</b> <b>aberration).</b> As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the objective to bypass that problem. Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique. Newton ground his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton's rings to judge {{the quality of the}} optics for his telescopes. In late 1668 he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope. It was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image. In 1671, the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes, Of Colours, which he later expanded into the work Opticks. When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions, which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation– History and De motu corporum in gyrum). But the two men remained generally on poor terms until Hooke's death.|$|E
50|$|The refracting lenses used in {{the imaging}} {{spectrometer}} limit performance by the axial <b>chromatic</b> <b>aberrations</b> of the lens. These <b>chromatic</b> <b>aberrations</b> are bad because they create differences in focus, which prevent good resolution; however, if the range is restricted {{it is possible to}} achieve good resolution. Furthermore, <b>chromatic</b> <b>aberrations</b> can be corrected by using two or more refracting materials over the full visible range. It is harder to correct <b>chromatic</b> <b>aberrations</b> over wider spectral ranges without further optical complexity.|$|R

25|$|As <b>chromatic</b> <b>aberration</b> {{is complex}} (due to its {{relationship}} to focal length, etc.) some camera manufacturers employ lens-specific <b>chromatic</b> <b>aberration</b> appearance minimization techniques. Almost every major camera manufacturer enables some form of <b>chromatic</b> <b>aberration</b> correction, both in-camera and via their proprietary software. Third party software tools such as PTLens are also capable of performing complex <b>chromatic</b> <b>aberration</b> appearance minimization with their large database of cameras and lens.|$|E
25|$|The dyes used in {{the digital}} camera sensors for {{capturing}} color are not very efficient so cross-channel color contamination is unavoidable and causes, for example, the <b>chromatic</b> <b>aberration</b> in the red channel to also be blended into the green channel along with any green <b>chromatic</b> <b>aberration.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Chromatic</b> <b>aberration</b> {{is caused}} by the {{dispersion}} of the lens material—the variation of its refractive index, n, with the wavelength of light. Since, from the formulae above, f is dependent upon n, it follows that light of different wavelengths is focused to different positions. <b>Chromatic</b> <b>aberration</b> of a lens is seen as fringes of colour around the image. It can be minimised by using an achromatic doublet (or achromat) in which two materials with differing dispersion are bonded together to form a single lens. This reduces the amount of <b>chromatic</b> <b>aberration</b> over a certain range of wavelengths, though it does not produce perfect correction. The use of achromats was an important step {{in the development of the}} optical microscope. An apochromat is a lens or lens system with even better <b>chromatic</b> <b>aberration</b> correction, combined with improved spherical aberration correction. Apochromats are much more expensive than achromats.|$|E

40|$|The {{replacement}} of bulk refractive optical elements with diffractive planar components enables the miniaturization of optical systems. However, diffractive optics suffers from large <b>chromatic</b> <b>aberrations</b> {{due to the}} dispersion of the phase accumulated by light during propagation. We show that this limitation can be overcome with an engineered wavelength-dependent phase shift imparted by a metasurface and demonstrate a design that deflects three wavelengths without dispersion. A planar lens without <b>chromatic</b> <b>aberrations</b> at three wavelengths is also presented. Our design is based on low-loss dielectric resonators which introduce a dense spectrum of optical modes to enable dispersive phase compensation. The suppression of <b>chromatic</b> <b>aberrations</b> in metasurface-based planar photonics will find applications in lightweight collimators for displays, and chromatically-corrected imaging systems...|$|R

25|$|Lenses {{suffer from}} aberrations that distort images.

50|$|Early lenses {{suffered}} from flare and low contrast, worsening {{as the number}} of lens-air interfaces increased.

When using older lenses today one should check that <b>chromatic</b> <b>aberrations</b> and flare are acceptable for the application.|$|R
25|$|Lenses do {{not form}} perfect images, and a lens always {{introduces}} {{some degree of}} distortion or aberration that makes the image an imperfect replica of the object.

25|$|In optics, <b>{{chromatic}}</b> <b>aberration</b> (abbreviated CA; {{also called}} chromatic distortion and spherochromatism) is an effect resulting from dispersion {{in which there}} is a failure of a lens to focus all colors to the same convergence point.
