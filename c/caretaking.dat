Evelyn, a {{descendant}} of John Evelyn, sold ground then being used as market gardens in Deptford, to the London County Council for less than its market value, as well as paying toward the cost of its purchase. It was officially {{opened to the public}} as Deptford Park on 7 June 1897. In 1886, he dedicated an acre and a half of the Sayes Court recreation ground in perpetuity to the public and a permanent provision was made for the Evelyn estate to cover the expense of maintenance and <b>caretaking,</b> this was opened on 20 July 1886.|$|E

25|$|An Archive of Feelings focuses {{specifically}} on lesbian and queer trauma. Cvetkovich explores works on butch and femme sexualities {{in relation to}} trauma and touch, {{as well as the}} complex relationship between incest, lesbianism, and queerness; here, she analyzes performances by Tribe 8 at the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival and works by Margaret Randall and Dorothy Allison. Another section of Cvetkovich's book discusses trauma and queer diaspora in Frances Negrón-Muntaner's film, Brincando el charco; Pratibha Parmar's film, Khush; and Shani Mootoo's novel, Cereus Blooms at Night. Furthermore, An Archive of Feelings contains substantial discussion on AIDS activism, particularly in relation to the organization ACT UP. Drawing upon oral interviews with lesbians who participated in ACT UP – as well as memoirs about <b>caretaking</b> during the AIDS crisis – Cvetkovich seeks to place lesbians back into the history of ACT UP during a time when the organization was “in danger of being remembered as a group of privileged gay white men without a strong political sensibility.” In their testimony, these interviews and memoirs form an archive of feelings, producing a lesbian public culture where affective life and political life coalesce.|$|E
500|$|By 1921 he was Supervisor of <b>Caretaking</b> (later [...] of Buildings) himself, {{and by his}} {{retirement}} in 1941 four hundred Harvard staff were under his supervision, including twenty-two [...] "yard cops".|$|E

500|$|According to The New York Times, Friends with Benefits, a film [...] "about {{love and}} {{sex in the}} age of social networking, gets some of its juice and tang partly by trash-talking its own genre. The setup is familiar, as are the {{essential}} elements: a single man and a single woman, two battered hearts yet a pair of resilient, eager, pretty bodies [...] Friends with Benefits starts from the premise that its characters, and you, are sick of the romantic comedy clichés they may secretly, or not so secretly, adore." [...] Drew Pinsky, an addiction medicine specialist felt that the film's central characters, both of whom were raised by a single parent in the film, [...] "start looking for ways to solve that problem because they were never given the opportunity to grow an emotional landscape from a nurturing, available parent. They were just quickly parentalized and became a caretaker. And the <b>caretaking</b> is all part of the 'going for a broken person' and trying to fix them." [...] He further added that [...] "love addiction ending in 'happily ever after' is not a great message." ...|$|E
2500|$|Codependency is a {{tendency}} to behave in overly passive or excessively <b>caretaking</b> ways that negatively impact one's relationships and quality of life.

2500|$|Cornelia Peake McDonald – Cornelia {{was married}} to a Winchester lawyer, Angus McDonald III, 23 years her senior, and who served as a Colonel in the Confederate Army.

Her home was {{ultimately}} used as a hospital.|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{acknowledged}} that Congress, by enacting the FMLA, had sought [...] "to protect {{the right to}} be free from gender-based discrimination in the workplace." [...] The FMLA was meant to protect that right by guaranteeing to working women, who Congress found usually bear the primary responsibility for family <b>caretaking,</b> the right to take unpaid leave to deal with this responsibility while still retaining employment. [...] Whether the FMLA was constitutional depended on whether Congress had evidence that the states were systematically violating women's workplace rights. [...] Citing Bradwell v. Illinois and Goesaert v. Cleary, the majority {{acknowledged that}} there was a long history of legally sanctioned discrimination against women in employment opportunities.|$|E
2500|$|The Beit Trust and the Anglican Diocese {{provided}} finance to pay {{maintenance and}} <b>caretaking</b> staff. Peter Bradshaw, {{who had been}} a teacher at Springvale School, became the liaison link between the remaining Board and Patrick Gosho, paying the ground staff and assisting whenever he could with maintenance and problem solving. In December 1981, the Springvale Board held a meeting to discuss the reopening of the school and the logistics involved. Proper written notice had been given to St Philip's by the Chairman of the Springvale Board before June 1981 to end the lease on December 31, 1982, but unfortunately, {{in the words of the}} then Bishop of Mashonaland, the Right Rev'd Peter Hatendi, who later assumed personal responsibility for St Philip's, [...] "the St Philip's board of governors did very little about it and they accepted a new intake in January 1982".|$|E
2500|$|The {{new school}} was called New Herrlingen, but {{generally}} known as Bunce Court. It had over 40 rooms and extensive grounds, {{making it an}} ideal location for a boarding school. From the beginning, the new school suffered from a chronic lack of funds. There was no money for a domestic or <b>caretaking</b> staff, so everyone, staff and pupils had daily chores and did the work, from converting stables into new dormitories, laying telephone cables and repairing furniture to gardening, growing vegetables and looking after the chickens to peeling potatoes, cleaning and polishing. The younger boys lived in a building, initially without electricity, about [...] away from the main building. Twenty of the oldest boys lived in a dormitory built on the grounds {{with the help of}} British Quakers. The school maintained a large vegetable garden, two greenhouses, five hundred hens, beehives and several pigs, which were fed on kitchen waste, all primarily run by pupils.|$|E
2500|$|Art therapy {{can take}} place in a variety of {{different}} settings. [...] Art therapists may vary the goals of art therapy and the way they provide art therapy, depending upon the institution's or client's needs. After an assessment of the client's strengths and needs, art therapy may be offered in either an individual or group format, according to which is better suited to the person. [...] Art therapist Dr. Ellen G. Horovitz wrote, [...] "My responsibilities vary from job to job. It is wholly different when one works as a consultant or in an agency as opposed to private practice. In private practice, it becomes more complex and far reaching. If you are the primary therapist then your responsibilities can swing from the spectrum of social work to the primary care of the patient. This includes dovetailing with physicians, judges, family members, and sometimes even community members that might be important in the <b>caretaking</b> of the individual." [...] Like other psychotherapists in private practice, some art therapists find it important to ensure, for the therapeutic relationship, that the sessions occur each week in the same space and at the same time.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, Chapman {{became a}} born again Presbyterian and {{distributed}} Biblical tracts. He met his first girlfriend, Jessica Blankenship. He began {{work as a}} YMCA summer camp counselor; he was very popular with the children, who nicknamed him [...] "Nemo". He won an award for Outstanding Counselor and was made assistant director. [...] Those who knew him in the <b>caretaking</b> professions unanimously called him an outstanding worker. A friend recommended The Catcher in the Rye to Chapman and the story eventually took on great personal significance for him, {{to the extent that}} he reportedly wished to model his life after its protagonist, Holden Caulfield. After graduating from Columbia High School, Chapman moved for a time to Chicago and played guitar in churches and Christian night spots while his friend did impersonations. He worked successfully for World Vision with Vietnamese refugees at a resettlement camp at Fort Chaffee in Arkansas, after a brief visit to Lebanon for the same work. He was named an area coordinator and a key aide to the program director, David Moore, who later said that Chapman cared deeply for the children and worked hard. Chapman accompanied Moore to meetings with government officials, and President Gerald Ford shook his hand.|$|E
60|$|There {{is nothing}} doing at {{present in the}} <b>caretaking</b> way for Mrs. Dowey, our hostess; {{but this does not}} damp her, <b>caretaking</b> being only to such as she an extra financially and a halo socially. If she had the honour of being served with an income-tax paper she would {{probably}} fill in one of the nasty little compartments with the words, 'Trade--charring; Profession (if any)--caretaking.' This home of hers (from which, to look after your house, she makes occasionally temporary departures in great style, escorting a barrow) is in one of those what-care-I streets that you discover only when you have lost your way; on discovering them, your duty is to report them to the authorities, who immediately add them to the map of London. That is why we are now reporting Friday Street. We shall call it, in the rough sketch drawn for to-morrow's press, 'Street in which the criminal resided'; and you will find Mrs. Dowey's home therein marked with a X.|$|E
60|$|This, then, {{was the end}} of it all--of the carpets, and furniture, and {{the little}} rented house; of the {{meetings}} and walking out, the thrilling nights of starshine, the deliciousness of surrender, the loving and the being loved. She was stunned by the awful facts of this Game she did not understand--the grip it laid on men's souls, its irony and faithlessness, its risks and hazards and fierce insurgences of the blood, making woman pitiful, not the be-all and end-all of man, but his toy and his pastime; to woman his mothering and <b>caretaking,</b> his moods and his moments, but to the Game his days and nights of striving, the tribute of his head and hand, his most patient toil and wildest effort, all the strain and the stress of his being--to the Game, his heart's desire.|$|E
60|$|During Roland Clewe's absence in Germany {{his works}} {{had been left}} under the general charge of Samuel Block. This old man was not a {{scientific}} person; {{he was not a}} skilled mechanic; in fact, he had been in early life a shoemaker. But when Roland Clewe, some five years before, had put up his works near the little village of Sardis, he had sent for Block, whom he had known all his life and who was at that time the tenant of a small farm, built a cottage for him and his wife, and told him {{to take care of the}} place. From planning the grounds and superintending fences, old Sammy had begun to keep an eye upon builders and mechanics; and, being a very shrewd man, he had gradually widened the sphere of his <b>caretaking,</b> until, at this time, he exercised a nominal supervision over all the buildings. He knew what was going on in each; he had a good idea, sometimes, of the scientific basis of this or that bit of machinery, and had gradually become acquainted with the workings and management of many of the instruments; and now and then he gave to his employer very good hints in regard to the means of attaining an end, more especially in the line of doing something by instrumentalities not intended for that purpose. If Sammy could take any machine which had been constructed to bore holes, and with it plug up orifices, he would consider that he had been of advantage to his kind.|$|E
6000|$|He was a widower; but in {{the months}} of July and August he ventured to cross the Alps for six weeks {{on a visit to}} his married daughter. He told me her name. It was that of a very aristocratic family. She had a castle--in Bohemia, I think. This is as near as I ever came to ascertaining his nationality. His own name, strangely enough, he never mentioned. Perhaps he thought I had seen it on the {{published}} list. Truth to say, I never looked. At any rate, he was a good European--he spoke four languages to my certain knowledge--and a man of fortune. Not of great fortune evidently and appropriately. I imagine that to be extremely rich would have appeared to him improper, outre--too blatant altogether. And obviously, too, the fortune was not of his making. The making of a fortune cannot be achieved without some roughness. It is a matter of temperament. His nature was too kindly for strife. In the course of conversation he mentioned his estate quite by the way, in reference to that painful and alarming rheumatic affection. One year, staying incautiously beyond the Alps as late as the middle of September, he had been laid up for three months in that lonely country house with no one but his valet and the <b>caretaking</b> couple to attend to him. Because, as he expressed it, he [...] "kept no establishment there." [...] He had only gone {{for a couple of days}} to confer with his land agent. He promised himself never to be so imprudent in the future. The first weeks of September would find him on the shores of his beloved gulf.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Caretaking</b> is historical, {{rooted in}} the British {{tradition}} of land maintenance. In 1868, The Times defined a caretaker as [...] "a person {{put in charge of}} a farm from which the tenant has been evicted."

The property <b>caretaking</b> field has been covered by The Caretaker Gazette since 1983.|$|E
