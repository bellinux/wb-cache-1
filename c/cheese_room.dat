50|$|In 1832, Milo Jones, a {{government}} surveyor, moved from Vermont to Fort Atkinson {{with his wife}} and two children, to establish a traditional dairy farm. This small family farm produced primarily cheese, but also raised pigs for their own consumption. In 1849, Milo C. Jones was born and soon joined his family in working the farm. At the age of 35 the younger Jones developed rheumatoid arthritis and was unable to continue working on the farm, however in 1889, with the family facing financial difficulty, he decided to begin a sausage-making enterprise in the family's <b>cheese</b> <b>room</b> using his mother's traditional family recipe that had been brought from Vermont. Milo Jr.'s sausage production technique was unique at the time: instead of pork trimmings, he made his sausage using ham, loin, and shoulder cuts.|$|E
50|$|Much of Semley's pasture {{had long}} been devoted to dairy farming, and in about 1871 one Thomas Kirby started a {{business}} close to Semley station buying milk and sending it by rail to London. Kirby expanded his business with other depots in south Wiltshire and Dorset in the 1880s. By 1889 it was trading as Semley and Gillingham Dairies, and in 1890 it became Salisbury, Semley and Gillingham Dairies. United Dairies (Wholesale) Ltd. bought the business in 1920 and added a factory at Semley by 1924. In 1928 United Dairies added milk pasteurisation and storage facilities and a cheese-making facility. In 1944 the <b>cheese</b> <b>room</b> was converted to an egg store. In 1959 United Dairies merged with Cow & Gate to form Unigate. By 1985 Unigate had closed the Semley factory and it was being divided into smaller units for industrial use.|$|E

I reached the flat, rushy, and willowy green valley of the Biss. The road forded the brook and brought me up into the sloping {{courtyard}} of Brook House Farm. On the right was a high wall {{and a pile of}} rough cordwood against it; on the left a buttressed, ecclesiastical-looking building with tiers of windows and three doorways, some four or five centuries old; and before me, {{at the top of the}} yard, between the upper end of the high wall and the ecclesiastical-looking building, was the back of the farm-house, its brass pans gleaming. This is the remnant of Brook House. What is now a cowshed below, a <b>cheese</b> <b>room</b> above, has been the chapel of Brook House, formerly the seat of Paveleys, Joneses, and Cheneys. The brook below was once called Baron's brook on account of the barony conferred on the owner: the family of Willoughby de Broke are said to have taken their name from it. The cows made an excellent congregation, free from all the disadvantages of believing or wanting to believe in the immortality of the soul, in the lower half of the old chapel; the upper floor and its shelves of Cheddar cheeses of all sizes could not offend the most jealous deity or his most jealous worshippers. The high, intricate rafter-work of the tiled roof was open, and the timber, as pale as if newly scrubbed, was free from cobwebs — in fact, chestnut wood is said to forbid cobwebs. Against the wall leaned long boards bearing the round stains of bygone cheeses. Every one who could write had carved his name on the stone. Instead of windows there were three doors in the side away from the quadrangle, as if at one time they had been entered either from a contiguous building or by a staircase from beneath. Evidently both the upper and the lower chambers were formerly subdivided into cells of some kind. [...] The farm-house is presumably the remnant of the old manor house, cool and still, looking out away from the quadrangle over a garden containing a broad, rough-hewn stone disinterred hereby, and a green field corrugated in parallelograms betokening old walls or an encampment. The field next to this is spoken of as a churchyard, but there seems to be no record of skeletons found there. Half a mile off in different directions are Cutteridge, Hawkeridge, and Storridge, but nothing nearer in that narrow, gentle valley[...] [...] [...]|$|E

The lipid oxidation (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances) of cheese was periodically tested by oxidative analyses. The results showed that all five plant extracts were effective against three foodborne pathogens in cheese. Treatments with these extracts increased the stability of cheese against lipid oxidation. Clove showed the highest antibacterial and antioxidant activity. The reduction of foodborne pathogen numbers and the inhibition of lipid oxidation in cheese indicated that the extracts of these plants (especially clove) have potential as natural food preservatives.

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} planned {{to assess the}} {{distribution}} of yeasts and moulds in different types of cheese, and to study the effect of natamycin on their survival during manufacture of Feta cheese and its storage. Materials and methods: A total of 150 samples of local manufactured cheese were collected randomly from markets of Qena city in Egypt which were subjected for mycological examination by traditional microbiological examinations. The effects of different concentrations of natamycin on survival of yeasts and moulds in Feta <b>cheese</b> at <b>room</b> temperature, refrigeration condition, and pH values were evaluated. Results: Highest yeasts and moulds contaminations were recorded in Kareish cheese with a mean value of 2. 40 x 106 +/- 9. 72 x 105 and 4. 64 x 102 +/- 1. 18 x 102, respectively. The isolated moulds were mostly Cladosporium, Penicillium and Aspergillus, while yeast genera were species of Candida and Debaryomyces hansenii. Yeasts and moulds could not be detected after 24 h, and after curd in Feta cheese samples containing natamycin (at 0. 2 % or 0. 4 %) when the cheese samples were stored either at room or refrigeration temperature. Gradual decrease of pH value was also recorded in the cheese. Conclusion: Natamycin has strong antifungal activity and can extend cheese shelf-life during storage period.

The part of cheeses was stored at 6 °C, second part at room temperature 23 °C and third part at 40 °C. Processed cheeses were produced by Madeta, a. s., sterilized at 117 °C 20 min. The analysis was made at regular intervals, cheeses stored 16 and 23 months were analysed in this work. The aroma compounds were isolated by SPME and subsequently identified and quantified by gas chromatography. In total 37 aroma compounds were identified and quantified, 7 aldehydes, 7 ketones, 6 acids, 12 alcohols and 5 esters. Total content of aroma compounds increases with higher storage temperature. The time of storage has also influence on content of aroma compounds, we may say, that content is increasing, although sharp growth was registered only after 23 months, namely in the thermostat. Simultaneously sensory analysis of cheeses was made. Ranking test and evaluation using scale were used. Cheeses from a fridge were always evaluated as the best in all categories. <b>Cheeses</b> stored at <b>room</b> temperature were evaluated worse and cheeses from thermostat were the worst.

Thirty-four peptides from 3 to 35 amino acids, including three phosphorylated peptides, constitute the β-casein hydrolysate, as shown by tandem mass spectrometry. Cell extracts prepared from Lactobacillus helveticus ITG LH 1, ITG LH 77, and CNRZ 32, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis ITG LL 14 and ITG LL 51, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CNRZ 397 and NCDO 1489, and Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ 385, CIP 102303, and TA 060 were standardized in protein. The peptidase activities were assessed with the β-casein hydrolysate as the substrate at pH 5. 5 and 24 °C (conditions of warm room ripening) by (i) free amino acid release, (ii) reverse-phase chromatography, and (iii) identification of undigested peptides by mass spectrometry. Regardless of strain, L. helveticus was the most efficient in hydrolyzing β-casein peptides. Interestingly, cell extracts of S. thermophilus were not able to release a significant level of free proline from the β-casein hydrolysate, which was consistent with the identification of numerous dipeptides containing proline. With the three {{lactic acid bacteria}} tested, the phosphorylated peptides remained undigested or weakly hydrolyzed indicating their high intrinsic resistance to peptidase activities.

Additionally, probiotic properties of lactobacilli species provide several health effect for human by stimulation of immune system and protection against pathogens. Lactobacillus rhamnosus LC 705 is a facultatively heterofermentative type lactobacilli which is used in production of dairy products as adjunct starter and protective culture. The complete and annotated genome sequence of L. rhamnosus strain LC 705 published on 2009. Known characteristics of L. rhamnosus strain LC 705 are food preservation, toxin removal and health benefits when combined with other probiotic strains. However, molecular mechanism behind these characteristics are not known or not clearly understood. To get further insight on these properties and roles in cheese ripening of strain LC 705, we re-annotated genome of the LC 705 with updated methods and databases, analyzed metabolic pathways of LC 705, and performed RNA-seq experiment to determine gene expression changes of LC 705 during warm room (25 °C) and cold <b>room</b> (5 °C) <b>cheese</b> ripening process. Several un-characterized proteins of LC 705 were annotated (77) and 1197 enzyme commission (EC) numbers are added to annotation file with re-annotation of genes of LC 705. More importantly, re-annotation provided us 72 new pathways of LC 705 which is 35 % of the entire collection of 201 pathways. Analyzes of pathways showed that genome of LC 705 has responsible genes for production of flavor compounds such as acetoin and diacetyl which are provide buttery flavor to dairy products, and hydrogen sulfide which is a volatile sulfur compound that cause unlikeable odor. Additionally to flavor compounds, we defined genes that produce anti-fungus compounds and bacteriocin which provide food preservation characteristic to LC 705. Determination of gene expression respond of LC 705 during warm room and cold <b>room</b> <b>cheese</b> ripening process with RNA-Seq showed that central metabolism genes that responsible for lyase activity, degradation activity, disaccharides and monosaccharides metabolism are warm induced genes. The genes play role in citrate metabolism pathways were significantly down-regulated during cold room, citrate degradation pathways are critical for buttery flavor products, therefore buttery flavor compounds are produced by LC 705 during warm room. Finally, during cold room ripening, the genes of LC 705 that produces ethanol and acetyl-CoA from pyruvate was up-regulated, so we may say that LC 705 uses pyruvate to produce ethanol and acetyl-CoA instead of lactic acid...|$|R
40|$|The {{similarity}} {{of the pattern}} of methyl ketones obtained from the steam distillates at atmospheric pressure of cheeses made under controlled aseptic conditions, despite the wide differences in bacterial flora, led to the suspicion that the methyl ketones were being formed as artifacts. This was confirmed by steam distilling cheeses from 1 day to 13 months old when the qualitative patterns and quantitative amounts differed little with {{the age of the}} cheese. Evidence was produced to show that the greater part of these methyl ketones must be formed during the heat treatment of milk fat. The maximum quantities of methyl ketones obtainable from cheese and from milk fat, determined by exhaustive steam distillation at atmospheric pressure, averaged from 14 p. p. m. for 2 -undecanone to 46 p. p. m. for 2 -pentadecanone. Some artifact formation of methyl ketones also occurred, although to a greatly reduced extent, when dairy products containing milk fat were steam distilled under reduced pressure at 40 °. As methyl ketones in low concentrations could be extracted from mature <b>cheese</b> at <b>room</b> temperature by solvents or by flushing cheese suspension with nitrogen, milk fat appears to contain precursors which break down to methyl ketones slowly during cheese ripening, this breakdown being accelerated at higher temperatures. Two possible modes of formation of the methyl ketones with an odd number of carbon atoms, found in limiting quantity in the steam distillates of Cheddar cheese, were considered:- (a) From precursors, probably β-keto acids, bound in milk fat. (b) The β-oxidation of free fatty acids, formed by the lipolysis of milk triglycerides, and subsequent decarboxylation of the β-keto acids formed. The use of radioactive milk fat from a lactating cow which had been injected intravenously with carboxy- 14 C acetate allowed a direct comparison to be made between the labelling patterns of fatty acids and the corresponding methyl ketones from the same milk source. The {{similarity of}} the labelling patterns suggests that the C 6 to C 16 β-keto acids and the corresponding fatty acids have a common precursor (or that one is the precursor of the other) and are together incorporated into the triglycerides. Only butyric acid of the C 4 to C 16 fatty acids in all 3 milkings had a higher specific activity than the corresponding methyl ketone. This suggests that the acetone found in steam distillates of milk fat is formed from a compound (probably D-β-hydroxybutyrate), derived almost entirely from a precursor other than acetate. The finding that the saturated C 18 acid in all 3 samples of radioactive milk fat had an extremely low activity was in agreement with the fact that no C 17 methyl ketone was detected in any of the numerous steam distillates from milk fat or cheese. This supports the generally accepted view that, in the biosynthesis of milk fat, the fatty acids up to c 16 acid are synthesised from an acetate pool, whereas C 18 acids and above are obtained from the blood triglycerides. The possibility that methyl ketones were being formed in Cheddar cheese from the β-oxidation of free fatty acids, as well as from a slow breakdown of bound β-keto acids in milk fat, was shown to be improbable. Triglycerides of acids (undecanoic, nonanoic, and heptanoic), which occur normally only in traces in milk fat, were synthesised and incorporated in Cheddar cheeses. On steam distillation of these cheeses when mature, no methyl ketones corresponding to the acids in the added triglycerides were obtained, although the normal range of methyl ketones with an odd number of carbon atoms was found in the distillates. A detailed study of the metabolism of fatty acids and synthetic triglycerides by spores and mycelium of Penicillium roqueforti was undertaken, this fungus being chosen as a general representative of lipolytic organisms that might be of importance in producing Cheddar flavour. The effect of the growth medium, pH of solution, concentration of acid and inorganic ions on both oxygen uptake and methyl ketone formation was determined. The rate of methyl ketone formation suggested the synthesis of adaptive β-keto acid decarboxylases after a lag period of 1 to 2 hours. An hypothesis based upon the possible toxicity of the C 6 to C 12 β-keto acids can explain a number of the experimental results: (1) Only one methyl ketone was formed (2) The most toxic acids were those which gave the least amount of methyl ketone (3) Concentrations of the C 8 to C 12 fatty acids that markedly inhibited the respiration of mycelium were nevertheless oxidised to considerable quantities of the corresponding methyl ketone. The relationship between the toxic action of fatty acids and chain length was found to be dependent upon pH. The chain length of the most toxic acid increased with pH, being C 10 acid at pH 2. 5 and C 12 at pH's 5. 2 and 6. 0. At pH 6. 8 none of the acids from C 4 to C 18 inhibited oxygen uptake but C 14 acid was the most toxic acid at pH 8. 0. There appeared to be no sharp dividing line between the metabolic activity, with respect to fatty acids, of spores and mycelium. Mycelium oxidised fatty acids rapidly giving varying amounts of methyl ketone but considerably more CO 2 than spores. In general spores formed higher amounts of methyl ketones than mycelium but showed also a slight but definite ability to form CO 2 from octanoic acid. Evidence for a β-oxidation mechanism in the fungal metabolism of fatty acids was obtained by the use of 1 -C 14 and 2 -C 14 octanoic acids. A relatively slow movement of intermediates through the T. C. A. cycle was also indicated. High concentrations of triglycerides were oxidised slowly by spores to methyl ketones when equivalent concentrations of the free acid (up to 66 μmoles/ml) inhibited methyl ketone formation. It seems probable that the very slow rate of formation of methyl ketones is due to the inhibitory effect of the ketones themselves on the lipases. Methyl carbinols were not detected in significant amounts as products of the metabolism of methyl ketones, evidence being obtained on the contrary that the carbinols were possibly precursors of the ketones during the oxidation of fatty acids by spores. Cell free extracts obtained from mycelium were able to oxidise low concentrations of octanoic acid (0. 5 μ-moles/ml or less) after a lag of up to 3 hours. The supplementation of the extracts with several coenzymes, known to be associated with fatty acid oxidation, or with T. C. A. cycle intermediates were unable, however, to decrease the lag before oxidation started. No methyl ketones were detected after the oxidation of fatty acids by cell-free extracts but were formed when cell debris from the Hughes Press was used. This suggests that the β-keto acid decarboxylases were tightly bound to the cell walls...|$|R
