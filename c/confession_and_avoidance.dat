50|$|<b>Confession</b> <b>and</b> <b>avoidance,</b> in pleading, {{the plea}} admitting that facts alleged in a {{declaration}} are true, but showing new facts {{by which it}} is hoped to destroy {{the effect of the}} allegations admitted. A plea in <b>confession</b> <b>and</b> <b>avoidance</b> neither simply admits nor merely denies; it admits that the facts alleged by the opposite party make out a good prima facie case or defence, but it proceeds to destroy the effect of these allegations either by showing some justification or excuse of the matter charged, or some discharge or release from it. All matter in <b>confession</b> <b>and</b> <b>avoidance</b> must be stated clearly and distinctly, and must be specific. If intended to apply to part only of a statement of claim, it must be so stated.|$|E
40|$|In {{this brief}} comment I offer some {{critical}} reflections on Professor Hogg 2 ̆ 7 s proposed approach to Charter interpretation. I suggest that Professor Hogg 2 ̆ 7 s attempt to legitimize and constrain judicial review {{is an exercise}} in <b>confession</b> <b>and</b> <b>avoidance.</b> On the one hand, he admits that 2 ̆ 2 interpretivism 2 ̆ 2 is explanatorily inadequate, yet on the other he refuses to accept 2 ̆ 2 non-interpretivism 2 ̆ 2 for he realizes that {{it has the potential to}} unmask the politics of law. I argue that Hogg 2 ̆ 7 s third way - that Charter interpretation should be progressive and purposive - is incapable of bearing the legitimizing weight which he requires in that it necessitates ahistoricism, circularity and a retreat into textual objectivism. By way of conclusion, I suggest that we must abandon the repressive machinations of textual fetishism so that we may honestly confront the nexus between law, politics and power. In turn, this will enable us to demand of powerholders - including judges - that they use their power for democratic rather than mystificatory ends...|$|E
40|$|Curtailing the Pleadings. The common-law {{system of}} {{pleading}} contemplated successive pleadings in alternation by each party until an issue was reached upon which one party assumed the affirmative {{and the other}} party the negative. This process was to be followed no matter what time was thereby consumed. Under the code system of pleading, however, the purpose {{is not so much}} to obtain a narrow issue, as to have each party 2 ̆ 7 s view of the facts on record as concisely and as quickly as possible. This difference in purpose led to a striking difference in attitude towards the reply to the answer under the two systems. At common law the replication was a necessary part of the hierarchy of pleadings whenever the plea contained matter in <b>confession</b> <b>and</b> <b>avoidance,</b> i. e., new matter. It was, however, but {{one of a series of}} pleadings and might be followed in turn by the rejoinder, the surrejoinder, the rebutter, the surrebutter and further pleadings, if necessary. The plan of the code, on the other hand, was to cut off the 1 leadings quite sharply at the reply or before. Under the original code, the plaintiff might reply to new matter; but under many modern codes the reply either is not available or is available only in a limited class of cases. The result is that the issue is more quickly arrived at under the codes, but it is presumably a broader and more general one...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: One {{expression}} of the core psychopathology of eating disorders is the repeated checking <b>and</b> <b>avoidance</b> of shape or weight. Two studies are reported. The {{primary purpose of the}} first was to describe the phenomenology of such body checking <b>and</b> <b>avoidance.</b> The aim of the second was to compare body checking <b>and</b> <b>avoidance</b> in women with and without a clinical eating disorder. METHOD: In Study 1, 64 female patients with clinical eating disorders participated in a semistructured interview assessing the features of body checking <b>and</b> <b>avoidance.</b> In the second study, a self-report questionnaire was used to compare body checking <b>and</b> <b>avoidance</b> in women with and without a clinical eating disorder (n = 110). RESULTS: The majority (92 %) of the patients in Study 1 checked their bodies to assess their shape or weight and this was associated significantly with eating disorder symptoms. In Study 2, the clinical group had significantly more body checking <b>and</b> <b>avoidance</b> than the comparison group, and there was a strong association between eating disorder psychopathology and body checking <b>and</b> <b>avoidance.</b> CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the view that body checking <b>and</b> <b>avoidance</b> are direct expressions of the overevaluation of shape and weight. Further work is needed to determine whether these expressions contribute to the maintenance of eating disorders...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{investigated}} short-term re-experiencing <b>and</b> <b>avoidance</b> after elective surgical abortion. In addition, it was prospectively investigated whether peritraumatic dissociation and pre-abortion dissociative tendencies and alexithymia predict re-experiencing <b>and</b> <b>avoidance.</b> Method: In a prospective observational design, Dutch-speaking women presenting for fi rst trimester elective surgical abortion completed self-report measures for dissociative tendency and alexithymia. Peritraumatic dissociation was measured immediately post-abortion. Re-experiencing <b>and</b> <b>avoidance</b> were measured 2 months post-abortion. Results: Participants reported moderately {{elevated levels of}} reexperiencing <b>and</b> <b>avoidance</b> that exceeded a clinical cut-off point for 19. 4 % of the participants. Peritraumatic dissociation predicted intrusion <b>and</b> <b>avoidance</b> at 2 months. In addition, avoidance was predicted by the alexithymic aspect of diffi culty describing feelings. Conclusions: Reexperiencing <b>and</b> <b>avoidance</b> after elective surgical abortion represent a signifi cant clinical problem that is predicted by peritraumatic dissociation and alexithymia. Psychological screening and intervention might be a useful adjunct to elective abortion procedures...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to compare the {{theology}} of Dietrich Bonhoeffer <b>and</b> the belief, <b>confession</b> <b>and</b> faith of the Swedish church in order to see similarity. The research questions that have been used are: 1 : What is the main feature of Dietrich Bonhoeffers theology? 2. What are the main feature the belief, <b>confession</b> <b>and</b> faith of the Swedish church? 3 : Which are the similarities between the main feature of Dietrich Bonhoeffers theology and the main feature of Swedish church belief, <b>confession</b> <b>and</b> faith? The research method that has been used is comparative where the Dietrich Bonhoeffers theology is compared whit the Swedish church belief, <b>confession</b> <b>and</b> faith. This model has been the foundation model in this comparison. In conclusion, this study of comparing the theology of Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Swedish church belief, <b>confession</b> <b>and</b> faith in order to see similarity has shown that there are similarities. The study showed that there are several similarities but in three of them the similarities appear more clearly and that is in the thoughts about community, The Bible and Jesus Christ...|$|R

2500|$|Before the assembly, Arminius finally {{explained}} his call {{to rewrite the}} Belgic <b>Confession</b> <b>and</b> the Heidelberg Catechism, saying {{that he did not}} feel obligated to explain his position before, for [...] "as a professor, he considered himself subject only to the authority of the Leiden Curators and the States, not to the Church". Arminius then gave an overview of all the various opinions existing on predestination. He claimed that supralapsarianism was contrary to the <b>Confession</b> <b>and</b> Catechism and that [...] "supra- and infralapsarianism, basically amount to the same thing." [...] Arminius put forward his own view on predestination which he held was in concordance with the <b>Confession</b> <b>and</b> the Catechism.|$|R

40|$|Three studies {{investigated}} {{the association of}} social approach <b>and</b> <b>avoidance</b> motivation with cognition, behavior, emotions, and subjective well-being. Study 1 (N = 245), a correlative self-report study, showed that approach <b>and</b> <b>avoidance</b> motivation mediated the effects of adult attachment-styles on social anxiety. A secure attachment-style was associated with co-occurring approach <b>and</b> <b>avoidance</b> motivation. Study 2, a social-interaction study (N = 38), revealed an association of avoidance motivation with a negative experience and passive behavior, and approach motivation with a positive experience and active behavior. Interestingly, the interaction of approach <b>and</b> <b>avoidance</b> motivation predicted engaged behavior and a positive emotional experience. Study 3 (N = 203), an online survey, showed that subjective well-being was negatively associated with high avoidance motivation, irrespective {{of the strength of}} approach motivation. Taken together, the studies show that social approach <b>and</b> <b>avoidance</b> motivation interact in predicting positive experiences and social behavior in a concrete social situation. However, from the long-term perspective, the negative consequences of social avoidance motivation seem to prevail when approach <b>and</b> <b>avoidance</b> motivation co-occur...|$|R
