For example, attenuators, <b>cables,</b> <b>splitters</b> and combiners are all reciprocal networks and [...] in each case, or the S-parameter matrix will be equal to its transpose.

5000|$|... ==Cable quality== The same VGA cable can be {{used with}} a variety of {{supported}} VGA resolutions, ranging from 640×350px @70 Hz (24 MHz of signal bandwidth) to 1280×1024px (SXGA) @85 Hz (160 MHz) and up to 2048×1536px (QXGA) @85 Hz (388 MHz). There are no standards defining the quality required for each resolution but higher-quality cables typically contain coaxial wiring and insulation that make them thicker. Shorter VGA cables are less likely to introduce significant signal degradation. A good-quality cable should not suffer from signal crosstalk, whereby signals in one wire induce unwanted currents in adjacent wires, or ghosting. Ghosting occurs when impedance mismatches cause signals to be reflected. However, ghosting with long cables may be caused by equipment with incorrect signal termination or by passive <b>cable</b> <b>splitters</b> rather than the cables themselves.|$|R

Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) {{are expected to be}} one of the next generation of wireless interconnection technologies, providing flexible high bandwidth wireless backhaul over large geographical areas. While single radio mesh nodes operating on a single channel suffer from capacity constraints, equipping mesh routers with multiple radios using multiple non-overlapping channels can significantly alleviate the capacity problem and increase the aggregate bandwidth available to the network. However, it is well known that multi-radio Mesh platforms face many limitations such as interference, radiation leakage, crosstalk and limited computing resource etc. A misperception among researchers is that the so called “crosstalk” is one of the limiting factors to the performance decrease in multi-radio Mesh networks, but through a series of experiments the results shows otherwise. In this paper, we present a unique experimental approach that utilizes antenna <b>cables,</b> <b>splitters,</b> couplers and attenuators etc. to create a controlled wireless environment, and results indicates, despite negligible effect, crosstalk is not a limiting factor, but rather the finite computing resource constrains the aggregated performance of multi-radio Mesh networks, and several other factors have been investigated as well...|$|R

50|$|In {{a shared}} system, a receive antenna is usually {{located at the}} top of the antenna tower. Putting the receive antenna at the top helps to capture weaker {{received}} signals than if the receive antenna were lower of the two. By splitting the received signal from the antenna, many receivers can work satisfactorily from a single antenna. Devices called receiver multicouplers split the signal from the antenna into many receiver connections. The multicoupler amplifies the signals reaching the antenna, then feeds them to several receivers, attempting to make up for losses in the power dividers (or splitters). These operate similarly to a <b>cable</b> TV <b>splitter</b> but must be built to higher quality standards so they work in environments where strong interfering signals are present.|$|R

30|$|In {{practical}} data acquisition, it is {{very likely}} that pseudorange errors at particular epochs suddenly have significantly larger values than the expected ones. This might be due to the presence of diffraction and multipath or to the variations of the instrumental delays possibly due to temperature variations which can occur at different sections: antenna, <b>cables,</b> amplifiers, <b>splitters,</b> receivers, such as anomaly inside the GNSS receivers (Parkinson and Spilker 1996; Defraigne and Bruyninx 2007). Without loss of generality, all these kinds of errors can be categorized as Sudden Increase of Pseudorange Errors (SIPE). Some ground-based experiments showed that the multipath on pseudorange can even exceed a magnitude of 6.0  m (Liu et al. 2009). Similar to cycle slips in carrier phase data, the pseudorange can have anomalous range errors unexpectedly anytime. For instance, an SIPE of 8.6  m was identified in the cycle slip analysis, resulting in erroneous cycle slip fix outcome (Liu 2011). New algorithms should be developed to address the cycle slip detection and fix issue under challenging situations when SIPE is present.|$|R

A full duplex radio simultaneouslytransmits and receives at that same time and on the same frequency thus doublingthe throughput of the existing systems. One of the fundamental challenges in enablingfull duplex is the cancellation of the self-interference that is caused by device’s owntransmitter. Considering the high level of the self-interference at the receiver front end,it is necessary to cancel out the interference in the analog domain to avoid the ADCsaturation.

40|$|The last decades, we have {{witnessed}} different phenomenology in the telecommunications sector. One {{of them is the}} widespread use of the Internet, which has brought a sharp increase in traffic, forcing suppliers to continuously expand the capacity of networks. In the near future, Internet will be composed of long-range highspeed optical networks; a number of wireless networks at the edge; and, in between, several access technologies. Today one of the main problems of the Internet is the bottleneck in the access segment. To address this issue the Passive Optical Networks (PONs) are very likely to succeed, due to their simplicity, low-cost, and increased bandwidth. A PON is made up of fiber optic <b>cabling</b> and passive <b>splitters</b> and couplers that distribute an optical signal to connectors that terminate each fiber segment. Among the different PON technologies, the Ethernet-PON (EPON) is a great alternative to satisfy operator and user needs, due to its cost, flexibility and interoperability with other technologies. One of the most interesting challenges in such technologies relates to the scheduling and allocation of resources in the upstream (shared) channel, i. e., the resource management. The aim of this thesis is to study and evaluate current contributions and propose new efficient solutions to address the resource management issues mainly in EPON. Key issues in this context are future end-user needs, quality of service (QoS) support, energy-saving and optimized service provisioning for real-time and elastic flows.

According to network topology distinguished point to point and point to multipoint network. Networks points to point are also known as an active optical network and for each user are restricted to a separate fiber. Point to multipoint networks known as passive optical network. In terms of the PON is defined by many standards. For a selected location will be choice the most appropriate solution. Finally, the measurement will be made and will be considered for monitoring the route. Before the design of optical access networks, I made an illustrative simulation in program OptSim. Performed simulations helps to study the transmission characters of optical networks, depending on the physical architecture. In general, for the design of high-capabilities networks for large companies will be more appropriate active topology that provides due wavelength multiplexes high transmission capacity. To join in the urban areas with a large number of separate houses, it is more appropriate use of passive topology. For the design of optical networks has been selected location with multiple housing buildings. The end customer is not given the requirement for high data transfer rates as large companies. For the proposal was selected FTTB networks which is suitable because of lower costs. The second variant of the proposal was a passive optical network according to standard GPON. This standard was chosen because of the high splitting ratio. For both solutions was developed the entire proposal by ITU-T with a detailed drawing documentation. In the selected area was conducted measuring the optical networks in order to verify the possibility of extension actual solutions.
