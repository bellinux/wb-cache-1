Typical articles include matters of horticultural interest, field reports, literature reviews, and plant descriptions. The journal was established in early 1984, a year after the society itself was founded. Early in its history, issues were grouped into volumes; this system was later abandoned in favour of <b>continuous</b> <b>issue</b> numbering. The journal totals around 80 pages annually.|$|E

From volume 7 in 2004 the magazine began printing in full colour on glossy A5 paper, and was renamed to AIPC Magazine. The magazine was released in annual volumes until 2006, when it adopted <b>continuous</b> <b>issue</b> numbering starting with a new issue 1 (March 2006).

40|$|Abstract—Tourism {{researchers}} have recently focused on repeat visitation {{as a part}} of destination loyalty. Different models have also considered satisfaction as the main determinant of revisit intention, while findings in many studies show it as a <b>continuous</b> <b>issue.</b> This conceptual paper attempts at evaluating recent empirical studies on satisfaction and revisit intention. Based on limitations and gaps in recent studies, the current paper suggests a new model that would be more comprehensive than those in previous studies. The new model offers new relationships between antecedents (destination image, perceived value, specific novelty seeking, and distance to destination) and both of satisfaction and revisit intention. Revisit intention in turn is suggested to be measured in a temporal approach. Keywords—Satisfaction, revisit intention, a new model I...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper derives {{the optimal}} {{replenishment}} lot size and shipment policy for an Economic Production Quantity (EPQ) model with multiple deliveries and rework of random defective items. The classic EPQ model assumes a <b>continuous</b> inventory <b>issuing</b> policy for satisfying demand and perfect quality for all items produced. However, {{in a real}} life vendor–buyer integrated system, multi-shipment policy is practically used in lieu of <b>continuous</b> <b>issuing</b> policy and generation of defective items is inevitable. It is assumed that the imperfect quality items fall into two groups: the scrap and the rework-able items. Failure in repair exists, hence additional scrap items generated. The finished items can only be delivered to customers if the whole lot is quality assured {{at the end of}} rework. Mathematical modeling is used in this study and the long-run average production–inventory-delivery cost function is derived. Convexity of the cost function is proved by using the Hessian matrix equations. The closed-form optimal replenishment lot size and optimal number of shipments that minimize the long-run average costs for such an EPQ model are derived. Special case is examined, and a numerical example is provided to show its practical usage...|$|R

40|$|At {{the present}} time we are exposed to {{continuous}} increases {{in the cost of}} a barrel of crude oil; in fact, recently the prices have reached highs that were never thought possible. However, the truth is that these price increases have been a <b>continuous</b> <b>issue</b> over the last 10 years. The demands for petroleum to use in energy generation and the synthesis of thousands of chemicals used to manufacture goods have led governments to direct their research efforts towards green chemistry and the search for alternative energy sources. One of these alternative energy sources are biofuels.

40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} suggests that in practice {{it is difficult to}} reach Pareto optimal agreements in negotiations. In this paper, we take a constructive approach to this question in two-party negotiations over <b>continuous</b> <b>issues.</b> A new negotiation procedure is presented that results in Pareto optimal agreements under fairly general assumptions. The procedure uses a mediator who assists the decision makers (DM's) by choosing jointly beneficial compromises. The procedure has the appealing feature that the DM's are only required to answer relatively simple questions and their individual utility functions need not be identified completely. Moreover, the DM's reveal minimal private information to the mediator. These are properties that we would hope to have in practical procedures to be incorporated in operational negotiation support systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a decentralized method for computing Pareto-optimal solutions in multiparty negotiations over <b>continuous</b> <b>issues.</b> The method {{is based on}} the well known weighting method which is decomposed by introducing an own decision variable for each decision maker and by applying the dual decomposition method to the resulting problem. The method offers a systematic way for generating some or all Pareto-optimal solutions so that decision makers do not have to know each others' value functions. Under the assumption of quasilinear value function the requirement that a decision maker knows the explicit form for his value function can be relaxed. In that case the decision maker is asked to solve a series of multiobjective programming problems where an additional articial decision variable is introduced...|$|R

This work adapts the previous related work to coordinate multi-bilateral concurrent negotiations taking into consideration the different behaviors of the opponents during negotiation to decide on choosing the appropriate negotiation strategy (i. e., trade-off or concession) for the buyer agent's delegates at each negotiation round. A negotiation meta-strategy to coordinate the one-to-many negotiation form is proposed and empirically tested under various negotiation environments.

40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE RESEARCH PAPER OF Tecora Duckett, for the Master of Public Administration {{degree in}} Political Science, {{presented}} on *November 8 th, 2012, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: THE POLITICS BEHIND METROPOLITAN FRAGMENTATION MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Stephanie Pink Metropolitan fragmentation {{has been a}} <b>continuous</b> <b>issue</b> for unincorporated suburban areas. Citizens in suburban areas generally {{do not want to}} be annexed into urban territory due to the threat that their community will change (Kuethe, 2012, p. 16). They fear that they will have to pay additional taxes, or that their neighborhoods will lose housing value. Although suburban areas {{do not want to be}} incorporated in the city, the urban community finds annexation necessary. There are several political concerns that surround this issue. While public service costs continue to rise in the city, majority of its wealthy contributor’s flee to suburban communities to escape the wrath of high taxes found in the city (Bockstael, 2007, p. 20672). In order to sustain economic growth, public administrators have to find alternate solutions to hinder the economic downturn they currently face (Grassmueck, 2010, p. 641). This paper will examine the economic, political, and social concerns that arise through the usage of land in areas that are incorporated into urban areas...|$|E

Furthermore, the enormous spectrum of online communication has not been taken into account. This study investigates whether specific dynamics of attention on issues and sub-topics {{can be found in}} different online public arenas. We expect to identify differences across various arenas {{as a result of their}} specific stakeholders and constellations of stakeholders, as well as different trigger events. To examine these assumptions, we shed light on the online climate change discourse in Germany by undertaking a quantitative content analysis via manual and automated coding methods of journalistic articles and their reader comments, scientific expert blogs, discussion forums and social media at the time of the release of the 5 th IPCC report and COP 19, both in 2013 (n = 14. 582). Our results show online public arena-specific dynamics of issue attention and sub-topics. In journalistic media, we find more <b>continuous</b> <b>issue</b> attention, compared to a public arena where everyone can communicate. Furthermore, we find event-specific dynamics of issue attention and sub-topics: COP 19 received intensive and continuous attention and triggered more variation in the sub-topics than the release of the IPCC report...|$|E
