Since 1985, the aquarium has been deeply involved in jellyfish propagation, creating three temporary exhibitions and one permanent aquarium gallery within the Open Sea wing.

For the aquarium's temporary exhibition that opened in 2014, the aquarium cultured many <b>cephalopods</b> because of their short life cycles. A display in the exhibition showcased how aquarists rear different species of <b>cephalopods,</b> including the bigfin reef squid. In partnership with Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, at least two deep-sea cephalopod species have been displayed in the exhibition, including flapjack octopuses and the vampire squid.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids and {{the common}} octopus (Octopus vulgaris) were studied to resolve a century-long debate over whether <b>cephalopods</b> can hear.

It showed that bigfin reef squids and octopuses utilise their statocysts for detecting vibrations, an organ primarily used for maintaining spatial orientation. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz. Bigfin reef squids have a slightly better hearing range of 400Hz to 1500Hz. Both hear best at a frequency of 600Hz. Relatively, their hearing is comparable to prawns and some other invertebrates but is less sensitive than that of most fishes.|$|E

It includes short biographies of eight female <b>cephalopod</b> researchers who are now deceased: Jeanne Villepreux-Power, Anne Massy, Grace Watkinson, Grace Pickford, Anna Bidder, Zulma Castellanos, Katharina Mangold and Martina Roeleveld. In addition, biographies are provided for six female <b>cephalopod</b> researchers who are now retired but who have made an enormous contribution to <b>cephalopod</b> knowledge during their lifetimes: Nancy Voss, Marion Nixon, Joyce Wells, Julia Filippova, Eve Boucaud-Camou, and Renata Boucher-Rodoni.

5|$|For {{many years}} only one fossil Nectocaris was known, poorly {{preserved}} {{and without a}} counterpart. This fossil was a puzzle, as its head looked rather like that of an arthropod but its body, with {{what seemed to be}} fins along its back and belly, looked rather like of a chordate's. In 2010 Smith and Caron described another 91 specimens, some very good, and reconstructed it as a cephalopod, and the earliest one as of 2010. Unlike later <b>cephalopods</b> it had only two arms, and its eyes seem mounted on stalks. But it had a soft funnel, similar to the ones used for propulsion by modern <b>cephalopods.</b>|$|E

Twenty-eight participants representing nine countries (Austria, Australia, China, Denmark, France, Italy, Japan, Spain and the USA) met {{to address the}} pressing need for genome sequencing of <b>cephalopod</b> mollusks. This group, drawn from <b>cephalopod</b> biologists, neuroscientists, developmental and evolutionary biologists, materials scientists, bioinformaticians and researchers active in sequencing, assembling and annotating genomes, agreed {{on a set of}} <b>cephalopod</b> species of particular importance for initial sequencing and developed strategies and an organization (CephSeq Consortium) to promote this sequencing.

50|$|Hamulina is an extinct ammonoid <b>cephalopod</b> genus {{belonging}} to the family Hamulinidae. These <b>cephalopod</b> were fast-moving nektonic carnivores. They lived during the Cretaceous period, Barremiarrean age. Type species is Hamulina astieriana.|$|R

5|$|Many animals, {{including}} moths, butterflies, mantises, phasmids, and <b>cephalopods</b> such as octopuses, {{make use}} of patterns of threatening or startling behaviour, such as suddenly displaying conspicuous eyespots, so as to scare off or momentarily distract a predator, thus giving the prey animal an opportunity to escape.|$|E
5|$|The Australian blacktip shark {{is known}} to form large groups, {{segregated}} by size and sex. It preys mainly on teleost fishes, including ponyfishes, grunters, tunas, and herring. <b>Cephalopods</b> are a secondary food source, which are particularly important around April. This species also occasionally consumes smaller sharks, including snaggletooth sharks (Hemipristis pristis), spottail sharks (C. sorrah), and sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon). Their diets shift with age: smaller individuals feed on proportionately more bottom-dwelling fish, while larger individuals feed on proportionately more midwater fish and <b>cephalopods.</b> Documented parasites of this shark include the tapeworms Fossobothrium perplexum and Platybothrium sp., and the copepod Perissopus dentatus.|$|E
50|$|So {{important}} is his {{influence on the}} resurgence of <b>cephalopod</b> systematic research, hardly a paper has been published in <b>cephalopod</b> systematics and zoogeography, and even otheraspects of <b>cephalopod</b> biology and fisheries, that doesn't cite at least one paper published by Voss. This {{has been the case}} for nearly 4 decades and it will continue to be so for many decades into the 21st Century.|$|R
50|$|The parasites undergo merogony and gametogony in the {{digestive}} tract and sometimes in the other tissues of the <b>cephalopod.</b> The oocysts may be passed in the stool or form within the tissues of the <b>cephalopod.</b> When the oocysts are ingested by a crustacean - frequently a crab - they decyst and infect {{the digestive}} tract of the crustacean. The life cycle is completed when the crustacean is eaten by a <b>cephalopod.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In biology, a {{pseudomorph}} is a {{cloud of}} mucus-rich ink released by many species of <b>cephalopod.</b> The name refers to the similarity in appearance between the <b>cephalopod</b> that released it and the cloud itself, in this context meaning literally [...] "false body." [...] This behaviour often allows the <b>cephalopod</b> to escape from predation unharmed, and is often performed as {{part of what is}} known as the Blanch-Ink-Jet Maneuver.|$|R
5|$|The creek whaler feeds {{predominantly}} {{on small}} teleost fishes (including threadfin breams and lizardfishes) and crustaceans (including penaeid prawns and mantis shrimps); <b>cephalopods</b> are also infrequently consumed. Known parasites {{of this species}} include the tapeworm Callitetrarhynchus gracilis, and a nematode in the genus Pulchrascaris.|$|E
5|$|The {{nursehound}} {{feeds on}} a variety of benthic organisms, including bony fishes such as mackerel, deepwater cardinalfishes, dragonets, gurnards, flatfishes, and herring, and smaller sharks such as the small-spotted catshark. It also consumes crustaceans, in particular crabs but also hermit crabs and large shrimp, and <b>cephalopods.</b> Given the opportunity, this shark will scavenge. Adults consume relatively more bony fish and <b>cephalopods,</b> and fewer crustaceans, than juveniles. Known parasites of this species include the monogeneans Hexabothrium appendiculatum and Leptocotyle major, the tapeworm Acanthobothrium coronatum, the trypanosome Trypanosoma scyllii, the isopod Ceratothoa oxyrrhynchaena, and the copepod Lernaeopoda galei. The netted dog whelk (Nassarius reticulatus) preys on the nursehound's eggs by piercing the case and extracting the yolk.|$|E
5|$|The whiskery shark is {{an active}} and highly {{specialized}} predator, feeding almost exclusively on octopuses. Other <b>cephalopods,</b> bony fishes, small rock lobsters, spoon worms, and seagrass have also been found amongst its stomach contents.

50|$|The <b>cephalopod</b> retina {{does not}} {{originate}} as {{an outgrowth of}} the brain, as the vertebrate one does. It is arguable that this difference shows that vertebrate and <b>cephalopod</b> eyes are not homologous but have evolved separately.|$|R

5000|$|Nautilus is {{the only}} genus of <b>cephalopod</b> that has a {{well-developed}} external shell. Females of the <b>cephalopod</b> genus Argonauta create a papery egg case which sometimes washes up on tropical beaches and {{is referred to as}} a [...] "paper nautilus".|$|R
5000|$|However, many <b>cephalopod</b> predators (for {{instance}} moray eels) {{have advanced}} chemosensory systems, and some anecdotal {{evidence suggests that}} compounds (such as tyrosinase) found in <b>cephalopod</b> ink can irritate, numb or even deactivate such apparatus. Unfortunately, few controlled experiments have been conducted to substantiate this. <b>Cephalopod</b> ink is nonetheless generally thought to be more sophisticated than a simple [...] "smoke screen"; the ink {{of a number of}} squid and cuttlefish has been shown to function as a conspecific chemical alarm.|$|R
