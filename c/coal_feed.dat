40|$|Since {{the thermal}} Power Plants in the Kyushu Districts {{are obliged to}} use low quality coal for fuel, they have no {{alternative}} but to utilize combustion of pulverized coal. The Unit System Tube Mill is a low costing Pulveruzer, but this system has its difficulties with automatic <b>coal</b> <b>feeding.</b> The reason being that as the feed control is carried out by interlinking the draft of the exhauster which blows the pulverized coal into the furnace with the feed rate of the coal feeder, after operation over a long period，excessive quantities of coal accumulates within the mill causing Mill- over or shortage of pulverized coal comes about decreasing the load of the Power Plant. With such difficulties constantly happening, perfect automatic combustion cannot be obtained. These defects can be corrected by disconnecting the interlink between the coal feeder and the exhauster, and controlling the feed rate of the coal feeder so that a fixed quantity of coal is constantly retained within the Tube Mill. Since a detector is necessary to determine the quantity of coal retained in the Tube Mill, the Author has invented and developed an Electro-acoustic Mill Level Meter which is quick responding and enables the operator to accurately detect the quantity of coal retained within the Mill. Recently the Unit System Tube Mill <b>coal</b> <b>feeding</b> system of the No. 2 Minato Power Plant of the Kyushu Power Company was completely switched to automatic operation by the use of this invention. Following this, the same automatic <b>coal</b> <b>feeding</b> system was installed at the Ainoura Power Plant which brought about excellent operating results.

40|$|Highveld parent coal {{was crushed}} into three size fractions, namely: 5 mm– 75 mm, 5 mm– 53 mm, and 5 – 37. 5 mm. The crushed samples were {{subjected}} as <b>feed</b> <b>coals</b> to heating in a packed-bed reactor {{to investigate the}} influence of particle size reduction on char formation and reactivity. Coal petrography was utilized to assess the maceral and char formation distribution of the <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> samples and their packed-bed combustion unit’s products. The maceral distribution of the <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> fractions differed from the typical run-of-mine Highveld coal petrographic composition; the smallest size fractions (53 mm and 37. 5 mm) having the highest vitrinite content. Maceral distribution was further divided into total reactive maceral particles, total inert maceral particles, and total inertinite particles. The 53 mm and 37. 5 mm <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> samples had the highest total reactive maceral particle content. Inert char particles dominated in the packed-bed combustion unit samples due to high inertinite maceral group content of the Highveld coals. Unexpectedly, the 53 mm <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> sample had higher content of total reactive maceral particles and lower content of total inert maceral particles; whereas the 37. 5 mm <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> sample had high content of reactive maceral particles and high content of total inert maceral particles. This variation in maceral group content lead to the 53 mm <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> sample being more reactive (producing more devolatilized and porous chars and thus reacting faster with reactant gases) than the 37. 5 mm <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> sample. This was due to inert maceral particles restricting the 37. 5 mm <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> sample from fully softening and reacting with reactant gas. This was also this was attributed to variation in volatile propagation of the three particle sizes. This confirms that a <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> with smaller particle sizes results in different reactivity, char formation, and better heat transfer during combustion than the <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> with large particle size range. Another important factor that {{plays a role in}} combustion is maceral association; it was observed that maceral distribution has a great influence on the char formation and its reactivity more than coal particle size.

40|$|During this quarter, {{agglomeration}} {{tests were}} conducted in a laboratory-scale fluidized bed combustor using coal and {open_quotes}model{close_quotes} components which allowed controlled amounts of clays and pyrites to be added during the test. These tests permitted a more direct evaluation {{of the interaction between}} iron compounds and aluminosilicates.
