40|$|A {{recombinant}} plasmid, pDH 3, {{was obtained}} from the genomic library of Serattia marcescens KCTC 2172, and several recombinant subclones constructed from pDH 3. The nucleotide sequence of a 5, 137 bp segment, pPH 4, was determined and three open reading frames were detected. The three ORFs encoded the phosphate specific transport (pst) operon, which was pstC, pstA, and pstB, with the same direction of transcription. Comparison of the pst operon of S. marcescens with that of other organisms revealed that the genes for pstS and phoU were missing. A potential <b>CRP</b> <b>bonding</b> <b>site</b> and pho box sequence was found in the upstream of the putative promoter at the regulatory region. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence showed that homology in amino acid sequences between the PstC protein and Yersinia sp., Vibrio sp., and Pseudomonas sp. were 49, 37 and 33 %, respectively. The PstA protein and Yersinia sp., Vibrio sp., and Pseudomonas sp. showed homologies of 64, 51, and 47 %, respectively. PstB protein and Methanocaldococcus sp., E. coli, and Mycoplasma sp. showed homologies of 60, 50, and 48 %, respectively. The pst genes could be expressed in vivo and positively regulated by cAMP-CRP. The E. coli strain harboring plasmid pPH 7, with pst genes, increased with the transport of phosphate...|$|E

The pharmacophore model for these receptors ligands is qualitative and defines the relative positions of important groups. It is defined with following five main features: an aromatic group (usually the indole), protonated amine (a donor of hydrogen bond), acceptor of hydrogen bond, additional hydrogen <b>bond</b> <b>site</b> (both donor and acceptor) and hydrophobic region located between both hydrogen <b>bond</b> <b>sites,</b> see figure 2.

40|$|Synthesis of high {{molar mass}} {{polycarbonate}} polyurethanes using a novel polyol is described. The resulting elastomers demonstrate excellent mechanical properties {{as well as}} the capability to re-heal after rupture without the addition of additives or imbedded healing agents. The self-healing functionality is shown to greatly improve with the addition of up to 1 % single and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The interface of the carbon nanotubes and self-healing polymer are probed using Raman techniques and provide an insight into how the self-healing actions are improved with the addition of carbon nanotubes. Synthesis of polycarbonate polyurethanes and carbon nanotube composites using a novel casting method is described and compared to the more traditional solution casting method. The dispersion of the carbon nanotubes is evaluated {{as well as the}} effect of effective dispersion on the composites through tensile testing, rheometry and hardness testing. Although complete agglomeration avoidance could not be achieved, significant size decrease was observed. Over 200 % improvement in tensile strength is shown with conventional solution casting method which is further improved by the described novel solution casting method. Contact angle measurements on our novel self-healing poly (carbonate urethane) and CNTs composites show that surface energies are drastically changed when CNTs are used. The most revealing finding is that f×svp increases in CNT composite materials from ~ 30 % of the surface energy on average for the samples tested, to ~ 80 %. We have shown that surface free energies increase most likely as a result of exposing hydrogen <b>bonding</b> <b>sites</b> typically found within the bulk in polyurethanes. Our polyurethane differs from traditional polyurethanes in that it has both novel soft segments made from a novel polycarbonate polyol discussed in chapter 2 and relatively soft ¡§hard¡¦ segments resulting from the use of H 12 MDI, all leading to increased ability to hydrogen bond within the material. The availability of the hydrogen <b>bonding</b> <b>sites</b> is demonstrated by FTIR absorbance bands for associated and unassociated hydrogen <b>bonding</b> <b>sites,</b> which {{do not seem to be}} accessible to a large until the PCPU¡¦s surface is disrupted. Once disrupted, the exposed hydrogen <b>bonding</b> <b>sites</b> are able to bond with other <b>bonding</b> <b>sites</b> of adjacent ruptured surfaces. This would explain why our material is non-blocking, e. g. won¡¦t stick to itself, until the surface is ruptured. It would also explain why any two ruptured surfaces of our material will reheal, even if they were not attached previously...|$|R
