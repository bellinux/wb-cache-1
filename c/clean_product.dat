40|$|ABSTRACT: Tar {{formation}} {{is one of}} the major problems to deal with during biomass gasification. To overcome with this problem a nickel-enriched catalytic bed material has been developed and was tested in a 100 kWth dual fluidized bed biomass steam gasifier. Different mixtures of olivine and catalyst (Ni-olivine) were used at different gasification temperatures (from 750 °C to 900 °C) and steam-to-fuel ratios (from 0. 3 to 0. 9). Gas composition and tar contents were analyzed using standardized methods. Water conversion rates, gas yields, and lower heating values were determined from mass and energy balances. The catalyst showed high activity in steam reforming of methane and tars and showed no noticeable deactivation during all experiments. The use of such an in-bed catalyst could be sufficient to produce a <b>clean</b> <b>product</b> gas and eliminating the need of downstream tar removal techniques...|$|E

40|$|A simple {{protocol}} for the efficient preparation of β-mercapto carbonyl derivatives as antimycobacterial drugs {{has been achieved}} via Thia-Michael reaction between chalcones derivatives and thiols {{in the presence of}} calcium pyrophosphate as a heterogeneous catalyst under mild reaction conditions. The central composite design was used to design an experimental program to provide data to model the effects of various factors on reaction yield (Y). The variables chosen were catalyst weight X 1, reaction time X 2, and solvent volume X 3. The mathematical relationship of reaction yield on the three significant independent variables can be approximated by a nonlinear polynomial model. Predicted values were found to be in good agreement with experimental values. The optimum reaction conditions for reaction model (chalcone and thiophenol) obtained by response surface were applied to other substrates.

40|$|Consuming {{a product}} does not (necessarily) reveal the {{environmental}} damage of the good. In terms of environmental damage, most goods are credence goods. Therefore, through advertising and pricing the firm {{will not be}} able to transmit this information to the consumers. I examine the scope for an environmental group (EG) to signal this information to consumers via advertising and campaigning. Both the short-run (where environmental damage is given but unknown to the consumers) and the long-run (where environmental damage is chosen by the firm, but not observed by the consumers) are considered. In the short-run, Pareto-improving advertising is impossible and social welfare improving advertising is only possible if the difference between a <b>clean</b> <b>product</b> and a dirty product is sufficiently large. However, in the long-run, the presence of an EG seems to have a positive effect on social welfare.

30|$|In {{addition}} to the HDS unit, a distillation system is required to obtain clean cuts. However, the order of these two sections is a problem. Based on a technical recommendation study report given by HQCEC, the hydrogenation plus fractionation process to treat naphtha can produce <b>clean</b> <b>product</b> with high quality and low impurity content compared with the fractionation plus hydrogenation units. Moreover, the energy consumption of these two plants was approximately equal. In terms of investment, the system capacity of hydrogenation plus fractionation process is slightly {{higher than that of}} the fractionation plus hydrogenation processes [11]. However, in these studies, costs and problems caused by sour petroleum cuts have been ignored. Gas condensate of South Pars field is currently sent to refineries to produce fuel cuts or sold in markets. In both cases, gas condensate with high sulfur content or sour petroleum cuts can seriously damage pipelines and process equipment due to corrosion and push up the cost of process. In the present study, it has been assumed that the primary design of sulfur removal unit for gas condensate should be based on the UDHDS plant plus a fractional distillation unit.|$|E
