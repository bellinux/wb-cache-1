50|$|The famous {{speckled}} hen scenario {{has been}} invoked by acquaintance skeptics who {{insist that the}} theory cannot explain why acquaintance with very simple mental states, like an viewing a few dots against a solid background color {{can be said to}} justify belief, while it is believed that viewing a significantly larger number of dots cannot justify belief. They believe that defenders of acquaintance theory should answer as to why the capacity of direct acquaintance should be so limited. Sellars resolves the problem simply by asserting that naturally the speckled hen experiment fails to support an acquaintance relation because the individual cannot reasonably be expected to build up such an association where the total number of objects in an array cannot be known without methodically accounting for them all. He points out that the “character of the experience” is not distinguishable to the individual’s subconscious in such cases of instant presentations of <b>complex</b> <b>arrays</b> of data.|$|E
50|$|The {{invention}} of the electronic organ in the mid-1930s spelled {{the end of the}} harmonium's success in the West (although its popularity as a household instrument declined in the 1920s as musical tastes changed). The Hammond organ could imitate the tonal quality and range of a pipe organ whilst retaining the compact dimensions and cost-effectiveness of the harmonium as well as reducing maintenance needs and allowing a greater number of stops and other features. By this time, harmoniums had reached high levels of mechanical complexity, not only through the need to provide instruments with a greater tonal range, but also due to patent laws (especially in North America). It was common for manufacturers to patent the action mechanism used on their instruments, thus requiring any new manufacturer to develop their own version; as the number of manufacturers grew, this led to some instruments having hugely <b>complex</b> <b>arrays</b> of levers, cranks, rods and shafts, which made replacement with an electronic instrument even more attractive.|$|E

5000|$|Stegosaurians were armored dinosaurs (thyreophorans). Originally, {{they did}} not differ much from more {{primitive}} members of that group, being small, low-slung, running animals protected by armored scutes. An early evolutionary innovation was the development of tail spikes, or [...] "thagomizers", as defensive weapons. Later species, belonging to a subgroup called the Stegosauridae, became larger, and developed long hindlimbs that no longer allowed them to run. This increased the importance of active defence by the thagomizer, which could ward off even large predators because the tail was in a higher position, pointing horizontally to the rear from the broad pelvis. Stegosaurids had <b>complex</b> <b>arrays</b> of spikes and plates running along their backs, hips and tails. Their necks became longer and their small heads became narrow, able to selectively bite off {{the best parts of}} cycads with their beaks. When these plant types declined in diversity, so did the stegosaurians, which became extinct {{during the first half of}} the Cretaceous period.|$|E
50|$|Laterolog tools send an {{electric}} current from an electrode on the sonde {{directly into the}} formation. The return electrodes are located either on surface or on the sonde itself. <b>Complex</b> <b>arrays</b> of electrodes on the sonde (guard electrodes) focus the current into the formation and prevent current lines from fanning out or flowing directly to the return electrode through the borehole fluid. Most tools vary the voltage at the main electrode {{in order to maintain}} a constant current intensity. This voltage is therefore proportional to the resistivity of the formation. Because current must flow from the sonde to the formation, these tools only work with conductive borehole fluid. Actually, since the resistivity of the mud is measured in series with the resistivity of the formation, laterolog tools give best results when mud resistivity is low with respect to formation resistivity, i.e., in salty mud. Induction logs use {{an electric}} coil in the sonde to generate an alternating current loop in the formation by induction. This is the same physical principle as is used in electric transformers. The alternating current loop, in turn, induces a current in a receiving coil located elsewhere on the sonde. The amount of current in the receiving coil is proportional to the intensity of current loop, hence to the conductivity (reciprocal of resistivity) of the formation. Multiple transmitting and receiving coils are used to focus formation current loops both radially (depth of investigation) and axially (vertical resolution). Until the late 80’s, the workhorse of induction logging has been the 6FF40 sonde which is made up of six coils with a nominal spacing of 40 in. Since the 90’s all major logging companies use so-called array induction tools. These comprise a single transmitting coil and a large number of receiving coils. Radial and axial focusing is performed by software rather than by the physical layout of coils. Since the formation current flows in circular loops around the logging tool, mud resistivity is measured in parallel with formation resistivity. Induction tools therefore give best results when mud resistivity is high with respect to formation resistivity, i.e., fresh mud or non-conductive fluid. In oil-base mud, which is non conductive, induction logging is the only option available.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} a new compiler optimization called with-loop-folding. It {{is based on}} a special loop construct, the withloop, which in the functional language Sac (for Single Assignment C) serves as a versatile vehicle to describe array operations on an elementwise basis. A general mechanism for combining two of these with-loops into a single loop construct is presented. This mechanism constitutes a powerful tool when it comes to generate efficiently executable code from high-level array specifications. By means of a few examples it is shown that even <b>complex</b> nestings of <b>array</b> operations similar to those available in Apl can be transformed into single loop operations which are similar to hand-optimized with-loop specifications. As a consequence, the way a <b>complex</b> <b>array</b> operation is combined from primitive array operations does not affect the runtime performance of the compiled code, i. e., the programmer is liberated from the burden to take performance considerations into account when specifying <b>complex</b> <b>array</b> operations. ...|$|R
