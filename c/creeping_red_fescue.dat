40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Chewings fescue [Festuca rubra L. subsp. fallax (Thuill.) Nyman] is {{a desired}} turfgrass with dense sod forming {{capabilities}} and superior shade tolerance. Thermal residue management (open-field burning) {{has traditionally been}} used to remove post-harvest residue and maintain seed yield {{over the life of}} the stand. However, alternative non-thermal residue management practices have been observed to produce adequate seed yields dependent upon cultivar. Strong <b>creeping</b> <b>red</b> <b>fescue</b> (F. rubra L. subsp. rubra) is desired for its prolific tillering capacity and creeping rhizomatous growth habit. In contrast to Chewings fescue, maintenance of seed yield in strong <b>creeping</b> <b>red</b> <b>fescue</b> has only been profitably produced under thermal residue management. Slender <b>creeping</b> <b>red</b> <b>fescue</b> [F. rubra L. var. littoralis (Vasey) ] is a desired turfgrass with a compact, less rhizomatous growth habit, similar to Chewings fescue in desirable turf attributes. However, little is known about the effects of post-harvest residue management in slender <b>creeping</b> <b>red</b> <b>fescue.</b> The objectives of this study were: 1) to evaluate seed yield and yield components among different cultivars to thermal (open-burning), and non-thermal (flail low and flail high) post-harvest residue management; 2) to evaluate harvest index and percent cleanout to thermal and non-thermal residue management in different cultivars; and 3) and to provide an economic analysis of thermal and non-thermal residue management in all cultivars based on partial budgeting. Three post-harvest residue management treatments (burn, flail low and flail high) were applied over the course of two years. Seed yield components measured included: total dry weight, fertile tiller number, spikelets per panicle, florets per spikelet, and panicle length. Final seed yield in each cultivar and residue management treatment method was determined after seed harvest and conditioning. Seed yield component analysis was conducted over three production seasons. Chewings fescue, strong <b>creeping</b> <b>red</b> <b>fescue,</b> and slender <b>creeping</b> <b>red</b> <b>fescue</b> cultivars responded differently to residue management as indicated by a residue management by cultivar interaction. In 2003 and 2004, residue management by cultivar interactions were evident in seed number, seed weight, fertile tiller number, percent cleanout, harvest index, and seed yield. Residue management by cultivar interactions occurred in spikelets per panicle in 2003, whereas in 2004 a residue management by cultivar interaction occurred in panicle length and florets per spikelet. In 2004, non-thermal flail low, and thermal residue management resulted in significantly greater spikelets per panicle in all cultivars. Thermal residue management resulted in the greatest number of spikelets per panicle. Results indicate that thermal residue management best maintained seed yield in most subspecies and cultivars across both years. However, in 2003, non-thermal flail low residue management produced profitable seed yield in only Marker slender <b>creeping</b> <b>red</b> <b>fescue.</b> In contrast, thermal residue management resulted in poor seed yields in Marker slender <b>creeping</b> <b>red</b> <b>fescue</b> and enhanced yields in Seabreeze slender <b>creeping</b> <b>red</b> <b>fescue</b> in 2003. However, following the second year of thermal treatment in 2004, Marker and Seabreeze both had lower seed yields, thus exhibiting the only negative impact of thermal management among the cultivars tested in this study. Moreover, upon review of an economic analysis, Marker slender red fescue was the only cultivar that produced a positive net return of 78 and 4 ha⁻¹ under non-thermal residue management in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Furthermore, in 2003, thermal residue management net return increases ranged from 104 ha⁻¹ to - 996 ha⁻¹ in Barnica and Shademark, respectively. In 2004, thermal residue management net return increases ranged from 115 ha⁻¹ and 1, 332 ha⁻¹ in Seabreeze and Shademark, respectively. Poor seed yields were observed in all strong <b>creeping</b> <b>red</b> <b>fescue</b> cultivars under non-thermal residue management across both years of the study. This may be attributed to an observed reduction in fertile tiller number and seed yield. In addition, percent seed cleanout was increased with non-thermal residue management. In 2004, as stand age increased, thermal residue management resulted in greater seed yields in all cultivars and species, except both cultivars of slender <b>creeping</b> <b>red</b> <b>fescue.</b> Thus, this study provided substantial evidence that thermal residue management has the potential to maintain or increase fine fescue seed yield as stands age as well as to maintain stand profitability...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Legislation {{to reduce}} open field burning in grass seed fields within the Willamette valley of western Oregon changed {{established}} production practices. In the creeping grasses such as Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) and <b>creeping</b> <b>red</b> <b>fescue</b> (Festuca rubra L.) non-thermal management resulted in reduced yield. Studies {{were conducted to}} examine the effects of three stubble height treatments in comparison to open field burning in <b>creeping</b> <b>red</b> <b>fescue</b> seed production. The effects of light quality on characteristics of plant development were investigated in field and controlled environments. Exogenous applications of plant growth regulators (PGR's) were made to elucidate the causes of low seed yields observed without burning. Field plots were prepared in fall of 1994, and 1995 in <b>creeping</b> <b>red</b> <b>fescue</b> commercial production fields as well as at Hyslop research farm in 1995. Three cultivars were included in the trial; Shademaster and Hector, which produce many rhizomes, and Seabreeze which produces few rhizomes. The effects of stubble height, PGRs, and field burning were measured during fall regrowth and flowering. Non-structural carbohydrates available for early regrowth were reduced when stubble was removed below 5. 0 cm, particularly in first-year stands. Fall tiller height was increased by stubble remaining and was negatively correlated with flowering. Rhizome development was reduced when stubble was removed mechanically or burned to the crown, whereas yield potential was increased. Fall ethylene application reduced fall tiller height, fall tiller number, and percent fertile tillers the following spring and was similar to control treatment compared with burn. Other PGRs did not produce consistent results in this study. Excess ethylene produced by decaying stubble may impact floral induction and reduce yield potential in <b>creeping</b> <b>red</b> <b>fescue</b> seed crops. Light quality as measured by red:far-red ratio (R:FR) was reduced by canopy closure during regrowth but not by the presence of stubble. In controlled environment studies, red light (R) promoted taller tillers, greater stage of development, and greater tiller number than far-red (FR) light. Sunlight enriched with FR completely inhibited rhizome formation. Results suggest that environments with excess reflected FR may negatively impact early development of <b>creeping</b> <b>red</b> <b>fescue</b> seed crops...|$|E

The test included a broad representation of turf species for overseeding {{in an effort to}} (1) determine selected specie/cultivar susceptibility and disease expression to rapid blight in the field and (2) survey and assess the association of laboratory isolate detection from field sampling, with disease occurrence and severity of expression of field maintained overseed turf. Over a two year period, Rapid blight, caused by Labyrinthula terrestris was capable of infesting most cool season grasses in this test. In year one, Dawson CRF, SRX 555 slender <b>creeping</b> <b>red</b> <b>fescue,</b> and SR 105210 slender <b>creeping</b> <b>red</b> <b>fescue</b> showed no positive lab detection results from field plots.

In year two, essentially all turf plots showed some symptomology of disease expression. This was confirmed by lab identification. Tiller infection rates varied from 2 % to 80 % infection in the lab from field samples. The relationship between tiller infection rates and field plot disease expression was determined by Pearson’s product and Spearman Rank correlation coefficients.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{for this}} study was that phenanthrene degrading bacterial inoculants, in combination with grass species able to tolerate petroleum hydrocarbon contamination, will result in increased degradation, as compared to natural rates of hydrocarbon degradation, or to rates of degradation attributed to bacteria or plants alone. Three experiments were performed to examine this hypothesis: i) assessment of the effect of phenanthrene degrading bacteria (Sphingomonas yanoikuyae, Rahnella aquatilis, and Arthrobacter globiformis) on seed germination, location of attachment on seeds and roots, and inoculant survival on selected grass species, ii) determination of the inoculant survival in contaminated soil in the absence of plants and the ability to degrade target compounds, and iii) degradation potential and survival of selected grass species and bacterial inoculants in soil. In general, all applied inoculants were able to effectively colonize the seeds and had a neutral or positive effect on seed germination and seedling growth. Possible plant and bacteria pairs were chosen based on positive influence of the inoculant and are as follows: perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) or <b>creeping</b> <b>red</b> <b>fescue</b> (Festuca rubra) with A. globiformis or S. yanoikuyae, or slender wheatgrass (Elymus trachycaulus) with A. globiformis or R. aquatilis. Soil-based assessment of the survival and degradation of hydrocarbons by the selected inoculants was examined with or without a manure nutrient amendment. The addition of the inoculants had a positive impact on the efficacy of hydrocarbon removal in the soil. The manure-amended soil, or A. globiformis inoculated non-amended soil treatments reduced total petroleum hydrocarbon concentration by ~ 45 %, whereas the non-amended control only resulted in a ~ 20 % reduction. When soils were amended with manure and inoculated with any of the phenanthrene degrading bacteria, contaminant concentration decreased in soil by ~ 33 %. Sphingomonas yanoikuyae survived the longest in soil in the absence of plants. A growth chamber experiment was conducted to determine the efficacy of plant and bacteria pairs for hydrocarbon removal in recalcitrant contamination found in soil from Bruderheim, Alberta. Additional replicates containing this soil were spiked with hexadecane, phenanthrene, and pyrene so the effectiveness of the plant and bacteria pairs at higher levels of fresh contamination could be assessed. In the spiked treatment, inoculation with S. yanoikuyae increased <b>creeping</b> <b>red</b> <b>fescue</b> root biomass. In the non-spiked treatment, S. yanoikuyae application increased <b>creeping</b> <b>red</b> <b>fescue</b> root and shoot biomass. Perennial ryegrass root and shoot biomass did not increase when inoculated with S. yanoikuyae, although root biomass values were observably higher in non-spiked soils. <b>Creeping</b> <b>red</b> <b>fescue</b> inoculated with S. yanoikuyae resulted in the greatest decrease in hydrocarbon concentration as compared to other treatments (~ 61 %). The perennial ryegrass treatment, when inoculated with S. yanoikuyae increased percent hydrocarbon removal (~ 10 %) above that obtained with perennial ryegrass alone. The addition of plants and S. yanoikuyae increased hydrocarbon degradation relative to control soils, although the addition of vegetation alone had a comparable effect. A critical benefit of inoculation was the increase in <b>creeping</b> <b>red</b> <b>fescue</b> root biomass at higher concentrations of contamination. This is important because the larger the root biomass the larger the volume of soil that can be remediated. The results indicate that the use of specific plant-bacterial inoculants can enhance remediation of hydrocarbon contaminated soils...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 The {{effects of}} post-harvest burning of <b>red</b> <b>fescue</b> on {{production}} of shoots, roots and inflorescences {{as well as}} seed yield were determined at the clonal and community level by comparing fescue plants in a burned area with those in unburned plots within the same field. Studies were also conducted to determine what environmental factors {{are involved in the}} seed yield increase of <b>red</b> <b>fescue</b> subsequent to burning. Open post-harvest burning of straw and stubble of <b>red</b> <b>fescue</b> was beneficial in maintaining high seed yield. An increase in tiller population coupled with vigorous root growth during the fall and winter and a greater number of inflorescences produced the following spring were the most significant differences observed in the burned area. Seed yield increases in burned plots were a direct result of increased panicles per unit area. Complete removal of residue either by hand or mechanical means also resulted in seed yield comparable to that from burning. Complete removal of residue either by burning or mechanical methods also increased early season tiller development. Apparently more of these tillers were florally induced than tillers produced on non-residue removed plots.
