40|$|This paper {{describes}} the ‘push–pull’ or ‘stimulo-deterrent diversionary’ strategy {{in relation to}} current and potential examples from our own experiences. The push–pull effect is established by exploiting semiochemicals to repel insect pests from the crop (‘push’) and to attract them into trap crops (‘pull’). The systems exemplified here {{have been developed for}} subsistence farming in Africa and delivery of the semiochemicals is entirely by <b>companion</b> <b>cropping,</b> i. e. intercropping for the push and trap cropping for the pull. The main target was a series of lepidopterous pests attacking maize and other cereals. Although the area given to the cereal crop itself is reduced under the push–pull system, higher yields are produced per unit area. An important spin-off from the project is that the <b>companion</b> <b>crops</b> are valuable forage for farm animals. Leguminous intercrops also provide advantages with regard to plant nutrition and some of the trap crops help with water retention and in reducing land erosion. A major benefit is that certain intercrop plants provide dramatic control of the African witchweed (striga).

To investigate the mechanisms, the root exudates were collected from tomato and potato onion which were grown together or separately, and were {{used to examine the}} antifungal activities against V. dahliae in vitro, respectively. Furthermore, RNA-seq was used to examine the expression pattern of genes related to disease resistance in tomato companied with potato onion compared to that in tomato grown alone, under the condition of infection with V. dahliae. The results showed that <b>companion</b> <b>cropping</b> with potato onion could alleviate the incidence and severity of tomato Verticillium wilt. The further studies revealed that the root exudates from tomato companied with potato onion significantly inhibited the mycelia growth and spore germination of V. dahliae.

RNA-seq data analysis showed the disease defense genes associated with pathogenesis-related proteins, biosynthesis of lignin, hormone metabolism and signal transduction were expressed much higher in the tomato companied with potato onion than those in the tomato grown alone, which indicated that these defense genes play important roles in tomato against V. dahliae infection, and meant that the disease resistance of tomato against V. dahliae was enhanced in the companion copping with potato onion.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 In {{conventional}} {{cropping systems}} in the Willamette Valley, slow establishing grass species, such as Kentucky bluegrass (Poapratensis L.) are planted {{in the spring and}} seed is not harvested until the following year. Due to increasing annual production costs, it is necessary to generate a cash return from each field each production year. This can be achieved by establishing the grass seed crop with a cereal <b>companion</b> <b>crop</b> either in fall or spring. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify the suitability of establishing grass seed crops with cereal companion crops in the Willamette Valley. To realize this objective, combinations of <b>companion</b> <b>crop</b> species, seeding rates, planting arrangements and grass species were examined for suitability in a companion cropping system. In addition, competitive effects of the <b>companion</b> <b>crop</b> on undersown grasses were studied. Three field experiments were conducted at two locations in the Willamette Valley over a two-year period (1980 - 1982). Percent light transmittance was measured in <b>companion</b> <b>crop</b> canopies developed under different seeding rates (67. 2 and 100. 8 kg/ha) and planting arrangements (parallel with and across grass rows) and in different types of companion crops (winter wheat, spring wheat and spring barley). Soil water potential was determined to investigate moisture patterns due to crop competition. Tiller samples were taken from undersown grasses and from these samples the following growth parameters were determined: tiller number, tiller height, leaf weight and leaf area per tiller, Specific Leaf Weight (SLW), and Leaf Area Index (LAI). <b>Companion</b> <b>crop</b> and grass seed yields were determined to obtain information for the economic feasibility of the companion cropping system. Parallel planting of the grass and companion crops gave higher light transmittance values than cross planting. However, no beneficial effects on grass crop growth parameters were detected. <b>Companion</b> <b>crop</b> seeding rates did not result in different percent light transmittance values, or was there an effect on growth parameters of undersown Kentucky bluegrass and orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.). Soil water potential was higher in Kentucky bluegrass plots established with a <b>companion</b> <b>crop</b> at Gervais than in plots established without a <b>companion</b> <b>crop.</b> Tiller number for Kentucky bluegrass was suppressed by the <b>companion</b> <b>crop</b> for the experiment in Gervais. Tiller number and LAI for Kentucky bluegrass and orchardgrass was lower when established with a <b>companion</b> <b>crop</b> in the fall of 1981 at Hyslop Farm. Tiller height, leaf weight and leaf area per tiller of Kentucky bluegrass was higher when established with a wheat <b>companion</b> <b>crop</b> at Gervais. Leaf weight per tiller and SLW of orchardgrass were suppressed by the wheat <b>companion</b> <b>crop</b> at Hyslop Farm. Differential effects on growth parameters due to different companion crops were not detected.

40|$|Introduction Saffron as {{a winter}} active plant with low water {{requirement}} {{is the most}} strategic medicinal plant in arid and semi-arid parts of Iran. This slow-growing plant has narrow leaves and no aerial stem, hence weeds can be overcome it. Moreover, because of its root and canopy structure {{an important part of}} different resources is not used by this low input crop. Therefore, the use of associated crops could be an effective way for increasing resources use efficiencies (Koocheki et al., 2016). Appropriate corm planting date is another important factor that affects saffron growth and yield. Results of some studies show that late spring is the best time for corm planting (Ghasemi-Rooshnavand, 2009; Koocheki et al., 2016). In addition, irrigation management has been evaluated in some studies, but irrigation immediately after corm planting has not been investigated previously. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of irrigation management, planting date and the use of some <b>companion</b> <b>crops</b> on flowering of saffron during two growth cycles. Materials and methods This experiment was carried out as a split-split plot experiment based on a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications at Research Station, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran in 2009 - 2011. Experimental factors included: planting date of saffron as main factor (first of June, first of August and first of October, 2009), the irrigation management as sub factor (irrigation and no irrigation after each planting date) and the <b>companion</b> <b>crops</b> as sub-sub factor [Persian clover (Trifolium resupinatum), Bitter vetch (Lathyrus sativus) and control).

40|$|Five field {{experiments}} {{located at}} four sites across south-eastern Australia found cereal grain yields were {{less in the}} presence of lucerne (<b>companion</b> <b>cropping)</b> than in the absence of lucerne (cereal monoculture). Top-dressed nitrogen (N) and in-crop lucerne suppression, generally did not enhance cereal crop yields {{in the presence of}} lucerne compared with cereals growing in monoculture. Grain yield reductions from cereals growing with lucerne were found at four of the five sites, with reductions ranging from 16 to 26 % compared with cereals growing in monoculture. In regard to cereal production, there was no main treatment by top-dressed N interaction at all sites, indicating that applying N to cereals irrespective of whether they were growing with or without lucerne, resulted in the same yield responses. With favourable growing seasons (decile > 6) and low available soil N levels, top-dressing N resulted in a 31 % and a 0. 8 unit increase in grain yield and grain protein, respectively, across all cereal crops and years. However, the absence of a grain yield response to top-dressed N at one site was due to excessive cereal biomass production from N application, causing extensive crop lodging in 2003, and decile 2 growing season rainfall in 2004. At another site, high available soil N levels and low growing season rainfall (decile 3) resulted in a 12 % decline in grain yield across all cereal crops and years in response to top-dressing N. We therefore conclude that N application to cereals growing with lucerne can increase cereal grain yields, but only when accompanied by favourable growing season rainfall and low available soil N levels. In-crop lucerne suppression was effective at reducing cereal grain contamination by lucerne pods and flowers in <b>companion</b> <b>crops,</b> but was less effective under dry seasonal conditions, demonstrating that soil moisture will affect herbicide efficacy and the effectiveness of this practice.

Over the 3 -year study, cereals sown into established lucerne (4 years of age at the commencement of the experiment) yielded 17 % less (P < 0. 05) grain than the cereal monoculture. <b>Companion</b> <b>cropping</b> also resulted in a 71 % reduction (P < 0. 05) in lucerne biomass over the growing season compared with the lucerne monoculture, but a 3 -fold (P < 0. 05) increase in total (cereal and lucerne) biomass production. There were no differences between wheat and barley crops in the presence of lucerne, although extensive lodging in the 2003 -barley monoculture did result in a significant main treatment (+/ 0 lucerne and +/ 0 in-crop lucerne suppression) × crop type (wheat and barley) interaction in grain yield, but not cereal biomass. N top-dressed after tillering onto cereal–lucerne <b>companion</b> <b>crops</b> did not increase grain yield, although it did increase cereal biomass in 2003.

However, this practice reduced (P < 0. 05) lucerne populations, and therefore potentially threatens the longer term viability of lucerne stands so more research is recommended to develop less detrimental strategies for achieving effective in-crop lucerne suppression. This study combined with results from others, suggests that rainfall was a major factor determining cereal responses in the presence of lucerne, and although there were responses in cereal biomass to additional N and herbicide suppression, these strategies appear to only have potential under favourable growing-season conditions.

40|$|Integrating {{perennial}} plants like lucerne into farming systems {{has been widely}} recommended to mimic pre-agricultural native vegetation, to improve year round transpiration and reduce the off-site impacts of agriculture on the surrounding environment. Despite {{perennial plants}} providing greater hydrological benefits compared to traditional annual plant based farming systems; integration of lucerne into farming systems remains a challenge. One approach that may enhance the integration is <b>companion</b> <b>cropping,</b> where annual crops are sown directly into an existing lucerne stand. However, past {{research has shown that}} this practice can be harmful to the productivity of annual crops, due to competition with lucerne for environmental resources. Yet beyond quantifying the effect on annual crop production, little is understood about what causes the loss of yield. Under-standing the underlying mechanisms dictating the performance of annual crops growing with lucerne could help design agronomic strategies that mitigate competition, and improve annual crop productivity; in turn potentially improving industry acceptance and adoption of both lucerne and <b>companion</b> <b>cropping.</b> In this study, two field experiments showed that competition was apparent early in the growing season prior to cereal stem elongation; when cereal biomass in the presence of lucerne was significantly lower than that of cereal grown in monoculture. Although there were no differences in cereal establishment, companion cereals produced significantly (P< 0. 05) less tillers, spikes, cereal biomass, and consequently grain yield compared with cereals grown in monoculture. Both field experiments showed that fertiliser N could potentially increase companion cereal productivity, and that in-crop lucerne suppression could improve cereal grain quality by reducing lucerne pod contamination. Apart from quantifying the temporal effects of competition between the companion cereal and lucerne and assessing the role of agronomic strategies for mitigating competition, field experiments did not give much insight into what was causing the loss of companion cereal productivity. Simulation modelling using APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) explored competition between the companion cereal and lucerne, and each component’s response to resource supply and agronomic intervention over longer periods. APSIM was found to satisfactorily simulate both simultaneous and stand alone wheat and lucerne growth, after comparison with field observed data. Although APSIM tended to deplete soil mineral N more rapidly under lucerne than field observations indicated, necessitating soil mineral N to be constrained within previously measured values in long-term simulations. Simulations showed that companion cereals were frequently sown into drier soil profiles, due to soil water extraction by lucerne over the preceding summer/autumn period, compared with monoculture cereals sown after the summer/autumn fallow. Competition for soil water appeared the major contributing factor to companion cereal performance, and simulated data predicted that companion cereals had to rely solely on in-crop rainfall. Therefore <b>companion</b> <b>cropping</b> in low rainfall environments where growing season rainfall (April to October) is less than 350 mm, or in environments where crops rely heavily on stored soil water at sowing for subsequent production, would be unsuitable for reliable grain production from <b>companion</b> <b>cropping.</b> Thesis (Ph.

Plant secondary metabolism can be harnessed for this purpose by new breeding technologies, genetic modification and <b>companion</b> <b>cropping,</b> the latter already on-farm in sub-Saharan Africa. Secondary metabolites offer the prospect of pest management as robust as that provided by current pesticides, for which many lead compounds were, or are currently deployed as, natural products. Evidence of success and promise is given for pest management in industrial and developing agriculture.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} optimal stand length of {{irrigated}} alfalfa hay. A dynamic decision model is solved which determines the optimal decision (grain or continuation {{of an existing}} alfalfa stand) for 275 possible states of the system (25 price states for each of 11 land use states). The problem is solved for specified production practices and interest rates. The decision criterion is to maximize the net present value of future returns from irrigated crops in Montana river valleys. Both pure stands and <b>companion</b> <b>crop</b> stands of alfalfa are examined. Alfalfa replacement is found to take place between seven and eight years of stand life. The decision rule is relatively insensitive to interest rates and nearly identical for both the pure and <b>companion</b> <b>crop</b> stands. A pure stand of alfalfa {{is found to be}} slightly more profitable than an alfalfa stand seeded with a <b>companion</b> <b>crop.</b> STATEMENT OF PERMISSION TO COPY In presenting this thesis in partial fulfillment of the require ments for an advanced degree. at Montana State University, I agree that the Library shall make ' it freely available for inspection.
