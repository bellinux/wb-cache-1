In cases where the 1/f noise is the main problem, one would like to select the maximum <b>chopping</b> <b>frequency</b> possible.

50|$|In {{pulse-width}} modulation the switches {{are turned}} on {{at a constant}} <b>chopping</b> <b>frequency.</b> The total time period of one cycle of output waveform is constant. The average output voltage is directly proportional to the ON time of chopper. The ratio of ON time to total time is defined as duty cycle. It can be varied between 0 and 1 or between 0 and 100%. Pulse-width modulation (PWM), or pulse-duration modulation (PDM), is a technique used to encode a message into a pulsing signal. Although this modulation technique {{can be used to}} encode information for transmission, its main use is to allow the control of the power supplied to electrical devices, especially to inertial loads such as motors. The average value of voltage (and current) fed to the load is controlled by turning the switch between supply and load on and off at a fast rate. The longer the switch is on compared to the off periods, the higher the total power supplied to the load. The PWM switching frequency has to be much higher than what would affect the load (the device that uses the power), {{which is to say that}} the resultant waveform perceived by the load must be as smooth as possible. Typically switching has to be done several times a minute in an electric stove, 120 Hz in a lamp dimmer, from few kilohertz (kHz) to tens of kHz for a motor drive and well into the tens or hundreds of kHz in audio amplifiers and computer power supplies.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedComputer based tools {{were developed to}} search water wave data for a collective mode predicted by wave turbulence theory. A low frequency wave, the "swell", can drive the collective mode by compressing and expanding the field of high frequency waves, the "chop". Through non-linear interactions, the chop responds with its own collective stiffness and inertia. This inertia should cause modulations of the chop amplitude to lag in phase behind the forcing from the swell. Two methods are presented for investigating the phase relationships between the chop amplitude and the swell. Method one employs the Fast Fourier Transform to examine directly the power levels at various frequencies.

Studies of the spectrophone frequency response obtained for mixtures of methane and carbon dioxide, with carbon dioxide concentrations of one percent and five percent, indicate that the presence of carbon dioxide serves to decrease the vibrational relaxation time in methane.
