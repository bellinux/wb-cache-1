In patients with massive pulmonary embolism, systemic thrombolysis {{is considered to be}} the treatment of choice, but surgical or catheter thrombectomy may be alternative emergency treatments. A 36 -year-old woman with massive pulmonary embolism and contraindications to thrombolytic therapy was treated with catheter thrombectomy using the Angiojet thrombectomy system. The procedure was successfully performed with an excellent immediate angiographic result {{at the site of the}} rheolytic thrombectomy. The clinical improvement was maintained while in-hospital and during a 4 -month follow-up period, with a decrease to a normal level of the peak systolic pulmonary pressure.

40|$|Femoral vein {{catheterization}} {{is often}} carried out during resuscitation and in critical care units. It is usually achieved via a blind, external landmark-guided technique, through manual localization of the femoral artery. However, this {{approach can be}} challenging in patients with severe shock because of absence or ambiguity of the arterial pulse. We report a case of inadvertent cannulation, with a large-bore catheter, of the right femoral artery, which was mistaken as a venous route for medication and massive transfusion. The large cannula caused direct mechanical obstruction, while intra-arterial medications induced vascular injury and vasospasm. Both factors led to thrombosis and occlusion of the right external iliac artery, thus jeopardizing the distal blood supply, and ultimately resulting in muscle necrosis of the involved limb, and the need <b>for</b> <b>thrombectomy</b> and extensive fasciotomy to salvage the extremity.

40|$|Nineteen {{patients}} in {{whom it was}} impossible to create an arteriovenous (AV) fistula were hemodialyzed with adult Hickman catheters as the sole vascular access. Catheter survival was 45 % at 1 year, with eight patients requiring two or three <b>catheters</b> <b>for</b> the continuation of their treatment. The probability of a patient still being dialyzed with a Hickman catheter at 1 year was 69 %. The calculated risk of developing the most frequent complications was 0. 07 / 100 <b>catheter</b> days <b>for</b> sepsis, 0. 4 / 100 <b>catheter</b> days <b>for</b> thrombosis, and 0. 06 / 100 <b>catheter</b> days <b>for</b> outflow obstruction.

40|$|Abstract. During {{coronary}} artery angiography, a catheter {{is used to}} inject a contrast dye into the coronary arteries. Due to the anatomical variation of the aorta and the coronary arteries in different humans, one common catheter cannot be used for all patients. The cardiologists test different <b>catheters</b> <b>for</b> a patient and select the best one according to the patient’s anatomy. To overcome these problems, we propose a computer-aided catheter selection procedure. In this paper we present our approach for patient specific optimal <b>catheter</b> selection <b>for</b> the angiography of the left {{coronary artery}} (LCA). It involves segmentation of the aorta and coronary arteries, finding the centerline and computing some geometric parameters. These parameters include curve angle of the LCA, LCA contralateral wall curve length, and the aorta cavity length. We then consider <b>catheters</b> <b>for</b> the LCA and compute the angles and lengths of the two curves {{as well as the}} distance between these curves. We suggest a catheter that is the closest one with respect to the patient’s arteries geometry. This solution avoids testing of many catheters during catheterization. The cardiologist already gets a recommendation about the optimal <b>catheter</b> <b>for</b> the patient prior to the intervention. ...|$|R

Since its introduction balloon atrial septostomy continues to be of major importance for the non-surgical creation of an atrial septal defect in neonates with inadequate mixing of pulmonary and systemic venous blood at atrial leveL The use of <b>catheters</b> <b>for</b> dilatation of peripheral artery stenosis was reported previously by Dotter and Judkins in 1964 (2).
