Chocolate shells, if insufficiently crystallised, show reduced resistance to oil-migration of fillings.

If considerable quanities of this crystallizable portion stay liquid after cooling they will later "post-crystallize" uncontrollably during storage.

40|$|Crystallization is {{the most}} {{critical}} step of the chocolate poduction process and for chocolate quality. For the continuous solidification of chocolate products three steps are needed: nucleation, precrystallization and cooling crystallization.

The precrystallized liquor already contains fat crystals but shows a liquid consistency. According to DSC measurements the solid fat content reaches values between 0. 2 and 2 % of fat in tempered masses. The main part of solidification occurs within the <b>cooling</b> <b>tunnel.</b> During this step more or less stable crystal modifications are formed.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to numerically and experimentally investigate the performance of a forced air agricultural produce <b>cooling</b> <b>tunnel.</b> A porous medium approach is used to represent the produce within the containers in the numerical model. The pressure loss coefficients associated with the porous media are determined experimentally, while the heat transfer coefficients are obtained using empirical relationships from the literature. Full scale experimental studies, within a production setting, indicate a high variation in initial product temperatures and varying cold room temperatures over time. The numerical model is modified based on these findings and compared with experimental results. The numerical model shows good agreement with experimental values of pressures and the discrepancies are reduced if leaks are estimated. The numerical and experimental transient temperature variations are shown to be in significant disagreement, which indicates that alternative methods of determining the heat transfer coefficient are required to accurately determine the performance...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOne of {{the most}} {{effective}} methods for increasing a gas turbine thermal efficiency, is using " fogging " at the axial compressor first stage. That is why some investigations have been made by scientists all over the world, {{in order to create a}} model that represents fairly the hydraulic behavior of the water droplets flowing through the first stage of the axial compressor that forms part of a gas turbine. However, few works have been made for analysis of such behavior on systems conformed by both <b>cooling</b> <b>tunnel</b> and first stage of axial compresor. The main previous work was made by Moreno et al., where only a compressor hydraulic behavior was taken into account. It is important to notice that only first stage of rotor and stator was simulated using CFD techniques. The objective of this paper is to simulate the system conformed by cooling-tunnel and first stage of an axial compressor, when considering fogging technique, since on previous works on literature both components have been studied separately. Several variables like dry-bulb temperatures, droplet sizes, water injection rates, air mass flow rates and others were combinely evaluated, in order to enhance an improvement on axial compressors thermal efficiency. The numerical analysis was performed using CFX simulator. Also this study could help improve gas turbines performance, which implies lower costs of operation. ...|$|E

A windcatcher is a chimney-like structure positioned above the house; the one of its four openings opposite the wind direction is opened to move air out of the house.

40|$|The {{performance}} of California kiwifruit packed using solid liners, perforated liners, and micro-perforated liners on {{the rate of}} initial cooling time, water loss, and quality attributes after shipping was evaluated under controlled laboratory and commercial conditions. Controlled cooling tests using a portable <b>cooling</b> <b>tunnel</b> indicated an important cooling time reduction (reaching 7 / 8 cooling time) without affecting quality when perforated liners were used instead of solid ones. The use of these vented box liners will result in direct energy savings to packinghouses proportional to the reduction in cooling times. Also, shorter cooling times will allow scheduling operations for the off-peak utility periods. Fruit quality attributes such as fruit firmness, soluble solids, and titratable acidity were not affected {{by any of the}} box liner treatments. Kiwifruit weight loss depended on the box liner vented area (V. A.) and storage temperature. After 18 weeks at 0 oC kiwifruit packed in the solid (0 % V. A.), perforated (0. 6 % V.

40|$|Papers {{presented}} to the 11 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 20 - 23 July 2015. The numerical results from a simple computational fluid dynamic model of a forced air agricultural produce <b>cooling</b> <b>tunnel</b> are compared with experimental measurements made on a full scale tunnel. The experimental tunnel consists of four pallets of produce each holding a number of boxes arranged in a specified, but non-uniform stacking order. The tunnel {{is located in a}} large cold storage room while the cold air is drawn at a steady rate through the boxes using a large axial flow fan. The time dependent temperature and pressure values are experimentally determined at a number of strategic locations within the tunnel. The experimentally determined values of the tunnel pressures as well as the produce temperature as functions of time are plotted in a non-dimensional manner. These are then compared with the results of the computational fluid dynamics model. In the model the boxes filled with the agricultural produce, cucumbers in this case, are approximated using porous jumps for the boxes and a non-isotropic porous media model with empirically determined coefficients for the produce. A commercially available finite volume package is used to solve for the time dependent temperature, pressure and flow field. The discrepancies between the experimental and numerical results are discussed and suggestions made for improving the numerical model. am 201...|$|E

This study aimed {{to evaluate the}} conservation of Torreon hybrid cantaloupe using the hydrocooling treatment. Fruits were harvested at the commercial maturity stage (60 days after planting), in the morning, at the Nova California Farm, municipality of Mossoró-RN, in September 2007. One set of fruit was immersed in chilled water at 5 ºC for 5 min, at the packing house, while the remaining set was not hydro cooled. Then, both sets (treated and untreated with hydrocooling) were pre-cooled in air forced tunnels at 7 ºC, until {{the temperature in the}} pulp reached 10 ºC. Both fruit sets were stored for 0, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days under modified atmosphere at 3 ± 1 oC and 90 ± 5 % RH. After each storage period, the fruits were incubated in an atmosphere-controlled chamber at 20 ± 2 oC and 80 ± 5 % de RH, for seven days. The following characteristics were evaluated: external and internal appearance, mass loss, soluble solids, firmness and titrable acidity. The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized split-plot design with four replications of three fruits. The plots consisted of the hydrocooling conditions (with and without fruit soaking in chilled water), and the sub-plots consisted of the storage times (0, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days).

A wind tower is a chimney-like structure positioned above the house; of its four openings, the one opposite the wind direction is opened to move air out of the house. Incoming air is pulled from a qanat below the house.

The air from the qanat is drawn into the tunnel at some distance away and is cooled both by contact with the <b>cool</b> <b>tunnel</b> walls/water and by the transfer of latent heat of evaporation as water evaporates into the air stream. In dry desert climates this can result in a greater than 15 °C reduction in the air temperature coming from the qanat; the mixed air still feels dry, so the basement is cool and only comfortably moist (not damp).

The designed product recipe consisted only of white sorghum, powdered grape seeds, honey, and dark chocolate. This essential composition was formulated in order to boost nutritional added value such as presence of polyphenols, high fiber content, low level of sodium, and a low caloric intake, all within an organic product, free of gluten and preservatives. A selected variety of white sorghum was the basic ingredient of the product: versatile, with nutritional properties similar to corn, sorghum has lower water requirements and withstands high temperatures brilliantly. In this product sorghum was transformed and used in three forms: as blown grain, as syrup (obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis of the grains) and as fiber (by-product of syrup production).

40|$|Filled chocolates are {{particularly}} susceptible to quality loss due to oil migration. Since the fillings are often softer than the chocolate coatings, the filling lipids can {{function as an}} activator for diffusion processes {{with the formation of}} fat bloom as a consequence. Filling lipids can merge with chocolate during production or storage. However, in most studies concerning crystallization or migration cocoa butter and hazelnut oil were analyzed, investigations on chocolate are rare. To cover a broad variety of fillings, dark chocolate was blended with hazelnut oil, butterfat, and coconut oil and crystallization was analyzed. All investigated lipids reduced the solid fat content to the same extend. However, crystallization behavior of the blended samples differed. Hazelnut oil accelerated crystallization rate and did not affect crystallization time, while butterfat reduced crystallization rate and time. The effect of coconut oil addition was in between those of hazelnut oil and butterfat. Nucleation and crystal growth rate, which affect the crystallization speed, {{have been shown to be}} affected by the type of filling lipid. Additionally, there is evidence that crystal transformation during crystallization is also affected by filling lipids. Practical applications: Based on the results of this study, manufacturers of filled chocolate products may adapt their processing parameters such as temperature and retention time in the <b>cooling</b> <b>tunnel</b> accordingly. The analytical methods may be used to control the production of confectionery and to determine filling fat concentrations in the chocolate shells of freshly produced pralines. As different filling lipids in small contents cause similar softening of chocolate shells, the solid fat content (SFC) of chocolate is an appropriate method to control filling lipid migration into chocolate. Isothermal crystallization of non-tempered samples shown as solid fat content (SFC) versus time indicate that hazelnut oil has a less retarding effect on crystallization than butterfat and the effect of coconut oil is in between, but closer to hazelnut oil...|$|E
