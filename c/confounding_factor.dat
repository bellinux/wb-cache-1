25|$|Despite the {{existence}} of a fossil record, full classification and phylogeny of the sturgeon species has been difficult to determine, in part due to the high individual and ontogenic variation, including geographical clines in certain features, such as rostrum shape, number of scutes and body length. A further <b>confounding</b> <b>factor</b> is the peculiar ability of sturgeons to produce reproductively viable hybrids, even between species assigned to different genera. While ray-finned fishes have a long evolutionary history culminating in our most familiar fishes, past adaptive radiations have left only a few survivors, like sturgeons and garfish.|$|E
25|$|Men are {{affected}} {{three times as}} often as women. There is also marked geographic variation in the prevalence of IgA nephropathy throughout the world. It {{is the most common}} glomerular disease in the Far East and Southeast Asia, accounting for almost half of all the patients with glomerular disease. However, it accounts for only about 25% of the proportion in European and about 10% among North Americans, with African–Americans having a very low prevalence of about 2%. However, a <b>confounding</b> <b>factor</b> in this analysis is the existing policy of screening and use of kidney biopsy as an investigative tool. School children in Japan undergo routine urinalysis (as do army recruits in Singapore) and any suspicious abnormality is pursued with a kidney biopsy, which might partly explain the high observed incidence of IgA nephropathy in those countries.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept for}} Tomb Raider {{originated}} in 1993 at Core Design, a British game development studio. One {{of the men}} most involved in its creation was Toby Gard, who was mostly responsible for creating the character of Lara Croft. Gard originally envisioned her as a man: company co-founder Jeremy Heath-Smith was worried the character {{would be seen as}} derivative of Indiana Jones, so Gard changed the character's gender. Her design underwent multiple revisions and redrafts during early development. The game proved an unexpected commercial success, reversing Eidos' then-bleak financial situation. After the success of Tomb Raider, work began almost at once on a sequel. After the first game's success, Gard was no longer given full creative control, and it was stated by development staff that he was both saddened and disappointed by the use of Lara Croft's sex appeal in marketing. Gard left Core Design in 1997 to found his own gaming company <b>Confounding</b> <b>Factor,</b> and was replaced by Stuart Atkinson. Tomb Raider II proved even more of a commercial success than the original.|$|E

40|$|Although {{there is}} a {{cumulative}} evidence for the inflammation pathophysiology in schizophrenia, {{it has not been}} conclusively proven yet. One reason for this is the lack of studies that have controlled for major <b>confounding</b> <b>factors</b> such as obesity, smoking, antipsychotic use, and stress. The studies in which the major <b>confounding</b> <b>factors</b> were controlled were done in subjects in acute relapse and in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. To date, no studies have been done in stable outpatients with schizophrenia controlling for major <b>confounding</b> <b>factors.</b> Data on cerebrospinal fluid cytokines in large sample independent of <b>confounding</b> <b>factors</b> are also lacking.

500|$|Drinking alcohol {{excessively}} is a {{major cause}} of chronic pancreatitis, which in turn predisposes to pancreatic cancer. [...] However, considerable research has failed to firmly establish alcohol consumption as a direct risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Overall, the association is consistently weak and the majority of studies have found no association, with smoking a strong <b>confounding</b> <b>factor.</b> The evidence is stronger for a link with heavy drinking, of at least six drinks per day.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that unusual behavior hours or even days beforehand could be triggered by foreshock activity at magnitudes {{that most people do}} not notice. Another <b>confounding</b> <b>factor</b> of accounts of unusual phenomena is skewing due to [...] "flashbulb memories": otherwise unremarkable details become more memorable and more significant when associated with an emotionally powerful event such as an earthquake. A study that attempted to control for these kinds of factors found an increase in unusual animal behavior (possibly triggered by foreshocks) in one case, but not in four other cases of seemingly similar earthquakes.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{background}} radiation for occupational doses includes radiation {{that is not}} measured by radiation dose instruments in potential occupational exposure conditions. This includes both offsite [...] "natural {{background radiation}}" [...] and any medical radiation doses. This value is not typically measured or known from surveys, such that variations in the total dose to individual workers is not known. This can be a significant <b>confounding</b> <b>factor</b> in assessing radiation exposure effects in a population of workers who may have significantly different natural background and medical radiation doses. This is most significant when the occupational doses are very low.|$|E
30|$|An {{important}} {{assumption of}} the generalized propensity score approach is the “weak unconfoundedness” assumption, which states that all important <b>confounding</b> <b>factors</b> {{are included in the}} treatment assignment model (i.e., Eqs. (3) and (4)). This assumption suggests that we should collect as many covariates as possible when designing an observational study to guard against missing any important <b>confounding</b> <b>factors.</b> We have identified and included all important confounders available from the wadeable stream assessment dataset, which was created by the EPA (Table  1). However, we may have missed some potentially important <b>confounding</b> <b>factors</b> that were not observed, such as site history and variability of flow velocity. Nevertheless, we have controlled some of the potential covariates and strengthened the estimation of the nutrient’s causal effect on invertebrate richness. Many unobserved <b>confounding</b> <b>factors</b> are likely to be correlated with these observed covariates and are thus partially controlled for as well.|$|R

For an observational science to be valid, the experimenter must know and account for <b>confounding</b> <b>factors.</b> In these situations, observational studies have value because they often suggest hypotheses that can be tested with randomized experiments or by collecting fresh data.|$|R

Such complications demonstrate the need for studies on cannabis that have stronger controls, and investigations into alleged symptoms of cannabis use that may also be caused by tobacco. Some critics question whether agencies doing the research make an honest effort to present an accurate, unbiased summary of the evidence, or whether they [...] "cherry-pick" [...] their data to please funding sources which may include the tobacco industry or governments dependent on cigarette tax revenue; others caution that the raw data, and not the final conclusions, are what should be examined.|$|E

However, {{we have not yet}} been able to draw more detailed conclusions about firm structure or about the use of revenue due to a number of <b>confounding</b> <b>factors.</b> We explain these <b>confounding</b> <b>factors</b> and suggest a number of possible explanations for the apparent relationship between employees and growth.

We contribute to current debates on qualitative research designs by using Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the performance of different case selection techniques or algorithms.

We also demonstrate that causal inferences from qualitative research become much less reliable when the variable of interest is strongly correlated with <b>confounding</b> <b>factors,</b> when {{the effect of the}} variable of interest becomes small relative to the effect of the <b>confounding</b> <b>factors,</b> and when researchers analyze dichotomous de-pendent variables...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the role}} of genetic {{variation}} in human diseases remains an important problem to be solved in genomics. An important component of such variation consist of variations at single sites in DNA, or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Typically, the problem of associating particular SNPs to phenotypes has been <b>confounded</b> by hidden <b>factors</b> such {{as the presence of}} population structure, family structure or cryptic relatedness in the sample of individuals being analyzed. Such <b>confounding</b> <b>factors</b> lead to a large number of spurious associations and missed associations. Various statistical methods have been proposed to account for such <b>confounding</b> <b>factors</b> such as linear mixed-effect models (LMMs) or methods that adjust data based on a principal components analysis (PCA), but these methods either suffer from low power or cease to be tractable for larger numbers of individuals in the sample. Here we present a statistical model for conducting genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that accounts for such <b>confounding</b> <b>factors.</b> Our method scales in runtime quadratic in the number of individuals being studied with only a modest loss in statistical power as compared to LMMbased and PCA-based methods when testing on synthetic data that was generated from a generalized LMM. Applying our method to both real and synthetic human genotype/phenotype data, we demonstrate the ability of our model to correct for <b>confounding</b> <b>factors</b> while requiring significantly less runtime relative to LMMs. We have implemented methods fo...|$|R
