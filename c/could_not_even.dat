5|$|Another {{possible}} {{argument that}} has been proposed by C. S. Lewis is the Argument from Reason: if, as monism implies, all of our thoughts are the effects of physical causes, then {{we have no reason}} for assuming that they are also the consequent of a reasonable ground. Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if monism is correct, there would be no way of knowing this—or anything else—we <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> suppose it, except by a fluke.|$|E
5|$|On this occasion, {{an unknown}} number of fire engines were either wheeled or dragged through the streets, some from across the City. The piped water had already failed which they were {{designed}} to use, but parts of the river bank could still be reached. Gangs of men tried desperately to manoeuvre the engines right up to the river to fill their reservoirs, and several of the engines toppled into the Thames. The heat from the flames by then was too great for the remaining engines to get within a useful distance; they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> get into Pudding Lane.|$|E
5|$|Another notable {{king of the}} Anuradhapura Kingdom is Valagamba (103, 89–77 BC), {{also known}} as Vatthagamani Abhaya, who was overthrown by five invaders from South India. He regained his throne after {{defeating}} these invaders {{one by one and}} unified the country again under his rule. Saddha Tissa (137–119 BC), Mahaculi Mahatissa (77–63 BC), Vasabha (67–111), Gajabahu I (114–136), Dhatusena (455–473), Aggabodhi I (571–604) and Aggabodhi II (604–614) were among the rulers who held sway over the entire country after Dutthagamani and Valagamba. Rulers from Kutakanna Tissa (44–22 BC) to Amandagamani (29–19 BC) also managed to keep the whole country under the rule of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. Other rulers could not maintain their rule over the whole island, and independent regions often existed in Ruhuna and Malayarata (hill country) for limited periods. During the final years of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, rebellions sprang up and the authority of the kings gradually declined. By the time of Mahinda V (982–1017), the last king of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, the rule of the king had become so weak that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> properly organize the collection of taxes.|$|E

5|$|The state {{suffered}} from financial difficulties {{during its first}} three decades. Jonathan Jennings attempted to begin a period of internal improvements. Among his projects, the Indiana Canal Company was reestablished to build a canal around the Falls of the Ohio. The Panic of 1819 caused the state's only two banks to fold. This hurt Indiana's credit, halted the projects, and hampered the start of new projects until the 1830s, after the repair of the state's finances during the terms of William Hendricks and Noah Noble. Beginning in 1831, large scale plans for statewide improvements were set into motion. Overspending on the internal improvements led to a large deficit {{that had to be}} funded by state bonds through the newly created Bank of Indiana and sale of over nine million acres (36,000km²) of public land. By 1841 the debt had become unmanageable. Having borrowed over $13million, the equivalent to the state's first fifteen years of tax revenue, the government <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> pay interest on the debt. The state narrowly avoided bankruptcy by negotiating the liquidation of the public works, transferring them to the state's creditors in exchange for a 50% reduction in the state's debt. The internal improvements began under Jennings paid off as the state began to experience rapid population growth that slowly remedied the state's funding problems. The improvements led to a fourfold increase in land value, and an even larger increase in farm produce.|$|E

25|$|Early {{citizens}} <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> {{maintain a}} footbridge {{over the river}} {{from one side of}} the city to the other. After the American takeover, the city council authorized spending of $20,000 for a contractor to build a substantial wooden bridge across the river. The first storm to come along dislodged the bridge, used it as a battering ram to break through the embankment, and scattered its timbers all the way to the sea.|$|E

25|$|In 1898, Kelvin {{predicted}} that only 400 years of oxygen supply {{remained on the}} planet, due to the rate of burning combustibles. In his calculation, Kelvin assumed that photosynthesis was {{the only source of}} free oxygen; he did not know all of the components of the oxygen cycle. He <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> have known all of the sources of photosynthesis: for example the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus—which accounts {{for more than half of}} marine photosynthesis—was not discovered until 1986.|$|E

25|$|Rosh Hashanah. Because {{of holiday}} {{restrictions}} on travel, messengers <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> leave {{the seat of}} the Sanhedrin until the holiday was over.

Accordingly, the practice emerged that Rosh Hashanah was observed on both possible days, as calculated from the previous month's start, everywhere in the world.|$|E

25|$|Penn {{returned}} to England and immediately became embroiled in financial and family troubles.

25|$|The {{immediate}} effect of collapse of Nova was the sudden unemployment of approximately 4,500 foreign teaching staff and 2,000 Japanese workers.

Some teachers <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> afford a plane ticket home.
