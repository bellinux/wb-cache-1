40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{activity of}} various plant extracts on Pseudomonas bacteria isolated from spoiled chilled tilapia (Oreochromis sp.) was evaluated in this study. In {{the first stage}} of this study, red tilapia was subjected to chilled storage (4 °C) for 3 weeks, and spoilage bacteria were isolated and identified from the spoiled fish. Pseudomonas was the dominant bacteria isolated from the spoiled fish and further identification revealed that P. putida, P. fluorescens and Pseudomonas spp. were the main species of this group. In the second stage, methanolic extracts of 15 selected plant species were screened for their antimicrobial activity, by agar disc diffusion method, against the Pseudomonas isolates. Results indicated that most of the extracts had different degrees of activity against the bacterial isolates. The strongest activity was exhibited by bottlebrush flower (Callistemon viminalis) extract. This was followed by extracts from guava bark (Psidium guajava) and henna leaf (Lawsonia inermis). Moderate antimicrobial activities were observed in extracts of <b>clove</b> (Syzygium aromaticum), <b>leaf</b> and peel of tamarind (Tamarindus indica), cinnamon bark (Cinnamomum zeylanicum), wild betel leaf (Piper sarmentosum) and fresh thyme (Thymus spp.). Weak or no antimicrobial activity was observed from the remaining extracts. The potential antimicrobial activity shown by some plant extracts in this study could significantly contribute to the fish preservation...|$|R
40|$|Dental caries is {{the most}} common {{infectious}} disease affecting humans. The main causative agents of this disease are bacteria especially group of streptococcal species. This study has examined the potential of using essential oils/antioxidants to control the growth of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus oralis in vitro in tryptone soya broth and a saliva medium in the presence and absence of sodium fluoride. A total of 9 essential oils and three antioxidants were screened using a clearing zone method. This showed that two essential oils (<b>clove</b> <b>leaf,</b> and cinnamon oils) and two antioxidants (butyl hydroxy anisole and propyl gallate) were the most effective. These were then tested at up to 10 % concentration for inhibition of cell viability of both S. mutans and S. oralis. The ED 50 and ED 90 concentrations of these four compounds were determined. Studies were then carried out to examine the potential of integrating these compounds with sodium fluoride for inhibition of these two oral bacteria. Concentrations of 0. 5 and 1 % of the essential oils/antioxidants + 2000 ppm sodium fluoride was able to completely inhibit growth of populations of both bacteria in TSB medium. Studies in an artificial saliva medium showed that these mixture were still effective resulting in > 75 % decrease in populations after treatment for 24 hrs. Ecological studies using the Bioscreen system showed that S. mutans and S. oralis could grow well at pH 5 - 7, but much more slowly at pH 4 as indicated by the times to detection and the increase in lag times prior to growth initiation. An increase in NaCl concentration from 1 to 6 % (= 0. 999 to 0. 97 water activity) showed a similar result for both bacteria...|$|E
