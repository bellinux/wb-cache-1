60|$|The impelling power {{which causes}} the great fabric to advance also sets in motion the {{machinery}} within it As {{soon as the}} heads of the grain are severed from the stalks, they pass into a receptacle, where, by a very quick and simple process, the kernels are separated from the husks. Thence all goes into a fanning machine, where the chaff is blown away. The <b>clean</b> <b>grain</b> falls into a small bin, whence it is raised by a screw elevator to a height that enables it to pass out at an opening to which a bag is attached. Wagons follow the slow march of the machine, and the proper number of men are in attendance. Bag after bag is renewed, until a wagon is loaded, when it at once proceeds to the mill, where the grain is soon converted into flour. Generally the husbandman sells to the miller, but occasionally he pays for making the flour, and sends the latter off, by railroad, to Detroit, whence it finds its way to Europe, possibly, to help feed the millions of the old world. Such, at least, was the course of trade the past season. As respects this ingenious machine, it remains only to say that it harvests, cleans, and bags from twenty to thirty acres of heavy wheat, {{in the course of a}} single summer's day! Altogether it is a gigantic invention, well adapted to meet the necessities of a gigantic country.|$|E

40|$|There are two {{components}} of quality in malting barley: {{the first is}} grain quality {{and the second is}} malt quality. To ensure that malt of the highest quality is produced during the time-limited malting process, the barley must be able to germinate vigorously and uniformly. It has been proposed that black point can affect the germination of barley grains. As a consequence, black pointed grain is routinely downgraded from malt quality to feed quality resulting in substantial losses to the grower. However limited research has been carried out to determine whether black pointed grains behave differently to <b>clean</b> <b>grains</b> during the malting process. Our research found that black point did not reduce germination energy of the grain, with black pointed grains able to germinate as readily as <b>clean</b> <b>grains.</b> This paper discusses germination energy, alphaamylase activity and microscopic investigation of the grain in relation to grain viability and black point, to determine the suitability of black point discoloured grain for use in malting.

The weed seed contamination of <b>cleaned</b> <b>grain</b> and herbicide resistance levels of the recovered weed seeds were examined in a study conducted across 74 farms in the Western Australian grainbelt. Most farmers grew and conserved their own crop seed. The majority of cleaned samples had some level of seed contamination from 11 foreign weed and volunteer crop species, with an average of 62 seeds 10 kg− 1 grain, substantially higher than the 28 seeds 10 kg− 1 grain expected by farmers. The most common weed contaminants across all samples were rigid ryegrass, wild radish, brome, and wild oat. When categorized by crop type, rigid ryegrass was the most frequent contaminant of cereal crops (barley and wheat), however wild radish was the most frequent contaminant of lupin crops. Uncleaned crop seed samples had almost 25 times more contamination than cleaned crop seed. Herbicide resistance was highly prevalent within rigid ryegrass populations recovered from <b>cleaned</b> <b>grain</b> except for glyphosate, which controlled all populations tested. Some resistance was also found in wild radish and wild oat populations; however, brome was susceptible to fluazifop.

5000|$|Grain Mass flow is most {{commonly}} measured using a load cell with an impact plate {{attached to the}} load cell located {{at the top of}} the <b>clean</b> <b>grain</b> elevator. As the <b>clean</b> <b>grain</b> elevator paddles rotate around the top of the <b>clean</b> <b>grain</b> elevator, the grain is expelled from the elevator by centrifugal force and makes contact with the impact plate attached to the load cell.

5000|$|Several factors {{affect the}} {{accuracy}} of the calibration beyond the calibration itself.

[...] Excessive wear of the <b>clean</b> <b>grain</b> elevator paddles over time will also affect the mass flow calibration.

40|$|The water {{retention}} properties {{of a natural}} loess from Northern France were investigated on intact block samples that were excavated along a high speed train line (TGV) that experienced stability problems during heavy rain episodes. Suction measurements were made by using the filter paper method and a home made high capacity tensiometer (HCT) so as to determine the {{water retention}} curve of the loess. The results showed that an alternative approach using a previously wetted filter paper could fruitfully be used with suction values fairly compatible with the HCT measurements. The water retention curve obtained exhibited a peculiar form with no hysteresis observed around the natural water content (14. 4 %) and two hysteresis loops on both the wet and dry sides of the curve. This zone with no hysteresis is supposed to correspond to the natural variations of the water content under seasonal changes, providing a range of natural suction between 20 and 80 kPa that should obviously checked by in-situ measurements. The loess microstructure was investigated by using scanning electron microscope and mercury intrusion porosimetry. It appeared that the clay fraction (16 %) was not uniformly distributed with some areas composed of <b>clean</b> <b>grains</b> and a well graded corresponding inter-grains pore population. Conversely, the clay aggregations define a smaller sized porosity.

It is used in many cases, dependent upon manufacturer, in the grain mass flow sensor calibration and provides producers with additional information about spatial variability within a field.

Mycotoxins producing species like Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus ochraceus and Penicillium cyclopium were detected in the stored grains and in mechanically-cleaned grains. The species of Penicillium, Alternaria and Fusarium genera dominated in roughly-milled flour samples, so this site of flour manufacture still has a risk and danger of contamination with mycotoxins producing fungus.

Pilot-scale tests showed that <b>clean</b> <b>grain</b> transferred over infested boots was infested with about 1 insect/kg when transferred immediately after the boot was infested; this increased to 2 insects/kg after incubating the boot for 8 wk.
