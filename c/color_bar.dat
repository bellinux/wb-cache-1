25|$|Because he {{was black}} and {{the bulk of his}} career was played before Jackie Robinson broke baseball's <b>color</b> <b>bar,</b> Perucho Cepeda could not play in the major leagues. Several players from the Negro leagues visited their house, which {{influenced}} his view of the sport. He became a fan of Minnie Miñoso, following his career in the Cuban League, Negro leagues, Major League Baseball, and the Caribbean.|$|E
25|$|The <b>color</b> <b>bar</b> {{remained}} in force even under Johnson. Once {{he was the}} world's heavyweight champ, Johnson did not fight a black opponent {{for the first five}} years of his reign. He denied matches to black heavyweights Joe Jeanette (one of his successors as colored heavyweight champ), Sam Langford (who beat Jeanette for the colored title), and the young Harry Wills, who was colored heavyweight champ during the last year of Johnson's reign as world's heavyweight champ.|$|E
25|$|A protégé {{of black}} activist and {{educator}} Mary McLeod Bethune, Roundtree {{was selected by}} Bethune for the first class of African-American women to be trained as officers in the newly created Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (later the Women's Army Corps) during World War II. In 1961 she {{became one of the}} first women to receive full ministerial status in the African Methodist Episcopal Church, which had just begun ordaining women at a level beyond mere preachers in 1960. With her controversial admission to the all-white Women's Bar of the District of Columbia in 1962, she broke the <b>color</b> <b>bar</b> for minority women in the Washington legal community. In one of Washington's most sensational and widely covered murder cases, United States v. Ray Crump, tried in the summer of 1965 on the eve of the Watts riots, Roundtree won acquittal for the black laborer accused of the murder of Georgetown socialite (and former wife of a CIA officer) Mary Pinchot Meyer, a woman with romantic ties to President John F. Kennedy.|$|E

2500|$|Davis {{also worked}} as a sports reporter, in {{particular}} covering the rivalry between African-American boxer Joe Louis and the German Max Schmeling. He and other writers portrayed their confrontation as democracy and equality vs. fascism. Davis believed that sports was a field in which men could break the <b>color</b> <b>bar,</b> and {{was a way to}} reach out to a working class. [...] During the Great Depression, Davis participated in the federal Federal Writers' Project, under the Works Progress Administration and part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. In 1937 he received a Julius Rosenwald Fellowship, funded by the president of Sears Roebuck, who became a major philanthropist.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, a [...] "gentlemen's agreement" [...] was struck between the clubs to exclude non-white players from {{professional}} baseball, a bar that remained until 1947. It {{is a common}} misconception that Jackie Robinson was the first African-American major-league ballplayer; he was actually only the first after a long gap (and {{the first in the}} modern era). Moses Fleetwood Walker and his brother Welday Walker were unceremoniously dropped from major and minor-league rosters in the 1880s, as were other African-Americans in baseball. An unknown number of African-Americans played in the major leagues by representing themselves as Indians, or South or Central Americans, and a still larger number played in the minor leagues and on amateur teams as well. In the majors, however, {{it was not until the}} signing of Robinson (in the National League) and Larry Doby (in the American League) that baseball began to remove its <b>color</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1983, {{he opened}} the {{satellite}} dealership MacDougall Electronics in Ocala. The company initially turned a healthy profit, but following the scrambling of HBO's signal on January 15, 1986, its turnover declined. Consequently, he reduced his expenses where possible {{and in the same}} month was offered a part-time job at the Central Florida Teleport uplink station (which uplinked services to satellites) as an operations engineer to help him pay his bills. As he was not receiving any customers, MacDougall pulled all company advertising and saved money by switching off his air conditioning. He became increasingly reclusive during this period, watching television and reading magazines. MacDougall later said of the experience: [...] "I have been watching the great American dream slip from my grasp." [...] At 12:49a.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) on April 20, one week before the jamming, MacDougall transmitted a <b>color</b> <b>bar</b> test pattern that was superimposed on HBO's signal. This only lasted for a few seconds, and HBO did not investigate the incident as it had occurred during the overnight hours, and as a result very few people had been watching at the time.|$|E
50|$|When {{converting}} {{between the}} various HD and SD formats, it would be correct {{to compensate for the}} differences in the primaries (e.g. between the Rec. 709, EBU Tech 3213, and SMPTE C primaries). In practice, this conversion is rarely performed and such a conversion would create a liability for post production facilities as they would need to ensure that the <b>color</b> <b>bars</b> on all the new masters are redone. Correcting for differences in the primaries would cause the resulting <b>color</b> <b>bars</b> on the converted tape to be inaccurate. Incorrect <b>color</b> <b>bars</b> will cause a (sub)master to be rejected by quality control checks.|$|R

The 100% bars represent the maximum amplitude (of the composite signal) that composite encoding allows for. 100% bars are not suitable for broadcast and are not broadcast-safe. 75% bars have reduced amplitude and are broadcast-safe.|$|R

After April 2002, with the release of HMIS III, yellow in the <b>color</b> <b>bar</b> (which stood for reactivity) was replaced by orange, standing for physical hazard. The fire diamond is designed for emergencies when information about the effects of short, or acute, exposure is needed. The <b>color</b> <b>bar</b> is not for emergencies and is used to convey broader health warning information.|$|E
