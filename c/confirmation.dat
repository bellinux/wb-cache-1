40|$|The {{literature}} on the electronic mail game shows that players' mutual expectations may lock them into requiring an inefficiently large number of <b>confirmations</b> and <b>confirmations</b> of <b>confirmations</b> from one another.

We show that, once this assumption is lifted, equilibria involving <b>confirmations</b> of <b>confirmations</b> no longer pass standard refinements of the Nash equilibrium, and are no longer evolutionary stable. ...|$|R

5|$|The Catholic Church {{sees the}} sacrament of <b>confirmation</b> as {{required}} to complete the grace given in baptism. When adults are baptised, <b>confirmation</b> is normally given immediately afterwards, a practice followed even with newly baptised infants in the Eastern Catholic Churches. In the West <b>confirmation</b> of children is delayed until they {{are old enough to}} understand or at the bishop's discretion. In Western Christianity, particularly Catholicism, the sacrament is called <b>confirmation,</b> because it confirms and strengthens the grace of baptism; in the Eastern Churches, it is called chrismation, because the essential rite is the anointing of the person with chrism, a mixture of olive oil and some perfumed substance, usually balsam, blessed by a bishop. Those who receive <b>confirmation</b> must be in a state of grace, which for those who have reached the age of reason means that they should first be cleansed spiritually by {{the sacrament of}} Penance; they should also have the intention of receiving the sacrament, and be prepared to show in their lives that they are Christians.|$|E

50|$|The second {{preliminary}} church executive (link=no) of the Confessing German Evangelical Church, paralleling {{the official}} bodies, {{was of the}} opinion that the <b>confirmations</b> were not to be delayed. Since fathers, being state officials and/or card-carrying Nazi partisans, were ordered to organise and implement the poll as election judges and with relatives travelling all around Germany to participate in their relatives' or godchildren's <b>confirmations,</b> the Nazis feared a low turnout in the election. This made the <b>confirmations</b> on the traditional date a political issue.|$|R

40|$|Accounts {{receivable}} <b>confirmations</b> {{are firmly}} established and widely {{accepted by the}} auditing profession. However, {{the results of this}} research raise serious questions about the effectiveness of this procedure. This study empirically tested the effectiveness of accounts receivable <b>confirmations</b> sent to individual retail customers, and examined the attitudes of external auditors regarding this procedure. ^ The research consisted of a field study and questionnaire survey. In the field study, correct and intentionally misstated <b>confirmations</b> were sent to a random sample of 500 customers from a manufacturing company. They were equally divided between positives and negatives. Misstatements were either five or 10 percent with equal numbers of overstatements and understatements. A questionnaire was sent to a random sample of 300 members of the AICPA employed as auditors in public accounting. ^ Detection rates for positives ranged from 10 to 52 percent with an overall detection rate of 38 percent. Detection rates for second requests were lower than first requests across all independent variables. Detection rates for negative <b>confirmations</b> ranged from four to 30 percent with an overall detection rate of 16. 5 percent. The detection rate for negatives was significantly lower (p 3 ̆c. 000) than positives using both ANOVA and chi-square analysis. ^ Even though this research indicates that accounts receivable <b>confirmations</b> are not highly effective, auditors rely on them. Substantially all respondents to the questionnaire indicated they regularly use positive and/or negative <b>confirmations.</b> Also, auditors 2 ̆ 7 expectations of the percentage of errors in the account balances that would be detected through <b>confirmations</b> were 20 to 25 percent higher than the actual detection rates from the field study. This result held for both positive and negative <b>confirmations.</b> Based on this research, it appears that auditors rely on accounts receivable <b>confirmations,</b> yet they do not fully realize the level of effectiveness of the procedure and thus may be putting themselves at more risk than they anticipate. ...|$|R

5|$|HAT-P-33b was {{difficult}} to confirm because its star experiences high jitter, which disrupted the ability to obtain accurate measurements.
