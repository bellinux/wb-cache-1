40|$|Abstract. A {{total of}} 24 bee colonies of apiaries with {{different}} business orientation were {{tested for the}} degree of expression of hygienic behaviour by modified method, different from the traditionally {{used for this purpose}} method. To outline the test field a square sized 5 x 5 cm was used, stuck onto a section of a honey comb with sealed worker brood (the area bounded by the stencil is equal to 100 worker bee cells). The brood in the outlined square is killed by a thin entomological needle by jabbing the sealed cells, without destroying their caps. Depending on the time and extent of <b>cleaning</b> <b>bee</b> colonies are divided into 3 th groups: super hygienic - colonies which of the 24 hour after the jabbing have uncovered and cleaned over 95...|$|E
5000|$|The factor causing slow mite {{population}} growth {{was found to}} be heritable. The rate of mite {{population growth}} {{was found to be}} correlated with the reproductive rates of mites, resulting in naming the factor “suppressed mite reproduction” (SMR). It was subsequently discovered that the factor is founded on hygienic activity of adult bees, so SMR was renamed VSH. The behavior involves the recognition of infested brood by nest <b>cleaning</b> <b>bees</b> (aged 15-18 days old). Mite-infested bee pupae are either eaten or pulled from their brood cells, this results in the death of any immature varroa mites present.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Duplicate record {{detection}} {{is important}} for data preprocessing and <b>cleaning.</b> Artificial <b>Bee</b> Colony (ABC) {{is one of the}} most recently introduced algorithms based on the intelligent foraging behavior of a honey bee swarm. Our approach to duplicate detection is the use of ABC algorithm for generating the optimal similarity measure to decide whether the data is duplicate or not. In the training phase, ABC algorithm is used to generate the optimal similarity measure. Once the optimal similarity measure obtained, the deduplication of remaining datasets is done with the help of optimal similarity measure generated from the ABC algorithm. We have used Restaurant and Cora datasets to analyze the proposed algorithm and the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared against the genetic programming technique with the help of evaluation metrics...|$|R
50|$|When <b>cleaning</b> {{infected}} cells, <b>bees</b> distribute spores {{throughout the}} entire colony. Disease spreads rapidly throughout the hive as the bees, attempting to remove the spore-laden dead larvae, contaminate brood food. Nectar stored in contaminated cells will contain spores and soon the brood chamber becomes filled with contaminated honey. As this honey is moved up into the supers, the entire hive becomes contaminated with spores. When the colony becomes weak from AFB infection, robber bees may enter and take contaminated honey back to their hives thereby spreading the disease to other colonies and apiaries. Beekeepers also may spread disease by moving equipment (frames or supers) from contaminated hives to healthy ones.|$|R
40|$|Alarm {{pheromone}} and {{its major}} component isopentylacetate induce stress-like responses in forager honey bees, impairing {{their ability to}} associate odors with a food reward. We investigated whether isopentylacetate exposure decreases appetitive learning also in young worker bees. While isopentylacetate-induced learning deficits were observed in guards and foragers collected from a queen-right colony, learning impairments resulting from exposure to this pheromone could not be detected in <b>bees</b> <b>cleaning</b> cells. As cell cleaners are generally among the youngest workers in the colony, effects of isopentylacetate on learning behavior were examined further using bees of known age. Adult workers were maintained under laboratory conditions {{from the time of}} adult emergence. Fifty percent of the bees were exposed to queen mandibular pheromone during this period, whereas control bees were not exposed to this pheromone. Isopentylacetate-induced learning impairments were apparent in young (less than one week old) controls, but not in bees of the same age exposed to queen mandibular pheromone. This study reveals young worker bees can exhibit a stress-like response to alarm pheromone, but isopentylacetate-induced learning impairments in young bees are suppressed by queen mandibular pheromone. While isopentylacetate exposure reduced responses during associative learning (acquisition), it did not affect one-hour memory retrieval...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{some important}} physiological and pheromonal factors regulating foraging and colony growth in honey bee colonies. The first study analyzed effects of soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) {{on the development}} of hypopharyngeal gland, midgut enzyme activity and survival of the honey bee. In this study newly emerged caged bees were fed pollen diets containing three different concentrations of SBTI. Bees fed 1 % SBTI had significantly reduced hypopharyngeal gland protein content. This study indicated that nurse bees fed a pollen diet containing at least 1 % SBTI would be poor producers of larval food. In the second study nurse bee biosynthesis of brood food was manipulated using SBTI, and the resulting effects on pollen foraging were measured. Experimental colonies were given equal amounts of SBTI treated and untreated pollen. SBTI treatments had significantly lower hypopharyngeal gland protein content than controls. There {{was no significant difference in}} the ratio of pollen to non-pollen foragers and pollen load weights collected between the treatments. These results supported the pollen foraging effort predictions generated from the direct independent effects hypothesis. In the third study we tested whether brood pheromone (BP) regulated queen egg laying via modulation of worker-queen interactions and nurse bee rearing behaviors. This experiment had BP and control treatments. Queens in the BP treatment laid greater number of eggs, were fed for a greater amount of time and were less idle. Significantly more time was spent in cell <b>cleaning</b> by the <b>bees</b> in BP treatments. The results suggest that brood pheromone regulated queen egg-laying rate by modulating worker-queen interactions and nurse bee rearing behavior. The final study of this dissertation focused on how dose-dependent BP-mediated division of labor affected the partitioning of non-foraging and foraging work forces and the amount of brood reared. Triple cohort colonies were used and there were three treatments, Low BP, High BP and Control. Low BP treatments had significantly higher ratio of pollen to non-pollen foragers and greater pollen load weights. Low BP treatment bees foraged at a significantly younger age. This study has shown that BP elicits dose-dependent modulation of foraging and brood rearing behaviors...|$|R
