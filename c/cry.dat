5|$|Harmon {{thought that}} Far <b>Cry</b> 4 was an {{improvement}} over Far <b>Cry</b> 3, but {{he thought that the}} game felt and played too similarly to Far <b>Cry</b> 3, and he added that the game was unambitious. Bertz thought that Ubisoft Montreal's vision for Far <b>Cry</b> 4 is not as bold as its predecessors, and also thought that the experience delivered by Far <b>Cry</b> 4 did not stray far away from Far <b>Cry</b> 3. Tan also noted that the game's open world design felt not only similar to Far <b>Cry</b> 3, but also other Ubisoft franchises like Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs. Evans-Thirlwell thought that the experience offered by Far <b>Cry</b> 4 was hollow as it had failed to innovate or reinvent its wheel. Dyer thought that the game was not ambitious, but the experience delivered was still gratifying and rewarding.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the development of young children's recognition of fake <b>crying.</b> Sixty-two children aged from 3 to 6 were studied individually.

Their answers were classified into three groups based on their <b>crying</b> task performances (low. middle. and high). The results revealed that children in the low group did not distinguish fake <b>crying</b> from real <b>crying</b> and they recognized that both expressions would attract attention and elicit helping behavior by others to help them. In turn, children in the middle group were able to distinguish fake <b>crying</b> from real <b>crying.</b> Lastly, children in the high group not only distinguished between these types of <b>crying,</b> but also they clearly recognized that fake <b>crying</b> would deceive others...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the effect of}} infant <b>crying</b> on parental affect, state anxiety and parenting self-efficacy in an experimental setting. Background: Infant <b>crying</b> causes distress and feelings of incompetence in many parents. These frustrating parental feelings can lead to suboptimal caregiving behaviour or even child abuse. Studies focusing {{on the effects of}} infant <b>crying</b> experience causality issues, as parental behaviour can also increase infant <b>crying.</b> Methods: One hundred and sixteen students of Tilburg University were asked to babysit a life-like <b>crying</b> doll for 10 minutes. Participants were exposed to either no <b>crying,</b> 5 minutes of <b>crying,</b> or 10 minutes of <b>crying.</b> Results: Participants in the <b>crying</b> conditions experienced more negative affect, state anxiety, and felt less confident about their ability to parent in the future. Conclusion: These findings have implications for the parents of newborn babies who experience distress and feelings of incompetence caused by infant <b>crying.</b> Keywords: infant <b>crying,</b> affect, state anxiety, parenting self-efficacy, experimen...|$|R

Study 1 showed that, in the absence of information about the social context of <b>crying,</b> participants inferred gender-stereotypical traits and emotions. Study 2 's manipulation of the social context of <b>crying</b> (relationship versus employment) affected participants' interpretations of <b>crying</b> by men and women. In employment contexts, participants perceived <b>crying</b> men as more emotional and sad than <b>crying</b> women as well as less competent. The emotionality inferences mediated the judgments of differing male and female competence. In relationship contexts, interpretations of <b>crying</b> women and men did not differ...|$|R

40|$|Despite being a {{universal}} human attachment behavior, {{little is known}} about individual differences in <b>crying.</b> To facilitate such examination we first recommend shortened versions of the attitudes and proneness sections of the Adult <b>Crying</b> Inventory using two independent samples. Importantly, we examine attachment orientation differences in <b>crying</b> proneness and test the mediating role of attitudes toward <b>crying</b> in this relationship. Participants (Sample 1 N = 623, Sample 2 N = 781), completed online measures of adult attachment dimensions (avoidance and anxiety), attitudes toward <b>crying,</b> and <b>crying</b> proneness. Exploratory factor analyses in Sample 1 revealed four factors for <b>crying</b> attitudes: <b>crying</b> helps one feel better; <b>crying</b> is healthy; hatred of crying; and <b>crying</b> is controllable; and three factors for <b>crying</b> proneness: threat to self; sadness; and joy. Confirmatory factor analyses in Sample 2 replicated these structures. Theoretically and statistically justified short forms of each scale were created. Multiple mediation analyses revealed similar patterns of results across the two samples, with the attitudes “crying is healthy” and “crying is controllable” consistently mediating the positive links between attachment anxiety and <b>crying</b> proneness, and the negative links between attachment avoidance and <b>crying</b> proneness. Results are discussed in relation to attachment and emotion regulation literature...|$|R

50|$|It {{can be very}} {{difficult}} to observe biological effects of <b>crying,</b> especially considering many psychologists believe the environment in which a person <b>cries</b> can alter the experience of the <b>crier.</b> However, <b>crying</b> studies in laboratories have shown several physical effects of <b>crying,</b> such as increased heart rate, sweating, and slowed breathing.
