40|$|The {{problem of}} a point vortex and N fixed {{cylinders}} in a two-dimensional inviscid fluid is studied and an analytical-numerical solution {{in the form of}} an infinite power series for the velocity field is obtained using complex analysis. The velocity distribution for the case of two cylinders is compared with the existing results of the {{problem of a}} vortex in an annular region which is conformally mapped onto the exterior of two cylinders. Limiting cases of N cylinders and the vortex, being far away from each other are studied. In these cases, "the dipole approximation" or "the point-island approximation" is derived, and its region of validity is established by numerical tests. The velocity distribution for a geometry of four cylinders placed at the vertices of a square and a vortex is presented. The problem of vortex motion with N <b>cylinders</b> <b>addressed</b> in the paper attracted attention recently owing to its importance in many applications. However, existing solutions using Abelian function theory are sophisticated and the theory is not one of the standard techniques used by applied mathematicians and engineers. Moreover, in the N ≥ 3 cylinder problem, the infinite product involved in the presentation of the Schottky-Klein prime function must also be truncated. So, the approach used in the paper is simple and an alternative to existing methods. This is the main motivation for this study...|$|R

It is well-known that absolute {{frequency band}} gaps are difficultly obtained {{in a band}} structure consisted of low-acoustic-impedance cylinders in high-acoustic-impedance host materials such as PMMA/Ni band structures. Phononic band structures with hollow cylinders are analyzed and discussed to obtain large full frequency band gaps not only for bulk modes but also for surface modes. The tendency of absolute frequency band gaps of surface and bulk acoustic waves is also addressed by changing the inner radius of hollow cylinders in this paper.

40|$|We {{consider}} a general double pulsed field gradient experiment with arbitrary experimental parameters and calculate an exact expression for the NMR signal attenuation from restricted geometries, which is valid at long wavelengths, i. e., when {{the product of}} the gyromagnetic ratio of the spins, the pulsed gradients’ duration, and their magnitude is small compared to the reciprocal of the pore size. It is possible to observe microscopic anisotropy within the pore space induced by the boundaries of the pore, which can be used to differentiate restricted from free or multicompartmental diffusion and to estimate a characteristic pore dimension in the former case. Explicit solutions for diffusion taking place between parallel plates as well as in cylindrical and spherical pores are provided. In coherently packed cylindrical pores, it is possible to measure simultaneously the cylinders’ orientation and diameter using small gradient strengths.

40|$|Diffusion MRI {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a non-invasive technique for axonal diameter mapping. However, accurate estimation of small diameters requires strong gradients, which is a challenge for the transition of the technique from preclinical to clinical MRI scanners, since these have weaker gradients. In this work, we develop a framework to estimate the lower bound for accurate diameter estimation, which we {{refer to as the}} resolution limit. We analyse only the contribution from the intra-axonal space and assume that axons can be represented by impermeable <b>cylinders.</b> To <b>address</b> the growing interest in using techniques for diffusion encoding that go beyond the conventional single diffusion encoding (SDE) sequence, we present a generalised analysis capable of predicting the resolution limit regardless of the gradient waveform. Using this framework, waveforms were optimised to minimise the resolution limit. The results show that, for parallel cylinders, the SDE experiment is optimal in terms of yielding the lowest possible resolution limit. In the presence of orientation dispersion, diffusion encoding sequences with square-wave oscillating gradients were optimal. The resolution limit for standard clinical MRI scanners (maximum gradient strength 60 - 80 mT/m) was found to be between 4 and 8 μm, depending on the noise levels and the level of orientation dispersion. For scanners with a maximum gradient strength of 300 mT/m, the limit was reduced to between 2 and 5 μm...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{instability}} of a fluid inside a precessing <b>cylinder</b> is <b>addressed</b> theore-tically and experimentally. The precessional motion forces Kelvin modes in the cylinder which can become resonant for given precessional frequencies and cylinder aspect ratios. When the Reynolds number is large enough, these forced resonant Kelvin modes even-tually become unstable. A linear stability analysis based on a triadic resonance between a forced Kelvin mode and two additional free Kelvin modes is carried out. This ana-lysis allows to predict the spatial structure of {{the instability}} and its threshold. These predictions are compared to the vorticity field measured by Particle Image Velocimetry with an excellent agreement. When the Reynolds number is further increased, nonlinear effects appear. A weakly nonlinear theory is developed semi-empirically by introducing a geostrophic mode which is triggered by the nonlinear interaction of a free Kelvin mode with itself {{in the presence of}} viscosity. Amplitude equations are obtained coupling the forced Kelvin mode, the two free Kelvin modes and the geostrophic mode. They show that the instability saturates to a fixed point just above threshold. Increasing the Rey-nolds number leads to a transition from a steady saturated regime to an intermittent flow in good agreement with experiments. Surprisingly, this weakly nonlinear model still gives a correct estimate of the mean flow inside the cylinder even far from the threshold when the flow is turbulent. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to investigate the challenges encountered in Scale-Resolving Simulations (SRS's) of turbulent wake flows driven by spatially-developing coherent structures. SRS's of practical interest are expressly intended for efficiently computing such flows by resolving only the most important features of the coherent structures and modelling the remainder as stochastic field. The success of SRS methods depends upon three important factors: i) ability to identify key flow mechanisms responsible for the generation of coherent structures; ii) determine the optimum range of resolution required to adequately capture key elements of coherent structures; and iii) ensure that the modelled part is comprised nearly exclusively of fully-developed stochastic turbulence. This study considers the canonical case of the flow around a circular <b>cylinder</b> to <b>address</b> these three key issues. It is first demonstrated using experimental evidence that the vortex-shedding instability and flow-structure development involves four important stages. A series of SRS computations of progressively increasing resolution are performed. An a priori basis for locating {{the origin of the}} coherent structures development is proposed and examined. The criterion is {{based on the fact that}} the coherent structures are generated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability. The most important finding is that the key aspects of coherent structures can be resolved only if the effective computational Reynolds number exceeds the critical value of the KH instability in laminar flows. Finally, a quantitative criterion assessing the nature of the unresolved field based on the strain-rate ratio of mean and unresolved fields is examined. The two proposed conditions and underlying rationale offer a quantitative basis for develop "good practice" guidelines for SRS of complex turbulent wake flows with coherent structures...|$|R
40|$|In this article, the multipolar vortex {{instability}} {{of the flow}} in a finite <b>cylinder</b> is <b>addressed.</b> The experimental study uses a rotating elastic deformable tube filled with water which is elliptically or triangularly deformed by two or three rollers. The experimental control parameters are the cylinder aspect ratio and the Reynolds number based on the angular frequency. For Reynolds numbers close to threshold, different instability modes are visualized using anisotropic particles, according {{to the value of}} the aspect ratio. These modes are compared with those predicted by an asymptotic stability theory in the limit of small deformations and large Reynolds numbers. A very good agreement is obtained which confirms the instability mechanism: for both elliptic and triangular configurations, the instability is due to the resonance of two normal modes (Kelvin modes) of the underlying rotating flow with the deformation field. At least four different elliptic instability modes, including combinations of Kelvin modes with azimuthal wavenumbers $m= 0 $ and $m= 2 $ and Kelvin modes $m= 1 $ and $m= 3 $ are visualised. Two different triangular instability modes which are combination of Kelvin modes $m=- 1 $ and $m= 2 $ and combination of Kelvin modes $m= 0 $ and $m= 3 $ are also evidenced. The nonlinear dynamics of a particular elliptic instability mode, which corresponds to the combination of two stationary Kelvin modes $m=- 1 $ and $m= 1 $, is examined in more detail using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The dynamics of the phase and amplitude of the instability mode is shown to be well-predicted by the weakly nonlinear analysis for moderate Reynolds numbers. For larger Reynolds number, a secondary instability is observed. Below a Reynolds number threshold, the amplitude of this instability mode saturates and its frequency is shown to agree with the predictions of Kerswell (1999). Above this threshold, a more complex dynamics develops which is only sustained during a finite time. The flow then relaminarises and the destabilisation process starts again...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{a range of}} phenomena associated with dry frictional contacts. Particular emphasis is devoted to elastic dissimilarity. Problems are formulated such that coupling between normal and tangential tractions is permitted and the results, which must often be found by numerical means, are compared with classical solutions. The manipulation of objects in contact with frictional surfaces is investigated. The main focus is on objects resting upon a plane at three discrete points of support. When displaced by an arbitrary force such objects {{have a tendency to}} rotate about these points of support. The motion of both planar and three dimensional objects is predicted and the effect of friction at the pushing contact is considered. Rolling contact between two elastically dissimilar <b>cylinders</b> is <b>addressed.</b> By allowing full coupling between normal and tangential tractions it is found that an offset in the contact patch may result. This often leads to a significant resistive moment which balances the nett power supplied and the frictional losses. Three dimensional contacts form {{a major part of the}} study and a numerical method is developed to facilitate their solution. The evolution of an incomplete contact is evaluated to demonstrate how contact boundaries may be determined. The method is then applied to sliding contact between elastically dissimilar spheres. The traction distributions which result from a fully coupled formulation are compared with those predicted by a Hertzian solution. The parameters which cause the greatest differences are found. A Mindlin-type contact is re-evaluated and traction distributions are calculated which are compatible with local slip directions for both elastically similar and dissimilar bodies. A comprehensive set of results is presented revealing how material parameters influence the solution. Interactions between cracks and contacts are analyzed. It is shown that although the change in compliance of a flawed body may modify the traction distribution compared with a flawless one, the stress intensity factors at the crack tip are rarely affected. </p Finally, a method of determining the fracture toughness of brittle materials is explored based on the observation of surface cracks in the wake of a sliding indenter. Material characteristics are related to crack initiation, spacing and depth. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{detection}} {{and location of}} a small flaw inside a conducting cylinder using an eddy current coil coaxial with the <b>cylinder</b> has been <b>addressed.</b> The electric field at an arbitrary axial and radial position inside the conductor has been obtained from a previous solution of the boundary value problem. An expres-sion for the change in complex impendance due to a small flaw located within a conducting body has been derived and is {{shown to be a}} func-tion of the electric field at the position of the flaw. For the case of a degenerate point flaw this expression is further simplified by using just the value of the electric field at the position of the centroid of the flaw. The overall impendance is shown to be a func-tion of the ratio of the radii of the loop and cylinder and of the conductivity of the material. The expression for the change in com-plex impedance has been bactored into two terms, one dependent on the acial location of the flaw, and the other on the depth of the flaw. The axial location of the flaw is seen to affect only the magnitude of the change in impedance; whereas the depth of the flaw is seen to affect both the magnitude and phase of the change in impedance. Plots of the complex change in impedance {{as a function of the}} axial loca-tion and depth of the flaw have been provided to illustrate its func-tional dependence on these parameters. I...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. The aim of {{this thesis}} is to study the {{stabilising}} effect which vertical ribs may have on a tall cylindrical structure, with {{the focus on the}} proposed Solar Chimney. The report begins with a brief introduction to the Solar Chimney concept. A study is made of flow regimes which exist for flow around a circular cylinder and these flow regimes, together with their characteristics, are described. Various threats to the Solar Chimney are identified and will be investigated. The natural shape and strength of the Saguaro Cactus leads to the investigation of vertically ribbed cylinders. Experimental wind tunnel tests are performed in Tokyo, Japan to obtain external pressure distributions. A smooth cylindrical model, as well as two different configurations of vertically ribbed cylinders are tested. These external pressure distributions are numerically integrated in order to obtain calculated drag coefficient values for the cylinders. The drag coefficients for a smooth cylinder and cylinders with vertical ribs are obtained experimentally by means of total drag force measurements. These tests were performed in the wind tunnel at the University of Stellenbosch. The effect of aspect ratio of a smooth <b>cylinder</b> is also <b>addressed.</b> Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses are carried out using the CFD software program, FLUENT. Both the drag coefficient and the external pressure distributions were investigated in this way. The differences between theoretical conditions and those of real life conditions of a smooth cylinder are discussed. The report ends by concluding the stabilising effect of vertical ribs on tall cylindrical structures and how these ribs may eliminate some of the present threats to the proposed Solar Chimney...|$|R
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of combustion phasing and combustion descriptors to ignition timing, load and mixture quality on fuelling a multi-cylinder {{natural gas engine}} with bio-derived H- 2 and CO rich syngas is addressed. While the descriptors for conventional fuels are well established and are in use for closed loop engine control, presence of H- 2 in syngas potentially alters the mixture properties and hence combustion phasing, necessitating the current study. The ability of the descriptors to predict abnormal combustion, hitherto missing in the literature, is also addressed. Results from experiments using multi-cylinder engines and numerical studies using zero dimensional Wiebe function based simulation models are reported. For syngas with 20 % H- 2 and CO and 2 % CH 4 (producer gas), an ignition retard of 5 +/- 1 degrees was required compared to natural gas ignition timing to achieve peak load of 72. 8 kWe. It is found that, for syngas, whose flammability limits are 0. 42 - 1. 93, the optimal engine operation was at an equivalence ratio of 1. 12. The same methodology is extended to a two <b>cylinder</b> engine towards <b>addressing</b> the influence of syngas composition, especially H- 2 fraction (varying from 13 % to 37 %), on the combustion phasing. The study confirms the utility of pressure trace derived combustion descriptors, except for the pressure trace first derivative, in describing the MBT operating condition of the engine when fuelled with an alternative fuel. Both experiments and analysis suggest most of the combustion descriptors to be independent of the engine load and mixture quality. A near linear relationship with ignition angle is observed. The general trend(s) of the combustion descriptors for syngas fuelled operation {{are similar to those}} of conventional fuels; the differences in {{sensitivity of}} the descriptors for syngas fuelled engine operation requires re-calibration of control logic for MBT conditions.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the CFD analysis, the arrangement {{and the first}} experimental results of a single-cylinder engine that employs an innovative low-pressure hydrogen directinjection system, characterised by low fuel rail pressure (12 bar) and consequent low residual storage pressure. The injection is split in two steps: at first hydrogen is metered and admitted into a small intermediate chamber by an electroinjector (a conventional one usually employed for CNG), next a mechanically-actuated poppet valve, that allows high volumetric flow rates, times hydrogen injection from the intermediate chamber to the cylinder within a short time, despite the high hydrogen volume due to the low injection pressure. Injection must be properly timed to maintain pressure below 6 bar (or little more) in the intermediate chamber and thus keep sonic flow through the electroinjector, to maximize volumetric efficiency and to avoid backfire in the intake pipe. A preliminary CFD study based on code KIVA 3 v {{was carried out in}} order to compare the behaviour of different injection valve and valve-seat geometries in controlling air-fuel mixing inside the <b>cylinder</b> and to <b>address</b> the choice towards the most suitable ones, i. e. those that allow adequate fuel distribution in the combustion chamber at ignition time for every operating condition. As well, all the modifications necessary to obtain the prototype engine from a production one were based on KIVA 3 v predictions, especially as regards the volume of the intermediate chamber and diameter, maximum lift and opening duration of the injection valve. The prototype derives from the single-cylinder Aprilia-Rotax 650 cm 3 with five valves (three intake and two exhaust). The cylinder head underwent deep changes to replace the central inlet valve and pipe with the ones for hydrogen injection. Special attention was paid to crankcase ventilation system to prevent the formation of hydrogen pockets. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the solution. The engine proved to run correctly, without the typical drawbacks of hydrogen engines (preignition, knocking, backfire, roughness) even with stoichiometric or slightly rich mixture (for maximum power). Maximum power was higher than for the engine fed with gasoline.
