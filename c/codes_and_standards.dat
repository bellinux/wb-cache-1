The ethical code here is the unified international ethical <b>code</b> <b>and</b> <b>standards</b> for IS-professionals as proposed by Effy Oz (1992). An ethical <b>code</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> is the rules for morally correct behavior that a community or organization put forth to its members, serving as norms and guidelines for their interactions and relationships. The underlying ethical principles are represented by such moral philosophers as Aristotle, Plato, Kant, Hegel, Hume, and Mill.

Changes made to {{the building}} to comply with modern building <b>codes</b> <b>and</b> <b>standards</b> also had to be easily distinguishable from the original. Among the restoration work required by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office was a large painted sign on the western facade of the building, which overlooks downtown Kent. It was painted in the same location as the previous versions of the sign, which had been visible, though no longer maintained, up until the bricks were cleaned during the building's renovation in 2012.|$|E

2500|$|ASME {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} standards-developing {{organizations}} in America. It produces approximately 600 <b>codes</b> <b>and</b> <b>standards</b> covering many technical areas, such as fasteners, plumbing fixtures, elevators, pipelines, and power plant systems and components. [...] ASME's standards are developed by committees of subject matter experts using an open, consensus-based process. [...] Many ASME standards are cited by government agencies as tools to meet their regulatory objectives. [...] ASME standards are therefore voluntary, unless the standards have been incorporated into a legally binding business contract or incorporated into regulations enforced by an authority having jurisdiction, such as a federal, state, or local government agency. [...] ASME's standards are used in more than 100 countries and have been translated into numerous languages.|$|E
2500|$|Cooling towers {{constructed}} {{in whole or}} in part of combustible materials can support internal fire propagation. Such fires can become very intense, due to the high surface-volume ratio of the towers, and fires can be further intensified by natural convection or fan-assisted draft. [...] The resulting damage can be sufficiently severe to require the replacement of the entire cell or tower structure. For this reason, some <b>codes</b> <b>and</b> <b>standards</b> recommend that combustible cooling towers be provided with an automatic fire sprinkler system. Fires can propagate internally within the tower structure when the cell is not in operation (such as for maintenance or construction), and even while the tower is in operation, especially those of the induced-draft type, because of the existence of relatively dry areas within the towers.|$|E
