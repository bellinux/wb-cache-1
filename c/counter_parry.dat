50|$|The parry riposte {{uses the}} {{strength}} of one's own blade to avoid the opponent's. After performing it, the fencer then counters the attack with a combined attack which would force the opponent to parry, allow you to <b>counter</b> <b>parry</b> the opponent's blade, and allow you to penetrate their next parry to win.|$|E
50|$|Composed of one move (a thrust, lunge or fleche), {{the simple}} attack is {{normally}} countered with a parry riposte, parrying (blocking or pushing aside) the opponent's blade and then attacking with this tactic. It {{can also be}} countered with a thrust in some situations. They are most effective when {{the distance between the}} fencers is small enough that the opponent cannot execute a parry riposte. Often fencers will try to close distance before mounting a simple attack to use this to their advantage. Sometimes, a fencer will make a simple attack and when the opponent parries, the fencer can then make a <b>counter</b> <b>parry</b> and riposte.|$|E
5000|$|Key game system {{improvements}} {{include an}} easier [...] "step" [...] and [...] "avoid" [...] systems, arena walls (rather than ring-out ability on all sides) and wall-specific moves, a three-step Soul Charge system, a clash {{system that is}} used when two attacks would hit each other resulting in a white flash, Guard Break attacks which put a blocking player into a post guard-impact state, just frame moves awarding additional hits to players who could time their command inputs well, and a revised Guard Impact system that removed height-based Impact moves and instead used a more unified system (high and mid attacks are countered using Repels, mid and low attacks are <b>countered</b> using <b>Parries).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Among the Betawi {{people of}} Greater Jakarta, the pencak silat {{tradition}} {{is rooted in}} the culture of the jagoan or jawara, local champions seen as heroes of the common people. They went against colonial authority and were despised by the Dutch as thugs and bandits. Silat Betawi is referred to in the local dialect as maen pukulan or main pukulan, literally meaning [...] "strike-play". The most well-known schools are Cingkrik, Kwitang, and Beksi. The acrobatic monkey-inspired Cingkrik is likely the oldest, the name implying agile movement. The art is said to trace back to a monkey style of kuntao attributed to Rama Isruna after his wife observed the actions of monkeys. A student of this kuntao named Ki Maing later expanded on the system after a monkey stole his walking stick. Cingkrik is highly evasive; blows are delivered as a <b>counter</b> after <b>parrying</b> or blocking, and usually target the face, throat and groin. Attacks mimic the grabbing and tearing actions of monkeys. Kwitang also employs evasion and some open-hand strikes but its focus is on powerful punches with the fist tightly-closed at the moment of impact, mainly targeting the centreline. Force is concentrated into the knuckles of the little and ring finger. Attacks are made with a curved arm; the elbow is never fully extended so as to prevent being caught in a joint lock. Beksi, meaning [...] "defense of four directions", is credited to a man named Lie Ceng Ok. It is distinguishable from other Betawi systems by its close-distance combat style and lack of offensive leg action. Silat Betawi includes all the classical pencak silat weapons, but places particular emphasis on the parang (machete), golok (chopper), toya (staff), and pisau (knife). Kwitang practitioners are said to be the best chabang fighters in Indonesia.|$|R
