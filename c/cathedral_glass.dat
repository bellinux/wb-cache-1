5|$|St. Andrew's Church is an {{actively}} used Anglican Church. The {{building is}} made from stuccoed brick with a crenelated tower and sits on —that includes a cemetery and a rectory—abutting the Liffey River. The building was begun in 1843 by Thomas Reibey as a school for the town. He had the building converted to a church in 1845; Reibey donated the church's land and funded {{the building of the}} rectory and later purchase of the church's organ. The cemetery was consecrated in April 1845 and the church itself in November of the same year. The current structure was not complete until the tower was added in 1863. St. Andrew's was renovated c1900, the roof surface was replaced and new <b>Cathedral</b> <b>glass</b> installed.|$|E
2500|$|Architectural {{elements}} {{outlined by}} Conrad {{to achieve this}} goal included: brick construction over timber, with bare treatments to interior walls; large windows {{at the rear of the}} church and side windows on the chancel (rather than behind the altar); low-toned <b>cathedral</b> <b>glass</b> in simple leaded design where stained glass was not affordable, naves that were long rather than wide, and internal roofing wholly of wood, with heavy timber for open trussed roofs, stained with a dull finish to create [...] "an interesting and dignified treatment". Such elements are readily apparent at St Paul's and other churches of the 1920s designed by Atkinson and Conrad. In particular, the use of substantial timber roof trussing in the nave (a word derived from the Latin word navis for ship), resembling the interior of a ship's hull, expressed the longstanding symbolism of the church as a ship, guiding its members to safe harbour.|$|E
2500|$|This is a Grade II listed {{building}} on Huddersfield Road, Mirfield, West Yorkshire. It {{was designed by}} Barber at a building cost of £8,000 and consecrated on Tuesday 1 November 1881 by Bishop Ryan. The foundation stone was laid on 25 January 1881 by Edward Theodore Ingham, JP, of Blake Hall, in memory of Rev. Ralph Maude, a previous vicar of Mirfield. The ground plan {{was designed as a}} [...] by [...] parallelogram in the interior. The interior nave was designed to be [...] wide, and the chancel [...] wide. The pillars of the nave and chancel together formed seven bays, and those columns are Dalbeattie granite monoliths from the quarries of Shearer, Field & Co. The interior walls are faced with local polished ashlar wallstones. There is a porch on the south side, and a doorway on the north side through the tower. Originally this north doorway had an [...] "ornamental carved and moulded oak screen with tracery headed panels filled with <b>cathedral</b> <b>glass</b> with lead cameo." ...|$|E

2500|$|It had wide {{entrance}} doors: three {{doors with}} moulded panels, patent floor springs and brass fingerplates, and swing {{windows in the}} top panels.

There was [...] tongue and groove wood flooring laid on [...] by [...] joists, and a brown glazed brick skirting, a dado and salmon–coloured walls. Today as in 1904 the ceiling appears panelled, being broken up by girders supporting the roof, and supported by [...] "ornamental iron columns with moulded bases and capitals;" [...] the form of the ceiling lantern remains, but is unventilated. The walls still have the original pilasters with capitals to match the central columns. In 1904 the hall had a [...] high platform stage with moulded panels and corners. Above that was a Victoria stone memorial tablet saying: [...] "This pavilion was presented to the town of Herne Bay by Thomas Dence Esq., 1903. Architect F.W.J. Palmer C.E., surveyor to the Council.

60|$|And {{among other}} right and proper possessions, this Mr. Morris {{had a wife}} and children. They were the right sort of wife, and the right sort and number of children, of course; nothing imaginative or highty-flighty about any of them, so far as Mr. Morris could see; they wore {{perfectly}} correct clothing, neither smart nor hygienic nor faddy in any way, but just sensible; and {{they lived in a}} nice sensible house in the later Victorian sham Queen Anne style of architecture, with sham half-timbering of chocolate-painted plaster in the gables, Lincrusta Walton sham carved oak panels, a terrace of terra cotta to imitate stone, and <b>cathedral</b> <b>glass</b> in the front door. His boys went to good solid schools, and were put to respectable professions; his girls, in spite of a fantastic protest or so, were all married to suitable, steady, oldish young men with good prospects. And when it was a fit and proper thing for him to do so, Mr. Morris died. His tomb was of marble, and, without any art nonsense or laudatory inscription, quietly imposing--such being the fashion of his time.|$|E
