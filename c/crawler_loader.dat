50|$|The Major range {{continued}} into the 1970s but along with the Corgi Toys range suffered somewhat from the constraints on development budgets {{that the company was}} forced to make. The Mercedes-Benz Unimog and snowplough (1150) was released in February 1971 and another American cab unit was introduced in October 1971. The new Mack was coupled with a fuel tanker in the livery of 'Esso' (1152) in October 1971 and a Transcontinental trailer (1100) in November 1971, and fitted with an updated version of the Priestman Cub Shovel now converted to become a crane in October 1972 as the Mack Priestman Crane Truck (1154). A new Berliet cab was introduced in May 1974 as the Crane Fruehauf Discharge Dumper (1102), a large articulated aggregate carrier for use on construction sites, and the new cab was also used as the Berliet Wrecker Truck (1144) in March 1975 updating the aforementioned Holmes Wrecker, which had been in the range since 1967. The Pathfinder Airport Crash Truck (1103) released in September 1974 had won the Design Council Engineering Award for its manufacturer Chubb, and the Corgi miniature included an internal water tank allowing water to be squirted through die-cast water cannons by pumping a rubber bulb. Another new cab was introduced in April 1976. The Ford Transcontinental was designed for long range treks across the European continent and was first issued coupled to the fuel tanker previously seen with the earlier Mack cab, also in 'Esso' livery (1157) or 'Gulf' livery (1160), and later in February 1982 in the livery of 'Guinness' (1169). A new Car Transporter (1159) was issued in November 1976 using the new Ford Transcontinental cab, and two more construction site orientated vehicles were issued, the JCB <b>Crawler</b> <b>Loader</b> (1110) in June 1976 and the Volvo BM Concrete Mixer (1156) in January 1977. The Dolphinarium (1164) was issued in April 1980 and featured the Berliet cab and a flatbed trailer which carried a large plastic water tank. Once the tank was filled a plunger attached to a jet nozzle within the tank could be pumped forcing two model dolphins attached to a plastic guide to jump {{out of the water and}} through the air.|$|E
50|$|O&K {{expanded}} to build {{freight and passenger}} cars, and above all, excavators for construction. The company also built other heavy equipment, including graders, dump trucks, forklift trucks, compressors, <b>crawler</b> <b>loaders,</b> wheeled loaders, road rollers, and truck cranes.|$|R
50|$|Takeuchi Mfg. Co., Ltd. (Kabushiki-gaisha Takeuchi Seisakujo) is Japanese heavy {{machinery}} company whose products include mini excavators, hydraulic excavators and <b>crawler</b> <b>loaders.</b> In 1971 Takeuchi introduced the first compact excavator. The company has wholly owned subsidiary {{facilities in the}} United States (1979), United Kingdom (1996), France (2000) and China (2006).|$|R

50|$|New Holland {{produces}} thirteen product families, five in {{the heavy}} range and eight in the light range; products include dozers, miniexcavators, graders, wheel <b>loaders,</b> <b>crawler</b> excavators, backhoe <b>loaders,</b> skid steer loaders.|$|R
50|$|With the {{expansion}} of mechanisation, some agricultural machines also began {{to be used in}} the construction industry. The 70C, 80C, 90C and 100C models, used for ploughing, received just a few structural changes to become the AD3, AD4, AD5, AD6, AD7, AD9, AD1O, AD12, AD14, AD18 and AD20 <b>crawler</b> <b>loaders.</b> In 1974, Fiat joined forces with the American Allis-Chalmers company to create Fiat-Allis to manufacture a line of crawler machines produced in Brazil, United States and Italy, wheel backhoe-loaders (United States and United Kingdom), excavators (Italy and Brazil), graders and dozers (United States).|$|R
50|$|Some heavy {{equipment}} {{may also be}} propelled by a hydrostatic transmission; e.g. agricultural machinery including foragers, combines, and some tractors. A variety of heavy earth-moving equipment, e.g. compact and small wheel loaders, track type <b>loaders</b> and <b>crawler</b> tractors, skid-steered <b>loaders</b> and asphalt compactors use hydrostatic transmission. Hydrostatic CVTs are usually not used for extended duration high torque applications because of the heat that is generated by the flowing oil, although {{there are a variety}} of oil cooler designs to help counter this problem.|$|R
40|$|The {{status and}} {{development}} tendency of construction machinery in china {{in recent years}} will be introduced; especially the outputs and performance level of the main products such as excavator, <b>loader,</b> <b>crawler</b> crane, truck crane, road roller and rotary drilling rig. Then the application of new products from internal corporation is analyzed and {{the research and development}} tendency of homemade hydraulic components of construction machinery field are also included. This paper introduces not only the national product standards of construction machinery but also the national policies and regulations for energy saving and pollution reduction in China...|$|R
