The present study has two areas of focus: (1) {{the effects of}} aquatic microorganisms on corrosion, and (2) the surface-cleaning step in the <b>conversion</b> <b>coating</b> process. ^ Microorganisms and biofilms on solid surface can be found almost in any natural aqueous environments. So far, microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC), or biocorrosion, has been poorly understood. A comparative study on the corrosion of aluminum alloy 2024 -T 3 was conducted in either plain seawater or nutrient-rich ZoBell 2216 medium, and {{with or without the}} marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas atlantica by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Results indicated that the presence of P. atlantica in seawater decreased the corrosion rate of aluminum alloy 2024 -T 3.

Examination of attached P. atlantica on the surface of aluminum alloy 2024 -T 3, in different media, suggested that, in low nutrient-concentration environments, more bacteria adhered to the solid surface; in high nutrient-concentration environments, bacterial cells tended to distribute in the aqueous media. ^ Health and environmental concerns call for the development of a non-toxic <b>conversion</b> <b>coating</b> with comparable corrosion protection and paint adhesion properties, to replace excellent <b>chromate</b> <b>conversion</b> coatings on aluminum alloys, due to the toxicity of <b>chromates.</b> A titanate <b>conversion</b> <b>coating</b> has been already developed towards this end; the main focus of this study was on improving the surface-cleaning step that precedes coating.

""A Dissertation Presented to the Faculty of the Graduate School at the University of Missouri [...] Columbia In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy. "Dissertation adviser: Dr. Qingsong Yu. Includes vita. This {{dissertation}} {{reports the}} research results obtained in investigating low pressure plasma coatings for corrosion protection of aluminum ion vapor deposition (IVD) coated high-strength steels and in studying atmospheric non-thermal plasmas for destruction of oral bacteria. The objective of investigating plasma coatings for protection of IVD coated {{high strength steel}} is to reduce damage from corrosion and prevent its hydrogen re-embrittlement that often occurs in aircraft. In this study, we completed the design and construction of a hybrid IVD/plasma coater, which has the capability of producing both aluminum IVD coatings and plasma coatings of trimethylsilane (TMS). Both IVD Al coating and TMS plasma coatings were successfully prepared by the hybrid coater. The coating properties of the resulted IVD coating and TMS plasma coating were characterized and evaluated. Corrosion property evaluation using potentiodynamic polarization technique indicated that TMS plasma coated IVD specimens showed {{a decrease in the}} magnitude of corrosion potential and a decrease in corrosion current compared to bare IVD, and thus better corrosion resistance. Corrosion test results from SO 2 salt spray test showed that a similar amount of corrosion products were found with the plasma coated IVD specimens as their controls, i. e., <b>chromate</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>coated</b> IVD samples, and did not form visible amounts of red rust after 504 hours neutral salt fog. Hydrogen re-embrittlement testing demonstrated that TMS plasma coated IVD specimens gave better test results as compared with bare IVD samples. This result is believed to be due to the improved corrosion resistance of the TMS plasma coated IVD specimens and thus less amount of hydrogen formation as a corrosion by product. It was further found that IVD Al coating should be exposed to oxygen or air in order to create an oxide layer before organosilane coatings are applied for stronger corrosion resistance. TMS plasma coating did not cause contamination to IVD. Likewise, the application of IVD inIncludes bibliographical references...|$|R

In AA 7075, there was only a slight difference in corrosion resistance between the two tempers.

The difference in the corrosion resistance between the T 6 and T 7 tempers in the coated and uncoated conditions is about the same suggesting that the origin of any “temper effect ” in <b>conversion</b> <b>coated</b> materials is ultimately due to the intrinsic change in corrosion susceptibility of the alloy itself.

50|$|<b>Chromate</b> <b>{{conversion}}</b> <b>coating</b> {{is a type}} {{of conversion}} coating used to passivate steel, aluminum, zinc, cadmium, copper, silver, magnesium, and tin alloys. It is primarily used as a corrosion inhibitor, primer, decorative finish, or to retain electrical conductivity. The process is named after the chromate found in chromic acid, also known as hexavalent chromium, the chemical most widely used in the immersion bath process whereby the coating is applied. However, hexavalent chromium is toxic, thus, highly regulated, so new, non-hexavalent chromium-based processes are becoming more readily available at a commercial level. One alternative contains trivalent chromium. In Europe the RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) Directive is commonly referred to regarding elimination of hexavalent chromium in electrical and electronic equipment, and the REACH ("Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals") Directive to wider applications including <b>chromate</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>coating</b> processes, paint primers and other preparations.|$|E

The most significant environmental factor contributing to the corrosion of these alloys is water condensed from humid air and contaminated with soluble chloride salts. The Al 2024 series used for aircraft are particularly susceptible to corrosion in aqueous chloride solutions due to alloying constituents such as copper and other impurities. ^ Chromates are efficient inhibitors of corrosion of aluminum in near neutral aqueous environments containing aggressive anions such as chlorides. Usually, aluminum alloys are initially protected by <b>chromate</b> <b>conversion</b> coatings. Additional polymer coatings are sometimes added during exposure to corrosive atmospheres such as marine environments. ^ Although chromate coatings are widely used, they {{require the use of}} noxious solutions, so they have always presented effluent disposal problems. There are health and safety concerns over the use of chromates due to their toxicity and carcinogenic nature and, as a consequence, the environmental and health risks {{associated with the use of}} such coatings will be restricted in the future.
