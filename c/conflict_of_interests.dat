5|$|Like other {{forensic}} fields, forensic anthropologists {{are held}} to {{a high level of}} ethical standards due to their work in the legal system. Individuals who purposefully misrepresent themselves or any piece of evidence can be sanctioned, fined, or imprisoned by the appropriate authorities depending on the severity of the violation. Individuals who fail to disclose any <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> or who fail to report all of their findings, regardless of what they may be, can face disciplinary actions. It is important that forensic anthropologists remain impartial during the course of an investigation. Any perceived bias during an investigation could hamper efforts in court to bring the responsible parties to justice.|$|E

25|$|Douglas' {{administration}} also founded public elementary schools, worked to control {{alcohol in the}} colony, and constructed the Victoria District Church (forerunner to the Christ Church Cathedral). In 1856, as ordered by the British Government, Douglas reluctantly established an elected Legislative Assembly.

25|$|After trials, {{this gun}} was {{declared}} {{to be superior}} to all its rivals. Armstrong surrendered the patent for the gun to the British government, rather than profit from its design. As a result he was created a Knight Bachelor and in 1859 was presented to Queen Victoria. Armstrong became employed as Engineer of Rifled Ordnance to the War Department. In order to avoid a <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> if his own company were to manufacture armaments, Armstrong created a separate company, called Elswick Ordnance Company, {{in which he had}} no financial involvement. The new company agreed to manufacture armaments for the British government and no other.

25|$|Burley {{was also}} ordered to {{investigate}} complex and important matters {{of property and}} inheritance, and these too could have a bearing on the king's interests or public order. On 18 November 1400 he was sent with Lee, Holbache and Sir John Wiltshire, {{a close friend of}} Arundel, to investigate a case where it was suspected a dead man's property was being concealed from the king, a form of tax evasion. The following month Burley and Darras were among those sent in pursuit of Sir Thomas and Richard Harcourt. On the death of Sir William Shareshull, a furious dispute had broken out over his estates in Shropshire and Straffordshire, which he had inherited from his wealthy grandfather, the eminent lawyer Justice William de Shareshull. To keep their grip on the estates, the Harcourts had forcibly prevented the escheator taking possession of them. In March 1404 Burley and John Kinghtley, another JP, were ordered to discover the whereabouts of Fulk, the son and heir of John Mawddwy and Elizabeth Corbet. The case was one in into which Burley must have had considerable insight, bordering on a <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests.</b> In 1390 nine Shropshire and Herefordshire landowners had been summoned to interview by the king and his council under pain of 200 marks each because of their violence in pursuit of a Corbet family property dispute. They included John Darras, Sir Sir Roger Corbet, the father of Burley's ward, Sir Richard Ludlow, Burleigh's former client, Sir Hugh Cheyne and Thomas Young, both MPs with him for Shropshire and the latter a close associate in Arundel's service. Whatever the outcome of this particular phase in the dispute, the Mawddwy estates ultimately passed to Hugh Burgh, Burley's associate as a feoffee for the Talbots, who married the missing heir's sister.|$|E

500|$|Mani Ratnam {{developed}} a script—originally written in English—into a film and named it Pallavi Anu Pallavi. His uncle Krishnamurthy agreed {{to produce the}} film but imposed a condition {{that it should be}} made under a limited budget in Kannada, to which he agreed. As a debutant, Mani Rahman {{wanted to make sure that}} the technical aspects of the film are good. He persuaded Balu Mahendra to do the cinematography as he found the latter's work to be very impressive. He managed to get other crew members B. Lenin (for editing), Thotta Tharani (for art direction) and Ilaiyaraaja (for music composer music), all leading craftsmen in their respective fields then. For the male lead, he cast Anil Kapoor after watching his performance in the Telugu film Vamsa Vruksham (1980). Lakshmi who was a leading actress then, was signed up as the female lead. The film explored the relationship between a young man and an older woman. Although an average grosser at the box-office, the film fetched Mani Ratnam the Best Screenplay Award from the Karnataka State Government for the year 1983. After watching Pallavi Anu Pallavi, N. G. John, a Malayalam film producer, offered him a chance to direct a film in Malayalam. Scripted by T. Damodaran, Unaru was about the corruption in labour unions of Kerala. The film was completed with in two months and got released in April 1984. Mani Ratnam attributed the failure of the film to the <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> that he and the producer had. Following this, he entered Tamil cinema when G. Thyagarajan of Sathya Jyothi Films offered him a chance to direct Pagal Nilavu (1985). The film had Murali and Revathi playing lead roles. It was different from his previous two films in a way that it included dance sequences and a [...] "comedy track". However, the film turned out to be another failure for him. The same year, he directed another Tamil film Idaya Kovil, a romantic drama. He remodeled a ready made script on the lines of Charlie Chaplin's Limelight (1952). Described by himself as an unsatisfied work, the film was a major box-office success. The phase between 1983 and 1986 was the toughest of his career with only Pallavi Anupallavi being a satisfiable film; the rest three were done with a lot of [...] "compromises".|$|E

However such coverage of the complaint in practice put under discussion {{the point of the}} complaint itself. The Freedom of the Press 2004 Global Survey, an annual study issued by the American organisation Freedom House, downgraded Italy's ranking from 'Free' to 'Partly Free' due to Berlusconi's influence over RAI, a ranking which, in [...] "Western Europe" [...] was shared only with Turkey (...) [...] Reporters Without Borders states that in 2004, [...] "The <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> involving Prime Minister Berlusconi and his vast media empire was still not resolved and continued to threaten news diversity". In April 2004, the International Federation of Journalists joined the criticism, objecting to the passage of a law vetoed by Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in 2003, which critics believe is designed to protect Berlusconi's reported 90% control of the Italian national media.|$|E

40|$|Although both {{financial}} and intrinsic <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> can exist throughout the drug develop-ment process, {{little is known}} about how advanced cancer patients enrolled onto early phase clinical trials perceive investigator <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests.</b> Patients and Methods We interviewed 102 advanced cancer patients enrolled onto phase I clinical trials using a standardized survey that addressed multiple issues related to <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and research participation. Results Fifty-five percent of patients would not be concerned if physicians involved in running a clinical trial had financial <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> whereas 65 % of patients would be concerned if physicians involved in running a trial had intrinsic <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> Most patients reported that potential <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> should be disclosed to patients on research trials (52 % for financial <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and 61 % for more intrinsic <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest).</b> Most patients would be willing to participate in trials after learning <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> information (63 %). Younger patients expressed more concern regarding financial <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> than older patients (odds ratio, 6. 22; 95 % CI, 1. 41 to 27. 24). Conclusion Patients with advanced cancer are equally, if not more, concerned about traditional intrinsic <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> as compared with financial <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> Patients generally believed that <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> information should be disclosed to research participants. The fact that younger patients expressed more concern about financial <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> may have the potential to influence clinical trial participation rates. The actual impact <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> disclosure to research subjects needs to be evaluated more carefully.
