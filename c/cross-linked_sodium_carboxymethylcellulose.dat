These agents were used alone, and in combinations, both 50 &#x 0025; intra-granularly, and 50 &#x 0025; extra-granularly. To cover all these variables in the formulations, seven different formulations were designed. Use of different disintegrating agents have shown varying effect on disintegration time and pattern. The disintegration time for formulation I and III did not comply with the official disintegration test in distilled water, {{as well as in}} simulated gastric fluid. All formulations, except formulation I and III, showed nearly equivalent to 30 min of Rosset-Rice time for neutralization. The graphical representation shows that when the base is available in full strength, it neutralizes the acid at a faster rate, and then the amount of base goes on reducing progressively, resulting in decrease in the rate of neutralization.

40|$|The {{wide variety}} of excipients {{available}} calls for evaluation of their functionality, in this case of the pharmaceutical performance of microcrystalline celluloses and <b>sodium</b> <b>cross-linked</b> <b>carboxymethylcelluloses</b> from different sources. This evaluation includes parameters such as powder flow, compactibility, ejection pressure and dissolution from fast-release tablets {{as well as from}} floating granules and controlled-release tablets. In a previous study, the excipient Carmacel® presented better disintegration properties compared to Croscarmellose®. However, the evaluation showed better compactibility performance for Croscarmellose®. These characteristics were observed using pure excipients. Nevertheless, these advantages have not been confirmed in tests employing immediate-release or modified-release formulations containing metronidazole. Regarding microcrystalline celluloses, the present comparative evaluation between pure Alfacel ® types 101 and 102 and pure Avicel® types 101 and 102 showed better compactibility performance for the latter. However, for metronidazole formulations, this advantage was not evident in the innovative excipient. Notwithstanding, this study revealed better compactibility performance of microcrystalline cellulose type 101. In terms of powder flow properties, Avicel® and Alfacel® showed similar performance. However, the results revealed better powder flow employing microcrystalline cellulose type 102 for both excipients. Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that the employment of innovative and generic excipients have both advantages and disadvantages. The observed differences however, tend to disappear as the excipients are diluted in a formulation, thereby equalizing their influence on product performance...|$|R

The rheological studies demonstrated that the end-product of the complexation of low viscous methacrylate copolymer and entangled solution of <b>sodium</b> <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> generated a polymer, which exhibited a solid-like behavior with a three-dimensional network. Additionally, the rheological profile of the <b>sodium</b> <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> and methacrylate copolymer with respect to the effect of various concentrations of acetic acid on the synthesis of the IPEC was elucidated using molecular mechanics energy relationships (MMER) by exploring the spatial disposition of carboxymethylcellulose and methacrylate copolymer with respect to each other and acetic acid.

Scanning electron microscopic images clearly showed the formation of interconnected pores, capillary channels, and the <b>cross-linked</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> molecules around the peripheries of pores. The prepared system floated and delivered the ranitidine hydrochloride for about 17 h. The release profile of ranitidine hydrochloride was studies by changing the retardant polymer in the system. To ascertain the drug release kinetics, the dissolution profiles were fitted to different mathematical models that include zero-order, first-order, Higuchi, Hixson-Crowell, Korsmeyer-Peppas, Weibull, and Hopfenberg models. The in vitro dissolution from system was explained by Korsmeyer-Peppas model. The diffusion exponent values in Korsmeyer-Peppas model range between 0. 48 ± 0. 01 and 0. 70 ± 0. 01, which appears to indicate an anomalous non-Fickian transport.

40|$|Anionic polymer <b>sodium</b> <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> (CELLOGEN® HP-HS and/or HP- 12 HS) was {{investigated}} {{for its ability}} to influence the release of three model drugs propranolol hydrochloride, theophylline and ibuprofen from polyethylene oxide (POLYOX™ WSR 1105 and/or Coagulant) hydrophilic matrices. For anionic ibuprofen and non-ionic theophylline, no unusual/unexpected release profiles were obtained from tablets containing a mixture of two polymers. However, for cationic propranolol HCl, a combination of polyethylene oxide (PEO) with <b>sodium</b> <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> (NaCMC) produced a significantly slower drug release compared to the matrices with single polymers. The potential use of this synergistic interaction can be a design of new extended release pharmaceutical dosage forms with a more prolonged release (beyond 12  h) using lower polymer amount, which could be particularly beneficial for freely water-soluble drugs, preferably for once daily oral administration. In order to explain changes in the obtained drug release profiles, Fourier transform infrared absorption spectroscopy was performed. A possible explanation for the more prolonged propranolol HCl release from matrices based on both PEO and NaCMC may be due to a chemical bond (i. e. ionic/electrostatic intermolecular interaction) between amine group of the cationic drug and carboxyl group of the anionic polymer, leading to a formation of a new type/form of the active (i. e. salt) with sustained release pattern...|$|R

For all studied APIs, a combination of polyethylene oxide with <b>sodium</b> <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> produced slower drug release compared to the matrices of single polymers. This behaviour was mainly attributed to the interaction of ester/carboxylic acid functionalities to yield H-bonding between the anionic polymer groups and the additionally protonated N-atoms of the active substances. X-ray photoelectron and isothermal titration calorimetry studies confirmed drug-polymer interaction and polymer-polymer interaction (i. e. the PEO binding with negatively charged NaCMC), whilst differential scanning calorimetry indicated the existence of both crystalline and molecularly dispersed active forms in the created complexes. The drug release mechanisms were fitted to various models suggesting diffusion control {{for the majority of}} the formulations. The Korsmeyer-Peppas model was found to be the most suitable for description of release profiles of all formulations.
