25|$|The Word Hoard, the {{collection}} of manuscripts that produced Naked Lunch, also produced parts of the later works The Soft Machine (1961), The Ticket That Exploded (1962), and Nova Express (1964). These novels feature extensive use of the <b>cut-up</b> technique that influenced all of Burroughs's subsequent fiction to a degree. During Burroughs's friendship and artistic collaborations with Brion Gysin and Ian Sommerville, the technique was combined with images, Gysin's paintings, and sound, via Somerville's tape recorders. Burroughs was so dedicated to the <b>cut-up</b> method that he often defended {{his use of the}} technique before editors and publishers, most notably Dick Seaver at Grove Press in the 1960s and Holt, Rinehart & Winston in the 1980s. The <b>cut-up</b> method, because of its random or mechanical basis for text generation, combined with the possibilities of mixing in text written by other writers, deemphasizes the traditional role of the writer as creator or originator of a string of words, while simultaneously exalting the importance of the writer's sensibility as an editor. In this sense, the <b>cut-up</b> method may be considered as analogous to the collage method in the visual arts. New restored editions of The Nova Trilogy (or <b>Cut-Up</b> Trilogy), edited by Oliver Harris and published in 2014, included notes and materials to reveal the care with which Burroughs used his methods and the complex histories of his manuscripts.|$|E
25|$|Burroughs {{himself was}} very displeased {{with the first}} edition {{and this was the}} main reason for {{rewriting}} it so thoroughly: in 1961 he wrote to his friend Allen Ginsberg that he rewrote it extensively while he was working on Dead Fingers Talk, mostly because he was displeased with the balance of <b>cut-up</b> and more linear material. However, his revised editions included much new <b>cut-up</b> material as well as more conventional prose.|$|E

25|$|During this period, P-Orridge befriended an English {{musician}} named David Bunting; P-Orridge {{already knew}} another man named David, so coined the moniker David Tibet, which Bunting adopted {{as a stage}} name. Through an introduction provided by Burroughs, P-Orridge met Brion Gysin in Paris, probably in 1980, coming to be deeply influenced by Gysin's <b>cut-up</b> method; P-Orridge understood {{this to be a}} revolutionary method of escaping current patterns of thought and developing something new.|$|E
25|$|William S. Burroughs (19141997) was {{the writer}} who finally brought science fiction {{together}} with the trends of postmodern literature. With the help of Jack Kerouac, Burroughs published Naked Lunch, {{the first of a}} series of novels employing a semi-dadaistic technique called the <b>Cut-up</b> and postmodern deconstructions of conventional society, pulling away the mask of normality to reveal nothingness beneath. Burroughs showed visions of society as a conspiracy of aliens, monsters, police states, drug dealers and alternate levels of reality. The linguistics of science fiction merged with the experiments of postmodernism in a beat generation gestalt.|$|E
25|$|Umlikaaq (or Umlikaq ~ Umlikqaq) or Ungllekaq (ungllik'ar in Nunivak Cup'ig) {{is fresh}} boiled fish. All {{parts of the}} fish except for the {{entrails}} are used to prepare umlikqaq. Fresh fish that have been dead {{for less than a}} day make the best umlikqaq because the meat is still firm. If a freshwater fish is caught with a hook, it is best to kill the fish by hitting its head soon after capture so the meat will stay firm for cooking. The main ingredients of umlikqaq are <b>cut-up</b> fish, water, and salt which are boiled for about 29 minutes. This is a preferred food for elders because it easy to make and is not strongly seasoned. First heads are good prepared as umlikqaq. Also, Ungelkaaq is fish steak cut transversely.|$|E

25|$|Smith is also {{responsible}} {{for the majority of}} the band's lyrics, which are written in a cryptic fractured form of English alternately hailed as poetic or nonsensical. He has generally refused to discuss their content, preferring to keep the words and their inspirations shrouded in mystique and allowing for fan interpretations. Smith has also sometimes employed a <b>cut-up</b> lyrical approach drawing on the works of (among others), William Blake, Charles Kingsley, William Shakespeare and T.S. Eliot. Two favourite cut-and-paste sources are Pedro Carolino’s English As She Is Spoke (a failed Victorian English-Portuguese phrasebook once hailed by Mark Twain as a perfect example of absurdity) and the nineteenth-century Irish poet George Darley. Fans have also spotted references to the films The Night of the Hunter and Eraserhead in Smith's words and music videos.|$|E
25|$|Industrial hip hop fuses {{the themes}} and {{aesthetics}} of industrial with hip hop music. Its origins {{are in the}} work of Mark Stewart and Adrian Sherwood. In 1985, Stewart, former Pop Group singer, released As the Veneer of Democracy Starts to Fade, applying the <b>cut-up</b> style of industrial music with the house band of Sugar Hill Records (Doug Wimbish, Keith Leblanc, and Skip McDonald). Sherwood was a major figure in British dub music, as well as working with industrial groups such as Cabaret Voltaire, Einstürzende Neubauten, Ministry, KMFDM, and Nine Inch Nails. Tackhead, a collaboration between Sherwood and the Sugar Hill band, picked up where Stewart left off. The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, from San Francisco, and Meat Beat Manifesto, from the UK, are also early representatives of the style. The later work of Broadrick's Godflesh, as well as his collaborations with Kevin Martin, Ice, and Techno Animal, are examples of industrial hip hop. Saul Williams, a slam poet, also performs in the style. Other notable contributors include: CX KidtroniK, clipping., B L A C K I E, Death Grips, and Electric Caves.|$|E
25|$|Psychic TV {{made its}} debut in 1982 at an event {{organised}} by P-Orridge, David Dawson, and Roger Ely, called The Final Academy. It was a 4-day multimedia celebratory rally held in Manchester and at the Ritzy Cinema in Brixton, South London. It brought performers and audience together with literature, performance, film and music. PTV, Cabaret Voltaire, 23 Skidoo, Z'EV, John Giorno, William S. Burroughs, Brion Gysin, Terry Wilson, Jeff Nuttall, and The Last Few Days participated to honour the <b>cut-up</b> techniques and theories of William S. Burroughs, Ian Sommerville, Antony Balch and Gysin. Video projection and early sampling were used here, as well as whispered utterances by P-Orridge reprocessed as a soundtrack to Gysin's Dreammachine by the Hafler Trio. In the mid-eighties, Psychic TV aimed to release a live album on the 23rd of each month for 23 months {{in recognition of the}} 23 enigma. The group didn't reach its goal but still managed fourteen albums in eighteen months, thus earning them an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records. Following the culmination of Psychic TV but before embarking on Thee Majesty, P-Orridge and several Psychic TV musicians formed Splinter Test, a name adopted from one of P-Orridge's essays on sampling.|$|E
5000|$|Later {{reruns of}} Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales are quite {{different}} from the original network series, like most cartoon series produced by Total Television. The first 34 Tennessee Tuxedo cartoons were incorporated into syndicated prints of The Underdog Show. That syndicated package actually was a revised version of another earlier (mid-1960s) syndicated series called Cartoon <b>Cut-Ups</b> which initially featured first season segments of Underdog, Tennessee Tuxedo, and Commander McBragg. In fact, the syndicated Underdog Show includes some artifacts such as the Cartoon <b>Cut-Ups</b> closing, combining portions of the original Tennessee Tuxedo and Underdog closings, effectively eliminating the punch line of the visual [...] "Post No Bills" [...] joke in the original Underdog closing. It also includes the final teaser {{at the end of the}} show in which announcer George S. Irving says, [...] "Looks like this is the end...but don't miss our next Cartoon <b>Cut-Ups</b> show!" [...] (The line was redubbed to say [...] "Underdog" [...] instead of [...] "Cartoon Cut-Ups.") ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1952, Reno and Smiley and the Tennessee <b>Cut-Ups</b> {{made their}} first {{recordings}} for King Records. Among this session {{was one of}} the band's most famous gospel songs, [...] "I'm Using My Bible for a Roadmap" [...] which was written by Don Reno in 1950. The sales of this record reportedly saved King Records from bankruptcy. Don Reno, Red Smiley and the Tennessee <b>Cut-Ups</b> continued recording for King Records but did no live performances until the mid-1950s which is now known to most Reno and Smiley fans as the beginning of their [...] "glory years" [...] which lasted until they disbanded in 1964.|$|R
500|$|His {{concerns}} about social control and language led Burroughs to write {{at length about}} Scientology. He had been interested in [...] Scientology since the early 1960s, having been introduced to the concepts of its founder L. Ron Hubbard by artist Brion Gysin. Burroughs's early [...] novels emphasized the power of Scientology to combat a controlling society. For example, in both The Ticket That Exploded (1962) and Nova Express (1964), Scientology, along with the <b>cut-up</b> technique, silence, and apomorphine (which he believed was an extremely effective treatment for heroin addiction), allows the characters to resist social control. These works reflected Burroughs's initial belief that Scientology could be an instrument of liberation from social control, much as he used his own <b>cut-up</b> style of writing. He sought to use cut-ups [...] "to expose the arbitrary nature and manipulative power of all linguistic systems," [...] and connected cut-ups to the theories of the self expounded by Hubbard's Dianetics. [...] As religious studies scholar John Lardas explains, [...] "the <b>cut-up</b> method was the evangelical counterpart of Scientology {{in that it was}} intended to alter a reader's consciousness".|$|E
500|$|In {{support of}} Apollo 18, They Might Be Giants {{embarked}} on a tour across the United States, Europe, and Asia. The tour was named the [...] "Don't Tread on the <b>Cut-Up</b> Snake World Tour 1992", {{a reference to the}} Gadsden flag and the [...] "Join, or Die" [...] cartoon, with the [...] "world tour" [...] affix appended by Elektra Records. The band's largest tour up to that point, spanning the length of 1992, the Don't Tread on the <b>Cut-Up</b> Snake tour was also associated with ISY. Although they were initially hesitant about using live backing musicians, it was also the first tour for which Linnell and Flansburgh were joined by a live band, consisting of a rhythm section and saxophonist. They were encouraged to adopt the larger touring outfit by their Elektra A representative, Susan Drew. The band also expanded to include a regular rhythm guitarist, bass player, and saxophone player for their subsequent studio recordings.|$|E
500|$|Electronic music duo Villains {{reworked}} [...] "Ares" [...] {{by replacing}} the big beat percussion {{of the original}} with electronic drums and synthesisers. The result was compared {{to the music of}} French band Justice by Lou Thomas of the BBC. British DJ Hervé's mix of Mercury" [...] removes the horns of the original and instead includes keyboards in an electro house-like composition. We Have Band's version of [...] "Halo" [...] is the only dub song on the Intimacy Remixed and incorporates a modulating synth line on top of <b>cut-up</b> vocals. Alex Hibbert of Rockfeedback noted its [...] "euphoric" [...] percussion. Scottish post-rockers Mogwai infused Bloc Party's blueprint in [...] "Biko" [...] with electronica elements.|$|E

500|$|These {{interests}} were shared with Jamie Reid, {{an old friend}} of McLaren who began producing publicity material for the Sex Pistols in the spring of 1976. (The <b>cut-up</b> lettering employed to create the classic Sex Pistols logo and many subsequent designs for the band was actually introduced by McLaren's friend Helen Wellington-Lloyd.) [...] "We used to talk to John [...] a lot about the Situationists," [...] Reid later said. [...] "The Sex Pistols seemed the perfect vehicle to communicate ideas directly to people who weren't getting the message from left-wing politics." [...] McLaren was also arranging for the band's first photo sessions. As described by music historian Jon Savage, [...] "With his green hair, hunched stance and ragged look, [...] looked like a cross between Uriah Heep and Richard Hell." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{set list}} for the tour {{consisted}} of songs from Ciara: The Evolution and Goodies. As featured artists did not appear on the tour, their part of the songs were edited out, namely on [...] "Oh" [...] and [...] "That's Right" [...] and the featured singles [...] "Like You" [...] by Bow Wow and [...] "Lose Control" [...] by Missy Elliott. The set decor included risers and multicolored lights. The show began with Ciara appearing on a platform one story above the stage floor. She performed her debut single [...] "Goodies", which was quickly followed by [...] "Oh". She wore tight metallic pants, a <b>cut-up</b> white T-shirt and sunglasses. The tempo of [...] "Make It Last Forever" [...] was increased and the backup dancers performed [...] "old-school" [...] breakdancing. The performance ended with Ciara and her dancers freezing in [...] "Vogue poses".|$|E
500|$|Grindcore {{lyrics are}} {{typically}} provocative. A number of grindcore musicians {{are committed to}} political and ethical causes, generally leaning towards the far left in connection to grindcore's punk roots. For example, Napalm Death's songs address a variety of anarchist concerns, {{in the tradition of}} anarcho-punk. These themes include anti-racism, feminism, anti-militarism, and anti-capitalism. Other grindcore groups, such as Cattle Decapitation and Carcass, have expressed disgust with human behavior, animal abuse, and are, in some cases, vegetarians or vegans. Carcass' work in particular is often identified as the origin of the goregrind style, which is devoted to [...] "bodily" [...] themes. Groups that shift their bodily focus to sexual matters, such as Gut and the Meat Shits, are sometimes referred to as pornogrind. Seth Putnam's lyrics are notorious for their black comedy, while The Locust tend toward satirical collage, indebted to William S. Burroughs' <b>cut-up</b> method.|$|E
