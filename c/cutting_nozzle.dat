50|$|A sewer jetter is {{composed}} of a controlled high-pressure water source such as a pressure washer or reciprocating displacement pump, a flexible high-pressure line (called a jetter hose which connects the high-pressure engine to the mini-reel) of up to hundreds of metres (several hundred feet) in length, the Mini-Reel (a hose reel which can be taken {{a distance from the}} engine) and a nozzle that uses hydraulic force to pull the line into sewer drains, clean the sides of pipes, and flush out residue. High-pressure sewer jetters can be mounted on trolleys, inside vans or on trailers. The power of a Sewer Jetter ranges from 1000 psi up to 5000 psi. Sewer jetter nozzles come in different sizes and applications; a bullet-type nozzle with a streamlined profile can clear a hole for the larger root <b>cutting</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Root-cutter nozzles are designed to cut roots with a spinning nozzle that shoots a jet stream horizontally inside the pipe. 5000 psi sewer jetters with root-cutting nozzles can clear a hole through the center of a root-infested sewer line and with its rear-facing jet streams cut the roots and clean the pipe walls, flushing the root debris through the sewer line. The sewer jetter has been labeled as a technological advancement of the plumber's snake (also known as an electric eel) drain clearing method.|$|E
40|$|DE 102008027524 B 3 UPAB: 20090928 NOVELTY - The {{laser cutting}} unit is moved conventionally, {{relative}} to the workpiece (1. 4). In a novel arrangement, the <b>cutting</b> <b>nozzle</b> (1. 3) fastened to the cutting head (1) can also be moved in two axial directions, parallel {{to the surface of}} the workpiece. This additional movement is caused by a separate drive system. The new arrangement increases the working area of the laser cutter. The focusing optic (1. 2) is a telecentric planar field optic and/or a telecentric F-theta optic. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The <b>cutting</b> <b>nozzle</b> rotates about an axis directed at right angles to the workpiece surface. The rotational axis of the nozzle, or of its opening, is located eccentrically with respect to the longitudinal axis of the cutting head. An eccentric drive moves the <b>cutting</b> <b>nozzle.</b> A double-eccentric drive is used, with two drive motors. These are independently-controlled. The eccentric drives are connected. They are arranged one inside the other, or one above the other. Through combined nozzle movement and beam (10) deflection, the operational area achieved on the workpiece reaches at least 7 mm 2. The <b>cutting</b> <b>nozzle</b> is alternatively moved by two independently-controlled linear drives. The drives used are: moving coil, pneumatic or hydraulic. The linear drives act on the <b>cutting</b> <b>nozzle</b> from the radial exterior of the unit, and are articulated to it. The laser beam and cutting gas are directed through the nozzle onto the workpiece. The nozzle opening is circular, elliptical or slot-shaped. The nozzle is held by a cross-slide assembly with linear drives to each slide. The beam deflection includes an oscillatory motion. AN INDEPENDENT CLAIM IS INCLUDED FOR the corresponding laser cutting method. USE - Agile laser cutting equipment with a mirror deflecting the focused beam. ADVANTAGE - By superimposing mechanical and optical deflections, variation of cutting direction can be achieved with smaller radii. This accelerates the cutting operation, increasing production and saving cutting gas. At the same time, stressing of the equipment by accelerations and torques is reduced. Wear is reduced and equipment life is extended. Movements of individual drives become smoother. Agility is increased without increase in the size of the gas opening, so cutting gas is conserved. The additional drives permit simpler optics to be used if required. This minimizes cost. Advantages of differing types of nozzle drives are discussed further in the disclosure. Gas flow is readily matched with the cutting requirement and either conical-cylindrical or Laval nozzles can be used...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been undertaken {{to study the}} depth of cut in multipass abrasive waterjet (AWJ) cutting of an 87 % alumina ceramic with controlled nozzle oscillation. The experimental data have been statistically analysed to study the trends of the depth of cut {{with respect to the}} process parameters. It has been found that multipass <b>cutting</b> with controlled <b>nozzle</b> oscillation can significantly increase the depth of cut. Within the same cutting time and using the same cutting parameters other than the jet traverse speed, it has been found that multipass <b>cutting</b> with <b>nozzle</b> oscillation can increase the depth of cut by an average of 74. 6 % as compared to single pass <b>cutting</b> without <b>nozzle</b> oscillation. Furthermore, a multipass <b>cutting</b> with higher <b>nozzle</b> traverse speeds can achieve a larger depth of cut than a single pass cutting at a low traverse speed within the same cutting time. A recommendation has been made for the selection of appropriate process parameters for multipass <b>cutting</b> with <b>nozzle</b> oscillation. In order to estimate the depth of cut on a mathematical basis, predictive models for the depth of cut in multipass cutting with and without nozzle oscillation have been developed using a dimensional analysis technique. The model development starts with the models for single pass cutting which are then extended to multipass cutting where considerations are given to the change of the actual standoff distance after each pass and the variation of kerf width. These predictive models has been numerically studied for their plausibility by assessing their predicted trends with respect to the various process variables, and verified qualitatively and quantitatively based on the experimental data. The model assessment reveals that the developed models correlate very well with the experimental results and can give adequate predictions of this cutting performance measure in process planning...|$|R

Further developments are still required to optimize the cutting performance of such technology {{before it can be}} considered as an alternative to CO 2 or fiber laser variants. In this paper, laser polarization control is studied as a strategy to enhance the cutting performance of such lasers systems. For this purpose, two DDL sources, with output powers in the range of 750 W, have been installed in an experimental gantry platform which allows an independent control of common cutting parameters (focal point position, stand-of-distance, <b>cutting</b> speed, <b>nozzle</b> opening, gas selection, and gas pressure). Different optical designs and combinations of optical components were used to obtain a set of spatial polarization arrangements, including: linear-, cross-, azimuthal-, and radial-polarizations schemes. A series of experiments on different materials (stainless steel 304 L and 316 L and steel S 355) were done to verify the influence of such configurations on laser cutting of metals with both reactive and nonreactive gases. Influence of polarization on the cutting results is found to be very high when cutting with a nonreactive gas, such as nitrogen, while the same effects are less evident when a reactive gas, oxygen, is used.

40|$|One of the {{principle}} deficiencies of the abrasive water jet (AWJ) cutting process is wavy striations on the generated cut surface in relatively thick workpieces. A desirable surface finish can be obtained only when {{the thickness of the}} workpiece is less than the depth of the smooth zone.

In this study, different nozzle oscillation cutting techniques were developed to optimise the AWJ machining process.

In the market there are systems which are highly focused on special {{applications such as}} robot based 3 D cutting in the automotive industry but also all-round machines which cut a diverse set of sheet steels {{at a variety of}} thicknesses. Most of these machines use a melt based cutting process where the molten material is ejected by an assist gas. Quality of the laser cut part is determined by a dross free cut with minimal roughness on the cut face. To ensure this quality, several parameters of the cutting process have to be within their defined tolerances. Such parameters are the focal position, the distance of the <b>cutting</b> <b>nozzle</b> to the work piece and the beam quality to name only the most important ones. The paper reports about the approach to equip industrial laser cutting systems with sensors such that manufacturing quality comes to an advanced level.

As a next step, active control of the laser focal position has been demonstrated keeping the process at its nominal operating point in this respect. The benefits for manufacture are discussed in relation to machine setup and sustainability. The reported system relies on expert knowledge about the system behaviour in order to reference the measurement signal to the focal position.

50|$|All waterjets {{follow the}} same {{principle}} of using high pressure water focused into a beam by a nozzle. Most machines accomplish this by first running the water through a high pressure pump. There {{are two types of}} pumps used to create this high pressure; an intensifier pump and a direct drive or crankshaft pump. A direct drive pump works much like a car engine, forcing water through high pressure tubing using plungers attached to a crankshaft. An intensifier pump creates pressure by using hydraulic oil to move a piston forcing the water through a tiny hole. The water then travels along the high pressure tubing to the nozzle of the waterjet. In the nozzle, the water is focused into a thin beam by a jewel orifice. This beam of water is ejected from the <b>nozzle,</b> <b>cutting</b> through the material by spraying it with the jet of high-speed water. The process is the same for abrasive waterjets until the water reaches the nozzle. Here abrasives such as garnet and aluminium oxide, are fed into the nozzle via an abrasive inlet. The abrasive then mixes with the water in a mixing tube and is forced out the end at high pressure.|$|R
40|$|Abrasive {{waterjet}} (AWJ) cutting {{is one of}} {{the most}} recently developed manufacturing technologies. It is superior to many other cutting techniques in processing various materials, particularly in processing difficult-to-cut materials. This technology is being increasingly used in various industries. However, its cutting capability in terms of the depth of jet penetration and kerf quality is the major obstruction limiting its further applications. More work is required to fully understand the cutting process and cutting mechanism, and to optimise cutting performance. This thesis presents a comprehensive study on the controlled nozzle oscillation technique aiming at increasing the cutting performance in AWJ machining. In order to understand the current state and development in AWJ cutting, an extensive literature review is carried out. It has found that the reported studies on controlled <b>nozzle</b> oscillation <b>cutting</b> are primarily about the use of large oscillation angles of 10 degrees or more. Nozzle oscillation in the cutting plane with such large oscillation angles results in theoretical geometrical errors on the component profile in contouring. No published attempt has been found on the study of oscillation cutting under small angles although it is a common application in practice. Particularly, there is no reported research on the integration of nozzle oscillation technique into AWJ multipass cutting, which is expected to significantly enhance the cutting performance. An experimental investigation is first undertaken to study the major cutting performance measures in AWJ single pass cutting of an 87 % alumina ceramic with controlled nozzle oscillation at small angles. The trends and characteristics of cutting performance quantities with respect to the process parameters as well as the science behind which nozzle oscillation affects the cutting performance have been analysed. It has been shown that as with oscillation cutting at large angles, oscillation at small angles can have an equally significant impact on the cutting performance. When the optimum cutting parameters are used for both nozzle oscillation and normal cutting, the former can statistically increase the depth of cut by 23 % and smooth depth of cut by 30. 8 %, and reduce kerf surface roughness by 11. 7 % and kerf taper by 54 %. It has also been found that if the cutting parameters are not selected properly, nozzle oscillation can reduce some major cutting performance measures. In order to correctly select the process parameters and to optimise the cutting process, the mathematical models for major cutting performance measures have then been developed. The predictive models for the depth of cut in both normal cutting and oscillation cutting are developed by using a dimensional analysis technique. Mathematical models for other major cutting performance measures are also developed with the aid of empirical approach. These mathematical models are verified both qualitatively and quantitatively based on the experimental data. The assessment reveals that the developed models conform well to the experimental results and can provide an effective means for the optimum selection of process variables in AWJ <b>cutting</b> with <b>nozzle</b> oscillation. A further experimental investigation of AWJ cutting of alumina ceramics is carried out in order to study the application of AWJ oscillation technique in multipass <b>cutting.</b> While high <b>nozzle</b> traverse speed with multipass can achieve overall better cutting performance than low traverse speed with single pass in the same elapsed time, it has been found that the different combination of nozzle traverse speed with the number of passes significantly affects cutting process. Optimum combination of nozzle traverse speed with the number of passes is determined to achieve maximum depth of cut. It has also demonstrated that the multipass <b>cutting</b> with low <b>nozzle</b> traverse speed in the first pass and a comparatively high traverse speed for the following passes is a sensible choice for a small kerf taper requirement. When nozzle oscillation is incorporated into multipass cutting, it can greatly increase the depth of cut and reduce kerf taper. The predictive models for the depth of cut in both multipass normal cutting and multipass oscillation cutting are finally developed. With the help of dimensional analysis, the models of the incremental cutting depth for individual pass are derived based on the developed depth of cut models for single pass cutting. The models of depth of cut for a multipass cutting operation are then established by the sum of the incremental cutting depth from each pass. A numerical analysis has verified the models and demonstrated the adequacy of the models' predictions. The models provide an essential basis for the development of optimization strategies for the effective use of the AWJ cutting technology when the multipass cutting technique is used with controlled nozzle oscillation...|$|R

Paper, textiles, food, plastics and ceramics are frequently cut this way. For the separation of metals, ceramics and compound materials, such as metal plastics, abrasives have generally to be added. Permanently increasing demands in the branch of product engineering concerning exactitude, quality, security, flexibility and economic efficiency have led in jetcutting technology to the development of modern NC- or CNC-controlled high-pressure jetcutting systems. Besides, the water jet is applied as a device in flexible production systems. Increasing demands concerning the manufacturing of products or components necessitate an optimal conception of the manufacturing processes. In order to meet the requirements of given work tolerances, a detailed process of monitoring and controlling is necessary for the quality control of the finished product. Today, "onli ne" monitoring and controlling systems are increasingly applied in manufacturing, engineering and processing. Comparable process controlling systems have not been common in jetcutting technology up to now, since process-specific sensor systems have not been available.

The thesis discuss the experimental analysis to predict the effect of the process parameter on kerf width and taper on acrylic sheet.

Therefore, {{there is a great}} prospect in the field of refractories, <b>nozzles,</b> <b>cutting</b> tools, and bearings. In addition, ceramic material belongs to the boron-containing series ceramics and can generate boron oxide lubricating film dissolved with other elements under friction and high temperature (800 – 1000  °C) driving, which can realize self-lubricating and is a very good self-lubricating material [2]. Ceramic {{material has}} good neutron control capabilities and can be used in the nuclear industry. However, the sintering densification of ceramic materials is more difficult in bending strength, and the defects of low fracture toughness limit its application scope. It often fails because of damage [3]. Related studies have shown that [4] (W,Ti)C composites can effectively increase the bending strength and fracture toughness of composite ceramic materials. With the increasing demand for composite materials in modern engineering, during the preparation of composite ceramic materials, if the formulation is not optimized, ceramic material grain growth and abnormal growth may occur during the preparation process. (W,Ti)C grain distribution is not uniform and will not achieve the purpose of improving the performance of composite ceramic materials. Therefore, optimizing the proportion of the two components in composite ceramic materials is very important to improve the performance of composite ceramic materials. In addition, adding (W,Ti)C composites to ceramic material can also significantly improve its mechanical properties. The level of mechanical properties of [5] is closely related to the microstructure. But the mechanical properties are closely related to the microstructure. The grain growth during sintering determines the evolution of the microstructure and the local topological structure of the sintered body, and the bending strength of the sintered body. Fracture toughness and hardness play an important role. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the grain growth in the sintering process of ceramic materials and optimize the sintering process to improve the bending strength, fracture toughness, and hardness of the materials.|$|R

Beam qualities below 2. 5 mm mrad at a wavelength of about 1 my m and a laser power in the area of several kW enable new possibilities in laser processing. With such characteristics it is possible to cut thin sheets with very high cutting rates. However, these cutting speeds cannot be achieved with linear drives, {{especially in the case of}} cutting contours. Thus the cutting speeds are currently limited by the dynamic of the used handling system. Cutting speeds limited by the ability of the laser are much higher. A solution to minimize this gap is described in the presented research paper. This paper describes a smart solution using the advantages of high brightness lasers - the remote cutting. Firstly a short introduction of the process is given and the experimental equipment will be explained. Disclaiming any <b>cutting</b> gas a <b>nozzle</b> is no longer necessary. Thereby the working distance does no longer depend on the distance between the nozzle and the work piece. In combination with a 2 D-Scanner the laser beam is flexible in the working field of the scanner. Afterwards a thermodynamic characterization of the remote cutting process is carried out. The investigations show a process, which is completely different from conventional laser cutting. The cutting kerf is generated by a layer by layer ablation process. However, an example shows that contour cutting speeds of about 100 m/min are possible...|$|R
