50|$|<b>Crossed</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> is {{also called}} {{two-dimensional}} quantitative immunoelectrophoresis ad modum Clarke and Freeman or ad modum Laurell. In this method the proteins are first separated {{during the first}} dimension electrophoresis, then instead of the diffusion towards the antibodies, the proteins are electrophoresed into an antibody-containing gel in the second dimension. Immunoprecipitation will take place during the second dimension electrophorsis andthe immunoprecipitates have a characteristic bell-shape, each precipitate representing one antigen, {{the position of the}} precipitate being dependent on the amount of protein as well as the amount of specific antibody in the gel, so relative quantification can be performed. The sensitivity and resolving power of <b>crossed</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> is than that of the classical immunoelectrophoretic analysis and there are multiple variations of the technique useful for various purposes. <b>Crossed</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> has been used for studies of proteins in biological fluids, particularly human serum, and biological extracts.|$|E

50|$|Immunoelectrophoresis is {{a general}} name {{for a number of}} {{biochemical}} methods for separation and characterization of proteins based on electrophoresis and reaction with antibodies. All variants of immunoelectrophoresis require immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, reacting with the proteins to be separated or characterized.

40|$|Oral {{inoculation}} of the porcine {{small intestine}} with live TGE virus {{has been shown}} to elicit a local cell-mediated response as well as a peripheral lymphocyte response. This has not been shown to occur following intramuscular (IM) administration of the pathogen. In the research described in this dissertation both a local and a systemic cell-mediated response were induced in response to IM inoculation of a subunit glycoprotein component isolated from pigs which were immunized with a TGEV subunit glycoprotein. The cells were assayed in vitro for a blast transformation response. Reactive lymophocytes were discovered in peripheral blood, Peyer 2 ̆ 7 s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes. Little if any reactivity was observed for splenic lymphocytes. Peripheral blood lyphocytes which were sensitized to the glycoprotein derived from the Illinois strain of TGEV responded strongly to the Miller strain glycoprotein. Anti-porcine thymocyte serum plus complement eliminated most of the lymphocyte response;Characterization of the glycoprotein was carried out by PAGE, SDS-PAGE, immunodiffusion, IEF, rocket <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> and <b>cross</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis.</b> A molecular weight of 67, 000 was revealed for the subunit with SDS-PAGE; a P. I. of 3. 86 was determined by isoelectric focusing. Immunodiffusion, rocket <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> and <b>cross</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> of the Miller and Illinois glycoprotein demonstrated a similar major antigenic component.

Catalase and peroxidase {{activities were}} demonstrated in polyacrylamide and <b>crossed</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> gels for M. lepraemurium, M. intracellulare, and BCG, {{but not for}} M. leprae. Peroxidase and catalase activities {{were associated with the}} same precipitate line in <b>crossed</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> for M. lepraemurium, M. intracellulare, and BCG, showing that in these mycobacteria the two enzyme activities resided in the same molecule. M. smegmatis peroxidase and catalase activities were closely associated on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but on the <b>crossed</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> catalase and peroxidase activities were associated with two different precipitate lines. Catalases without peroxidase activity were demonstrated in <b>crossed</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in M. intracellulare and M. smegmatis. The catalase without peroxidase activity in M. intracellulare was heat resistant and therefore classified as an m-catalase. In M. smegmatis the catalase without peroxidase activity was only partially heat resistant. All of the catalases with peroxidase activity were heat-sensitive t-catalases. Superoxide dismutase activity in the <b>crossed</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> was associated with the M. leprae antigen no. 4 and with cross-reacting antigens in the other mycobacteria studied. Several superoxide dismutases were demonstrated in Mycobacterium duvalii. They were antigenically different from the other superoxide dismutases in this study, as shown by lack of reactivity with a monospecific antibody to M. lepraemurium superoxide dismutase.

By using antisera raised against crude pyridine extract antigen, two immunogenic components were resolved by <b>crossed</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis.</b> A similar analysis of DDA using antisera raised against crude DDA revealed 15 immunogens. All but six components were heat labile, whereas pronase had little effect on the number of resolvable components. Intermediate gel <b>crossed</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> using antiserum raised to whole spores detected six immunogenic components, four of which were also detected by the anti-DDA serum. A total of 19 bands were obtained when the DDA was subjected to flatbed isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gels. The isoelectric points for the various components were found to range from 3. 5 to 5. 7. <b>Crossed</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> using isoelectric focusing in the first dimension yielded at least 16 immunogenic components.

The reactions of these cellular fractions, in <b>crossed</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis,</b> with reference anti-whole cell immunoglobulins disclosed five antigens in the capsular extract, seven in the potassium thiocyanate extract, one to three in the lipopolysaccharide, three in the heat-stable antigens, and five in the free endoxin. Comparison of these reference antigen 2 ̆ 013 antibody systems, in <b>crossed</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis,</b> with intermediate gel containing either a reference anti-cell envelope or anticytoplasmic immunoglobulins not only revealed the presence of additional antigens but also gave insight into the probable cellular origins (i. e., cell surface, cell envelope, or cytoplasm) of various antigens unveiled by reference anti-whole cell immunoglobulins. Using the principle of tandem <b>crossed</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> and crossed-line immunoelectrophoresis the immunochemical relationships between the antigenic components of these reference antigen 2 ̆ 013 antibody systems were established.

40|$|Lactose-sensitive fimbriae were {{identified}} as the only fimbriae present on Actinomyces naeslundii WVU 45 (ATCC 12104). A single antigen reactive with antiserum against WVU 45 cells was detected by <b>cross</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> of isolated fimbriae, and a monospecific antiserum against this antigen reacted with all fimbriae observed on the bacterial surface by immunoelectron microscopy. Moreover, the loss of one cell surface antigen by a spontaneous mutant of A. naeslundii WVU 45 (WVU 45 M), isolated by its failure to react with a monospecific antibody against the fimbriae, {{was associated with the}} loss of all fimbriae. The functional involvement of the fimbriae in lactose-sensitive bacterial adherence was demonstrated by the ability of WVU 45, but not WVU 45 M, cells to agglutinate neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes and by the lactose-sensitive hemagglutinating activity of immune complexes formed with isolated fimbriae and monospecific antibody. Bacterial agglutination assays with different monospecific antibodies revealed an antigenic similarity between the fimbriae of A. naeslundii WVU 45 and the lactose-sensitive fimbriae (type 2) of Actinomyces viscosus T 14 V. In contrast, cross-reactivity was not observed between the WVU 45 fimbriae and type 1 fimbriae, the structures involved in lactose-resistant adherence of strain T 14 V to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. Functional differences between the fimbriae of A. naeslundii and A. viscosus strains may be correlated with well-established differences in the in vivo distribution of these organisms: namely, the preference of typical A. naeslundii for epithelial surfaces and of A. viscosus for tooth surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Recessive type 3 von Willebrand disease (VWD) {{is caused}} by {{homozygosity}} or double heterozygosity for two non-sense mutations (null alleles). Type 3 VWD is easy to diagnose by {{the combination of a}} strongly prolonged bleeding time (BT), absence of ristocetine-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA), absence of von Willebrand factor (VWF) protein, and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) due to factor VIII:coagulant (FVIII:C) deficiency. VWD type 3 is associated with a pronounced tendency to mucocutaneous and musculoskeletal bleedings since early childhood. Carriers of one null allele are usually asymptomatic at VWF levels of 50 % of normal. Recessive severe type 1 VWD {{is caused by}} homozygosity or double heterozygosity for a missense mutation. Recessive type 1 VWD differs from type 3 VWD by the presence of detectable von Willebrand factor: antigen VWF:Ag and FVIII:C levels between 0. 09 and 0. 40 U/mL. Patients with recessive type 1 VWD show an abnormal VWF multimeric pattern in plasma and/or platelets consistent with severe type 2 VWD. Carriers of a missense mutation may have mild bleeding and mild VWF deficiency and can be diagnosed by a double VWF peak on <b>cross</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> (CIE). There will be cases of mild and moderate recessive type 1 VWD due to double heterozygosity of two missense mutations, or with the combination of one missense mutation with a non-sense or bloodgroup O. Mild deficiency of VWF in the range of 0. 20 to 0. 60 U/mL, with normal ratios of von Willebrand factor: ristocetine cofactor/antigen VWF:RCo/Ag and VWF:collagen binding/antigen (VWF:CB/Ag), normal VWF multimers, and a completely normal response to desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) with VWF level rising from below to above 1. 00 U/mL are very likely cases of so-called pseudo-VWF defienciecy in individuals with normal VWF protein and gene. Autosomal dominant type 1 VWD variants are in fact type 2 variants caused by a heterozygous missense mutation in the VWF gene that produces a mutant VWF protein that has a dominant effect on normal VWF protein produced by the normal VWF allele with regard to the synthesis, processing, storage, secretion, and/or proteolysis of VWF in endothelial cells. A DDAVP challenge test clearly differentiates between dominant type 1 VWD phenotype and dominant type 2 M VWD...|$|R

40|$|This {{study shows}} that the capsular polysaccharide, protein, and {{lipopolysaccharide}} antigens from the outer membrane of Neisseria meningitidis group B serotype 2 may be identified by <b>crossed</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis.</b> By using this technique, seven precipitates were resolved when outer membrane preparations were reacted against goat anti-whole cell group B type 2 antiserum.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{degree of}} {{branching}} {{and types of}} fucosylation of glycans on alpha(1) -acid glycoprotein (AGP) {{have been found to}} be associated with alpha(1) -acid glycoprotein concentrations in human seminal plasma. The glycosylation pattern of alpha(1) -acid glycoprotein in seminal plasma obtained from men living in infertile couples can undergo alterations in relation to sperm analysis and/or alpha(1) -acid glycoprotein concentrations. METHODS: The glycosylation of alpha(1) -acid glycoprotein was studied upon the reactivity with specific lectins by <b>crossed</b> affinity <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> (concanavalin A), and by glycoprotein lectin immunosorbent assay (Maackia amurensis and Sambucus nigra lectins), as well as high pH anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection. RESULTS: Nonsignificant differences in alpha(1) -acid glycoprotein glycan branching and degree of its sialylation were observed among the AGP derived from seminal plasmas in relation to spermiogram and sperm morphology. However, significant concentration-dependent differences were found in extent of branching and type of sialylation. CONCLUSIONS: The presence in seminal plasma of high concentrations of aberrantly glycosylated AGP molecules might be indicative for a chronic inflammatory condition in the reproductive tract, and can be used as additional tool to subdivide the seminal plasmas of men living in infertile couples...|$|R
40|$|Antisera against mycelial-phase, but not yeast-phase, Candida albicans absorbed with yeast-phase organisms {{preferentially}} stained germ tube {{segments of}} several strains of mycelial-phase C. albicans by the indirect fluorescent-antibody staining technique. Germ tube segment antigens {{were not found}} in significant amounts on blastospore segments or on yeast-phase organisms. Absorption of the mycelial-phase reference sera with yeast-phase C. stellatoidea, but not with C. tropicalis, C. guillermondii, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, resulted in preferential germ tube segment staining of C. albicans. A dithiothreitol extract of mycelial-phase C. albicans organisms blocked staining of the germ tube segment, but a dithiothreitol extract of yeast-phase organisms did not. When dithiothreitol extracts from both phases were reacted against yeast-absorbed reference sera in tandem crossed and <b>crossed</b> line <b>immunoelectrophoresis,</b> a cross-reacting arc and several arcs unique to the mycelial-phase extract were noted. Immunofluorescent staining tests were performed, using appropriately absorbed sera from patients with candidiasis to stain a laboratory strain of C. albicans. Human tissue slices infected with C. albicans were used as targets for appropriately absorbed rabbit antisera. These human data indicated that antigens preferentially expressed on the germ tube in vitro were also expressed on filamentous structures of the fungus in infected human tissues.

Laparotomy of women, for the removal of benign tumors of the uterus, was used as a model for the development of the hepatic acute phase response. Hugh increases were detected in the amounts of strongly AAL-reactive fractions of AGP, presumably containing three or more fucosylated N-acetyllactosamine units. At least part of these Lewis X-type glycans (Gal beta 1 [...] >[Fuc alpha 1 [...] > 3]GlcNAc-R) appeared to be substituted also with an alpha 2 [...] > 3 -linked sialic acid residue. This was revealed by the laparotomy- induced abundant staining of AGP with an antisialyl Lewis X monoclonal antibody (CSLEX- 1) on blots of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels containing AGP isolated from the sera of a patient at various days after operation. It is concluded that acute inflammation induces a strong increase in sialyl Lewis X-substituted AGP molecules that persists at a high level throughout the inflammatory period. We postulate that these changes represent a physiological feedback response on the interaction between leukocytes and inflamed endothelium, which is mediated via sialylated Lewis X structures and the selectin endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule 1...|$|R

40|$|Addition of group-specific {{component}} (Gc) to G-actin with {{or without}} deoxyribonuclease I (DNAase) led to formation of binary complexes (Gc-G-actin) and ternary complexes (Gc-G-actin-DNAase) respectively. The electrophoretic mobility of ternary complexes, as shown by <b>crossed</b> and rocket <b>immunoelectrophoresis,</b> was slower than that of binary complexes, although both were faster than native Gc. In gradient polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, such complexes could again be resolved, apparently {{on the basis of}} relative molecular size: Gc-G-actin-DNAase (Mr approx. 131000), Gc-G-actin (Mr approx. 98000) and Gc (Mr approx. 56000). In contrast, the pI of ternary complex was indistinguishable by isoelectric focusing from that of binary complex, even though both were clearly more acidic than native Gc. The affinity of Gc for G-actin (affinity constant, Ka, 1. 9 X 10 (8) M- 1) was not significantly altered by additional interaction with DNAase (Ka, 1. 5 X 10 (8) M- 1), and both binary and ternary complexes still bound 25 -hydroxycholecalciferol. In addition, the inhibitory effect of G-actin on DNAase activity was not discernibly affected by interaction with Gc.

Four of these had antigens in common with the still unnumbered fimbrial antigens of an O 4 :K 12 :H 5 strain. In the fifth strain, no known F antigens were demonstrated. The previously found correlation between some O:K:H serotypes and fimbrial antigens in strains from urinary tract infections was confirmed in this study in strains from diarrhea cases. We concluded that, although the agglutination test can indicate the presence of certain fimbriae, it cannot be used presently for an exact demonstration of these antigens because each strain often produces several different fimbriae...|$|E

40|$|By use of <b>crossed</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> techniques, {{respiratory}} syncytial (RS) virus-specific precipitates {{were produced}} between RS virus cellular antigen [solubilized in tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane-glycine buffer, pH 9] and antiserum raised in rabbits against semipurified RS virus. When these precipitates were employed as antigens for further immunizations in rabbits, antibodies (anti-RSV-precip. I) were produced which reacted {{with only one}} RS virus antigen when tested by the <b>crossed</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> technique. Precipitates obtained between RS virus cellular antigen (labeled with L-[35 S]methionine) and anti-RSV-precip. I were examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which showed that anti-RSV-precip. I precipitated RS virus polypeptides of molecular weights 28, 000 to 84, 000. Anti-RSV-precip. I was employed as capture antibodies in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, in which RS virus cellular antigen {{was used as the}} second layer. Determination of human RS virus immunoglobulin G antibodies by this enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique showed a high degree of sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility...|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} types of immune reactions against liver membrane antigens have been described: firstly, cell-mediated immunity and autoantibodies against the liver-specific protein (LSP) in HBsAg-negative and HBsAg-positive chronic active hepatitis (CAH), and secondly, a liver membrane autoantibody (LMA) in HBsAg-negative CAH. Using 100, 000 g supernatants of human and rabbit liver homogenates, the corresponding antigen of LMA could be separated by affinity chromatography on insolubilized LMA-positive sera from patients with HBsAg-negative CAH. A further characterization by <b>crossed</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis</b> showed that LMA is directed against a soluble liver membrane antigen (LM-Ag) {{that is not a}} constituent of the purified LSP. LM-Ag seems to be species-unspecific and moves faster than LSP and serum albumin in <b>crossed</b> <b>immunoelectrophoresis.</b> While LSP is believed {{to be involved in the}} pathogenesis of HBsAg-negative and HBsAg-positive chronic active hepatitis, LM-Ag may be a target antigen only in cases of HBsAg-negative autoimmune CAH...|$|E
