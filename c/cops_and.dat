5|$|Midtown Madness {{supports}} multiplayer games via {{local area}} network, Internet, or serial cable connection. Multiplayer mode was originally supported by Microsoft's MSN Gaming Zone, but this service was retired on June 19, 2006. It is now supported by similar {{services such as}} GameSpy Arcade and XFire, via DirectPlay. Multiplayer mode includes a <b>Cops</b> <b>and</b> Robbers mode, a capture the flag-style game in which players form two teams and each team tries to steal the opposing team's cache of gold {{and return it to}} their own hideout.|$|E
5|$|Rick {{discovers the}} {{residents}} of Terminus engage in cannibalism, but the group manage to destroy Terminus and reunite.

Morgan, who has been searching for Rick, arrives and is shocked to see Rick killing an Alexandrian, who has been abusing his wife, in anger.|$|E
5|$|Among big-budget auteurs, Michael Mann {{has worked}} {{frequently}} in a neo-noir mode, with {{such films as}} Thief (1981) and Heat (1995) and the TV series Miami Vice (1984–89) and Crime Story (1986–88). Mann's output exemplifies a primary strain of neo-noir, in which classic themes and tropes are revisited in a contemporary setting with an up-to-date visual style and rock- or hip hop–based musical soundtrack. Like Chinatown, its more complex predecessor, Curtis Hanson's Oscar-winning L.A. Confidential (1997), based on the James Ellroy novel, demonstrates an opposite tendency—the deliberately retro film noir; its tale of corrupt <b>cops</b> <b>and</b> femmes fatales is seemingly lifted straight from a film of 1953, {{the year in which}} it is set. Director David Fincher followed the immensely successful neo-noir Seven (1995) with a film that developed into a cult favorite after its original, disappointing release: Fight Club (1999) is a sui generis mix of noir aesthetic, perverse comedy, speculative content, and satiric intent.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cop</b> <b>and</b> his {{assistant}} {{go to the}} <b>cop</b> <b>and</b> the judge who closed {{the case of the}} murder of Dhanam's husband, her in-laws and the priest and have a conversation about the case. The <b>cop</b> <b>and</b> the assistant asked the <b>cop</b> <b>and</b> the judge about their opinion. They both said that Dhanam is innocent. She just showed the anger a mom has. The film ends with that the <b>cop</b> <b>and</b> the assistant close the case and let Dhanam go.|$|R

5|$|Star Cops is a British {{science fiction}} {{television}} series first broadcast on BBC2 in 1987. It was devised by Chris Boucher, {{a writer who}} had previously worked on the science fiction television series Doctor Who and Blake's 7 as well as crime dramas such as Juliet Bravo and Bergerac. Set in the year 2027, a time where Interplanetary travel has become commonplace, it starred David Calder as Nathan Spring, commander of the International Space Police Force—nicknamed the “Star Cops"—who provide law enforcement for the newly developing colonies of the Solar System. The series follows Nathan Spring {{and the rest of}} his multinational team as they work to establish the Star <b>Cops</b> <b>and</b> solve whatever crimes come their way. Operating in a relatively accurately realised hard SF, near-future, space environment, many of the cases that the Star Cops investigate arise from opportunities for new crimes presented by the technologically advanced future society the series depicts and from the hostile frontier nature of the environment that the Star Cops live in.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the trailer shown at the official reveal during E3 2012, several other game trailers were released, each revealing new aspects of the game. An episode of PWND, released in August 2012, featured new footage of Need for Speed: Most Wanted, and covered information on the single and multiplayer mode of the game, and the Autolog 2.0. One trailer revealed {{some of the new}} cars from the game. Two trailers revealed the multiplayer aspect of the game. One trailer showcased how players will be able to drive any car they find in the open world location of the game. Two trailers revealed the single-player aspect of the game. One trailer showcased the relationship between the <b>cops</b> <b>and</b> racers. An extended version of its live action TV advert splices real footage with some gameplay. A trailer was released to explain the game's Kinect integration. One trailer showed off Wii U gameplay.|$|E
40|$|Postural control deficits {{have been}} {{identified}} among individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) compared to healthy controls. Although deficits in static balance have previously been reported using center of pressure (<b>COP)</b> <b>and,</b> more recently, time to boundary (TTB) measures, the underlying mechanism behind these deficits warrants further investigation. It is unclear if {{there are differences in}} the spatial distribution of <b>COP</b> <b>and</b> TTBminima data points under the foot. Our purpose was to determine if there are differences in the location of the distribution of the <b>COP</b> <b>and</b> the TTB minima data points between groups with and without CAI. Fifty healthy and 61 CAI subjects participated in this case–control study. The subjects performed three successful 10 -s trials of quiet single limb stance on a force plate with eyes-open and -closed conditions. Results showed that during eyes-open trials, the CAI group exhibited more <b>COP</b> <b>and</b> TTB minima data points on the anterolateral aspect of the foot compared to controls. With eyes-closed single limb balance, the CAI group demonstrated significantly more <b>COP</b> <b>and</b> TTB minima data points anterior to the horizontal midline of the foot compared to controls. Overall, the CAI group showed a greater anterior displacement of <b>COP</b> <b>and</b> TTB minima during single limb static stance compared to controls. This alteration may result from the CAI subjects adopting a more dorsiflexed position {{in an effort to keep}} the ankle in a more stable, closed pack position and limiting the available degrees of freedom in the distal lower extremity...|$|R

500|$|Terrance Dicks {{has felt}} that Moonbase 3 was {{ultimately}} a failure: [...] "The trouble was {{we built a}} too restrictive format for ourselves" [...] and that the series [...] "lacked a sense of wonder and outrageousness". [...] Academic Peter Wright has said about Moonbase 3 that its [...] "appeal to realism resulted in a disquieting sense of claustrophobia and isolation that undermined the optimism of its premise and captured the general mood of insularity felt (and often desired) in Britain in the early 1970s". [...] Moonbase 3, although not directly influential, {{can be seen as}} an antecedent of similar realistic, near-future, British space series such as Star <b>Cops</b> <b>and</b> Space Island One.|$|E

It was described as a [...] "show about grief" [...] when it first started airing and that the [...] "cause of the car crash didn't really matter" [...] at that time. Now, however, The A.V. Club noted that Awake is [...] "dabbling in crooked <b>cops</b> <b>and</b> God only knows what else". He observed that Michael could be having another defense to keep the fantasy world alive because of his thoughts with Hawkins.|$|E
