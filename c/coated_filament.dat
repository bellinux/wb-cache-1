40|$|Background Even {{though more}} than 600 stroke {{treatments}} {{have been shown}} effective in preclinical studies, clinically proven treatment alternatives for cerebral infarction remain scarce. Amongst {{the reasons for the}} discrepancy may be methodological shortcomings, such as high mortality and outcome variability, in the preclinical studies. A common approach in animal stroke experiments is that A) focal cerebral ischemia is inflicted, B) some type of treatment is administered and C) the infarct sizes are assessed. However, within this paradigm, the researcher has to make numerous methodological decisions, including choosing rat strain and type of surgical procedure. Even though a few studies have attempted to address the questions experimentally, a lack of consensus regarding the optimal methodology remains. Methods We therefore meta-analyzed data from 502 control groups described in 346 articles to find out how rat strain, procedure for causing focal cerebral ischemia and the type of filament coating affected mortality and infarct size variability. Results The Wistar strain and intraluminal filament procedure using a silicone <b>coated</b> <b>filament</b> was found optimal in lowering infarct size variability. The direct and endothelin methods rendered lower mortality rate, whereas the embolus method increased it compared to the filament method.

The filamentous TDP- 43 accumulations typically contain clean 10 - 12 nm filaments though wider 18 - 20 nm <b>coated</b> <b>filaments</b> may be observed. The TDP- 43 present within these lesions is phosphorylated, truncated and ubiquitinated, and these modifications appear to be abnormal as they are linked to both a cellular heat shock response and microglial activation. The mechanisms associated with this abnormal TDP- 43 accumulation are believed {{to result in a}} loss of TDP- 43 function, perhaps due to the post-translational modifications or resulting from physical sequestration of the TDP- 43. The formation of TDP- 43 inclusions involves cellular translocation and conversion of TDP- 43 into fibrillogenic forms, but the ability of these accumulations to sequester normal TDP- 43 and propagate this behavior between neurons pathologically is mostly inferred. The lack of methodology to produce soluble full length TDP- 43 and recapitulate this polymerization into filaments as observed in disease has limited our understanding of these pathogenic cascades. The protocols described here generate soluble, full-length and untagged TDP- 43 allowing for a direct assessment of the impact of various posttranslational modifications on TDP- 43 function. We demonstrate that Casein Kinase II (CKII) promotes the polymerization of this soluble TDP- 43 into 10 nm diameter filaments that resemble the most common TDP- 43 structures observed in disease. Furthermore, these filaments are recognized as abnormal by Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) which can inhibit TDP- 43 polymerization or directly promote TDP- 43 filament depolymerization. These findings demonstrate CKII induces polymerization of soluble TDP- 43 into filaments and Hsp 90 promotes TDP- 43 filament depolymerization. These findings provide rational for potential therapeutic intervention at these points in TDP- 43 proteinopathies...|$|R

40|$|The 110 K-calmodulin complex {{isolated}} from intestinal microvilli is an ATPase consisting of one polypeptide chain of 110 kD {{in association with}} three to four calmodulin molecules. This complex is presumably {{the link between the}} actin filaments in the microvillar core and the surrounding cell membrane. To study its structural regions, we have partially cleaved the 110 K-calmodulin complex with alpha-chymotrypsin; calmodulin remains essentially intact under the conditions used. As determined by 125 I-calmodulin overlays, ion exchange chromatography, and actin-binding assays, a 90 -kD digest fragment generated in EGTA remains associated with calmodulin. The 90 K-calmodulin complex binds actin in an ATP-reversible manner and decorates actin filaments with an arrow-head appearance similar to that found after incubation of F-actin with the parent complex; binding occurs in either calcium- or EGTA- containing buffers. ATPase activity of the 90 -kD digest closely resembles the parent complex. In calcium a digest mixture containing fragments of 78 kD, a group of three at approximately 40 kD, and a 32 - kD fragment (78 -kD digest mixture) is generated with alpha-chymotrypsin at a longer incubation time; no association of these fragments with calmodulin is observed. Time courses of digestions and cyanogen bromide cleavage indicate that the 78 -kD fragment derives from the 90 -kD peptide. The 78 -kD mixture can also hydrolyze ATP. Furthermore, removal of the calmodulin by ion exchange chromatography from this 78 -kD mixture had no effect on the ATPase activity of the digest, indicating that the ATPase activity resides on the 110 -kD polypeptide. The 78 kD, two of the three fragments at approximately 40 kD, and the 32 -kD fragments associate with F-actin in an ATP-reversible manner. Electron microscopy of actin filaments after incubation with the 78 -kD digest mixture reveals <b>coated</b> <b>filaments,</b> although the prominent arrowhead appearance characteristic of the parent complex is not observed. These data indicate that calmodulin is not required either for the ATPase activity or the ATP-reversible binding of the 110 K-calmodulin complex to F-actin. In addition, since all the fragments that bind F-actin do so in an ATP-reversible manner, the sites required for F-actin binding and ATP reversibility likely reside nearby...|$|R

It is not known if or what role des associated proteins play within the aggregation process of mutant des. We have systematically characterized the biochemical properties of both human syn-L and tail truncated nes {{as well as their}} interaction with des and vimentin (vim). After renaturation into buffers of low ionic strength, syn was determined to be a monomer, and it only formed oligomeric structures of distinct size under IF assembly conditions. A major topic of this thesis was to characterize its in vitro interaction with des and vim. Surprisingly, syn exhibited a strong negative impact on the filament forming process of des and vim, both when proteins were mixed before or after renaturation. The addition of syn to pre-assembled filaments caused the formation of globular protein structures within the filament network and at its ends. Employing domain- truncated variants of des and vim for assembly experiments of syn, we determined the rod domain of des and vim as binding site for syn. The study of the tail-truncated variant of nes revealed a significant pH-sensitive solubility. Aggregates formed by nes under assembly conditions seemed to be unordered. Nes interacted with des during renaturation but not afterwards. âUnit length filamentâ-like structures formed by mutant vimY 117 L and desY 122 L were covered by a proteinacous mass assembled in the presence of nes. No filaments but huge protein aggregates were visualized when nes was renaturated and co-assembled with des under assembly conditions, but addition of nes after renaturation of des caused the occasional decoration of seemingly intact des IFs with irregular protein structures. Addition of nes before or after renaturation of vim altered the size of protein aggregates found besides intact filaments. Our in vitro-data suggest that syn and nes are no bona fide IF proteins but IF-associated proteins. Because nes is only <b>coating</b> <b>filaments</b> and syn aggressively integrates into pre-existing IFs, and because both are not able to form IFs, the role of syn and nes as structural components in both normal and diseased muscle should be analysed now from a completely different point of view...|$|R
