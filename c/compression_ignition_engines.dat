2500|$|There {{has been}} {{research}} into <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engines</b> and {{the burning of}} diesel heavy fuel in rotaries using spark ignition. The basic design parameters of the Wankel engine preclude obtaining a compression ratio higher than 15:1 or 17:1 in a practical engine, but attempts are continuously being made to produce a compression-ignition Wankel. The Rolls-Royce and Yanmar compression-ignition [...] approach was to use a two-stage unit, with one rotor acting as compressor, while combustion {{takes place in the}} other. Conversion of an standard 294 cc per chamber spark-ignition unit to use heavy fuel was described in SAE paper 930682, by L. Louthan. SAE paper 930683, by D. Eiermann, resulted in the Wankel SuperTec line of compression-ignition rotary engines.|$|E

The purpose of this work was to provide a flexible thermodynamic model based on the filling-and-emptying approach for the performance prediction of a four-stroke turbocharged <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engine.</b> To validate the model, comparisons were made between results from a computer program developed using FORTRAN language and the commercial GT-Power software operating under different conditions. The comparisons showed that there was a good concurrence between the developed program and the commercial GT-Power software. We also stud-ied the influence of several engine parameters on brake power and effective efficiency. The range of variation of the rota-tional speed of the diesel engine chosen extended from 800 to 2100 rpm. By analyzing these parameters with regard to two optimal points in the engine, one relative to maximum power and another to maximum efficiency, it was found that if the injection timing is advanced, so the maximum levels of pressure and temperature in the cylinder are high...|$|R

The performance tests are carried out on a <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engine</b> using diesel, jatropha oil (unheated) and jatropha oil (preheated) as fuel. The effects of fuel injection pressure and fuel inlet temper-ature on the engine performance and emission for different fuels are also analyzed using this model.

50|$|Gasoline (spark ignition) {{versions}} are particularly useful in lightweight or portable {{applications such as}} chainsaws and motorcycles. However, when weight and size are not an issue, the cycle's potential for high thermodynamic efficiency makes it ideal for diesel <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engines</b> operating in large, weight-insensitive applications, such as marine propulsion, railway locomotives and electricity generation. In a two-stroke engine, the heat transfer from the engine to the cooling system is less than in a four-stroke, which means that two-stroke engines can be more efficient.|$|E
50|$|Ignition {{occurs as}} the {{temperature}} of the fuel/air mixture is taken over its autoignition temperature, due to heat generated by the compression of the air during the compression stroke. The vast majority of <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engines</b> are diesels in which the fuel is mixed with the air after the air has reached ignition temperature. In this case, the timing comes from the fuel injection system. Very small model engines for which simplicity and light weight is more important than fuel costs use easily ignited fuels (a mixture of kerosene, ether, and lubricant) and adjustable compression to control ignition timing for starting and running.|$|E
50|$|The {{cylinder}} head {{is not required}} to host valves, allowing the spark plug to be placed in the best possible location for efficient ignition of the combustion mixture. For very big engines, where flame propagation speed limits both size and speed, the swirl induced by ports, as described by Harry Ricardo can be an additional advantage. In his research with two-stroke single sleeve valve <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engines,</b> Harry Ricardo proved that an open sleeve was feasible, acting as a second annular piston with 10% of the central piston area, that transmitted 3% of the power to the output shaft through the sleeve driving mechanism. This highly simplifies construction, as the 'junk head' is no longer needed.|$|E
