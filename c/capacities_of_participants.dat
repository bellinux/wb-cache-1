40|$|We have {{proposed}} elsewhere an alternative analytical framework for project evaluation and a criterion of ‘human autonomy effectiveness’ {{to examine the}} effects of aid projects on the lives, opportunities and <b>capacities</b> <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> (Muñiz Castillo & Gasper, 2009). A project is human-autonomy effective when it promotes an expansion of individual autonomy that allows people to support and sustain their own development, in a way that does not constrain other priority capabilities. In this paper, we explore how four aid projects influenced the autonomy of local participants, by examining their project logic. We elicit key assumptions behind the projects’ design and implementation; identify significant project practices (forms of interaction and practical strategies); and analyse the practices’ possible influence on the participants’ autonomy. The paper shows that we need to understand the project logic in a deeper way than through the conventional ‘logical framework’ approach. Power relations between project stakeholders are crucial elements of the actual practices that influence the access to resources as result of the projects. Moreover, practices such as top-down design or excessive conditionality could harm participants’ autonomy despite being supportive to other goals, and thus have negative longer-run significance. When project practices constrain the opportunities and perceived competence of individuals to help themselves, the ‘development’ or change promoted by those projects is not sustainable (Ellerman, 2006) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In hitting, {{performers}} {{are found}} {{to adapt to the}} approach speed of the ball, i. e. they tend to initiate their movement at a shorter time before contact for faster approaching balls. A change in movement time is always accompanied by a change in movement velocity when the movement trajectory is kept constant. Hence, a fast-approaching ball might induce high impact velocity that is in conflict with low impact constraints, such as propelling the ball towards a near goal. In this study we investigated the <b>capacities</b> <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> to perform one-dimensional hitting movements in the frontal plane to balls approach-ing on a head-on collision course. The temporal precision (i. e. ball approach speed: 1, 1. 5, and 2 m/s) and impact requirements (i. e. No-Goal, Near-Goal, and Far-Goal) were manipulated to examine the influence of task constraints on the temporal regulation of a stroke. The results showed that timing and speed were significantly affected by ball approach speed when the hit was not directed to a goal. In contrast, no speed-coupling and a constant time-to-impact strategy were found when impact velocity was constrained (i. e. aiming for a near goal). We were particularly interested in the nature and relation of information sources and timing patterns of movement initiation. Therefore, the relation between the time evolu-tion of three optical sources related to the approach of the ball and the observed patterns of swing onset were evaluated quantitatively. The analyses revealed that a viable explanation for the two observed qualitatively different onset patterns of the swing is a regulation based on the absolute rate of expansion or a co-varying variable. The flexible adaptation of timing to impact constraints may be realized by an adjustment of the critical region of this optical variable...|$|E
40|$|Considering the {{ecological}} {{crisis and the}} increased disconnection between human beings and nature, this study attempts to find the social and aesthetic educational response needed for developing ecological citizenship for the 21 st century. In this transdisciplinary study I articulate what at first seems a clumsy attempt to enable the capacities of the embodied ecological citizen, and which later emerges as an alchemical ‘social sculpture’ approach to learning that expands the range of capacities available to the citizen and the citizen’s immediate community. This learning bridges the gap between purely biocentric and technocentric forms of education, and addresses the ambiguity of concepts and forms of action such as ‘sustainability’. My primary focus is enabling both communal and personal forms of agency: new ways of 'doing’ and 'being' {{in the world as}} it changes radically. I argue that this demands constantly reflecting on and engaging without understanding, place and perception of the problems we see. Attending to a call for the importance of complex learning processes, that deepens our understanding of sustainability, and the need for methodological and pedagogical approaches to accessible forms of learning socially in the era of climate change and environmental degradation, this study offers a particular insight into the education of an ecological citizen. In particular I examine a form of learning that enables individuals to explore relationships between themselves and their ecologies (both physical and social), and that encourages personal forms of knowing so that each person’s values can be cultivated within the experience and intuitive expression from both inner and outer realities. Central to my research focus is addressing the difficulties inherent in ‘ecological apartheid’, which is defined as a growing separation of relationships that include the human being’s relationship with the natural world, as well as disconnections experienced within one’s own inner and outer capacities. Subsequently I investigate forms of learning that encourage agency that most appropriately enable citizens to respond personally to both inner and outer forms of disconnection. ‘Personal’ and ‘relational agency’ are defined and investigated through an initial twelve-month collaborative participatory contextual profiling exploratory research period in South Africa (phase A), where I explore various forms of multiple-genre creative social learning practice that develop an accessible set of methodologies and pedagogies for {{the ecological}} citizen. Through this exploratory research, I place significance in the relatively unknown field of social sculpture, which I investigate through a self-made apprenticeship with Shelley Sacks, an expert in the field. This is documented through a rigorous ethnographic inquiry over a period of 18 months. Following this I undertake another two-year collaborative, practice-based research study across South Africa (phase B: 17 towns, with a total of 350 citizens) and eventually abroad (United Kingdom, Germany, USA and Belgium). The focus of this study was the implementation of a collaboratively developed citizen learning practice entitled Earth Forum developed by Shelley Sacks as a progression from her work “Exchange Values: voices of insivible lives” and my collaboative exploration into Earth Forum and its further development draws heavily from social sculpture methods obtained during the apprenticeship, and applied in 36 different incidences. I further explore the efficacy of this practice in enabling and expanding the <b>capacities</b> <b>of</b> <b>participants,</b> particularly those that encourage the development of personal and relational agency. This was achieved through a pedagogical development and expansion period (phase C). A primary finding through the iterative phase (phase D) was the value of imaginal contemplation, attentive listening, and empathy as capacities that enable an ecological citizen’s overall capability. I ascribed this to Nussbaum and Sen’s (1993) capability theory and the need to enable the articulation and implementation of a citizen’s valued ‘beings and doings’. Through this iterative phase, specific attention is given to listening and intuitive capacities in enabling personal and relational agency, and specifically I observed the fundamental role of imagination in this form of learning. Particularly valuable for the educational contribution of this study is the pedagogical development of the Earth Forum practice that enables an accessible, socially constructed form of learning. This contributes specifically to exploring ‘how’ social learning is undertaken, and I argue that an aesthetic approach to learning is vital for the education of the ecological citizen. I carefully describe how one can conduct collaborative practice-based research that utilises creative connective practice in agency development. This collaborative approach, with regard to learning socially and capacity development for ecological citizenship (that focuses its attention on addressing ecological apartheid and separateness), is articulated through a multiple-genred text. I found that empathetic capacity in ecological citizen education is relatively unexplored, and within listening and as well in empathy theory, that the role of imagination in listening and empathy development, requires greater attention. I attempt to reveal how connective practice considers aesthetic form and shape in expanding capacities of human beings, and introduce novel expanded forms of developing pedagogies that encourage personal and relational agency in the context of ecological apartheid from the artsbased field of social sculpture. Finally, I aim in this study to share the potential value found in social sculpture theory and practice into the field of environmental education and social learning through a reflection on the current context of education and social learning, and its potential enrichment via social sculpture processes...|$|E

40|$|Cognitive {{theories}} claim, whereas non-cognitive theories deny, that cognitive {{access is}} constitutive of phenomenology.

However, that area is strongly deactivated during sleep; a period when we entertain conscious experiences: dreams. This approach also avoids the classic objection that consciousness should be inextricably tied to reportability or it would fall outside the realm of science...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} distortions in labor supply choices that are {{induced by the}} {{recovery}} policies of pension funds. Pension funds recover from funding shortfalls and surpluses by making adjustments in the contribution rate charged to participants and/or adjusting the value of pension accruals received by participants in return. Deviations between contribution and accrual rates imply that the pension fund levies a net tax or provides a net subsidy on the labor supply <b>of</b> its <b>participants.</b> The resulting distortions in labor supply choices cause labor earnings to become more positively correlated to stock returns, thereby reducing the risk-bearing <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>participants.</b> Recovery policies prevent pension funds from taking optimal advantage of the risk premium in financial markets. Labor supply distortions are eliminated if financial gains and losses are levied upon participants through lump-sum transfers, rather than through transfers that are proportional to labor supply.

40|$|Expansive {{learning}} A {{central concern}} {{of our work}} is the conceptualisation of expansive learning (Leont’ev, 1978; Engeström, 1987). In this we have drawn primarily from the version of activity theory developed by Engeström (1987, 1989, 1991, 2001), which is detailed in Leadbetter (2006) and Daniels and Warmington (2007). By expansive learning we mean the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> in an activity to interpret and expand {{the definition of the}} object of activity and respond to it in increasingly enriched ways. For practitioners in our research sites such learning is evidenced in enhanced analyses of the potential of the education and/or care trajectory of the young person, and <b>of</b> their own <b>capacities</b> for professional action.

40|$|The {{absorptive}} <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> organisations {{is one of}} the key {{drivers of}} innovation performance in any industry. This research seeks to refine our understanding of the relationship between absorptive capacity and innovation performance, with a focus on characterising the absorptive <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> the different <b>participant</b> groups within the Australian road industry supply chain. One of the largest and most comprehensive surveys ever undertaken of innovation in road construction was completed in 2011 by the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), based on the Australian road industry. The survey of over 200 construction industry participants covered four sectors, comprising suppliers (manufacturers and distributors), consultants (engineering consultants), contractors (head and subcontractors) and clients (state government road agencies). The survey measured the absorptive capacity and innovation activity exhibited by organisations within each <b>of</b> these <b>participant</b> groups, using the perceived importance of addressing innovation obstacles as a proxy for innovation activity. One of the key findings of the survey is about the impact <b>of</b> <b>participant</b> competency on product innovation activity. The survey found that the absorptive <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> industry <b>participants</b> had a significant and positive relationship with innovation activity. Regarding the distribution <b>of</b> absorptive <b>capacity,</b> the results indicate that suppliers are more likely to have high levels <b>of</b> absorptive <b>capacity</b> than the other participant groups, with 32 % of suppliers showing high absorptive <b>capacity,</b> ahead <b>of</b> contractors (18 %), consultants (11 %), and clients (7 %).

Information obtained from participants were analysed thematically. The results established that, the disadvantaged communities did not find their participation to be meaningful because their expectations have not yet been met. The reliance on community organizations also excluded the majority of the population since these organizations did not interact with the community, hence not serving as intermediaries.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the ability of}} payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs {{to operate in the}} context of dynamic and complex social–ecological systems. Drawing on the experiences of two different PES programs in Latin America, we examine how PES institutions fit with the tenets of adaptive decision-making for sustainable resource management. We identify how the program goals and the connection to the market influence the incentive structure, information gathering, learning and feedback processes, and the structure of decision-making rights, specifically the ability to make and modify resource-use rules. Although limited in their generalizability, findings from the two case studies suggest a tension between the contractual model of PES and adaptive decision-making in natural resource systems. PES programs are not inherently decentralized, flexible management tools, as PES contracts tend to restrict decision-making rights and offer minimal flexibility mechanisms to change resource-use practices over the duration of the contract period. Furthermore, PES design and flexibility is heavily dependent on the goals and mission of the buyer and the respective market. If PES is to facilitate sustainable resource management, greater attention is needed to assess how the institutional design of the PES contracts influence the motivation and <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> and program officers alike to adaptively manage the respective resource systems.
