50|$|<b>Conical</b> <b>scanning</b> is not {{considered}} to be a form of monopulse radar, but the following summary provides background that can aid understanding.|$|R

50|$|W端rzburg D Replaced {{the model}} C in {{production}} in 1942. It {{now had a}} usable range of approximately 40 km. <b>Conical</b> <b>scan</b> was used for fine accuracy. The IFF antenna was now fitted {{in the center of}} the dish rather than on the sides. Better instruments were fitted and generally it was the best of the small W端rzburg.|$|E
50|$|The SCR-268 {{was not a}} {{particularly}} advanced design {{by the standards of}} the era. Early units were technically behind the times in terms of tracking in particular; while the SCR-268 was being introduced, the Germans were upgrading the W端rzburg radar, first to use lobe switching, and finally to <b>conical</b> <b>scan</b> the next year. These sorts of changes were simply not possible on the SCR-268 due to its long wavelength, which demanded a non-circular antenna.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Conical</b> <b>scanning</b> concept. The {{radar beam}} is rotated {{in a small}} circle around the [...] "boresight" [...] axis, which is pointed at the target.|$|R
50|$|<b>Conical</b> <b>scanning</b> {{was similar}} in concept to lobe switching, {{but as the}} name implies it was {{operated}} in a rotary fashion instead of two directions. This allowed the operator to get a 2-D view of which direction had the strongest return, and was much easier to operate as a result. However, <b>conical</b> <b>scanning</b> could only easily be used on an antenna with a single feed horn, which is only practical with microwave radars. As such systems were introduced into service, lobe switching generally disappeared.|$|R
50|$|Introduced in {{the early}} 1950s, the MK 68 was an upgrade from the MK 37 {{effective}} against air and surface targets. It combined a manned topside director, a <b>conical</b> <b>scan</b> acquisition and tracking radar, an analog computer to compute ballistics solutions, and a gyro stabilization unit.The gun director was mounted in a large yoke, and the whole director was stabilized in crosslevel (the yoke's pivot axis). That axis was in a vertical plane that included the line of sight.|$|E
50|$|If the lobes {{are closely}} spaced, this signal {{can produce a}} high degree of {{pointing}} accuracy within the beam, adding to the natural accuracy of the conical scanning system. Whereas classical <b>conical</b> <b>scan</b> systems generate pointing accuracy on the order of 0.1 degree, monopulse radars generally improve this by a factor of 10, and advanced tracking radars like the AN/FPS-16 are accurate to 0.006 degrees. This is an accuracy of about 10 m at a distance of 100 km.|$|E
50|$|Mounted on the trailer-base of the 34mm cannon Flab 38, {{the target}} {{tracking}} and illumination radar has a three-axis alignment {{system for the}} tracking antenna and the guiding beacon, it can precisely track overhead targets. The missile guides itself {{to the center of}} guiding beam. It was manufactured by Contraves AG and the BBC. Target tracking system with <b>Conical</b> <b>Scan</b> Radar and guidiance beam. Rotating beacon with primary radiator without reflector. Electronic driven three directional axes.|$|E
50|$|Monopulse radar is a {{radar system}} that compares the {{received}} signal {{from a single}} radar pulse against itself in order to compare the signal as seen in multiple directions, polarizations, or other differences. The most common form is an adaptation of <b>conical</b> <b>scanning</b> radar which compares the return from two directions to directly measure {{the location of the}} target. This avoids problems in decoding conventional <b>conical</b> <b>scanning</b> systems, which can be confused by rapid changes in signal strength. The system also makes jamming more difficult. Most radars designed since the 1960s are monopulse systems.|$|R
50|$|In {{some cases}} the antenna may be {{designed}} to create a squint. For example, an antenna {{which is used to}} communicate with a satellite but must remain in a vertical configuration. Squint is also required in <b>conical</b> <b>scanning.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Conical</b> <b>scanning</b> {{addresses}} {{this problem}} by [...] "moving" [...] the radar beam slightly off center from the antenna's midline, and then rotating it. Given an example antenna that generates a beam of 2 degrees width [...] - [...] fairly typical [...] - [...] a <b>conical</b> <b>scanning</b> radar might move the beam 1.5 degrees {{to one side of}} the centerline by offsetting the feed slightly. The resulting pattern, at any one instant in time, covers the midline of the antenna for about 0.5 degrees, and 1.5 degrees to the side. By spinning the feed horn with a motor, the pattern becomes a cone centered on the midline, extending 3 degrees to the sides in our example.|$|R
50|$|<b>Conical</b> <b>scan</b> and {{monopulse}} antennas {{are susceptible}} to interference from weather phenomenon and stationary objects. The resulting interference can produce feedback signals that move the antenna beam away from the aircraft. This can produce an unreliable antenna position when the antenna is aimed too near the ground or too near to heavy weather. Systems with no Pulse Doppler tracking mode may remain aimed at irrelevant objects like trees or clouds. Constant operator attention is required {{when there is no}} Doppler signal processing.|$|E
5000|$|The AN/TSQ-96 {{operated}} in India Band monopulse {{variant of the}} <b>conical</b> <b>scan</b> Reeves AN/MSQ-77 Bomb Directing Central and had a solid state Univac 1219B computer with punch tape reader (Mark 152 fire control computer), [...] for ballistic calculation. As with the MSQ-77, an analog vacuum tube computer converted radar range, azimuth, and elevation to cartesian coordinates, but the TSQ-96 used a digital radiometer for analog-to-digital conversion. The TSQ-96 systems manufactured by Reeves Instrument Corporation were replaced [...] by the US Dynamics AN/TPQ-43 Radar Bomb Scoring Set ("Seek Score").|$|E
5000|$|Similar to the USMC's post-WWII AN/TPQ-2 and Korean War AN/MPQ-14, the AN/MSQ-51 used a 38 ft Operations Trailer, a 30.6 ft {{flatbed trailer}} with Electric Generator units, and a 19.2 ft Maintenance Trailer. An {{additional}} flatbed {{was used for}} transporting the 2343 lb acquisition (surveillance) antenna assembly which included a 16' oblong dish and a ground pedestal.

50|$|It is {{possible}} to arrange a radar so the lobes are not being moved in the broadcaster, only the receiver. To do this, one adds a second antenna with the rotating lobe for reception only, a system known as COSRO, for <b>Conical</b> <b>Scan</b> on Receive Only (compare to LORO, a similar system used against lobe switching radars). Although this denied lobing frequency information to the jammer in the aircraft, it was still possible to simply send out random spikes and thereby confuse the tracking system (or operator). This technique, called SSW for Swept Square Wave, doesn't protect the aircraft with {{the same sort of}} effectiveness as inverse gain, but is better than nothing and often fairly effective.|$|E
50|$|<b>Conical</b> <b>scan</b> systems {{send out}} a signal {{slightly}} {{to one side of}} the antenna's boresight, and then rotating the feed horn to make the lobe rotate around the boresight line. A target centered on the boresight is always slightly illuminated by the lobe, and provides a strong return. If the target is to one side, it will be illuminated only when the lobe is pointed in that general direction, resulting in a weaker signal overall (or a flashing one if the rotation is slow enough). This varying signal will reach a maximum when the antenna is rotated so it is aligned in the direction of the target, by looking for this maximum and moving the antenna in that direction, a target can be automatically tracked.|$|E
50|$|Infrared missile seekers of {{the first}} {{generation}} typically used a spinning reticle with a pattern on it that modulates infrared energy before it falls on a detector (A mode of operation called Spin scan). The patterns used differ from seeker to seeker, but the principle is the same. By modulating the signal, the steering logic can tell where the infrared source of energy is relative to the missile direction of flight. In more recent designs the missile optics will rotate and the rotating image is projected on a stationary reticle (a mode called <b>Conical</b> <b>scan)</b> or stationary set of detectors which generates a pulsed signal which is processed by the tracking logic.Most shoulder-launched (MANPADS) systems use this type of seeker, as do many air defense systems and air-to-air missiles (for example the AIM-9L).|$|E
50|$|German W端rzburg radar was {{susceptible}} to Window attack. The short wavelength allowed {{the use of}} short strips which fell only slowly, giving the cloud a long dispersion time.
