40|$|Public and Government {{concern about}} {{environmental}} pollution {{and the high}} price of petroleum products have forced the development of alternative fuels for automotive applications. Biodiesel is one of the alternative fuels which can be produced from vegetable oils (either pure or waste) or animal fats. Since biodiesel has properties similar to diesel, it can be substituted for the latter with little or no engine modification. Also, its use can reduce the engine emissions. In this study, biodiesel is produced from waste vegetable oil using Fuel Pod 2 ™ system. The chemical <b>catalists</b> used were methanol and Sodium hydroxide. The production process yielded 87 % biodiesel with the remaining being glycerin and soap. The biodiesel production cost was evaluated considering the chemical costs, running costs, waste oil collection costs, etc. The biodiesel price was found to be about 60 pence per litre which is nearly half of the petro-diesel price. A Ford Puma 2. 4 litre diesel engine was used to investigate the effects of petro-diesel/biodiesel blends on the performance and emissions of the diesel engine. Petro-diesel and biodiesel (B 100) fuels was tested in addition to three blends B 10 (10 % biodiesel and 90 % petro-diesel), B 15 and B 20. The engine load varied as 25, 50, 75, and 100 % full load. Also, the engine speed varied as 1500, 2200, 2600, 3000 and 3300 rpm. At these conditions, the engine torque, fuel consumption and emissions were measured. Accordingly, the performance parameters were evaluated such as engine power, specific fuel consumption and engine efficiency. The monitored exhaust emission included carbon dioxide (CO 2), carbon monoxide (CO), total unburned hydrocarbons (THC), and nitric oxides (NOx) ...|$|R
40|$|Esta tese se insere no contexto da química prebiótica, que estuda a evolução química que ocorreu antes do surgimento da vida na Terra. Tal área pertence ao ramo de pesquisa da Astrobiologia, que estuda o surgimento, a evolução, distribuição e futuro da vida na Terra ou em outro lugar do Universo. Dentre as várias hipóteses abordadas na química prebiótica, a hipótese mineral é foco de estudo deste trabalho, ou seja, se os minerais podem ter agido como preconcentradores ou protetores de moléculas biologicamente relevantes para a química prebiótica e como catalisadores de reações. A classe mineral de hidróxidos duplo lamelares (HDL) é estudada inicialmente considerando se sua síntese seria possível em um ambiente prebiótico. Desta forma, o HDL foi sintetizado por dois métodos de síntese (coprecipitação e reconstrução) e em quatro composições distintas de água do mar sintética, que mimetizam diferentes fases geológicas da Terra, os resultados mostraram a formação deste mineral em todas as composições de água do mar analisadas. Posteriormente, o estudo da interação de biomoléculas com HDL foi feito visando caracterizar se estas poderiam estar inseridas no espaço interlamelar deste mineral. O íon tiocianato, {{precursor}} de biomoléculas, e as bases nitrogenadas adenina, timina, e uracila mostraram-se presentes nas amostras de HDL sintetizadas pelos dois métodos, coprecipitação e reconstrução. As amostras foram caracterizadas por difratometria de raios X, análise termogravimétrica, análise elementar e por espectroscopia vibracional, Raman e no infravermelho. Embora os resultados iniciais indiquem que as biomoléculas possam estar interagindo com o mineral por adsorção e não necessariamente estejam intercaladas, estudos com lavagem das amostras com carbonato de sódio mostraram a troca iônica das biomoléculas pelo ânion inorgânico e sugerem que estas encontravam-se realmente no espaço interlamelar do mineral. Foram feitas então simulações de ambientes extremos nos sistemas HDL + biomoléculas para avaliar se a presença do mineral aumenta a estabilidade das biomoléculas frente a aquecimento, radiação UVC e radiação ionizante já que tais condições extremas estariam presentes na Terra primitivaThis thesis {{subject is}} related to prebiotic chemistry, which studies the chemical evolution that happened before {{the origin of life}} on Earth. This subject belongs to the Astrobiology research area, which studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life on Earth and elsewhere in the Universe. Among the many hypothesis that prebiotic chemistry encompass, the mineral hypothesis is the aim of this thesis, that is, if minerals could have had a role in preconcentrating and protecting molecules relevant to prebiotic chemistry, and also if they could have acted as <b>catalists.</b> The layered double hydroxide (LDH) minerals are studied and the first question is if they could have been synthetized in a prebiotic environment. Four different seawater compositions are analyzed, considering many geological periods of Earth, and two synthesis methods were studied: coprecipitation and reconstruction. The results showed that the LDHs are formed in all seawater types studied. Following these studies, we discuss whether biomolecules could be in the interlayer space of this mineral. Thiocyanate, a biomolecule precursor, and the nucleic acids adenine, thymine and uracil were present in the LDH samples synthetized either by coprecipitation and reconstruction, and they were characterized by X-Ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, elemental analysis and by vibrational spectroscopy: IR and Raman. Although the preliminary results showed that the biomolecules are not necessarily intercalated, but may simply be adsorbed on the minerals, after washing with a sodium carbonate solution, the biomolecules were replaced by the inorganic anion, suggesting that the former was in fact intercalated in the mineral. Extreme conditions simulations were then performed on the LDH plus biomolecules systems to evaluate whether the mineral may act as a protector and stabilize the biomolecules when these were heated or irradiated with UV-C and ionizing radiation, since such scenarios would be common on early Eart...|$|R
