50|$|The {{female part}} of the {{connector}} is the 7 * 7 * 4+1/2 in <b>corner</b> <b>casting,</b> which is fitted to the container itself, and has no moving parts, only an oval hole in the bottom. The hole is an oval 4.9 in on the long axis with two flat sides 2.5 in apart. The male component is the twistlock, which is fitted to cranes and transport bases. This can be inserted through the hole (it is roughly 4.1 in long and 2.2 in wide), and then the top portion (normally pointed to make insertion easier) is rotated 90° so that it cannot be withdrawn. The mechanism {{is similar to that}} of a Kensington lock, but on a much larger scale. The maximum size and position of the holes in the connector is defined in international standard ISO 1161:1984. The tensile strength of a twistlock is rated at either 20 or 25 tonnes.|$|E
5000|$|Keith Walton Tantlinger (March 22, 1919 - August 27, 2011) was a {{mechanical}} engineer and inventor. As Vice President of Engineering at the Fruehauf Trailer Corporation his inventions {{played a major role}} in containerization. [...] Working with a Fruehauf customer, Malcom McLean, they spearheaded the container ship revolution in the 1950s, Tantlinger developed much of the early technology that made modern container shipping possible while at Fruehauf. After its initial order of containers from Brown Trailer, Sea-Land switched to containers made by the Strick division of the Fruehauf Trailer Company. Fruehauf had been one of the dominant players in building truck bodies and trailers for a long time, and, as already described, had previously innovated in the design and construction of the early commercial semi-trailers. President Roy Fruehauf was impressed with the idea of containerization, so in addition to manufacturing containers for Sea-Land his company agreed to make the trailer chassis that were needed, and also to provide financing to Sea-Land for the purchase of these containers and chassis. In 1958 Tantlinger left Sea-Land and became chief engineer at Fruehauf, where he continued to work with containers. More importantly, over the years he played a key role in the process of container standardization, working extensively on a committee of the American Standards Association (ASA) and later being critically involved with the ISO’s efforts. His designs included the <b>corner</b> <b>casting</b> and Twistlock systems found on every intermodal container, the spreader bar for automatic securing of containers lifted on and off ships, and the ship-shore container transfer apparatus for the first cellular container ship. In the course of his professional career, Tantlinger was granted 79 United States patents, all related to transportation equipment. Many of his patents related to commercial highway freight trailers and transit buses.|$|E
40|$|Even with {{travelling}} speeds below 200 km/h, typical {{features of}} freight trains, {{such as the}} poor aerodynamic performances due to wide and squared surfaces or the presence of empty vehicles alternate to loaded ones, can remarkably worsen the effects of interaction with wind. Aim {{of the work is}} to highlight the worst compositions in terms of rollover risk, taking also into account the interaction between the flat-wagon and the container, provided by the twistlock – <b>corner</b> <b>casting</b> connection. Aerodynamic coefficients on both the flat-wagon and the container are measured by means of wind tunnel tests on scaled models. A mathematical model of a single freight wagon is then used to investigate the interaction between the wagon and the turbulent wind and finally determine the Characteristics Wind Curves for the most critical train-set compositions...|$|E

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} method of {{locating}} and recognizing lockholes in shipping container corner castings. This method converts the original image of the containers captured by a camera into the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space. To reduce {{the influence of the}} surface color of the containers and lights from the environment on the locating and recognizing algorithm, most noisy points of the image are filtered by binarization and a morphology opening operation to make the features of the containers clearer in the image. Thus, the container body can be separated from the total image. Then, the position and size of the corner castings are defined through calculation based on the international standard of the shipping container size. Lastly, by using this method, we can locate the <b>corner</b> <b>casting</b> in the image by using the General Hough Transform fitting algorithm onto ellipses...|$|E

It contained 73 electric lamps and had a spotlighton the top of one of the <b>corner</b> towers <b>casting</b> light onto the pavement below. The old part of the building was replaced by a new, circular concert hall, again with Brinkopff as the architect, which was inaugurated on 13 October 1893.In 1884, Hans Hansen went bankrupt and National Scala was taken over by a newly founded company. In the 1890s, the repertoire consisted mainly of theatre. The restaurant was called Euterpe.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The FDM {{numerical}} simulation software, View-Cast system, {{was employed to}} simulate the mould-filling and solidification process in {{low pressure die casting}} (LPDC) of Al-alloy motor enclosure. The distribution of liquid fraction, temperature field and the solidification pattern of casting were revealed and the formation mechanism as well as distribution rule of the potential defects, namely gas pores and shrinkage pores, were predicted. Furthermore the solutions to eliminate them were presented. By reducing the pouring rate, the turbulent flow at the <b>corner</b> of <b>casting</b> had eased, so the gas pores could be eliminated. Then the force-cooling system was installed on the top of mould, which could reduce the volume of liquid islands efficiently so that the shrinkage defects can be decreased to its limit...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Large {{mechanical}} components subjected to cyclic loading quite often spend a considerable {{part of their}} life in the propagation {{of one or more}} fatigue cracks. Therefore the knowledge of materials crack propagation behaviour under cyclic loading appears of considerable interest. During tests conducted for the determination of the classical S-N fatigue curves, useful information on crack growth can usually be collected and a reliable evaluation of the stress intensity factor can be realised. In this paper the results of fatigue tests performed on large cast irons specimens are discussed. During each test the crack initiation was detected and several crack propagation measurements were collected. On the basis of the weight function approach, using a solution proposed for the evaluation of the stress intensity factor (K) in case of corner cracks with elliptical front, DK values was calculated and correlated with the corresponding da/dN values, with the intent of determining the Paris laws for the studied material.

50|$|These {{minerals}} {{can react}} together to alter from one species to another, {{depending on the}} prevailing local environment, such as temperature, pressure and acidity. This is demonstrated by the prevalence of pseudomorphs and epimorphs in specimens from this mine. Epimorphs of quartz SiO2 after fluorite CaF2 are characteristic. These occur when quartz crystals grow {{on the surface of}} fluorite crystals, then the fluorite dissolves, leaving a cubic cast in the quartz. The cast could in theory be that of any isometric mineral but in 2005 a cube of fluorite was found re-growing in the <b>corner</b> of a <b>cast.</b> This crystal was in perfect alignment with the cast, indicating that both came from the same source, and the original mineral forming the cast was, indeed, fluorite.|$|R

40|$|A novel {{method for}} {{automated}} inspection of small <b>corner</b> cracks in <b>casted</b> steel is presented, using a photometric stereo setup {{consisting of two}} light sources of different colors {{in conjunction with a}} line-scan camera. The resulting image is separated into two different reflection patterns which are used to cancel shadow effects and estimate the surface gradient. Statistical methods are used to first segment the image and then provide an estimated crack probability for each segmented region. Results show that true cracks are successfully assigned a high crack probability, while only a minor proportion of other regions cause similar probability values. About 80 % of the cracks present in the segmented regions are given a crack probability higher than 70 %, while the corresponding number for other non-crack regions is only 5 %. The segmented regions contain over 70 % of the manually identified crack pixels. We thereby provide proof-of-concept for the presented method.

The objectives of the testing were to obtain information concerning the southern limits of the casting shed and to explore additional areas of the casting shed floor. Limestone piers exposed along the south wall line of the casting shed indicate that this wall line was not parallel to the north wall of the shed, and that a doorway or similar opening was present south and west of the furnace base.

A test pit in the west central area of the casting shed further exposed a brick footing partially uncovered during excavations in the shed in 1983. Structural similarities with a brick footing exposed in 1981 suggest the brick features were elements of a brick partition wall associated with a room in the northwest <b>corner</b> of the <b>casting</b> shed.
