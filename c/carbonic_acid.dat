Carbon can form anions such as C4− (methanide), C (acetylide) and C (sesquicarbide or allylenide), in compounds with metals of main groups 1–3, and with the lanthanides and actinides.

5|$|Charged {{particles}} have {{a considerable}} {{influence on the}} surface properties of Galilean moons. Plasma originating from Io carries sulfur and sodium ions farther from the planet, where they are implanted preferentially on the trailing hemispheres of Europa and Ganymede. On Callisto however, for unknown reasons, sulfur is concentrated on the leading hemisphere. Plasma may also be responsible for darkening the moons' trailing hemispheres (again, except Callisto's). Energetic electrons and ions, with the flux of the latter being more isotropic, bombard surface ice, sputtering atoms and molecules off and causing radiolysis of water and other chemical compounds. The energetic particles break water into oxygen and hydrogen, maintaining the thin oxygen atmospheres of the icy moons (since the hydrogen escapes more rapidly). The compounds produced radiolytically on the surfaces of Galilean moons also include ozone and hydrogen peroxide. If organics or carbonates are present, carbon dioxide, methanol and <b>carbonic</b> <b>acid</b> can be produced as well. In the presence of sulfur, likely products include sulfur dioxide, hydrogen disulfide and sulfuric acid. Oxidants produced by radiolysis, like oxygen and ozone, may be trapped inside the ice and carried downward to the oceans over geologic time intervals, thus serving as a possible energy source for life.|$|E

However, in 1991 scientists at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (USA) succeeded in making solid H2CO3 samples.

The <b>carbonic</b> <b>acid</b> that remained was characterized by infrared spectroscopy. The fact that the <b>carbonic</b> <b>acid</b> was prepared by irradiating a solid H2O + CO2 mixture, or even by irradiation of dry ice alone, {{has given rise to}} suggestions that H2CO3 might be found in outer space or on Mars, where frozen ices of H2O and CO2 are found, as well as cosmic rays. It was announced in 1993 that solid <b>carbonic</b> <b>acid</b> had been created by a cryogenic reaction of potassium bicarbonate and HCl dissolved in methanol. Later work showed that in fact the methyl ester had been formed, but other methods were successful. Theoretical calculations showed that a single molecule of water can catalyze the decomposition of a gas-phase <b>carbonic</b> <b>acid</b> molecule to carbon dioxide and water. In the absence of water, the dissociation of gaseous <b>carbonic</b> <b>acid</b> has been predicted to be very slow, with a half-life of 180,000 years.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} hemocompatibility and cytotoxicity properties of synthetic polymer coatings containing various unsaturated <b>carbonic</b> <b>acids</b> with vinylacetate. Co-polymers of vinylacetate and crotonic acid (CA), maleic acid (MA), and itaconic acid (IA) were made. The materials were characterized in terms of their adhesion to metal supports (titanium and stainless steel) as well as hemocompatibility (% hemolysis, wettability, erythrocyte aggregation, hemoglobin content, thrombocyte count and lipid peroxidation levels) and cytotoxicity (human endothelial cell activity in vitro and chromosome aberrations, bone marrow proliferation and cell ploidy in rats). Co-polymers of unsaturated <b>carbonic</b> <b>acids</b> with vinylacetate exhibited good hemocompatibility properties, as opposed to vinylacetate homopolymer for which substantial levels of hemolysis were observed. By coating the metal supports with co-polymers the cytotoxic effects associated with the bare metal samples were markedly reduced. MA samples showed excellent hemocompatibility and no cytotoxicity, yet they lacked good adhesion properties to metal substrate, probably due to high water content. CA samples, having the highest density of carboxylic groups among the samples under investigation, showed increased bone marrow proliferation activity and cell ploidy in rats, as compared to controls. The most promising results in the present study were obtained for the samples with IA, which showed good adhesion to metal substrates, good hemocompatibility and low cytotoxicity. Thus, co-polymers of vinylacetate and IA rich in carboxylic groups are promising materials for the design of novel drug-eluting stents...|$|R
40|$|Proton {{balance is}} {{analysed}} {{in relation to}} the anaerobic and aerobic metabolism of carbohydrates, <b>carbonic</b> <b>acids,</b> amino acids and fat by considering oxidation, carboxylation, decarboxylation and phosphorylation reactions, as well as the influence of ammonium, on the acid—base status of animal tissues. The functional role of the adenylates, phosphagens and inorganic phosphate in acid-base balance is investigated with respect to differences in the physicochemical properties of organic and inorganic phosphates. General principles are established for different anaerobic metabolic pathways in species from several phyla. It is concluded that proton release from the substrate, which is always involved in substrate-level phosphorylations, is essential for the mechanism of ATP formation. Anaerobic metabolism, which is characterized by incomplete oxidation of carbon chains and an accumulation of acidic groups, supports pH regulation in facultative anaerobes by minimizing the amount of accumulated protons. High levels of phosphagens mean high proton absorption during hydrolysis and an increase in the intracellular buffer value. Decarboxylation reactions in catabolic pathways are equivalent to proton consumption. The degradation of <b>carbonic</b> <b>acids</b> during anaerobiosis, therefore, contributes to pH regulation. Release of ammonia or ammonium ions in catabolism is also linked to the buffering of protons originating from the formation of carboxyl groups and net cleavage of ATP. Net disposal of amino groups or ammonium ions by transamin-ation, reductive amination or ion exchange does not change this general picture. The proton, bicarbonate and CO 2 turnover in metabolic pathways is discussed with respect to the interrelationships between pH and metabolic regulation...|$|R

Also the diffusive mechanism is confirmed by direct dependence of maximum diffusive current of electro-oxidation of <b>carbonic</b> <b>acids</b> as a function of concentration of solutions. The authors of the article explored dependence of the maximum current as a function of molecular mass of acid and have shown, that with the growth of molecular mass the maximum current decreases, the phenomena is explained by reduction in the same sequence the diffusion coefficient.
