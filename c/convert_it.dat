5|$|Beth Israel's {{original}} {{building in}} Downtown Phoenix, constructed in 1921–1922, is listed {{on both the}} city’s historic property register and the National Register of Historic Places.

5|$|A short {{distance}} to the south-west of the castle is a barracks block and associated storage buildings, constructed soon after 1718. Built to replace the original barrack accommodation within the castle when it was redeveloped to <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> into a magazine, it has changed little externally in the last 300 years. It is a rare surviving example of an 18th-century building of this type {{and was one of}} the first distinct barracks to be built in England.|$|E

5|$|After {{the sale}} the {{building}} was mainly used for storage whilst planning applications to <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> into a hotel were made in 1986, 1993, and 2001, {{with varying degrees of}} success. The coroner's court was the last to vacate the premises, in 1998. In 2001, {{the building was}} placed on English Heritage's Buildings at Risk Register.

The Red Cross also set up a shelter in Houma, where 14people stayed.|$|E
5|$|Dirge of Cerberus is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} third-person shooter. Battles occur in real-time, with the HUD displaying {{information such as}} Vincent's hit points and magic points, the currently selected item and quantity thereof, and a cross-hair to aid in targeting enemies. The action is viewed from an over-the-shoulder perspective similar to Resident Evil 4, although players can switch to a first-person perspective if they wish. Defeating enemies yields EXP, {{and at the end}} of each stage, the player can either use that EXP to level up, increasing Vincent's stats, or <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> to Gil (the in-game currency), which can then be used to purchase items and equipment upgrades.|$|E

Goldman {{continued}} to operate the building as rental apartments until 1982 when he formed a company, Manhattan Master Apartment Associates, to <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> to a housing co-operative. The conversion was completed in 1988 when that company transferred control to a new organization, Master Apartments, Inc.|$|E

The Home Office considered the protest to be in humour, though the chief constable responded to say the office could not act against a protected scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|In October 2010 Manchester City Council {{announced}} that it was in discussion with a developer to renovate the building and bring it back into use. In August 2013 the council received a planning application from the Church Converts (Manchester) to repair the building and <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> into apartments; the application was granted in February 2014. The redevelopment by CZero Developments consists of 73 private apartments in both the chapel and the Sunday school, with the redevelopment due to be completed by Summer 2017.

5|$|Instrumentalism {{became popular}} among {{physicists}} {{around the turn}} of the 20th century, after which logical positivism defined the field for several decades. Logical positivism accepts only testable statements as meaningful, rejects metaphysical interpretations, and embraces verificationism (a set of theories of knowledge that combines logicism, empiricism, and linguistics to ground philosophy on a basis consistent with examples from the empirical sciences). Seeking to overhaul all of philosophy and <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> to a new scientific philosophy, the Berlin Circle and the Vienna Circle propounded logical positivism in the late 1920s.|$|E
5|$|It is an {{important}} source of renewable energy and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> into solar power. Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems, concentrated solar power and solar water heating to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light-dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air.|$|E
5|$|Regularly {{travelling}} to London {{to visit}} friends, one notable comrade was Stuart Piggott, another influential British archaeologist who succeeded Childe as Abercromby Professor at Edinburgh. Another was Grahame Clark, whom Childe befriended and encouraged in his research. The trio were elected onto the {{committee of the}} Prehistoric Society of East Anglia. At Clark's suggestion, in 1935 they used their influence to <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> into a nationwide organisation, the Prehistoric Society, of which Childe was elected president. Membership of the group then grew rapidly; in 1935 it had 353 members, and this had increased to 668 in 1938.|$|E

5|$|Renewed {{tension between}} Britain and France in the 1840s {{led to a}} {{modernisation}} of some of Britain's coastal defences. The batteries at Shornemead and Coalhouse Point were reinstated and upgraded, though the one at Lower Hope Point was never restored. In {{the case of the}} Coalhouse battery, it was substantially expanded between 1847 and 1855 to <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> into a fort. The work was slow as the marshy ground caused the foundations to crack and the structure to subside, and the contractor was unsatisfactory.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} rebuilt between 1895 and 1896 to <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> from iron to steel. It was {{repeatedly}} reinforced throughout its existence. When Conrail closed the Wallkill Valley line in 1977, {{the stability of}} the trestle had been one of its primary reasons for doing so. Conrail had tried to sell the bridge as early as 1983, and in 1986 the trestle was sold to a private businessman, John Rahl, for one dollar.|$|E
5|$|The cellar of the {{building}} contained a barber's shop, a grocery store and a butcher shop. The remaining premises were used as apartments for rent.

In 1983, renovation works were started on {{the building}} to <b>convert</b> <b>it</b> into a hotel. Since {{the fall of the}} Soviet Union in 1991, various reconstruction works have been largely unsuccessful. As of 2009, the Castle of Richard the Lionheart still stands empty and fenced off in renovation.|$|E
