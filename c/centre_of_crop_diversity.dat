However, building on a series of qualitative interviews with key informants in three different communities, no evidence of social networks with the specific purpose of securing access to seed supply of local landraces was found. A number of different types of seed transactions were identified together with a number of different types of social relations involved in these transactions.

40|$|Abstract In this chapter, {{we develop}} new {{indicators}} and statistical tests to characterize patterns <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> <b>diversity</b> at local scales {{to better understand}} interactions between ecological and socio-cultural functions of agroecosystems. Farms, where a large number <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> (species or landraces) is grown, are known to contribute {{a large part of}} the locally available diversity of both rare and common crops but the role of farms with low diversity remains little understood: do they grow only common varieties—following a nestedness pattern typical of mutualistic networks in ecology—or do ‘crop–poor’ farmers also grow rare varieties? This question is pivotal in ongoing efforts to assess the local-scale contribution of small farms to global agrobiodiversity. We develop new network-based approaches to characterize the distribution <b>of</b> local <b>crop</b> <b>diversity</b> (species and infra-species) at the village level and to validate these approaches using meta-datasets from 10 countries. Our results highlight the sources <b>of</b> heterogeneity in <b>crop</b> <b>diversity</b> at the village level. We often identify two or more groups of farms based on their different levels of diversity. In some datasets, ‘crop–poor’ farms significantly contribute to the local <b>crop</b> <b>diversity.</b> Generally, we find that the distribution <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> <b>diversity</b> is more heterogeneous at the species than at the infra-species level. This analysis reveals the absence of a general pattern <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> <b>diversity</b> distribution, suggesting strong dependence on local agro-ecological and socio-cultural contexts.

To determine whether the relationship between increase of corn production and reduction <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> <b>diversity</b> {{and the proportion of}} cropland treated with insecticide found previously in the Midwestern states is universally applicable, we applied spatial panel model analysis to USDA Agricultural Census data for 1997, 2002, 2007, and 2012 using county-level data for the entire continental USA.

40|$|Exploring {{the role}} <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> <b>diversity</b> on the {{functioning}} of agroecosystems has significant implications for agriculture. ‘Pioneer farmers’, on Nicaragua’s agricultural frontier are adapting their cropping systems to new agroecological conditions including steep slopes, heavy rainfall and market inaccessibility which characterise the region. Farmers report that integration of a greater <b>diversity</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> has regenerated previously degraded land and improved performance of their agroecosystems. Working in partnership with Bioversity International and local NGOs in Waslala, the role <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> <b>diversity</b> on agroecosystem function was explored together with farmers in their fields, using a participatory joint learning approach. Results show that farmers in Waslala are managing highly diverse systems which enable year-around dietary diversity, food security and income stability. Farmers are using agroecological diversification practices which contribute to key agroecosystem functions such as pest and disease suppression, microclimate regulation and reducing soil erosion. Supporting theories from ecology, farmer’s experiences in Waslala suggest a link between agroecosystem diversity, productivity, stability and resilience. Opportunities to further enhance the use <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> <b>diversity</b> to overcome current and future challenges were also explored with farmers and local stakeholder and potential interventions identified. However, {{it is important to}} note that these interactions can be difficult to manage at a farm scale and negative interactions must be traded off with benefits. Diversification is not a solution to all problems for all farmers and some are seeking other strategies. Through joint exploration this study has shed new light on the link between <b>crop</b> <b>diversity</b> and agroecosystem function and led to the co-production of new knowledge. Reflection on this process highlights important considerations for future development of more engaged research processes. As farmers in other parts of the world are facing increasing challenges, experiences in Waslala suggest that agroecological diversification could be a viable option to increase productivity, stability and resilience in the face of change...|$|R

40|$|An {{in-depth}} {{analysis of the}} spatio-temporal evolution <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> <b>diversity</b> in agricultural landscapes is necessary to provide insights {{on how to improve}} the resilience of agroecosystems to climate instability and new pest pressures by increasing in situ <b>crop</b> <b>diversity,</b> while promoting a greater sustainability of agriculture. However, most of the indicators <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> <b>diversity</b> used in previous studies were based on ex situ genetic diversity, or on official lists of varieties or breeding programs, without taking acreage of the varieties actually grown in farmers' fields into account. Acreage of varieties represent however a relevant information to assess the actual genetic vulnerability <b>of</b> a <b>crop</b> (genetic uniformity at landscape scale) cultivated in the considered regions over the period studied. To bridge this gap, we analyzed spatial varietal and genetic diversity of bread wheat in France - an important production area - over the 1980 - 2006 period at a yearly time step and a district scale, i. e. 'departement'. We used H-T*, an indicator integrating both the spatial evenness of variety distribution and molecular genetic data, to finely examine the spatio-temporal evolution of spatially weighted bread wheat genetic diversity. We also computed several simpler and complementary indicators accounting for the number of varieties, the spatial varietal diversity and the genetic diversity, and we estimated the individual contribution of these simpler indicators to the spatio-temporal structure of the spatial genetic diversity H-T*. H-T* values showed significant but non linear temporal evolutions between 1980 and 2006, these evolutions being besides spatially structured. Moreover, both spatial varietal diversity and genetic diversity partly explained these temporal changes of H-T* values while the number of varieties appeared non-explanatory. Similarly to H-T*, all indicators studied also showed substantial differences of temporal changes among major French agricultural regions, furthermore sometimes opposite for varietal and genetic diversity. As an example, in the north of France, varietal richness and spatial varietal diversity showed a substantial increase, suggesting the adoption of an increasing number of bread wheat varieties by farmers in this region. However, considering that genetic diversity showed a slight but continuous decrease over the recent period, this could suggest an increase in genetic similarity among bread wheat varieties chosen by farmers. Taken as a whole, our results suggest that several determinants <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> <b>diversity,</b> such as the shortening <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> sequences or the recurrence of epidemics of some pathogens, could differentially affect varietal choices of farmers and thus the spatial structuration of the temporal changes <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> <b>diversity.</b> Finally, our results question the dominant use of ex situ nationwide datasets to characterize the evolution of spatial genetic diversity as a proxy of genetic vulnerability <b>of</b> a <b>crop</b> to face with future changes...|$|R

A social survey of 257 households on different aspects of seed management produced information on cultivar naming, seed sources, reasons and causes of the discontinuation of seed lots, and important explanatory variables associated with different seed sources. A small portion of the reported seed lots originated from regional seed sources. The main motivation of regional seed exchange and the discontinuation of seed lots was to achieve change in plant characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>crop,</b> especially to obtain lower plants and shorter growing cycles. It is argued that farmer selection fails to achieve such change, and in fact leads to an equilibrium with high plants and long growing cycles. Seed exchange functions as an escape to this trend. Other factors of influence on seed exchange are altitude and ethnicity. The study also highlights the issue of geographical directionality in seed exchange patterns...|$|R
