25|$|Blepharokeratoconjunctivitis is the {{combination}} of conjunctivitis with blepharitis and keratitis. It is clinically defined by changes of the lid margin, meibomian gland dysfunction, redness of the eye, conjunctival <b>chemosis</b> and inflammation of the cornea.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of cavernous sinus thrombosis is made clinically, with imaging studies {{to confirm the}} clinical impression. Proptosis, ptosis, <b>chemosis,</b> and cranial nerve palsy beginning in one eye and progressing to the other eye establish the diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Hypertrophy of the extraocular muscles, adipogenesis, and {{deposition}} of nonsulfated glycoaminoglycans and hyaluronate, causes {{expansion of the}} orbital fat and muscle compartments, which {{within the confines of}} the bony orbit may lead to dysthyroid optic neuropathy, increased intraocular pressures, proptosis, venous congestion leading to <b>chemosis</b> and periorbital edema, and progressive remodeling of the orbital walls. Other distinctive features of TAO include lid retraction, restrictive myopathy, superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis, and exposure keratopathy.|$|E
25|$|Ptosis, <b>chemosis,</b> {{cranial nerve}} palsies (III, IV, V, VI). Sixth nerve palsy {{is the most}} common. Sensory deficits of the {{ophthalmic}} and maxillary branch of the fifth nerve are common. Periorbital sensory loss and impaired corneal reflex may be noted. Papilledema, retinal hemorrhages, and decreased visual acuity and blindness may occur from venous congestion within the retina. Fever, tachycardia and sepsis may be present. Headache with nuchal rigidity may occur. Pupil may be dilated and sluggishly reactive. Infection can spread to contralateral cavernous sinus within 24–48 hours of initial presentation.|$|E
25|$|Cavernous sinus {{thrombosis}} (CST) is {{the formation}} of a blood clot within the cavernous sinus, a cavity {{at the base of the}} brain which drains deoxygenated blood from the brain back to the heart. The cause is usually from a spreading infection in the nose, sinuses, ears, or teeth. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus are often the associated bacteria. Cavernous sinus thrombosis symptoms include: decrease or loss of vision, <b>chemosis,</b> exophthalmos (bulging eyes), headaches, and paralysis of the cranial nerves which course through the cavernous sinus. This infection is life-threatening and requires immediate treatment, which usually includes antibiotics and sometimes surgical drainage.|$|E

50|$|The spitted venom is {{generally}} harmless on intact mammalian skin (although contact {{can result in}} delayed blistering of the area), but can cause permanent blindness if introduced to the eye; if left untreated it may cause <b>chemosis</b> and corneal swelling.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chemosis</b> is the {{swelling}} (or edema) of the conjunctiva. It {{is due to}} the oozing of exudate from abnormally permeable capillaries. In general, <b>chemosis</b> is a nonspecific sign of eye irritation. The outer surface covering appears to have fluid in it. The conjunctiva becomes swollen and gelatinous in appearance. Often, the eye area swells so much that the eyes become difficult or impossible to close fully. Sometimes, it may also appear as if the eyeball has moved slightly backwards from the white part of the eye due to the fluid filled in the conjunctiva all over the eyes except the iris.The iris is not covered by this fluid and so it appears to be moved slightly inwards.|$|E
5000|$|Conjunctival suffusion is an eye finding {{occurring}} {{early in}} Weil’s disease, {{which is caused}} by Leptospira interrogans. Conjunctival suffusion is characterized by redness of the conjunctiva that resembles conjunctivitis, {{but it does not}} involve inflammatory exudates. [...] Swelling of the conjunctiva (<b>chemosis)</b> is seen along the corners of the eye (palpebral fissures).|$|E
50|$|Common {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of orbital cellulitis include pain with eye movement, sudden vision loss, <b>chemosis,</b> bulging of the infected eye, and limited eye movement. Along with these symptoms, patients typically have redness and swelling of the eyelid, pain, discharge, inability to open the eye, occasional fever and lethargy. It is usually caused by a previous sinusitis. Other causes include infection of nearby structures, trauma and previous surgery.|$|E

5000|$|Common {{adverse effects}} include foreign body {{sensation}} in the eye, dry eye and epiphora (overflow of tears), <b>chemosis</b> (swelling of the conjunctiva), headache, and itching. Increased intraocular pressure (IOP), {{a side effect}} typical of corticosteroids, occurs in about 2% of patients (compared to 7% under prednisolone acetate, an older anti-inflammatory agent which is prescribed after eye surgery, and 0.5% under placebo). [...] Loteprednol is also {{far less likely to}} cause elevated IOP compared to dexamethasone.|$|E
5000|$|Affected {{individuals}} typically {{present with}} sudden painful proptosis, redness, and edema. Proptosis will {{vary according to}} the degree of inflammation, fibrosis, and mass effect. Occasionally, ptosis, <b>chemosis,</b> motility dysfunction (ophthalmoplegia), and optic neuropathy are seen. [...] In the setting of extensive sclerosis there may be restriction, compression, and destruction of orbital tissue. Symptoms usually develop acutely (hours to days), but have also been seen to develop over several weeks or even months.Malaise, headaches, and nausea may accompany these symptoms. Other unusual presentations described include cystoid macular edema, temporal arteritis, and cluster headaches.|$|E

50|$|On {{histological}} examination, {{there is}} an infiltration of the orbital connective tissue by lymphocytes, plasmocytes, and mastocytes. The inflammation results in a deposition of collagen and glycosaminoglycans in the muscles, which leads to subsequent enlargement and fibrosis. There is also an induction of the lipogenesis by fibroblasts and preadipocytes, which causes enlargement of the orbital fat and extra-ocular muscle compartments. This increase in volume of the intraorbital contents {{within the confines of}} the bony orbit may lead to dysthyroid optic neuropathy (DON), increased intraocular pressures, proptosis, and venous congestion leading to <b>chemosis</b> and periorbital oedema. In addition, the expansion of the intraorbital soft tissue volume may also remodel the bony orbit and enlarge it, which may be a form of auto-decompression.|$|E
50|$|In mild disease, {{patients}} {{present with}} eyelid retraction. In fact, upper eyelid retraction {{is the most}} common ocular sign of Graves' orbitopathy. This finding is associated with lid lag on infraduction (Von Graefe's sign), eye globe lag on supraduction (Kocher's sign), a widened palpebral fissure during fixation (Dalrymple's sign) and an incapacity of closing the eyelids completely (lagophthalmos). Due to the proptosis, eyelid retraction and lagophthalmos, the cornea is more prone to dryness and may present with <b>chemosis,</b> punctate epithelial erosions and superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis. The patients also have a dysfunction of the lacrimal gland with a decrease of the quantity and composition of tears produced. Non-specific symptoms with these pathologies include irritation, grittiness, photophobia, tearing, and blurred vision. Pain is not typical, but patients often complain of pressure in the orbit. Periorbital swelling due to inflammation can also be observed.|$|E
50|$|Systemic Histiocytosis (SH) was {{originally}} recognized in closely related Bernese Mountain Dogs. SH is a generalized histiocytic proliferative disease with a marked tendency to involve skin, ocular and nasal mucosa, and peripheral lymph nodes. The disease predominately affects young to middle aged male dogs (2-8 years), although cases in females have been observed. SH {{has been observed}} in other breeds less commonly (e.g. Irish Wolfhounds, Basset Hounds and others). Clinical signs vary with the severity and extent {{of the disease and}} include anorexia, marked weight loss, stertorous respiration and conjunctivitis with marked <b>chemosis.</b> Multiple cutaneous nodules may be distributed over the entire body, but are especially prevalent in the scrotum, nasal apex, nasal planum and eyelids. Peripheral lymph nodes are often palpably enlarged. The disease course may be punctuated by remissions and relapses, which may occur spontaneously especially early in the disease course. In severe disease, lesions become persistent and do not respond to immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{randomized}} prospective {{study was to determine}} the effects of head position on postoperative conjunctival swelling (<b>chemosis)</b> after prone spinal surgery. On the basis of the head position, 140 patients scheduled for prone lumbar surgery were randomly allocated into 2 groups: head neutral group (n = 70) versus Head Down (HD) group (n = 70). Head position was defined as neutral when the imaginary line from the occipital protuberance to the top of C 7 spine process is parallel to the operating table. HD position was maintained by adjusting the height of the prone headrest 5 cm lower than neutral position. <b>Chemosis</b> was evaluated after surgery. The overall incidence of <b>chemosis</b> in the Head Neutral group was significantly lower than the Head Down group [25 (35 %) vs 48 (68 %), p = 0. 003]. The severity of <b>chemosis,</b> which was graded as none, mild, moderate and severe, showed statistically significant difference between the head neutral group [45 (65 %), 14 (20 %), 7 (10 %), 4 (5 %), respectively] and Head Down group [22 (32 %), 13 (18 %), 25 (36 %), 10 (14 %), respectively, p< 0. 05]. This result suggested that neutral head position was useful in decreasing the development of postoperative <b>chemosis</b> after prone spinal surgery...|$|E
40|$|While ocular {{involvement}} {{is well documented}} in association with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF- 1), conjunctival neurofibromas are very rare. We describe a challenging NF- 1 case of a patient with a conjunctival neurofibroma in association with lower lid involutional entropion and severe conjunctival <b>chemosis.</b> A 65 year-old male presented with age-related left lower lid laxity, retractor dehiscence, inferior conjunctival <b>chemosis</b> and significant ocular discomfort. The patient underwent a left lower lid lateral tarsal strip procedure with retractor plication without much improvement in the <b>chemosis</b> and discomfort. However post-operatively it became evident that an injected mass was present in the left inferior fornix. Surgical debulking of this mass allowed for resolution of the patient’s signs and symptoms as well as proper lower lid alignment. Histopathologic diagnosis with S 100 and CD 34 positivity confirmed a conjunctival neurofibroma. Although uncommon, {{it is important to}} consider the possibility of a conjunctival mass in a patient with persistent <b>chemosis</b> and recurrent lower lid instability, particularly when confronted with a neurocutaneous syndrome. </p...|$|E
