50|$|The {{centrifugal}} supercharger draws {{its power}} from {{the movement of the}} drive where it is attached. At this point, the supercharger powers an impeller - or small rotating wheel. The impeller draws air into a small <b>compressor</b> <b>housing</b> (volute) and centrifugal force sends the air into the diffuser. The result is air that is highly pressurized, but that travels at low speed. The high-pressure, low-speed air is then fed into the engine, where the additional pressure gives the engine the ability to burn more fuel and have a higher level of combustion. This results in a faster, more responsive vehicle due to greater engine volumetric efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Key FeaturesREA is an electro {{mechanical}} device {{mounted on the}} <b>compressor</b> <b>housing</b> and connected to the VNT (for diesel applications) or the wastegate (for gasoline applications).

5000|$|The {{four main}} {{components}} of a centrifugal supercharger are the volute (<b>compressor</b> <b>housing),</b> diffuser, impeller and transmission. Volutes are typically cast into a form from aluminum rather than other metals due to the combination of strength, weight, and resistance to corrosion. Volutes are then precision machined to match the impeller design. [...] Impellers are designed in many configurations, and Euler’s pump and turbine equation {{plays an important role}} in understanding impeller performance. Impellers are often formed by casting metals into a form and then machined, with the highest quality impellers machined from solid billet. The transmission provides a step-up ratio from the input shaft (driven from the engine crankshaft) to the output shaft, to which the impeller attaches (it is not uncommon for centrifugal supercharger impeller speeds to exceed 100,000 rotations per minute). The basic components of the gear drive centrifugal transmission are shafts, gears, bearings, and seals. Because of the high speeds and loads the transmission must endure, components are machined, ground and assembled to extremely close tolerances.|$|E

The turbo with intercooler-equipped engine was the C20AT engine and are extremely rare. Honda pioneered variable-geometry turbo chargers. The [...] "Wing Turbo", as Honda called them, were controlled by an 8-bit processor ECU and they were constantly adjusting. Basically, at low speeds the wings surrounding the turbine wheel inside the <b>compressor</b> <b>housing</b> on the intake side would be nearly closed to speed and direct exhaust pressure precisely on the turbine wheel. At 2000 rpm, the wings would fluctuate and it would act like a much larger turbo to increase fuel economy as needed. This car was quick and powerful, but the price premium over the slightly longer and wider Legend with the 2.7 L naturally aspirated V6 {{was too much for}} most, so the car disappeared. This was one of the only production Hondas ever turbocharged from the factory (excluding turbo engines of kei car for the Japan domestic market), along with the K23A1 straight-4 engine used in the Acura RDX and the ER straight-4 engine used in the first generation Honda City.|$|E
5000|$|Accumulated heat is an {{important}} consideration {{in the operation of}} a compressor in an internal combustion engine. Of the three basic supercharger types, the Roots design historically possessed the worst thermal efficiency, especially at high pressure ratios. In accordance with the ideal gas law, a compression operation will raise the temperature of the compressed output. Additionally, the operation of the compressor itself requires energy input, which is converted to heat and can be transferred to the gas through the <b>compressor</b> <b>housing,</b> heating it more. Although intercoolers are more commonly known for their use on turbochargers, superchargers may also benefit from the use of an intercooler. Internal combustion is based upon a thermodynamic cycle, and a cooler temperature of the intake charge results in a greater thermodynamic expansion and vice versa. A hot intake charge provokes detonation in a petrol engine, and can melt the pistons in a diesel, while an intercooling stage adds complexity but can improve the power output by increasing the amount of the input charge, exactly as if the engine were of higher capacity. An intercooler reduces the thermodynamic efficiency by losing the heat (power) introduced by compression, but increases the power available because of the increased working mass for each cycle. Above about [...] the intercooling improvement can become dramatic. With a Roots-type supercharger, one method successfully employed is the addition of a thin heat exchanger placed between the blower and the engine. Water is circulated through it to a second unit placed near the front of the vehicle where a fan and the ambient air-stream can dissipate the collected heat.|$|E

50|$|US Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory {{developed}} the FDL-23, a 2nd generation Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA)In the early 1970s, two Ryan Model 147G reconnaissance drones were requisitioned from the Air Force Museum by the Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory at WPAFB to investigate high maneuverability flight and discover whether a high performance {{remotely piloted aircraft}} could perform {{some of the same}} missions as manned aircraft. The 147G was particularly suited for this since it had an extended nose section for equipment, a more powerful engine, and a larger wing than previous FireBee variants. The aircraft was fitted with a reinforced wing box, an active rudder, a nose video camera, a Vega digital control/data link, speed brakes, and a Lear Sieglar digital proportional autopilot. The modified drone was originally designated the FDL-23 and later the XQM-103. Six captive and six free flight test flights were performed, with the machine able to perform 10G turns in its final configuration. On its fifth mission, the engine shaft bent at 10 G's and impacted the <b>compressor</b> <b>housing,</b> damaging its engine. On its sixth mission, the aircraft refused to accept ground commands and self-recovered in the mountains north of Los Angeles with minor damage. The Program was completed successfully, and met all of its development objectives. Several major system including the autopilot and the command/control system were adopted by production drone programs. The major limitation to using the RPA for fighter missions was the lack of a video tracking system, which made tracking maneuvering targets extremely difficult.At the conclusion of the program, the aircraft was donated to the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah, and became a static display at the entrance to Eagle Range. This aircraft reappeared at Edwards AFB without the engine as a captive test platform for optics testing.|$|E

40|$|One {{dimensional}} wave-action engine {{models have}} become an essential tool within engine development including stages of component selection, understanding system interactions and control strategy development. Simple turbocharger models {{are seen as a}} weak link in the accuracy of these simulation tools and advanced models have been proposed to account for phenomena including heat transfer. In order to run within a full engine code, these models are necessarily simple in structure yet are required to describe a highly complex 3 D problem. This paper aims to assess the validity of one of the key assumptions in simple heat transfer models, namely, that the heat transfer between the compressor casing and intake air occurs only after the compression process. Initially a sensitivity study was conducted on a simple lumped capacity thermal model or a turbocharger. A new partition parameter was introduced alpha, which divides the internal wetted area of the <b>compressor</b> <b>housing</b> into pre and post compression. The sensitivity of heat fluxes to alpha was quantified with respect to the sensitivity to turbine inlet temperature (TIT). At low speeds, the TIT was the dominant effect on compressor efficiency whereas at high speed alpha had a similar influence to TIT. However, modelling of the conduction within the <b>compressor</b> <b>housing</b> using an additional thermal resistance caused changes in heat flows of less than 10 %. Three dimensional CFD analysis was undertaken using a number of cases approximating different values of alpha. It was seen that when considering a case similar to alpha= 0, significant temperature could build up in the impeller area of the <b>compressor</b> <b>housing,</b> indicating the importance of the pre-compression heat path. The 3 D simulation was used to estimate a realistic value for alpha which was suggested to be between 0. 15 and 0. 3. Using a value of this magnitude in the lumped capacitance model showed that at low speed there would be less than 1 % point effect on apparent efficiency which would be negligible compared to the 8 % point seen as a result of TIT. In contrast, at high speeds, the impact of alpha was similar to that of TIT, both leading to approximately 1 % point apparent efficiency error...|$|E
