West German acronyms ZDF and ARD accounted for Zentrales Deutsches Fernsehen Außer Rügen und Dresden (Central German TV except Rügen and Dresden). Whilst radio signals from international broadcasters like the BBC and the American-backed local station RIAS in West Berlin could be jammed, it was diplomatically and technically awkward to block West German television {{as it would have}} been impossible to do so (with any degree of effectiveness) without affecting reception in parts of West Germany as well which (apart from being outlawed by treaty) in turn <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>prompted</b> the West Germans to retaliate against Eastern broadcasts.|$|R

40|$|Library {{inventories}} {{are widely}} acknowledged for their importance in intellectual history, {{but there are}} few detailed studies of library classification in this context.

Nine of the inventories are transcribed from unpublished manuscripts, including lists of the books of William Paget, 4 th Baron Paget (1617), William Somner (1639), and a previously unidentified catalogue of the books of the physician William Rant (1595). The classification of books was a matter of some concern at the time: the problems raised by library classification were beginning {{to attract the attention of}} writers on the subject, and a compiler's approach was not always as haphazard as it may seem at first. On the whole, however, the classification of books was more spontaneous than deliberate, and it is for this reason that it was often finely attuned to the professional concerns and personal interests of owners, as well as to the cultural climate of the time (religious controversies, interest in languages other than Latin). The medieval trivium was losing its momentum in the classifications of the period, and mathematics, for centuries associated with the quadrivium in classifications, was viewed in a new light under the influence of Neo-Platonism. New trends in library classification appeared side by side with age-long practices, thereby underscoring the deeply transitional nature of the period...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} men’s {{discussions and}} experiences of health and illness and its relation to, and implications for, the practices of masculinity amongst a diversity of men. Fifty five men participated in fourteen semi-structured focus group interviews. Diversity in men’s experiences of health and illness and in their constructions of masculinity was sought within the sample by age (range 15 - 72 years), occupational status, socio-economic background and current health status. Groups of men were recruited who had had ‘everyday’ or unremarkable experiences of masculinity and health and groups of men with health experiences that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>prompted</b> reflection on masculinity and health. This included groups with men who had prostate cancer, coronary heart disease, mental health problems, and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME). All of the men that {{participated in the study}} lived in central Scotland (Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Lanarkshire and Perthshire) and just one group was conducted with men of Asian origin, which reflects the limited ethnic diversity in this part of Britain. The first data chapter examines participants’ descriptions of their masculinity and their health-related beliefs and behaviours. The data capture both the experiences of men who felt pressured to engage in behaviours that may be harmful to their health in order to appear masculine and the accounts of those who regarded themselves as freer to embrace salutogenic health practices as they perceived there to be fewer consequences for their masculinities. These considerations are then followed by an examination of how participants re-negotiated male identity in the light of illness. The final data chapter presents participants’ discussions {{and experiences of}} help seeking and its relation to the practice of masculinity. The data suggests a widespread endorsement of a ‘hegemonic’ view that men ‘should’ be reluctant to seek help, particularly amongst younger men.

40|$|For {{the first}} time, a {{sediment}} core spanning the entire Holocene has been analysed from Fiji. The 6 m core {{was obtained from}} the floor of an ancient coastal lagoon (palaeolagoon) adjacent to Bourewa, the site of the earliest known human settlement in this island group. The basal sediments, just above bedrock, date from 11 470 cal BP. A major transition occurs around 8000 cal BP where marine influences on palaeolagoon sedimentation increase sharply. Full shallow-water marine conditions are attained around 4630 cal BP and last until 3480 cal BP after which there is a regressive phase. The results agree with the area-specific predictions of sea level in the ICE- 4 G model, particularly in the timing of the highstand. In addition, the results support the ideas (a) that early human colonisation of Fiji occurred during the late Holocene regression, (b) that the first inhabitants of Bourewa utilised both nearshore marine (reefal) and brackish lagoon food sources, and (c) that the abrupt human abandonment of the area around 2500 cal BP <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been <b>prompted</b> by a reduction in these resources driven largely by sea-level fall. © 2011 Geographical Society of New South Wales Inc...|$|R

5000|$|The {{political}} {{reality of the}} disappearance of the princes, whatever happened to them, is that they were believed to have been murdered and Richard was blamed for their murders. Even if he had not been directly responsible for their deaths, {{the fact that he had}} deposed them and kept them under tight guard made him responsible for their welfare in the eyes of contemporaries, and the belief that they had been murdered made him guilty via negligence if not directly. As Baldwin noted in support of his conclusion that Richard would not have murdered the princes, 'It seems incredible Richard ever supposed killing his nephews would help secure his position or make him more acceptable to his subjects.' An initial uprising in September 1483, aimed at deposing Richard and restoring Edward V to the throne, was not stopped by rumours of Edward's murder. Instead, the rebels rallied around Henry Tudor as a potential alternative candidate, who was, as Horrox notes, 'an inconceivable choice if Edward V and his brother were thought to be still available.' [...] Anthony Cheetham, who considered Richard likely did have the princes murdered, commented that it was 'a colossal blunder. Nothing else <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>prompted</b> the deflated Woodvilles to hitch themselves to Henry Tudor's bandwagon.' The fact that the majority of the rebels were wealthy and powerful southern noblemen, loyal to Edward IV, suggests a degree of revulsion against Richard's usurpation of the throne: their willingness to fight on under an implausible alternative candidate suggests that they regarded anyone as preferable to Richard as King due to his usurpation and the murder of his nephews. Bennett suggested that perhaps those who had initially supported Richard in his seizure of power may have felt complicit in the crime, which he thought 'might explain the bitterness of the subsequent recriminations against him.' [...] Hicks speculated that these men may have been 'appalled by the character of the regime...shocked by Richard's crimes.' Their defection severely weakened Richard, who had to impose his supporters among the northern lords as officeholders in the southern counties to maintain order, in itself a very unpopular act that further damaged his reputation. In Pollard's words, 'the belief that he had murdered his nephews seriously handicapped Richard's efforts to secure himself on the throne he had usurped.' ...|$|R
6000|$|There was {{an appeal}} all round to Felix, {{but he was}} not so {{practicable}} as the universal compliments to his good sense showed to be expected. He had expressed his opinion that it was a rash engagement, hitherto improperly carried on; but he could not be brought to advise his brother to break it off on his side while the lady held to it on hers. It might be best to give it up by mutual consent; but as long as one party was bound, so was the other; and he thoroughly sided with Edgar in not being threatened out of it whilst Alice persisted. Still more flatly did he refuse Miss Pearson's entreaty that he would see the wilful girl, and persuade her how hopeless was her resistance, and how little prospect of the attachment being prosperous. Nothing but despair and perplexity <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>prompted</b> the good aunts to try such a resource, but they were at their wits' end. They really loved their niece, and they dreaded the tender mercies of her father, who had indeed petted Alice as a young child, but had made her mother suffer greatly from his temper. If she would yield, they hoped to procure for her a home at York, with their brother's widow, and to save her from a residence in Jersey with the step-mother; but Alice, upheld by a secret commerce of notes ingeniously conveyed, felt herself a heroine of constancy, and kept up her spirits by little irritations to whoever tried to deal with her. She could deftly insinuate, on the one hand, that her aunts had always preached up the Underwood perfections; and on the other, hint to her father that if her home had still remained what it was, she should never have looked out of it; and whenever he flew into a rage, or used violent language, she would look up under her eyelids and whisper something about 'real gentlemen.' Those thorns and claws that had figured in the scale of her transmigration were giving a good many little scratches, which did her feelings some good, but her cause none at all, by the vexation they produced.

40|$|Historically, {{accountants}} and accounting {{have played a}} very important role in Muslim societies. Accountants, who were known as Al-Kateb (accountants/bookkeepers/accounts clerks), held very prestigious positions in government, business and society. They were the advisors and decision-makers for the rulers, business peoples and society at large. The primary objective of accounting was the ascertainment of the adequacy of the transactions from the religious view point and the appropriate calculation of Zakat (religious levy). The role and responsibilities of Al-Kateb were much broader than those that exist in many instances today. The expanded role and status of Al-Kateb resulted in the establishment of comprehensive and demanding appointment criteria. Some of these criteria were of a compulsory nature while others were optional and were known as recommended appointment requirements. This paper examines the mandatory appointment requirements that were, at large, based on Shari'ah Islami'iah (Islamic teachings) that reflects the role of Islam as a comprehensive code of life for Muslims. Technical competence was also a mandatory requirement that had to serve the religious requirements in the process of recording and interpreting business transactions. Some of the mandatory appointment requirements of Al-Kateb are, in essence, similar to current Western practices. The similarity <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been <b>prompted</b> by historical business relationships between Muslim and Europeans (especially Italians) since the twelfth century.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{evolutionary}} dynamics of ribosomal RNA genes (rDNAs) in the Byblis liniflora complex (Byblidaceae), we investigated the 5 S and 45 S rDNA genes through (1) chromosomal physical mapping by fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} (FISH) and (2) phylogenetic analyses using the nontranscribed spacer of 5 S rDNA (5 S-NTS) and the internal transcribed spacer of 45 S rDNA (ITS). In addition, we performed phylogenetic analyses based on rbcL and trnK intron. The complex was divided into 2 clades: B. aquatica–B. filifolia and B. guehoi–B. liniflora–B. rorida. Although members of the complex had conservative symmetric karyotypes, they were clearly differentiated on chromosomal rDNA distribution patterns. The sequence data indicated that ITS was almost homogeneous in all taxa in which two or four 45 S rDNA arrays were frequently found at distal regions of chromosomes in the somatic karyotype. ITS homogenization <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been <b>prompted</b> by relatively distal 45 S rDNA positions. In contrast, 2 – 12 5 S rDNA arrays were mapped onto proximal/interstitial regions of chromosomes, and some paralogous 5 S-NTS were found in the genomes harboring 4 or more arrays. 5 S-NTS sequence type-specific FISH analysis showed sequence heterogeneity within and between some 5 S rDNA arrays. Interlocus homogenization may have been hampered by their proximal location on chromosomes.
