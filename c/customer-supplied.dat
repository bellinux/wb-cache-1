25|$|Most {{domestic}} {{electricity meters}} must be read manually, whether by {{a representative of}} the power company or by the customer. Where the customer reads the meter, the reading may be supplied to the power company by telephone, post or over the internet. The electricity company will normally require a visit by a company representative at least annually in order to verify <b>customer-supplied</b> readings and to make a basic safety check of the meter.|$|E

5000|$|Starting in the 1950s, several US {{railroad}} {{freight carriers}} began rostering boxcars equipped with load-securing devices to prevent shifting during transit. These cars were usually labeled [...] "Damage Free" [...] or simply [...] "DF". The interior equipment helped {{to eliminate the}} need for <b>customer-supplied</b> dunnage.|$|E
5000|$|Using the mid-engine chassis of the Crown Supercoach {{school bus}} as a basis, the Firecoach was {{produced}} in several configurations for fire departments.

50|$|Included {{with the}} gun was a {{patented}} double magazine pouch which used a magnet to hold the spare magazines in place. The cost for the complete ASP modification package on a <b>customer-supplied</b> handgun was $475, and was done by a subsidiary company, Armament Systems and Procedures, Inc..|$|E
50|$|The firm's first product, {{introduced}} in 2007, is a USB device that has both the software necessary to place Internet-based telephone calls via a <b>customer-supplied</b> high-speed Internet connection and the electronics (technically {{known as a}} SLIC, or Subscriber Line Interface Circuit) which allow conventional landline telephones to be plugged directly into the device.|$|E
50|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, {{there was a}} {{shortage}} of DRAM caused by the Reagan Administration enacting anti-dumping restrictions on Japanese manufacturers, thus 1750s were rare and expensive. However it was comparatively easy to upgrade a 1700 or 1764 to 512 kB. Several firms did this commercially, either selling upgraded units or upgrading <b>customer-supplied</b> units.|$|E

50|$|A Registered Jack (RJ) is a {{standardized}} telecommunication network interface for connecting voice and data equipment to a service {{provided by a}} local exchange carrier or long distance carrier. Registration interfaces were first defined in the Universal Service Ordering Code (USOC) system of the Bell System in the United States for complying with the registration program for <b>customer-supplied</b> telephone equipment mandated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the 1970s. They were subsequently codified in title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68.|$|E
5000|$|Oakland Airmotive {{intended}} to produce converted planes starting in 1960, but never progressed beyond manufacturing and installing Super-V conversion kits on <b>customer-supplied</b> Bonanzas. Ed Gough was the President. FAA type certification was granted in June 1960. Production drawings, bills of material, etc. were prepared {{and there were}} several conversions in the pipeline. Flying Magazine published {{a story on the}} Super V in October 1960 and the marketing efforts were reaching a peak, with a Super-V (Registration N617B) completing a successful circumnavigation of the globe. [...] The cost of a standard conversion was priced in 1960 at , not including the cost of the donor aircraft.|$|E
40|$|An ultra-lightweight Propellant Manage-ment Device (PMD) was {{required}} for an interplanetary mission, and a new PMD development program was conducted to design, fabricate, and test this PMD. The PMD is designed for installation into a <b>customer-supplied</b> tank shell. There are several unusual features about this PMD: (1) it contains both pressurant inlet and propellant outlet ports, (2) the PMD is installed into a threaded outlet boss, (3) {{the weight of the}} PMD must be no more than 0. 1 kg (0. 22 lbm), and (4) the PMD is designed for horizontal ground operations and launch. PMD performance analysis was conducted to design this PMD, and PMD structural analysis was performed to validate the PMD design. This PMD was made from all-titanium components, including porous screens. Only existing processes and procedures were used during the fabrication process. The PMD was bubble point tested prior to delivery. All PMDs have been delivered to the customer...|$|E
40|$|This section {{provides}} the expected ground and flight environments that a SC may encounter during a Proton launch campaign and flight. 3. 1 THERMAL/HUMIDITY In this section, the thermal and humidity {{environment for the}} SC is defined for transportation from the Yubileiny Airfield through launch base processing, launch and separation. SC component temperatures, {{to be used for}} assessing ground and flight thermal compatibility, will be determined by analysis using a <b>Customer-supplied</b> SC thermal model. 3. 1. 1 SC Ground Thermal and Humidity Environment Ambient temperatures at the Baikonur Cosmodrome are provided in Table 3. 1. 1 - 1. Facility and transportation temperatures and relative humidity are provided in Table 3. 1. 1 - 2. During transport, the SC is air-conditioned either by Customer-provided air conditioning equipment or by a railcar-mounted thermal control unit. While on the pad, thermal control is provided by the Air Thermal Mode Control System (ATMCS) and/or the Liquid Thermal Mode Control System (LTMCS) ...|$|E
40|$|The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has funded a {{pilot project}} to assist small and medium-size {{manufacturers}} who want to minimize their generation of waste but who lack the expertise to do so. In an effort to assist these manufacturers Waste Minimization Assessment Centers (WMACs) were established at selected universities and procedures were adapted from the EPA Waste Minimization Opportunity Assessment Manual. The WMAC team at Colorado State University performed an assessment at a plant that manufacturers printed circuit boards. Templates for the circuit design are generated from <b>customer-supplied</b> circuit information. Copper/epoxy laminates and copper foil are cut into blank boards and layers. Circuit patterns are generated {{through a series of}} photolithographic and plating processes. The team`s report, detailing findings and recommendations, indicated that the onsite ion-exchange treatment of metal-containing rinse water generates regenerant solutions that could be further treated by electrowinning to recover metals and to achieve significant cost savings. This Research Brief was developed by the principal investigators and EPA`s National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Cincinnati, OH, to announce key findings of an ongoing research project that is fully documented in a separate report of the same title available from University City Science Center...|$|E
40|$|The {{effective}} implementation {{of such an}} ISO 9001 Quality Management System (QMS) in construction companies requires a proper and full implementation of the system to allow companies to improve the way they operate, by this means increasing profitability and market share, producing innovative and sustainable construction products, or improving employee and customer satisfaction. In light of this, this paper discusses {{the current status of}} QMS implementation, particularly related to the twenty elements of ISO 9001 within the grade 7 (G- 7) category of Indonesian construction companies. A survey was conducted involving 403 respondents from 77 companies, to solicit an evaluation of the current implementation levels of the ISO 9001 elements. The survey findings indicated that for {{a large percentage of the}} sector surveyed they had ‘not so fully implemented’ the elements. Scrutiny of the data had also indicated elements that are ‘minimally implemented’, whilst none of the elements fell in the category of ‘fully implemented’. Based on these findings, it is suggested that the G- 7 contractors may need to fully commit to practicing control of <b>customer-supplied</b> product and statistical techniques in order to enhance an {{effective implementation}} of ISO 9001 elements for ensuring better quality performance. These two elements are recognized as the least implemented of the quality elements...|$|E
