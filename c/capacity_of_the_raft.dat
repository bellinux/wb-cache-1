40|$|Piled raft {{foundation}} is an economical foundation system where the bearing <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>raft</b> is {{taken into consideration}} in supporting the loads from superstructure. The piles in a piled raft system are used to enhance the bearing <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>raft</b> and also to control settlement, especially differential settlement and hence, these piles {{are commonly known as}} ‘’settlement reducing piles’'. Therefore, piled raft is a technically competent foundation system and offers significant savings in terms of overall foundation cost as compared to conventional piled foundation. This is because conventional piled foundation usually ignores the contribution of the raft and assumes the loads are supported entirely by the piles. However, the use of piled {{raft foundation}} system requires careful design and analysis as it involves complex interactions. In this paper nonlinear 3 D finite difference analysis was carried out to model the piled raft problems using the commercial software FLAC 3 D. In order to check the validity of the proposed numerical modelling a back-analysis was made for a case study. A comprehensive parametric study was performed on a hypothetical square piled raft over three clay soil profiles with different degrees of stiffness. The variation was made in number of piles, length of piles and distribution of piles over the raft area. The effect of these variables upon the average settlement and differential settlement was studied...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Standards {{and design}} rules for Combined Piled-Raft Foundations (short CPRF) are not {{available}} up to now. But the problem of design of Combined Piled-Raft Foundations {{becomes more and more}} important in the last years, when some skyscrapers were built in Germany. Most of them are located in Frankfurt on Main. The CPRF is a good economic decision for high rise buildings because both the bearing <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>raft</b> and the bearing capacity of the piles are completely used. The CPRF acts as a composite construction consisting of the three bearing elements: piles, raft and subsoil. In comparison with the conventional foundations design the CPRF leads to a totally new dimension of the subsoil-structure interaction because of the new design philosophy using the piles up to their ultimate bearing capacity concerning the soil-pile interaction. This leads to an extremely economical Foundations with rather low settlements, if the stiffness of the soil is increasing with depth (Katz...|$|E
40|$|For the {{structures}} supported on soft soils, piled raft foundations {{have been shown}} to be more economical than conventional piled foundations. In piled raft foundations, the bearing capacity of the underlying soil is taken into account to support the superstructure loads and the piles are placed such that they increase the bearing <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>raft</b> and control both the total and differential settlements of the superstructure. In the city of Kerman, Iran, the predominance of soft soils had historically hampered the construction of high-rise buildings across the city. Recently, an eighteen-story reinforced concrete building was constructed on a micropiled-raft foundation which was placed on a 30 m-thick layer of soft saturated calcareous silty soil. Conventional laboratory and plate loading test results on the foundation soil indicated that a raft foundation would have adequate bearing capacity, but would experience excessive settlements. As a remedial solution, a micropiled-raft foundation system was considered as a design option for the foundation of the structure. A prototype micropile was designed and installed based on the FHWA (2000) guidelines and tested at the site. The test results were used to design the micropiled raft foundation using a finite element program. The results of the analysis showed that micropiled-raft foundations can provide a cost-effective engineering solution for high-rise buildings constructed on soft soils. The results of this study were successfully employed to construct additional high-rise buildings in the city...|$|E
50|$|Size {{and cargo}} capacity. An {{engineering}} {{study concluded that}} ocean going rafts ranged in size from 6 m to 11 m long and had a cargo <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> 10 to 30 tons. <b>The</b> cargo <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rafts</b> declined as <b>the</b> balsa logs absorbed sea water. After 4 months in <b>the</b> water <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest <b>rafts</b> declined to 10 tons and after 8 months to 5 tons. Thus, {{a little more than}} 8 months in the water was <b>the</b> useful life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rafts.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> piled <b>raft</b> {{foundation}} {{is based on}} a skillful geotechnical concept wherein the pile group does not have any accountability for the safety and stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure but performs <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> settlement reducer. In <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> piled <b>raft,</b> <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overall foundation system gains more importance than <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> individual constituting elements. Hence it becomes necessary to establish <b>the</b> limiting <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> piled <b>raft</b> so that <b>the</b> factor <b>of</b> safety for <b>the</b> overall system stability requirements can be assessed.

40|$|In this study, {{the total}} bearing <b>capacity</b> {{estimation}} <b>of</b> Eco-Friendly Raft Pile Foundation System (ERP System) {{that act as}} a floating raft-pile system subjected to axial loading is presented. The proposed analysis {{is based on the}} conventional formulas and the secondary data from <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> foundation prototypes tested on site through Plate Bearing Test. In this study, analytical formulas to estimate the axial pile capacity and the group piles efficiency for piles in clay is reviewed. The calculation using the formulas is compared to the secondary data based on Plate Bearing Test results. Based on the calculation by validating the standard formula, it shows that the allowable bearing capacity is similar with allowable bearing capacity from the secondary data that obtained based on the field test. <b>The</b> axial <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eco-Friendly <b>Raft</b> Pile Foundation System (ERP System) floating in clays can be concluded higher than the original ground without ERP System.

40|$|AbstractThe {{static and}} seismic {{behavior}} of a piled raft foundation, supporting a 12 -story base-isolated building in Tokyo, is investigated by monitoring the soil–foundation–structure system. Since the building is located on loose silty sand, underlain by soft cohesive soil, a piled raft with grid-form deep cement mixing walls was employed {{to cope with the}} liquefiable sand as well as to improve the bearing <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>raft</b> foundation. To confirm the validity of the foundation design, field measurements were carried out on the ground settlements, the pile loads, the contact pressure and the pore-water pressure beneath the raft {{from the beginning of the}} construction to 43 months after the end of the construction. On March 11, 2011, 30 months after the end of the construction, the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake struck the building site. The seismic response of the ground and the foundation–structure system was successfully recorded during the earthquake, and a peak horizontal ground acceleration of 1. 75 m/s 2 was observed at the site of the building. Based on static and dynamic measurement results, it was found that there was little change in the foundation settlement and the load sharing between the raft and the piles before and after the earthquake. It was also found that the horizontal accelerations of the superstructure were reduced to approximately 30 % of those of the ground near the ground surface by the input losses due to the kinematic soil–foundation interaction in addition to the base isolation system. Consequently, the piled raft with grid-form deep cement mixing walls was found to be quite stable in the soft ground during and after the earthquake...|$|E
50|$|Taco - If a raft is soft, or under-inflated, it may taco, {{or reverse}} taco.

There was a great company of men at each end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>raft.</b> Rollo could see those at the lowest end the plainest. They were standing in rows near <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>raft,</b> and every six of them had an oar. There were eight or ten of these oars, all projecting forward, from <b>the</b> front end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>raft,</b> and <b>the</b> raftsmen, by working them, seemed to be endeavoring to row that end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>raft</b> out farther into the stream. It was the same at <b>the</b> farther end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>raft.</b> There was a similar number of oarsmen there, and of oars, only those projected behind, just as the others did before. There were no oars at all along <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>raft.</b>|$|R
40|$|A common {{engineering}} {{solution for}} excessive settlement with raft foundation (s) is <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> piles {{in order to}} reduce the vertical displacements, in this method, the whole structural load is transferred to the piles. This is an overly cautious approach, and there remains a need to find an optimal design method for a building’s foundations.
