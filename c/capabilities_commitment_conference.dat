40|$|The {{conclusion}} of the Portuguese Presidency at Feira represents the latest stage in a process set into motion eighteen months earlier. The implications of the Feira conclusions for the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) fall more into the maximalist camp (meaning {{that there is a}} need for significant treaty revision) given the ambitious deadline of the ‘Headline Goals’. It is argued that the Amsterdam treaty revisions did not provide for sufficient flexibility in the security and defence areas and it is therefore imperative that treaty revision be addressed, even in the recesses of the ‘parallel’ IGC meeting on CFSP.

The analysis considers {{the achievements of the}} WMDI as well as the obstacles and challenges the Alliance faces in countering WMD threats. For over a decade, the Alliance has been concerned about the threats posed by biological, chemical, nuclear, and radiological weapons. In 1994, NATO established the Senior Political-Military Group on Proliferation and the Senior Defense Group on Proliferation to implement alliance policy on WMD proliferation. Through the WMDI, NATO enhanced its efforts to address these threats through the establishment of a WMD Center at NATO Headquarters in Brussels to facilitate dialogue and coordination relating to threat assessment, and to develop responses to such threats. At the Prague Summit in November 2002 the Allies made firmer <b>commitments</b> to develop <b>capabilities</b> to respond to WMD threats.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis analyzes {{the origins and}} prospects of NATO's Prague <b>Capabilities</b> <b>Commitment</b> (PCC). Following {{the end of the}} Cold War in 1989 - 1991, NATO's conventional military capabilities rose in importance as the Allies undertook crisis management operations in the Balkans. Capability shortcomings, particularly among the European Allies, led NATO in 1999 to approve a Defense Capabilities Initiative (DCI). However, the DCI's disappointing results, the terrorist attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001, the subsequent American military action in Afghanistan in cooperation with NATO Allies, the leading role of NATO Allies in the International Security Assistance Force in Kabul, and other factors convinced the Allies to make a new effort to improve capabilities. The Allies decided at the November 2002 Prague Summit to endorse the PCC. The PCC's prospects for success may not be greater than those of the DCI unless the European Allies commit greater resources, pool assets in multinational frameworks, pursue specialization in military missions, and modify their procurement priorities. Moreover, the PCC's success hinges on closely related initiatives: the NATO Response Force and the new command structures. Major, United States Marine Corp...|$|R

40|$|A direct {{commitment}}/bench commitment {{occurs when}} the court orders a youth into commitment placement usually {{as part of a}} plea arrangement between the state attorney and the defense attorney. In this instance, the Pre-Disposition Report (PDR) requirement is waived. The PDR is the mechanism by which the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice (FDJJ) provides a recommendation to the court. Without the PDR, the FDJJ is not provided an opportunity for the commitment staffing process that includes a comprehensive evaluation to help identify the appropriate recommendation to the court. The court usually does direct commitments/bench commitments on felony offenses, though some jurisdictions may do a direct commitment on misdemeanors, especially when they believe the FDJJ will not recommend residential commitment. This process allows the court to bypass the requirement of a written explanation as to the reasons for a deviation from FDJJ’s recommendation.

40|$|This study {{explored}} organizational service {{orientation and}} focused on the dimensions, limits and measurability of the construct. A concept-centric literature review was conducted to clarify the borders of the construct, to investigate the dimensions of the construct and to gather tools for comprehensive measurement of the construct. Based on the findings, this study constructed an analytical framework for organizational service orientation and formed a scale that measures it accordingly. The framework and the scale represent a comprehensive view on the subject avoiding the context restrictions evident in previous research. The theoretical findings implicate that the following dimensions are essential for organizational service orientation: internal characteristics (e. g., service climate and organizational culture), strategy (e. g., service-orientated business strategy and service-oriented strategic choices) {{and the nature of the}} services offered (e. g., services in support of the client's actions or in support of the product). In the empirical section, the framework and the scale were utilized to gather data from the retail sector to examine organizational service orientation. First, the scales were pre-tested during February-March 2013 with a test survey among the members of the Union of special trade (Erikoiskaupanliitto) yielding 39 responses. Second, the actual quantitative data used in this study was collected during October-November 2013 with a web-based questionnaire administered to 1263 operative managers of speciality retail stores in Finland. The survey yielded 152 acceptable responses (response rate 12. 02 %). An exploratory factor analysis was conducted on the collected data in order to identify the underlying dimensions of organizational service orientation. The empirical findings of the analysis indicate five acceptable factors in the collected data: service-minded leadership, service <b>capabilities,</b> <b>commitment</b> to serving customers, service recovery and organizational service culture. The results of the analysis differ from the dimensions gathered from previous research, thus providing a ground for further investigations concerning the construct of organizational service orientation...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to examine the marketing strategies of Ethiopian medium and large textile companies. The textile sector became the focus of this study because it has performed far below expectation, despite the government‘s unreserved support to the sector and the country‘s comparative advantage in the sector. To attain the stated objective, qualitative research approach with case study design was employed. The cases were selected based on two criteria; production of finished textile products and operation in both local and global markets. Accordingly, nine companies qualified these criteria and all of them were used as cases. The RBV was the theory employed to explain the differences in performances among firms‘ in similar environment. Furthermore, within and cross case analyses were employed to get in-depth understanding and to explain about the marketing strategies of the firms. The major findings of the study indicate that the emphasis given to marketing strategy and the marketing resources and <b>capabilities</b> <b>commitment</b> thereof were found to be so low that the companies seemed to equate marketing strategy with selling strategy. Furthermore, the companies failed to link their marketing enabling environment with their marketing strategy. Similarly, such weak link was reflected between the firms‘ marketing strategy and their market performances. Hence, the marketing strategies of the case companies are so weak that with their current marketing strategy, it is difficult for them to be competent in the local market, let alone in the international markets. Generally, both empirical and conceptual conclusions were drawn from the findings. As a result, the cross-case findings indicate that marketing resources commitment is linearly linked to marketing strategy which in turn is linked to export performances. Therefore, it can be understood that the link between enabling environment and marketing strategy is direct and the link between marketing strategy and marketing performances is linear. Hence, it can be understood from this transitivity that there exists a link between firms‘ enabling environment and their marketing performances. Business ManagementD. B. L...|$|R
