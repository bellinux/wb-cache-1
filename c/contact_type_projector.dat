Additionally, the bias resistor was connected in series to the actuation electrode to suppress the insertion loss when the switch was ON.

Therefore, RF-MEMS switches are expected to replace conventional semiconductor switches, especially in 5 G transceiver modules [4]. Moreover, they are considered key devices in future satellite communication systems [5, 6]. However, RF-MEMS switches also have disadvantages that stem from their successive mechanical movement during ON–OFF switching.
