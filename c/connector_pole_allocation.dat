40|$|ABSTRACT We have {{isolated}} a nucleus-basal body complex from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The {{complex is}} strongly immunoreactive to an antibody generated against a major protein constituent of isolated Tetraselmis striata flagellar roots (Salisbury, J. L., A. Baron, B. Surek, and M. Melkonian, J. Cell Biol., 99 : 962 - 970). Electrophoretic and immunoelectrophoretic analysis indicates that, like the Tetraselmis protein, the Chlamydomonas antigen {{consists of two}} acidic isoforms of ~ 20 kD. Indirect immunofluorescent staining of nucleus-basal body complexes reveals two major fibers in the connector region, one between each basal body and the nucleus. The nucleus is also strongly immunoreactive, with staining radiating around much of the nucleus from a region of greatest concentration at the <b>connector</b> <b>pole.</b> Calcium treatment causes shortening of the connector fibers and also movement of nuclear DNA towards the <b>connector</b> <b>pole.</b> Electron microscopic observation of negatively stained nucleus-basal body complexes reveals a cluster of ~ 6 -nm filaments, suspected to represent the connector, between the basal bodies and nuclei. A mutant with a variable number of flagella, vfl- 2 - 220, is defective {{with respect to the}} nucleus-basal body association. This observation encourages us to speculate that the nucleusbasa...|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} of modeling and controlling flexible manipulator arms was examined. A modal approach {{was used for}} obtaining the mathematical model and control techniques. The arm model was represented mathematically by a state space description {{defined in terms of}} joint angles and mode amplitudes obtained from truncation on the distributed systems, and included the motion of a two link two joint arm. Three basic techniques were used for controlling the system: <b>pole</b> <b>allocation</b> with gains obtained from the rigid system with interjoint feedbacks, Simon-Mitter algorithm for <b>pole</b> <b>allocation,</b> and sensitivity analysis with respect to parameter variations. An improvement in arm bandwidth was obtained. Optimization of some geometric parameters was undertaken to maximize bandwidth for various payload sizes and programmed tasks. The controlled system is examined under constant gains and using the nonlinear model for simulations following a time varying state trajectory...|$|R

40|$|We have {{isolated}} a nucleus-basal body complex from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.

Electrophoretic and immunoelectrophoretic analysis indicates that, like the Tetraselmis protein, the Chlamydomonas antigen {{consists of two}} acidic isoforms of approximately 20 kD. Indirect immunofluorescent staining of nucleus- basal body complexes reveals two major fibers in the connector region, one between each basal body and the nucleus. The nucleus is also strongly immunoreactive, with staining radiating around much of the nucleus from a region of greatest concentration at the <b>connector</b> <b>pole.</b> Calcium treatment causes shortening of the connector fibers and also movement of nuclear DNA towards the <b>connector</b> <b>pole.</b> Electron microscopic observation of negatively stained nucleus-basal body complexes reveals a cluster of approximately 6 -nm filaments, suspected to represent the connector, between the basal bodies and nuclei.

This observation encourages us to speculate that the nucleus-basal body union is important for accurate basal body localization within the cell and/or for accurate segregation of parental and daughter basal bodies at cell division. A physical association between nuclei and basal bodies or centrioles has been observed in a variety of algal, protozoan, and metazoan cells, although the nature of the association, in terms of both structure and function, has been obscure. We believe it likely that fibrous connectors homologous to those described here for Chlamydomonas are general features of centriole-bearing eucaryotic cells...|$|R

40|$|Several {{approaches}} for an {{attitude control system}} are studied and developed for a large space construction base that is structurally flexible. Digital simulations were obtained using the following techniques: (1) the multivariable Nyquist array method combined with closed loop <b>pole</b> <b>allocation,</b> (2) the linear quadratic regulator method. Equations for the three-axis simulation using the multilevel control method were generated and are presented. Several alternate control approaches are also described. A technique is demonstrated for obtaining the dynamic structural properties of a vehicle which is constructed {{of two or more}} submodules of known dynamic characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show how the {{important}} problems of linear system theory can be solved concisely for a particular class of linear systems, namely block circulant systems, by exploiting the algebraic structure. This type of system arises in lumped approximations to linear partial differential equations. The computation of the transition matrix, the variation of constants formula, observability, controllability, <b>pole</b> <b>allocation,</b> realization theory, stability and quadratic optimal control are discussed. In principle, all questions which are solved here could also be solved by standard methods; the present paper clearly exposes the structure of the solution, and thus permits various savings in computational effort...|$|R
5000|$|Ackermann's {{formula is}} a control system design method for solving the <b>pole</b> <b>allocation</b> problem. One {{of the primary}} {{problems}} in control system design is to create controllers that will alter the dynamics of a system and take the poles to a more suitable, sometimes more stable, state. Such a problem can be tackled by many different methods; one such solution is {{the addition of a}} feedback loop {{in such a way that}} a gain is added to the input with which one can change the poles of the original system. If the system is controllable, an efficient method for pole placement is the Ackermann's formula, which will allow us to choose arbitrary poles to our system.|$|R
40|$|Supercavitating {{vehicles}} {{can achieve}} very high speed but the hydrodynamic {{forces and the}} forces balance of which are different from common underwater vehicles, because the most surfaces of the vehicle are in cavity. Compared to a fully-wetted vehicle for which substantial lift is generated due to vortex shedding off the hull, a supercavitating vehicle is enveloped by gas cavity and thus the lift is provided by control surface deflections of the cavitator and fins, as well as planing force between the vehicle and the cavity. In this paper, a proper dynamic model of the vehicle for pitch was presented by analyzing and studying hydrodynamic forces on the vehicle. Then robust <b>pole</b> <b>allocation</b> methodology was used to design the controller, and it got good dynamic stability. It provided a necessary theoretical dependence for farther studying the dynamic control problem of supercavitating vehicles. </p...|$|R
40|$|Structural control {{algorithms}} {{based on}} non-resonance theory are investigated. Specifically, {{a new approach}} for the selection of poles of the controlled system, based on complex Fourier coefficients of the incoming earthquake signal, suitable for <b>pole</b> <b>allocation</b> control algorithm, is proposed. The graphical representation of the complex Fourier coefficients of the incoming earthquake signal in the complex plane is used in order to choose the poles of the controlled system in such way that, first, resonance is avoided, and secondly, satisfactory levels of damping are obtained for each eigenmode, thus reducing the response. The potential applications {{and the effectiveness of}} the improved control algorithms are demonstrated by numerical examples. The simulation results indicate that a trade-off between the location of poles of the controlled structure and the structural response can be achieved.

Historically, balloon framing was used until the 1950s when fire safety concerns made platform framing inherently better.

40|$|Autonomous {{underwater}} {{vehicles are}} often used for performing scientific, emergency or other types of missions under harsh conditions and environments, which can have non-stable, variable parameters. So, the problem of developing autonomous underwater vehicle motion control systems, capable of operating properly in random environments, is highly relevant. The paper {{is dedicated to the}} synthesis of a PID-controller of a trim robust control system, capable of keeping an underwater vehicle stable during a translation at different angles of attack. In order to synthesize the PID-controller, two problems were solved: a new method of synthesizing a robust controller was developed and a mathematical model of an underwater vehicle motion process was derived. The newly developed mathematical model structure is simpler than others due to acceptance of some of the system parameters as interval ones. The synthesis method is based on a system <b>poles</b> <b>allocation</b> approach and allows providing the necessary transient process quality in a considered system...|$|R
40|$|Recently active {{structure}} controllers {{were considered}} {{to deal with the}} impact of earthquake forces and the result of the investigations provided multiple algorithms to calculate force control and many different ways to apply these forces on the structure. In this study, the efficiency and effectiveness of three methods (linear quadratic regulator, fuzzy logic and pole assigning) are investigated. In addition, three buildings with different height classes with an active tuned mass damper (ATMD) on the top floor are considered to compare the active control methods. Examples with known mass and stiffness and with variable mass are considered. The results show that all three control methods used for the ATMD device reduce the structural response. The fuzzy control method, caused a sharp decline in relative displacement of building floors up to 80 %. But in LQR and <b>pole</b> <b>allocation</b> procedures the applied force is limited. The best performance of fuzzy control is for high-rise buildings. The three different methods of control are stable in different masses and even under a random change of floor masses, their effectiveness can be trusted...|$|R

40|$|The {{recent years}} have seen the {{appearance}} of innovative systems for acoustic and vibration attenuation, most of them integrating new actuator technologies. In this sense, the study of algorithms for active vibrations control in rotating machinery became an area of enormous interest, mainly due to the countless demands of an optimal performance of mechanical systems in aircraft, aerospace and automotive structures. Also, many critical machines such as compressors, pumps and gas turbines continue to be used beyond their expected service life despite the associated potential for failure due to damage accumulation. In this way, this paper presents an developed approach for active vibration control in a rotor using Active Magnetic Bearings (AMB) that is numerically verified. The feedback technique is used for this controlling device and the controller gain is obtained by the <b>pole</b> <b>allocation.</b> The AMB uses electromagnetic forces to support a rotor without mechanical contact. It offers many advantages compared to fluid film and rolling element bearings, such as no wear, the ability to operate in high temperature environments, and no contamination of the working fluid due {{to the absence of}} lubricant in the system. By monitoring the position of the shaft and changing the dynamics of the system accordingly, the AMB keeps the rotor in a desired position. This unique feature has broadened the applications of AMB and no...|$|R
40|$|For many years, NEC (National Electric Coil) has {{provided}} hydrogenerator refurbishment services to several U. S. Government agencies and large investor owned utilities. These projects have involved complete rehabilitation and refurbishment of large hydrogenerators. The work-scopes typically involved {{replacement of the}} stator cores, new stator windings, and refurbished and reinsulated rotor field windings. One might assume that refurbishment of field poles would be a simple task, when compared to much more complex stator core and stator winding replacement work scopes. On the contrary, NEC has identified several complex issues in the field pole rehabilitation on older hydrogenerators. Such problems as bowing of the rotor field poles, looseness of the field poles on the rotor, fatigue of field <b>pole</b> <b>connectors,</b> and cracking of field pole damper bars, are examples of problems identified as part of these large refurbishment projects. In this paper, several of the problems encountered will be fully described, along {{with the consequences of}} the problem in terms of operational difficulties. Solutions developed during the project will be presented as well as complete recommendations to prevent reoccurrence. This paper will be useful for owners of older hydrogenerator plants, who may be entering into a large refurbishment project. Prior knowledge of these types of problems may save time and money in the refurbishment project and improve reliability over the operational life of the unit...|$|R
40|$|Aging {{analyses}} were performed on solder joints from two radar units: (1) a laboratory, N 57 tube-type radar unit and (2) a field-returned, B 61 - 0, tube-type radar unit. The cumulative temperature environments experienced by the units during aging were calculated from the intermetallic compound layer thickness and the mean Pb-rich phase particle size metrics for solder joints in the units, assuming an aging time of 35 years for both radars. Baseline aging metrics were obtained from a laboratory test vehicle assembled at AS/FM and T; the aging kinetics of both metrics were calculated from isothermal aging experiments. The N 57 radar unit interconnect board solder joints exhibited very little aging. The eyelet solder joints did show cracking that most likely occurred {{at the time of}} assembly. The eyelet, SA 1126 connector solder joints, showed some delamination between the Cu pad and underlying laminate. The B 61 field-returned radar solder joints showed a nominal degree of aging. Cracking of the eyelet solder joints was observed. The Pb-rich phase particle measurements indicated additional aging of the interconnects as a result of residual stresses. Cracking of the terminal <b>pole</b> <b>connector,</b> pin-to-pin solder joint was observed; but it was not believed to jeopardize the electrical functionality of the interconnect. Extending the stockpile lifetime of the B 61 tube-type radar by an additional 20 years would not be impacted by the reliability of the solder joints with respect to further growth of the intermetallic compound layer. Additional coarsening of the Pb-rich phase will increase the joints' sensitivity to thermomechanical fatigue...|$|R

Bandung is the capital city of the region of West Java {{and is one of the}} fastest-growing secondary cities in Indonesia. Since it was founded in 1488, Bandung's role has changed twice-first from a primate city to a colonial capital and then to its present-day status as an educational and industrial city. These changes have lead to rapid economic development in Bandung. Because of a lack of planning, the resulting development has been uncontrolled sprawl. This research analyzes the socioeconomic processes that shaped Bandung's spatial characteristics. The research includes thorough historical and spatial analyses. The historical analysis assesses the extent and character of urban economic and spatial changes. The spatial analysis involves the development of a digital spatial database and network modeling. Historical analysis reveals that Bandung has experienced four major periods of historical development including: pre-Hindu (prior to the 1400 s), Islamic and early colonialism(1400 - 1700), colonial partition and penetration (1700 - 1900), and late colonialism and independence (1900 s to present). This analysis reveals the general features of Bandung's urban spatial structure. Bandung's features fit the typical characteristics of urban morphological model of Indonesian cities, which include: a traditional nucleus, kampungs, commercial, industrial, and residential districts. Bandung's spatial growth has been influenced significantly by the governments political and economic decisions from the Dutch colonial period to the present-day. Major political decisions included the establishment of Bandung as a center for education and high-tech industry and its designation as the capital city of West Java. Spatial and network analysis, included spatial interaction and location-allocation modeling, measurement of the level of interactions between activity centers and population poles, the accessibility of each center to the population <b>poles,</b> and the <b>allocation</b> of centers' service areas. The models reveal that flows of goods and people are highly concentrated in Bandung's center because goods and services available in the center. The analysis proposes additions of new retail and industrial centers in the eastern subdistricts to better distribute the flow of goods and people. This redistribution relieves congestion by reducing the length of trips and the number of vehicles on the most congested network links...|$|R
