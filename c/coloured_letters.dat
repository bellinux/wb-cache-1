40|$|Synaesthesia is a {{fascinating}} condition in which ordinary stimuli elicit extraordinary sensory experiences. For example, specific tastes may elicit unusual tactile sensations and standard black letters may elicit highly specific colour experiences. These unusual experiences {{have been shown to}} have substantial impact on cognition, emotion, perception, and covert attention. Two experiments are presented which show that synaesthesia also influences overt visual attention. In these experiments two grapheme-colour synaesthetes viewed <b>coloured</b> <b>letters</b> while their eye movements were tracked. Letters were presented in colours that were either congruent or incongruent with the synaesthetes' colours. Eye tracking analysis showed that synaesthetes exhibited a colour congruity bias – a propensity to fixate congruently <b>coloured</b> <b>letters</b> more often and for longer durations than incongruently <b>coloured</b> <b>letters</b> – in a naturalistic free viewing task. In a more structured visual search task, this congruity bias caused synaesthetes to rapidly fixate and identify congruently coloured target letters, but led to problems in identifying incongruently coloured target letters. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for perception in synaesthesia...|$|E

40|$|Grouping between contra- and ipsilesional stimuli can {{alleviate}} the lateralised bias in spatial extinction (Gilchrist, Humphreys, and Riddoch, 1996; Ward, Goodrich, and Driver, 1994). In {{the current study}} we demonstrate {{for the first time}} that perceptual grouping can also modulate the spatio/temporal biases in temporal order judgements affecting the temporal as well as the spatial coding of stimuli. Perceived temporal order was assessed by presenting two <b>coloured</b> <b>letter</b> stimuli in either hemi-field temporally segregated by a range of onset-intervals. Items were either identical (grouping condition) or differed in both shape and colour (non-grouping condition). Observers were required to indicate which item appeared second. Patients with visual extinction had a bias against the contralesional item appearing first, but this was modulated by perceptual grouping. When both items were identical in shape and colour the temporal bias against reporting the contralesional item was reduced. The results suggest that grouping can alter the coding of temporal relations between stimuli...|$|R

We investigated implicit processing in a neglect patient (JS) using a flanker task in which targets differed on two dimensions simultaneously (i. e. <b>coloured</b> <b>letters).</b> Controls demonstrated interference effects only from goal-relevant dimensions of flankers.

Participants switched between responding to the colour or the identity of <b>coloured</b> <b>letters,</b> and the mapping of stimuli to response keys varied from trial to trial. Results show that responses were faster if the stimulus in trial matched the stimulus in trial n 3, but only if the stimulus response mapping was repeated. This suggests that stimulus codes were still bound to the codes of the response they accompanied 3 trials earlier and 2 task switches ago. Thus, an event file can survive one or more task switches and, thus, may represent a first step towards a more enduring memory trace...|$|E

40|$|Patients {{with right}} {{hemisphere}} (RH) lesions often display a spatial bias in attention towards the ipsilesional hemifield. The behavioural manifestations of this spatial bias are typically interpreted as reflecting increased or enhanced attention for stimuli within the 2 ̆ 7 intact 2 ̆ 7 ipsilesional field, and impaired attentional functioning within the contralesional field. In the healthy brain, goal-driven and stimulus-driven attentional processes interact {{to determine which}} stimuli should be prioritized for selection. Although unilateral brain damage increases the relative attentional salience of stimuli within the ipsilesional field, it might also cause problems in filtering or attenuating task-irrelevant information. We examined whether goal-driven attention modulates the processing of ipsilesional and contralesional information in 6 patients with unilateral brain damage following RH stroke (5 male, 1 female; mean age 60. 8 years) {{and a group of}} age and sex-matched controls. We used a flanker task in which participants made speeded judgements on a central target item (a <b>coloured</b> <b>letter).</b> On each trial the target was flanked by a <b>coloured</b> <b>letter</b> in the left and right hemifields. In separate blocks, participants were instructed to judge either the identity or the colour of the central target and to ignore the flankers. The flanker on one side could be congruent, incongruent or neutral with respect to the target, on either the letter or the colour dimension, whereas the flanker on the other side was always neutral on both dimensions. Healthy controls showed significant interference from incongruent flankers on either side. Crucially, however, this effect only occurred for the task-relevant dimension [F(2, 10) = 24. 60; P < 0. 001]. For patients, however, both the task-relevant and task-irrelevant dimensions of ipsilesional flankers interfered with response times [task-relevant: F(2, 10) = 7. 50, P < 0. 05; task-irrelevant: F(1, 5) = 6. 20, P < 0. 05]. Conversely, contralesional flankers influenced response times only when the target and distractor were incongruent on the task-relevant dimension [F(2, 10) = 4. 85; P < 0. 05]. Our findings demonstrate that following RH damage, goal-driven biases cannot constrain the processing of task-irrelevant features of ipsilesional stimuli. We speculate that a lateralized bias in spatial attention leads to unselective prioritization of all feature-based attributes of stimuli appearing within the ipsilesional hemifield, {{whether or not they are}} relevant to performance. Attentional selection for ipsilesional stimuli in disorders such as spatial neglect and extinction may not therefore be entirely normal, as previously assumed...|$|R
40|$|Synaesthesia is a {{variation}} of normal human perception. A grapheme synaesthete, for example, can experience extra sensations, such as colours when seeing letters and/or numbers. Synaesthetic ability is commonly developed at an early age, and is linked to a genetic pre-disposition; however, there is a learnt component, as one must also learn {{to read and write}} to develop grapheme synaesthesia. To explore the extent to which synaesthesia can be learnt, a training method was employed, which was first used by Colizoli, Murre and Rouw (2012). In order to learn their own <b>coloured</b> <b>letters</b> a group of non-synaesthetic individuals read colour books, which are free eBooks reproduced to have four letters consistently appear in colour. Before and after reading, the participants completed a modified Stroop-design based on Mills (1999), which was used to measure if they had learnt the two key characteristics of synaesthesia, namely an involuntary and automatic reaction to letters. Both the colour reading (n= 15) and control (n= 6) groups did not have a significant involuntary reaction to letters. However, {{it was found that the}} participants had significantly more automatic reactions to letters. This included the control group, who did not read in colour, which suggests that merely completing the modified Stroop test is enough to learn the automatic characteristic of grapheme synaesthesia.

40|$|AbstractIn grapheme-colour {{synaesthesia}} (GCS), {{the presentation}} of letters or numbers induces an additional ‘concurrent’ experience of colour. Early functional MRI (fMRI) investigations of GCS reported activation in colour-selective area V 4 during the concurrent experience. However, others have failed to replicate this key finding. We reasoned that individual differences in synaesthetic phenomenology might explain this inconsistency in the literature. To test this hypothesis, we examined fMRI BOLD responses {{in a group of}} grapheme-colour synaesthetes (n= 20) and matched controls (n= 20) while characterising the individual phenomenology of the synaesthetes along dimensions of ‘automaticity’ and ‘localisation’. We used an independent functional localiser to identify colour-selective areas in both groups. Activations in these areas were then assessed during achromatic synaesthesia-inducing, and non-inducing conditions; we also explored whole brain activations, where we sought to replicate the existing literature regarding synaesthesia effects. Controls showed no significant activations in the contrast of inducing > non-inducing synaesthetic stimuli, in colour-selective ROIs or at the whole brain level. In the synaesthete group, we correlated activation within colour-selective ROIs with individual differences in phenomenology using the <b>Coloured</b> <b>Letters</b> and Numbers (CLaN) questionnaire which measures, amongst other attributes, the subjective automaticity/attention in synaesthetic concurrents, and their spatial localisation. Supporting our hypothesis, we found significant correlations between individual measures of synaesthetic phenomenology and BOLD responses in colour-selective areas, when contrasting inducing against non-inducing stimuli. Specifically, left-hemisphere colour area responses were stronger for synaesthetes scoring high on phenomenological localisation and automaticity/attention, while right-hemisphere colour area responses showed a relationship with localisation only. In exploratory whole brain analyses, the BOLD response within several other areas was also correlated with these phenomenological factors, including the intra-parietal sulcus, insula, precentral and supplementary motor areas. Our findings reveal a network of regions underlying synaesthetic phenomenology and they help reconcile the diversity of previous results regarding colour-selective BOLD responses during synaesthesia, by establishing a bridge between neural responses and individual synaesthetic phenomenology...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{cognitive}} deficits {{are associated with}} aging, including an increased distraction produced by non-target information in the environment. The cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying this deficit are still unclear. Recent event-related potential (ERP) studies show age-related differences {{in the ability to}} suppress the processing of non-target stimuli and the preparation of a response to them. A first study showed an age-related increase in the precentral nogo-P 3 component to non-target stimuli which are supposedly easy to discriminate from target information since they belong to a different semantic domain (numbers vs. letters). This finding was replicated in a subsequent study, in which go and nogo stimuli were matched for frequency and conflict level in order to minimize the impact of task difficulty, probability monitoring, or conflict detection and resolution on the age-related ERP differences. The amplitude of the central nogo-P 3 negatively correlated with go-RTs, suggesting that a partial response preparation to nogo events is strongly suppressed in older adults (as marked with nogo-P 3), especially faster ones. In a third study, despite matched performance in two age groups, older adults showed an early sub-threshold response preparation, as marked with the Lateralized Readiness Potential (LRP), for both high- and low-conflict nogo stimuli. These results indicate that, even without age-related performance differences, older individuals show enhanced response preparation to non-target stimuli that can be detected with more sensitive measures such as the LRP. Negative correlations between nogo-LRPs and P 3 on one side, and go-RTs on the other, in the older group only, suggest that inappropriate response preparation (LRP) and subsequent suppression (P 3) for nogo stimuli is the cost to pay to maintain optimal response speed to targets in normal aging. Corroborating this account, the amplitude of the LRP to low-conflict nogo stimuli was also positively correlated with that of the following nogo-P 3. Do age-related differences in suppressing non-target material impact subsequent performance? To assess this issue, younger and older adults first performed a go/nogo task with <b>coloured</b> <b>letters</b> used as conflicting go/nogo stimuli, and two coloured numbers as low-conflict nogo stimuli. Then, they performed another go/nogo task. A previous number was re-used as a nogo stimulus and the other number as a go stimulus, with new numbers serving as go/nogo baselines. In a first block, younger adults showed transfer costs, that is, slower responses to previous-nogo/now-go numbers than new go numbers, an effect not shown by older adults. These results suggest a tonic suppression of non-target information in younger adults, which gives rise to transfer costs, when this information becomes relevant, while older adults are unable to keep tonic inhibition. In conclusion, the present data show that, to compensate for general slowing, older adults start processing every environmental stimulus, independently of its target/non-target status, and then reactively suppress pre-activated responses to non-target stimuli. Possible underlying mechanisms include a difficulty in maintaining a task-set, for instance by means of a proactive and tonic suppression of inappropriate processing of non-target information...|$|E

40|$|Processes {{underlying}} {{reading in}} profoundly congenitally deaf children were investigated in three experiments using the Stroop paradigm, where subjects {{were required to}} respond to <b>coloured</b> <b>letter</b> strings displayed on a video-monitor. Each experiment examined two response measures: A manual one where subjects pressed the button corresponding to the appropriate colour, and a colour-naming task. Unpronounceable letter strings, pronounceable non-words, colour related and unrelated words were displayed as well as colour words. In both deaf and hearing children of similar reading skill the pattern was very similar. Colour words generated most interference in the vocal, least in the manual task, suggesting automatic access to word meaning (the manual task) and, additionally, to word pronunciation (the vocal task). In a second experiment, where unique letter strings were presented in different colours, the same general pattern was observed: These results {{are not limited to}} repeated associative pairings of colours and their names, suggesting that the deaf, like hearing children, have automatic access to word pronunciations in reading. In a third experiment, non-words that were homophones of incongruent colour words also produced interference with output forms for pronounceable letter strings. Taken together, these results indicate that access to orthographic, semantic and even phonological information can occur automatically when deaf children are presented with written words.

In the present study we examined the effect of vigilance on sustained {{attention in}} a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task in 2 subject groups with labile and stable EEG‐vigilance regulation patterns. <b>Coloured</b> <b>letter</b> streams flickered at 7. 5 Hz and elicited steady‐state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) as an electrophysiological measure of sustained attention in early visual areas. We found that subjects with labile vigilance regulation show 230 Postersitzung 4 significant amplitude increases of SSVEP {{in the second half of}} the experiment. According to the vigilance stage classification, a labile pattern demonstrates a rapid decline to lower vigilance stages (e. g. dominant theta and delta activity in EEG), whereas stable vigilance pattern can be characterized by dominant alpha activity during resting‐EEG. Taking that into account, we further investigated cortical sources of alpha and the externally driven 7. 5 Hz steady‐state signal. We found practically identical cortical sources for alpha and the SSVEP in early visual areas in both groups. These results suggest that the increase in the steady‐state response in the labile subjects is likely to occur due to weaker competition between alpha (10 Hz) with the 7. 5 Hz externally driven network...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Measuring colour {{discrimination}} {{of people who}} carry out tasks where colour is used to convey information and accurate colour judgments are essential for safe and efficient performance of the task is important {{in order to ensure}} that they can carry out the tasks. Individuals with congenital colour vision deficiencies are at a greater risk in making an error in colour judgment and this is the primary reason for colour vision testing in industry. Today, there are a large number of colour vision tests to detect colour vision deficiencies and/or estimate one’s ability to discriminate colours. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine the validity and repeatability of new colour vision test “Colour Vision Reaction Time” (CVRT) for screening for colour vision defect. The study will also determine the repeatability of a selection of clinical colour vision tests, which are currently in use. Material and methods: The test series was administrated to 75 colour normal subjects and 47 participants with red-green defects. Colour vision was classified based on Nagel anomaloscope. In the pseudoisochromatic tests, the Hardy, Rand, Rittler 4 th edition (HRR), Ishihara 38 plate edition and Pseudoisochromatic Plates Ishihara Compatible (PIPC) tests subjects are required to identify coloured figure within background of a different colour. For the Colour Vision Reaction Time (CVRT) test, subjects need to locate a coloured Square on a computer’s screen using a mouse. The Cone Contrast Sensitivity Test (CCST) requires individuals to identify <b>coloured</b> <b>letters</b> that may appear in a gray background on the computer’s screen. A prototype of the ColorDx (pColorDx) test is similar to the printed pseudoisochromatic plates except that the plates are displayed on a computer screen. The Farnsworth-Munsell D 15 (D 15) test requires subjects to arrange coloured caps in order according to colour starting from a fixed cap. Results: The agreement of the printed pseudoisochromatic tests with anomaloscope in terms of screening for red-green defect was good with kappa (κ) coefficient of agreement value of 0. 96 or more on all three tests. The repeatability of the three tests was good with κ coefficient of 0. 96 or more on the three tests. Both HRR and PIPC tests can screen for blue-yellow defects. There were 2 deuteranomalous subjects at the first visit and a different deuteranomalous individual at the second visit who made a single blue-yellow error in the HRR test. In the PIPC test, only one deuteranomalous subject failed the blue-yellow screening plates at the first visit with two errors. In terms of the classification as either protan or deutan, the agreement with the Nagel anomaloscope was perfect with the HRR test and acceptable with the Ishihara, but only fair for the PIPC test. The agreement of the repeatability of the classification was perfect at the HRR test and good at the Ishihara test whereas it was reasonable at the PIPC test. The HRR test was designed to classify the severity of the defect and there was a reasonable correlation between the HRR severity and the Nagel anomaloscope matching ranges. The agreement of the three computerized colour vision tests with anomaloscope was good with κ coefficients ≥ 0. 91. The repeatability of these three tests was good with κ coefficients ≥ 0. 98. All the three tests can screen for blue-yellow defects. In the CVRT test, the response times of most subjects to the blue-yellow test figures were within 1. 0 standard deviation of the white control value. The single exception was deuteranomalous subject who did not fail any other blue-yellow screening test. Ten subjects failed the pColorDx blue-yellow test, whereas 3 subjects failed the CCST S-cone portion. The CCST and pColorDx computer test can classify the defect as protan or deutan. Both tests showed a good-to-perfect agreement with anomaloscope. The pColorDx test can grade the severity of the defect in terms of mild, moderate to severe. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient with the Nagel matching ranges was only moderate. The Farnsworth D 15 test was included to determine whether there was a difference in the pass rate using the results from the first trial or requiring the subjects to pass on 2 of 3 trials. There was a marginal improvement in the pass rate using the 2 out of 3 rule. The repeatability of the 2 out of 3 trails in the D 15 test showed that there was a good agreement between sessions with κ coefficient of 0. 87. In terms of classifying the defect as protan or deutan, based on the visual inspection, there was a good agreement with κ coefficient = 0. 83. However, based on the Colour Difference Vector (CDV) angle parameter, all the colour defective subjects was correctly classified. The repeatability of classifying the type of the defect based on the CDV showed perfect agreement between the first and second visit. The D 15 can classify the defect as mild versus moderate-to-severe. As expected, the majority of individuals who failed the D 15 were classified as having moderate to severe classification on the HRR and pColorDx tests. Discussion and Conclusion: The current study confirms that the three pseudoisochromatic tests are effective in screening for red-green colour vision defect. The HRR test may be preferred over the Ishihara and PIPC because the sensitivity was marginally higher than the other two tests. Agreement of the diagnostic plates with the Nagel anomaloscope as to whether the colour vision defect was protan or deutan varied across tests. The results from this study agreed with the Birch’s (1997) results for the Ishihara in that approximately 85 % of the colour defectives were classified correctly as either protan or deutan. However, HRR classification results were slightly better than Cole, et al’s. In terms of the severity, our results were similar to Cole et al in that there were a reasonable correlation between the HRR severity and the Nagel anomaloscope matching ranges. The three computerized colour vision tests are effective in terms of screening for red-green defects. The CCST had the highest agreement with anomaloscope, but it was not significantly different from the other two tests. However, the pColorDx ability to grade the severity was moderate, but it was slightly lower than the HRR plates. All three tests are capable of screening tritan defects. Our results suggest that a small number of deutans are likely to fail this portion of these tests. The D 15 test showed a reasonable repeatability on terms of pass/fail when we used 2 out of 3 rule and marginally better than performing only one trail on separate days. In terms of the repeatability of classification, the study showed that there was a good agreement between sessions based on the visual inspection and perfect agreement between sessions based on Colour Difference Vector parameters...|$|E

40|$|The patient D. F., {{who suffers}} from severe visual form agnosia, {{has been found to}} have a {{bilateral}} lesion of area LO, an area known to be intimately involved in the perception of object shape. Despite her perceptual impairment, however, D. F. retains residual form processing abilities that can provide distal visuomotor control, for example in the configuration of her grasp when reaching to pick up objects of different shapes and sizes. This dissociation has been interpreted as reflecting the sparing of a dedicated system for processing the physical properties of objects solely for purposes of guiding action. Here we test this hypothesis in two studies designed to examine whether or not spared shape processing capacities might be revealed under other kinds of indirect test conditions. First, we exploited the fact that a redundant shape cue will speed search for a coloured stimulus within an array, and vice versa. Unlike our control subjects, D. F. showed no facilitation effect of either kind. Second, we used two Stroop tasks in which single <b>coloured</b> uppercase <b>letters</b> were presented. Our intention was to determine (a) whether naming the colour would be influenced by whether the letter was the initial letter of the correct or incorrect colour name (e. g. ‘R’ or ‘G’); and (b) whether the reverse might be true, that is that D. F. ’s guesses at letter identity might be influenced by their colour. We found no evidence for a Stroop effect of the former (standard) kind in D. F., but we did find evidence for reverse-Stroop effects. This result may reflect a partial sparing of ventral stream areas specialised for letter-form processing. ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have now}} {{completed}} {{as much as}} I propose {{to say about the}} quaint phenomena of Visualised Forms of numbers and of dates, and of <b>coloured</b> associations with <b>letters.</b> I shall not extend my remarks to such subjects as a musician hearing mental music, of which I have many cases, nor to fancies concerning the other senses, as none of these are so noteworthy. I am conscious that the reader may desire even more assurance of the trustworthiness of the accounts I have given than the space now at my disposal admits, or than I could otherwise afford without wearisome iteration of the same tale, by multiplying extracts from my large store of material. I feel, too, that it may seem ungracious to many obliging correspondents not to have made more evident use of what they have sent than my few and brief notices permit. Still their end and mine will have been gained, if these remarks and illustrations succeed in leaving a just impression of the vast variety of mental constitution that exists in the world, and how impossible it is for one man to lay his mind strictly alongside that of another, except in the rare instances of close hereditary resemblance.|$|R
