40|$|Abstract. Thermal manikin {{tests were}} {{performed}} on selected protective garments to assess their heat transfer properties during exposure to infrared heat radiation. Comparing a newly developed Infrared (IR) Heat Radiation attenuatuion vest with a standard <b>winter</b> <b>jacket,</b> it could be seen that that the IR Vest provided a thermal comfort benefit above a heat radiation exposure level of 150 Watts while the <b>winter</b> <b>jacket</b> provided a thermal benefit above a 450 Watt heat radiation exposure level. The study identified important temperature cross-over points which define the thermodynamic properties and also characterize the heat radiation attenuation and heat insulation properties of garments. The evaluation method {{is seen as a}} new design tool for optimizing garment comfort and safety...|$|R

50|$|Distemper {{was used}} {{extensively}} by German and Soviet forces for <b>winter</b> <b>camouflage</b> during World War II.

Because distemper is water soluble, photographs showing <b>winter</b> <b>camouflage</b> often show it badly eroded.|$|R
60|$|In the {{beginning}} of December Ann Veronica began to speculate privately upon the procedure of pawning. She had decided that she would begin with her pearl necklace. She spent a very disagreeable afternoon and evening--it was raining fast outside, and she had very unwisely left her soundest pair of boots in the boothole of her father's house in Morningside Park--thinking over the economic situation and planning a course of action. Her aunt had secretly sent on to Ann Veronica some new warm underclothing, a dozen pairs of stockings, and her last <b>winter's</b> <b>jacket,</b> but the dear lady had overlooked those boots.|$|R

5000|$|Thinsulate fibers {{are about}} [...] in diameter, which is thinner than the {{polyester}} fibers normally used in insulation for clothing such as gloves or <b>winter</b> <b>jackets.</b> Advertising material suggests that Thinsulate {{is more effective}} due to the increased density of fibers with decreased size of fibers compared with more traditional insulation. Like most insulation materials, the gaps between fibers not only reduce heat flow, but also allow moisture to escape. The insulation properties are beneficial for retaining some of the heat produced by the body for comfortable warmth while the moisture produced, most likely sweat, is supposed to evaporate.|$|R
