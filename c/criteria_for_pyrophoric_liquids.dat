It is a volatile <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>liquid</b> which is used as rocket fuel, and as a reducing agent in laboratories.

50|$|Small {{amounts of}} <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>liquids</b> are often {{supplied}} {{in a glass}} bottle with a PTFE (Teflon)-lined septum. Larger amounts are supplied in metal tanks similar to gas cylinders, designed so a needle can fit through the valve opening.

50|$|TMG is a clear, colorless, <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>liquid.</b> Even the {{hydrocarbon}} solutions of TMG, when sufficiently saturated, {{are known}} to catch fire on exposure to air. TMG is known to react violently with water and other compounds {{that are capable of}} providing labile and active hydrogen (i.e. protons). Therefore, TMG needs to be handled with care and caution, e.g. stored in a cool, dry place at 0-25 °C, under inert atmosphere, and ensuring that storage temperatures would not exceed 40 °C to avoid deterioration.|$|R
5000|$|A {{flammable}} liquid is a liquid with a flash point of {{not more than}} 93 °C. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are {{assigned to one of}} four hazard categories {{on the basis of the}} flash point and boiling point. A <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>liquid</b> is a liquid that, even in small quantities, is liable to ignite within five minutes after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to a single hazard category on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.3.|$|R

50|$|Trimethylstibine is an organoantimony {{compound}} {{with the}} formula Sb(CH3)3. It is a colorless <b>pyrophoric</b> and toxic <b>liquid.</b> It is synthesized by treatment of antimony trichloride and methyl Grignard reagent.

40|$|Pyrophoric {{reagents}} {{represent an}} important class of reactants {{because they can}} participate in {{many different types of}} reactions. They are very useful in organic synthesis and in industrial applications. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) define Pyrophorics as substances that will self-ignite in air at temperatures of 130 F (54. 4 C) or less. However, the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) uses criteria different from the auto-ignition temperature criterion. The DOT defines a pyrophoric material as a liquid or solid that, even in small quantities and without an external ignition source, can ignite within five minutes after coming in contact with air when tested according to the United Nations Manual of Tests and Criteria. The Environmental Protection Agency has adopted the DOT definition. Regardless of which definition is used, oxidation of the pyrophoric reagents by oxygen or exothermic reactions with moisture in the air (resulting in the generation of a flammable gas such as hydrogen) is so rapid that ignition occurs spontaneously. Due to the inherent nature of pyrophoric substances to ignite spontaneously upon exposure to air, special precautions must be taken to ensure their safe handling and use. Pyrophoric gases (such as diborane, dichloroborane, phosphine, etc.) are typically the easiest class of pyrophoric substances to handle since the gas can be plumbed directly to the application and used remotely. <b>Pyrophoric</b> solids and <b>liquids,</b> however, require the user to physically manipulate them when transferring them from one container to another. Failure to follow proper safety precautions could result in serious injury or unintended consequences to laboratory personnel. Because of this danger, pyrophorics should be handled only by experienced personnel. Users with limited experience must be trained on how to handle pyrophoric reagents and consult with a knowledgeable staff member prior to performing the experimental task. The {{purpose of this article is}} three fold: (1) to provide guidelines and general safety precautions to avoid accidents, (2) describe proper techniques on how to successfully handle, store, and dispose of <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>liquids</b> and solids, and (3) illustrate best practices for working with this class of reactants in a laboratory environment...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors' {{goal was}} to {{validate}} the clinical <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> vascular dementia of the State of California Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centers (ADDTC), the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN), DSM-IV, and ICD- 10. METHOD: Sensitivity and specificity were assessed by comparing the clinical with the neuropathological diagnosis of 89 autopsied patients with dementia from a geriatric and psychiatric hospital. All cases were reviewed by a clinician and a neuropathologist who were blind to each other's findings. RESULTS: Neuropathologically there were 20 cases of vascular dementia, 23 cases of mixed dementia, and 46 cases of Alzheimer's disease among the autopsied patients. The sensitivity was 0. 50 <b>for</b> DSM-IV <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> vascular dementia, 0. 70 <b>for</b> ADDTC <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> possible vascular dementia, 0. 55 <b>for</b> NINDS-AIREN <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> possible vascular dementia, 0. 20 <b>for</b> ICD- 10 <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> vascular dementia, 0. 25 <b>for</b> ADDTC <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> probable vascular dementia, and 0. 20 <b>for</b> NINDS-AIREN <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> probable vascular dementia. Specificity was 0. 84, 0. 78, 0. 84, 0. 94, 0. 91, and 0. 93, respectively. The proportion of cases clinically classified as vascular dementia ranged from 0 % to 13 % for neuropathologically confirmed cases of Alzheimer's disease and 9 % to 39 % for neuropathologically confirmed cases of mixed dementia. There was no statistically significant relationship between the neuropathological diagnosis {{and three of the}} clinical criteria sets studied (ICD- 10 <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> vascular dementia and ADDTC and NINDS-AIREN <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> probable vascular dementia). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> vascular dementia are not interchangeable. The ADDTC <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> possible vascular dementia are the most sensitive for the detection of vascular dementia; however, the DSM-IV <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> vascular dementia and the NINDS-AIREN <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> possible vascular dementia may be more effective in excluding mixed dementia. Given their inability to detect the vast majority of cases of vascular dementia, the ICD- 10 <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> vascular dementia and the ADDTC and NINDS-AIREN <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> probable vascular dementia should be revised...|$|R

To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} the diagnostic <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) and microscopic polyangiitis (mPA) proposed by Sørensen et al. in the classification of primary systemic vasculitis (PSV). Methods. We applied to our cohort of PSV patients the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> WG, Churg–Strauss syndrome (CSS) and polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) definitions for WG, mPA and CSS, the Hammersmith <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> CSS and the Sørensen <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> WG and mPA. Results. Ninety-nine PSV cases were identified. Fifty-six fulfilled <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> WG (ACR), 60 for PAN (ACR) and 15 for CSS (ACR). Four fulfilled the Hammersmith <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> CSS. Thirty-nine were defined as mPA (CHCC). Fifty-three patients fulfilled the Sørensen <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> WG and three for mPA.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recently, the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) {{published}} {{an adaptation of}} the previous United Kingdom Brain Bank Society (UKBBS) <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> the diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD).

RESULTS: The recently introduced MDS <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> the clinical diagnosis of iPD include useful novel features (e. g. postural instability is no longer listed as a cardinal symptom, familiar history of iPD and intake of neuroleptics at the first visit no longer lead to exclusion of the diagnosis) and red flags do not lead to exclusion of the diagnosis; however, they must be counterbalanced by the presence of supportive <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> iPD. The <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> identification of persons in the prodromal stage are currently established only for scientific investigations. CONCLUSION: The new MDS <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> the diagnostics of iPD should help to improve the sensitivity and specificity...|$|R
