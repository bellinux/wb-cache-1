Stretch fabrics are specifically used {{in the design of}} active sports clothing, swimsuits, and athletic clothing. In some current uses, power stretch fabrics are required to have higher extensibility and quicker recovery. Compression therapy utilizes medical compression garments and functional body shaping underwear design that are made with high stretch fabric.|$|E

Modified surface characteristics and the effects on <b>comfort</b> along with <b>stretch</b> characteristics impacting on skin pressure are explored. The density and thickness of the spacer yarns affected comfort and compressibility. Fabrics were produced in conjunction with local industry. Used in the DRIFTS concept for tremor suppression, these can significantly {{enhance the quality of}} life. Incorporation of an absorbent interlayer would allow this concept to be used for incontinence products and high performance sportswear...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} linings on comfort were {{investigated}} for pleasantness in texture and movement performance in stretch pants. We conducted wearing tests {{in two different}} patterns. At first, comfort of six same stretch pants, five with different lining fabrics and one with no lining, was compared, Then, another waring test was conducted to compare comfort {{in order to obtain}} data on appropriate selection of linings for closer and looser fitting designs, The results were as follows: 1) Stretch pants with linings gained higher evaluation than pants without linings, in terms of pleasantness in texture, slipperiness on the skin and easiness of body movement. The results revealed that the use of lining fabrics improved the <b>comfort</b> of <b>stretch</b> pants. 2) For pants with relatively sufficient ease, it was revealed that the use of supple and smoothsurfaced linings produced more pleasantness to the skin. It was also revealed that easier vertical slipperiness of the lining towards the body deformation improved mobility. Since human body stretches vertically when in action, less vertical friction with the lining yields easier slippage and mobility. 3) For the linings of closer-fitting pants such as stretch pants, we found that elasticity was more effective than slippage on the skin for maintaining mobility...|$|R

The clean cut, black suit that hung off Dan Quayle’s shoulders and the red patterned tie that was fastened tightly around his neck gave him an air of importance and intellect. William Figueroa, on the other hand, was an overweight Puerto Rican sixth-grader in a plain blue tee shirt who had to travel over an hour by bus to get to Trenton’s Muñoz Rivera School’s spelling bee. "You're close, " Quayle said, "but you left a little something off. The e on the end. " 1 William looked at his vice president, {{the man who was}} second-in-command of the free world, then slowly scratched an “e ” on the blackboard. Moments later at a press conference a reporter entreated Quayle to spell “potato ” and the media debacle began, forever implanting the misspelled “potatoe ” next to Quayle’s name in American history. This, coming only months after millions watched “Danny Boy ” get affronted by Senator Lloyd Bentsen at the vice presidential debate, sparked further questions about whether or not Dan Quayle was competent enough to be the next President of the United States if there was an emergency. Quayle’s embarrassment follows a pattern that appears relatively often in vice presidential memoirs. A young, fresh faced man who has just dipped his feet into politics is suddenly up for the position of vice president. But, upon accepting the great honor that John Adams called, “the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived, ” he suddenly realizes that he is unprepared to handle such a position.

30|$|The {{importance}} of evaluation criteria was hypothesized to positively influence consumer satisfaction with knitwear and negatively influence consumer dissatisfaction. Satisfaction {{was affected by}} only an evaluation of intrinsic criteria, not social and economic criteria. Consumers who importantly considered design, color, fabric, comfort, and workmanship (intrinsic criteria) were satisfied with knitwear products. S d quality. Regarding the relationship between evaluative criteria and consumer dissatisfaction, only social criteria negatively influenced consumer dissatisfaction, while intrinsic criteria had a significant, positive association with consumer dissatisfaction. Interestingly, when consumers considered intrinsic criteria importantly to evaluate knitwear products, they were shown as more likely to satisfy as well as dissatisfy with the products. Especially for knitwear, consumers purchase and wear the products because of its soft texture, <b>stretch,</b> <b>comfort,</b> and insulation (Ryu 2002). Knitwear is much more sensitive to quality and workmanship compared to other apparel product categories (Hong et al. 2002). Thus, when evaluating the knitwear products, the importance may be in its design, color, fabric, comfort, and workmanship. The enhanced perceived {{importance of}} intrinsic criteria by consumers may make them deliberately evaluate the products based on objective information, which makes them more likely to satisfy or dissatisfy. Also, {{there may be other}} variables to explain satisfaction and dissatisfaction better than evaluative criteria such as expectation and disconfirmation (Bearden and Teel 1983; Oliver 1993).|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 This {{study was}} {{developed}} (1) {{to compare the}} durability and <b>comfort</b> of <b>stretch</b> and nonstretch in certain selected denim and gingham fabrics, (2) to test specific designs as to their self-help features and (3) to test special features in the designs which might be adapted easily to ready-made clothing for handicapped children. Two shirt designs and two trouser designs were developed for boys who wore leg braces, had limited finger coordination and had varying degrees of deformity in the shoulders. These designs were then constructed into 16 shirts from woven stretch and nonstretch gingham and 16 pairs of trousers from woven stretch and nonstretch denim. Eight boys, {{ranging in age from}} five to 12 years, were selected from the Children's Hospital School in Eugene, Oregon. Each boy had two outfits of the same design, one of stretch fabric and the other of nonstretch. Each outfit was worn once a week for a total of 12 wearings. All garments were laundered after each wearing by a selected laundress who followed a set procedure. The designs and special features were evaluated by two therapists and the mothers of the eight subjects during interviews with the writer. The writer also held discussions with the children. The fabrics were evaluated by the laundress and the writer by examinations of the garments after each laundering. From these evaluations the following results were apparent: 1. The woven stretch fabrics had better abrasion resistance than the nonstretch when worn over corrective appliances and retained their color and dimensional stability. 2. A pull-over style shirt with a dickey and raglan sleeves was desirable for boys who could raise their arms but had little finger coordination. 3. A shirt with a front opening with Velcro fasteners was satisfactory for boys who had limited finger coordination and could not raise their arms. 4. Raglan sleeves in shirts were desirable for boys with poor coordination and deformed shoulders. 5. Elastic at the waistband of trousers was desirable for those who needed larger trousers to fit over leg braces and pelvic bands. 6. A leg opening closed with a zipper or Velcro was desirable in trousers worn over leg braces...|$|R
5000|$|Korea {{has been}} {{demanding}} official acknowledgement with a sincere apology and {{compensation for the}} [...] "sex slaves" [...] or [...] "comfort women" [...] issue, referring to the women and girls who were forced {{to have sex with}} Imperial Japanese military soldiers during World War II. According to the World Conference on Japanese Military Sexual Slavery, enlisted to the military stations through force, kidnapping, coercion, and deception, the Korean sex slaves, mostly girls under the age of 18, were forced to have sexual relationships with 30-40 soldiers each day. According to the New York Times, [...] "Most mainstream historians agree that the Imperial Army treated women in conquered territories as spoils of battle, rounding them up to work in a system of military-run brothels known as <b>comfort</b> stations that <b>stretched</b> from China to the South Pacific. Many were deceived with offers of jobs in factories and hospitals and then forced to provide sex for imperial soldiers in the comfort stations. In Southeast Asia, there is evidence that Japanese soldiers simply kidnapped women to work in the brothels. Among the women who have come forward to say they were forced to have sex with soldiers are Chinese, Koreans and Filipinos, as well as Dutch women captured in Indonesia, then a Dutch colony." [...] Japanese media attempts to shift blame for the wartime brothels away from the Japanese military onto others, saying, [...] "Prostitution agents were prevalent due to the poverty and patriarchal family system. For that reason, even if the military was not directly involved, it is said it was possible to gather many women through such methods as work-related scams and human trafficking." [...] As the few surviving female victims continue to strive for official acknowledgment and a sincere apology, the Japanese court system has rejected such claims due to the length of time and claiming that there is no evidence.|$|R
