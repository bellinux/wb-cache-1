50|$|<b>Climatological</b> <b>normal</b> is a 30-year {{average of}} a weather variable. Climatological normals {{are used as}} an average or {{baseline}} to evaluate climate events and provide context for year-to-year variability. Normals can be calculated {{for a variety of}} weather variables including temperature and precipitation and rely on data from weather stations. Variability from the 30-year averages is typical and climate variability looks at the magnitude of extremes.|$|E
50|$|Other {{significant}} differences exist {{depending on the}} time period of the data and formula used for calculating growing degree-days. First, to be comparable growing degree-day numbers from various sources need {{to come from the}} same time period. Due to both a variable climate and climate change, a comparison of a ten-year period from the 1970s and the 2000s would be inappropriate as the variation and trends over time would make them incomparable. Furthermore, a sufficient time period is suggested to allow the averaging to smooth out some of the variability. The standard time period in use is the <b>climatological</b> <b>normal</b> period of 30 years, however if 30 years of data is not available then at the minimum five years should be used. However a five-year period is not directly comparable to a 30-year period. How data are averaged (i.e., hourly, daily, or monthly) is also very important. While weather stations today can average data to an hour, a minutes or even seconds, historical data used to calculate growing degree-days has been done mostly on daily or monthly averages (the table above was done using monthly climatological normals). Shorter term averaging to minutes, or more commonly hourly, arguably better reflects the true thermal effects on the crops, but will result in growing degree-day values that are lower than both daily and monthly. Monthly averaged data can be very problematic as it can underestimate heat accumulation during the first and last months of the growing season. Therefore, it is paramount that one know the time period that the growing degree-day values are calculated from so as to be comparable.|$|E

This work aimed to simulate future scenarios of coffee rust (Hemileia vastatrix) epidemics by elaborating geographic distribution maps using a model that estimates the pathogen incubation period and the output from three General Circulation Models (CSIRO-Mk 3. 0, INM-CM 3. 0, and MIROC 3. 2. medres).

30|$|Spatial climate {{datasets}} {{in digital}} form are currently in great demand and gridded estimates of 30 years <b>climatological</b> <b>normals</b> are requested {{by a variety of}} models and decision support tools, such as those used in agriculture, engineering, hydrology, ecology, energy management and natural resource conservation (Daly et al. 2002; Daly 2006). These datasets have to be set up providing a realistic representation of the major forcing factors that affect spatial climate patterns, in order to give reasonable estimates also for areas with poor station coverage, such as high elevation sites in mountain areas (Daly et al. 2008). Beside the spatial distribution of the <b>climatological</b> <b>normals,</b> {{it is also important to}} describe the spatio-temporal behaviour of climate variability and change. It is therefore necessary to set up methodologies that allow for estimating both the <b>climatological</b> <b>normals</b> of any point of the territory and the corresponding long-term records.

As a consequence of these climatic oscillations, it has been pointed out that the <b>climatological</b> <b>normals</b> determined on {{the basis of}} 30 -year record are not necessarily reliable. The relative significance of these climatological fluctuations has been estimated on the basis of comparisons with spatial variations of previously used indicators in the area of Northern Croatia, which can be considered as an area with a uniform climate.

30|$|The basic {{assumption}} of the methodology we use {{to set up the}} grid-cell daily temperature records is that the spatio-temporal structure of the signal of a meteorological variable over a given area can be described by the superimposition of two fields: the <b>climatological</b> <b>normals</b> over a given reference period (i.e. the climatologies) and the departures from them (i.e. the anomalies) (New et al. 2000; Mitchell & Jones 2005; Brunetti et al. 2009; Brunetti et al. 2012). The climatologies, which we produce with the procedure described in Brunetti et al. (Brunetti et al. 2014), are basically linked to the geographical features of the territory, therefore they exhibit remarkable spatial gradients. On the contrary, the anomalies, which we produce by inverse distance weighting, are linked to climate variability and change and are characterized by higher spatial coherence. We reconstruct the two fields in a completely independent way from each other, using different datasets: for the anomalies the priorities are data quality and the availability of long records, whereas for the climatologies the most relevant aspect is the availability {{of a large number of}} stations. In this case, in fact, we consider the issue of record length as less relevant, as a 30 year period is enough to estimate climate normals.|$|R

For this study, we used meteorological data from Abatzoglou and Kolden (2011), who incorporated <b>climatological</b> <b>normals</b> from 2 km PRISM (Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model; Daly et al. 1994), gridded monthly precipitation and temperature data from 25 km Arctic RIMS (Rapid Integrated Monitoring System, [URL] last accessed 10 October 2011), and sub-daily temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity data from 32 km NARR (North American Regional Reanalysis, [URL] Daily temperature (Temp), precipitation (Prec), and relative humidity (RH) were extracted and aggregated within the perimeter of each of the 282 fires. From this set of variables, we calculated the Duff Moisture Code (DMC). The DMC is a component of the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System that incorporates several variables into a long-term indicator of the capacity for the organic soil horizon to burn (Stocks et al. 1989), and is commonly used in Alaska as a proxy for fire potential (Alexander and Cole 2001).|$|R

In GPCC’s 2011 -release, a bulk climatological correction was applied to compensate for gauge undercatch. In this paper we derive an improved correction approach based on the synoptic weather reports for the period 1982 – 2015. The compared results show that the climatological approach tends to overestimate the correction for Central and Eastern Europe, especially in the northern winter, and in other regions throughout the year. Applying the mean weather-dependent correction to the GPCC’s uncorrected precipitation climatology for 1951 – 2000 gives a value of 854. 7 mm of precipitation per year (excluding Antarctica) or 790 mm for the global land surface. The warming of nearly 1 K relative to pre-industrial temperatures is expected to be accompanied by a 2 %– 3 % increase in global (land and ocean) precipitation. However, a comparison of climatology for 30 -year reference periods from 1931 – 1960 up to 1981 – 2010 reveals no significant trend for land surface precipitation. This may be caused by the large variability of precipitation, the varying data coverage over time and other issues related to the sampling of rain-gauge networks. The GPCC continues to enlarge and further improve the quality of its database, and will generate precipitation analyses with homogeneous data coverage over time. Another way to reduce the sampling issues is the combination of rain gauge-based analyses with remote sensing (i. e., satellite or radar) datasets...|$|R

Yet the value is often untapped, owing to the gap between climate science and societal decisions. This study bridged that gap; it determined forecast needs among water managers, translated forecasts to meet those needs, and shaped drought decision making to take advantage of forecasts. NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC) seasonal precipitation outlooks were converted into a forecast precipitation index (FPI) tailored for water managers in the southeastern United States. The FPI expresses forecasts as a departure from the <b>climatological</b> <b>normal</b> and is consistent with other drought indicators. Evaluations of CPC seasonal forecasts issued during 1995 – 2000 demonstrated positive skill for drought seasons in the Southeast. In addition, using evaluation criteria of water managers, 88 % of forecasts for drought seasons would have appropriately prompted drought responses. Encouraged by these evaluations, and the understandability of the FPI, state water managers started using the forecasts in 2001 for deciding whether to pay farmers to suspend irrigation. Economic benefits of this forecast information were estimated at $ 100 –$ 350 million in a state-declared drought year (2001, 2002) and $ 5 –$ 30 million in the other years (2003, 2004).

Although definitions vary depending on the context, drought is generally an extended period of months or years in which precipitation is less than the annual average and results in severe water scarcity (Wilhite 2000; Downing and Bakker 2000; Whetherald and Manabe 2002). According to the World Meteorological Organization (Hounam et al. 1975), droughts are classified as either meteorological (lack of precipitation over a region for a period of time), hydrological (a period with inadequate surface and subsurface water resources), agricultural (a period with declining soil moisture and consequent crop failure due to lack of surface water resources), or socioeconomic (failure of water resources systems to meet demands, which impacts human activities both directly and indirectly). The Kenya Meteorological Service (2010) defines normal meteorological drought as a situation in which rainfall over an area is less than 75  % of the <b>climatological</b> <b>normal</b> (that is, a rainfall deficiency of at least 25  %). This definition is extremely crude as it gives little information about the temporal distribution of rainfall (Wilhite and Glantz 1985). On the other hand, one could define optimal rainfall as sufficient rainfall in amount and distribution over time and space {{to meet the needs of}} specific livelihoods. For the Horn of Africa region, drought occurrence has become increasingly severe during the last decade, with rainfall totals of at least 50 – 75  % below normal encountered in most areas, amounts that are not sufficient to support crop and pasture growth for livelihood security (Nicholson 2014). Studies by Huho and Mugalavai (2010) and Nkedianye et al. (2011) indicate that Kenya has experienced an increase in drought frequency from once in every 10  years in the 1960 / 70 s to once in every 5  years in the 1980 s; the frequency of drought increased to once in every 2 – 3  years in the 1990 s, and has become increasingly unpredictable since 2000. According to the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2012), there is likely to be a marked increase in drought risk over much of Eastern Africa by the 2050 s, which ultimately will threaten climate sensitive economic sectors.|$|E
40|$|O Bordô é, depois do Isabel, o vinho de mesa de maior importância econômica na Serra Gaúcha, pois existe um considerável segmento de mercado que o aprecia, especialmente por seu sabor frutado e por sua cor intensa e matiz violeta. Devido a isso e às condições de estiagem que ocorreram no verão de 2005, quando as chuvas corresponderam a 38 % da normal climatológica, analisaram-se vinhos Bordô do município de Flores da Cunha, RS, um dos mais importantes produtores da Serra Gaúcha. Os vinhos analisados eram varietalmente puros e elaborados segundo a tecnologia de cada vinícola. Avaliaram-se 39 variáveis, das quais os resultados mais expressivos foram os seguintes: álcool 10, 58 % v/v; acidez total 91 meq L- 1; acidez volátil 7, 3 meq L- 1; pH 3, 21; extrato seco 24, 24 g L- 1; açúcares redutores 2, 90 g L- 1; extrato seco reduzido 22, 34 g L- 1; cinzas 2, 09 g L- 1; ácido tartárico 5, 35 g L- 1; DO 420 0, 480; DO 520 1, 296; DO 620 0, 184; taninos 1, 41 g L- 1; antocianinas 778, 8 mg L- 1; etanal 14, 9 mg L- 1; acetato de etila 59, 3 mg L- 1; metanol 290, 9 mg L- 1; 1 -propanol 24, 9 mg L- 1; 2 -metiL- 1 -propanol 40, 6 mg L- 1; 2 -metiL- 1 -butanol 45, 9 mg L- 1; 3 -metiL- 1 -butanol 149, 1 mg L- 1; soma dos álcoois superiores 260, 5 mg L- 1; e K 953 mg L- 1. The Bordô, after Isabel, is {{the table}} wine {{presenting}} the greater economic {{importance in the}} Serra Gaúcha region, {{because there is a}} segment of the market that likes its characteristics, specially its fruity flavor, color intensity, and violet hue. Due to these aspects and to the very dry climatic conditions in the 2005 summer, where rain represented 38 % of the <b>climatological</b> <b>normal,</b> Bordô wines were analyzed from the commune of Flores da Cunha, RS, Brazil, {{one of the most important}} producers of the Serra Gaúcha region. Analyzed wines were varietal ones and made according to the technology of each winery. Thirty nine variables were evaluated and the average parameters of the most expressive ones were the following: alcohol 10. 58 % v/v; total acidity 91 meq L- 1; volatile acidity 7. 3 meq L- 1; pH 3. 21; dry extract 24. 24 g L- 1; reducing sugars 2. 90 g L- 1; reduced dry extract 22. 34 g L- 1; ashes 2. 09 g L- 1; tartaric acid 5. 35 g L- 1; A 420 0. 480; A 520 1. 296; A 620 0. 184; tannins 1. 41 g L- 1; anthocianins 778. 8 mg L- 1; ethanal 14. 9 mg L- 1; ethyl acetate 59. 3 mg L- 1; methanol 290. 9 mg L- 1; 1 -propanol 24. 9 mg L- 1; 2 -mehyL- 1 -propanol 40. 6 mg L- 1; 2 -methyL- 1 -butanol 45. 9 mg L- 1; 3 -methyL- 1 -butanol 149. 1 mg L- 1; sum of higher alcohols 260. 5 mg L- 1; and K 953 mg L- 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis work {{presents}} the bioclimate maps of Jalisco, {{as a result}} of the analysis of its climatic information as well as the <b>climatological</b> standard <b>normal</b> data reported in different localities of the state. Higrotermic comfort conditions for humans were also analyzed based on the previously mentioned information. The definition of thermal comfort was based on Auliciems’ equation (1990). As for the analysis of temperatures and relative humidity, Olgyay's Bioclimatic chart was adapted to the conditions of the various localities of the state. The maps were elaborated with Arc GIS program, and based on the bioclimate study made and presented in the requiring diagrams of air-conditioning. In those diagrams, the conditions of comfort, cool and warm were identified, in order to monthly elaborate maps. After the analysis, It was determined that the problem in the state is warm for most of the year. Reading of maps will permit designers, town planners, architects, mechanicals engineers, and etcetera, to identify the bioclimatic strategies needed to obtain urban planning and architectural results, as well as the use of eco-tecnologies featuring low environmental impact and energy optimization...|$|R

Relacionou as curvas de chuvas intensas para cada estação escolhida e a mudança na cobertura vegetal existente. De posse dos dados de chuvas diárias disponíveis, regionalizamos os dados segundo o estabelecido por Jaime Taborga. Ou seja, utilizamos o conceito de Isozonas de Taborga. Dividimos a bacia do rio Paracatu em 3 isozonas: A, B e, C e D de acordo com as definidas pelo referido autor. Também traçamos, como análise, os dados das estações utilizadas pela sua média aritmética geral. Desta maneira foram produzidos quatro gráficos: 3 de isozonas e um de média dos 16 postos adotados na bacia. Usamos esse mesmo autor e os métodos por ele indicados e transformamos a chuva de 1 dia em chuva de 24 horas. De 24 horas, em chuva de 1 hora e, de chuva de 24 horas em chuva de 6 minutos. Assim fizemos para diversos tempos de recorrência (5 anos, 10, 25, 50 e 100 anos). Recorremos à desagregação com índices de Taborga por reconhecê-lo mais apropriado dado à sua regionalização já estabelecida. Preterimos outros como CETESB, Lobo-Magni, Denver, etc. por entendermos tratarem-se de relações localmente específicas e muito distantes geograficamente da nossa área de estudo. Usamos como opção estatística a Distribuição de Gumbel. Desta maneira, plotamos graficamente os dados de 16 estações, escolhidas como representativas da bacia, tanto geral como por isozona, além de média geral. Isto fizemos para Intervalo de Confiança de 95 % e 90 % (em Anexos). Posteriormente, foram elaboradas tabelas e traçadas algumas curvas de Normais Climatológicas das 16 estações pluviométricas da bacia utilizadas no estudo. (Usamos as Normais Climatológicas existentes no Brasil e aceitas pela OMM Organização Mundial de Meteorologia 1931 a 1960 e 1961 a 1990). Isto para diversos meteoros, assim, comparando-nas com o grau observável imediato de uso da terra para agricultura, principalmente irrigada, áreas de concentrações urbanas, mineração e outras atividades típicas do ser humano e dos nossos tempos. Nossa conclusão foi da relação apreciável e significativa entre as mudanças pluviométricas intensas observadas e mudanças na cobertura vegetal implementadas. Esperamos que este nosso trabalho possa servir de ponto de partida para estudos, análises e projetos de Gestão Ambiental que o Brasil pretende, para o zoneamento econômico-ecológico que se busca, para outras visões e enfoques no sistema de outorga de uso e consumo de água e nova legislação acerca da área mínima de reserva legal das propriedades. Compreendemos que nosso trabalho não é solução, é ponto de partida. This paper aims at {{studying}} and relating {{the changes in}} the intense rain curves in the Basin of Paracatu River in Minas Gerais due to urban and agricultural occupation. It related the intense rain curves for each season chosen and the change caused in the existing vegetation. After having the data of the available daily rain, we adapted it to our region according to Jaime Taborga. That is, we used Taborgas isozones concept. The Basin of Paracatu River was divided in three isozones: A, B and C and D according to the ones defined by Taborga. We also outlined, as analysis, the data of the considered seasons by its general arithmetic mean. Considering that, four graphics were made: 3 of isozones and one of average of the 16 sites considered in the basin. We used the same author and the methods indicated by him and transformed the rain of one day in rain of 24 hours. The rain of 24 hours was transformed in rain of one hour and the rain of 24 hours in rain of 6 minutes. It was done for several periods of recurrence (5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 years). The desegregation based on Taborgas index was used for considering it more appropriate due to its pre-established adaptation to the region characteristics. Other indexes such as CETESB, Lobo-Magni, Denver and others were not used considering the fact that they deal with specific local relationship and they are geographically distant from our area of study. Gumbels Distribution was used as statistic option. The data of 16 sites, which were chosen as representative sites of the basin, were graphically indicated both in general and by isozone, and general average as well. The Confidence Interval of 95 % to 90 % (enclosed) was considered. Afterwards, tables were made and were traced some curves of <b>Climatological</b> <b>Normals</b> of 16 pluvial sites of the basin considered in this study. (Brazils <b>Climatological</b> <b>Normals</b> were used, which are accepted by WMO - World Meteorological Organization 1931 to 1960 and 1961 to 1990). It was taken for several climatical factors, in order to compare them with immediate observed degree of the soil used in agriculture, mainly irrigated areas, areas of urban concentration, mining and other typical activities of human beings and of the modern world. We got to the conclusion that there is an important and meaningful relationship between the intense rainfall changes observed and the changes in vegetation. We hope that this study could serve as point of departure for studies, analysis and Environmental Management projects that are necessary for the economic-ecological division of the areas, other views and focus on grant system of use and consumption of water and the new legislation on the minimum area of legal preserve of the properties in Brazil. We are aware that our study is not a solution but just a point of departure...|$|R
