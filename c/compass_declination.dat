40|$|International audienceIn single-streamer acquisition, {{the use of}} {{acoustic}} transducers {{to constrain}} the receiver positions is not possible, thus implying the use of compass birds to gather information on the streamer location. The compasses are, however, sensitive to the declination of the local magnetic field of the earth, and local fluctuations not accounted for can degrade the accuracy of reconstructed positions. In order to correct these small-scale fluctuations, we propose a simple deterministic method to calculate a spatial correction {{to apply to the}} compasses that enhances the positioning accuracy. The local <b>compass</b> <b>declination</b> is calculated after a first reconstruction on the whole survey area. This method was applied with success to navigation data from a 3 D survey offshore Japan, and the positioning accuracy was improved {{to the level of the}} DGPS accuracy...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the next}} {{eighteen}} months Stirling put forward several {{ideas to the}} Admiralty, including a means of assessing <b>compass</b> <b>declinations</b> at sea and a proposal for improving stowage in warships. [...] He was keen to keep his name in front {{of those in the}} Admiralty who could post him to active service. [...] He had returned from the grand tour short of funds, his father had died in 1823, the family businesses were not prospering and he himself had to make payments to the court in connection with the Hercules case. [...] The competition for preferment from other officers on half pay was intense, so he was fortunate that on 23 January 1826 he was recommissioned and given command of the newly built HMSSuccess.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we are {{discussing}} {{the effect of the}} use of magnetic compasses on the orientation of ancient Chinese architectonical complexes. As Czech researchers proposed in 2011, assuming these complexes ideally oriented by the ancient architects along north-south direction, in the case that the surveys were made by means of magnetic compasses, we can find the axes of the complexes deviating from the cardinal direction, according to the local magnetic declination that existed at the time the structures were built. Following this idea, here we discuss some examples of possible alignments obtained by means of magnetic compasses, concluding that the Chinese surveyors adopted, during the Ming dynasty, a method based on the magnetic compasses. The architects of the antecedent Yuan Dynasty probably used an astronomical method.

5000|$|A {{magnetic}} compass points to magnetic north, not geographic north. Compasses {{of the style}} commonly used for hiking usually include a [...] "baseplate" [...] marked with a bezel that includes a graduated scale of degrees along with the four cardinal directions. Most advanced or costlier <b>compasses</b> include a <b>declination</b> adjustment. Such an adjustment moves the red [...] "orienting arrow" [...] (found {{on the base of}} the liquid filled cylinder that contains the needle) relative to the bezel and the baseplate. Either the cylinder has a mark to read against the scale of degrees on the baseplate, or a separate scale displays the current adjustment in degrees (i.e., the angle by which it has turned).|$|R
5000|$|Other {{features}} {{found on}} modern orienteering compasses are map and romer scales for measuring distances and plotting positions on maps, luminous markings {{on the face}} or bezels, various sighting mechanisms (mirror, prism, etc.) for taking bearings of distant objects with greater precision, gimbal-mounted, [...] "global" [...] needles for use in differing hemispheres, special rare-earth magnets to stabilize <b>compass</b> needles, adjustable <b>declination</b> for obtaining instant true bearings without resorting to arithmetic, and devices such as inclinometers for measuring gradients.

40|$|International audienceLong {{series of}} {{geomagnetic}} field changes {{are important for}} studying processes in the Earth's core. We have compiled 635 historical declination values for southern Germany and surrounding areas. Indirect estimations, including the oldest ones from back in the 15 th century, come from 185 sundials and <b>compasses</b> with <b>declination</b> information, and 15 historical maps. Measurements carried out by monks in the time interval 1668 to 1854 amount to 122 annual mean values and data related to the orientation of mine shafts contributes by 313 annual values for several locations. All these data can be useful to improve historical geomagnetic field models. Previously complied German church orientations, however, are shown to be no reliable sources of the past declination. The compiled new declination curve for Munich shows general agreement with previously published curves for London and Paris and allows to detect geomagnetic jerks with a temporal uncertainty of ± 10 yrs. More or less regular impulses, on a decadal time-scale ranging from 30 to 60 years, are identified {{for most of the}} time interval 1400 to 2000, but the century from about 1760 to 1860 seems to be devoid of sudden secular variation changes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the value of}} teaching map and compass skills in the classroom or an outdoor situation. Navigation is {{the most basic of}} all outdoor skills. A map and compass curriculum can be taught to anyone, is inexpensive, and is easily incorporated in a variety of educational situations. General teaching principles are outlined: (1) start with the basic idea of what a map is; (2) avoid too much detail about compasses with younger children; (3) use a combination of indoor and outdoor settings for teaching; (4) begin with the basics and build on them; and (5) use the utmost care when teaching about declination (the difference between magnetic north and true north). Three methods of adjusting for declination are described. Two teaching scenarios are suggested: a 2 -hour course for younger children that includes map symbols, directions, compass reading, and an outdoor three-leg compass walk; and a 2 -day course for secondary and college students that includes instruction in types and sources of maps, latitude and longitude, UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) coordinate system, map symbols, contour lines, <b>compass</b> reading, <b>declination,</b> and outdoor field sessions. An annotated list of resources includes books, a video, and Internet sites. (SAS) * Reproductions supplied by EDRS are the best that can be made * * from the original document. ...|$|R

50|$|Then to {{make his}} {{discovery}} known to more people he wrote a quality work in English named ‘Magnetic <b>Compass</b> and Its <b>Declination</b> from Standard Directions’. In its introduction he said, “Most of the people do not care to check the Magnetic Compass they use for making out various points of the basement of their structures for Homes or Mosques where accurate directions of cardinal points should be known. They do not consider {{the value of the}} magnetic variation of the place at all while using a magnetic Compass. This aspect was the inducement for the author for endeavor. I have tried, in very simple term in the following pages a brief history of magnetic Compass and clear description of declination of the magnetic needle from the true direction including the method by which to find out the standard direction (cardinal points). This book not only explains the direction and the declination but also guides you to achieve them from their sources.” He later translated this work into Arabic as ‘Al-Buswilatul Mu’antisiyya wa inhirafuha ‘anil jihatil aswliyya’.|$|R

5000|$|Space physics can {{be traced}} back to the ancient Chinese, who {{recorded}} sun spots. The Chinese also discovered the principle of the compass, but did not understand how it worked. During the 16th century, in De Magnete, William Gilbert gave the first description of the Earth's magnetic field, showing that the Earth itself is a great magnet, which explained why a compass needle points north. Deviations of the <b>compass</b> needle magnetic <b>declination</b> were recorded on navigation charts, and a detailed study of the declination near London by watchmaker George Graham resulted in the discovery of irregular magnetic fluctuations that we now call magnetic storms, so named by Alexander Von Humboldt. Gauss and William Weber made very careful measurements of Earth's magnetic field which showed systematic variations and random fluctuations. This suggested that the Earth was not an isolated body, but was influenced by external forces. A relationship between individual aurora and accompanying geomagnetic disturbances was noticed by Anders Celsius and Olof Peter Hiorter in 1747. In 1860, Elias Loomis (1811-1889) showed that the highest incidence of aurora is seen inside an oval of 20 - 25 degrees around the magnetic pole. In 1881, Hermann Fritz published a map of the [...] "isochasms" [...] or lines of constant magnetic field.|$|R
