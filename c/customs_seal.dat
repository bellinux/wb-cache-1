Issues discussed in the {{second round of}} talks were electricity and possibly Freedom of Movement, as well as concluding first round topics such as Kosovo's <b>customs</b> <b>seal,</b> air traffic and Kosovo's participation in regional initiatives. On 28 March, the representative discussed land books and registries of births, deaths and marriages, as well as power supply issues. Stefanović stated that [...] "Certain progress has been achieved on land books, birth registries and electric energy supply; we laid out our proposal and hope that there will finally be a positive wrap-up of these topics at the next meeting".|$|E
50|$|In season two, Russell {{notices a}} broken <b>customs</b> <b>seal</b> on a {{container}} while on patrol and searches the container, finding a hidden compartment filled with thirteen dead bodies of young women. She is briefly the primary investigator until Officer Jimmy McNulty intervened after noticing that the air vent in the container had been beaten shut, getting the case reassigned to the city Homicide Unit and also noticing that the Port Authority lacked the necessary resources to investigate the possible murders. McNulty had previously fished out a fourteenth body while working for the Marine Unit, which was an obvious murder. McNulty largely proceeds with his intervention to spite Major Rawls, who {{sent him to the}} marine unit as a punishment on Season 1. Russell is subsequently detailed to Homicide to aid in the investigation. Initially she shows her lack of experience and street knowledge, but she develops some latent talent for police work while working alongside veteran homicide detectives Bunk Moreland and Lester Freamon.|$|E

50|$|The {{pattern of}} {{repeated}} thefts and brief appearances on campus, {{as well as}} the receipt of letters and postcards from the cannon, continued from the 1970s until the present time (2007). The letters from the cannon would sometimes include photographs of the cannon in remote locations, including Montreal, London, and Paris. It's unclear that the cannon was actually taken to those places, though the shipping case bearing the cannon in 1994 did have Venezuelan <b>customs</b> <b>seals</b> on it. There's suspicion of university complicity in these later appearances and disappearances of the cannon; certainly the November 2007 appearance indicates that the cannon is under university control.|$|R

40|$|This work {{describes}} a route towards an immune protective device for islet of Langerhans transplantation. We developed a protocol to use MIN 6 β cells aggregates as pseudo-islets {{to overcome the}} donor shortage issue (chapter 3). In this thesis we explored two different immune protective strategies; a multibore hollow fiber and flat microwell membranes. In chapter 4 we investigated the possibility to use a commercial multibore hollow fiber. In this chapter we showed that we were capable to physically separate islets using agarose macrospheres. Photoacoustic imaging in chapter 5 confirmed these findings. The flat membrane microwell device was developed based on work of Buitinga et al. (1) who developed a poly(ethylene glycol terephthalate) -poly(butylene terephthalate) (PEOT/PBT) microwell scaffold, made by micro thermoforming of dense thin films. We developed a microwell device that consisted of a thin PES/PVP membrane for islet encapsulation and a 0. 45 μm pore sized PES lid (chapter 6). These membranes were sealed prior to seeding by a <b>custom</b> made <b>seal</b> device. Encapsulated human islets were still responsive to glucose stimulation after 7 days of culture. As a lack of proper vascularization after transplantation and thereby hypoxia is {{a major contributor to}} islet death, we studied solutions to overcome this issue. In chapter 7 we showed that micropatterned membranes in combination with MSCs could be used to enhance vascularization in vivo. Finally, we combined the oxygen generating materials of Pedraza et al. (2) with the microwell membrane device of chapter 6 in chapter 8. We showed, similar to Pedraza et al. that the oxygen generating disk had a positive effect on islet viability and function. In this thesis we took the first steps towards an immune protective device, although successful in many aspects additional work is needed to further optimize the devices developed in this work. Therefore in chapter 9 an outlook is presented of different options in order to reach a functional immune protective device for islet encapsulation...|$|R
40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{reproducible}} method {{was developed to}} detect and quantify carbohydrate-mediated cell adhesion to glycans arrayed on glass slides. Monosaccharides and oligosaccha-rides were covalently attached to glass slides in 1. 7 -mm-diameter spots (200 spots/slide) separated by a Teflon gasket. Primary chicken hepatocytes, which constitutively express a C-type lectin that binds to nonreducing terminal N-acetyl-glucosamine residues, were labeled with a fluorescent dye and incubated in 1. 3 -mL aliquots on the glycosylated spots. After incubating to allow cell adhesion, nonadherent cells were removed by immersing the slide in phosphate buffered saline, inverting, and centrifuging in a <b>sealed</b> <b>custom</b> acrylic chamber so that cells on the derivatized spots were subjected to a uniform and controlled centrifugal detachment force while avoiding an air±liquid interface. After centrifugation, adherent cells were fixed in place and detected by fluorescent imaging. Chicken hepatocytes bound to nonreducing terminal GlcNAc residues in different linkages and orientations but not to nonreducing terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residues. Addition of soluble GlcNAc (but not Gal) prior to incubation reduced cell adhesion to background levels. Exten-sion of the method to CD 4 human T-cells on a 45 -glycan diversity array revealed specific adhesion to the sialyl Lewis x structure. The described method is a robust approach to quantify selective cell adhesion using {{a wide variety of}} glycans and may contribute to the repertoire of tools for the study of glycomics...|$|R
40|$|The Legacy {{engine is}} a {{completely}} new design, transitional diesel engine, replacing the reciprocating engine with a rotary engine. The Legacy engine offers significant advances over conventional internal combustion engines in 1) power to weight ratio; 2) multiple fuel acceptance; 3) fuel economy; and 4) environmental compliance. These advances are achieved {{through a combination of}} innovative design geometry, rotary motion, aspiration simplicity, and manufacturing/part simplicity. The key technical challenge to the Legacy engineâs commercialization, and the focus of this project, was the development of a viable roton tip seal. The PST concept for the roton tip seal was developed into a manufacturable design. The design was evaluated using a custom designed and fabricated seal test fixture and further refined. This design was incorporated into the GEN 2. 5 A prototype and tested for achievable compression pressure. The Decision Point at the end of Phase 1 of the project (described below) was to further optimize the existing tip seal design. Enhancements to the tip seal design were incorporated into the GEN 2. 5 B prototype and tested and evaluated using the iterative research strategy described below. Compression pressures adequate for compression ignition of diesel fuel were achieved, although not consistently in all combustion volumes. The variation in compression pressures was characterized versus design features. As the roton tip seal performance was improved, results pointed toward inadequate performance of the housing side seals. Enhancement of the housing side seal system was accomplished using a <b>custom</b> designed side <b>seal</b> test fixture. The design enhancements developed with the test fixture were also incorporated into the GEN 2. 5 B prototype and tested and evaluated using the iterative research strategy described below. Finally, to simplify the requirements for the roton tip seals and to enhance the introduction and combustion of fuel, a flush-mount fuel injector was designed, manufactured and demonstrated in the GEN 2. 5 B prototype...|$|R
