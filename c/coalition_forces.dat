50|$|The Battle of Lesmont was {{a battle}} of the War of the Sixth Coalition. It took place at Lesmont in Aube on 2 February 1814. A <b>Coalition</b> <b>force</b> of Russians and Bavarians under generals Eugen of Wurtemberg and Carl Philipp von Wrede was {{defeated}} by a French force under general Joseph Lagrange, which managed to destroy the town's bridge and prevent the <b>Coalition</b> <b>force</b> crossing the river Aube.|$|R
5|$|Napoleon withdrew {{back into}} France, his army reduced to 70,000 soldiers, and little cavalry; he faced {{more than three}} times as many Allied troops.

Napoleon won a series of victories in the Six Days' Campaign, though these were not significant enough to turn the tide. The leaders of Paris surrendered to the Coalition in March 1814.|$|E
5|$|The Merlin's first {{operational}} deployment {{was to the}} Balkans {{region in}} 2003.

5|$|After the Cold War, the {{conflict}} in the Middle East triggered a crisis in 1990, when Iraq under Sadaam Hussein invaded and attempted to annex Kuwait, an ally of the United States. Fearing that the instability would spread to other regions, President George H.W. Bush launched Operation Desert Shield, a defensive force buildup in Saudi Arabia, and Operation Desert Storm, in a staging titled the Gulf War; waged by <b>coalition</b> <b>forces</b> from 34 nations, led by the United States against Iraq ending in the successful expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, restoring the former monarchy.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, it was {{announced}} that the Navy's Westland Lynx helicopters would be retired in favour of an all-Merlin fleet. However, the subsequent 2010 SDSR stated that the future naval helicopters would be the Merlin and the Wildcat, a derivative of the Lynx. Royal Navy Merlins have seen action in the Caribbean, on counter-narcotics and hurricane support duties, as well as maritime security duties in the Persian Gulf. Merlins have also seen active duty in Iraq, providing support to British and <b>coalition</b> <b>forces</b> based in the region.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the first}} battle in the War in Afghanistan in which Afghan army units were the {{principal}} fighting force.

Military engagement over Musa Qala {{is part of a}} wider conflict between <b>coalition</b> <b>forces</b> and the Taliban in Helmand. Both before and after the battle, related fighting was reported across a larger area, particularly in Sangin district to the south of Musa Qala.|$|E

5|$|On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention {{declared}} war on Austria. In this War of the First Coalition (1792–1798), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire. Although the <b>Coalition</b> <b>forces</b> achieved several victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and Würzburg, the efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces back and resulted in the negotiation of the Peace of Leoben (17 April 1797) and the subsequent Treaty of Campo Formio (October 1797).|$|E

After bitter fighting in which Oberwinden and Racour changed hands repeatedly, the two villages and Neerwinden were recaptured by Clerfayt's troops. An Austrian cavalry charge pressed back the French even farther. Dumouriez attempted one more all-out attack with his right but it failed. The French cavalry covered the retreat of the infantry, with Chartres and Valence maintaining a position along the Little Gete.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn {{an effort to}} impede the flow of drugs from South America, a <b>Coalition</b> <b>Force</b> headed by Joint Interagency Task Force (JIATF) - South allocates its assets to detect and interdict drug smuggling vessels such as the self-propelled semi-submersible (SPSS) used by a Drug Trafficking Organization (DTO). In this thesis, we develop an interdiction model to place the <b>Coalition</b> <b>Force</b> assets optimally. We also develop a model - known as the Adaptive Evader Model - for a DTO that is able to learn {{the placement of the}} <b>Coalition</b> <b>Force</b> assets. This model is akin to the multiarmed bandit problem. We create two algorithms for the Adapting Evader Model. One algorithm uses an optimal learning policy and the other uses a heuristic learning policy. We also create an algorithm for the interdiction model using the Cross-Entropy method. Finally, we construct a case study that we use to draw some insights about how a DTO, that is capable of learning, reacts to different optimal plans. This information can be used by the <b>Coalition</b> <b>Force</b> to more effectively allocate their limited number of assets during drug interdiction operations. US Navy (USN) autho...|$|R
