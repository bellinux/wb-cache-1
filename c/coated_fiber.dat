50|$|The {{resolution}} of a PSTM instrument is {{highly dependent on}} probe tip geometry and diameter. Probes are typically fabricated via chemical etching of an optical fiber in a solution of HF and can be apertured or apertureless. Using chemical etching, fiber tips with a curvature radius as low as 20 nm have been made. In apertured tips, {{the sides of the}} sharpened fiber are sputter coated in a metal or other material. This helps to limit tunnelling of photons {{into the side of the}} probe in order to maintain more consistent and accurate evanescent field coupling. Due to the rigidity of the fiber probe, even brief contact with the surface will destroy the probe tip. Larger probe tips have a greater degree of coupling to the evanescent field and will therefore have greater collection efficiency due to a larger area of the optical fiber interacting with the field. The primary limitation of a large tip is the increased probability of collision with rougher surface features as well as photon tunnelling into the side of the probe. A narrower probe tip is necessary to resolve more abrupt surface features without collision, however the collection efficiency will be reduced. Figure 3 shows that fiber probe with metal coating. In metal <b>coated</b> <b>fiber</b> probes, the diameter and geometry of the aperture, or uncoated area at the tip of the probe, determines the collection efficiency. Wider cone angles result in larger aperture diameters and shorter probe lengths, while narrower cone angles result in smaller aperture diameters and longer probes. Double tapered probetips have been developed in which a long, narrow region of the probe tapers into a tip with a wider cone angle. This provides a wider aperture for greater collection efficiency while still maintaining a long narrow probe tip capable of resolving abrupt surface features with low risk of collision.|$|E
