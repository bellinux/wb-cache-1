But, after Mendelssohn received the final act, he expressed doubts about the subject, asked Planché to start work on a <b>completely</b> <b>new</b> libretto, and eventually stopped replying to Planché's letters. The opera was never realised.|$|E

The new-found clusters contain {{hundreds of thousands}} of stars, a similar number of stars that can be found in globular clusters.

The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters.|$|E

In a third convoy sailing, a problem with her steering gear caused her to collide with another convoy ship, Empire Scott, and on 1 August Empire Simba straggled and dropped out of the convoy.|$|E

5|$|Distant Worlds II: More Music From Final Fantasy was {{a concert}} in the Distant Worlds series {{featuring}} music from Final Fantasy that was performed on June 12, 2010 in Stockholm, Sweden, just as the first Distant Worlds concert was. Arnie Roth returned to the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra with a <b>completely</b> <b>new</b> program presenting more pieces from Final Fantasy. Simultaneously with the concert, a new CD with the same repertoire was released under the name Distant Worlds II: Music From Final Fantasy. The recording {{was done by the}} Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of Arnie Roth in January 2010. The name Distant Worlds II only refers to the Stockholm concert; the series itself has continued under the original Distant Worlds name with the new arrangements added to its permanent rotation.|$|E
5|$|For the {{original}} Final Fantasy, Sakaguchi required a larger production team than Square's previous titles. He began crafting the game's story while experimenting with gameplay ideas. Once the gameplay system and game world size were established, Sakaguchi integrated his story ideas into the available resources. A different {{approach has been}} taken for subsequent titles; the story is completed first and the game built around it. Designers have never been restricted by consistency, though most feel each title should have a minimum number of common elements. The development teams strive to create <b>completely</b> <b>new</b> worlds for each title, and avoid making new games too similar to previous ones. Game locations are conceptualized early in development and design details like building parts are fleshed out {{as a base for}} entire structures.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, astronomers {{discovered}} a <b>completely</b> <b>new</b> type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy, which is, in several ways, {{very similar to}} globular clusters. The new-found clusters contain {{hundreds of thousands of}} stars, a similar number to that found in globular clusters. The clusters share other characteristics with globular clusters such as stellar populations and metallicity. What distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger – several hundred light-years across – and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters. Parametrically, these clusters lie somewhere between a globular cluster and a dwarf spheroidal galaxy.|$|E

5|$|In March 1928, Pflueger {{published}} his submission {{for a new}} building to house the San Francisco Stock Exchange, featuring strong Zigzag Moderne themes with classicist notes. Miller and Pflueger won the competition for the commission. Eight months later, the Exchange committee decided instead to rebuild the Sub-treasury building at 301 Pine Street while keeping its Tuscan columns and entrance steps, requiring a <b>completely</b> <b>new</b> approach. Pflueger's first response was a sketch with little ornamentation. Construction began in December 1928. By January 1929, Pflueger's plans indicated prominent sculptures, bas-reliefs, inscriptions and carvings, to be detailed by local artists.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, construction of the motorway was further postponed because of onset of the Croatian War of Independence. The decade saw renewed discussion regarding construction of the motorway, including renewed considerations of its route. Soon, the originally devised route running through Bihać was set aside and two new routes were considered: One of them was {{a modified version of the}} original route, bypassing Bihać and running through the Plitvice Lakes region while the other was a <b>completely</b> <b>new</b> route further to the west via Gospić and Zadar, which was eventually accepted for construction. Both of the alternative routes proposed that the Zagreb–Karlovac motorway already completed in 1972 were to be used as the northernmost section of the Zagreb–Split and Zagreb–Rijeka motorways.|$|E
5|$|In these epochs, she was {{not merely}} {{applying}} ideas and methods of earlier mathematicians; rather, she was crafting new systems of mathematical definitions {{that would be used}} by future mathematicians. In particular, she developed a <b>completely</b> <b>new</b> theory of ideals in rings, generalizing earlier work of Richard Dedekind. She is also renowned for developing ascending chain conditions, a simple finiteness condition that yielded powerful results in her hands. Such conditions and the theory of ideals enabled Noether to generalize many older results and to treat old problems from a new perspective, such as elimination theory and the algebraic varieties that had been studied by her father.|$|E
