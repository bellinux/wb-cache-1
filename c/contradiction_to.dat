5|$|In {{addition}} to its mass and modeled geochemistry, researchers have also examined Enceladus's shape to determine if it is differentiated. Porco et al. (2006) used limb measurements to determine that its shape, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, is consistent with an undifferentiated interior, in <b>contradiction</b> <b>to</b> the geological and geochemical evidence. However, the current shape also supports the possibility that Enceladus is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, and may have rotated faster {{at some point in}} the recent past (with a differentiated interior). Gravity measurements by Cassini show that the density of the core is low, indicating that the core contains water in {{addition to}} silicates.|$|E

Randazza wrote that Beck was attempting to evade the First Amendment to the United States Constitution by filing the legal process with an agency of the United Nations instead of in a U.S. court. In the legal brief, Randazza pointed out that Beck's action of going to the WIPO in an attempt to get the website taken down was in <b>contradiction</b> <b>to</b> his prior statements saying he preferred United States law over international law.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{have had}} a strong {{presence}} in many cultures, especially in areas where they form {{the most common type}} of livestock. In the English language, to call someone a sheep or ovine may allude that they are timid and easily led.

5|$|Hume also {{suggested}} that, {{as we have}} no abstract idea of existence (apart from {{as part of our}} ideas of other objects), we cannot claim that the idea of God implies his existence. He suggested that any conception of God we may have, we can conceive either of existing or of not existing. He believed that existence is not a quality (or perfection), so a completely perfect being need not exist. Thus, he claimed {{that it is not a}} <b>contradiction</b> <b>to</b> deny God's existence. Although this criticism is directed against a cosmological argument, similar to that of Samuel Clarke in his first Boyle Lecture, it has been applied to ontological arguments as well.|$|E

5|$|On April 22, 1992, {{less than}} a year after her kidnapping, a man called the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department from a gas station less than two miles from the Garridos' home. The caller {{reported}} that he saw Dugard in the gas station staring intently at a missing child poster of herself. The caller then reported seeing her leave in a large yellow van, possibly a Dodge. In 2009, after Dugard's release, an old yellow Dodge van was recovered from the Garrido property that matched the description of the van given in the call. The license plate was not reported in the 1992 call; the caller, the girl, and the van were gone by the time police arrived. The caller never identified himself, and the police did not pursue the matter any further. In <b>contradiction</b> <b>to</b> this story, Dugard reported that she never left the Garrido property from the day she was kidnapped until shortly before her first child was born in August 1994.|$|E
5|$|The {{embryonic}} individual of Dinocephalosaurus preserved inside LPV 30280 from Luoping can {{be identified}} as such for several reasons. First, it is enclosed entirely within the body cavity of the adult. Its cervical ribs - which are long, {{like that of the}} adult - face the same direction as the dorsal vertebrae of the adult, which is in <b>contradiction</b> <b>to</b> the typical head-first method of swallowing prey among amniotes. It is also preserved with its neck curling towards its forelimbs, a posture which is seen among vertebrate embryos but not adult Dinocephalosaurus specimens, which generally have the neck bent upwards. The absence of hands associated with the forelimbs in the embryo may be an artifact of preservation, but it may also be due to the sequence in which the limb bones of tetrapods ossify.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{hypothesis}} of LDR is in <b>contradiction</b> <b>to</b> some embryological studies on birds which show that, from five developmental sites, the digits that develop are the three middle digits (II, III, IV). This inconsistency has {{been a matter of}} debate for almost 200 years, and has been used by Alan Feduccia to support the controversial hypothesis that birds are descended not from theropods but from some other group of archosaurs which had lost the first and fifth digits. To explain the discrepancy between morphological and embryological data in the context of bird origins, an alternative scenario to LDR was developed by Tony Thulborn and Tim Hamley in 1982. In this scenario, the digits I and V of theropods were reduced in the process of Bilateral Digit Reduction (BDR), with the remaining digits developing to resemble the former digits I-III. Limusaurus was initially considered as evidence for the BDR hypothesis due to it - and other ceratosaurians - having a reduced first digit, with researchers hypothesizing that a similar pattern of reduction occurred among the tetanurans (the sister group of the ceratosaurians).|$|E
