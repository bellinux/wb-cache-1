40|$|Pacific {{business}} sustainability in New Zealand {{is important}} for the economic and social wellbeing of the Pacific Island people who have chosen New Zealand as their home. As with many ethnic minorities businesses overseas, Pacific businesses struggle to survive in a foreign commercial environment that is often not aligned to the value systems and customs of their country of origin. This study seeks to determine the key financial and entrepreneurial drivers of business sustainability for Tongan businesses as a specific group within the Pacific Island business sector. The study takes an ethnic specific view of business sustainability drawing on the experiences of twenty Tongan businesses, three Pacific business consultants and the wider Tongan community. The data was captured in a series of talanoa sessions (a traditional and preferred form of communication based on face to face discussion) carried out in 2006 and 2007. Throughout the study, attention was given to Tongan protocols, cultural nuances and sensitivities to ensure the context in which these Tongan businesses operate was captured. The study concludes by making several contributions to the literature. The first includes the contribution to methodology through to use of talanoa in a business context. The second is the contribution to embeddedness theory through the analysis of specific Tongan business experiences and lastly the empirical contribution to the Pacific Island business literature. The findings have been analysed from a number of perspectives including; financial accounting, business finance, management accounting and business related challenges. The empirical findings highlight that differences in culture and traditional Tongan protocols influence <b>business</b> <b>practice.</b> The impact of Tongan culture on business sustainability is both complementary and inimical. Tongan business sustainability in New Zealand is therefore a <b>product</b> of <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> that incorporate embedded Tongan culture and the western commercial paradigms within which they operate...|$|R
25|$|In {{the context}} of the social web, {{engagement}} means that customers and stakeholders, such as consumer advocacy groups and groups that criticize companies (e.g., lobby groups or advocacy organizations) are active participants rather than passive viewers. Social media use in a business or political context allows all consumers/citizens to express and share an opinion about a company's <b>products,</b> services or <b>business</b> <b>practices,</b> or a government's actioins. Each participating customer or non-customer (or citizen) who is participating online via social media becomes part of the marketing department (or a challenge to the marketing effort), as other customers read their positive or negative comments or reviews. Getting consumers and potential consumers (or citizens) to be engaged online is fundamental to successful social media marketing. With the advent of social media marketing, it has become increasingly important to gain customer interest in products and services, which can eventually be translated into buying behavior (or voting or donating behavior in a political context). New online marketing concepts of engagement and loyalty have emerged which aim to build customer participation and brand reputation.|$|R
40|$|After {{the rapid}} success of {{microcredit}} and, {{to a lesser}} extent, microsavings in the past decades, microinsurance has been the third financial service to enter emerging financial markets in the developing world. Microinsurance could provide high welfare gains, given that low-income people often lack efficient strategies to manage and cope with risks, such as death, illness, old age, droughts or floods. In light of the low coverage of public security systems in many developing countries, {{it is seen as}} a promising innovation that could offer better protection for low-income people. However, {{little is known about the}} factors that constrain or facilitate demand to translate into uptake of microinsurance and on the <b>product</b> characteristics and <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> that create value for them. This thesis applies quantitative econometric and qualitative methods – based on own household and individual survey data as well as focus group discussions – to investigate participation patterns and perceived value in micro life insurance in Ghana. The results reveal, first, that household uptake of micro life insurance does not entirely follow the predictions made by standard insurance theories. Informal trust-buildin...|$|R

According to the New York Times, this has {{made it hard to}} tell the difference between [...] "popular sentiment" [...] and [...] "manufactured public opinion."

The authors argued that astroturfing that is [...] "purposefully designed to fulfill corporate agendas, manipulate public opinion and harm scientific research represents a serious lapse in ethical conduct." [...] A 2011 report found that often paid posters from competing companies are attacking each other in forums and overwhelming regular participants in the process. George Monbiot said that persona-management software supporting astroturfing [...] "could destroy the Internet as a forum for constructive debate." [...] An article in the Journal of Consumer Policy said that regulators and policy makers needed to be more aggressive about astroturfing.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the costs of}} (partial) institutional harmonization with the EU acquis which countries of the former USSR are expected to conduct under their Partnership and Cooperation Agreements with the EU and European Neighborhood Policy Action Plans.

Yet, the major part of the adjustment costs will fall on the private sector, as enterprises will have to make substantial investments to comply with new <b>product</b> requirements and <b>business</b> <b>practices.</b> In this study we used the method of extrapolation of average costs for CEE countries' harmonization with acquis to estimate the potential harmonization costs for the neighboring countries based on internationally comparative macroeconomic indicators like sectoral and total value added. This involved estimating the EU pre-accession support for the CEE countries by main areas {{as a percentage of the}} total or sectoral value added, determining the expected degree of limited harmonization in the ENP countries and estimating "coefficients of limited harmonization", which was subsequently used for adjustment of the estimated cost of full harmonization.
