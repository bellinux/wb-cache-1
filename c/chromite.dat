5|$|Chromium is mined as <b>chromite</b> (FeCr2O4) ore. About two-fifths of the <b>chromite</b> ores and {{concentrates}} in {{the world}} are produced in South Africa, while Kazakhstan, India, Russia, and Turkey are also substantial producers. Untapped <b>chromite</b> deposits are plentiful, but geographically concentrated in Kazakhstan and southern Africa.|$|E
5|$|Chromium was {{discovered}} {{as an element}} after {{it came to the}} attention of the Western world in the red crystalline mineral crocoite (lead(II) chromate), discovered in 1761 and initially used as a pigment. Nearly all chromium is commercially extracted from the single commercially viable ore <b>chromite,</b> which is iron chromium oxide (FeCr2O4). <b>Chromite</b> is now the principal source of chromium for pigments.|$|E
5|$|During the 1800s, {{chromium}} {{was primarily}} {{used as a}} component of paints and in tanning salts. At first, crocoite from Russia was the main source, but in 1827, a larger <b>chromite</b> deposit was discovered near Baltimore, United States. This made the United States the largest producer of chromium products till 1848 when large deposits of <b>chromite</b> were found near Bursa, Turkey.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chromium}} compounds {{are used}} as catalysts for processing hydrocarbons. For example, the Phillips catalyst, prepared from chromium oxides, {{is used for the}} production of about half the world's polyethylene. Fe-Cr mixed oxides are employed as high-temperature catalysts for the water gas shift reaction. Copper <b>chromite</b> is a useful hydrogenation catalyst.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{products}} of chromium ore refining are ferrochromium and metallic chromium. For those products the ore smelter process differs considerably. For {{the production of}} ferrochromium, the <b>chromite</b> ore (FeCr2O4) is reduced in large scale in electric arc furnace or in smaller smelters with either aluminium or silicon in an aluminothermic reaction.|$|E
5|$|Ferrochromium alloy is commercially {{produced}} from <b>chromite</b> by silicothermic or aluminothermic reactions and chromium metal by roasting and leaching processes followed by reduction with carbon and then aluminium. Chromium metal is of high value for its high corrosion resistance and hardness. A major development was {{the discovery that}} steel could be made highly resistant to corrosion and discoloration by adding metallic chromium to form stainless steel. Stainless steel and chrome plating (electroplating with chromium) together comprise 85% of the commercial use.|$|E
5|$|For the {{production}} of pure chromium, the iron must {{be separated from the}} chromium in a two step roasting and leaching process. The <b>chromite</b> ore is heated with a mixture of calcium carbonate and sodium carbonate in the presence of air. The chromium is oxidized to the hexavalent form, while the iron forms the stable Fe2O3. The subsequent leaching at higher elevated temperatures dissolves the chromates and leaves the insoluble iron oxide. The chromate is converted by sulfuric acid into the dichromate.|$|E
5|$|INGEMMET (Instituto Geológico Minero y Metalúrgico) of Peru {{released}} internally on September 21 {{a report}} on the Carancas meteorite fall. The release of the document to the public was delayed for one week. The researchers found that the fragments from the crater zone had a chondritic texture and the following mineral composition: pyroxene (1) 40%, olivine 20%, feldspar 10%, pyroxene (2) 10%; kamacite 15%, troilite 5%, and traces of <b>chromite</b> and native copper. Kamacite occurs naturally only in meteorites.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{chromate}} {{is produced}} industrially by the oxidative roasting of <b>chromite</b> ore with calcium or sodium carbonate. The dominant species is therefore, {{by the law}} of mass action, determined by the pH of the solution. The change in equilibrium is visible by a change from yellow (chromate) to orange (dichromate), such as when an acid is added to a neutral solution of potassium chromate. At yet lower pH values, further condensation to more complex oxyanions of chromium is possible.|$|E
5|$|The attacks caught UN {{planners}} and troops by surprise. By August 26, the UN troops {{believed they had}} destroyed the last serious threats to the perimeter, and anticipated the war ending by late November. ROK units, in the meantime, suffered from low morale thanks to their failures to defend effectively thus far in the conflict. UN troops were looking ahead to Operation <b>Chromite,</b> their amphibious assault far behind North Korean lines {{at the port of}} Inchon on September 15, and did not anticipate the North Koreans would mount a serious offensive before then.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{volcanic}} {{nature of the}} islands, mineral deposits are abundant. The country is estimated to have the second-largest gold deposits after South Africa {{and one of the}} largest copper deposits in the world. It is also rich in nickel, <b>chromite,</b> and zinc. Despite this, poor management, high population density, and environmental consciousness have resulted in these mineral resources remaining largely untapped. Geothermal energy is a product of volcanic activity that the Philippines has harnessed more successfully. The Philippines is the world's second-biggest geothermal producer behind the United States, with 18% of the country's electricity needs being met by geothermal power.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar {{has one of}} the world's largest {{reserves}} of ilmenite (titanium ore), as well as important {{reserves of}} <b>chromite,</b> coal, iron, cobalt, copper and nickel. Several major projects are underway in the mining, oil and gas sectors that are anticipated to give a significant boost to the Malagasy economy. These include such projects as ilmenite and zircon mining from heavy mineral sands near Tôlanaro by Rio Tinto, extraction of nickel near Moramanga and its processing near Toamasina by Sherritt International, and the development of the giant onshore heavy oil deposits at Tsimiroro and Bemolanga by Madagascar Oil.|$|E
5|$|The attacks caught UN {{planners}} and troops by surprise. By August 26, the UN troops {{thought they had}} destroyed the last serious threats to the perimeter, and anticipated the war ending by late November. ROK units, in the meantime, suffered from low morale {{as a result of}} their failures to defend effectively thus far in the conflict, and a cautious US Eighth Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker ordered Major General John B. Coulter to the P'ohang-dong area to shore up the ROK I Corps, which was falling apart due to low morale. UN troops were preparing for Operation <b>Chromite,</b> an amphibious assault on the port of Inchon on September 15, and did not anticipate that the North Koreans would mount a serious offensive before then.|$|E
5|$|Through {{his social}} {{contacts}} Widmerpool secures {{a job in}} the politico-legal department of the Donners-Brebner industrial conglomerate, a post that brings him into close contact with Sir Magnus Donners, for whom he exhibits a respect bordering on reverence. He develops a talent for intrigue, which irritates Sir Magnus to the extent that Widmerpool is asked to leave the organisation. He joins a City firm of bill-brokers and still under the age of 30, becomes an influential and respected figure in the financial world. By the late 1930s, Widmerpool is advising Donners-Brebner again. Just before the outbreak of war in September 1939, he oversees a scheme on behalf of Donners to corner the Turkish market in <b>chromite</b> and emerges unscathed when the project collapses.|$|E
5|$|Dean {{later said}} {{he had tried to}} commit suicide because he feared he would break under torture and divulge {{critical}} intelligence to the North Koreans. He had been aware of the plans for Operation <b>Chromite,</b> and feared he would reveal the information to the North Koreans under torture. Still he remained defiant during interrogations, refusing to divulge any information and acting unafraid, sometimes laughing off threats. He was given better treatment than most UN prisoners in North Korea, as he was regularly fed and rarely subjected to interrogations after his initial capture. He tried several times to escape but failed in doing so. He may have been moved to Manpo when the UN forces took P'yongyang, and returned when the Chinese People's Liberation Army entered the war and forced the UN forces back.|$|E
5|$|The first European Americans {{to visit}} the area were a group of fur trappers led by Peter Skene Ogden in 1827. The {{community}} of Buncom was founded by Chinese miners in 1851 when gold, silver, cinnabar, and <b>chromite</b> were discovered in nearby Jacksonville. In the spring of 1854, James Sterling and Aaron Davis discovered gold in the Sterling Creek area, and hundreds of miners soon arrived. The town of Sterlingville was founded, and by October its population had risen to over 1,500. Mining lasted through the 1850s and 1860s, {{and much of the}} riverbeds of Sterling Creek and the lower Little Applegate River were excavated. The Sterling Ditch and several other ditches were constructed in the 1870s, providing water to large hydraulic mining operations in Sterlingville and surrounding regions. The Sterlingville mine quickly became the largest hydraulic mine in Oregon, and possibly the entire western United States.|$|E
5|$|The magma in {{volcanic}} pipes {{is usually}} {{one of two}} characteristic types, which cool into igneous rock known as either kimberlite or lamproite. The magma itself does not contain diamond; instead, it acts as an elevator that carries deep-formed rocks (xenoliths), minerals (xenocrysts), and fluids upward. These rocks are characteristically rich in magnesium-bearing olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole minerals which are often altered to serpentine by heat and fluids during and after eruption. Certain indicator minerals typically occur within diamantiferous kimberlites and are used as mineralogical tracers by prospectors, who follow the indicator trail back to the volcanic pipe which may contain diamonds. These minerals are rich in chromium (Cr) or titanium (Ti), elements which impart bright colors to the minerals. The most common indicator minerals are chromium garnets (usually bright red chromium-pyrope, and occasionally green ugrandite-series garnets), eclogitic garnets, orange titanium-pyrope, red high-chromium spinels, dark <b>chromite,</b> bright green chromium-diopside, glassy green olivine, black picroilmenite, and magnetite. Kimberlite deposits are known as blue ground for the deeper serpentinized part of the deposits, or as yellow ground for the near surface smectite clay and carbonate weathered and oxidized portion.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{paired with}} the 1st Marine Division under X Corps {{to participate in}} the Inchon Landing, code named Operation <b>Chromite.</b> The two divisions would be supported by the 3rd Infantry Division in reserve. Supported by 230 ships of the US Navy, X Corps began landing at Inchon on 15 September 1950, catching the North Korean Army by surprise. The 7th Infantry Division began landing on 18 September, after the 1st Marine Division, securing its right flank. X Corps quickly advanced to Seoul, and the 1st Marine Division attacked the 20,000 defenders of the city from the north and southwest, while the 7th Infantry Division's 32nd Infantry Regiment attacked from the southeast. The 31st Infantry followed behind. Seoul fell to the Americans after suffering moderate casualties, particularly for the Marines. The division then began advancing south to cut off North Korean supply routes. The 32nd Infantry crossed the Han River on 25 September to create a bridgehead, and the next day, the division advanced to 30 miles south of Seoul and linked up with the 1st Cavalry Division at Osan. Radio miscommunication and attack from nearby North Korean forces caused a miscommunication, the soldiers of the 1st Cavalry and 7th Infantry briefly engaged in a small-arms firefight with one another, unable to communicate. Seoul was liberated one day later with the help of air assets from the 1st Cavalry Division. The combined forces of the Eighth Army cut off and captured retreating North Korean troops from Pusan. X Corps was kept separate {{from the rest of the}} Eighth Army to avoid placing a burden on the logistical system. It withdrew back through the ports of Inchon and Pusan, as part of a plan to conduct another amphibious assault in North Korea. The entire battle for Inchon and Seoul cost the division 106 killed, 411 wounded and 57 missing American soldiers, and 43 killed, 102 wounded South Korean soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The mineral {{crocoite}} (lead chromate PbCrO4) {{was used}} as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant <b>chromite,</b> chrome yellow was, together with cadmium yellow, one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the US and for Postal Service (for example Deutsche Post) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or alternatives free from lead and chromium. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, the bright red pigment chrome red, which is a basic lead chromate (PbCrO4·Pb(OH)2). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate. A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pretreating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of polyvinyl butyral. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of Prussian blue and chrome yellow, while the chrome oxide green is chromium(III) oxide.|$|E
25|$|Magnetite, <b>chromite</b> and {{ilmenite}} are Fe-spinel group minerals {{found in}} many rocks but rarely as a major component in non-ultramafic rocks. In these rocks, high concentrations of magmatic magnetite, <b>chromite</b> and ilmenite provide a reduced matrix which may allow abiotic cracking of methane to higher hydrocarbons during hydrothermal events.|$|E
25|$|Layered {{intrusions}} with cumulate peridotite {{are typically}} associated with sulfide or <b>chromite</b> ores. Sulfides associated with peridotites form nickel ores and platinoid metals; most of the platinum used {{in the world today}} is mined from the Bushveld Igneous Complex in South Africa and the Great Dyke of Zimbabwe. The <b>chromite</b> bands found in peridotites are the world's major source of chromium.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chromite</b> was mined at Soldiers Delight NEA until 1860 by Isaac Tyson, {{and some}} of the old mine shafts are still present.|$|E
25|$|The {{pristine}} volcanic mineralogy of komatiites {{is composed}} of forsteritic olivine (Fo90 and upwards), calcic and often chromian pyroxene, anorthite (An85 and upwards) and <b>chromite.</b>|$|E
25|$|Magnesium-rich olivine forms a large {{proportion}} of peridotite, and so magnesium content is high. Layered igneous complexes have much more varied compositions, depending on the fractions of pyroxenes, <b>chromite,</b> plagioclase, and amphibole. Minor minerals and mineral groups in peridotite include plagioclase, spinel (commonly the mineral <b>chromite),</b> garnet (especially the mineral pyrope), amphibole, and phlogopite. In peridotite, plagioclase is stable at relatively low pressures (crustal depths), aluminous spinel at higher pressures (to depths of 60km or so), and garnet at yet higher pressures.|$|E
25|$|The {{region is}} {{noted for its}} wood based economy, its {{extensive}} water resources and its rich mineral deposits such as iron, gold, silver, nickel, <b>chromite,</b> manganese and copper. Its leading crops are palay, banana and coconut.|$|E
25|$|There {{is hardly}} {{significant}} mining to be mentioned. Coal mines {{have been discovered}} in the disputed area of Neeli Kach Tehsil Wanna. Copper is found in Preghal and Spin Kamar. <b>Chromite</b> in area Sarah Khuara near Dre Nashter.|$|E
25|$|Primary (magmatic) mineral species also {{encountered}} in komatiites include olivine, the pyroxenes augite, pigeonite and bronzite, plagioclase, <b>chromite,</b> ilmenite and rarely pargasitic amphibole. Secondary (metamorphic) minerals include serpentine, chlorite, amphibole, sodic plagioclase, quartz, iron oxides and rarely phlogopite, baddeleyite, and pyrope or hydrogrossular garnet.|$|E
25|$|Uvarovite is a calcium {{chromium}} garnet {{with the}} formula Ca3Cr2(SiO4)3. This {{is a rather}} rare garnet, bright green in color, usually found as small crystals associated with <b>chromite</b> in peridotite, serpentinite, and kimberlites. It is found in crystalline marbles and schists in the Ural mountains of Russia and Outokumpu, Finland.|$|E
25|$|Ultramafic {{mineralogy}} {{is especially}} susceptible to retrograde metamorphism, especially when water is present. Few komatiite sequences display even pristine metamorphic assembages, with most metamorphic olivine replaced by serpentine, anthophyllite, talc or chlorite. Pyroxene tends to retrogress to actinolite-cummingtonite or chlorite. <b>Chromite</b> may hydrothermally alter to stichtite, and pentlandite may retrogress into millerite or heazlewoodite.|$|E
25|$|Serpentinites {{are ideal}} rocks to host this process {{as they are}} formed from peridotites and dunites, rocks which contain greater than 80% olivine and usually a {{percentage}} of Fe-Ti spinel minerals. Most olivines also contain high nickel concentrations (up to several percent) and may also contain <b>chromite</b> or chromium as a contaminant in olivine, providing the needed transition metals.|$|E
25|$|Ideally, the stratigraphic {{sequence}} of an ultramafic-mafic intrusive complex consists of ultramafic peridotites and pyroxenites with associated chromitite layers toward the base with more mafic norites, gabbros and anorthosites {{in the upper}} layers. Some include diorite, and granophyre {{near the top of}} the bodies. Orebodies of platinum group elements, <b>chromite,</b> magnetite, and ilmenite are often associated with these rare intrusions.|$|E
25|$|Monominerallic cumulate layers are common. These may be {{economically}} important, for instance magnetite and ilmenite layers {{are known to}} form titanium, vanadium deposits such as at Windimurra intrusion and hard-rock iron deposits (such as at Savage River, Tasmania). <b>Chromite</b> layers are associated with platinum-palladium group element (PGE) deposits, {{the most famous of}} these being the Merensky Reef in the Bushveld Igneous Complex.|$|E
25|$|Antique has {{deposits}} of metallic and non-metallic mineral resources. The metallic mineral resources include copper, gold, <b>chromite,</b> pyrite, iron, manganese and ferro alloy and limestone. Copper deposits in Barbaza and San Remigio {{are estimated to}} have a volume of 36,255 metric tons and 59,445 metric tons respectively. Pyrite deposits in Valderrama and Sibalom are estimated at 120,000 metric tons while limestone deposits in Culasi are estimated at 30 billion metric tons.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{population}} of the region is engaged in agriculture; cereals, oilseeds, cotton, and pulses (legumes) are the major crops. There are multipurpose irrigation and hydroelectric-power projects, including the Pochampad, Bhaira Vanitippa, and Upper Pennai Aaru. Industries (located in Hyderabad, Warangal, and Kurnool) produce cotton textiles, sugar, foodstuffs, tobacco, paper, machine tools, and pharmaceuticals. Cottage industries are forest-based (timber, firewood, charcoal, bamboo products) and mineral-based (asbestos, coal, <b>chromite,</b> iron ore, mica, and kyanite).|$|E
25|$|Palawan's {{economy is}} {{basically}} agricultural. The three major crops are palay, corn and coconut. Mineral resources include nickel, copper, manganese, and <b>chromite.</b> Logging {{is also a}} major industry. Palawan {{has one of the}} richest fishing grounds in the country. About 45% of Manila's supply of fish comes from here. Having natural gas reserves of approximately 30,000 trillion cubic feet, the province is the only oil-producing province in the country. In addition, tourism is also a thriving sector.|$|E
25|$|African mineral {{reserves}} rank {{first or}} second for bauxite, cobalt, diamonds, phosphate rocks, platinum-group metals (PGM), vermiculite, and zirconium. Many other minerals are also present in quantity. The 2005 share of world production from African soil is the following: bauxite 9%; aluminium 5%; <b>chromite</b> 44%; cobalt 57%; copper 5%; gold 21%; iron ore 4%; steel 2%; lead (Pb) 3%; manganese 39%; zinc 2%; cement 4%; natural diamond 46%; graphite 2%; phosphate rock 31%; coal 5%; mineral fuels (including coal) & petroleum 13%; uranium 16%.|$|E
