In the first, Guilhem criticises contemporary {{politics and}} religion as too worldly, relating {{them to the}} sorry state of the Holy Land at the time. In the second, inspired by piety, Guilhem blames internal wars in Christendom for {{the failures of the}} Crusades. He also suggests that the mendicant orders are partly to blame. It is universally agreed that this song was written after the loss of Jerusalem in 1244. Some scholars place it in the years 1245 - 58 (C. Fabre) or 1254 - 1269 (Karl Appel, Sergio Vatteroni). During the pontificate of Clement IV (1264 - 68) the wars between the Guelphs and Ghibellines were intense. Guilhem reveals his Ghibelline sympathies when he heaps especial blame on the pope, remarking that the pontiff himself has never led a crusade. Because of this reference to the pope, Guilhem's song cannot have been written during the papal interregnum of 1268 - 71. Scholar Amos Parducci suggests that it was written during the War of the Sicilian Vespers, as late as 1284 - 85.|$|E
