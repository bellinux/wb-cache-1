5|$|The {{sound effects}} were {{designed}} by Star Wars veteran Ben Burtt. Whereas the phaser blast noises from the television series were derived from The War of the Worlds (1953), Burtt made his phaser sounds more like his blasters from Star Wars, because Abrams' depiction of phasers were closer to the blasters' bullet-like fire, rather than the steady beams of energy in previous Star Trek films. Burtt reproduced the classic photon torpedo and warp drive sounds: he tapped a long spring against a <b>contact</b> <b>microphone,</b> and combined that with cannon fire. Burtt used a 1960s oscillator to create a musical and emotional hum to the warping and transporting sounds.|$|E
25|$|Detection of {{pressure}} {{variations in the}} form of sound is the most common sensor application, e.g. piezoelectric microphones (sound waves bend the piezoelectric material, creating a changing voltage) and piezoelectric pickups for acoustic-electric guitars. A piezo sensor attached to the body of an instrument is known as a <b>contact</b> <b>microphone.</b>|$|E
25|$|A <b>contact</b> <b>microphone</b> {{picks up}} {{vibrations}} {{directly from a}} solid surface or object, as opposed to sound vibrations carried through air. One use for this is to detect sounds of a very low level, such as those from small objects or insects. The microphone commonly consists of a magnetic (moving coil) transducer, contact plate and contact pin. The contact plate is placed directly on the vibrating part of a musical instrument or other surface, and the contact pin transfers vibrations to the coil. Contact microphones {{have been used to}} pick up the sound of a snail's heartbeat and the footsteps of ants. A portable version of this microphone has recently been developed. A throat microphone is a variant of the <b>contact</b> <b>microphone</b> that picks up speech directly from a person's throat, which it is strapped to. This lets the device be used in areas with ambient sounds that would otherwise make the speaker inaudible.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2014 {{review for}} Uncut, Richard Williams said {{that just as}} the Beatles' fan-club Christmas records were {{inspired}} by the Goons, Harrison's inspiration for Electronic Sound {{appears to have been}} [...] "another BBC institution of their formative years: the Radiophonic Workshop". According to Williams, the album conveys [...] "the joy of a boy with a new toy" [...] and [...] "sounds like what you might get if you taped a <b>contact</b> <b>microphone</b> to the stomach of a digestively challenged robot". He concluded by saying that the self-deprecating sleeve note from Arthur Wax [...] "still sums it up". Scott Elingburg of PopMatters welcomed its Apple Years reissue and described the album as the artist's [...] "most 'experimental' work" [...] and, like the remastered Wonderwall Music, [...] "raw and gorgeous, alive and capable of sparking ingenuity". He said that while Harrison was [...] "no Brian Eno or Jeff Lynne" [...] in terms of synthesizer innovation, [...] "the intention behind Electronic Sound is one of exploration and discovery, an artist limbering up his musical mind to discover how far the boundaries of modern instrumentation could take him. Out of context, Electronic Sound would sound maudlin, even dull. Here, as a key step in the progression of Harrison the solo artist, it sounds audacious in its primitiveness ..." ...|$|E
40|$|Speech {{intelligibility}} {{of signals}} obtained with an acoustic microphone and {{three types of}} vibration-driven <b>contact</b> <b>microphones</b> was assessed using the Diagnostic Rhyme Test (DRT). Stimulus words were recorded digitally in a reverberant chamber with no noise and with ambient broadband noise intensity at 106 dB(A). Listeners completed the DRT task in the same settings, thus simulating typical environments of a rotary-wing aircraft. Results show that speech intelligibility is significantly worse for the <b>contact</b> <b>microphones</b> than for the acoustic microphone, particularly in noisy environments, and some consonant types are affected more than others. Therefore, <b>contact</b> <b>microphones</b> are not recommended for use in any situation where fast and accurate speech intelligibility is essential...|$|R

No Wave artist Glenn Branca began building 3rd bridge zithers {{with an additional}} movable bridge positioned on the just intoned knotted positions of the harmonic series. Hans Reichel (Born 1949) is a German improvisational guitarist, luthier, and inventor. Reichel has constructed and built several variations of guitars and basses, most of them featuring multiple fretboards and unique positioning of pickups {{as well as the}} same indirect playing technique as Branca's instruments. The resulting sounds exceed the range of conventional tuning and add interesting effects, from odd overtones to metallic noises. Later he invented his Daxophone, where he's most famous for. His Daxophone consists of a single wooden blade fixed in a block containing a <b>contact</b> <b>microphone.</b> Normally, it is played by bowing the free end, {{but it can also be}} struck or plucked, which propagates sound in the same way a ruler halfway off a table does. These vibrations then continue to the wooden-block base, which in turn is amplified by the contact microphone(s) therein. A wide range of voice-like timbres can be produced, depending on the shape of the instrument, the type of wood, where it is bowed, and where along its length it is stopped with a separate block of wood (fretted on one side) called the [...] "dax." ...|$|E

A wide range of voice-like timbres can be produced, depending on {{the shape of the}} tongue and the type of wood. The tongue shape is made with a bandsaw or jigsaw. Denser woods such as ebony and oak produce a mellower sound than light woods. These sounds are notable for their comical, often human sounds.|$|R
