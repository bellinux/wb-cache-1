40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide methods to find the {{emission}} source and estimate the amount of waste gas emissions in the electricity <b>coal</b> supply <b>chain,</b> establish the model of the environmental impact (burden) in the electricity <b>coal</b> supply <b>chain,</b> detect the critical factor which causes significant environmental impact, and then identify the key control direction and reduce amount of environmental pollution in the electricity <b>coal</b> supply <b>chain.</b> Design/methodology/approach: In this context, life cycle inventory and life cycle assessment of China’s electricity coal were established in three difference stages: coal mining, coal transportation, and coal burning. Then the outcomes were analyzed with the aim to reduce waste gases emissions’ environmental impact in the electricity <b>coal</b> supply <b>chain</b> from the perspective of sensitivity analysis. Findings: The results and conclusion are as follow: (1) In terms of total waste gas emissions in electricity <b>coal</b> supply <b>chain,</b> CO 2 is emitted in the greatest quantity, accounting for 98 - 99 wt% of the total waste gas emissions. The vast majority of the CO 2, greater than 93 %, is emitted from the power plant when the coal is combusted. (2) Other than CO 2, the main waste gas is CH 4, SO 2 and so on. CH 4 is mainly emitted from Coal Bed Methane (CBM), so the option is to consider capturing some of the CH 4 from underground mines for an alternative use. SO 2 is mainly emitted from power plant when the coal is combusted. (3) The environmental burden of coal burning subsystem is greatest, followed by the coal mining subsystem, and finally the coal transportation subsystem. Improving the coal-burning efficiency of coal-fired power plant in electricity <b>coal</b> supply <b>chain</b> is the most effective way to reduce the environmental impact of waste gas emissions. (4) Of the three subsystems examined (coal mining, coal transportation, and coal burning), transportation requires the fewest resources and has the lowest waste gas emissions. However, the energy consumption for this subsystem is significant (excluding the mine mouth case), and transportation distance is found to have a substantial effect on the oil consumption and non-coal energy consumption. (5) In electricity <b>coal</b> supply <b>chain,</b> the biggest environmental impact of waste gas emissions is GWP, followed by EP, AP, POCP and ODP, and regional impact is greater than the global impact. Practical implications: The model and methodology established in this paper could be used for environmental impact assessment of waste gas emissions in electricity <b>coal</b> supply <b>chain</b> and sensitivity analysis in China, and it could supply reference and example for similar researches.

40|$|We {{consider}} the scheduling {{of the annual}} maintenance for the Hunter Valley <b>Coal</b> <b>Chain.</b> The <b>coal</b> <b>chain</b> is a system comprising load points, railway track and different types of terminal equipment, interacting in a complex way.

The main objective in the planning of these maintenance jobs is to maximize the total annual throughput. Based on a network flow model of the system we propose a mixed integer programming formulation for this planning task. In order to deal with the resulting large scale model which cannot be solved directly by a general purpose solver, we propose two steps. The number of binary variables is reduced by choosing a representative subset of the variables of the original problem, and a rolling horizon approach enables the approximation of the long term (i. e. annual) problem by a sequence of shorter problems (for instance monthly) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a resource}} constrained production planning and scheduling problem {{motivated by the}} <b>coal</b> supply <b>chain.</b> In this problem, multiple independent producers are connected with a resource availability (or, linking) constraint. A general description of such problems is provided, before decomposing the problem into two levels.

A real-world <b>coal</b> supply <b>chain</b> example is presented to anchor the approach. The overall problem can be formulated as an integrated mixed integer programming model which, in several cases, struggles to find even a feasible solution in reasonable amount of time. This paper discusses a distributed decision making approach based on column generation (CG). Computational experiments show that, the CG scheme has significant advantages over the integrated model and a Lagrangian relaxation scheme proposed by Thomas et al. (2013).

The design of experiment (DOE) approach has been employed. DOE is important as a formal way of maximizing information gained by available resources. It has more to offer than “one change at a time” experimental methods because it allows a judgment on the significance to the output of input variables acting alone, as well as input variables acting in combination with one another.

40|$|The Hunter Valley <b>Coal</b> <b>Chain</b> Coordinator (HVCCC) Limited is {{the primary}} {{planning}} organisation responsible for the export of coal through the Port of Newcastle, Australia. HVCCC stakeholders include producers (mining companies), rail track owners, above rail operators, and terminal operators. The HVCCC is tasked with coordinating the activities of all the corresponding parts of the coal export supply chain so as to maximise the system efficiency. The HVCCC also has a forward looking planning role: with demand for coal expected to double in the next decade, strategic capacity planning is a core activity for the HVCCC. Optimisation and simulation models are key aids in such activity. They are used to suggest and evaluate infrastructure expansions and operating policy changes. These models require input data {{in the form of}} shipping stems, which are arrival streams of ships at the port, together with their cargo types and composition, and date and time of arrival. Although everyone is familiar with the expression ‘garbage in equals garbage out’, relatively little research is dedicated to the issues surrounding input data generation. In this research we seek to redress this, and have developed a method for generating high quality shipping data. Shipping stems used as input should be realistic, reflecting key characteristics of historical patterns. They should accurately represent future demand scenarios. Yet they should also have controllable parameters {{that can be used to}} test what-if scenarios, such as are required by the HVCCC to answer questions about future infrastructure or operational plans. Here we review our process for achieving this, and give a case study analysing the effects of different shipping stems on the performance of the <b>coal</b> <b>chain,</b> as measured by a capacity assessment tool. The latter is an optimisation model that takes shipping stem and infrastructure data as input, and calculates key supply chain performance metrics.

40|$|The Hunter Valley <b>Coal</b> <b>Chain</b> (HVCC) {{consists}} of mining companies, rail operators, rail track owners and terminal operators, together forming the world’s largest coal exporting facility. In 2008, the throughput of HVCC was about 92 million tonnes, {{or more than}} ten per cent of the world’s total trade in coal for that year. The coal export operation generates around $ 15 billion in annual export income for Australia. As demand has increased significantly in recent years, {{and is expected to}} increase further in the future, efficient supply chain management is crucial. The Hunter Valley <b>Coal</b> <b>Chain</b> Coordinator Limited (HVCCC) was founded to enable integrated planning and coordination of the interests of all parties, thus improving the efficiency of the system as a whole. One of the many planning challenges faced by the HVCCC is that of annual maintenance planning. Different supply chain elements, such as trains, railway track, terminal equipment and load points, must undergo regular preventive and corrective maintenance, leading to significant reductions in system capacity (up to 15 per cent). However good alignment of the maintenance tasks can reduce their impact, and the HVCCC undertakes an annual process to ensure the impact of maintenance on the supply chain capacity is as small as possible. This is achieved in an iterative negotiation process between HVCCC and individual service providers. In the past, maintenance schedule optimisation was largely manual, which for the more than 1000 tasks involved is quite labour-intensive. In this paper the authors describe an approach developed at the University of Newcastle in partnership with the HVCCC to automate this schedule optimisation process. We will discuss our experience in applying exact (mixed integer programming) and heuristic techniques from mathematics and computer science to address the problem. This work is anticipated to lead to new decision-support tools for the HVCCC’s capacity planning team...|$|E

The objectives of the study are to analyse inefficiency associated with HVCC transportation infrastructure networks, discuss actions how to improve the situation and strategies proposed to improve the coal supply chain performance. The research findings suggest that the Newcastle port is increasingly becoming as the most critical gateway linking national coal supply chain to global markets particularly for China and India. the disruptions however caused by infrastructure bottlenecks are identifield to be detrimental to the supply chain performance.

40|$|In an ever-changing {{world where}} {{economic}} growth is inter-alia dependent on the export of bulk minerals, the risk and the severity of risk incidences in the bulk mineral supply chain should be minimised. In South Africa the export of coal is a large contributor to the GDP and any risk to this supply chain will directly affect its contribution to the GDP. Although all the stakeholders in the bulk <b>coal</b> export logistic <b>chain</b> manage the risk in their own domain, the bulk export logistic chain represents a supply chain structure where the risk of one stakeholder influences the risk of another stakeholder. Therefore, to reduce the total risk, an integrated risk management framework for the bulk <b>coal</b> export logistic <b>chain</b> is required. This study investigated the risks and the risk management processes in the bulk <b>coal</b> export supply <b>chain.</b> This logistic chain was chosen based on the monetary value the chain represents and the contribution to the GDP.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of PhilosophyA <b>coal</b> supply <b>chain</b> is {{a highly}} complex {{logistics}} system, comprising of several parties and components, focused on transporting coal from suppliers to end buyers. An important goal in many supply chains is to maximize the throughput. Due to the complex structure of a <b>coal</b> supply <b>chain,</b> a number of challenges arises when trying to maximize the throughput of the chain. One of the key challenges in a <b>coal</b> supply <b>chain</b> and one that plays a vital role when maximizing the throughput of the chain is the scheduling of preventive maintenance {{of the components of}} the chain that degrade over time, such as the rail network and the coal stacking machinery. During the maintenance period, the components are unavailable for work, which may result in a reduction in the throughput of the supply chain. In order to understand the complexities associated with the problem of scheduling preventative maintenance, we have analysed the complexity of an abstract version of the problem. We studied the problem of scheduling maintenance on arcs of a capacitated network so as to maximize the total flow from a source node to a sink node over a set of given time periods. Maintenance of an arc shuts down the arc {{for the duration of the}} period in which its maintenance is scheduled, reducing its capacity to zero for that period. A set of arcs is designated to have maintenance during the planning period, which will require each of the arcs to be shut down for exactly one time period. In general, this problem is known to be NP-hard. We have identified a number of characteristics that are relevant for the complexity of instance classes. In particular, we investigated instances with restrictions on the set of arcs for which maintenance is scheduled; series parallel networks; capacities that are balanced, in the sense that the total capacity of arcs entering a (non-terminal) node equals the total capacity of arcs leaving the node; and identical capacities on all arcs. Another factor that has a great impact on the throughput of the <b>coal</b> supply <b>chain</b> is the management of the stockyard, which is the interface between the land portion of the <b>coal</b> supply <b>chain</b> and the ocean portion of the <b>coal</b> supply <b>chain,</b> and where the cargoes get assembled. Given a number of vessels arriving at the port, stockyard management decisions include: assigning a location to each cargo (stockpile) of a vessel in the stockyard, scheduling the assembly of the cargoes, scheduling the stacking and reclaiming of the cargoes, etc. The resulting decision problem is challenging, but plays a crucial role in the overall performance of the logistics chain. In this thesis, we have focused on the placement of the stockpiles on the stock pads and the scheduling of the reclaiming of the stockpiles. We study a number of variants of an abstract scheduling problem inspired by the scheduling of the reclaimers in the stockyard of a coal export terminal. We have analysed the complexity of each of the variants, providing complexity proofs for some and polynomial algorithms for others. For some of the variants, we present mixed integer programming formulations, exact algorithms, such as branch and bound algorithms and dynamic programming algorithms, and constant factor approximation algorithms. Furthermore, we perform extensive computational studies to analyse the performance of the proposed solution methodologies...|$|R

Due to severe constraints on {{the capacity of the}} infrastructure involved, highly competitive adversarial and destructive relationships have evolved between the supply chain players. As a result, the supply chain is characterised by high inventory levels, delays and queues which perhaps could be lessened if the players would work together instead of competing for capacity so intensely through destructive political and economic relationships.
