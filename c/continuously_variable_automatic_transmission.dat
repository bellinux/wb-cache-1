The two different engine sizes gave Japanese drivers a choice as to which annual road tax obligation {{they were willing to}} pay; vehicles with the larger engine were equipped at a higher level than the lower trim level in compensation.|$|R
50|$|When Mitsubishi {{introduced}} a new independent generation of Lancer in 2000 (without a corresponding Mirage), the old Mirage-based sedan was discontinued in Japan, although production continued for export. The next phase in the Mirage's demise was {{the release of the}} Colt—a five-door hatchback—in 2002. The Colt replaced the Mirage hatchback, despite the latter being a three-door. Unlike its predecessor, the Colt featured a tall, upright design with a short engine compartment to maximize interior dimensions. Engines for the Colt comprised 1.1-liter three-cylinder, plus 1.3-, 1.5-, and 1.6-liter gasoline inline-fours with a standard five-speed manual and optional <b>continuously</b> <b>variable</b> <b>transmission</b> (<b>automatic).</b>|$|R

5000|$|Two {{forms of}} a <b>continuously</b> <b>variable</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> (CVT) were {{available}} on the Airwave. The [...] "G" [...] trim line had a standard CVT, while the [...] "L" [...] sported a CVT with seven-speed mode which allowed the driver {{to choose between the}} smooth, shiftless acceleration of a standard CVT, or the added option of shifting through seven computer-controlled [...] "gears".|$|E
50|$|From 1957 to 1961, Chevrolet also {{produced}} the Turboglide, a triple turbine <b>continuously</b> <b>variable</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> with concurrent ratios whose design {{was similar to}} that of Buick's Flight Pitch Dynaflow, subsequently called Triple Turbine (full technical description). The Turboglide, only offered with V8 engines, was more expensive (by about $50) than the Powerglide and did not have wide acceptance, in part due to failures in 1957-58 models, which were addressed by a significantly upgraded version for 1959.|$|E
50|$|In April 1953, Simplex added a <b>variable</b> speed <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> with {{centrifugal}} shoe-type clutch and belt-type <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission.</b> The {{ratio was}} changed by {{expanding and contracting}} the drive pulley, with a low ratio of approximately 18:1 and a high ratio of approximately 7:1. The transmission was belt-driven and drove the real wheel by belt, with automatic belt tensioning by jockey pulley.|$|R
50|$|The Majesty's engine {{features}} suction-piston-type fuel injection with a step-motor controlled, automatic {{idle speed control}} and throttle position sensor, an automatic decompression system and a dual-chamber airbox, air-injection system and catalyst. The fuel tank holds 3.7-gallons. The transmission is a double-cog V-belt constantly <b>variable</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission.</b> The bike's controlled-fill (cast) aluminum alloy main frame has a steel tube subframe and 41 mm fork tubes and rear suspension with two long-travel coil-over shock absorbers. The cast wheels have 14-inch front and 13-inch rear tires. Braking is via 267 mm hydraulic front and rear disc brakes with a left handlebar-mounted parking brake lever. The bike's riding posture is between Standard and Cruiser. Bodywork features include an integrated passenger grab rail, locking underseat storage with 16 gallon capacity, two glove boxess (one lockable in the inner front apron), and LED taillight. Instrumentation includes analog speedometer and tachometer, LCD multifunction display with fuel gauge, coolant temp gauge, ambient temp gauge, V-belt and oil indicators.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1928 a {{sensation}} at the 22nd Paris Motor Show was the Bucciali TAV-6. [...] Six {{years before the}} appearance of the Citroën Traction and more than two years before the launch of the DKW F1, the Bucciali TAV-6 featured front-wheel drive. [...] Another innovative concept which would only become familiar to most auto-industry observers several decades later was provided by the Sensaud de Lavaud infinitely <b>variable</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission.</b> [...] The car was exhibited on the Bucciali show stand in bare chassis form, enabling visitors to study the fwd drive-train with its enormous transversely mounted transmission, as well as the all-round independent suspension. [...] Almost as eye catching in their own terms were the wheels which were elaborately sculpted from Alpax castings. [...] The car at the show sat on a 3470 mm wheelbase and was powered by a Continental side-valve 2.4 litre engine. [...] Later versions of the car would be offered with 6 or 8 cylinder engines.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] Honda SH50 is a , air-cooled, two stroke, single cylinder, scooter style, {{restricted}} moped {{manufactured by}} the Honda Motor Company between 1984 and 2006, with substantial revisions for the 1996 model year. It {{was equipped with}} <b>continuously</b> <b>variable</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission,</b> (Honda V-Matic transmission) together with both electric and kick start, automatic choke and capacitor discharge electronic ignition. Brakes were drum front and rear, (disc front on later models) operated pedal-cycle style by two handlebar levers. The early models had some resemblance to Honda's C50/70/90 Super Cub range with a similar shape, dual seat and rear carrier, but with a scooter type floor, unlike the P series of mopeds such as the Honda PC50 or the Honda Express N series, which had cycle style construction. The SH50 was {{also known as the}} City Express and in some markets, as the Scoopy. All models had cycle type wheels as against the smaller wheels of later 50cc scooter style mopeds. The battery, fuel tank and two-stroke-oil reservoir were contained under the seat. Electrics were 12 volt and a handlebar mounted binnacle, which effectively formed part of the front bodywork, contained basic instrumentation and warning lights.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Automatic</b> <b>Variable</b> <b>Transmission</b> (AVT) is {{composed}} of a metal belt CVT unit and a step speed changing transmission component. According {{to the needs of}} automotive conditions, AVT can realize <b>continuously</b> <b>variable</b> transmission and gear transmission, which not only play the advantage of gear transmission efficiency, but also overcome the deficiency of CVT when it is in high-speed. In the paper, the transmission matching rule is introduced, and engine model is established using engine test data. Based on SimulationX software, a vehicle that equips AVT is used for modeling and simulation. Finally the power matching is researched...|$|R

50|$|The {{desire for}} driver {{convenience}} {{led to the}} widespread implementation of the semi-automatic <b>transmission,</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> and <b>continuously</b> <b>variable</b> <b>transmission</b> (CVT). Some <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> vehicles have extra controls that modify the choices made by the transmission system. These controls depend on the engine and road speed. <b>Automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> generally have a straight pattern, beginning at the most forward position with park, and running through reverse, neutral, drive, {{and then to the}} lower gears.|$|R
50|$|A {{conventional}} 5-speed {{manual transmission}} {{is often the}} standard equipment in a base-model car, while more expensive manual vehicles are usually equipped with a 6-speed transmission instead; other options include <b>automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> such as a traditional <b>automatic</b> (hydraulic planetary) <b>transmission</b> (often a manumatic), a semi-automatic transmission, or a <b>continuously</b> <b>variable</b> transmission (CVT). The number of forward gear ratios is often expressed for <b>automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> as well (e.g., 9-speed automatic).|$|R
50|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> {{are less}} common on {{motorcycles}} than manual, and are mostly found only on scooters and some custom cruisers and exotic sports bikes. Types include <b>continuously</b> <b>variable</b> transmission, semi-automatic transmission and dual clutch transmission.|$|R
50|$|Most modern {{motorcycles}} have a sequential {{manual transmission}} shifted by a foot lever. Some motorcycles, and many scooters, use a <b>continuously</b> <b>variable</b> transmission.

30|$|Gilmore {{emphasized}} that efficiency goals could represent {{one of the}} key factors governing drivetrain choice. With specifying three developments, the conventional four-speed manual or <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> was competed, and the fuel consumption associated with <b>continuously</b> <b>variable</b> ratio and infinitely variable ratio automobile transmissions were simulated in the situations of urban and highway constant-speed operation [15].|$|R
50|$|The third {{generation}} {{was launched in}} late 2008, to keep the range competitive. In October 2008, both the five-door hatchback and Mégane Coupé were officially put on sale. The two models have different designs; the Coupé has a sporty design while the five-door model is more conservative. No <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> is offered, with it being replaced by a <b>continuously</b> <b>variable</b> transmission.|$|R
5000|$|Four-cylinder VUE's use the Ecotec I4. The L81 V6 {{from the}} L-Series and {{five-speed}} Aisin AF33 <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> were initially offered, but starting in 2004, all six-cylinder Vues were equipped with Honda's [...] J35A3 engine and a Honda transmission.

50|$|Y10 Fire LX i.e. (and Selectronic version): The new Y10 Fire LX i.e. was {{recognized}} externally by the lower bumper {{painted in the}} body color, the adhesive strip, with the mark of identification, which runs through the lower edge of the side and the chrome tailpipe. Internally there were cloth seats or, on request, upholstery in Alcantara. The dashboard and door panels are upholstered in Alcantara as a standard.In December 1989, Autobianchi, debuted the Y10 Selectronic <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> version with ECVT: Electronic <b>Continuously</b> <b>Variable</b> Transmission.

The CVT transmission was produced by Japanese Fuji and was the same as that used in the Subaru Justy.|$|R
50|$|Japanese sales {{began on}} 8 May 1996. At that time, most rival Japanese {{vehicles}} usually had the engine mounted under the driver's seat, or a cabover type. The Stepwgn used the latter, and {{was based on}} the Civic, to keep prices low - starting from ¥1,548,000 and going up to ¥2,368,000. The passenger side was fitted with a sliding door, to allow easier access. To improve profitability, cost reduction measures were used, such as there being only one engine and transmission option (a 2-litre in-line 4 and a -cvt=countinously <b>variable</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>automatic),</b> and the vehicle design reduced the use of steel panels and parts.|$|R
50|$|A <b>continuously</b> <b>variable</b> {{transmission}} (CVT) (also {{known as}} a single-speed transmission, stepless transmission, pulley transmission, or, in case of motorcycles, a twist-and-go) is an <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> that can change seamlessly through a continuous range of effective gear ratios. This contrasts with other mechanical transmissions that offer a fixed number of gear ratios. The flexibility of a CVT allows the input shaft to maintain a constant angular velocity.|$|R
50|$|Torsen T-2 based quattro {{permanent}} {{four-wheel drive}} remained as an option on most A4 models. Audi retired its 5-speed manual transmissions in favour of a new Getrag 6-speed. As before, multitronic <b>continuously</b> <b>variable</b> transmission (CVT), now with selectable seven-speeds, was an option on front-wheel drive models, whilst a conventional ZF 6HP 6-speed tiptronic <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> was an option on the quattro four-wheel drive models.|$|R
5000|$|By 1993, Formula One {{had become}} {{very much a}} {{high-tech}} arena and the FW15C was at the very forefront, featuring active suspension, anti-lock brakes, traction control, telemetry, fly-by-wire controls, pneumatic valve springs, power steering, semi-automatic <b>transmission,</b> a fully <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> and also <b>continuously</b> <b>variable</b> transmission, although the latter was only used in testing. As a result, Alain Prost described the car as [...] "a little Airbus".|$|R
5000|$|The Brio {{is powered}} by either a four-cylinder, 1.2 L L12B i-VTEC {{gasoline}} engine delivering [...] or 1.3 L L13A i-VTEC delivering [...] for the Indonesian market until 2016. It is available with either a 5-speed manual, 5-speed <b>automatic</b> or a <b>continuously</b> <b>variable</b> <b>transmission.</b> The car is certified to deliver a combined mileage of [...] and [...] with manual and <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> respectively on the Indian cycle.|$|R
50|$|The manual {{transmission}} couples {{the engine to}} the transmission with a rigid clutch instead of the torque converter on an <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> or the v-belt of a <b>continuously</b> <b>variable</b> transmission, which slip by nature. Manual transmissions also lack the parasitic power consumption of the automatic transmission's hydraulic pump. Because of this, {{manual transmission}}s generally offer better fuel economy than <b>automatic</b> or <b>continuously</b> <b>variable</b> transmissions; however the disparity has been somewhat offset {{with the introduction of}} locking torque converters on <b>automatic</b> <b>transmissions.</b> Increased fuel economy with a properly operated manual transmission vehicle versus an equivalent <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> vehicle can range from 5% to about 15% depending on driving conditions and style of driving. The lack of control over downshifting under load in an <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission,</b> coupled with a typical vehicle engine's greater efficiency under higher load, can enable additional fuel gains from a manual transmission by allowing the operator to keep the engine performing under a more efficient load/RPM combination. This is especially true as between manual and automatic versions of older models, as more recent advances including variable valve timing reduce the efficiency disadvantages of <b>automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> by allowing better performance over a broader RPM range. In recognition of this, many current models (2010 and on) come with manual modes, or overrides on automatic models, although the degree of control varies greatly by the manufacturer. Also, manual transmissions do not require active cooling and because they are, mechanically, much simpler than <b>automatic</b> <b>transmissions,</b> they generally weigh less than comparable automatics, which can improve economy in stop-and-go traffic. However this gap in economy is being rapidly closed, and many mid to higher end model automatic cars now get better economy than their standard spec counterparts. This is in part due to the increasing impact of computers co-ordinating multiple systems, particularly in hybrid models in which the engine and drive motors must be managed, as well as using different automatic technology such as CVT and Dual-Clutch Automatics.|$|R
5000|$|Transmission choices {{include a}} {{simulated}} six-speed sequential shift <b>automatic</b> (<b>Continuously</b> <b>Variable</b> <b>Transmission)</b> for Hybrid models, or an eight-speed automatic for I4 and V6 powered Camrys.|$|R
