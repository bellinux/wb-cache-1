However based on our analysis for the typical implementation procedure of the automated <b>visual</b> <b>inspection</b> technologies using robots, the period to implement the inspection processes are usually very long. The reasons are {{that there are many}} adjustment activities in the real plant concurrently concerning the imaging conditions, the robot motion conditions, and the <b>visual</b> <b>inspection</b> conditions. In order to reduce the period to implement the automated <b>visual</b> <b>inspection</b> processes, {{it is very important to}} reduce the adjustment activates in the real plant. Therefore it is necessary to develop the simulation technologies to support the adjustment activates on the virtual beforehand. We focus on the manufacturing cell simulation environment for the automated <b>visual</b> <b>inspection</b> using robots. The manufacturing cell simulation environment which provides to support the above adjustments on the virtual even if the robot and the target product are not existed, is proposed and developed. In this paper, the manufacturing cell simulation environment to solve the problems is proposed. Seven requirements for the simulation environment are defined. The fundamental system with five functions to implement the simulation environment is proposed and implemented.

40|$|<b>Visual</b> <b>inspection</b> is {{the primary}} {{technique}} used in most routine inspections; therefore, it is of interest to update the safety and reliability assessment of reinforced concrete (RC) structures in corrosive environments using <b>visual</b> <b>inspection</b> of corrosion damage to the concrete cover. A spatial time-dependent structural reliability analysis is developed to update the deterioration process and evaluate the probabilities of corrosion-induced cover cracking (corrosion damage) and structural failure based on <b>visual</b> <b>inspection</b> information of corrosion damage. The performance of RC beams is used to illustrate the reliability analysis developed in this paper. The <b>visual</b> <b>inspection</b> finding considered herein is the timing, extent, and location of corrosion-induced surface cracking, {{which is used to}} provide an updated estimate of structural reliability. It was found that <b>visual</b> <b>inspection</b> finding significantly changes the future reliability predictions, and observations of corrosion damage at critical locations considerably increases failure probability.

Thus, estimating the depth of such surface-opening crack is vital. This study presents impact-echo (IE) and non-contact video-based methods to estimate the surface-opening crack of concrete beams in the laboratory, and the results are compared with <b>visual</b> <b>inspection.</b> Results show that the IE method estimates a considerably larger crack depth than the non-contact video-based method and <b>visual</b> <b>inspection.</b> Although the difference between the depth measured by non-contact video-based method and <b>visual</b> <b>inspection</b> is small, the depth estimated by non-contact video-based method is slightly larger than that measured by <b>visual</b> <b>inspection</b> because it can identify the unrecognizable micro-crack by <b>visual</b> <b>inspection.</b> Moreover, when adopting the IE method, the depth of inclined crack is more overestimated than the vertical crack.|$|R

40|$|On-site <b>visual</b> <b>inspection</b> {{will play}} an {{essential}} role in future Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) verification. Although seismic and remote sensing techniques are the best understood and most developed methods for detection of evasive testing of nuclear weapons, <b>visual</b> <b>inspection</b> can greatly augment the certainty and detail of understanding provided by these more traditional methods. Not only can <b>visual</b> <b>inspection</b> offer ``ground truth`` in cases of suspected nuclear testing, but it also can provide accurate source location and testing media properties necessary for detailed analysis of seismic records. For testing in violation of the CTBT, an offending party may attempt to conceal the test, which most likely will be achieved by underground burial. While such concealment may not prevent seismic detection, evidence of test deployment, location, and yield can be disguised. In this light, if a suspicious event is detected by seismic or other remote methods, <b>visual</b> <b>inspection</b> of the event area is necessary to document any evidence that might support a claim of nuclear testing and provide data needed to further interpret seismic records and guide further investigations. However, the methods for <b>visual</b> <b>inspection</b> are not widely known nor appreciated, and experience is presently limited. <b>Visual</b> <b>inspection</b> can be achieved by simple, non-intrusive means, primarily geological in nature, and it is the purpose of this report to describe the considerations, procedures, and equipment required to field such an inspection...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION In {{industrial}} manufacturing, product inspection is {{an important}} step in the production process. Since product reliability and quality management is of utmost importance in most mass-production facilities, 100 percent inspection of all parts, subassemblies, and finished products is often attempted. As a result, the inspection process is often the most costly stage in manufacturing. A central task for machine-based inspection is inspecting for <b>visual</b> appearance. <b>Visual</b> <b>inspection</b> seeks to identify both functional and cosmetic defects. At present, <b>visual</b> <b>inspection</b> in many manufacturing processes is carried out by human inspectors whose performance is generally inadequate and variable. The human visual system is adapted to perform in a world of variety and change; the <b>visual</b> <b>inspection</b> process, on the other hand, requires observing the same type of image repeatedly to detect anomalies. Moreover, the accuracy of human <b>visual</b> <b>inspection</b> declines with dull, endlessly ro...|$|R
