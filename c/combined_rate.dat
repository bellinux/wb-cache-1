[...] The armament was eight [...]50 caliber (12.7mm) [...] "light-barrel" [...] Browning AN/M2 machine guns, four in each wing.

2500|$|Clustering all the {{armament}} in {{the nose}} was unusual in U.S. aircraft, which typically used wing-mounted guns with trajectories set up to crisscross at one or more points in a convergence zone. Nose-mounted guns did not suffer from having their useful ranges limited by pattern convergence, meaning that good pilots could shoot much farther. A Lightning could reliably hit targets at any range up to , whereas the wing guns of other fighters were optimized for a specific range. The rate of fire was about 650 rounds per minute for the 20×110 mm cannon round (130-gram shell) at a muzzle velocity of about , and for the [...]50-caliber machine guns (51-gram rounds), about 850rpm at [...] velocity. <b>Combined</b> <b>rate</b> of fire was over 4,000rpm with roughly every sixth projectile a 20mm shell.

2500|$|The dual 2 [...] 30mm cannons (as well as {{the later}} 2A38M) were {{designed}} by the KBP Instrument Design Bureau and manufactured by the Tulamashzavod Joint Stock Company. The cannons are fired alternatively with a <b>combined</b> <b>rate</b> of fire of between 3,900 and 5,000 rounds per minute (1,950 to 2,500 rpm for each gun), and have a muzzle velocity of 960m/s. Bursts of between 83 and 250 rounds are fired {{as determined by the}} target type, with an engagement range between 0.2 and 4.0km and to an altitude of about 3km. HE-T and HE-I shells are used and fitted with a A-670 time and impact fuze which includes an arming delay and self destruct mechanism. Sources vary on elevation capabilities (one estimate gives +85 to −9 degrees, while another +87 to −10 degrees), though this range allows the system to engage ground as well as aerial targets. The 2K22 can fire its cannons in two primary modes of operation, radar and optical. In radar mode, the target tracking is fully automatic, with the guns aimed using data from the radar. In optical mode, the gunner tracks the target through the 1A29 stabilized sight, with the radar providing range data. The 2K22 is reported to have a kill probability of 0.8 with cannon. The height of defeat for guns is 0–2000 meters—for missiles 10–3500 meters.|$|E

To accurately accommodate fast time-varying channel conditions, we propose to embed the selected rate information into the acknowledgement (ACK) frames.
