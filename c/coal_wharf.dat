25|$|Ivy City began a {{significant}} decline in 1953. American railroads, which until this time had used coal-fueled locomotives, began switching to diesel fuel or using overhead electrical wires for powering engines. By {{the end of}} the year, almost no coal-fed locomotives were using the Ivy City rail yard. Although coal-fueled engines required frequent refueling, a diesel train could go for as many as three days without needing more diesel fuel. Steam-powered locomotives required almost daily tune-up and repair, but diesel-fueled engines rarely did. Significant layoffs at the Ivy City Yard occurred, deeply affecting Ivy City itself were many of these workers lived. The eastern roundhouse and a number of tracks were demolished in early 1954, and by 1956 the <b>coal</b> <b>wharf</b> and ash pits were also gone. As the railroad laid off workers, Ivy City also declined as a neighborhood.|$|E
500|$|Local silk weaving {{became a}} large part of {{everyday}} life. The work took place in domestic cottages in a room known as a [...] "loomshop", and the woven silk was transported to firms in Macclesfield [...] away. Silk-weaving remained commonplace in the area until the early 20th century, when the process became industrialised. Other industries in the area included a corn mill, which collapsed some time during the First World War, located next to the Micker Brook; cotton weaving; and brickworks, one located where the fire station is and one near the railway station. A <b>coal</b> <b>wharf</b> was situated opposite the railway station and supplied the area with coal.|$|E
500|$|The new battery was {{constructed}} during 1799 on marshy ground {{a short distance}} south-east of St Catherine's Church. It took {{its name from the}} nearby Coalhouse Point, which was named for a <b>coal</b> <b>wharf</b> that once existed there to serve East Tilbury. The soft soil caused many problems but the work was completed by July of that year. It was equipped with four 24-pounder (pdr.) cannon mounted on traversing carriages, which enabled the gunners to track targets much more easily than had been the case with traditional garrison carriages. The battery faced the river with a semi-circular earthen rampart on which the guns were mounted. A walled-off area to the rear enclosed a barracks, magazine and shot kiln (for heating shot to set wooden ships on fire). The whole structure was surrounded by a polygonal water-filled ditch. It was modified in 1810 to raise the height of the rampart and to add a small expense magazine where ammunition was stored for immediate use. The French did not test the Thames defences, despite an invasion scare in 1804, and the battery was abandoned along with those at Lower Hope Point and Shornemead following Napoleon's final defeat in 1815.|$|E

It then continued via a bridge under Worcester Street to end in a <b>coal</b> <b>wharf</b> beside New Road. In 1951 the basin and wharves were filled in and Nuffield College now stands on part of the site.|$|E

50|$|The area {{north of}} the High Street {{gradually}} turned into a Victorian slum. The most notorious part was the so-called Dusthole, between Beresford Street, Warren Lane and the river, named after the dust from neighbouring <b>coal</b> <b>wharves.</b> Many people that lived in this area were of Irish descent. Poverty and prostitution were prevalent here. The depravity of the area attracted numerous religious institutions and led in 1850 {{to the establishment of}} the Woolwich Baths and Lecture Hall on Nelson Street, one of London's earliest public baths. Later in the 19th century, more and more houses were replaced by industrial developments (<b>coal</b> <b>wharves,</b> a gas company and a power station).|$|R

6000|$|... 64. It is {{unfortunately}} a prevailing {{idea with}} some of our architects, that what is a disagreeable object in itself may be relieved or concealed by lavish ornament; and there never was a greater mistake. It should be a general principle, that what is intrinsically ugly should be utterly destitute of ornament, that the eye may not be drawn to it. The pretended skulls of the three Magi at Cologne are set in gold, and have a diamond in each eye; and are a thousand times more ghastly than if their brown bones had been left in peace. Such an error as this ought never to be committed in architecture. If any part of the building has disagreeable associations connected with it, let it alone: do not ornament it. Keep it subdued, and simply adapted to its use; and the eye will not go to it, nor quarrel with it. It would have been well if this principle had been kept in view in the renewal of some of the public buildings in Oxford. In All Souls College, for instance, the architect has carried his chimneys half as high as {{all the rest of the}} building, and fretted them with Gothic. The eye is instantly caught by the plated candlestick-like columns, and runs with some complacency up the groining and fret-work, and alights finally and fatally on a red chimney-top. He might as well have built a Gothic aisle at an entrance to a <b>coal</b> <b>wharf.</b> We have no scruple in saying that the man who could desecrate the Gothic trefoil into an ornament for a chimney has not the slightest feeling, and never will have any, of its beauty or its use; he was never born to be an architect, and never will be one.|$|E
