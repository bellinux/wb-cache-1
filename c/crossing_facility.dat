Aiming at examining the pedestrian perceptions toward <b>crossing</b> <b>facilities</b> and preferences for crossing locations, an observational study of pedestrian crossing behaviour at urban street is conducted.

A multinomial logit model is proposed to describe the perceptions and preferences of pedestrians on <b>crossing</b> <b>facilities</b> and locations. The sensitivity analysis is performed to discuss the influence of various factors on crossing behaviour.

50|$|Currently, {{the route}} is very sparsely used between Bucharest and Călărași, mainly by commuters between Bucharest and its suburbs of Pantelimon and Brănești, {{as well as}} by villagers along its route, as a feeder to A2.

However, as southwestern Dobrudja is sparsely populated, with no notable towns or cities (Ostrov being the biggest, at slightly over 5000 inhabitants), that stretch of the road is sparsely used as well.DN3 connects with the Bulgarian road network through a border <b>crossing</b> <b>facility</b> at Ostrov - Silistra (Bulgaria), immediately after the ferry landing. Thus, if counting the Călărași-Ostrov ferry as part of the DN3 road, it can be said that one of the main remaining roles of DN3 is providing a connection between Călărași and Silistra. Note that as of 2009, there is also a direct, newly built Călărași - Silistra ferry, but is far slower (takes almost 2 hours to cross the 8 km distance) and far more infrequent.|$|E

This analisys method of critical gap is used for searching the minimum gap among vehicle passing through location in order that the pedestrian crossing the street may cross safety. Primary data taking is carried out throung field survey using handycam for watching the conflict point and time gap between vehicles passing throung the street and pefestrian who cross the street to the conflict point. From the data analisys result, the writer obtains that critical gap in study location is 2, 62 second and the opportunity degree for crossing the street safety is only 11 persons on 6. 30 to 7. 30 WIB and 7. 30 to 8. 30 as much as 29 persons. Thus, we may conclude that pedestrian <b>crossing</b> <b>facility,</b> namely zebra cross is not effective and for the further is that pedestrian crossing should not be in the same field.

40|$|Pedestrians are {{legitimate}} {{users of the}} transportation system and they should, therefore, {{be able to use}} this system safely and without unreasonable delay. Pedestrians have a right to cross roads safely, Planers and Engineers, therefore, have a professional responsibility to plan, design, and provide safe crossing facilities. Major findings of recent accident studies have identified that pedestrians comprise a significant proportion or serious injuries and fatalities. Furthermore it has found that one half of pedestrian fatalities have occurred while the pedestrian was crossing the road but not on a marked pedestrian crossing. As the majority of pedestrian accidents occur while crossing a road, the need of safe and efficient pedestrian crossing facilities could arguably be the most important pedestrian safety factor. Generally, the cost of installation and maintenance of pedestrian crossing needs to be balanced against associated benefits such as time saving and safety. Therefore, installation of pedestrian crossing at a location of a road is being considered, delay {{is one of the major}} term that should be considered and it will be significantly differ upon the type of crossing introduced to a particular location. Some time there would be additional delay by introducing crossing where it is not needed or inappropriate In Sri Lanka, the practice of deciding where to install pedestrian crossing considerably differs from other countries, and engineers have been got to use their judgment arbitrarily and sometimes influenced by political or pubic pressure in reaching decisions, Goal of this study is, to prepare a background to develop set of guidelines to assist in determining the appropriate <b>crossing</b> <b>facility</b> for a given location of a road, based on the relationship between pedestrian and vehicle flow and their delays. These relationships help to develop a more efficient pedestrian <b>crossing</b> <b>facility</b> that minimizes total delay for both pedestrians and vehicles...|$|E
40|$|In the UK, the Puffin {{crossing}} has {{provision to}} extend pedestrian green time {{for those who}} take longer to cross. However, even at such a pedestrian friendly facility, the traffic signal control is usually designed to minimise vehicle delay while providing the <b>crossing</b> <b>facility.</b> This situation is rather contrary to the current policies to encourage walking. It is this inequity that has prompted the need to re-examine the traffic control of signalised crossings to provide more benefit to both pedestrians and vehicles. In this context, this paper explores the possibility of implementing an Upstream Detection strategy at a Puffin crossing to provide a user friendly crossing. The study {{has been carried out}} by simulating a mid-block Puffin crossing for various detector distances and a number of combinations of pedestrian and traffic flows.  This paper presents the simulation results and recommends the situations at which Upstream Detection would be suitable. </p...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} an evaluation of pilot project pedestrian detection systems installed in three different European cities at in total six different sites. The implemented systems had the improvement of safety and comfort of pedestrians as objectives. The systems provided early detection of pedestrians approaching the <b>crossing</b> <b>facility</b> and detection of the presence of pedestrian on the <b>crossing</b> <b>facility,</b> allowing the onset of a pedestrian green phase or an extension of such a green phase. The evaluation involved the registration of pedestrian behaviour and pedestrian-vehicle encounters and conflicts. Pedestrian behaviour was recorded on videotape, conflicts were scored on the spot by trained observers. The behaviour recorded on videotape was later analysed using approach speed, nonnative behaviour and appropriate use of the crossing facilities as main indicators. In addition, pedestrian signal settings were recorded for each crossing. The evaluation design used a beforelafter measurement design with the after measurements being taken at least two weeks after the system implementation. The results indicated that although red light violations were reduced at some sites, they remained at a high level. The implementations had some positive effects on the normative behaviour of pedestrians. The percentage of pedestrians getting involved in encounters with motorized traffic was reduced at one site, increased at another and remained unchanged at the other sites. A significant reduction in conflicts was observed at several sites, but at other sites conflict occurrence remained unchanged. The system implementations had a very distinct positive effect on pedestrian delay. Required waiting times were reduced at all but one site and at some sites the reductions were substantial. Pedestrian comfort was also improved by an increase in the percentage of pedestrians arriving durhg the pedestrian green phase and the percentage being able to complete their crossing during pedestrian green. In summary, the evaluation study demonstrated that some safety effects and substantial effect on comfort were achieved by the implementation of the systems. The effects can be further optimized by selecting sites that fulfil specific requirements for successful implementation. Red light violation by pedestrian remains a serious safety problem and further studies should be undertaken how further reductions can be achieved by optimizing signal settings...|$|E
