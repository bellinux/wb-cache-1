50|$|The {{range of}} {{services}} has also expanded with some outlets that offer fresh meat and fish <b>counters.</b> <b>Frozen</b> food sections, excluded from the original stores due {{to the cost of}} refrigeration, are now standard. Other features remain unchanged, though, with No Frills customers still required to pack their own groceries and bring their own shopping bags or pay 5 cents per bag.|$|R

3000|$|The first {{equation}} in (2) {{indicates that}} {{at the beginning of}} each slot time, the backoff counter is decremented if the channel is sensed idle. The second equation shows that the backoff <b>counter</b> is <b>frozen</b> if channel is sensed busy.

30|$|A {{delicate}} {{difference between}} DCF and EDCA is regarding {{the exact time}} that <b>frozen</b> <b>counters</b> start to decrease. In DCF, decrement occurs {{at the edge of}} first slot coming immediately after DIFS idle time, whereas in EDCA the counter reduction is accomplished at the first edge of last AIFS idle slot. Although this little difference may not lead to a tangible influence on performance, it makes the analysis more convenient in EDCA case.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of freezing and the duration of freezing on somatic cell count (SCC) in milk samples from quarters with no signs of clinical mastitis. Effect was determined by a fluoro-opto-electronic cell <b>counter.</b> Samples were <b>frozen</b> in a commercial freezer at approximately - 20 degrees C. The milk samples were thawed at 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14, or 28 d. Another batch of samples was frozen 1 d, thawed, frozen again for 1 d, and then thawed. The SCC was determined on the fresh samples and after any one of the freezing periods. On average, the SCC were lower after all freezing periods than they were before freezing. However, the difference in SCC before and after freezing was small and relatively constant on the natural logarithm scale. The decrease in SCC was larger with longer freezing periods. When SCC thresholds of 200, 000, 250, 000, and 500, 000 cells/ml were used to predict infection, freezing appeared to have little impact on the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic parameters. Therefore, SCC, as determined by a fluoro-opto-electronic cell <b>counter,</b> determined for <b>frozen</b> quarter milk samples can be used in mastitis control and research programs.

40|$|Tilapia {{production}} surged {{around the}} world during the 1990 ’s and early 2000 ’s. Tilapias are now the second most popular farmed fishes after the carps, with global production well over 1, 526, 000 mt in 2003. This has been accomplished by developing large consumer markets in North America and Europe, which are purchasing fish grown in tropical countries with year-round production and relatively low costs. These markets have evolved in a similar manner, starting with immigrant communities, moving into high cost, white tablecloth restaurants, then casual dining chains, hypermarkets and club stores and finally to traditional seafood <b>counters</b> and <b>frozen</b> foods of local groceries. With this rapid development in markets have come {{a variety of new}} product forms and commercial by-products. This has been a critical factor in the continued rise of tilapia in the ranks of popular seafoods and is a result of thoughtful marketing and product development, as well as increasing demands from retailers and consumers. A variety of product forms are described along with methodologies used to develop new markets for these products. By-products including leather goods, pharmaceutical products, and decorative objects made from tilapia scales are also described...|$|R
30|$|Regardless {{of whether}} the MU-Basic scheme or the MU-RTS/CTS scheme is used, nodes will start a random {{back-off}} counter to compete for accessing the channel if it has been idle for AIFS. Then, each node decreases its random back-off counter by one if the channel is detected as free; otherwise, it freezes the counter. In the latter case, the <b>frozen</b> <b>counter</b> will be reused in the next channel access contention. That is to say, in between each decrement of the back-off counter, a node could observe the channel in either an empty state (no transmission activities) or a busy state (a successful transmission or collisions). Therefore, a slot time could be a constant value σ if the channel is empty, Ts {{if there is a}} successful transmission, or Tc if there are collisions.|$|R
5|$|On 6 September 2012, the ECB {{announced}} to offer additional financial {{support in the}} form of some yield-lowering bond purchases (OMT), for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailout program from EFSF/ESM. A eurozone country can benefit from the program if -and for as long as- it is found to suffer from stressed bond yields at excessive levels; but only at the point of time where the country possesses/regains a complete market access -and only if the country still complies with all terms in the signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) agreement. Countries receiving a precautionary programme rather than a sovereign bailout will, by definition, have complete market access and thus qualify for OMT support if also suffering from stressed interest rates on its government bonds. In regards of countries receiving a sovereign bailout (Ireland, Portugal and Greece), they will on the other hand not qualify for OMT support before they have regained complete market access, which will normally only happen after having received the last scheduled bailout disbursement. Despite none OMT programmes were ready to start in September/October, the financial markets straight away took notice of the additionally planned OMT packages from ECB, and started slowly to price-in a decline of both short-term and long-term interest rates in all European countries previously suffering from stressed and elevated interest levels (as OMTs were regarded as an extra potential back-stop to <b>counter</b> the <b>frozen</b> liquidity and highly stressed rates; and just the knowledge about their potential existence {{in the very near future}} helped to calm the markets).|$|R
