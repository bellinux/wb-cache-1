5|$|The French did {{not pursue}} the Austrians {{immediately}} {{because they were}} exhausted from two straight days of vicious fighting. After recuperating, they <b>chased</b> <b>the</b> Austrians and caught up with them at Znaim in mid-July. Here Charles signed an armistice with Napoleon and agreed to end the fighting. Military conflict between France and Austria was effectively ended, although a few more months of diplomatic wrangling were required to make the result official.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte {{sought to}} invade Egypt {{as the first}} step in a {{campaign}} against British India, part of a greater effort to drive Britain out of the French Revolutionary Wars. As Bonaparte's fleet crossed the Mediterranean, it was pursued by a British force under Nelson who had been sent from the British fleet in the Tagus to learn the purpose of the French expedition and to defeat it. He <b>chased</b> <b>the</b> French for more than two months, on several occasions only missing them by a matter of hours. Bonaparte was aware of Nelson's pursuit and enforced absolute secrecy about his destination. He was able to capture Malta and then land in Egypt without interception by the British naval forces.|$|E
5|$|Maha Chakkraphat saw the Burmese army's retreat as an {{opportunity}} {{take advantage of their}} weakness, so he ordered Princes Ramesuan and Thammaracha to follow and harass the enemy out of Siamese territory.

Once the forces of Ramesuan and Thammaracha closed in, Tabinshwehti made a stand near Kamphaeng Phet, dividing his forces {{on both sides of the}} road. The Siamese in their eagerness fell into the trap. The Burmese captured both Prince Ramesuan and Maha Thammaracha as prisoners of war.|$|E

5|$|O'Flaherty {{interprets the}} myth of Prithu—his {{transformation}} from a hunter who <b>chased</b> <b>the</b> earth-cow to the herdsman-farmer—as a transition in Vedic or Hindu people from eating beef to having cow's milk and cultivated vegetables and grain instead of beef. David Shulman compares Prithu with the Vedic deity Rudra-Shiva. Prithu, like Rudra, is an ideal king, but with a violent side. Prithu's actions of chasing the earth-cow as a hunter and finally milking her, display this terrifying side of the king. Both, Prithu and Rudra, are closely associated with sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 18 June 1793 was {{the first}} decisive {{and one of the}} most celebrated {{encounters}} between British and French frigates during the French Revolutionary Wars. The action occurred off Start Point in Devon, when the British frigate HMS Nymphe encountered and <b>chased</b> <b>the</b> French frigate Cléopâtre. During the previous month, Cléopâtre and another frigate, Sémillante, had been successfully raiding British merchant shipping in the English Channel and Eastern Atlantic from their base at Cherbourg. In response, the British frigates Nymphe and HMS Venus had been ordered to intercept and defeat the French frigates and on 27 May Venus and Sémillante fought an inconclusive engagement off Cape Finisterre.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptian {{artillery}} {{failed to}} breach the walls, so Ibrahim decided to launch two ships with cannons {{and have them}} bombard the Maniot defences from the sea. He also combined this attack with infantry assaults, however these failed as the invaders were driven back from the walls eight times. The attacks lasted {{for a few more}} days before the Egyptians and Ottomans were forced to retreat when news arrived that Kolokotronis was approaching their rear with 2,000 men. The Maniots <b>chased</b> <b>the</b> Egyptians up to Kalamata before withdrawing. Ibrahim lost 2,500 men at Vergas and the Greek losses are unknown.|$|E

5|$|The next {{match was}} a tag team match between The Powers of Pain (The Barbarian and The Warlord), who were {{accompanied}} by their manager The Baron, and The Bolsheviks (Boris Zhukov and Nikolai Volkoff), who {{were accompanied by}} Slick. Immediately, The Powers of Pain <b>chased</b> <b>The</b> Bolsheviks from the ring. Slick, however, distracted The Powers of Pain long enough to give The Bolsheviks an advantage. Zhukov was then slammed to the mat back-first and headbutted from the top rope, which allowed The Barbarian to pin him.|$|E
5|$|The {{result was}} devastating. Five {{thousand}} French soldiers {{fell in a}} matter of minutes and the entire engagement stood on the brink of disaster. Not only did they face the Russian fire, but the French artillery pounded them as well. Augereau's Corps melted under the withering fire, the bayonets of the Russians, and the onslaught of the cavalry; as they retreated to their own lines, Napoleon was nearly captured at the Eylau churchyard, where he had established a lookout post, but his escort cavalry <b>chased</b> <b>the</b> Russians away.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} {{received}} by script editor Melinda M. Snodgrass at a fortunate time.

He passed it onto fellow executive producer Rick Berman, who held onto it for a week while the writers <b>chased</b> <b>the</b> production crew for updates. The script was then purchased, and Bailey, Bischoff and White were informed that it was due to go into production a week later.|$|E

5|$|Another {{part of the}} 5th Division had {{gathered}} unseen below Courtnay's Post, which was held by the 14th Battalion, and at 04:00 they rushed the trench, throwing hand grenades. The post was only defended by an Australian section, two of whom were killed and another two wounded; as the Turks occupied {{that part of the}} post the surviving Australians retreated. The Turks were now in a position to observe and bring fire down on Monash Valley. However, from another section of the post Private Albert Jacka led a small group of men in a counter-attack on the Turks. Jacka shot five of the Turks, bayoneted another two, and <b>chased</b> <b>the</b> rest out of the post. For this feat he was awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|In early May Cochrane was escorting {{a convoy}} from Cagliari to Leghorn. On 11May a ship {{which turned out}} to be the 6-gun {{privateer}} Intrépide was spotted capturing one of the merchant ships in the convoy, at which point Cochrane <b>chased</b> <b>the</b> Intrépide and forced her to surrender. Three days later, as the convoy passed the island of Montecristo, five rowing boats emerged from one of the island's coves and captured two of the rearmost merchant ships. Cochrane immediately gave chase, and recaptured them early the next morning. He was then given a free hand to raid enemy shipping in the area, and captured seven or eight vessels that June and July, including the 10-gun privateer Asuncion off Bastia on 25June and the privateer Constitution off Caprea on 19 July. On 22September he captured a large Neapolitan vessel and, on bringing her into Port Mahon, discovered that the Spanish had taken notice of his depredations and were preparing a frigate to capture Speedy.|$|E
5|$|Rowley's {{force had}} also been active: Nereide under Captain Robert Corbet {{captured}} {{a number of small}} vessels off Port Napoleon in the late spring, including the brig Aigle, which he sent to the Cape of Good Hope with a prize crew that mutinied, killed their officer and took the ship to Île Bonaparte. The brig HMS Otter, under Captain Nesbit Willoughby, raided an anchorage at Rivière Noire District on 14 August, capturing a coastal vessel (which he later had to abandon) under heavy fire. Willoughby also recaptured Aigle shortly afterwards. Rowley himself had <b>chased</b> <b>the</b> Bellone in Raisonnable as the French ship emerged from Port Napoleon on 17 August, but had been unable to catch her. Most significant of all was the seizure of the island of Rodriguez by a British Army force from India under Lieutenant Colonel Henry Keating. This small island was close enough to Isle de France to provide an effective base for the British blockade squadron and a staging area for a future invasion of the French islands.|$|E

5|$|The Action of 30 May 1798 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{between a}} small British squadron and a small French squadron {{off the coast of}} Normandy, France during the French Revolutionary Wars. A British blockadeing force, which had been conducting patrols in the region {{in the aftermath of the}} battle of St Marcou earlier in the month, encountered two French vessels attempting to sail unnoticed between Le Havre and Cherbourg. Closing with the French, the British commander Sir Francis Laforey sought to bring the French ships to battle as they attempted to turn back to Le Havre before the British squadron could attack. The French were unable to escape, and Laforey's ship, the fifth rate , engaged the French corvette Confiante, while two smaller British ships <b>chased</b> <b>the</b> Vésuve.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Pulo Aura {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} of the Napoleonic Wars, fought on 14 February 1804, in which a large convoy of Honourable East India Company (HEIC) East Indiamen, well-armed merchant ships, intimidated, drove off and chased a powerful French naval squadron. Although the French force was much stronger than the British convoy, Commodore Nathaniel Dance's aggressive tactics persuaded Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois to retire after only a brief exchange of shot. Dance then <b>chased</b> <b>the</b> French warships until his convoy was out of danger, whereupon he resumed his passage towards British India. Linois later claimed that the unescorted British merchant fleet was defended by eight ships of the line, a claim criticised by contemporary officers and later historians.|$|E
5|$|The {{kidnapping}} of Jaycee Dugard occurred on June 10, 1991, south of South Lake Tahoe, California. Dugard was 11 {{years old at}} the time and was abducted from a street while she was walking from home to a school bus stop. Searches began immediately after her disappearance, but no reliable leads were generated despite the fact that her stepfather, Carl Probyn, witnessed her kidnapping and <b>chased</b> <b>the</b> kidnappers on his mountain bike. Dugard remained missing until 2009, when a convicted sex offender, Phillip Garrido, visited the University of California campus in Berkeley accompanied by two young girls on August 24 and 25 that same year. The unusual behavior of the trio sparked an investigation that led Garrido's parole officer to order him to take the two girls to a parole office in Concord, California, on August 26. He was accompanied by a woman who was successfully identified as Jaycee Dugard who was by then 29 years old.|$|E
