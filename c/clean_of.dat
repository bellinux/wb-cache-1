5|$|Burying beetles are {{attentive}} parents, {{and participate}} in cooperative care and feeding of their offspring. Both parents work to bury small animal carcass {{to serve as a}} food resource for their young and build a brood chamber around it. The parents prepare the carcass and protect it from competitors and from early decomposition. After their eggs hatch, the parents keep the larvae <b>clean</b> <b>of</b> fungus and bacteria and help the larvae feed by regurgitating food for them.|$|E
5|$|Boxwood {{cut across}} the end-grain is hard enough for fine engraving, {{allowing}} greater detail than in normal woodcutting. This been the dominant method used since Bewick's time. In addition, since a wood engraving is inked on the face, it requires only low pressure to print an image, so the blocks last for many thousands of prints, and importantly can be assembled into a page of metal type for ordinary printing in a single run. In contrast, a copper plate engraving is inked in the engraved grooves, the face being wiped <b>clean</b> <b>of</b> ink before printing, so much higher pressure is required, and images must be printed separately from the text, at far greater expense.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the campaigning {{season of}} 1864, Cleburne became engaged to Susan Tarleton of Mobile, Alabama. Their {{marriage}} {{was never to}} be, as Cleburne was killed during an ill-conceived assault (which he opposed) on Union fortifications at the Battle of Franklin, just south of Nashville, Tennessee, on November 30, 1864. He was last seen advancing on foot toward the Union line with his sword raised, after his horse was shot out from under him. Accounts later {{said that he was}} found just inside the Federal line and his body carried back to an aid station along the Columbia Turnpike. Confederate war records indicate he died of a shot to the abdomen, or possibly a bullet that went through his heart. When Confederates found his body, he had been picked <b>clean</b> <b>of</b> any valuable items, including his sword, boots and pocket watch.|$|E
5|$|When Baxter {{returned}} to Batesville, he organized the 4th Arkansas Mounted Infantry for the Union and commanded {{it until he}} was named a State Supreme Court judge by Governor Murphy in the Spring 1864. Shortly after being named a judge, {{he was elected to}} the U.S. Senate by the legislature along with Rev. Andrew Hunter, but they were not seated in the Senate as the senate did not recognize the Murphy Administration. In 1867, he was appointed by Governor Clayton judge of the 3rd Judicial circuit. In 1868 he was appointed the 1st Congressional district of Arkansas. He held these two positions until he was nominated for governor in 1872. Baxter was virtually unknown and privately <b>clean</b> <b>of</b> scandals, unlike most of the Minstrels. They believed he could attract votes from Unionists and Northerners, their core base, as well as natives of the state.|$|E

25|$|The Akapana East {{was built}} on the eastern side of early Tiwanaku. Later it was {{considered}} a boundary between the ceremonial center and the urban area.

It was swept <b>clean</b> <b>of</b> all domestic refuse, signaling its great importance to the culture.|$|E

25|$|High heels are not {{a modern}} {{invention}} but there is confusion regarding when they were developed. Research shows that high heels {{can be traced back}} to ancient Egypt. In the middle of the second millennium BC, Egyptians began to frequently use sandals. Retention was obtained generally by the Egyptians by a T or V thong passing through the sole. Egyptian butchers also wore heeled shoes for practical purposes, in order to keep their feet <b>clean</b> <b>of</b> any blood while slaughtering animals. Also, a 12th-century (AD) sculpture from Ramappa Temple (India) shows a lady, highly clad in jewelry, wearing high heels.|$|E
25|$|Chalicotherium, {{like many}} members of Perissodactyla, was adapted to browsing, though uniquely adapted to do so among its {{ungulate}} relatives. Its arms were long and heavily clawed, allowing them to walk on their knuckles only. The arms were used {{to reach for the}} branches of large trees and bring them close to its long head to strip them <b>clean</b> <b>of</b> leaves. The horse-like head itself shows adaptation to a diet of soft vegetation, since, as the animal reached sexual maturity, the incisors and upper canines were shed, suggesting that its muscular lips and the resulting gum pads were enough to crop fodder which was then processed by squarish, low-crowned molars.|$|E
25|$|One famous bakeneko {{story is}} about a man named Takasu Genbei, whose mother’s {{personality}} changed completely after his pet cat went missing for many years. His mother avoided the company {{of friends and family}} and would take her meals alone in her room. When the family peeked in on her, they saw a cat-like monster in the mother's clothes, chewing on animal carcasses. Takasu, still skeptical, slew what looked like his mother, and after one day his mother's body turned back into his pet cat that had been missing. Takasu then tore up the floorboards of his mother's room to find her skeleton hidden there, her bones gnawed <b>clean</b> <b>of</b> all flesh.|$|E

25|$|It is {{impossible}} for a German soldier to distinguish between partisans and non-partisans... The regiment's {{view is that the}} area must be subdivided into a) pacified areas, b) areas threatened by gangs, c) gang infested areas. In areas threatened by gangs the men should be permitted to leave town and work only in groups; all males passing through such areas alone or in small groups must be shot or imprisoned at once... The bandit infested area must be swept <b>clean</b> <b>of</b> all males. Up to specific point in time, males up to the age of 50 will be seized and turned over to the economic office as laborers. After the deadline, men in this area will be shot.|$|E
25|$|After {{numerous}} attempts {{to convince him}} to start a serious rehab, in early 2005 Doherty's father decided {{he was tired of}} broken promises and vowed not to see his son again until he was <b>clean</b> <b>of</b> drugs. The sensitivity surrounding the issue became apparent in the BBC Two Arena documentary about Doherty, on 12 November 2006, which included footage of him talking about this aspect of his personal life. He was visibly upset and had to politely ask the interviewer at one point to stop filming. In October 2007, Doherty explained {{in an interview with the}} BBC Radio 4 show Front Row that he had briefly reconciled with his father after three years when his father visited him in rehab, but were estranged again over drugs.|$|E
25|$|The start zone of an {{avalanche}} must be steep {{enough to allow}} snow to accelerate once set in motion, additionally convex slopes are less stable than concave slopes, because of the disparity between the tensile strength of snow layers and their compressive strength. The composition {{and structure of the}} ground surface beneath the snowpack influences the stability of the snowpack, either being a source of strength or weakness. Avalanches are unlikely to form in very thick forests, but boulders and sparsely distributed vegetation can create weak areas deep within the snowpack through the formation of strong temperature gradients. Full-depth avalanches (avalanches that sweep a slope virtually <b>clean</b> <b>of</b> snow cover) are more common on slopes with smooth ground, such as grass or rock slabs.|$|E
