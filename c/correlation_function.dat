The corresponding <b>correlation</b> <b>functions</b> are explicitly {{expressed in terms of}} <b>correlation</b> <b>functions</b> of two independent WZNW theories for g and h. Coset theories is an important subclass of two-dimensional conformal invariant QFT’s. (For a review see [1].) The g/h coset theory is based on the Virasoro algebra generated by [2, 3] K(m) = L g (m) − L h (m), m ∈ Z. (1) The operator L g (m) is a conformal generator of the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten (WZNW) [4 - 6] theory for the Lie algebra g and h ⊂ g.
