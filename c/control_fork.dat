To characterize the mechanisms <b>controlling</b> <b>fork</b> integrity, we analyzed replication intermediates formed in response to replication blocks using electron microscopy. At the forks, wild-type cells accumulate short single-stranded regions, which likely causes checkpoint activation, whereas rad 53 mutants exhibit extensive single-stranded gaps and hemi-replicated intermediates, consistent with a lagging-strand synthesis defect. Further, rad 53 cells accumulate Holliday junctions through fork reversal.

However, evidence that Rad 53 directly modulates the activity of replication forks has been lacking, and the nature of fork stabilization has remained unclear. Recently, cells lacking the Psy 2 -Pph 3 phosphatase were shown to be defective in dephosphorylation of Rad 53 as well as replication fork restart after DNA damage, suggesting a mechanistic link between Rad 53 deactivation and fork restart. To test this possibility we examined the progression of replication forks in methyl-methanesulfonate (MMS) -damaged cells, under different conditions of Rad 53 activity. Hyperactivity of Rad 53 in pph 3 Delta cells slows fork progression in MMS, whereas deactivation of Rad 53, through expression of dominant-negative Rad 53 -KD, is sufficient to allow fork restart during recovery. Furthermore, combined deletion of PPH 3 and PTC 2, a second, unrelated Rad 53 phosphatase, results in complete replication fork arrest and lethality in MMS, demonstrating that Rad 53 deactivation is a key mechanism <b>controlling</b> <b>fork</b> restart.

40|$|SummaryIn {{response}} to replication stress, the Mec 1 /ATR and SUMO pathways control stalled- and damaged-fork stability. We investigated the S phase response at forks encountering a broken template (termed the terminal fork). We show that double-strand break (DSB) formation can locally trigger dormant origin firing. Irreversible fork resolution {{at the break}} does not impede progression of the other fork in the same replicon (termed the sister fork). The Mre 11 -Tel 1 /ATM response acts at terminal forks, preventing accumulation of cruciform DNA intermediates that tether sister chromatids and can undergo nucleolytic processing. We conclude that sister forks can be uncoupled during replication and that, after DSB-induced fork termination, replication is rescued by dormant origin firing or adjacent replicons.

40|$|Telomere {{integrity}} is maintained through end-protection proteins that block nuclease degradation and prevent telomeres from being recognized as DNA breaks. Although less well understood, end protection proteins may {{also play a}} role in facilitating telomere replication. Here, we show that overproduction (OP) of the yeast telomere capping protein Stn 1 makes cells highly sensitive to the replication inhibitors hydroxyurea (HU) and methyl-methane sulfonate (MMS). Unexpectedly, this sensitivity corresponds with Stn 1 OP blocking most, if not all, aspects of the S phase checkpoint. The checkpoint kinase Rad 53 is phosphorylated with normal timing in Stn 1 OP cells, indicating Stn 1 does not interfere with signaling steps involved in activating the checkpoint. Part of the role of Stn 1 in telomere {{integrity is}} mediated through the Pol 12 subunit of DNA polymerase α (Polα). We show that overproduced Stn 1 generally associates with chromosomes in HU treated and untreated cells, and, remarkably, Stn 1 chromosome binding and OP checkpoint defects are rescued in pol 12 mutants. We propose Stn 1 normally promotes Polα activity at telomeres but can be recruited through Pol 12 to nontelomeric sites when overproduced.

In response to developmental signals, specific genomic regions undergo amplification by repeated firing of replication origins and bidirectional movement of replication forks for ≈ 50 kb in each direction. Previous work focused on initiation of amplification, defining replication origins, establishing {{the role of}} the prereplication complex and origin recognition complex (ORC), and uncovering regulatory functions for the Myb, E 2 F 1, and Rb transcription factors. Here, we exploit follicle cell amplification to investigate the control of DNA replication fork progression and termination, poorly understood processes in metazoans. We identified a mutant in which, during gene amplification, the replication forks move twice as far from the origin compared with wild type. This phenotype is the result of an amino acid substitution mutation in the cyclinE gene, cyclinE 1 f 36. The rate of oogenesis is normal in cyclinE 1 f 36 /cyclinEPz 8 mutant ovaries, indicating that increased replication fork progression is due to increased replication fork speed, possibly from increased processivity. The increased amplification domains observed in the mutant imply that there are not replication fork barriers preventing replication forks from progressing beyond the normal 100 -kb amplified region.
