40|$|A quantum {{channel is}} derived for <b>continuous</b> <b>variable</b> {{teleportation}} which is performed {{by means of}} an arbitrary entangled state and the standard protocol. When a Gaussian entangled state such as a two-mode squeezed-vacuum state is used, the <b>continuous</b> <b>variable</b> teleportation is equivalent to the thermalizing quantum channel. <b>Continuous</b> <b>variable</b> dense coding is also considered. Both the <b>continuous</b> <b>variable</b> teleportation and the <b>continuous</b> <b>variable</b> dense coding are characterized by the same function determined by the entangled state and the quantum measurement.

25|$|As a consequence, {{the quantum}} state of a {{particle}} with spin {{is described by}} a vector-valued wave function with values in C2S+1. Equivalently, it is represented by a complex-valued function of four variables: one discrete quantum number variable (for the spin) {{is added to the}} usual three <b>continuous</b> <b>variables</b> (for the position in space).|$|E
25|$|Because {{variables}} conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements {{cannot be}} reasonably measured numerically, {{sometimes they are}} grouped together as categorical variables, whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as quantitative variables, which can be either discrete or continuous, due to their numerical nature. Such distinctions can often be loosely correlated with data type in computer science, in that dichotomous categorical variables may be represented with the Boolean data type, polytomous categorical variables with arbitrarily assigned integers in the integral data type, and <b>continuous</b> <b>variables</b> with the real data type involving floating point computation. But the mapping of computer science data types to statistical data types depends on which categorization of the latter is being implemented.|$|E

We determine conditions under which the group can reach a consensus on the value of the <b>continuous</b> <b>variable,</b> conditions under which the group fails to reach an agreement on the up-or-down vote, and when the outcome of a successful up-or-down vote matches the consensus on the <b>continuous</b> <b>variable.</b> We also consider the impact of unanimous versus nonunanimous voting rules. ...|$|R

30|$|In {{categorical}} {{data analysis}} with econometric approach {{existence of a}} continuous unobserved or latent variable underlying an observed categorical variable is presumed. Categorical variable is the observed as different discrete values when the unobserved <b>continuous</b> <b>variable</b> crosses a threshold value. Therefore, the inference is based on observed discrete values which are only indicative of the intervals to which unobserved <b>continuous</b> <b>variable</b> belongs but not its true values.

5000|$|Entropy: While {{the entropy of}} a {{discrete}} variable is location-invariant and scale-independent, and therefore not a measure of dispersion in the above sense, the entropy of a <b>continuous</b> <b>variable</b> is location invariant and additive in scale: If Hz is the entropy of <b>continuous</b> <b>variable</b> z and y=ax+b, then Hy=Hx+log(a).|$|R

However, in present experimental demonstrations, the secret key can be distilled only under very small loss rates. Here, by calculating explicitly the computational complexity with the channel transmission, we show that under high loss rate it is hard to distill the secret key in present <b>continuous</b> <b>variable</b> scheme and one of its advantages, the potential of providing high secret key rate, may therefore be limited.
