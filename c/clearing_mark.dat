Most skeletons we excavate have <b>clear</b> <b>marks</b> of old wounds. To survive and raise their young, the predators needed more than sharp teeth and strong claws. They needed social bonds."

Manifestations like ‘exergy’ and ‘entropy generation minimization’ (EGM) have acquired scientific renown and are applied in different engineering disciplines. This paper assesses these Second Law manifestations in engineering design.

Opportunities and promises of both exergy and EGM are verified while pitfalls are addressed and tackled using a new component-based iterative design approach. It is found that this iterative design approach is promising but inherently case dependent. status: publishe...|$|R
