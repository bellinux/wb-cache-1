5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When you left I lost {{a part of}} me / It’s still so hard to believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would – you <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at the grocery store and this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect – and perfectly universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E
25|$|As a final check one <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> {{frame of}} {{reference}} rotating along with the train. Such frame would be rotating at twice the angular velocity as Earth's rotating frame. The resulting centrifugal force component for that imaginary frame would be greater. Since the train and its passengers are at rest, {{that would be the}} only component in that frame explaining again why the train and the passengers are lighter than in the previous two cases.|$|E
25|$|One <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> {{stack of}} {{hyperbolic}} disks where each disk represents {{the state of}} the universe at a given time. The resulting geometric object is three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. It looks like a solid cylinder in which any cross section is a copy of the hyperbolic disk. Time runs along the vertical direction in this picture. The surface of this cylinder {{plays an important role in}} the AdS/CFT correspondence. As with the hyperbolic plane, anti-de Sitter space is curved in such a way that any point in the interior is actually infinitely far from this boundary surface.|$|E

5000|$|A {{review of}} Lowry’s {{publication}} will suggest reasons why his {{approach has been}} widely adopted. The publication was the first full elaboration of a model, data analysis and handling problems, and computations. Lowry’s writing is excellent.

500|$|... "Everyone Nose" [...] {{was written}} by Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo, who also {{produced}} the song as The Neptunes. The title of the song derives from the subject of women snorting cocaine socially in bathrooms. N.E.R.D attested that, [...] "when the girls go in the bathroom, they're powdering their faces with that other white stuff." [...] Andrew Coleman, the band's engineer, explained the song's bridge, saying it is the [...] "breakdown" [...] of the girl: [...] "you <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> girl who is totally coked {{out of her mind}} dancing and sweating." ...|$|E
500|$|The show's {{crew and}} actors had {{a range of}} {{opinions}} about the show's finale, [...] "The Truth". Carter said of the finale, [...] "It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. There were things to distract from what was going on. The band was breaking up." [...] Gish said, [...] "It did feel like a big movie set. We were on location, there was an enormous budget, and everyone came back." [...] Davis said, [...] "It was great that they brought us all back in the finale, that they {{found a way to}} get us all in again." [...] Pileggi said, [...] "I can remember the last day on the set. We shot a scene with Gillian and myself, and that was it. And then I had to say goodbye to another family, another crew. I almost teared up, and Gillian was standing there looking at me saying 'Okay, go ahead, big guy; get through this.' It was tough." [...] Patrick said, [...] "It was pretty euphoric, and sad, and all those emotions you <b>can</b> <b>imagine.</b> <b>A</b> chapter's closing, and we're all moving on to something new and exciting. And yet we were all going to miss each other." [...] Kim Manners called the final scene [...] "truly one of the most emotional experiences I've ever witnessed in my life." [...] Former lead actor Duchovny said, [...] "In some ways, psychically I didn't really leave. It was {{nice to be able to}} – I'm just really happy that I was able to come back and finish it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Two main {{types are}} found, a beaker and a lamp. The beaker is a pot-bellied pot {{narrowing}} at the neck, with a flanged, outward turning rim. The bottom was typically formed into a point or bulb (the [...] "funnel") {{of some sort}} that supported the pot when it was placed in clay or sand. One <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> sort of mobile pantry consisting of rows of jars set now in the hut, now by the fire, now in the clay layer {{at the bottom of}} a dugout.|$|E
2500|$|All {{mainstream}} {{methods of}} DNA sequencing rely on reading small fragments of DNA and subsequently reconstructing these data to infer the original DNA target, either via assembly or alignment to a reference. The abstraction common to these methods {{is that of}} a mathematical covering problem. For example, one <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> line segment representing the target and a subsequent process where smaller segments are [...] "dropped" [...] onto random locations of the target. The target is considered [...] "sequenced" [...] when adequate coverage accumulates (e.g., when no gaps remain).|$|E
2500|$|Some {{defenders}} of Warren-style arguments grant that these problems {{have not yet}} been fully solved, but reply that the [...] "natural capacities" [...] view fares no better. [...] It is argued, for example, that as human beings vary significantly in their natural cognitive capacities (some are naturally more intelligent than others), and as one <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> series or spectrum of species with gradually diminishing natural capacities (for example, a series from humans down to amoebae with only the slightest differences in natural capacities between each successive species), therefore the problems of arbitrariness and inequality will apply equally to the [...] "natural capacities" [...] view. In other words, there is a continuum not only of developed but of natural capacities, and so the [...] "natural capacities" [...] view will inevitably face these problems as well.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{possible}} to [...] "visualize" [...] its convergence on the real number line: we <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> line of length 2, with successive segments marked off of lengths 1, ½, ¼, etc. There is always room to mark the next segment, because the amount of line remaining {{is always the same}} as the last segment marked: when we have marked off ½, we still have a piece of length ½ unmarked, so we can certainly mark the next¼. [...] This argument does not prove that the sum is equal to 2 (although it is), but it does prove that it is at most2. [...] In other words, the series has an upper bound. Given that the series converges, proving that it is equal to 2 requires only elementary algebra. If the series is denoted , {{it can be seen that}} ...|$|E
2500|$|Vladimir Putin, after {{attending}} the Beijing Olympics, suddenly arrived in North Ossetia on 9 August to monitor a [...] "humanitarian operation". Putin {{arrived in the}} evening and his meeting with the military was broadcast, demonstrating Putin's superiority over Medvedev. Putin said that dozens of South Ossetians were killed. He stated that Russia would no longer support Georgia's claim to the breakaway territory, [...] "There is almost no way we <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> return to the status quo." [...] Putin said that about 34,000 refugees from South Ossetia were registered so far. Putin said, [...] "The actions of the Georgian powers in South Ossetia are, of course, a crime — first of all against their own people. The territorial integrity of Georgia has suffered a fatal blow." [...] He said US$425 million for aid would be donated to South Ossetia by the Russian government. Putin's spokesperson claimed that the visit to Vladikavkaz had [...] "no military component".|$|E
2500|$|The Proslogion ( [...] , [...] "Discourse"), {{originally}} entitled Faith Seeking Understanding (...) {{and then}} An Address on God's Existence (...) , was written {{over the next}} two years (1077–1078). It is written in the form of an extended direct address to God. It grew out of his dissatisfaction with the Monologion's interlinking and contingent arguments. His [...] "single argument that needed nothing but itself alone for proof, that would by itself be enough to show that God really exists" [...] is commonly taken to be merely the second chapter of the work. In it, Anselm reasoned that even atheists <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> greatest being, having such attributes that nothing greater could exist (...) [...] However, if such a being's attributes did not include existence, a still greater being could be imagined: one with all of the attributes of the first and existence. Therefore, the truly greatest possible being must necessarily exist. Further, this necessarily-existing greatest being must be God, who therefore necessarily exists. This reasoning was known to the Scholastics as [...] "Anselm's argument" [...] (...) but it became known as the ontological argument for the existence of God following Kant's treatment of it.|$|E
