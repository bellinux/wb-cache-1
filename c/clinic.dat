5|$|During Sanger's 1916 {{speaking}} tour, she promoted {{birth control}} clinics {{based on the}} Dutch model she had observed during her 1914 trip to Europe. Although she inspired many local communities to create birth control leagues, no clinics were established. Sanger therefore resolved to create a birth control <b>clinic</b> in New York that would provide free contraceptive services to women. New York state law prohibited the distribution of contraceptives or even contraceptive information, but Sanger hoped to exploit {{a provision in the}} law which permitted doctors to prescribe contraceptives for the prevention of disease. On October 16, 1916, she opened the Brownsville <b>clinic</b> in Brooklyn; it was an immediate success, with over 100 women visiting on the first day.Engelman, p. 79–80. A few days after opening, an undercover policewoman purchased a cervical cap at the <b>clinic,</b> and Sanger was arrested. Refusing to walk, Sanger and a co-worker were dragged out of the <b>clinic</b> by police officers.Engelman, p. 83. The <b>clinic</b> was shut down, and it was not until 1923 that another birth control <b>clinic</b> was opened in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Four {{years after}} the New York Court of Appeals opened the doors for {{physicians}} to prescribe contraceptives, Sanger opened a second birth control <b>clinic,</b> which she staffed with physicians to make it legal under that court ruling (the first <b>clinic</b> had employed nurses). This second <b>clinic,</b> the Clinical Research Bureau (CRB), opened on January 2, 1923. To avoid police harassment the clinic's existence was not publicized, its primary mission was stated to be conducting scientific research, and it only provided services to married women. The existence of the <b>clinic</b> was finally announced {{to the public in}} December 1923, but this time there were no arrests or controversy. This convinced activists that, after ten years of struggle, birth control had finally become widely accepted in the United States. The CRB was the first legal birth control <b>clinic</b> in the United States, and quickly grew into the world's leading contraceptive research center.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare quality of care for patients with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in specialized vs. general <b>clinics.</b> METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective chart review evaluating compliance with a set of STD-related process of care quality indicators for adult patients seen in six Los Angeles County <b>clinics</b> (two STD specialized <b>clinics</b> and four general medical <b>clinics).</b> RESULTS: Thirty-two quality indicators were selected using a modified Delphi process. From March 1, 1996, to June 31, 1996, there were 205 STD-related visits to the two specialized STD <b>clinics</b> and 373 STD-related visits to the four general medical <b>clinics.</b> For patients with "classic" STDs (those for which sexual contact is the primary means of transmission), STD <b>clinics</b> achieved greater compliance than general medical <b>clinics</b> on 14 quality indicators, while general medical <b>clinics</b> achieved greater compliance on 4 indicators. CONCLUSION: STD <b>clinics</b> provide better overall STD care than general medical <b>clinics.</b> Possible explanations include differences in clinician experience with STD patients and greater use of standardized protocol sheets...|$|R

5|$|In April 1930, Zelda was {{admitted}} to a sanatorium in France where, after months of observation and treatment and a consultation with one of Europe's leading psychiatrists, Doctor Eugen Bleuler, she was diagnosed as a schizophrenic.

The <b>clinic</b> primarily treated gastrointestinal ailments, and because of her profound psychological problems she was moved to a psychiatric facility, in Prangins {{on the shores of}} Lake Geneva. She was released in September 1931, and the Fitzgeralds returned to Montgomery, Alabama, where her father, Judge Sayre, was dying. Amid her family's bereavement, Scott announced that he was leaving for Hollywood. Zelda's father died while Scott was gone, and her health again deteriorated.

5|$|In {{spite of}} these suspicions, many African-American leaders {{supported}} efforts to supply birth control to the African-American community. In 1929, James H. Hubert, a black social worker and leader of New York's Urban League, asked Sanger to open a <b>clinic</b> in Harlem.Engelman, p. 160. Sanger secured funding from the Julius Rosenwald Fund and opened the <b>clinic,</b> staffed with African-American doctors, in 1930. The <b>clinic</b> was guided by a 15-member advisory board consisting of African-American doctors, nurses, clergy, journalists, and social workers. It was publicized in the African-American press and African-American churches, and received the approval of W. E. B. Du Bois, co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In the early 1940s, the Birth Control Federation of America (BCFA) initiated a program called the Negro Project, managed by its Division of Negro Service (DNS).Engelman, pp. 175–177. As with the Harlem <b>clinic,</b> the primary aim of the DNS and its programs was to improve maternal and infant health. Based on her work at the Harlem <b>clinic,</b> Sanger suggested to the DNS that African Americans {{were more likely to}} take advice from a doctor of their own race, but other leaders prevailed and insisted that whites be employed in the outreach efforts. The discriminatory actions and statements by the movement's leaders during the 1920s and 1930s have led to continuing allegations that the movement was racist.Allegations of racism can be found in Franks, Angela (2005), Margaret Sanger's Eugenic Legacy: The Control of Female Fertility, McFarland; and in Davis, Angela (1981), Women, Race, and Class.|$|E
