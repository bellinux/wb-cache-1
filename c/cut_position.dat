In this contribution we deal only with parameters in time domain, such as mean square and mean absolute error, image fidelity, normalized cross-correlation, Czekanowski distance and normalized distance. All functions are tested with a video sequence containing two cuts. Finally, a qualitative comparison of proposed methods is performed. For the cut detection in time domain is sufficient to use only two parameters: mean absolute error and normalized distance.

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanical}} {{modeling of}} rubber-like materials {{within the framework}} of nonlinear elasticity theory is well established. The application of such modeling to soft biomaterials is currently the subject of intense investigation. For soft biomaterials {{it is well known that}} exponential strain energy density models are particularly useful as they reflect the typical J-shaped stress-stretch stiffening response that is observed experimentally. The most celebrated of these models for isotropic hyperelastic materials are those of Fung and Demiray which depends only on the first strain invariant and its generalization by Vito that depends on both strain invariants. In the limit as the strain-stiffening parameter tends to zero, one recovers the neo-Hookean and Mooney–Rivlin models that are linear functions of the invariants. Here we apply these models to the analysis of the fracture or tearing of soft biomaterials. Attention is focused on a particular fracture test namely the trousers test where two legs of a cut specimen are pulled horizontally apart out of the plane of the test piece. It is shown that, in general, the location of the cut in the specimen plays a key role in the fracture analysis, and that the effect of the <b>cut</b> <b>position</b> depends crucially on the constitutive model employed. This dependence is characterized explicitly for the strain-stiffening exponential constitutive models considered. In contrast to the situation for rubber, our findings show that the critical driving force and fracture toughness in tearing of some soft biomaterials in the trousers test are virtually independent of the <b>cut</b> <b>position...</b>|$|E

40|$|Trypsin is {{the most}} used enzyme in {{proteomics}} experiments to convert proteins into peptides as it has a high substrate specificity, it cuts exclusively after arginine and lysine residues. A typical problem is to identify an unknown protein: The protein is cleaved with trypsin and after mass spectrometry, the resulting spectra are compared to theoretical spectra to allow for an identification of the unknown peptides and thus of the unknown protein. The size of the search space {{is dependent on the}} number of possible peptides which is quadratic in the number of possible cleavage positions. Accurately predicting cleavage or miscleavage thus reduces the search space. In our work we use machine learning techniques to learn a model capable of predicting trypsin cleavage based on the primary structure of a protein and a possible <b>cut</b> <b>position</b> in the sequence. We allow a number of tests on the amino acids type and/or their properties within a window around the possible <b>cut</b> <b>position,</b> e. g. “Is there a amino acid with neutral charge two positions after the cut position?” or “Is there a proline within distance one of the cut position?” We learn a random forest, a set of decision trees where each tree is generated by using a random subset of the test set, and the actual prediction is generated by aggregating the predicted values of the trees in the forest. We compare the random forest with respect to an existing rules set, the so called “Keil rules”. The forest was learned on a homogeneous dataset retrieved from PRIDE by selecting all 681 193 examples containing trypsin cleavage information. Evaluated on the PRIDE dataset, it attains an AUROC of 96 %, an improvement of 28 % with respect to the Keil rules. The two models are also evaluated on three independent datasets: the iPRG-dataset (9694 examples), the CPTAC-dataset (23842 examples) and the MS LIMS-dataset (26079 examples). Our method achieves AUROC scores of 84 % to 90 %, significantly outperforming the Keil rules set with an average improvement in AUROC of 17. 9 %. We therefore conclude that our trypsin cleavage predictor favorably compares with respect to state-of-the-art models. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We {{experimentally}} investigate various processes {{present in}} the photoassociative interaction of an ultracold atomic sample with shaped femtosecond laser pulses as an detailed extension of previous work. We demonstrate the photoassociation of pairs of rubidium atoms into electronically excited, bound molecular states using spectrally cut femtosecond laser pulses tuned below the rubidium D 1 or D 2 asymptote. Time-resolved pump-probe spectra reveal oscillations of the molecular formation rate, which are due to coherent transient dynamics in the electronic excitation. The oscillation frequency corresponds to the detuning of the spectral <b>cut</b> <b>position</b> to the asymptotic transition frequency of the rubidium D 1 or D 2 lines, respectively. Measurements of the molecular photoassociation signal {{as a function of}} the pulse energy reveal a nonlinear dependence and indicate a nonperturbative excitation process. Chirping the association laser pulse allowed us to change the phase of the coh erent transients. Furthermore, a signature for molecules in the electronic ground state is found, which is attributed to molecule formation by femtosecond photoassociation followed by spontaneous decay. In a subsequent article quantum mechanical calculations are presented, which compare well with the experimental data and reveal further details about the observed coherent transient dynamics...|$|E

40|$|In optical {{character}} recognition of very old books, the recognition accuracy drops mainly due to the merging or breaking of characters. In this paper, we propose the first algorithm to segment merged Kannada characters by using a hypothesis to select the positions to be cut. This method searches for the best possible positions to segment, by {{taking into account the}} support vector machine classifier's recognition score and the validity of the aspect ratio (width to height ratio) of the segments between every pair of cut positions. The hypothesis to select the <b>cut</b> <b>position</b> is {{based on the fact that}} a concave surface exists above and below the touching portion. These concave surfaces are noted down by tracing the valleys in the top contour of the image and similarly doing it for the image rotated upside-down. The cut positions are then derived as closely matching valleys of the original and the rotated images. Our proposed segmentation algorithm works well for different font styles, shapes and sizes better than the existing vertical projection profile based segmentation. The proposed algorithm has been tested on 1125 different word images, each containing multiple merged characters, from an old Kannada book and 89. 6 % correct segmentation is achieved and the character recognition accuracy of merged words is 91. 2 %. A few points of merge are still missed due to the absence of a matched valley due to the specific shapes of the particular characters meeting at the merges...|$|E
40|$|When {{grafting}} or wounding disconnects stem tissues, new tissues {{are generated}} {{to restore the}} lost connection. In this study, the molecular mechanism of such healing was elucidated in injured stems of Arabidopsis. Soon after the inflorescence stems were incised, the pith cells started to divide. This process was strongly inhibited by the elimination of cauline leaves, shoot apices, or lateral buds that reduced the indole- 3 -acetic acid supply. Microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that genes related to cell division, phytohormones, and transcription factors were expressed because of incision. Among them, two plant-specific transcription factor genes, ANAC 071 and RAP 2. 6 L, were abundantly expressed. ANAC 071 was expressed at 1 – 3 d after cutting exclusively in the upper region of the cut gap, with concomitant accumulation of indole- 3 -acetic acid. In contrast, RAP 2. 6 L was expressed at 1 d after cutting exclusively in the lower region, with concomitant deprivation of indole- 3 -acetic acid. The expression of ANAC 071 and RAP 2. 6 L were also promoted by ethylene and jasmonic acid, respectively. In transformants suppressing the function of RAP 2. 6 L or ANAC 071, the division of pith cells was inhibited. Furthermore, the ethylene signaling-defective ein 2 mutant showed incomplete healing. Hence, plant-specific transcription factors differentially expressed around the <b>cut</b> <b>position</b> were essential for tissue reunion of Arabidopsis wounded flowering stems and were under opposite control by polar-transported auxin, with modification by the ethylene and jasmonic acid wound-inducible hormones...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Identification of the {{structural}} domains of proteins is important for {{our understanding of the}} organizational principles and mechanisms of protein folding, and for insights into protein function and evolution. Algorithmic methods of dissecting protein of known structure into domains developed so far are based on an examination of multiple geometrical, physical and topological features. Successful as many of these approaches are, they employ a lot of heuristics, and {{it is not clear whether}} they illuminate any deep underlying principles of protein domain organization. Other well-performing domain dissection methods rely on comparative sequence analysis. These methods are applicable to sequences with known and unknown structure alike, and their success highlights a fundamental principle of protein modularity, but this does not directly improve our understanding of protein spatial structure. Results We present a novel graph-theoretical algorithm for the identification of domains in proteins with known three-dimensional structure. We represent the protein structure as an undirected, unweighted and unlabeled graph whose nodes correspond to the secondary structure elements and edges represent physical proximity of at least one pair of alpha carbon atoms from two elements. Domains are identified as constrained partitions of the graph, corresponding to sets of vertices obtained by the maximization of the cycle distributions found in the graph. When a partition is found, the algorithm is iteratively applied to each of the resulting subgraphs. The decision to accept or reject a tentative <b>cut</b> <b>position</b> is based on a specific classifier. The algorithm is applied iteratively to each of the resulting subgraphs and terminates automatically if partitions are no longer accepted. The distribution of cycles is the only type of information on which the decision about protein dissection is based. Despite the barebone simplicity of the approach, our algorithm approaches the best heuristic algorithms in accuracy. Conclusion Our graph-theoretical algorithm uses only topological information present in the protein structure itself to find the domains and does not rely on any geometrical or physical information about protein molecule. Perhaps unexpectedly, these drastic constraints on resources, which result in a seemingly approximate description of protein structures and leave only a handful of parameters available for analysis, do not lead to any significant deterioration of algorithm accuracy. It appears that protein structures can be rigorously treated as topological rather than geometrical objects and that the majority of information about protein domains can be inferred from the coarse-grained measure of pairwise proximity between elements of secondary structure elements. </p...|$|E

40|$|During final {{preparations}} for {{start of the}} PDCF Inner Can (IC) qualification effort, welding was performed on an automated weld system known as the PICN. During the initial weld, using a pedigree canister and plug, a weld defect was observed. The defect resulted in {{a hole in the}} sidewall of the canister, and it was observed that the plug sidewall had not been consumed. This was a new type of failure not seen during development and production of legacy Bagless Transfer Cans (FB-Line/Hanford). Therefore, a team was assembled to determine the root cause and to determine if the process could be improved. After several brain storming sessions (MS and T, R and D Engineering, PDC Project), an evaluation matrix was established to direct this effort. The matrix identified numerous activities that could be taken and then prioritized those activities. This effort was limited by both time and resources (the number of canisters and plugs available for testing was limited). A discovery process was initiated to evaluate the Vendor's IC fabrication process relative to legacy processes. There were no significant findings, however, some information regarding forging/anneal processes could not be obtained. Evaluations were conducted to compare mechanical properties of the PDC canisters relative to the legacy canisters. Some differences were identified, but mechanical properties were determined to be consistent with legacy materials. A number of process changes were also evaluated. A heat treatment procedure was established that could reduce the magnetic characteristics to levels similar to the legacy materials. An in-situ arc annealing process was developed that resulted in improved weld characteristics for test articles. Also several tack welds configurations were addressed, it was found that increasing the number of tack welds (and changing the sequence) resulted in decreased can to plug gaps and a more stable weld for test articles. Incorporating all of the process improvements for the actual can welding process, however, did not result in an improved weld geometry. Several possibilities for the lack of positive response exist, some of which are that (1) an insufficient number of test articles were welded under prototypic conditions, (2) the process was not optimized so that significant improvements were observable over the 'noise', and (3) the in-situ arc anneal closed the gap down too much so the can was unable to exhaust pressure ahead of the weld. Several operational and mechanical improvements were identified. The weld clamps were changed to a design consistent with those used in the legacy operations. A helium puff operation was eliminated; it is believed that this operation was the cause of the original weld defect. Also, timing of plug mast movement was found to correspond with weld irregularities. The timing of the movement was changed to occur during weld head travel between tacks. In the end a three sequential tack weld process followed by a pulse weld at the same current and travel speed as was used for the legacy processes was suggested for use during the IC qualification effort. Relative to legacy welds, the PDC IC weld demonstrates greater fluctuation in the region of the weld located between tack welds. However, canister weld response (canister to canister) is consistent and with the aid of the optical mapping system (for targeting the <b>cut</b> <b>position)</b> is considered adequate. DR measurements and METs show the PDC IC welds to have sufficient ligament length to ensure adequate canister pressure/impact capacity and to ensure adequate stub function. The PDC welding process has not been optimized {{as a result of this}} effort. Differences remain between the legacy BTC welds and the PDC IC weld, but these differences are not sufficient to prevent resumption of the current PDC IC qualification effort. During the PDC IC qualification effort, a total of 17 cans will be welded and a variety of tests/inspections will be performed. The extensive data collected during that qualification effort should be of a sufficient population to determine if additional weld process optimization is necessary prior to production release...|$|E
