The Czechs and Poles collaborated on resisting Germanization movements, but this collaboration ceased after World War I. In 1920 the region of Zaolzie was incorporated into Czechoslovakia after the Polish–Czechoslovak War. Since then the Polish population demographically decreased. In 1938 it was annexed by Poland in the context of the Munich Agreement and in 1939 by Nazi Germany. The region was then given back to Czechoslovakia after World War II.

25|$|After World War II, a {{political}} monopoly {{was held by}} the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Czechoslovakia</b> (KSČ). Gustáv Husák was elected first secretary of the KSČ in 1969 (changed to general secretary in 1971) and president of Czechoslovakia in 1975. Other parties and organizations existed but functioned in subordinate roles to the KSČ. All political parties, as well as numerous mass organizations, were grouped under umbrella of the National Front. Human rights activists and religious activists were severely repressed.|$|E

25|$|Slovak {{autonomy}} was constrained; the Communist Party of Slovakia (KSS) was {{reunited with}} the KSČ (<b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Czechoslovakia),</b> but retained its own identity. Following the Soviet example, Czechoslovakia began emphasizing the rapid development of heavy industry. Although Czechoslovakia's industrial growth of 170 percent between 1948 and 1957 was impressive, {{it was far}} exceeded by that of Japan (300 percent) and the Federal Republic of Germany (almost 300 percent) and more than equaled by Austria and Greece.|$|E
25|$|Additional headway {{was made}} in Czechoslovakia, where a {{majority}} of trade union members similarly affiliated with RILU, following a campaign of expulsions of Communist individuals and unions by the Social Democratic leadership. In October 1922 the Czech Red unions held a congress of their own, formalizing the split with the Social Democratic unions. It is worthy of mention that the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Czechoslovakia</b> was an extremely large organization in this period, claiming 170,000 members in 1922, dwarfing {{all but a few}} Communist parties around the world.|$|E

The programme was produced clandestinely by former partisans who had fled to Czechoslovakia in order to escape prosecution during the 'trial of the Resistance' (processo alla Resistenza). 'Oggi in Italia' was a central element in the PCI's media strategy, particularly during the Cold War, when access to the official airwaves was circumscribed. The programme was thus {{a key element of}} the long-term legacy of the Resistance movement, but also played a highly significant role in the wider process of negotiation between the <b>Communist</b> <b>parties</b> <b>of</b> Italy, <b>Czechoslovakia</b> and the Soviet Union...|$|R

The centre of the thesis lies in its second part which deals with the situation and position of women in the public and political offices at the end of the 1960 's.

The main direction of the thesis is the attitudes of women to the august occupation <b>of</b> the <b>Czechoslovakia</b> 1968 by the troops of the Warsaw Treaty and their activity in those days. It follows also their previous careers and political activism and the implications of their august activity for their further careers and political path.

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of World War II, the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Czechoslovakia</b> (KSČ) was in a favourable position. Its powerful influence on Czechoslovak politics since the 1920s, its clean wartime record and cooperation with non-Communist parties, its identification with the Soviet Union, one of the country's liberators, and its determination to become the country's leading political force without alarming the West (a strategy followed too by Communist parties in Italy and France) dovetailed with popular opposition to Nazi rule, the longing for real change that followed it, and the new political realities of living within the Soviet orbit to produce a surge in membership from 40,000 in 1945 to 1.35 million in 1948.|$|E
40|$|Focusing on {{the state-run}} system of {{architectural}} offices {{as a mediator}} between politics and practice, this article considers how the 1948 <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> takeover <b>of</b> <b>Czechoslovakia</b> affected architectural practice {{and the establishment of}} housing types in the early 1950 s. The legacy of a strong local construction industry before 1948 was critical to these developments. At the new Institute of Prefabricated Buildings, created in 1952, architects and engineers continued earlier research on prefabricated construction technologies. Through this work, the Czechoslovak government and its architectural administration soon concluded that its best long-term option for solving the country 2 ̆ 7 s housing crisis was the use of structural panel construction. Fifty years later, one in three Czechs still lives in the more than one million apartments built with this technology between 1954 and 1990. Structural panel construction was not a Soviet import; instead it developed out of local wartime experimentation at the Bat 2 ̆ 7 a Shoe Company in Zlín, independently of similar research undertaken in the Soviet Union {{and other parts of the}} Eastern Bloc in the same years. Although buildings that look similar were constructed in the region and similar housing types appeared across Europe after the Second World War, this article argues that structural panel technology in Czechoslovakia is an example of local continuities in the building industry, rather than evidence of the homogenization of the postwar European landscape...|$|R

First he was quite orthodox Marxian economist, but after he was appointed as the Director of the Economic Institute of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, he started to be critical of the Stalinist system and eventually became a head of the movement for the economic reform of 1960 's. After the Soviet Invasion <b>of</b> <b>Czechoslovakia</b> in 1968 he emmigrated from Czechoslovakia and became a professor of economics in Switzerland. There he was more and more critical of the Soviet version of centrally planned socialism, but never fully accepted a free-market capitalism.
