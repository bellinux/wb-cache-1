25|$|Tooth {{whitening}} or tooth bleaching procedures {{attempt to}} lighten a tooth's color {{in either of}} two ways: by chemical or mechanical action. Working chemically, a bleaching agent is used to carry out an oxidation reaction in the enamel and dentin. The agents most commonly used to intrinsically change the color of teeth are hydrogen peroxide and <b>carbamide</b> peroxide. Oxygen radicals from the peroxide in the whitening agents contact the stains in the interprismatic spaces within the enamel layer. When this occurs, stains will be bleached and the teeth now appear lighter in color. Teeth not only appear whiter but also reflect light in increased amounts, which makes the teeth appear brighter as well. Studies show that whitening does not produce any ultrastructural or microhardness changes in the dental tissues.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{the nineteenth}} century, chemists {{generally}} believed that compounds obtained from living organisms were endowed with a vital force that distinguished them from inorganic compounds. According {{to the concept}} of vitalism (vital force theory), organic matter was endowed with a [...] "vital force". [...] During {{the first half of the}} nineteenth century, [...] some of the first systematic studies of organic compounds were reported. Around 1816 Michel Chevreul started a study of soaps made from various fats and alkalis. He separated the different acids that, in combination with the alkali, produced the soap. [...] Since these were all individual compounds, he demonstrated that it was possible to make a chemical change in various fats (which traditionally come from [...] organic sources), producing new compounds, without [...] "vital force". In 1828 Friedrich Wöhler produced the organic chemical urea (<b>carbamide),</b> a constituent of urine, from inorganic starting materials (the salts potassium cyanate and ammonium sulfate), in what is now called the Wöhler synthesis. [...] Although Wöhler [...] himself was cautious about claiming he had disproved vitalism, this was the first time a substance thought to be organic was synthesized in the laboratory without biological (organic) starting materials. The event is now generally accepted as indeed disproving the doctrine of vitalism.|$|E

40|$|Stroke is the 3 rd {{leading cause}} of death in the United States. For this reason, it has become our goal to find a drug that is capable of reestablishing {{intracellular}} and extracellular Ca+ 2 flux upon direct binding to the sigma receptor, which can be delivered easily and efficiently. Our active research focuses the development of guanidine analogues that can serve as therapeutic drugs which target sigma 1 and sigma 2 receptors having a direct effect on Ca+ 2 levels on the cell. The use of symmetrical guanidine analogues such as N,N 2 ̆ 7 -di-o-tolyl guanidine (o-DTG) as therapeutic drugs for ischemic stroke, is promising {{due to the fact that}} neuronal cells can restore the proper blood flow and block Ca+ 2 flux into the cell. Our main objective is to be able to develop a cost efficient, mild reaction methodology that affords access to guanidine analogues. The synthetic design of the guanidine analogues has been accomplished using copper-catalyzed cross-coupling diarylation reaction. This methodology employs a non-expensive guanidine salt and substituted aryl iodides along with N,N 2 ̆ 7 -diethylsalicylamides as the key ligand in this strategy. Similar methodology was employed for the synthesis of monoarylated amidines employing ligand-free conditions for the copper-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction. Moreover, efforts to find alternative methodologies to access other sigma receptor ligands were accomplished. A new method to create N,N 2 ̆ 7 -disubstituted <b>carbamides</b> employed HATU as a peptide coupling agent allowing for the formation of <b>carbamides</b> using the inexpensive guanidine nitrate and carboxylic acids as starting materials. Studies on the sigma response of the cortical neuron cell were conducted upon completion of the analogue design.

40|$|The recent {{breakthrough}} {{discoveries of}} transport systems assigned with atypical functions {{provide evidence for}} complexity in membrane transport biochemistry. Some channels are far from being simple pores creating hydrophilic passages for solutes and can, unexpectedly, act as enzymes, or mediate high-affinity uptake, and some transporters are surprisingly able to function as sensors, channels or even enzymes. Furthermore, numerous transport studies have demonstrated complex multiphasic uptake kinetics for organic and mineral nutrients The biphasic kinetics of glucose uptake in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a result of several genetically distinct uptake systems operating simultaneously, is a classical example that is a subject of continuous debate In contrast, some transporters display biphasic kinetics, being bona fidae dual-affinity transporters, their kinetic properties often modulated by post-translational regulation Also. aquaporins have recently been reported to exhibit diverse transport properties and can behave as highly adapted, multifunctional channels, transporting solutes such as CO 2, hydrogen peroxide, urea, ammonia, glycerol. polyols, <b>carbamides,</b> purines and pyrimidines, metalloids. glycine, and lactic acid, rather than being simple water pores The present review provides an overview on some atypical functions displayed by transporter proteins and discusses how this novel knowledge on cellular uptake systems {{may be related to}} complex multiphasic uptake kinetics often seen {{in a wide variety of}} living organisms and the intriguing diffusive uptake of sugars and other solutes (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AQP 9 is constitutively expressed at high levels in the liver. In the brain under physiological conditions, AQP 9 was first observed in tanycytes, and then in astrocytes. Only recently, its expression was also shown in neurons. Neurons expressing AQP 9 are catecholaminergic and glucose sensitive. The expression of neuronal AQP 9 can be negatively regulated by insulin and in diabetic animals an increase in AQP 9 expression is observed in the catecholaminergic nuclei of the hindbrain, similar to the regulation of AQP 9 by insulin in the liver. Furthermore, after transient brain ischemia, AQP 9 expression is increased in astrocytes and its regulation may implicate the MAP-kinase pathways stimulated in such pathological conditions. Despite these new data, the exact role of AQP 9 in the brain is still unclear. However, we may hypothesize that AQP 9 is implicated in brain energy metabolism, as a neutral solute channel. AQP 9 could facilitate the diffusion of lactate from the astrocyte to the neuron. In glucose sensitive neurons, diffusion of lactate and glycerol could stimulate these neurons in a similar manner to glucose and could regulate the energy balance. In pathological conditions, induction of AQP 9 in astrocytes could participate in the clearance of excess lactate in the extracellular space. These hypotheses concerning the function of brain AQP 9 are still speculative and open new areas of investigation...|$|R
