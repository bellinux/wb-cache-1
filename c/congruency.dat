Although their study was unable to find enough evidence to support their hypothesis they agree that school belonging will influence emotional behavioral problems. According to other studies, TCKs are proven to have less emotional stability than those who grew up in more culturally and socially stable environment.|$|E

All algorithms solving this task have their bottlenecks in calculating modular reduction as they need to divide. The problem with division or floating point remainder instruction is that these instructions have high latencies and are not pipelined. This paper compares several approaches {{that can be used to}} perform modular reduction after multiplication in integer and floating point arithmetic and its purpose is to offer a highly system optimized algorithm for modular multiplication with reduction using SIMD processor extensions...|$|R

According to one view, the SNARC effect arises at an early processing stage due to (in) <b>congruencies</b> between the digit's side of presentation and its representation on the mental number line, independently of response effector(s). Alternatively, the SNARC effect might arise at a later response-related stage due to (in) <b>congruencies</b> between the digit's representation on the mental number line and the side of response, independently {{of the side of}} presentation. The results of three experiments, using central and lateralized stimuli, and vocal and manual responses, clearly support the view that the SNARC effect arises at a relatively late response-related stage, without substantive contributions from earlier processing stages...|$|R

The prime number 11 and any other higher prime number can not lead to any perception of <b>congruency,</b> as the inner ear separates only the first eight to ten partials. The eleventh partial may be audible and discriminable from the tenth or twelfth partial if isolated via techniques such as flageolet. If presented {{as part of a}} complex tone comprising also the adjoining partials these partials would fuse together, and a <b>congruency</b> with the partial of another note could no longer be detected. It might be interesting to test whether it is possible to detect harmonic <b>congruency</b> for higher prime numbers for instruments with odd partials, as the distances between partials are higher in these instruments.

40|$|International audienceThe {{analyses}} of <b>congruencies</b> among biodiversity components {{address the issue}} of conservation priorities, but previously they have been done at coarse scales with limited relevance for conservation actions. Moreover, these former studies consider only the species level components of biodiversity and not the intra-specific evolutionary legacy that influences future biodiversity. This study represents the first assessment of <b>congruencies</b> between various components of plant biodiversity and the evolutionary legacy of a narrow endemic taxon (Arenaria provincialis, Caryophyllaceae). Assessment is conducted in the vicinity of a Mediterranean big city (Marseille, S. E. France) where habitats and flora are threatened by mass tourism and urban sprawl. Our analyses reveal that the different plant biodiversity facets assessed are spatially mismatched and unequally protected. Moreover, by using only species-level components of biodiversity as conservation targets we ignore crucial areas for the evolutionary legacy of this narrow endemic plant. Our results highlight the crucial role of phylogeography as a criterion to target the genetic precursors of future biodiversity in conservation planning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper focuses on the experience with mobile technology in an inherently mobile and information intensive work activity - policing. Drawing upon data from this context this paper makes two key sets of contributions. Empirically, we illuminate the <b>congruencies</b> and contradictions between mobile {{technology and}} mobile working, and the relationship between the two, revealing a state of change based upon dialectic interaction. We highlight several ways in which mobile technology has changed the nature of mobile work activity. Theoretically we advance the use of activity theory to better understand the changes of mobile technology mediated work. We extend traditional use of activity theory by adopting <b>congruencies</b> as an analytical lens, in addition to the approach of examining contradictions. The findings are applicable to other areas of mobile work and contribute to the body of knowledge concerning mobile technology mediated work...|$|R

Theresearch was conducted in a higher education institution with an international academic information system as itsobject of analysis.

Methodologically, this study is characterized by epistemological suppositions supported by an interpretativeperspective and a qualitative approach. In-depth interviews, participant observation, document analysis andphysical artifacts were the sources of empirical data. Data analysis and interpretation were backed up by adialectic-hermeneutic method. The results point to different interpretations of the academic information system. These interpretations are socially constructed by the individuals and become greatly affected by their priorknowledge of the system, their assumptions and expectations towards it. Personal and contextual characteristicsas well as technological ones are integrated creating, reinforcing and modifying <b>congruencies</b> andincongruencies in technological frames...|$|R
