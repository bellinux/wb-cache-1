40|$|The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 {{established}} the Renewable Fuels Standard which set forth goals for domestic {{renewable fuel production}} of <b>cellulosic</b> and advanced <b>biofuels</b> in the United States.

Energy cane has been identified as a crop with having significant potential to be developed as a biofuel feedstock crop. The greatest challenge currently facing the production of energy cane is the ability to expand production of the crop outside temperate zones. Within the six-state study area, approximately 1. 15 million hectares were identified as idle cropland having the greatest potential for energy cane production.

40|$|Despite market-based {{incentives}} and mandated production, the U. S. <b>cellulosic</b> <b>biofuel</b> {{industry has been}} slow to develop. This dissertation explores the economic factors that have limited industry development along with important economic tradeoffs that will be encountered with commercial-scale production. The first essay provides an overview of the policies, potential, and challenges of the biofuel industry, with a focus on <b>cellulosic</b> <b>biofuel.</b> The second essay considers the economics of <b>cellulosic</b> <b>biofuel</b> production. Breakeven models of the local feedstock supply system and biofuel refining process are constructed to develop the Biofuel Breakeven (BioBreak) program, a stochastic, Excel-based program that evaluates the feasibility of local biofuel and biomass markets under various policy and market scenarios. An application of the BioBreak program is presented using expected market conditions for 14 local <b>cellulosic</b> <b>biofuel</b> markets that vary by feedstock and location. The economic costs of biofuel production identified from the BioBreak application are higher than frequently anticipated and raise questions about the potential of cellulosic ethanol as a sustainable and economical substitute for conventional fuels. Program results also are extended using life-cycle analysis to evaluate the cost of reducing GHG emissions by substituting cellulosic ethanol for conventional fuel. The third essay takes {{a closer look at the}} economic trade-offs within the biorefinery industry and feedstock production processes. A long-run biomass production through bioenergy conversion cost model is developed that incorporates heterogeneity of biomass suppliers within and between local markets. The model builds on previous literature by treating biomass as a non-commoditized feedstock and relaxes the common assumption of fixed biomass density and price within local markets. An empirical application is provided for switchgrass-based ethanol production within U. S. crop reporting districts (CRDs). Incorporating location-specific biomass supply conditions creates unique and important economic tradeoffs within each CRD that have important impacts on the potential supply and distribution of U.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} include: 1) developing an economic framework to estimate long run equilibrium breakeven prices that cellulosic ethanol processors can pay for the marginal or last unit of biomass feedstock they purchase and still breakeven and that cellulosic feedstock producers need to receive for supplying the last unit of feedstock delivered to a commercial-scale plant; 2) estimating the gap or difference between the biorefinery’s willingness to pay (WTP) or derived demand for the last unit of cellulosic feedstock and the suppliers’ willingness to accept (WTA) or marginal cost (MC) of supplying the last unit of feedstock; 3) completing a life-cycle analysis (LCA) of each feedstock alternative or a “well-to-wheels” accounting of the potential greenhouse gas (GHG) savings associated with feedstock-specific ethanol relative to gasoline; and 4) calculating the carbon price or credit necessary for a biofuel market {{to exist in the}} long run.
