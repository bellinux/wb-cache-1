50|$|Ignition {{takes place}} with {{individual}} ignition coils {{placed on the}} respective spark plug. The spark plugs, together with the ignition coils and combustion detection module (CDM), are used to detect combustion and possible knocking. This means {{there is no need}} for a <b>camshaft</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> or separate knock sensor.|$|E
5000|$|Common {{mounting}} locations {{include the}} main crank pulley, the flywheel, the camshaft {{or on the}} crankshaft itself. This sensor is the 2nd most important sensor in modern-day engines after the <b>camshaft</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor.</b> When it fails, there is a probability the engine will not start, or cut out while running.|$|E
50|$|The {{cylinder}} block was redesigned {{for use with}} a balance shaft. Cylinder heads (10238181 casting) used with the L35 will have intake ports with eyebrows that clear the fuel injectors. Timing cover flange area was thickened in 1995 {{when some of the}} balance shaft motors had a 6 bolt timing cover - some engines had a crankshaft position sensor (in conjunction with a redesigned distributor containing a pickup assembly which functions as a <b>camshaft</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor)</b> when OBDII was phased in.|$|E
50|$|The four {{camshafts}} incorporate VCT (variable camshaft timing). VCT {{allows the}} timing of the intake and exhaust valves to be adjusted independently of each other. The VCT system is controlled by the Bosch ECM (engine control module) using information from CMP (<b>camshaft</b> <b>position)</b> <b>sensors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Commonly used in {{distributors}} for {{ignition timing}} (and in {{some types of}} crank and <b>camshaft</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensors</b> for injection pulse timing, speed sensing, etc.) the Hall effect sensor {{is used as a}} direct replacement for the mechanical breaker points used in earlier automotive applications. Its use as an ignition timing device in various distributor types is as follows. A stationary permanent magnet and semiconductor Hall effect chip are mounted next to each other separated by an air gap, forming the Hall effect sensor. A metal rotor consisting of windows and tabs is mounted to a shaft and arranged so that during shaft rotation, the windows and tabs pass through the air gap between the permanent magnet and semiconductor Hall chip. This effectively shields and exposes the Hall chip to the permanent magnet's field respective to whether a tab or window is passing though the Hall sensor. For ignition timing purposes, the metal rotor will have a number of equal-sized tabs and windows matching the number of engine cylinders. This produces a uniform square wave output since the on/off (shielding and exposure) time is equal. This signal is used by the engine computer or ECU to control ignition timing. Many automotive Hall effect sensors have a built-in internal NPN transistor with an open collector and grounded emitter, meaning that rather than a voltage being produced at the Hall sensor signal output wire, the transistor is turned on providing a circuit to ground through the signal output wire.|$|R
5000|$|Data {{representing}} {{the amount of}} power output desired by the driver (sometimes known as [...] "engine load") is also used by the engine control unit in calculating the amount of fuel required. A throttle <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> (TPS) provides this information. Other engine sensors used in EFI systems include a coolant temperature sensor, a <b>camshaft</b> or crankshaft <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> (some systems get the position information from the distributor), and an oxygen sensor which is installed in the exhaust system {{so that it can}} be used to determine how well the fuel has been combusted, therefore allowing closed loop operation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{crank sensor}} {{can be used}} in {{combination}} with a similar <b>camshaft</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> to monitor the relationship between the pistons and valves in the engine, which is particularly important in engines with variable valve timing. This method is also used to [...] "synchronise" [...] a four stroke engine upon starting, allowing the management system to know when to inject the fuel. It is also commonly used as the primary source for the measurement of engine speed in revolutions per minute.|$|E
50|$|The {{most notable}} {{change of the}} RC45 when {{released}} {{was the use of}} Programmed Fuel Injection. Fuel injection had been used on bikes previously but these had either been rather antiquated analog computers or very simple digital units with a minimal number of sensors for input, which resulted in very crude fueling. The RC30 had used 38 mm constant velocity carburettors which, for road use are quite nice, maintaining a high air velocity across a wide rpm range, though were not as well suited for racing. The RC45 did away with carburetors and in their absence a brace of four 46 mm throttles were replaced, Honda now had the throttle area it needed to make big horsepower at high revolutions. The system Honda used on the RC45 was very similar to the system used on the NR750. Contrary to popular belief the RC45’s fuel injection is not like a 4-stage carburetor, rather it is a proper fuel only system. Honda kept the ignition system separate. The Honda system obtained information from the following sensors: crankshaft position sensor, <b>camshaft</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor,</b> air temperature sensor, coolant temperature sensor, manifold absolute pressure sensor, throttle position sensor, barometric sensor and battery voltage. With all of these sensors relaying information to the ECU, Honda could have quite easily incorporated the ignition control unit. The reason that they had not came down to the supplier of parts: they had different manufacturers supplying the ecu and cdi units. Regardless, it allowed the use of very large throttle plates seamlessly over a very wide engine operating range. The engine of the RC45 also used many magnesium castings, as of rather recently, it has become quite common to see fuel injection and magnesium engine parts on motorcycles, though in the early-to-mid 1990’s this was expensive and incredibly innovative.|$|E
50|$|The Trionic system lacks a <b>camshaft</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor.</b> This sensor is {{normally}} {{a prerequisite for}} a sequential pre ignition/pinging regulation and fuel injection. Saab Trionic must decide whether cylinder one or cylinder four ignites when the crank shaft position sensor indicates that cylinder one and four is at TDC. This is done by help of ionization current. One of the poles of the secondary coil of the spark coils {{is connected to the}} spark plugs in an ordinary manner. The other pole isn’t grounded directly but connected to an 80 V voltage. This means that an 80 V voltage is applied across the spark gap of the spark plugs, except when the spark is fired. When combustion has occurred the temperature in the combustion chamber is very high. The gases are formed as ions and start to conduct electric current. This results in a current flowing in the spark plug gap (without resulting in a spark). The ionisation current is measured in pairs, cylinder one and two is one pair and cylinder three and four in the other pair. If combustion occurs in cylinder one or two the ignition cassette sends battery voltage (B+) pulse to the ECU, pin 17. If the combustion takes place in cylinder three or four the B+ pulse is fed to pin 18 in ECU. If the crankshaft position sensor indicates that cylinders one and four are at TDC and a B+ pulse enters the ECU via pin 17 simultaneously, then the ECU know that it is cylinder one that has ignited. Upon starting, the ECU doesn’t know which cylinder is in compression phase, hence ignition is initiated in both cylinders one and four and 180 crank shaft degrees later sparks in cylinder two and three are fired. As soon as the combustion signals enters the ECU via pin 17 and pin 18 the ignition and fuel injection is synchronised to the engines firing order. The combustion signals are also used to detect misfires.|$|E
50|$|Engine bore, {{stroke and}} redline {{remained}} unchanged; {{everything else was}} completely new. The clutch was changed from hydraulic to cable-operated. The generator was moved from behind the cylinder to the more conventional location at the left end of the crank. There was now no balance shaft. The valvetrain switched to direct valve actuation, and the cylinder head was plumbed for then-new plug-top ignition coils, replacing more conventional remote coils and high-tension leads. Notably, the new engine also featured a Hall-type cam <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> on the exhaust <b>camshaft.</b> Cam <b>position</b> <b>sensors</b> are typically {{used in conjunction with}} electronic fuel injection. As the ZX900C featured induction by Keihin 40 mm CVKD carburettors, a cam <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> wasn't necessary. Its inclusion could indicate that Kawasaki had designs to include fuel injection on the engine in the future. This first happened on the 2000 ZX-12R Kawasaki's first fuel-injected sport bike since the 1981-1985 GPZ1100.But this did not happen on this engine until the 2003 introduction of the Z1000, which uses a bored-out ex-ZX-9R engine.|$|R

40|$|An {{electronic}} <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> for {{use with}} a power operated vehicle accessory, such as a power liftgate. The <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> includes an elongated resistive circuit that is mounted such that it is stationary and extends along {{the path of a}} track portion of the power operated accessory. The <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> further includes a contact nub mounted to a link member that moves within the track portion such that the contact nub is slidingly biased against the elongated circuit. As the link member moves under the force of a motor-driven output gear, the contact nub slides along the surface of the resistive circuit, thereby affecting the overall resistance of the circuit. The <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> uses the overall resistance to provide an electronic position signal to an ECU, wherein the signal is indicative of the absolute position of the power operated accessory. Accordingly, the electronic <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> is capable of providing an electronic signal that enables the ECU to track the absolute position of the power operated accessory...|$|R
