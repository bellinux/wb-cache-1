40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{examined}} the procedural and 30 -day clinical outcomes among patients receiving aspirin and either ticlopidine or clopidogrel during coronary stenting. BACKGROUNDTiclopidine-plus-aspirin has become standard antiplatelet therapy {{for the prevention}} of thrombotic complications after coronary stenting. Clopidogrel has a similar mechanism of action as ticlopidine, but both its efficacy and its safety as a pharmacologic adjunct to coronary stenting have not been well described. METHODSThis single-center, prospective analysis {{examined the}} in-hospital procedural and 30 -day clinical outcomes among 875 consecutive patients undergoing coronary stenting who received adjunctive aspirin and either <b>clopidogrel</b> (<b>n</b> = 514; 58. 7 %) or ticlopidine (n = 361; 41. 3 %) therapy. RESULTSProcedural success rates were similar among the clopidogrel- (99. 6 %) and ticlopidine-treated patients (99. 4 %). Subacute stent thrombosis (i. e., > 24 h ≤ 30 days) occurred in one clopidogrel-treated (0. 2 %) and in one ticlopidine-treated (0. 3 %) patient (p = 0. 99). By 30 days following the index procedure, the combined rates of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and need for target vessel revascularization were similar among patients who received either clopidogrel (2. 1 %) or ticlopidine (1. 4 %; p = 0. 57) therapy. CONCLUSIONSIn this analysis the antiplatelet combination therapy of aspirin-plus-clopidogrel was an effective regimen for preventing thrombotic complications and major adverse cardiovascular events among a broad spectrum of patients undergoing coronary artery stenting...|$|E
40|$|Aim This {{prospective}} {{cohort study}} investigated whether {{the use of}} preoperative anticoagulants is an independent risk factor for the outcomes of surgical treatment of patients with a neck of femur fracture. Methods Data was obtained from a prospectively collected database. All patients admitted for a neck of femur fracture between Nov 2010 and Oct 2011 were included. This resulted in three hundred twenty-eight patients with 330 neck of femur fractures. Four groups were defined; patients preoperatively (i) on aspirin (n = 105); (ii) on <b>clopidogrel</b> (<b>n</b> = 28); (iii) on warfarin (n = 30), and; (iv) without any anticoagulation history (n = 167, the control group). The non-warfarin group included the aspirin group, clopidogrel group and the control group. Primary outcome was the in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were the postoperative complications, return to theatre and length of stay. Results Thirteen in-hospital deaths were identified, 4 deaths in the aspirin group, 1 death in the clopidogrel group, 2 deaths in the warfarin group and 6 deaths in the control group. No {{significant difference in the}} mortality rates was found between the different groups. Also in the secondary outcomes, no significant difference was found between the four groups. A trend to a higher wound complication rate for the warfarin group was detected.

We investigated whether H- 2 -receptor antagonist (H(2) RA) is an alternative to PPI in patients with ACS. METHODS: We conducted a population- based retrospective cohort study of 6552 patients in Taiwan discharged for ACS between 2002 and 2005. Patients were divided into 5 cohorts: clopidogrel plus H 2 RA (<b>n</b> = 252), <b>clopidogrel</b> plus PPI (<b>n</b> = 311), <b>clopidogrel</b> alone (<b>n</b> = 5551), H(2) RA alone (n = 235), and PPI alone (n = 203). The primary outcome was rehospitalization for ACS or all-cause mortality within 3 month of rehospitalization. RESULTS: The 1 -year cumulative incidence of the primary outcome was 26. 8 % (95 % CI: 21. 5 %- 33. 0 %) in the clopidogrel plus H(2) RA cohort and 33. 2 % (95 % CI: 27. 8 %- 39. 4 %) in the clopidogrel plus PPI cohort, compared with 11. 6 % (95 % CI: 10. 8 %- 12. 5 %) in the clopidogrel alone cohort (P <. 0001). No significant difference was observed between the PPI alone cohort (11. 0 %; 95 % CI: 7. 1 %- 16. 8 %), the H(2) RA alone cohort (11. 8 %; 95 % CI: 8. 2 %- 16. 8 %), and the clopidogrel alone cohort {{in terms of the}} primary outcome. The number needed to harm was 7 with concomitant H(2) RA and 5 with concomitant PPI. On multivariate analysis, concomitant H(2) RA and PPI were independent risk factors predicting adverse outcomes (adjusted hazard ratios, 2. 48 and 3. 20, respectively; P <. 0001).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{prevalence}} of ex vivo high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR) to commonly prescribed antiplatelet regimens after transient ischemic attack (TIA) or ischemic stroke is uncertain. METHODS: Platelet function inhibition was simultaneously assessed with modified light transmission aggregometry (VerifyNow; Accumetrics Inc, San Diego, CA) {{and with a}} moderately high shear stress platelet function analyzer (PFA- 100; Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc, Malvern, PA) in a pilot, cross-sectional study of TIA or ischemic stroke patients. Patients were assessed on aspirin-dipyridamole combination therapy (n = 51) or <b>clopidogrel</b> monotherapy (<b>n</b> = 25). RESULTS: On the VerifyNow, HTPR on aspirin was identified in 4 of 51 patients (8 %) on aspirin-dipyridamole combination therapy (≥ 550 aspirin reaction units on the aspirin cartridge). Eleven of 25 (44 %) patients had HTPR on clopidogrel (≥ 194 P 2 Y 12 reaction units on the P 2 Y 12 cartridge). On the PFA- 100, 21 of 51 patients (41 %) on aspirin-dipyridamole combination therapy had HTPR on the collagen-epinephrine (C-EPI) cartridge. Twenty-three of 25 patients (92 %) on clopidogrel had HTPR on the collagen-adenosine diphosphate (C-ADP) cartridge. The proportion of patients with antiplatelet HTPR was lower on the VerifyNow than PFA- 100 in patients on both regimens (P <. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The {{prevalence of}} ex vivo antiplatelet HTPR after TIA or ischemic stroke is markedly influenced by the method used to assess platelet reactivity. The PFA- 100 C-ADP cartridge is not sensitive at detecting the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel ex vivo. Larger prospective studies with the VerifyNow and with the PFA- 100 C-EPI and recently released Innovance PFA P 2 Y cartridges (Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc) in addition to newer tests of platelet function are warranted to assess whether platelet function monitoring predicts clinical outcome in ischemic cerebrovascular disease...|$|R
40|$|Background: Until {{now there}} has been scarce {{evidence}} regarding an optimal antiplatelet strategy and clinical outcomes for patients who had suffered from stent thrombosis (ST). Methods and Results: 140 patients who suffered from stent thrombosis were prospectively registered. Patients received dual (aspirin and 150 mg <b>clopidogrel,</b> <b>N</b> = 66) or triple (additional cilostazol, N = 74) antiplatelet therapy at the physician’s discretion. Thereafter platelet reactivity and one year clinical outcomes were analyzed. The primary outcome included the composite of cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke at one year,which developed in 41 (29. 3 %) patients, consisting of 31 (22. 1 %) cardiac death, 9 (6. 4 %) non-fatal MI and 1 (1. 4 %) stroke. Recurrent definite and probable ST according to ARC definition was observed in 8 (5. 7 %) and 14 (10. 0 %) patients, respectively. Triple therapy was associated with significantly lower platelet reactivities (50. 2617. 8, % vs. 59. 6617. 2, %, P = 0. 002) compared to high dose dual antiplatelet therapy. However, the incidence of primary events (24. 3 % vs. 34. 8 %, P = 0. 172) did not differ between triple and dual antiplatelet therapies. High on-treatment platelet reactivity (HR: 8. 35, 95 % CI: 2. 234, 30. 867, P = 0. 002) and diabetes (HR: 3. 732, 95 % CI: 1. 353, 10. 298, P = 0. 011) were independent predictors of primary events.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Poor {{response}} to both aspirin and clopidogrel (dual poor responsiveness [DPR]) {{is a major}} risk factor for recurrent ischemic events. OBJECTIVES: The {{aim of this study}} was to identify factors associated with DPR, defined with specific tests, and derive a predictive clinical score. METHODS: We studied 771 consecutive stable cardiovascular patients treated with aspirin (n = 223), <b>clopidogrel</b> (<b>n</b> = 111), or both drugs (n = 37). Aspirin responsiveness was evaluated by serum thromboxane (Tx) B assay, and clopidogrel responsiveness by calculating the platelet reactivity index (PRI) on the basis of the phosphorylation status of the vasodilator phosphoprotein. The analysis was focused on patients treated with both drugs, and on independent predictors of DPR. RESULTS: Among patients on dual therapy, there was no relevant correlation between TxB levels and PRI values (r = 0. 11). Sixty-seven patients (15. 4 %) had DPR. Diabetes [odds ratio (OR) 1. 89, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 06 - 3. 39], high body weight (> 86 kg vs. /= 160 mg, OR 0. 12, 95 % CI 0. 09 - 0. 93) and high C-reactive protein (CRP) level (> 1. 6 mg L(1) vs. < 0. 6 mg L(1), OR 3. 66, 95 % CI 1. 74 - 8. 72) were independently associated with DPR, via increased TxB(2) levels, increased PRI, or both. These associations with TxB and PRI were reproduced across the whole population. With use of a factor-weighed score (c-index = 0. 74), the predicted prevalence of DPR was 57 % in the highest strata of the score as compared with < 4 % for the lowest strata. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes, body weight, the aspirin dose and CRP levels are readily available independent predictors of DPR, and some are potential targets for reducing its prevalence...|$|E

We wished to study clinical outcomes in a large real-world population post-ACS. Methods and results We performed a prospective cohort study in 45 073 ACS patients enrolled into SwedishWeb system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies who were discharged on ticagrelor (N = 11 954) or <b>clopidogrel</b> (<b>N</b> = 33 119) between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2013. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death, re-admission with myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke, secondary outcomes as the individual components of the primary outcome, and re-admission with bleeding. The risk of the primary outcome with ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel was 11. 7 vs. 22. 3 % (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0. 85 [95 % confidence interval: 0. 78 - 0. 93]), risk of death 5. 8 vs. 12. 9 % (adjusted HR 0. 83 [0. 75 - 0. 92]), and risk of MI 6. 1 vs. 10. 8 % (adjusted HR 0. 89 [0. 78 - 1. 01]) at 24 months. Re-admission with bleeding with ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel occurred in 5. 5 vs. 5. 2 % (adjusted HR 1. 20 [1. 04 - 1. 40]). In a subset of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel the PCI-related in-hospital bleeding was 3. 7 vs. 2. 7 % (adjusted odds ratio, OR, 1. 57 [1. 30 - 1. 90]).

40|$|Background: Ontop of aspirin, an {{abciximab}} bolusonly regimen {{results in}} a 30 % drop in platelet inhibition at 6 h {{as compared with the}} on-label regimen. The concomitant administration of high loading dose clopidogrel, by bridging with abciximab bolus, may sustain suppression of platelet activity over time. Objectives: To investigate the non-inferiority of abciximab bolus-only and concomitant high loading dose clopidogrel vs. abciximab bolus + infusion with respect to the inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) as determined by light transmission aggregometry. Patients/Methods: Seventy-three patients with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndromes underwent double-blind randomization to abciximab bolus followed by a 12 -h placebo infusion and concomitant 600 - mg clopidogrel vs. abciximab bolus + a 12 -h infusion and 300 mg of clopidogrel. IPA was determined by light transmission aggregometry throughout 24 h. Clopidogrel poor responsiveness was defined as ‡ 50 % 5 lmol L) 1 ADP-induced maximum platelet aggregation. Results: In <b>clopidogrel</b> responders (<b>n</b> = 68), IPA after 20 lmol L) 1 ADP at 4 h was 89 % ± 13 % in the bolus-only arm vs. 92 % ± 14 % in the bolus + infusion arm (P = 0. 011 for non-inferiority). IPA after 5 or 20 lmol L) 1 ADP and 5 or 15 lmol L) 1 TRAP and the proportion of patients showing ‡ 80 % IPA did not differ at any time point, irrespective of clopidogrel responsiveness status. Thirty-day outcomes were similar, whereas hemoglobin (0. 91 ± 0. 8 vs. 0. 5 ± 0. 7 g dL) 1; P = 0. 01) and platelet count mean drop (41. 7 ± 57 vs. 18. 6 ± 34 109 L) 1; P = 0. 042) were significantly reduced in the bolus-only arm. Conclusions: Withholding abciximab post-bolus infusion in patients receiving high loading dose clopidogrel does not impair platelet inhibition throughout 24 h, and has the potential to improve the safety profile of the drug at reduced costs...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThis {{study was}} {{performed}} to compare the effects of antiplatelet regimens on early inflammation and cardiac marker release after elective stenting. BackgroundFew data exist regarding the comparative effects of specific antiplatelet regimens on early inflammation marker release after stenting. MethodsIn a 2 × 2 factorial randomized investigation, patients undergoing stenting were treated with either clopidogrel alone (300 mg or 600 mg; n = 60) or <b>clopidogrel</b> with eptifibatide (<b>n</b> = 60). Platelet aggregation (5 and 20 μM adenosine diphosphate [ADP]), ADP-stimulated expression of active glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa, and platelet-bound P-selectin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, C-reactive protein (CRP), and cardiac markers were measured. ResultsCompared with a strategy of clopidogrel alone, clopidogrel + eptifibatide reduced the release of cardiac markers. A marked reduction in platelet aggregation and active GP IIb/IIIa expression (p ≤ 0. 001) with clopidogrel + eptifibatide {{was associated with a}} decrease in CRP and TNF-α release (p ≤ 0. 001). ConclusionsA strategy of clopidogrel with GP IIb/IIIa blockade resulted in superior inhibition of inflammation and cardiac marker release, which was accompanied by superior platelet inhibition immediately after percutaneous coronary intervention compared with a strategy of clopidogrel alone.

We tested the hypothesis that clopidogrel is as effective as esomeprazole and aspirin in preventing recurrences of ulcer complications. Methods: This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled study of 170 patients who developed ulcer bleeding after the use of low-dose aspirin between November 2002 and January 2005. After healing of ulcers and eradication of Helicobacter pylori, if present, patients were assigned randomly to treatment with esomeprazole 20 mg/day and aspirin 100 mg/day (n = 86) or <b>clopidogrel</b> 75 mg/day (<b>n</b> = 84) for 52 weeks. The primary end point was recurrent ulcer complications. Results: During a median follow-up period of 52 weeks, no patient in the esomeprazole group, as compared with 9 patients in the clopidogrel group, developed recurrent ulcer complications. The cumulative incidences of recurrent ulcer complications were 0 % in patients receiving esomeprazole and aspirin and 13. 6 % in patients receiving clopidogrel (absolute difference, 13. 6 %; 95 % confidence interval for the difference, 6. 3 - 20. 9; log-rank test, P =. 0019).

40|$|AIMS: Excessive {{bleeding}} impairs outcome after {{coronary artery}} bypass grafting (CABG). Current guidelines recommend withdrawal of clopidogrel and ticagrelor 5 days (120 h) before elective surgery. Shorter discontinuation would {{reduce the risk of}} thrombotic events and save hospital resources, but may increase the risk of bleeding. We investigated whether a shorter discontinuation time before surgery increased the incidence of CABG-related major bleeding complications and compared ticagrelor- and clopidogrel-treated patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: All acute coronary syndrome patients in Sweden on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and ticagrelor (n = 1266) or <b>clopidogrel</b> (<b>n</b> = 978) who underwent CABG during 2012 - 13 were included in a retrospective observational study. The incidence of major bleeding complications according to the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium-CABG definition was 38 and 31 %, respectively, when ticagrelor/clopidogrel was discontinued 120 h before surgery [odds ratio (OR) 0. 93 (95 % confidence interval, CI, 0. 53 - 1. 64), P = 0. 80]. In contrast, clopidogrel-treated patients had a higher incidence when discontinued 72 - 120 vs. > 120 h before surgery (OR 1. 71 (95 % CI 1. 04 - 2. 79), P = 0. 033). The overall incidence of major bleeding complications was lower with ticagrelor [12. 9 vs. 17. 6 %, adjusted OR 0. 72 (95 % CI 0. 56 - 0. 92), P = 0. 012]. CONCLUSION: The incidence of CABG-related major bleeding was high when ticagrelor/clopidogrel was discontinued < 24 h before surgery. Discontinuation 3 days before surgery, as opposed to 5 days, did not increase the incidence of major bleeding complications with ticagrelor, but increased the risk with clopidogrel. The overall risk of major CABG-related bleeding complications was lower with ticagrelor than with clopidogrel.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{administration}} of antiplatelet drugs before {{coronary artery bypass}} graft surgery (CABG) is associated with an increased risk of major hemorrhage and related surgical reexploration. Little is known about the relative effect of combined clopidogrel and aspirin on blood product use around the time of CABG. We evaluated the associated risk between the combined use of aspirin and clopidogrel and the transfusion of blood products perioperatively. Methods We retrospectively studied a cohort of 659 individuals who underwent a first CABG, without concomitant valvular or aortic surgery, at a single large Canadian cardiac surgical centre between January 2000 and April 2002. The four study exposure groups were those prescribed aspirin (n = 105), <b>clopidogrel</b> (<b>n</b> = 11), the combination of both (n = 46), or neither drug (n = 497), within 7 days prior to CABG. The primary study outcome was the excessive transfusion of blood products during CABG and up to the second post-operative day, defined as ≥ 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC), ≥ 2 units of fresh frozen plasma, ≥ 5 units of cryoprecipitate or ≥ 5 units of platelets. Secondary outcomes included the mean number of transfused units of each type of blood product. Results A greater mean number of units of PRBC were transfused among those who received clopidogrel alone (2. 9) or in combination with aspirin (2. 4), compared to those on aspirin alone (1. 9) or neither antiplatelet drug (1. 4) (P = 0. 001). A similar trend was seen for the respective mean number of transfused units of platelets (3. 6, 3. 7, 1. 3 and 1. 0; P Conclusions While combined use of aspirin and clopidogrel shortly before CABG surgery may increase the associated risk of excess transfusion of blood products perioperatively, several study limitations prevent any confident conclusions from being drawn. Beyond challenging these findings, future research might focus on the value of both intraoperative monitoring of platelet function, and the effectiveness of antifibrinolytic agents, at reducing the risk of postoperative bleeding. </p...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveIn the {{interest}} of exploring alternatives to warfarin, we tested the hypothesis that clopidogrel combined with aspirin is effective for thromboprophylaxis of mechanical valves using a swine model. MethodsAdult swine underwent heterotopic implantation of a modified bileaflet mechanical valved conduit bypassing the ligated, native descending thoracic aorta. Animals were randomized to no anticoagulation (n = 7), 175 U/kg dalteparin administered subcutaneously twice daily (n = 9), 325 mg of aspirin (n = 6), 75 mg of <b>clopidogrel</b> (<b>n</b> = 6), or 325 mg of aspirin and 75 mg of clopidogrel daily (n = 6) and survived for 30 days. Additionally, 11 animals were randomized to no anticoagulation (n = 5) or 325 mg of oral aspirin and 75 mg of clopidogrel daily (n = 6) and survived for 150 days. ResultsAt 30 days, we observed 216 ± 270 mg of thrombus for the no anticoagulation group, 53 ± 91 mg for the dalteparin group, 33 ± 23 mg for the aspirin group, 25 ± 10 mg for the clopidogrel group, and 17 ± 9 mg for the combined aspirin and clopidogrel group, respectively (P <. 01 for clopidogrel and aspirin vs no anticoagulation). At 150 days, we observed 223 ± 200 mg of thrombus for the no anticoagulation group and 4 ± 4 mg for the aspirin and clopidogrel group (P =. 02). Mean platelet deposition on the valve was 4. 1 × 109 ± 3. 6 × 109 for the no anticoagulation and 6. 81 × 107 ± 1. 4 × 108 for the combined aspirin and clopidogrel groups, respectively (P =. 03).

40|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{represents}} {{the most common}} cause of death in industrialized countries. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is considered the standard surgical intervention in the therapy of CAD. However, the application of a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in CABG-patients often leads to post-operative cognitive decline, potentially caused by thromboembolism among other factors. Therefore, in the present study, the impact of pre-operative anti-platelet treatment, using either a single (aspirin) or a dual (aspirin/clopidogrel) pharmacotherapy, onto the cognitive performance immediately after surgery was examined. In addition, the risk of increased bleeding due to dual anti-platelet therapy is evaluated. Methods Pre- and postoperative memory performance was assessed in consecutive CABG-patients pre-operatively treated either with aspirin alone (n = 50) or with aspirin and <b>clopidogrel</b> combined (<b>n</b> = 49). Psychometric assessment involved six subtests from the “Syndrom-Kurz-Test” as well as the “Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale” and were conducted before surgery as well as between the third and fifth postoperative day. Test-scores were merged by principal component analysis into a combined neurocognitive score. Risk of bleeding was evaluated by measuring the number of transfused blood cell concentrates and blood loss. Results Both groups of patients displayed a decline in memory function. The combined neurocognitive score in both groups was significantly higher before surgery than postoperatively (single: preop - 0. 2 ± 1. 5 vs postop - 1. 8 ± 1. 7, p = 0. 000) and dual: preop 0. 2 ± 1. 5 vs postop - 0. 5 ± 2. 1, p = 0. 004). However, its decline was substantially less severe with dual anti-platelet therapy (single: 1. 6 ± 1. 6, dual: 0. 7 ± 1. 5, p = 0. 004) suggesting a clinically relevant cognitive benefit of combined aspirin/clopidogrel treatment compared to aspirin alone. Blood loss (single: 862 ml ± 453 ml; dual: 1033 ml ± 513 ml), p = 0. 075) as well as the amount of administered fresh frozen plasma (single: 0. 44 ± 1. 12, dual: 0. 51 ± 1. 24, p = 1. 00) and red blood cell concentrates (single: 1, 58 ± 1, 69, dual: 1, 41 ± 1, 49, p = 0, 752) were not significantly different between both groups. However, patients with dual antiplatelet therapy received significantly more platelet concentrates (single: 0. 32 ± 10, 1. 04, dual: 0. 92 ± 1. 54, p = 0. 008).

Results: Ticagrelor improves peripheral arterial function {{compared to the other}} groups [(1) controls 1. 78 ± 0. 53; (2) clopidogrel 1. 78 ± 0. 45; (3) prasugrel 1. 64 ± 0. 33, and (4) ticagrelor 2. 25 ± 0. 54 (means ± SD) ] with a significance of p < 0. 01 for ticagrelor versus no ADP blocker, p < 0. 01 for ticagrelor versus clopidogrel, and p < 0. 001 for ticagrelor versus prasugrel. There were fewer patients with endothelial dysfunction (< 1. 67 reactive hyperemia index) in the ticagrelor group (12 %) compared to aspirin (51 %), clopidogrel (46 %), and prasugrel (53 %) (p < 0. 01). Conclusion: Treatment with ticagrelor improves peripheral endothelial function compared to no ADP blocker, clopidogrel, or prasugrel treatment...|$|R
40|$|Factor XIII (FXIII) is {{necessary}} for cross linking of fibrin strands and generation of stable fibrin clot. FXIII Val 34 Leu is a common genetic single nucleotide polymorphism that {{has been associated with}} accelerated fibrin stabilization and reduced rate of fibrinolysis. The contribution of Val 34 Leu to long term risk of recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with coronary stenting has not been conclusively established. The objective {{of the study was to}} examine the effects of Val 34 Leu on fibrin generation, platelet aggregation, and long term clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease treated with dual antiplatelet therapy. Patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease who were treated with aspirin and <b>clopidogrel</b> were enrolled (<b>n</b> = 211). Light transmittance aggregometry and plasma fibrin clot formation using thrombelastography (TEG) were determined. Genotyping of Val 34 Leu was performed using Taqman assay. Clinical events during follow up were recorded. Homozygous carriers of 34 Leu variant had significantly shorter fibrin clot formation time as compared to wild type individuals (TEG K: 1. 27 ± 0. 3 vs. 1. 68 ± 1. 1 min, p = 0. 011). The Val 34 Leu variant was associated with gene dose dependent increased risk of MI (log rank, p = 0. 002) or occurrence of composite of MI and CV death (log rank, p = 0. 005) with highest event rates observed in homozygous carriers of 34 Leu. In summary, FXIII Val 34 Leu polymorphism was associated with increased rate of fibrin stabilization in homozygous carriers of the variant and may increase risk of recurrent MI and death in patients with angiographically established coronary artery disease treated with dual antiplatelet therapy...|$|R
40|$|Background: Despite current treatments, {{patients}} who have acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation have high rates of major vascular events. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of the antiplatelet agent clopidogrel when given with aspirin in such patients. Methods: We randomly assigned 12, 562 {{patients who}} had presented within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms to receive clopidogrel (300 mg immediately, followed by 75 mg once daily) (6259 patients) or placebo (6303 patients) in addition to aspirin for 3 to 12 months. Results: The first primary outcome [...] a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke [...] occurred in 9. 3 {{percent of the patients}} in the clopidogrel group and 11. 4 percent of the patients in the placebo group (relative risk with clopidogrel as compared with placebo, 0. 80; 95 percent confidence interval, 0. 72 to 0. 90; P< 0. 001). The second primary outcome [...] the first primary outcome or refractory ischemia [...] occurred in 16. 5 percent of the patients in the clopidogrel group and 18. 8 percent of the patients in the placebo group (relative risk, 0. 86, P< 0. 001). The percentages of patients with in-hospital refractory or severe ischemia, heart failure, and revascularization procedures were also significantly lower with clopidogrel. There were significantly more patients with major bleeding in the clopidogrel group than in the placebo group (3. 7 percent vs. 2. 7 percent; relative risk, 1. 38; P= 0. 001), but there were not significantly more patients with episodes of life-threatening bleeding (2. 1 percent vs. 1. 8 percent, P= 0. 13) or hemorrhagic strokes. Conclusions: The antiplatelet agent clopidogrel has beneficial effects in patients with acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Fibrinolytic {{therapy for}} acute ST-elevation {{myocardial}} infarction (STEMI) is frequently limited by delays in administration and by incomplete reperfusion or reocclusion of the infarct-related artery. Intensified prehospital management of STEMI may shorten time to treatment and improve outcomes. METHODS: We {{carried out a}} prospective substudy in 11 ambulance systems in 216 of the 3, 491 patients with STEMI who {{were enrolled in the}} CLARITY-TIMI 28 trial. They were randomized in the ambulance to <b>clopidogrel</b> (<b>n</b> = 109) or placebo (n = 107) along with fibrinolysis, aspirin, and heparin. The primary endpoint was the composite of an occluded infarct-related artery (TIMI flow grade 0 or 1), or death or recurrent myocardial infarction before angiography. RESULTS: All patients received a fibrin-specific lytic and the baseline characteristics in both groups were comparable. The incidence of the primary endpoint was 16. 5 % in the clopidogrel-treated and 27. 1 % in the placebo patients (adj OR 0. 62, 95 % CI 0. 31 - 1. 21, p = 0. 16), an effect that was consistent with the effects seen in the in-hospital patients in the main CLARITY-TIMI 28 trial. Prehospital clopidogrel therapy reduced the incidence of an occluded infarct-related artery on the predischarge angiogram (11. 8 % vs. 22. 3 %, adj OR 0. 52, 95 % CI 0. 24 - 1. 13, p = 0. 10). The 30 -day incidence of cardiovascular death, recurrent MI or recurrent myocardial ischemia requiring urgent revascularization was 12. 8 % vs. 14. 0 % (adj OR 1. 07, 95 % CI 0. 48 - 2. 39, p = 0. 87). Early TIMI major bleeding occurred in no clopidogrel patients compared with two placebo patients (1. 9 %). CONCLUSIONS: Addition of clopidogrel to medical reperfusion of STEMI with fibrinolysis, heparin, and aspirin before reaching the hospital is feasible in medically equipped ambulances without an apparent increase in bleeding. Furthermore, prehospital clopidogrel tended to show better early coronary patency compared to placebo, a result consistent with that observed in patients randomized in-hospital in the CLARITY-TIMI 28 trial...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThe goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the impact of high-dose atorvastatin on the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of double-dose clopidogrel in statin-naive patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and high-on-treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR) while on standard-dose clopidogrel before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BackgroundPatients with HTPR are at increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events after PCI. High-dose statins improve prognosis in high-risk patients by lipid- and nonlipid-related mechanisms, including antithrombotic effects. MethodsThe ACHIDO (Atorvastatin and Clopidogrel HIgh DOse in stable patients with residual high platelet activity) study was a randomized PD study of high-dose (80 mg) atorvastatin in addition to double-dose (150 mg) <b>clopidogrel</b> (atorvastatin group, <b>n</b> = 38) versus double-dose clopidogrel alone (control group, n = 38) in patients with HTPR. HTPR was defined as P 2 Y 12 reaction units (PRU) ≥ 235 by the VerifyNow P 2 Y 12 assay. Platelet reactivity was evaluated immediately before PCI and at 10 and 30 days. ResultsPatients randomized to atorvastatin had lower PRU values (188 ± 48 vs. 223 ± 53 PRU, p < 0. 01; primary endpoint) and HTPR rates (16 % vs. 42 %, p < 0. 01) at 30 days than patients in the control group. Statin treatment (odds ratio [OR]: 3. 8, p = 0. 011), baseline PRU < 298 (OR: 10. 7, p = 0. 0001), noncarrier status of CYP 2 C 19 * 2 loss-of-function allele (OR: 2. 9, p = 0. 043), and age (OR: 0. 94, p = 0. 032) were variables significantly associated with optimal PD response (PRU < 235) at 30 days. No correlations were found between PRU and lipid fractions. ConclusionsHigh-dose atorvastatin significantly improved the PD effects of double-dose clopidogrel in our stable CAD patients with HTPR undergoing PCI (Atorvastatin and Clopidogrel HIgh DOse in stable patients with residual high platelet activity [ACHIDO]; NCT 01335048) ...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the impact of adjunctive cilostazol in patients with high post-treatment platelet reactivity (HPPR) undergoing coronary stenting. BackgroundAlthough addition of cilostazol to dual antiplatelet therapy enhances adenosine diphosphate (ADP) -induced platelet inhibition, it is unknown whether adjunctive cilostazol can reduce HPPR. MethodsSixty patients with HPPR after a 300 -mg loading dose of clopidogrel were enrolled. HPPR was defined as maximal platelet aggregation (Aggmax) > 50 % with 5 μmol/l ADP. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either adjunctive cilostazol (triple group; n = 30) or high maintenance dose (MD) <b>clopidogrel</b> (high-MD group; <b>n</b> = 30). Platelet function was assessed at baseline and after 30 days with conventional aggregometry and the VerifyNow assay. ResultsBaseline platelet function measurements were similar in both groups. After 30 days, significantly fewer patients in the triple versus high-MD group had HPPR (3. 3 % vs. 26. 7 %, p = 0. 012). Percent inhibitions of 5 μmol/l ADP-induced Aggmaxand late platelet aggregation (Agglate) were significantly greater in the triple versus high-MD group (51. 1 ± 22. 5 % vs. 28. 0 ± 18. 5 %, p < 0. 001, and 70. 9 ± 27. 3 % vs. 45. 3 ± 23. 4 %, p < 0. 001, respectively). Percent inhibitions of 20 μmol/l ADP-induced Aggmaxand Agglatewere consistently greater in the triple versus high-MD group. Percent change of P 2 Y 12 reaction units demonstrated a higher antiplatelet effect in the triple versus high-MD group (39. 6 ± 24. 1 % vs. 23. 1 ± 29. 9 %, p = 0. 022).

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{investigated}} whether {{maintenance therapy}} with clopidogrel 150 mg/day produces greater platelet inhibition {{than the standard}} 75 -mg/day dose and whether the higher maintenance dose increases platelet inhibition in low responders to clopidogrel 75 mg/day. BackgroundPatients show interindividual variability in their platelet response to clopidogrel. Low responders could potentially obtain greater clinical benefit from greater doses of clopidogrel. MethodsOne hundred fifty-three elective percutaneous coronary intervention patients were randomized to <b>clopidogrel</b> 150 mg/day (<b>n</b> = 58) or 75 mg/day (n = 95) for 4 weeks, with vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein assay-guided switching to clopidogrel 150 mg/day after 2 weeks in low responders (platelet reactivity index ≥ 69 %). All patients received aspirin 75 mg/day. ResultsAfter 2 weeks, clopidogrel 150 mg/day produced a significantly lower platelet reactivity index than clopidogrel 75 mg/day (43. 9 ± 17. 3 % vs. 58. 6 ± 17. 7 %; p < 0. 0001). The proportion of low responders was significantly lower in patients randomized to clopidogrel 150 mg/day than in those randomized to clopidogrel 75 mg/day (8. 6 % vs. 33. 7 %; p = 0. 0004). In the clopidogrel 75 mg/day group, 64. 5 % (20 of 31) of low responders became responders after switching to clopidogrel 150 mg/day for 2 weeks. No major bleeds occurred during the study; the incidence of minor bleeds was similar in each treatment group. ConclusionsIn elective percutaneous coronary intervention patients, a 150 -mg/day clopidogrel maintenance dose produces greater inhibition of platelet function than clopidogrel 75 mg/day. In low responders to clopidogrel 75 mg/day, switching to clopidogrel 150 mg/day overcomes low responsiveness in a majority of patients. These findings warrant further clinical evaluation.

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the impact of cilostazol on neointimal hyperplasia after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). BackgroundAlthough cilostazol has reduced the extent of neointimal hyperplasia and restenosis in patients after bare-metal stent implantation, {{it is not known}} whether this effect occurs after DES implantation in diabetic patients. MethodsThis randomized, multicenter, prospective study compared triple antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel, and cilostazol, triple group, n = 200) and dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and <b>clopidogrel,</b> standard group, <b>n</b> = 200) for 6 months in patients with DM receiving DES. The primary end point was in-stent late loss at 6 months. ResultsThe 2 groups had similar baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics. The in-stent (0. 25 ± 0. 53 mm vs. 0. 38 ± 0. 54 mm, p = 0. 025) and in-segment (0. 42 ± 0. 50 mm vs. 0. 53 ± 0. 49 mm, p = 0. 031) late loss were significantly lower in the triple versus standard group, as were 6 -month in-segment restenosis (8. 0 % vs. 15. 6 %, p = 0. 033) and 9 -month target lesion revascularization (TLR) (2. 5 % vs. 7. 0 %, p = 0. 034). At 9 months, major adverse cardiac events, including death, myocardial infarction, and TLR, tended to be lower in the triple than in the standard group (3. 0 % vs. 7. 0 %, p = 0. 066). Multivariate analysis showed that sirolimus-eluting stents and the use of cilostazol were strong predictors of reduced restenosis or TLR. ConclusionsTriple antiplatelet therapy after DES implantation decreased angiographic restenosis and extent of late loss, resulting in a reduced risk of 9 -month TLR compared with dual antiplatelet therapy in diabetic patients...|$|R
40|$|Minipigs are {{frequently}} used in (neuro-) interventional research. Longitudinal experiments may require repeated vessel access via the femoral artery. Anticoagulation and incompliance {{of the animals}} necessitates {{the use of a}} vascular closure device (VCD). The effects of the Angio-Seal VCD in minipigs were longitudinally assessed. Minipig (42 ± 8. 4 kg body weight) femoral arteries were sealed using the 8 F (n = 6) or 6 F (n = 7) Angio-Seal VCD. The pre-interventional femoral artery diameter was 5. 1 ± 0. 4 mm (4. 3 - 5. 8 mm). Sealed puncture sites were analysed angiographically as well as by computed tomography angiography (CTA) for a mean period of 14. 1 ± 8. 0 weeks (1 - 22 weeks). All animals were constantly treated with acetylsalicylic acid (ASS) (450 mg/d (n = 7) or 100 mg/d (n = 1)) and <b>clopidogrel</b> (75 mg/d (<b>n</b> = 8)). Non-instrumented (n = 2) and arteries sealed using the VCD (n = 2) were examined histologically. No postoperative hemorrhagic complications were observed. Three arteries were occluded after VCD placement (1 animal diagnosed after 4 weeks (8 F), 2 animals after 1 week (6 F)) and remained so {{until the end of the}} experiments after 22, 12 and 4 weeks, respectively. In one artery a 50 % stenosis 8 weeks after application of a 6 F Angio-Seal was detected. In 69. 2 % (n = 9) the VCD was applied without complications. Histopathological analysis of the sealed arterial segments showed subtotal obliteration of the vessel lumen, formation of collagenous tissue and partial damage of the internal elastic lamina. The Angio-Seal VCD prevents relevant hemorrhagic complications in minipigs treated with dual platelet inhibition, but is associated with increased vessel occlusion rates...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Pretreatment with {{clopidogrel}} before percutaneous coronary intervention improves cardiovascular outcomes. However, {{some patients}} require elective {{coronary artery bypass}} graft (CABG) surgery instead, possibly increasing bleeding complications. We sought to assess the hemorrhagic complications and the length of hospital stay of stable patients receiving clopidogrel pretreatment that are referred for CABG. Methods: Between March and August 2007, 493 patients underwent diagnostic catheterization; 54 patients underwent elective CABG and were stratified according to <b>clopidogrel</b> loading dose (<b>n</b> = 20) or not (n = 34). Incidences of major hemorrhagic events and median post-surgical hospital stay were compared between groups. Results: TIMI Bleeding Index was not significantly different between the clopidogrel and no-clopidogrel groups (mean difference 0. 46; 95 % CI - 0. 89 to 1. 82; p = 0. 5). The incidence of major TIMI bleeding (70 % vs. 73. 5 %; p > 0. 9), peak hemoglobin loss > 5 g/dL (60 % vs. 38. 2 %; p = 0. 2), and blood transfusion > 4 units (20 % vs. 26. 5 %; p = 0. 7) in clopidogrel vs. no-clopidogrel group were not statistically different. Interestingly, the post-surgical length of stay was longer for the no-clopidogrel group (median of 5 vs. 7 days; p = 0. 006). Conclusion: There was no significant evidence of increased bleeding or need for blood transfusion during CABG in patients pretreated with clopidogrel. The current practice of clopidogrel pretreatment before percutaneous coronary intervention does not significantly increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications in stable patients provided they can wait for at least 7 days before CABG. In a single center retrospective study, clopidogrel pretreatment was not found to be associated with increased bleeding or need for blood transfusion during {{coronary artery bypass graft}} surgery, suggesting that clopidogrel pretreatment before percutaneous coronary intervention does not significantly increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications in stable patients provided they can wait for 7 days before the surgery...|$|R
40|$|Background In the PLATO trial, ticagrelor was {{superior}} to clopidogrel in reducing cardiovascular events among patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) {{at the expense of}} increased nonfatal bleeding. Because Asian patients, when compared with non-Asian patients, are believed to be more susceptible to bleeding, we evaluated the effects of ticagrelor compared with <b>clopidogrel</b> in Asian (<b>n</b> = 1, 106) and non-Asian (n = 17, 515) patients with acute coronary syndrome enrolled in the PLATO study. Methods and Results Interaction between Asian/non-Asian and primary efficacy end point (a composite of vascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) and net clinical benefit (composite of primary efficacy end point and coronary artery bypass graft [CABG] surgery or non-CABG-related major bleeding) were evaluated with a Cox proportional hazards model. Baseline demographics and comorbidities were different between Asians and non-Asians. The overall cardiovascular event rates were higher in Asians, but bleeding rates were similar. Despite these observed differences, the effects of ticagrelor versus clopidogrel were not significantly different between Asians and non-Asians with respect to the primary efficacy outcome (hazard ratio for Asians vs non-Asians, 0. 84 [95 % CI 0. 61 - 1. 17] vs 0. 85 [95 % CI 0. 77 - 0. 93], P =. 974), net clinical benefit (0. 85 [95 % CI 0. 65 - 1. 11] vs 0. 93 [95 % CI 0. 86 - 0. 99], P =. 521), or individual efficacy end points. There was no significant interaction for bleeding (PLATO major bleeding, 1. 02 [95 % CI 0. 70 - 1. 49] vs 1. 04 [95 % CI 0. 95 - 1. 14], P =. 938) and other related adverse events with ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel between Asians and non-Asians. Conclusions We observed consistency of effects in Asian patients receiving ticagrelor and clopidogrel in the PLATO study.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Clopidogrel is an {{antiplatelet}} agent {{converted to}} its active metabolite by cytochrome P- 450 isoenzymes. Numerous drugs {{are known to}} inhibit P- 450 isoenzymes, including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which are often associated with aspirin and clopidogrel to prevent adverse gastrointestinal effects. In vitro studies first showed that PPIs reduced the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel, while recent clinical studies have raised concerns that {{the addition of a}} PPI to clopidogrel in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients could actually increase the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether the prescription of a PPI conferred a worse prognosis in patients discharged with aspirin and clopidogrel treatment after ACS. METHODS: A total of 876 patients admitted with ACS and discharged with aspirin and clopidogrel, with a planned duration of at least six months, from January 2004 to March 2008, were reviewed. Patients were classified in two groups according to whether or not a PPI was prescribed at discharge. The PPIs considered were those mainly metabolized by cytochrome P- 450 2 C 19. We excluded patients with insufficient information available on either prescription or clinical records that could allow clearly confirm or exclude exposure to a PPI. Primary end points were six-month all-cause mortality and the composite of death, myocardial infarction and unstable angina at six months. RESULTS: Of the 802 patients considered for further analysis, 274 (34. 2 %) individuals were medicated with a PPI in addition to dual antiplatelet therapy. Patients taking PPIs were older, more often had renal insufficiency and less often had a history of coronary revascularization and smoking. They more often presented with Killip class >I and lower hemoglobin concentration on admission. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of medical treatment (during hospital stay and at discharge) or invasive procedures. By multivariate analysis, independent and positive predictors of PPI prescription were older age and lower hemoglobin concentration on admission. Patients taking PPIs had a slightly higher prevalence of six-month mortality (6. 5 % vs. 3. 9 %) and of the composite end point (12. 9 % vs. 9. 2 %), although without statistical significance. By multivariate analysis including potential confounding variables, the prescription of a PPI on top of aspirin and <b>clopidogrel</b> was still <b>n</b> ot associated with a worse prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, PPI precription in addition to aspirin and clopidogrel after ACS was not associated with a worse six-month prognosis...|$|R
