5|$|The {{large size}} and <b>cutting</b> <b>teeth</b> of the silky shark make it {{potentially}} dangerous, {{and it has}} behaved aggressively towards divers. However, attacks are rare, as few humans enter its oceanic habitat. Silky sharks are valued for their fins, {{and to a lesser}} extent their meat, hide, liver oil, and jaws. Because of their abundance, they form a major component of commercial and artisanal shark fisheries in many countries. Furthermore, their association with tuna results in many sharks being taken as bycatch in tuna fisheries. Although slow-reproducing like most other sharks, the wide distribution and large population size of the silky shark was once thought to buffer the species against these fishing pressures. However, data now suggest that silky shark numbers are declining around the world, which prompted the IUCN to reassess its conservation status from Least Concern to Near Threatened in 2007.|$|E

50|$|Best safety {{requires}} that the chain is properly sharpened. One key sharpening parameter is the depth gauge setting. The depth gauge is the small steel protuberance {{in front of each}} <b>cutting</b> <b>tooth.</b> The difference in height between the leading cutting edge and the depth gauge determines the thickness of the wood chip taken by the cutter. If the depth gauge is too low, the cutter takes too deep a bite from the wood, the saw becomes difficult to control and the chances of kickback increase.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to understand the}} mechanics of material removal during rock cutting. The exact nature of the failure of the rock material at the tool tip was investigated using a single <b>cutting</b> <b>tooth</b> test rig coupled with high speed photography, for various rock-like specimens. Linear cutting tests were performed using a tungsten carbide tipped orthogonal cutting tool with three different rake angles on low and high strength simulated rocks. Statistical analysis together with high speed video analysis were supported by numerical simulation, performed using a commercially available code called ELFEN; a hybrid finite-discrete element software package...|$|R

60|$|The {{teeth of}} a horse are not less {{peculiar}} than its limbs. The living engine, like all others, must be well stoked {{if it is to}} do its work; and the horse, if it is to make good its wear and tear, and to exert the enormous amount of force required for its propulsion, must be well and rapidly fed. To this end, good cutting instruments and powerful and lasting crushers are needful. Accordingly, the twelve <b>cutting</b> <b>teeth</b> {{of a horse}} are close-set and concentrated in the fore part of its mouth, like so many adzes or chisels. The grinders or molars are large, and have an extremely complicated structure, being composed of a number of different substances of unequal hardness. The consequence of this is that they wear away at different rates; and, hence, the surface of each grinder is always as uneven as that of a good millstone.|$|E

6000|$|Some other {{peculiarities of}} the {{dentition}} {{of the horse}} must be noticed, as they bear upon what I shall have to say by and by. Thus the crowns of the <b>cutting</b> <b>teeth</b> have a peculiar deep pit, which {{gives rise to the}} well-known [...] "mark" [...] of the horse. There is a large space between the outer incisors and the front grinder. In this space the adult male horse presents, near the incisors on each side, above and below, a canine or [...] "tush," [...] which is commonly absent in mares. In a young horse, moreover, there is not unfrequently to be seen in front of the first grinder, a very small tooth, which soon falls out. If this small tooth be counted as one, it will be found that there are seven teeth behind the canine on each side; namely, the small tooth in question, and the six great grinders, among which, by an unusual peculiarity, the foremost tooth is rather larger than those which follow it.|$|E
