40|$|Abstract- Bursts {{of regular}} microsecond-scale {{electric}} field pulses produced by three multiple-stroke cloud-to-ground dis-charges (a total of 2782 pulses) and by three <b>cloud</b> <b>discharges</b> (a total of 1436 pulses), all recorded within 20 km or {{so at the}} NASA Kennedy Space Center, are analyzed. The regular pulse bursts are similar in both cloud-to-ground and <b>cloud</b> <b>discharges.</b> A burst is characterized by some tens of pulses, each having a total width of a few microseconds, with an average interpuke interval of 6 - 7 ps. Pulse peaks in cloud-to-ground discharges are approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than return-stroke initial field peaks in the same flash. In both <b>cloud</b> and ground <b>discharges,</b> {{there is a tendency}} for the bursts to occur in the latter stages of a discharge, and positive and negative pulse polarities are about equally probable. Many bursts were found {{to be associated with the}} latter part of K changes while one pronounced M change appeared to be initiated by a regular pulse burst. The observed regular pulse bursts exhibit some similarity to the “multiple burst ” (component H) of the standard lightning environment for the design and testing of aerospace vehicles 111.

This research tries to add more analyses to few previous researches done in tropical regions.

The D region is to be monitored only with signals- it may be man-made or natural signal of <b>cloud</b> <b>discharge.</b> The problem with the <b>cloud</b> <b>discharge</b> is that source parameters do not remain constant, whereas source characteristics of man-made signals are always constant.

40|$|Lightning {{electric}} field (E) and {{electric field}} derivative (dE/dt) signals {{have been recorded}} using sensors with 40 ns and 10 ns response times, respectively. Field propagation between the source and the recording antennas was entirely over salt water, so that distortions due to ground wave propagation were minimal below about 20 MHz. The fast-varying, initial portions of return stroke E fields have 10 % to 90 % risetimes which average 90 ± 40 ns. Peak dE/dt values range from 7 to 71 V/m/μs, with a {{mean and standard deviation}} of 33 ± 14 V/m/μs, when normalized to 100 km using an inverse distance dependence. The shapes of first and subsequent stroke fields are similar, but peak subsequent stroke dE/dts are larger than peak first stroke dE/dts in some flashes. The temporal structure of the fast varying fields produced by leader steps near the ground are very similar to return stroke fields. The mean maximum leader dE/dt, at 100 km, is 27 ± 9 V/m/μs. Large amplitude radiation fields produced by <b>cloud</b> <b>discharge</b> processes tend to be bipolar, with either positive or negative initial polarity and usually have several, fast, unipolar pulses superimposed on the initial half cycle. <b>Cloud</b> <b>discharge</b> fields with positive initial polarity usually precede cloud-to-ground flashes and produce a mean maximum dE/dt of 16 ± 8 V/m/μs. The field derivatives for all processes tend to be large when the amplitude of the associated fast field change is large. Estimates of lightning current derivatives, made using range normalized dE/dt measurements, average 155 ± 70 kA/μs, 135 ± 45 kA/μs, and 80 ± 40 kA/μs, for return strokes, leader steps, and cloud discharges, respectively, and a current wavefront velocity of 1 x 10 ⁸ m/s. These values are about 10 times larger than the maximum dI/dt recorded in strikes to instrumented towers.

40|$|The cloud-to-ground {{lightning}} contains {{one or more}} sporadic <b>discharges.</b> These <b>cloud</b> <b>discharges</b> usually {{include a}} pre-starting process which is called the preliminary breakdown (PB) before a leader initiation.

The tendency for the larger pulses to occur early in the cloud flash suggests that they are related to the initial in-cloud channel formation processes and contradicts the common view found in the atmospheric radio-noise literature that the main sources of VLF/LF electromagnetic radiation in cloud flashes are the K processes which occur in the final, or J type, part of the <b>cloud</b> <b>discharge...</b>|$|E
40|$|This aim of {{this paper}} is to study the {{preliminary}} breakdown pulses (PBP) of positive cloud-to-ground (+CG) lightning flashes in Malaysia. There is a difference in PBP characteristics when a comparison is made between positive and negative flashes. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time the PBP characteristics preceding positive lightning in Malaysia are reported. This study was carried out in Johor Bahru, Malaysia using a broadband antenna system during a monsoon period (Oct-Dec, 2012). It is found that the PBP for +CG lightning is much more complicated compared to the positive cloud-to-ground (-CG) lightning since only negative PBP trains are usually present in the -CG lightning. Out of 21 analyzed positive flashes, four types of PBP trains were identified according to their initial polarities. These are negative PBP (20 %), positive PBP (15 %), PBP with polarity reversal (10 %), and PBP with irregular polarity (15 %). The balance 40 % of flashes is without any PBP.

40|$|Trans Ionospheric Pulse Pairs are VHF signals {{consisting}} of exactly two broadband pulses, each with duration of few microseconds. The time {{separation of the}} pulses is typically tens of microseconds. Each pulse exhibits a frequency dispersion indicative of a sub-ionospheric origin. These emissions were distinguished from other naturally occurring radio emissions and were suspected {{to be associated with}} thunderstorms; because they were recorded onboard satellite when lightning activity was within the satellite’s VHF horizon. In the present paper we try to explain the two pulses of TIPPs by considering the propagation of electromagnetic waves generated during lightning discharge in two different modes. The lightning discharge is represented by the combination of two Dirac delta functions. First one for the ground to <b>cloud</b> <b>discharge</b> current and the other one is cloud to ionosphere discharge. The Maxwell’s equations are solved to derive the expression for wave-electric field as a function of frequency and distance. The exact time-dependence of the propagating non-monochromatic signal for the realistic ionospheric (IRI) model is numerically computed alongwith the IGRF model for the variation of gyrofrequency with altitude. It is observed that the separation between two signal pulses depends on the pulse separation of the excitation source; however, the intensity of the signal depends directly on the pulse height of the source current...|$|E

Statistics {{on the structure of}} the waveforms and the radiance of the channels are given. The relationship between the light signals and the associated electric field signatures is discussed. It is shown that the initial light signal from a return stroke tends to be linear for about 15 microsec and then rises more slowly to a peak that is delayed by approximately 60 microsec from the electric field peak. It is thought that the transition between the fast linear portion and the slower rise {{may be due to the}} return stroke entering the cloud base.

The software radio was programmed to record this radiation by integrating GPS clock and absolute timing. Moreover, two USRP N 210 were employed to simultaneously record data at VHF and UHF bands with different programmable gain settings. This data was compared with the data from National Lightning Detection Network (available as location, type and peak current of lightning) and the magnetic sensor operating at LF (30 to 300 kHz). The output of USRP is the antenna displacement current &# 8706;E/&# 8706;t (uncalibrated) and of LF magnetic sensor is the induced voltage &# 8706;B/&# 8706;t. From comparison, the following results were obtained. K processes or regular pulse bursts in both cloud and cloud to ground discharges were clearly visible at UHF-VHF-LF. These processes were even visible at VHF with 0 dB gain, if superimposed on high magnitude slow (electric field change) processes such as J process probably. Distant Narrow bipolar pulses were observed with significant magnitude at VHF. Initial breakdown in <b>cloud</b> <b>discharge</b> was strong at LF and VHF but not significant at UHF.

The lightning data studied and presented here were due both to cloud lightning and to very close (about 20 m from the line) artificially initiated lightning. For cloud sources, a frequency-domain computer program called EMPLIN was used to calculate induced line voltages as a function of source elevation, angle of incidence, and wave polarization of the radiated <b>cloud</b> <b>discharge</b> pulses in order to compare with the measurements. For very-close lightning, the measured line voltages could be grouped into two categories, those in which multiple, similarly shaped, evenly spaced pulses were observed, which we call oscillatory, and those dominated by a principal pulse with subsidiary oscillations of much smaller amplitude, which we call impulsive. The amplitude of the induced voltage ranged from tens of kilovolts for oscillatory voltages to hundreds of kilovolts for impulsive voltages. A new technique is derived for the calculation of the electromagnetic fields from nearby lightning to ground above an imperfectly conducting ground.

40|$|Abstract. The {{impact of}} {{lightning}} on humans and its threats on life and structures have encouraged the scientists to pursue study in this field. Lightning flash {{is a high}} current electric discharge that can be classified into five categories which are intra-cloud <b>discharges,</b> <b>cloud</b> to cloud, cloud to air, ground to cloud and <b>cloud</b> to ground <b>discharges.</b> Intra-cloud discharges have the main portion of the lightning flashes. The most damages and disturbances of lightning flashes are due to cloud to ground and ground to <b>cloud</b> flashes. The <b>discharge</b> phenomenon has various behaviors even in the same thunderstorm. The cloud to ground lightning discharge starts with preliminary breakdown pulses followed by leaders which cause return strokes. The subsequent strokes happen after the first return stroke in a typical lightning flash, but in few flashes the discharges do not lead to any subsequent strokes. This research investigates on these types of flashes which are called isolated breakdown lightning flashes, in Malaysia. The isolated breakdown flashes have rarely been seen in tropical regions compared with temperate areas.

The weather {{is dominated by}} the southeastern trade winds that originate in the Indian Ocean anticyclone, a center of high atmospheric pressure that seasonally changes its position over the ocean. Madagascar has two seasons: a warm, wet season from November to April; and a cooler, dry season from May to October. There is, however, great variation in climate owing to elevation and position relative to dominant winds. The east coast has an equatorial climate; being most directly exposed to the trade winds it has the highest rainfall, averaging as high as 4000 mm annually in some places depending on elevation (direction of slope on mountainsides), distance to the coast, and latitudinal location. This region is notorious for a hot, humid climate in which tropical fevers are endemic and also for the destructive cyclones that occur during the rainy season, coming in principally {{from the direction of the}} Mascarene Islands. Because rain <b>clouds</b> <b>discharge</b> much of their moisture east of the highest elevations on the island, the central highlands are drier and, owing to the altitude, also cooler.

Efficient detection and reporting of IC emission has been achieved mainly with VHF arrays. The Munich group studies VLF/LF radiation with methods equally sensitive to CG and IC signals and utilized a new 21 -sensor network (LINET, lightning detection network) to obtain total lightning data by means of a single technique. Three important network features are i) the measurement of estimated currents as low as ~ 1 kA, a range which has attracted little experimental attention in the past, ii) discrimination of IC events from CG strokes by means of a special 3 D-feature in the location algorithm, and (iii) the reporting of IC emission heights. In accordance with general expectations, high IC event rates have been found at low amplitudes. Typical IC’s exhibit multi-polar pulse-trains which defy assignment of a clear-cut sign for the amplitude; however, there is also a large portion of IC events which are sufficiently mono-polar to allow classification as having positive or negative polarity.
