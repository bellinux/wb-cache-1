5|$|A central {{pledge of}} President Bill Clinton's {{campaign}} was {{to reform the}} welfare system, adding changes such as work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the Clinton Administration appeared to be more concerned with pursuing a universal health <b>care</b> <b>program.</b> Gingrich accused Clinton of stalling on welfare, and proclaimed that Congress could pass a welfare reform bill {{in as little as}} 90 days. He insisted that the Republican Party would continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve their welfare legislation.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for hospice, a patient has to be {{certified}} as having a prognosis of {{less than six months}} to live. Sometimes patients live longer. Medicare patients who receive the hospice benefit must waive other Medicare benefits that could prolong life. Under the Medicare provisions, the hospice benefit through the first six months is broken up into two 90-day benefit periods. At the end of these two benefit periods, the hospice team will evaluate whether or not the patient continues to have a prognosis of less than six months to live. Following these two 90-day benefit periods, the hospice is required to evaluate more closely and review the case every 60 days. Commercial insurers, managed <b>care</b> <b>program</b> providers, and Medicaid often have their own regulations regarding re-certification. When the hospice re-certifies a six-month or less prognosis, this is based on the patient's current condition.|$|E
40|$|<b>Care</b> <b>programming</b> was {{introduced}} {{as a national}} system of care for all people in contact with psychiatric services from April, 1991. It requires full assessment of the individual, a nominated key worker, explicit care planning, including the measurement of unmet need, and regular reviews. This paper {{is based on the}} results of a one-year study, funded by the Department of Health, of the implementation of <b>care</b> <b>programming</b> in three contrasting health districts. It looks specifically at three questions: which client groups were included on the care programme approach, what unmet needs were identified, and how much <b>care</b> <b>programming</b> appears to cost, both at the service level, and for individual service users. We analyse findings from interviews with 60 mental health workers and 60 service users to present a portrait of <b>care</b> <b>programming.</b> Although primarily descriptive, this information can be used to guide the development of <b>care</b> <b>programming</b> and other mental health services, as well as to assist in the formulation of care packages, the allocation of budgets in mental health and, eventually, the evaluation of the effectiveness of <b>care</b> <b>programming...</b>|$|R

40|$|In 2008, a California HealthCare Foundation (CHCF) {{report on}} California hospital-based palliative <b>care</b> <b>programs</b> found that {{although}} 43 % of all {{hospitals in the}} state had palliative <b>care</b> <b>programs,</b> only 22 % of public hospitals (4 of 17) had palliative <b>care</b> <b>programs.</b> Due to the state's fiscal crisis, many public hospitals lacked the funds to establish or expand palliative care services. Recognizing {{that a lack of}} palliative care services in public hospitals was a barrier to providing appropriate care for their underserved populations, in 2008 CHCF launched a partnership with the California Safety Net Institute (SNI) and the University of California, San Francisco, Palliative Care Leadership Center (PCLC). The goal of this five-year initiative, Spreading Palliative Care in Public Hospitals (SPCPH), was to develop new, sustainable in-patient palliative <b>care</b> <b>programs</b> in California's public hospital system and to support expansion and enhancement of existing public hospital palliative <b>care</b> <b>programs,</b> with an emphasis on reaching diverse communities.

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the extent to which}} children with special needs were successfully integrated in school-age <b>care</b> <b>programs.</b> It also investigated the factors presented in the literature as being related to successful integration. These included quality of the environment, attitude and level of education, training and experience of staff members, preparation and planning, communication with the parents, modifications made to programs, and centre policies on integration. Twenty school-age <b>care</b> <b>programs</b> in the metropolitan area participated in the study. Interviews were conducted with 20 directors and 17 educators of the school-age <b>care</b> <b>programs</b> regarding the factors related to successful integration. Participants also answered a questionnaire investigating the child care staff's attitude and experience with integration. Parents of the special needs children attending the participating school-age <b>care</b> <b>programs</b> were sent a questionnaire examining their satisfaction with the quality of the centers as well as their previous and actual experience with the integration of their children.

MethodsSeven databases were searched electronically for articles describing {{evaluations of}} antenatal <b>care</b> <b>programs</b> developed for Australian Indigenous women. Manual searches were performed of the publication sections of websites of Australian Government Departments responsible for health and Indigenous affairs. ResultsEvaluations of 10 antenatal <b>care</b> <b>programs</b> were identified. Wide variations were present in the design, quality and reported outcomes of each evaluation. There was a lack of consistency in the findings across all <b>care</b> <b>programs</b> for many outcomes. Modest increases were reported for measures of care utilization, including the proportion of women initiating care in the first trimester and the mean number of antenatal visits overall. For birth outcomes, benefits were reported by some but not all <b>care</b> <b>programs</b> for perinatal mortality, preterm birth, mean birth weight and the proportion of low birth weight infants. Of the four <b>care</b> <b>programs</b> reporting women’s views about care, most comments were positive reflections about care, including the use of female staff and the continuity of care providers. ConclusionsThe impact of the antenatal <b>care</b> <b>programs</b> evaluated and published to date remains inconclusive.
