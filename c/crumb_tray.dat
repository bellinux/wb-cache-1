60|$|Before {{leaving the}} library {{for the night}} I placed in a {{conspicuous}} position in the room a small table, on which was a tray holding two decanters partially filled with wine, in the one red {{and in the other}} white. There was also upon the tray an open box of biscuit and three wine-glasses, two of them with a little wine at the bottom. I took pains to make it appear that these refreshments had been recently partaken of. There were biscuit <b>crumbs</b> upon the <b>tray,</b> and a drop or two of wine was freshly spilled upon it every time the trap was set. The table, thus arranged, was left in the room during the night, and early in the morning I put the tray and its contents into a closet and locked it up.|$|R
