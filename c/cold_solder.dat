40|$|Dissertation {{consists}} of introduction, four chapters, conclusions {{and a list}} of literature of 118 designations. Total dissertation size is 151 pages. It contains 23 tables, 5 figures, 45 graphs and 4 photographs. Actuality of the theme was substantiated, object and tasks of work were formulated, scientific novelty of obtained results and their practical significance were reported, tenets of defense were formulated and also publications of work results were enlisted. Review of scientific literature both on question of physical-mechanical features of metal surfaces and on question of interaction of conjugated surfaces during static contact and under shear conditions was implemented. Earlier known methods of use of surface coatings for metal joining were reported and short review of foundation hypothesis of metal joining during their combine plastic deformation was given. On base of analysis of existing "cold" methods of metal joining (<b>cold</b> welding, <b>cold</b> <b>soldering,</b> <b>cold</b> shear welding) a conclusion was drawn considering necessity of an experimental testing of use of soft metal coatings in combination with shear in order to join metal specimens - so called <b>cold</b> shear <b>soldering.</b> Both experiment equipment and experiment method was described. Optimal routing for strenght test of soldered joining was worked out. After testing the well-known methods of experiments on strenght of joining it was decided to characterize the strenght of joining through strenght on edge (under normal load which equal to zero) that is carried out in the same direction because in this case there were obtained more stable results. Deduction of nondiscrete-logical model of process of <b>cold</b> shear <b>soldering</b> was implemented. On NL-model basis main technological parameters of process was determined. Afterwards their preliminary optimization was fulfilled. As pre-optimization result there were obtained values of parameters which were used later for optimization process by Box-Wilson method. Influence of main technological parameters to the process of <b>cold</b> shear <b>soldering</b> was investigated. Optimization of process using method of many-factors experiment planning was accomplished and optimal mode <b>cold</b> shear <b>soldering</b> was refined. The largest strenght of specimens joining was observed for specimens which were treated with emery paper M 40. Time of specimens hold-up on air after their treatment till shear has no significant influence of result. Optimal parameters were obtained as follows: thickness of tin covering on copper - equal to 0. 130 mm, value of specimens shear relatively each other -equal to 7 mm. Value of mormal loading is limited with experiment conditions. For our conditions of experiment optimal value was declared equal to 2600 N and shear exertion equal to 8500 N. Comparative analysis of rating and experimental values of actual contact area was implemented. Dependence of value of actual contact area on the main technological parameters was investigated. Basic normality of interaction of being sheared relatively each other metal solids and basic normality of joining formation mechanism under condition of simultaneous affection on contacting specimens the normal load and tangential displacements was described. Work contains results that confirm expediency of further study of <b>cold</b> shear <b>soldering</b> process. Possibility of its practical application is substantiated. Set of advantages of <b>cold</b> shear <b>soldering</b> in comparison with the other methods of metal joining is shown.

5000|$|Fused {{deposition}} modeling {{is handled}} by 3D Systems' hobbyist level printer line. These printers use a heated extruder to deposit a thermoplastic along complex toolpaths, one layer at a time. A good visual model {{of this is}} using a hot glue gun to build a 3d model. The hot glue gun (a hand powered extruder) would have to build things one layer at a time, depositing a string roughly {{the width of the}} extruder orifice. Once a layer has cooled and hardened, the next layer can be built until the model is complete. FDM limitations include time (it must travel along complex toolpaths), color (only one color can be printed at a time), and durability (inter-layer adhesion is analogous to a <b>cold</b> <b>solder).</b> This is generally the least expensive type of printer available.|$|E
5000|$|The KG-13 {{employed}} [...] "FLYBALL" [...] modules. These were modules made {{of discrete}} components {{set up as}} logic element circuit groups such as NAND gates, NOR gates, XOR gates, flip flops, monostables, multivibrators, etc. Once tested, the modules were potted in a compound whose colour indicated their function. The coloured potting compound was extremely hard and any attempt to penetrate it resulted in damage to the internal circuitry. In a KG-13, the following colours are confirmed: Pink, Yellow, Green, Blue, Red, Orange and Black. Purple and Brown modules were probably used but those colours are unconfirmed as of this time. Yellow modules were single transistor emitter follower clock drivers. Pink modules were two transistor shift register flip flops. Each yellow module drove nine pink ones. A two transistor multivibrator module drove the audio alarm thru an amplifier. Two transistor monostables were also used. NAND and NOR modules were built from a single transistor and XOR modules were built from two transistors. Failures usually occurred in the power supplies, buffers, and synchronizers though most problems were quickly resolved. When new, there was a high frequency of failures due to <b>cold</b> <b>solder</b> joints. One board in the KG-13 had a black module which was a noise generator containing a Zener diode noise source. This was the only classified module because the noise was used to randomize the key stream on startup. The circuitry inside the module then used the koken chain shift registers to create an pseudo random key stream. That was why {{there was no problem}} in restarting the KG-13 with the same card. The noise source ensured that the chances of duplicating the start point was negligible.|$|E

The elaborate process begins with the skeletal framework called Ghaat. Thereafter, the Paadh procedure takes place, during which wax is poured onto the framework and moulded according to the design. Following this is the Khudai process, when the stones or uncut gems are fit into the framework. Meenakari then involves enameling to define the design details. Next, the Pakai process involves gold foils that hold the gems onto the framework; these are <b>cold</b> <b>soldered</b> using burnishing techniques. Finally, the gems are polished using the Chillai process.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{technique}} and a nonthermal soldering method {{to improve the}} performance of AgHT- 8 transparent polymer antennas are proposed in this letter. The proposed technique involves {{the removal of the}} coating layer at areas on the coplanar waveguide (CPW) ground and feed line where the connectors of the coaxial feed or legs of the SMA connectors will be attached and applying a coat of silver paint on the exposed areas before cold-soldering the coaxial connections or SMA connector legs.

50|$|Resistance {{soldering}} {{is unlike}} using a conduction iron, where heat is produced within an element and then {{passed through a}} thermally conductive tip into the joint area. A <b>cold</b> <b>soldering</b> iron requires time to reach working temperature and must be kept hot between solder joints. Thermal transfer may be inhibited if the tip is not kept properly wetted during use. With resistance soldering an intense heat can be rapidly developed directly within the joint area and in a tightly controlled manner. This allows a faster ramp up to the required solder melt temperature and minimizes thermal travel away from the solder joint, which helps to minimize the potential for thermal damage to materials or components in the surrounding area. Heat is only produced while each joint is being made, making resistance soldering more energy efficient. Resistance soldering equipment, unlike conduction irons, {{can be used for}} difficult soldering and brazing applications where significantly higher temperatures may be required. This makes resistance comparable to flame soldering in some situations. When the required temperature can be achieved by either flame or resistance methods the resistance heat is more localized because of direct contact, whereas the flame will spread thus heating a potentially larger area.|$|R
30|$|According to {{the results}} of this study, it was showed that with {{straight}} abutments, %postload RTL was lower than %initial RTL. This result could be explained by Squier et al. [33] who stated that abutments of the conical hybrid connection showed detorque values higher than the initial torque due to the <b>cold</b> <b>solder</b> on the implant–abutment interface, which agrees with the results of this study. This condition arises from the friction between the two surfaces, which differ slightly; the pressure created by the insertion force determines the maintenance of the connection even after stopping the applied force for insertion.|$|E

40|$|Because of the {{potential}} danger that Lead poses to human health, Parliament of the European Union approved a law to take effect on July 1, 2006 which forbids the use of lead in electrical and electronic products. As a result, manufacturers throughout the world started to look into replacing lead-based solder with lead-free pastes {{using a combination of}} alloys. During this transition, many issues have been found related to the reliability of the solder joints under a lead-free process. One of the findings is the <b>solder</b> <b>cold</b> joints effect produced by this new alloy that can potentially {{have a major impact on}} the reliability of electronic systems. Two major factors, conveyor tunnel speed, and different melting temperatures, need to be fully investigated to optimize the production process of using lead-free solder pastes. Our research emphasizes the impact of these two major parameters on the lead-free production process. The investigation is conducted through a designed experiment considering the afore-mentioned factors by using two different conveyor speeds treated under different levels of temperatures. Raw testing data were gathered from a reflow oven and appropriate statistical analysis will be performed to help identify optimal settings of reflow oven parameters. The results can potentially help improve manufacturing processes and productivity. This article presents our preliminary research results of using lead-free solder paste in an electronic production line at different temperatures and conveyor speeds.
