50|$|The geology {{under the}} city of Tallin {{is made up of}} rocks and sediments of {{different}} composition and age. Youngest are the Quaternary deposits. These deposits are made up of till, varved clay, sand, gravel and pebbles that are of glacial, marine and lacustrine origin. Some of the Quaternary deposits are valuable as they constitute aquifers or, {{as in the case of}} gravels and sands, are used as construction materials. The Quaternary deposits are the fill of valleys that are now buried. The buried valleys of Tallin are carved into older rock likely by ancient rivers to be later modified by glaciers. While the valley fill is made up of Quaternary sediments the valley themselves originated from erosion that took place before the Quaternary. The substrate into which the buried valleys were carved is made up of hard sedimentary rock of Ediacaran, Cambrian and Ordovician age. Only the upper layer of Ordovician rocks protrudes from the cover of younger deposits <b>croping</b> out in the Baltic Klint at the coast and at a few places inland. The Ordovician rocks are made up of from top to bottom of a thick layer of limestone and marlstone, then a first layer of argillite followed by first layer of sandstone and siltstone and then another layer of argillite also followed by sandstone and siltstone. In other places of the city hard sedimentary rock is only to be found beneath Quaternary sediments at depths reaching as much as 120 meters below sea level. Underlying the sedimentary rock are the rocks of the Fennoscandian Craton including gneisses and other metamorphic rocks with volcanic rock protoliths and rapakivi granites. The mentioned rocks are much older than the rest (Paleoproterozoic age) and do not crop out anywhere in Estonia.|$|E

These stocks were released only under particular events, such as heavy rains, or pesticide applications with high pressure sprayers. Other cropping practices causing leaf shaking, such as pruning, may enhance spore dispersal. Over the observation period, the onset of spore dispersal was observed during a period with no rain following a rainy period, suggesting the detrimental effect of rains on epidemic onset.

The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the susceptibility to compaction of different classes of soils under no-tillage (NT) <b>croping</b> system compared to the original condition. Thus, i) soils with the same source material have distinct resistance to compression with increased NT adoption time; ii) the most sensitive indicators of this change are the ratios mass:volume and volume:volume and; iii) there is a relationship between resistance and compaction susceptibility with the amount and type of oxide. Soil samples were collected in areas under NT and under natural condition in order to assess the impact imposed by the NT on the attributes density and porosity, precompression stress and compressibility index and relate them to the oxide type of, and content in, the soils under study. The results show that the density and macroporosity were those most affected by the NT agricultural use, regardless of soil type, that is, its dynamic is related more to soil use and less to mineralogical characteristics. The soil resistance and compaction susceptibility were higher in soil developed in basalt, followed by those developed in sandstone and granite.

I went to [...] bed, but I couldn't sleep; and turned out, away late in the [...] night, and went wandering over to this prisoner's place and [...] all around about there a good while, hoping I would run across [...] my poor brother, and never knowing he was out of his troubles [...] and gone to a better shore--" [...] So he broke down and choked up [...] again, and most all the women was crying now. Pretty soon he [...] got another start and says: [...] "But it warn't no use; so at last [...] I went home and tried to get some sleep, but couldn't. Well, [...] {{in a day or two}} everybody was uneasy, and they got to talking [...] about this prisoner's threats, and took to the idea, which I [...] didn't take no stock in, that my brother was murdered so they [...] hunted around and tried to find his body, but couldn't and [...] give it up. And so I reckoned he was gone off somers to have [...] a little peace, and would come back to us when his troubles [...] was kind of healed. But late Saturday night, the 9th, Lem [...] Beebe and Jim Lane come to my house and told me all--told me [...] the whole awful 'sassination, and my heart was broke.

As observações geológicas suportam a divisão desta suíte nas seguintes unidades: Anfibolito Algodões - anfibolitos com e sem granada encontrados no distrito homônimo, município de Quixeramobim; Metassedimentos Choró - biotita-gnaisses finos com intercalações de quartzitos e metaconglomerados, aflorantes em tomo do Açude Choró Limão no município de Choró; e Ortognaisses Tonalíticos-Graníticos - corpos intrusivos nas unidades anteriores como stocks, diques e folhas. Os anfibolitos finos sem granada da SMAC foram interpretados como produtos ígneos básicos tholeiíticos. Estes exibem padrões aplainados dos elementos do grupo das terras raras (ETR's), anomalias negativas de Nb, Ta, e Th, e anomalia positiva de Sr em diagramas demulti-elementos. Nestas rochas foram obtidas uma idade isocrônica Sm-Nd rocha total de 2. 240 : 1 : 50 Ma, idades modelo de Nd (T DM) variando entre 2. 403 - 2. 257 Ma e valores positivos de EN_t= 2, 2 Ga). Modelagem petrogenética admite a derivação destas rochas de uma fonte mantélica empobrecida como a dos basaltos de cadeia meso-oceânica. Os metassedimentos Choró foram caracterizados como metagrauvacas feldspáticas, formadas a partir de detritos provenientes de rochas ígneas máficas e félsicas-intermediárias. O enriquecimento em Sc e Co em relação a La e Th apoiam esta derivação. Os padrões dos ETR' s são fracionados, sem proeminentes anomalias de Eu. Dados isotópicos indicam idades modelo (TDM) no intervalo 2. 449 - 2. 216 Ma e valores positivos de EN_t= 2, 2 Ga). Em geral, os ortognaisses tonalíticos-graníticos da SMAC apresentam natureza cálcio-alcalina, forte fracionamento entre os elementos LIL (large ions lithophile) e HFS (high field strength), valores positivos de eNd e razões iniciais de 87 Srl 6 Sr baixas (0, 7013 - 0, 7018). Nos ortognaisses tonalíticos de alta alumina de um stock aflorante no distrito de Algodões foi obtida uma idade U-Pb em grãos individuais de zircão de 2. 131 : 1 : 12 Ma, e idade PbPb evaporação de 2. 123 : 1 Abstract: This thesis proposes an {{interpretation}} of the tectonic evolution of the Algodoes-Choro Metamorphic Suite (ACMS) - a paragneiss-amphibolite association intruded by granite-tonalite orthogneisses that crops out in the central region of the Ceara State, NE Brazil. The geological data support the division of this suite in the following units: 1) Algodões amphibolite - garnet-bearing and garnet-free amphibolite found in the homonymous village of the Quixeramobim district; 2) Choro meta-sedimentary unit biotita-gneisses with quartzites and metaconglomerate horizons <b>croping</b> out around the Choro Limão dam; and 3) granite-tonalite orthogneisses - intrusive bodies into the older units as stocks, dikes and 'sheets. The fine grained garnet-free amphibolite of ACMS was interpreted as tholeiite lavas having flat chondrite-normalized rare earth element pattems (REE), and negative Nb- Ta anomalies and positive Sr anomaly on primitive mantle normalized multi-elements diagrams. These rocks yielded a whole-rock Sm-Nd age of 2, 24 O± 50 Ma with Nd model ages (TDM) varying between 2, 403 - 2, 257 Ma with positive ?Nd values. Petrogenetic modelling suggests the derivation of these rocks from a Depleted Morb Mantle source. The Choró meta-sedimentary unit was characterized as dominantly feldspar-rich metagraywackes made up of tragments of mafic and felsic-intermediate igneous rocks. The enrichment in Sc and Co relative to La and Th supports this assumption. The REE-pattems are tractionated without prominent Eu-anomalies. Isotopic data indicate Nd model ages (TDM) in the interval 2, 449 - 2, 216 Ma and positive eNd values. In general the granitetonalite orthogneisses of ACMS have a calc-alkaline geochemical signature, strong tractionation between the large ions lithophile and high field strenght elements, positive ?Nd values and low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr initial ratios (0, 7013 - 0, 7018). A small stock ofhigh-alumina tonalite orthogneiss located in the Algodoes village yielded a precise single grain zircon UPb age of 2, 131 :f: 12 Ma and single grain zircon Pb-Pb evaporation age of 2. 123 :f: 20 Ma. Similarly, a meta-andesite dike and a granitic sheet respectively yielded a poor single grain zircon U-Pb ages of 2. 137 :f: 34, 8 Ma and 2. 056 :f: 164 Ma, as well as a single grain zircon Pb-Pb evaporation ages of 2. 153 :f: 5 Ma and 21 O 7 :f: 16 Ma. Petrogenetic modelling admits the generation of the tonalite orthogneiss through partial melting of garnet-amphibolite. Structural data demonstrate that the tectonic units of the studied area, i. e., ACMS, Quixeramobim metapelitic unit and Quixadá-Quixeramobim Granitic Complex have their tectonic evolution significantly controlled by movements of the Sen. Pompeu, Quixeramobim, and Custo dia ductile shear zones. The c 1 ockwise kinematics characterized in the shear zones coupled with progressive change from mylonitic to regional scale foliation suggest that the structural evolution was largely achieved under transpressive conditions. However, the late stage of tectonic evolution was characterized by inversion of the transpressive regime to a transtensional one. Finally, it is suggested that the supracrustal sequence of ACMS was generated in a back-arc basin around 2, 24 Ga, followed by emplacement of tonalite-granite bodies between 2, 17 - 2, 05 Ga. As such, the AlgodoesChoro Metamorphic Suite constitutes a juvenile segment of the Transamazonian/Ebumean orogeny (ca. 2, 1 ± 0, 1 Ga). However taking into account the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages of the literature it is admitted that the above referred to units have been reworked between 580 Ma and 530 Ma, during the formation of Western Gondwan...|$|E
