5|$|If {{one is a}} materialist and {{believes}} that all aspects of our <b>common-sense</b> psychology will find reduction to a mature cognitive neuroscience, and that non-reductive materialism is mistaken, then one can adopt a final, more radical position: eliminative materialism.|$|E

Swift patterned his sermons on the plain style of the Book of Common Prayer and the Church of Ireland Authorized Version of the Bible.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, the same {{philosophers}} also claimed that <b>common-sense</b> mental states {{simply do not}} exist. But critics pointed out that eliminativists could not have it both ways: either mental states exist and will ultimately be {{explained in terms of}} lower-level neurophysiological processes or they do not. Modern eliminativists have much more clearly expressed the view that mental phenomena simply do not exist and will eventually be eliminated from people's thinking about the brain {{in the same way that}} demons have been eliminated from people's thinking about mental illness and psychopathology.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequently}} used argument in favour of dualism appeals to the <b>common-sense</b> intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what the mind is, the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self, their personality, their soul, or some other such entity. They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding {{the idea that there}} is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible. Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading and that we should use our critical faculties, along with empirical evidence from the sciences, to examine these assumptions to determine whether there is any real basis to them.|$|E
5|$|The head of {{the legal}} system was officially the pharaoh, who was {{responsible}} for enacting laws, delivering justice, and maintaining law and order, a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as Ma'at. Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a <b>common-sense</b> view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes. Local councils of elders, known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes. More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.|$|E
5|$|The series plot {{revolves}} around Sheriff Andy Taylor (Andy Griffith) {{and his life}} in sleepy, slow-paced fictional Mayberry, North Carolina. Sheriff Taylor's level-headed approach to law enforcement makes him the scourge of local moonshiners and out-of-town criminals, while his abilities to settle community problems with <b>common-sense</b> advice, mediation, and conciliation make him popular with his fellow citizens. His professional life, however, {{is complicated by the}} repeated gaffes of his inept deputy, Barney Fife (Don Knotts). Barney is portrayed as Andy's cousin in the first, second, and sixth episodes, but is never again referred to as such. Andy socializes with male friends in the Main Street barber shop and dates various ladies until a schoolteacher becomes his steady interest in season three. At home, Andy enjoys fishing trips with his son, Opie (Ronny Howard), and quiet evenings on the front porch with his maiden aunt and housekeeper, Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier). Opie tests his father's parenting skills season after season, and Aunt Bee's ill-considered romances and adventures cause her nephew concern.|$|E

25|$|Interactionism is {{the view}} that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, causally {{interact}} with physical states. This is a position which is very appealing to <b>common-sense</b> intuitions, notwithstanding {{the fact that it}} is very difficult to establish its validity or correctness by way of logical argumentation or empirical proof. It seems to appeal to <b>common-sense</b> because we are surrounded by such everyday occurrences as a child's touching a hot stove (physical event) which causes him to feel pain (mental event) and then yell and scream (physical event) which causes his parents to experience a sensation of fear and protectiveness (mental event) and so on.|$|E

25|$|Critical common-sensism, {{treated by}} Peirce as a {{consequence}} of his pragmatism, is his combination of Thomas Reid's <b>common-sense</b> philosophy with a fallibilism that recognizes that propositions of our more or less vague common sense now indubitable may later come into question, for example because of transformations of our world through science. It includes efforts to work up in tests genuine doubts for a core group of common indubitables that vary slowly if at all.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{equivalent}} ways of {{asserting that}} the universe is partially ordered: Assume either M1–M3, or that Proper Parthood is transitive and asymmetric, hence a strict partial order. Either axiomatization results in the system M. M2 rules out closed loops formed using Parthood, so that the part relation is well-founded. Sets are well-founded if the axiom of regularity is assumed. The literature contains occasional philosophical and <b>common-sense</b> objections to the transitivity of Parthood.|$|E

Its aim is the cultivation of a more wholesome and positive approach to life.|$|E
25|$|In epistemology, for example, the {{criticism}} of what Fodor calls the interpretationalist hypothesis accounts for the <b>common-sense</b> intuition (on which naïve physics is based) of the independence of reality from the conceptual categories of the experimenter. If the processes of elaboration of the mental modules are in fact independent of the background theories, then {{it is possible to}} maintain the realist view that two scientists who embrace two radically diverse theories see the world exactly in the same manner even if they interpret it differently. The point is {{that it is necessary to}} distinguish between observations and the perceptual fixation of beliefs. While it is beyond doubt that the second process involves the holistic relationship between beliefs, the first is largely independent of the background beliefs of individuals.|$|E
25|$|The {{editorial}} {{perspective of}} the corporate mass-media misrepresented intellectualism as a profession that is separate and apart from the jobs and occupations of regular folk. In presenting academically successful students as social failures, an undesirable social status for the average young man and young woman, corporate media established to the U.S. mainstream their opinion that the intellectualism of book-learning {{is a form of}} mental deviancy, thus, most people would shun intellectuals as friends, lest they risk social ridicule and ostracism. Hence, the popular acceptance of anti-intellectualism lead to populist rejection of the intelligentsia for resolving the problems of society. Moreover, in the book Inventing the Egghead: The Battle over Brainpower in American Culture (2013), Aaron Lecklider indicated that the contemporary ideological dismissal of the intelligentsia derived from the corporate media’s reactionary misrepresentations of intellectual men and women as lacking the <b>common-sense</b> of regular folk.|$|E
25|$|This is {{a parent}} {{education}} and psychotherapy intervention developed by Glen Cooper, Kent Hoffman, Robert Marvin, and Bert Powell designed to shift problematic or 'at risk' patterns of attachment – caregiving interactions {{to a more}} appropriate developmental pathway. It is stated that it is explicitly based on contemporary attachment and congruent developmental theories. Its core constructs are Ainsworth’s ideas of a Secure Base and a Haven of Safety (Ainsworth et al. 1978). The aim of the protocol is to present these ideas to the parents in a user-friendly, <b>common-sense</b> fashion that they can understand both cognitively and emotionally. This is done by a graphic representation of the child's needs and attachment system in circle form, summarising the child's needs and the safe haven provided by the caregiver. The protocol {{has so far been}} aimed at and tested on preschoolers up to the age of 4 years.|$|E
25|$|Although Kant never {{explicitly}} states {{what the}} first proposition is, {{it is clear that}} its content is suggested by the following <b>common-sense</b> observation. Common sense distinguishes among: (a) the case in which a person clearly acts contrary to duty; (b) the case in which a person’s actions coincide with duty, but are not motivated by duty; and (c) the case in which a person's actions coincide with duty because she is motivated by duty. Kant illustrates the distinction between (b) and (c) with the example of a shopkeeper (4:397) who chooses not to overcharge an inexperienced customer in order to preserve his business’s reputation. Because it is not motivated by duty, the shopkeeper's action has no moral worth. Kant contrasts the shopkeeper with the case of a person who, faced with “adversity and hopeless grief” (4:398) obeys his duty to preserve his life. Because this person acts from duty, his actions have moral worth. Kant thinks our actions only have moral worth and deserve esteem when they are motivated by duty.|$|E
25|$|In 1737 and 1738, Lady Mary {{published}} anonymously {{a political}} periodical called the Nonsense of <b>Common-Sense,</b> supporting the Robert Walpole government (the title was {{a reference to}} a journal of the liberal opposition entitled Common Sense). She wrote six Town Eclogues. She wrote notable letters describing her travels through Europe and the Ottoman Empire; these appeared after her death in three volumes. Lady Mary corresponded with Anne Wortley and wrote courtship letters to her future husband Edward Wortley Montagu, as well as love letters to Francesco Algarotti. She corresponded with notable writers, intellectuals and aristocrats of her day. She wrote gossip letters and letters berating the vagaries of fashionable people to her sister, Lady Mar, and exchanged intellectual letters with her adult daughter, Lady Bute. Although not published during her lifetime, her letters from Turkey were clearly intended for print. She revised them extensively and gave a transcript to the Rev. Benjamin Sowden in Rotterdam in 1761. During the twentieth century Lady Mary's letters were edited separately from her essays, poems and plays.|$|E
25|$|The {{observational}} method applied to consciousness {{gives us the}} science of psychology. This is the basis and the only proper basis of ontology or metaphysics, the science of being, and of the philosophy of history. To the observation of consciousness Cousin adds induction as the complement of his method, by which he means inference as to reality necessitated by the data of consciousness, and regulated by certain laws found in consciousness, those of reason. By his method of observation and induction as thus explained, his philosophy will be found to be marked off very clearly, {{on the one hand}} from the deductive construction of notions of an absolute system, as represented either by Schelling or Hegel, which Cousin regards as based simply on hypothesis and abstraction, illegitimately obtained; and on the other, from that of Kant, and in a sense, of Sir W. Hamilton, both of which in the view of Cousin are limited to psychology, and merely relative or phenomenal knowledge, and issue in scepticism so far as the great realities of ontology are concerned. What Cousin finds psychologically in the individual consciousness, he finds also spontaneously expressed in the common sense or universal experience of humanity. In fact, it is with him the function of philosophy to classify and explain universal convictions and beliefs; but <b>common-sense</b> is not with him philosophy, nor is it the instrument of philosophy; it is simply the material on which the philosophical method works, and in harmony with which its results must ultimately be found.|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} {{varieties}} of eliminative materialism, but all maintain that our <b>common-sense</b> [...] "folk psychology" [...] badly misrepresents {{the nature of}} some aspect of cognition. Eliminativists such as Patricia and Paul Churchland argue that while folk psychology treats cognition as fundamentally sentence-like, the non-linguistic vector/matrix model of neural network theory or connectionism {{will prove to be}} a much more accurate account of how the brain works.|$|E
500|$|Although she {{believed}} that rearing the family was a shared responsibility between men and women, Spafford was cautious in both her words and actions to not fully support or endorse the women's rights movements of the 1970s. In 1972, she stated, [...] "Anything that gets out of control becomes a hazard, whether it's fire, flood, or women's lib". She {{went on to say}} that [...] "we want to preserve the nobility, dignity, and femininity of women; there's a danger of some of that being lost. But I think we have too many <b>common-sense</b> women for that to happen." ...|$|E
500|$|Early eliminativists such as Rorty and Feyerabend often {{confused}} {{two different}} {{notions of the}} sort of elimination that the term [...] "eliminative materialism" [...] entailed. On the one hand, they [...] claimed, the cognitive sciences that will ultimately give people a correct account of the workings of the mind will not employ terms that refer to <b>common-sense</b> mental states like beliefs and desires; these states will not be part of the ontology of a mature cognitive science. But critics immediately countered that this view was indistinguishable from the identity theory of mind. Quine himself wondered what exactly was so eliminative about eliminative materialism after all: ...|$|E
500|$|Eliminative materialism (also called eliminativism) [...] is {{the claim}} that people's <b>common-sense</b> {{understanding}} of the mind (or folk psychology) is false and that certain classes of s that most people believe in do not exist. It is a materialist position {{in the philosophy of}} mind. Some supporters of eliminativism argue that no coherent neural basis will be found for many everyday psychological concepts such as belief or desire, since they are poorly defined. Rather, they argue that psychological concepts of behaviour and experience should be judged by how well they reduce to the biological level. Other versions entail the non-existence of conscious mental states such as pain and visual perceptions.|$|E
500|$|In August 1799, Archduke Charles {{received}} {{orders from}} his brother, the Emperor, {{to withdraw the}} Austrian army across the Rhine. [...] While Charles could see this to be unreasonable—Alexander Suvorov had not yet reached central Switzerland, and it was folly to think that Alexander Korsakov's force of 30,000 and Hotze's 20,000 could hold all of the region until {{the arrival of the}} rest of the Russian force—the order was emphatic. Charles delayed as long as he could, but in late August he withdrew his force across the Rhine and headed toward Phillipsburg. When Suvorov heard of this breach of military <b>common-sense,</b> he wondered [...] "the owl [...] has either gone out of his mind, or he never had one." [...] The order was eventually reversed too late for the Archduke to stop his withdrawal.|$|E
500|$|The {{question}} of morality plays {{a large role}} in The Monster, especially in terms of compassion and tolerance. Several critics have pointed to the novella's non-absolute stance on these themes, mainly in regard to Dr. Trescott's ethical dilemma in his devotion to Henry, a black man and his son's savior. As author Patrick Dooley points out, [...] "What is at stake in The Monster is that if Trescott is a moral man, Crane has rejected <b>common-sense</b> morality. If Trescott's actions are supererogative and saintly, however, he is to be applauded and admired, but the ordinary moral behavior of average people and the competence of everyday heroes will not have been expunged." [...] Crane scholar Stanley Wertheim also noted the duplicitous morality depicted by the town of Whilomville, which exhibits [...] "prejudice, fear and isolation in an environment traditionally associated with neighborliness and goodwill." ...|$|E

She remarked that she watches C-SPAN every day. Although she identified herself as an unnamed entertainer, she was recognized by the C-SPAN host, who subsequently questioned her about her 1992 support for independent presidential candidate Ross Perot. She said, [...] "When I heard him talk right in the beginning, I thought that he would bring some sort of <b>common-sense</b> business approach and also less partisanship, but then... I was completely disappointed like everyone else when he just kind of cut and run {{and no one knew}} exactly why... Maybe he couldn't have withstood all the investigation that goes on now".|$|E
500|$|The five {{classical}} planets, being {{visible to}} the naked eye, have been known since ancient times and have {{had a significant impact on}} mythology, religious cosmology, and ancient astronomy. In ancient times, astronomers noted how certain lights moved across the sky, as opposed to the [...] "fixed stars", which maintained a constant relative position in the sky. Ancient Greeks called these lights [...] ( [...] , [...] "wandering stars") or simply [...] ( [...] , [...] "wanderers"), from which today's word [...] "planet" [...] was derived. In ancient Greece, China, Babylon, and indeed all pre-modern civilizations, it was almost universally believed that Earth was the center of the Universe and that all the [...] "planets" [...] circled Earth. The reasons for this perception were that stars and planets appeared to revolve around Earth each day and the apparently <b>common-sense</b> perceptions that Earth was solid and stable and that it was not moving but at rest.|$|E
500|$|Dan Wakefield, in {{his review}} of the book in [...] "," [...] {{questioned}} Pressman's primarily critical description of Erhard's character. [...] Wakefield suggested {{that one of the}} reasons the press or [...] "media" [...] paints a negative view is because [...] "nobody in the media bothers to speak to the people who value in his programs." [...] Wakefield refers to a study done by opinion analyst Daniel Yankelovich in which [...] "seven out of ten participants in The Forum found it to be 'one of their life's most rewarding experiences,' while 94 percent felt the program had 'practical' and 'enduring' value." [...] While Pressman describes the est training as [...] "a mish-mash of self-help theories, <b>common-sense</b> psychology, and dime-store ideas of motivation," [...] Wakefield, who had experienced the est training personally states, [...] "If I was [...] "conned" [...] by that [...] "mish-mash" [...] when I did est in 1984, I'm grateful I was conned into losing the addiction to alcohol that had plagued me for a quarter of a century." ...|$|E
500|$|Eliminativism {{maintains}} that the <b>common-sense</b> understanding of the mind is mistaken, and that the neurosciences will one day reveal that the mental states that are talked about in everyday discourse, using words such as [...] "intend", [...] "believe", [...] "desire", and [...] "love", do not refer to anything real. Because of the inadequacy of natural languages, people mistakenly {{think that they have}} such beliefs and desires. Some eliminativists, such as Frank Jackson, claim that consciousness does not exist except as an epiphenomenon of brain function; others, such as Georges Rey, claim that the concept will eventually be eliminated as neuroscience progresses. Consciousness and folk psychology are separate issues and it is possible to take an eliminative stance on one but not the other. The roots of eliminativism go back to the writings of Wilfred Sellars, W.V. Quine, Paul Feyerabend, and Richard Rorty. The term [...] "eliminative materialism" [...] was first introduced by James Cornman in 1968 while describing a version of physicalism endorsed by Rorty. The later Ludwig Wittgenstein was also an important inspiration for eliminativism, particularly with his attack on [...] "private objects" [...] as [...] "grammatical fictions".|$|E
500|$|When police {{conduct a}} search, the {{amendment}} {{requires that the}} warrant establish probable cause {{to believe that the}} search will uncover criminal activity or contraband. They must have legally sufficient reasons to believe a search is necessary. In Carroll v. United States (1925), the Supreme Court stated that probable cause to search is a flexible, <b>common-sense</b> standard. To that end, the Court ruled in Dumbra v. United States (1925) that the term probable cause means [...] "less than evidence that would justify condemnation", reiterating Carrolls assertion that it merely requires that the facts available to the officer would [...] "warrant a man of reasonable caution" [...] in the belief that specific items may be contraband or stolen property or useful as evidence of a crime. It does not demand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false. A [...] "practical, non-technical" [...] probability that incriminating evidence is involved is all that is required. In Illinois v. Gates (1983), the Court ruled that the reliability of an informant is to be determined based on the [...] "totality of the circumstances." ...|$|E
500|$|The Workmans {{struggled}} with labor problems continually, needing local porters to carry gear {{for them because}} they could not carry a sufficient amount for themselves for a multi-month expedition. [...] They had to transport Mummery tents, eider sleeping bags, camera equipment, scientific instruments, and a large supply of food. The porters were skeptical of the entire venture. The locals rarely climbed mountains and were not used to taking orders from a woman, which made Fanny's position difficult. The Workmans tried to solve these problems with condescension and high-handedness. Kenneth Mason maintains in his history of Himalayan mountaineering, written in 1955, that [...] "The Workmans were, on their journeys, the victims of their own faults. They were too impatient and rarely tried to understand the mentality of the porters and so did not get the best out of them." [...] Labor problems beset all of their expeditions because, as Miller puts it, [...] "Almost alone of Victorian travellers, the Workmans had absolutely no sympathy or even <b>common-sense</b> understanding of the local people, into whose poor and remote villages they burst with trains of followers demanding service and supplies." [...] In her chapter on Workman, Miller argues that the couple, being American, did not have the same sense of caste or class that British explorers had: [...] "the Workmans, like most of their countrymen, plunged in their enterprises headlong, expecting their enormous energy to overcome all obstacles. They were justifiably criticized by the British for their callous, incompetent behavior toward the Indians." ...|$|E
500|$|Madhayamaka Buddhism goes even further, finding {{fault with}} the monist view of physicalist philosophies of mind {{as well in}} that these {{generally}} posit matter and energy as the fundamental substance of reality. [...] Nonetheless, this {{does not imply that}} the cartesian dualist view is correct, rather Madhyamaka regards as error any affirming view of a fundamental substance to reality.In denying the independent self-existence of all the phenomena that make up the world of our experience, the Madhyamaka view departs from both the substance dualism of Descartes and the substance monism—namely, physicalism—that is characteristic of modern science. The physicalism propounded by many contemporary scientists seems to assert that the real world is composed of physical things-in-themselves, while all mental phenomena are regarded as mere appearances, devoid of any reality in and of themselves. Much is made of this difference between appearances and reality.Indeed, physicalism or the idea that matter is the only fundamental substance of reality is explicitly rejected by Buddhism.In the Madhyamaka view, mental events are no more or less real than physical events. In terms of our <b>common-sense</b> experience, differences of kind do exist between physical and mental phenomena. While the former commonly have mass, location, velocity, shape, size, and numerous other physical attributes, these are not generally characteristic of mental phenomena. For example, we do not commonly conceive of the feeling of affection for another person as having mass or location. These physical attributes are no more appropriate to other mental events such as sadness, a recalled image from one’s childhood, the visual perception of a rose, or consciousness of any sort. Mental phenomena are, therefore, not regarded as being physical, {{for the simple reason that}} they lack many of the attributes that are uniquely characteristic of physical phenomena. Thus, Buddhism has never adopted the physicalist principle that regards only physical things as real.|$|E
