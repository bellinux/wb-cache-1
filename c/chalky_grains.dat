30|$|Appearance of <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> of both years {{showed some}} resemblance, and the {{high-temperature}} stress of 2010 remarkably extended the chalking of grain. Scanning electron microscopic observation showed that round-shaped starch granules with numerous small pits were loosely packed in the opaque {{part of the}} <b>chalky</b> <b>grains.</b> Proteomic analyzes of rice <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> revealed deregulations in the expression of multiple proteins implicated in diverse metabolic and physiological functions, such as protein synthesis, redox homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and starch biosynthesis and degradation. The glycomic profiling has shown slight differences in chain-length distributions of starches in the grains of 2009 -to- 2010. However, no significant changes were observed in the chain-length distributions between the translucent and opaque parts of perfect and <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> in both years. The glucose and soluble starch contents in opaque parts were increased by the high-temperature stress of 2010, though those in perfect grains were not different regardless of the environmental changes of 2009 -to- 2010.|$|E
30|$|Perfect and <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> of rice (cv. Koshihikari) were {{harvested}} at a paddy {{field of}} Sanjo city (Niigata, Japan) in 2009 and 2010. The average temperature of heading and ripening period of Koshihikari in 2010 (28.0  °C) was {{much higher than}} that in 2009 (24.4  °C). The 1, 000 -kernel weight of <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> in 2010 (15.61  g) was apparently small compared with the 2009 <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> (16.97  g), but {{a variation of the}} 1, 000 -kernel weight of the perfect grains in 2009 and 2010 (21.62 and 21.99  g, respectively) was indistinguishable. The volumes (length x width x thickness) of 2009 perfect, 2010 perfect, 2009 chalky, and 2010 <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> were 29.15, 28.73, 23.85 and 23.84  mm 3, respectively. Thus, the size of the chalky grain was smaller than that of the perfect grain, whereas {{there was no difference between}} the sizes in 2009 and 2010 <b>chalky</b> <b>grains.</b> The decrease in rice grain length and width might be related with the reduction in average endosperm cell area observed under high temperature (Morita et al. 2005). Consequently, it has been suggested that the flow of C and N to the grain (Mohammadi et al. 2010), and insufficient supply of photosynthates from source to sink organ and carbohydrate deficit (Liu et al. 2009; Kanno and Makino 2010; Shi et al. 2013) caused by increased temperature could be causes of chalkiness.|$|E
30|$|Together with {{previous}} {{findings on the}} increased expression of α-amylases in the endosperm, these results suggested that unusual starch degradation rather than starch synthesis is involved in occurring of <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> of rice under the high-temperature stress during grain filling period.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{object of}} this project was to study the effect of drying {{temperature}} on physical quality and sensory evaluation of germinated brown rice soaking with tumeric and roselle. The drying was run under the conditions of drying temperatures of 80 - 100 °C and air velocity of 7. 3 m/s. Initial moisture content of brown rice samples was of 54 - 55 % dry-basis and was dried until the final moisture content reached to 20 - 25 % dry-basis. After drying, the rice was tempered and then was ventilated by ambient air until its moisture content reached to 14 - 15 % dry-basis. The experiment showed that highest drying rate is incident at 100 °C. For physical qualities analysis, {{the results showed that}} the drying air temperature does not affect to head rice yield, fissured kernels, <b>chalky</b> <b>grain</b> and color (L*, a*, b * CIE-lab unit) of herbal germinated brown rice. In addition, herbal germinated brown rice drying can maintain low percentage of <b>chalky</b> <b>grain</b> compared to commercial brown rice. The soaking solution was not affect to drying rate. Finally, the sensory evaluation showed that the herbal germinated brown rice dried with all drying conditions was acceptable taste (> 5) ...|$|R
30|$|The chain-length {{distribution}} pattern of amylopectin in kernels from ozone-exposed “Koshihikari” {{was similar to}} that in kernels from SSIIIa-deficient rice mutants (Fujita et al. 2007). We accordingly evaluated SSIIIa expression in “Koshihikari” and “Kasalath” caryopses during the grain-filling period (Fig.  5). The transcript level of SSIIIa was decreased by ozone in “Koshihikari”, whereas no such decrease was detected in “Kasalath”. Previous studies showed that the ssIIIa mutants result in a chalky interior appearance in kernels and an irregular shape of starch granules caused by insufficient crystallization of starch (Fujita et al. 2007; Ryoo et al. 2007). Furthermore, the authors suggested that SSIIIa {{plays an important role in}} the elongation of long-B chains (DP[*]>[*] 30) connecting the amylopectin cluster. We thus propose that the chalky phenotype in ozone-exposed “Koshihikari” kernel is attributed to loosely packed starch granules, which is caused by the reduction of long chains of amylopectin resulting from the decrease in the expression of SSIIIa. On the other hand, “Kasalath” showed high percentage of <b>chalky</b> <b>grain</b> (Fig.  1), and the SSIIIa transcript levels in the cultivar were higher than those in “Koshihikari” with or without ozone exposure (Fig.  5). Xu et al. (2015) showed that Indica rice was inferior in the appearance quality compared with japonica rice regardless of their growth conditions, suggesting that the inherent high <b>chalky</b> <b>grain</b> in “Kasalath” is independent from the expression levels of SSIIIa. Although further studies, such as expression analysis of other genes involved in starch synthesis or metabolism, are needed to determine the role of SSIIIa on the alteration of starch structure under elevated ozone, our results indicate the presence of a novel mechanism of ozone-induced deterioration of the appearance quality in japonica rice.|$|R
40|$|Pathum Thani 1 (PTT 1) {{grown in}} Northern Thailand is often {{rejected}} by buyers {{on the basis}} of it poor quality, while it is a popular variety among farmers and rice mills in the Central region. This study evaluated head rice yield and chalkiness in dry season of PTT 1 from different regions of Thailand. Samples of dry season 2011 crop of PTT 1 were collected from the Upper North, Lower North, Central, East, and Northeast. Sixty-seven paddy samples were dehulled and milled individually. The milled rice of each sample was separated into head and broken rice to determine percentage of head rice. Percentage of chalkiness was determined by weight of <b>chalky</b> <b>grain,</b> in both whole and broken grain. The Central region had the highest percentage of chalkiness (49. 1 %) and head rice (46. 4 %), while the lowest percentage of head rice was found in rice from the Upper North (29. 8 %) and Northeast (26. 6 %). The lowest percentage chalkiness was found in samples from the Northeast (29. 5 %), Upper North (26. 0 %). The Lower north had percentage of head rice and chalkiness as well as Central. The negative correlation between percentage of head rice and chalkiness was found only in samples from the Northeast (r = - 0. 87, p < 0. 001), but not from the other regions. This suggests that the reason for grain breakage may be more complex than the lessening of milling resistance of <b>chalky</b> <b>grain.</b> These results verified the perception of rice buyers of the poorer quality of PTT 1 from the Upper North, but not necessarily from the Lower North. The basis for further studies of factors controlling rice milling quality is now established...|$|R
30|$|Global {{climate models}} predict an {{increase}} in global mean temperature and a higher frequency of intense heat spikes during this century. Cereals such as rice (Oryza sativa L.) {{are more susceptible to}} heat stress, mainly during the gametogenesis and flowering stages. During periods of high temperatures, grain filling often causes serious damage to the grain quality of rice and, therefore, yield losses. While the genes encoding enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism of <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> have been established, a significant knowledge gap exists in the proteomic and glycomic responses to warm temperatures in situ. Here, we studied the translucent and opaque characters of high temperature stressed <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> of 2009 and 2010 (ripening temperatures: 24.4 and 28.0  °C, respectively).|$|E
40|$|Global warming impairs {{grain filling}} in rice and reduces starch {{accumulation}} in the endosperm, leading to chalky-appearing grains, which damages their market value. We found previously that high temperature-induced expression of starch-lytic α-amylases during ripening {{is crucial for}} grain chalkiness. Because the rice genome carries at least eight functional α-amylase genes, identification of the α-amylase(s) that contribute most strongly {{to the production of}} <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> could accelerate efficient breeding. To identify α-amylase genes responsible for the production of <b>chalky</b> <b>grains,</b> we characterized the histological expression pattern of eight α-amylase genes and the influences of their overexpression on grain appearance and carbohydrate components through a series of experiments with transgenic rice plants. The promoter activity of most α-amylase genes was elevated to various extents at high temperature. Among them, the expression of Amy 1 A and Amy 3 C was induced in the internal, especially basal to dorsal, region of developing endosperm, whereas that of Amy 3 D was confined near the ventral aleurone. These regions coincided with the site of occurrence of chalkiness, which was in clear contrast to conventionally known expression patterns of the enzyme in the scutellum and aleurone during seed germination. Furthermore, overexpression of α-amylase genes, except for Amy 3 E, in developing endosperm produced various degrees of <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> without heat exposure, whereas that of Amy 3 E yielded normal translucent grains, {{as was the case in}} the vector control, even though Amy 3 E-overexpressing grains contained enhanced α-amylase activities. The weight of the <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> was decreased due to reduced amounts of starch, and microscopic observation of the chalky part of these grains revealed that their endosperm consisted of loosely packed round starch granules that had numerous pits on their surface, confirming the hydrolysis of the starch reserve by α-amylases. Moreover, the <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> contained increased amounts of soluble sugars including maltooligosaccharides at the expense of starch. The integrated analyses proposed that expression of Amy 1 A, Amy 3 C, and Amy 3 D at the specific regions of the developing endosperm could generate the chalkiness. This finding provides the fundamental knowledge to narrow down the targets for the development of high temperature-tolerant premium rice...|$|E
30|$|Global {{climate change}} {{is one of the}} most serious {{environmental}} threats we face today. Since the early 20 th century, the average surface temperature of the Earth has unusually increased by about 0.8  °C coupled with the rapid warming of 0.6  °C over the past three decades. Climate change is also projected to have significant impacts on crop production (IPCC 2013). In 80  % of the rice harvested areas in Japan climate variability was more important and the explanation is on account of temperature variability (Ray et al. 2015). For every 1  °C increase in temperature, there was a 6.6  % decrease in yield from the current values for early rice, 5.2  % for late rice, and 8.2  % for single-cropped rice (Defeng and Shaokai 1995). The abnormal high temperature during rice endosperm development and grain filling periods can change the chemical ingredients of rice caryopses such as starch and storage proteins and the contents of fatty acid, thus causing a decrease in grain yield, quality and, hence, price. The occurrence of <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> of rice is increased by high-temperature stress during grain filling (Nagato and Ebata 1965). Morita et al. (2016) showed that <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> of japonica cultivars have been produced under temperatures more than 26  °C during the grain-filling period. Daily mean air temperatures of 26  °C during grain filling are becoming frequent in Japan (Usui et al. 2014). Many research groups have studied morphological characteristics of <b>chalky</b> <b>grains,</b> showing that abnormal starch granules were loosely packed in the <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> (Evers and Juliano 1976; Tashiro and Wardlaw 1991; Kim et al. 2000; Lisle et al. 2000; Singh et al. 2003; Ishimaru et al. 2009). Kernels with chalky have a lower density of starch granules than do vitreous ones and are more prone to breakage during milling. The surface of round-shaped starch granules in <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> caused by high-temperature stress had small pits occasionally (Tashiro and Wardlaw 1991). It should be noted that the feature of change of granule surface was similar to that occurring during germination (Fuwa et al. 1977). The environmental temperature at the grain filling stage has been reported to influence the starch composition in rice grains (Asaoka et al. 1984; Inouchi et al. 2000; Lisle et al. 2000; Umemoto and Terashima 2002; Cheng et al. 2005; Yamakawa et al. 2007; Mitsui et al. 2016). High temperature caused a reduction in the amylose contents and changed the fine structure of amylopectin (Asaoka et al. 1984; Inouchi et al. 2000; Cheng et al. 2005), suggesting that the unusual expression of the starch synthesizing enzymes is a possible key factor causing the <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> of rice (Nishi et al. 2001; Tanaka et al. 2004). On the other hand, surface of the starch granules showed clear `erosion´ with multiple small pits suggesting an attack by α-amylases (Zakaria et al. 2002; Iwasawa et al. 2009); the suppression of α-amylase genes by RNA interference improved the appearance quality of rice grains ripened under heat stress (Hakata et al. 2012). However, the mechanism of grain chalkiness under high-temperature stress is considerably complicated and still remains poorly understood: a disorder of photosynthesis, translocation efficiency, source-sink relationship, and protein expression in ripening seeds may involve in such chalking mechanism. Many quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling grain appearance quality have been identified in populations derived from crosses between japonica cultivars (Tabata et al. 2007; Ebitani et al. 2008; Kobayashi et al. 2013; Ishimaru et al. 2016), between japonica and indica cultivars (He et al. 1999; Wan et al. 2005; Ishimaru et al. 2016), indica cultivars (Mei et al. 2013), and between O. sativa and O. glaberrima (Li et al. 2004). Therefore, understanding of the mechanisms of grain chalking is indispensable to develop a strategy for reducing the high rate of <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> under the likely scenario of global warming (Lin et al. 2014).|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} lodging of rice plants from 20 d after full heading to {{maturity}} on yield and grain quality were investigated with a hybrid rice combination Liangyoupeijiu and a japonica rice cultivar CY- 6. The results showed that, except for brown rice rate, almost all parameters for yield and grain quality including ratio of grain length to grain width, gelatinization temperature and gel consistency, were significantly influenced by lodging and thus deteriorated. Regression analysis suggested that, lodging one day earlier at the grain-filling stage could cause 2. 66 % to 2. 71 % of yield loss, 1. 8 to 2. 6 percentage points decrease of seed-setting rate, 0. 26 to 0. 32 g reduction of 1000 -grain weight, 0. 097 to 0. 155 percentage point decline of milled rice rate, {{as well as}} 0. 13 to 0. 27 percentage point increase of <b>chalky</b> <b>grain</b> rate, and 0. 021 to 0. 024 percentage point rise of protein content, and subsequently lower the eating quality...|$|R
30|$|Among various {{additional}} <b>chalky</b> <b>grain</b> stress-related proteins, {{the expression}} of prohibitin and DREPP 2 proteins were most remarkably increased under a high temperature -oCG 2010 - (Fig.  3 d). Moreover, a characteristic behavior of expression of prohibitin which may have multiple functions including mitochondrial chaperone activity (Tatsuta et al. 2005; Van Aken et al. 2009) was up-regulated in oCG 2010, while it was down-regulated under oCG 2009. To our knowledge, {{this study is the}} first to provide insights into the differential expression of prohibitin proteins in opaque chalky part collected from rice grains following heat stress season. Prohibitin have been shown to play central roles in cell cycle regulation, receptor-mediated signaling at the cell surface, aging, apoptosis, and plant development and senescence (Berger and Yaffe 1998; Coates et al. 1997; McClung et al. 1992, 1995; Nijtmans et al. 2002; Piper et al. 2002; Chen et al. 2005). Recent studies using muscovy ducks suggested changes in the abundance of the mitochondrial protein chaperone, prohibitin, into thermal tolerance related to energy metabolism (Zeng et al. 2013).|$|R
30|$|To {{evaluate}} the agronomic and rice quality traits, Huahui 938, B 5, three improved NILs and their derived hybrids from Quan 9311 A and Luohong 4 A were planted in a randomized complete block design with three replications at Wuhan, China, {{in the summer}} of 2015 under natural field conditions. Each plot consisted of three rows with 10 plants per row at a planting density of 16  cm between plants within a row and 20  cm between rows. The agronomic and rice quality traits were measured according to the standard evaluation system for rice (IRRI 2002). Five mature plants in the middle row were harvested for measurements. The agronomic traits evaluated included number of days to heading (DTH), plant height (PH), panicle length (PL), panicle number (PN), number of grains per panicle (NGP), fertility of the spikelet (FER), grain yield (GY), and 1000 -grain weight (GW). The harvested seeds were stored at room temperature for three months at 14  % moisture content. The following grain quality traits were tested: head rice rate (HR), ratio of grain length to width (L/W), <b>chalky</b> <b>grain</b> rate (CK), chalkiness degree (CD), amylose content (AC) and alkali spreading value (ASV).|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo select elite germplasms, 112 mutants {{derived from}} japonica rice {{cultivar}} Wuyujing 3 were evaluated. The yield components such as panicle number per square meter, grain number per panicle, and grain weight were measured. The quality traits such as percentage of <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> (PCG), brown rice yield (BRY), milled rice yield (MRY), degree of milling (DM), amylose content (AC), protein content (PC), and relationships among traits were inverstigated. Results showed that grain yield ranged from 2. 15 to 12. 49 t/hm 2 {{with a mean}} of 6. 4 t/hm 2 and number of grains per square meter contributed for 94. 64 % in grain yield variation. For quality traits, all rice mutants had short size (grain length ≤ 5. 5 mm) and bold shape (grain length to width ratio = 1. 10 – 2. 00). Most of rice mutants (87. 5 %) had PCG values below 20 %. All mutants had MRY values above 50 %, AC values below 20 %, and PC values below 10 %. Percentage of <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> was significantly negatively correlated with MRY and positively correlated with DM. BRY and MRY were significantly negatively correlated with DM. PC was significantly and positively correlated with MRY and negatively correlated with DM, while AC had no significant correlation with these quality traits. It was concluded that there were 25 rice mutants which fulfilled the major requirements of Jiangsu standard japonica rice such as low percentage of <b>chalky</b> <b>grains,</b> low amylose content, optimal protein content, and which could be used as elite germplasms. Thus the mutants identified may lead to significant progress in improvement of rice quality...|$|E
30|$|In this study, {{the higher}} {{coverage}} of rice grains proteome by the iTRAQ/Shotgun strategy offered {{a good opportunity}} to discover more stress-related proteins involved in chalkiness tissue. Under field conditions, the differentially expressed proteins in opaque <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> under moderate (2009) and heat stress (2010) suggest three highly enriched functional terms, i.e. LEA proteins, HSPs, and glutathione peroxidase and S-transferase. These analyzes give us a better understanding about the chalky dynamics with global-mean warming of roughly 4  °C in rice grains. Furthermore, the formation of chalky grain under high-temperature season is also triggered by alterations in proteins associated with carbohydrate metabolism and starch structure. Thus, down-regulation of genes involved in starch biosynthesis and the involvement of α-amylase isoforms in the central opaque area of <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> were elucidated under elevated temperature. Our results provide new insights into proteome and glycome characterization in perfect and chalky grain in high-temperature scenarios at the field. The proteins identified here provide a basis to elucidate further the molecular mechanisms underlying the chalkiness under elevated temperature and may reveal useful targets in climate change scenarios studies and strategies.|$|E
30|$|E-[CO 2] {{significantly}} reduced grain appearance quality {{by increasing the}} percentage of <b>chalky</b> <b>grains,</b> as was reported in a previous FACE experiment in China (Yang et al. [2007]). Here, we showed {{that the effect of}} E-[CO 2] on grain appearance differed widely among cultivars, and that newly developed heat-tolerant cultivars retained high quality under E-[CO 2].

30|$|Rice {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} food crops, and fed more than half of the population in the world. In recent years, with the increase of living standard, more and more attention has been paid on rice quality, including the appearance quality, processing quality, nutritional quality, and cooking and eating quality, etc. Chalkiness is an important indicator of the appearance quality for rice. As the opaque part in endosperm, it is an optical character caused by the air-gap of loose arrangement between proteinoplast and amyloplast. Chalkiness can be evaluated by indexes, including area of chalky endosperm (ACE), degree of chalky endosperm (DCE) and percentage of grains with chalkiness (PGWC) when it is associated with high level of damage to the kernel during milling, and thus to a reduction in head rice recovery (Del Rosario et al. 1968). Furthermore, when <b>chalky</b> <b>grain</b> is steamed or boiled, cracks develop readily, reducing the palatability of the cooked product (Nagato and Ebata 1959; Cheng et al. 2005). Therefore, clarification of the heredity of chalkiness and its molecular mechanisms is of important significance to reduce the chalkiness, improve the appearance quality and the commercial value of rice (Tan et al. 2000).|$|R
30|$|Elevated ozone {{concentrations}} {{reduce the}} growth and yield of crop plants, including rice (Oryza sativa L.), {{which is the most}} important food crop in Asia (Kobayashi et al. 1995; Yonekura et al. 2005; Sawada and Kohno 2009). It is becoming clear that ozone influences not only grain yield but also grain quality of rice by increasing protein and reducing starch concentrations and absolute amounts of nutrient elements (Frei et al. 2012; Huang et al. 2012; Zheng et al. 2013). Moreover, elevated ozone increases the proportion of <b>chalky</b> <b>grain,</b> which is undesirable to the majority of consumers in the Far East (Wang et al. 2012, 2014). Wang et al. (2012) pointed out that the premature senescence of rice under ozone stress will conduce to incomplete filling of kernels, resulting in more kernels with a chalky appearance. However, the biochemical mechanisms responsible for ozone-induced changes in the components or appearance quality of rice kernels are poorly understood. It is noteworthy that deterioration in the grain quality occurs at a relatively low ozone level, even one not sufficient to reduce grain yield. Thus, impairment of rice grain quality by elevation of tropospheric ozone concentration is of greater concern than a decline in rice yield, especially in East Asia.|$|R
40|$|A pot {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} {{study the effects of}} different nitrogen application time (during the tillering or the booting stages) with the same nitrogen rates on the caryopsis development and grain quality of rice variety Yangdao 6. The increased nitrogen fertilizer (urea), especially applied during the booting stage, could evidently increase the milled rice rate, head rice rate and protein content in rice grains compared with the control (no nitrogen application), and decrease <b>chalky</b> <b>grain</b> rate and amylose content. Moreover, the increased nitrogen fertilizer significantly affected the caryopsis development and enhanced the grain weight when nitrogen applied during the tillering and the booting stages, especially during the booting stage. During caryopsis development the increased nitrogen fertilizer applied during the tillering and booting stages could obviously decrease the total starch and amylose contents, but not obviously for the amylopectin content in rice grain. Increased topdressing of nitrogen fertilizer, especially applied during the booting stage, had significant effect on the development and structures of amyloplasts and proteinoplasts. That is, it could change the distribution, number and shape of amyloplasts and proteinoplasts in the endosperm cells especially in grain abdomen. Compared with the control the arrangements of amyloplasts and proteinoplasts were closer, with more numbers, higher density and less interspaces each ohter. Furthermore, most amyloplasts showed polyhedron under the increased nitrogen fertilizer level...|$|R
30|$|For {{analyzing}} {{changes in}} the proteome and glycome of grains, the translucent and opaque parts of <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> and the central parts of perfect grains were prepared as follows: central part of perfect grain in 2009 (PG 2009), translucent part of chalky grain in 2009 (tCG 2009), opaque part of chalky grain in 2009 (oCG 2009), central part of perfect grain in 2010 (PG 2010), translucent part of chalky grain in 2010 (tCG 2010), and opaque part of chalky grain in 2010 (oCG 2010).|$|E
30|$|Noteworthy, {{high-temperature}} {{stress can}} lead {{to changes in the}} other proteins involved in lipid (Fig.  2 b, Additional file 1 : Table S 1) and glycolysis metabolic processes (Fig.  2 b), suggesting that primary metabolism might have been inhibited in <b>chalky</b> <b>grains.</b> Indeed, we found the lipid metabolism-related proteins, caleosin and sterol carrier protein, were differentially expressed in oCG, which may aid the mechanisms of chalkiness formation. The down-regulation of these proteins might retard the metabolic speed of fatty acid synthesis, under high-temperature conditions, in <b>chalky</b> <b>grains.</b> Because caleosin is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and/or oil bodies (OBs) in seed embryo development (Næsted et al. 2000), promotes specific interaction of OBs with vacuoles and facilitates access to triacylglycerides, to serve as energy source, by lipases (Poxleitner et al. 2006). Likewise, sterol carrier protein, peroxisomal lipid protein, might affect the transfer of lipids between membranes, β-oxidation and glyoxylate pathways, and hence the normal development and morphology of grains (Zheng et al. 2008). Thus, down-regulation of lipid metabolism related proteins probably contribute to the chalkiness formation in grains of 2009 -to- 2010. Further detailed investigations, including lipid profiling may provide us with additional clues to the biological function of those proteins in chalkiness formation.|$|E

Additionally, all three hybrids derived from Quan 9311 A had a better rice quality with a significantly lower <b>chalky</b> <b>grain</b> rate (CK). Compared to Fengliangyou 4, a popular and outstanding hybrid variety in agricultural production, the hybrid Luohong 4 A/HB 13002 - 9 - 7 showed similar GY but shorter DTH and lower PH. Meanwhile, the hybrid Quan 9311 A/HB 13002 - 9 - 7 had a significantly higher GY and lower CK compared with Fengliangyou 4 (Table  1). The BPH-resistant NILs and hybrids, which were identical to the recurrent parent and its derived hybrids with respect to the agronomic and rice quality traits, are more strongly desired.|$|R

We conducted 2 experiments, including a year-round experiment and collection of samples from different districts for building different temperature conditions. We analyzed the correlation between rising temperature and rice yield or quality. In our results, the critical period of temperature effect is 0 – 15  days after heading (H 15). The threshold of high temperature damage in yield and appearance quality was 25 – 27  °C. Grain weight decreased about 2 – 6 %, while the temperature of H 15 was raised 1  °C above the thresholds. Perfect <b>grain</b> ratio and <b>chalky</b> <b>grain</b> ratio decreased and increased, respectively, while the temperature of H 15 was raised above the thresholds. However, the high temperature in H 15 affected the physicochemical characteristics. In addition, we found positive correlation between grain length to width ratio and perfect grain ratio. Grain length to width ratio could be an index of temperature effects for grain quality. In our study, when the temperature was below 30  °C, a rising temperature of H 15 could damage rice yield and appearance quality, and change grain shape.

Grain chalk is an important indicator of rice quality evaluation and a highly undesirable quality trait in marketing and consumption of the rice grain (Li et al. 2014 b). As a polygenic quantitative trait with complex inheritance pattern, chalkiness is highly influenced by the environment. Thus the genetic basis of grain chalkiness is still poorly understood, even though many QTLs for chalkiness or related components have also been identified ([URL] Peng et al. (2014) mapped multiple QTLs associated with six chalkiness traits (chalkiness rate, white core rate, white belly rate, chalkiness area, white core area, and white belly area) using five populations and suggested {{that most of the}} QTLs clustered together and could be detected in different backgrounds. Two loci controlling PGWC were mapped by Zhou et al. (2009), and the qPGWC- 7 was narrowed to a 44 -kb region. Chalk 5, regulating grain chalkiness was isolated by Li et al. (2014 b), which encodes a vacuolar H+-translocating pyrophosphatase (V-PPase) with PPi hydrolysis and H+-translocation activity. Elevated expression of Chalk 5 increases chalkiness of the endosperm by disturbing the pH homeostasis in the endomembrane trafficking system in developing seeds, which affects the biogenesis of protein bodies coupled with a great increase in small vesicle-like structures, thus forming air spaces among endosperm storage substances, resulting in <b>chalky</b> <b>grain</b> (Li et al. 2014 b). However, the regulation pathway and interaction mechanisms of rice chalkiness associated genes remain unclear.|$|R
30|$|Other {{types of}} <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> were also {{increased}} by E-[CO 2]: {{the percentage of}} milky-white grains was 3.6 % in AMB and 5.3 % in FACE (P <[*] 0.05, Table  2), and that of white-belly grains was 2.2 % in AMB and 3.2 % in FACE (P <[*] 0.05), with highly significant cultivar differences (P <[*] 0.001). The [CO 2][*]×[*]cultivar group interaction was significant for white-belly grains (P <[*] 0.05), whereas the CO 2 [*]×[*]HT cultivar interaction was not significant, but the magnitudes of the E-[CO 2] effect and the interaction with cultivars were much smaller than in WBBG.|$|E
30|$|High {{temperatures}} during {{grain filling}} often cause serious {{damage to the}} grain quality of rice (Oryza sativa L.) (Terashima et al. [2001]; Lanning et al. [2011]; Kondo et al. [2012]), reducing the proportion of first-grade rice (Hasegawa et al. [2009]) or milling quality (Lyman et al. [2013]). One {{of the main reasons}} for the reduction is the decreased percentage of undamaged grains, which is due to increased proportions of chalky and unfilled grains. The occurrence of <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> under high temperatures is attributable mainly to the inhibition of starch accumulation (Morita [2008]; Morita and Nakano [2011]).|$|E
40|$|Recent proteomic {{analyses}} revealed dynamic changes of metabolisms during rice grain development. Interestingly, proteins involved in glycolysis, citric acid cycle, lipid metabolism, and proteolysis were accumulated {{at higher levels}} in mature grain than those of developing stages. High temperature (HT) stress in rice ripening period causes damaged (<b>chalky)</b> <b>grains</b> which have loosely packed round shape starch granules. The HT stress response on protein expression is complicated, and the molecular mechanism of the chalking of grain is obscure yet. Here, the current state on the proteomics research of rice grain grown under HT stress is briefly overviewed...|$|E
30|$|Proteomic {{information}} of rice grains in the anthesis, ripening, and maturing stages under heat stress has been gradually accumulated. The anthesis and early ripening stages {{are known to}} be highly sensitive to heat stress. Gel-based proteomic analyzes of different genotype anthers prepared from rice plants treated with high (38  °C) and control (29  °C) temperature at anthesis were carried out (Jagadish et al. 2008). Both cold (19  kDa) and heat (24  kDa) shock proteins were significantly up-regulated in a heat-tolerant genotype N 22, these possibly contributing to the greater heat tolerance of N 22. Heat stress (35 / 30  °C day/night) during an early stage of caryopsis development reduced the expression of starch granule-bound starch synthase (Wx) and prolamin, but enhanced the expression of dnaK-type hsp 70 and glutelins in comparison with those in control temperature (30 / 25  °C) (Lin et al. 2005). In addition, heat stress response of several different cultivars including high-chalky types were analyzed, the results showing that sHSP was positively correlated with the appearance of chalky kernels (Lin et al. 2005). In recent studies, accumulation of all classes of storage proteins was increased at early filling stage under heat stress (35 / 30  °C), whereas the prolamin accumulation was decreased at maturation and desiccation stages (Lin et al. 2010). On the other hand, Lin et al. (2014) showed that up-regulation of proteins involved in starch accumulation and down-regulation of ER proteins, PDIL 2 – 3 and BiP, were observed in the chalky tissue of notched-belly mutant appeared regardless of the environmental stress, employing a comparative proteomic analysis by iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification). Understanding protein expression patterns and its respective posttranslational modifications in <b>chalky</b> <b>grain</b> is of fundamental importance for targeting rice quality under temperatures variability.|$|R

Our results provide a comprehensive view of proteome and glycomic characterization under temperature variability. We consider which proteins, possibly, involved in the grain chalking under the paddy field conditions.|$|R
40|$|Even though normal maize has {{approximately}} 10 % protein, this is {{not available}} to monogastric animals, including humans because the protein is low in two essenyial amino acids, Iysine and tryptophan. As a result {{there has been a}} worldwide effort to develop maize with improved quality protein. Efforts to develop a more nutritionally improved maize began in 1963 with the discovery of a recessive mutant maize gene, with protein that was twice as nutritious as the one in ordinary maize. Early attempts to breed varieties with high protein quality met with several problems including low grain yield potential, unacceptable <b>chalky</b> <b>grain</b> type, high moisture at harvest, and high susceptibility to insect pests and diseases. Extensive research efforts at CIMMYT, Mexico have resulted in a quality protein maize (QPM) germplasm that has grain yield potential and agronomic characteristics similar to normal maize. The availability of QPM, and financial support from Sasakawa Global: 2000, enabled the national maize programme at the Crops Research Institute (CRI) of Ghana to intensify research into, and development of varieties that performed as well as, or better than, normal maize varieties. The result was the development of a QPM variety which has been designated as Obatanpa. Obatanpa has been extensively tested both on-station and on farmers' fields in Ghana. The results of the evaluations show that even though Obatanpa is an intermediate variety, it competes favourably with the released full season varieties in terms of grain yield. In the intermediate variety trials, again both on-station and on farmers' fields Obatanpa produced grain yield equal to or better than those of intermediate maturing varieties. An analysis of protein quality carried out at CIMMYT showed that both Obatanpa and Okomasa (a full-season variety) have about 10 % protein. However, the tryptophan level of Obatanpa, expressed as a percentage of whole sample or protein content, was about twice that of Okomasa. This was true for both the whole grain and the endosperm. Based on the encouraging performance of Obatanpa, a restricted release of the variety has been made in Ghana.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to propose a model for explaining rice responses to a wide range of N application rates in various growth attributes associated with the occurrence of <b>chalky</b> <b>grains.</b> We improved the sub-model for N uptake process of a previous rice model which was originally developed for explaining genotypic and environmental variations in the whole growth processes, considering the difference in the rate of N loss from the plant-soil system between indigenously supplied soil mineral N and fertilizer N. A total of 80 growth datasets of cultivar ‘Koshihikari’ grown at Shiga prefecture, Japan, in 2010 was utilized for the calibration and validation of the model. The rice growth model well explained the above-ground biomass growth (RMSD =  78. 7  g m− 2) and rough dry grain yield (RMSD =  83. 2  g m− 2) for the validation data-set, simultaneously. The simulated carbohydrate content available per single spikelet was negatively correlated with the observed percentage of the milky-white grain which includes white-cored grain (r = −. 77, p < . 001) for all the data-sets of calibration and validation. On the other hand, the observed percentage of the sum of white-back and white-base grains was closely correlated with the simulated plant N content available per single spikelet (r = −. 59, p < . 001). It was suggested that the present rice growth model would rationally explain the effects of N application on the occurrence of the <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> through the dynamic change of the carbohydrate content and plant N content available per single spikelet...|$|E
30|$|The {{mechanism}} of the reduction in undamaged grains under E-[CO 2] is not understood, but a possible mechanism is a higher canopy temperature in E-[CO 2] than in ambient [CO 2] (AMB) conditions, which was observed in a free-air CO 2 enrichment (FACE) study (Yoshimoto et al. [2005]). If higher canopy temperature due to E-[CO 2] {{is the main reason}} for the reduced grain appearance quality, heat-tolerant cultivars might also be resistant to the occurrence of <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> under E-[CO 2], but this hypothesis has never been tested. Therefore, we conducted a FACE experiment using several rice cultivars to determine whether heat-tolerant cultivars could maintain high grain quality under E-[CO 2].|$|E
30|$|As to the {{possible}} mechanisms explaining the high content of <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> in 2010, {{it is worth}} {{to note that the}} levels of some glutathione redox isoforms in oCG 2010 were, all of them, higher than oCG 2009 (Fig.  3 c). Glutathione, implicated in the antioxidant defense through the ascorbate/GSH cycle, {{plays a key role in}} maintaining the homeostasis of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are ubiquitous enzymes encoded by a large family of genes, which play an important role in cellular detoxification to a wide variety of endobiotic and xenobiotic substrates by conjugating the tripeptide glutathione. GSTs have been found to be differentially regulated by dehydration (Bianchi et al. 2002). However, antioxidant systems cannot completely prevent the deleterious effects of ROS. In this study, nine of the identified proteins are implicated in redox homeostasis-related functions in <b>chalky</b> <b>grains,</b> including glutathione transferase (GT), GSTs and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). Therefore, this would indicate that the ROS scavenging system may be activated in rice chalky kernels to alleviate such oxidative damage and to enhance high-temperature tolerance, mostly in 2010. Two proteins, GPX and GST, which are involved in the glutathione-ascorbate cycle for removing H 2 O 2, showed the same expression patterns (Figs.  3 c). GST and GPX can reduce H 2 O 2 to its corresponding hydroxyl compounds to remediate oxidative membrane damage, and their expression showed the increases in abundance in chalky tissues. Some of these proteins were consistent with those observed in the rice (Lin et al. 2014) and maize (Luo et al. 2010) in response to stress in developing kernel tissues. Thus, our results, in conjunction with those previously reported (Liu et al. 2010; 2011; Lin et al. 2014), show that the up-regulation of these proteins, more pronounced in high-temperature conditions, suggest a close relation between redox homeostasis and the enhancement of <b>chalky</b> <b>grains</b> frequency. Recent investigation revealed that a heat-tolerant cultivar of rice exhibits a characteristic high expression of superoxide dismutase MSD 1. In addition, the grain quality of transgenic overexpressor plants with the maize Ubiquitin- 1 promoter fused to MSD 1 was significantly improved in comparison with the wild type under heat stress after heading (Shiraya et al. 2015). We infer that the timely enhancement of H 2 O 2 level by MSD 1 under high-temperature stress is probably important, which acts as a signal that rapidly can promote the expression of stress-response proteins (Shiraya et al. 2015; Mitsui et al. 2016).|$|E

The following rice grain quality traits were tested by dehulled seeds of LuoYang 69 and 93 – 11 : brown rice ratio (BR, grains with the inedible outer hull removed), head rice ratio (HR, unbroken and broken translucent grains with at least 3 / 4 of a whole <b>grain),</b> <b>chalky</b> rice ratio (CR, grain with an opaque, chalky appearance covering half {{or more of the}} body of the grain), chalkiness degree (CD), amylose content (AC), alkali spreading value (ASV), grain length (GL), and ratio of grain length to width (L/W). The assessment criterion of rice grain quality followed the national standard GB/T 17891 – 1999 and NY/T 593 – 2013. The test of rice grain quality was performed at Institute of Food Crops, Hubei Academy of Agricultural Sciences (Wuhan, China).|$|R
30|$|Shading limits photosynthetically active {{radiation}} (PAR) and can be {{a source}} of plant stress. Several studies have assessed the effect of shading on growth and yield in cereal crops including rice; shading during flowering and grain development has been consistently found to decrease yield (e.g. Beed et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2006; Liu and Tollenaar, 2009; Deng et al., 2009). Zhang et al. (2007) found that shading affects quality traits in rice, and generally, shading resulted in increased grain protein content and decreased amylose content, as well as an increased rate of <b>chalky</b> rice <b>grains</b> and a greater average degree of chalkinesss. In this study, during the whole (S 1), early (S 2), or late (S 3) grain filling period, shading treatment resulted in significantly decreased yield in two elite Chinese fragrant rice varieties, with S 1 treatment resulting in the greatest yield losses. Yield losses were more substantial in Yuxiangyouzhan than Nongxiang 18 under all shading treatments; this is consistent with previous studies in which genotype has been found to influence yield loss due to shading in rice (Zhu et al., 2008; Deng et al., 2009). Shading treatment also significantly affected quality traits. An increase in grain protein content under all treatments and a consistent effect of treatment on grain chalkiness were observed for both varieties. Significant shading effects were also identified for most other quality traits assessed, however these varied with timing, duration of treatment, and cultivar. Together, these results are largely consistent with previous literature and confirm that shading during grain development can have a substantial effect on grain yield and quality in fragrant rice.|$|R

Results obtained from representative samples from plots on which there was no lodging effect were used as control. The experimental material was produced in Kochani region, on the experimental plots of Goce Delchev University - Shtip, Faculty of Agriculture, Rice Institute during 2014 and 2015.
