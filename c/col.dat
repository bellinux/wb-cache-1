40|$|Cut-Off Lows (<b>COLs)</b> are {{certainly}} amongst {{the most important}} synoptic-scale rain producing weather systems in South Africa. Rainfall associated with <b>COLs</b> is usually widespread, while about 20 % of <b>COLs</b> are associated with heavy rainfall. Both these attributes of rainfall associated with <b>COLs</b> are important to agriculture. Widespread rainfall secures good grazing potential, while heavy rainfall not only contributes largely to maintaining dam levels that are needed for irrigation, but also to flooding and erosion. Agriculture in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa is predominantly rain-fed, while agricultural activities that depend on irrigation are mostly located along the western coastal belt of the province. Despite {{of the fact that}} all <b>COLs</b> do not pass directly over the Eastern Cape Province, most of them appear to have a direct or indirect influence on the rainfall of the province, and in turn, impact on agricultural production and even the economy. In this study, the contribution of <b>COLs</b> to rainfall over the Eastern Cape Province is investigated. In order to achieve this, a climatology of <b>COLs</b> for the period 1979 to 2009 (31 years) was constructed by utilizing the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis data to create 6 -hourly contour images of geopotential heights and air-temperatures at the 500 hPa pressure level. All <b>COLs</b> that occurred over South Africa bounded by 200 S to 400 S and 00 E to 500 E from the day they started (at the formation of a closed low pressure system) until the day they ended (at the disappearance of the closed low pressure system), and that were cold cored, were considered as potential <b>COLs</b> in this study. In addition, low level circulation maps obtained from the South African Weather Service’s (SAWS’s) daily weather bulletins were used to ensure that the defined <b>COLs</b> were indeed extending from the 500 hPa pressure level to the land surface. Daily rainfall totals from 22 well-distributed weather stations over the Eastern Cape Province were used to determine the contribution of <b>COLs</b> to the rainfall over the province. It was found that 64 % of <b>COLs</b> that lasted for more than 24 -hours over the study domain had an influence on the total rainfall over the Eastern Cape Province. Monthly frequency distribution of <b>COLs</b> reveal that April and May had the highest occurrences, while December and January have the least occurrence. Long-term seasonal frequencies distributions of <b>COLs</b> show the highest occurrence during March-April-May (MAM) with the least occurrences during December-January-February (DJF). Most <b>COLs</b> lasted for 2 - 4 days over South Africa and the Eastern Cape Province for the study period of 31 -years. The contribution of rainfall associated with the occurrence of <b>COLs</b> is found to be approximate 37 - 38 % annually along the coastal areas, while it is less than 10 % annually over the interior of the Eastern Cape Province.

SUJEITOS E MÉTODOS: Para tanto, avaliaram-se 51 meninas entre 10 e 17 anos, sendo mensuradas as seguintes variáveis: massa corporal, estatura, massa gorda (absoluta e percentual) e massa magra (absoluta e percentual), bem como os valores do consumo de VO 2 e produção de VCO 2 que foram substituídos na equação de Weir (1949) considerada, neste estudo, como método padrão da TMR.

SUBJECTS AND METHODs: The following anthropometric variables were measured: body weight, stature, body fat mass (absolute and percentage), body lean mass (absolute and percentage) as well as the consumption ofVO 2 and production ofVCO 2 that were substituted in Weir's (1949) equation which was considered the RMR standard method in this study. The following statistical procedures were carried out: paired t-test (p < 0. 05); constant error (CE) with a less than 5 % difference and Bland and Altman's (1986) graphical analysis. RESULTS: The equations proposed by Tverskaya and <b>cols.</b> (1998) and Müller and <b>cols.</b> (2004) were the only equations that presented significant differences between the averages. However, only the equations proposed by Henry and Rees (1991) and Molnár and <b>cols.</b> (1995) produced a constant error of less than 5 %. However, Bland and Altman's (1986) graphical analysis showed that independently of the equation there is no agreement between the equations and the standard method.
