40|$|Whilst {{academics}} are at {{the centre}} of the curriculum design process, faculty academic quality (AQ) teams {{are at the}} centre of - and are critically important to - the <b>approval</b> <b>process.</b> AQ teams are singularly responsible for administrating and managing the curriculum <b>approval</b> <b>process</b> and therefore have responsibility for tracking, providing on-going feedback, controlling the status of proposals, assigning proposals for academic review, etc. Administering this functionality exposes AQ teams to an extra layer of C-CAP functionality. The back-end administration of the curriculum <b>approval</b> <b>process</b> via C-CAP is therefore mediated at a faculty level by AQ staff and is best understood, not through process diagrams, but by a star-shaped interpretation of faculty level <b>approval</b> <b>processes.</b> AQ teams govern or mediate key decision points during the <b>approval</b> <b>process.</b> Their centrality to the <b>approval</b> <b>process</b> and their influence on curriculum design (via academics) is such that they are the stakeholders above all others who interact with C-CAP the most and are the most exposed to its functionality and benefits. AQ teams are therefore at {{the centre of the}} star in Figure 1, {{which is part of the}} wider process surrounding curriculum design and approval. AQ teams were always central to faculty level <b>approval</b> <b>processes</b> but this centrality was never formalised in the previous state (i. e. before C-CAP) and, as a consequence, the <b>approval</b> <b>process</b> remained mysterious to many stakeholders. The development of C-CAP has changed this by making explicit a curriculum <b>approval</b> <b>process</b> that was hitherto mythic and plagued by tacit practice. This document provides guidance on using the C-CAP administration dashboard, the underlying approval workflows and also makes recommendations on how best to use C-CAP during the <b>approval</b> <b>process</b> and during Academic Committee. It should also be remembered that C-CAP covers only the curriculum design and approval process; there are a great many “off-line” processes and activities that AQ and faculty officers must undertake to ensure the successful delivery of a new class or course...|$|R

This report is on “Credit Process and Risk Management” of Standard Chartered Bank. This report is intended to assist the reader in detailed understanding the credit risk management process. It also attempts to capture the procedures practiced in Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) in relation to credit handling.

40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Business Administration, 2012. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 67). The report aims at identifying the positive aspects {{as well as the}} shortcomings of the entire process of credit approval and the credit risk assessment system of Standard Chartered Bank along with a descriptive analysis of the level of satisfaction of the clients of regarding the services and solutions offered to them by the Local Corporate segment of the bank. Incorporating the survey results with the outcome of the thorough analysis of the credit approval and credit risk assessment process of the clients is a major focus. It has been found that, the credit approval procedure of Standard Chartered Bank is divided into segments and disseminated to particular divisions with expertise in specialized fields to ensure that the whole process is flawless. Before providing the final approval, all the available information regarding clients‟ financials goes through extensive scrutiny. Prospecting and initiation, giving early business alert, obtaining CIB report and indicative offer letter, BCA preparation and approval, renewal, maintenance and monitoring of credit applications, preparation of operational sheet, BFL acceptance, security documentation, limit setup and facility drawdown are the stages of the <b>credit</b> <b>approval</b> <b>process.</b> In order to conduct the survey, structured questionnaire were mailed to 40 clients. The aim was to identify the level of knowledge regarding the services, views regarding their quality and standard and clients‟ feedback and suggestion to improve the services and solutions. The survey was successfully completed with a very low non-responsive rate. The outcome illustrated the fact that the clients perceived the services as solution to be good and feel that the products are reliable, accessible and in line with the quality that LC promises. On the contrary, Clients also felt that the staffs are not prompt, polite and responsive and do not communicate with them on a regular basis. Another negative factor mentioned by the clients was the long waiting time which was referred to as expensive and the reason behind this was found from the subjective analysis. The thorough and elaborate process that helps the bank manage the risks, lengthens the waiting time. Despite all these shortcomings, the comprehensive research portrayed that the efficient process and the evaluation of analysis at different levels by different experts ensures thorough inquiry and flawless decision making.

40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Masters of Business Administration, 2015. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 30). The topic of my internship report is “Credit Risk Management Practices in Mutual Trust Bank Limited”. The justification of my report writing on this topic is that credit risk management has attained the latest highlighted feature in the banking field. The arena of credit risk has gained extensive attention in recent years due to the increased competition and {{the challenges of the}} present financial crisis. The main objective of my report is to have a complete knowledge on the activities performed in Credit Risk Management of Mutual Trust Bank Limited. In this report, I have put some specific objectives and methodology to reach the main objective. Specific objectives are to learn the most recent risk regulation for banks which is linked with credit risk management, to understand various dimensions of risk involved in different credit transactions, to suggest scopes of improvement in credit risk management of Mutual Trust Bank Limited. To get the answers of my objectives, I have considered credit risk grading, risk area analysis under qualitative and quantitative approach for credit risk assessment, <b>credit</b> <b>approval</b> <b>process,</b> administration and recovery process and also gone through several newspapers and MTB Annual Report 2014 for required information. This report contains some limitation because of information security concern and my interest to have coverage in General Banking, Clearing, Foreign Exchange and Credit Department within the 12 -week internship period. Bangladesh Bank has formulated Credit Risk Guideline to supervise the process of Credit Risk Management. As a scheduled local bank in Bangladesh, Mutual Trust Bank Limited (MTB) complies with that policy and it has the entire infrastructure in place and activities are performed accordingly. It has adopted a well-structured Credit Risk Management Policy approved by the Board. MTB is currently following BASEL II as bank regulation to measure and mitigate credit risk. Credit Risk Grading is used to assess the borrower’s risk on the basis of scorecard and score sheet. After completing of this grading, credit proposal is processed and submitted for approval. Then credit is administered and monitored to check whether the purpose of credit is being met or it is misused. So to check the risk regularly and to improve credit risk management practices in Mutual Trust Bank Limited, the role of audit, importance of training system and partnership with financial institution for this training have been suggested. Total emphasis on this particular area is given as it is believed that the credit risk management process of a bank is a good indicator {{of the quality of the}} bank's loan portfolio. Umme WaraM.

When competition intensifies, prospecting for loans becomes more important and banks' internal agency problem worsens.
