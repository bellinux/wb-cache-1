50|$|The {{political}} struggle over escheat was difficult. One central {{point of contention}} regarding reversion of ownership to the state was unconstitutional encroachment on private ownership. The law gave no preferential treatment to Norwegian companies, although some argued that it should. The law placed foreign and Norwegian stakeholders on an equal footing. All parties were required to allow the Norwegian authorities {{to act as an}} intermediary in the public interest that could impose conditions on the acquisition of natural resources. Only the state itself, municipalities, or Norwegian citizens (not corporations) were permitted to buy waterfalls without a concession. Undertakings in which at least two-thirds of the capital was publicly owned were able to obtain a concession in perpetuity. The industrial <b>concession</b> <b>law</b> and watercourse law of 1917 strengthened the authorities' control. In addition to conditions stipulating a maximum limitation of 60 years, reversion to the state, and obligatory surrender of control to municipalities, the provisions also specified direct economic benefits to the municipalities and the state in the form of licensing fees. The concession laws ensured that local power development would come under national control. The laws thus affected the ownership structure in the hydropower sector not only between Norwegian and foreign companies, but also between private and public investors.|$|E

The aim of the 1991 <b>Concession</b> <b>Law,</b> and that of the specific contracts associated with each project, has been to provide much-needed infrastructure efficiently and without committing government resources better employed elsewhere. Using the contracts of four infrastructure projects involving the private sector in Chile, we show that even though these projects and the Concessions Program are positively evaluated, design flaws in the auction setup directly or indirectly reduced competition in the bidding process, negatively affected performance, created incentives for ex-post renegotiation and precluded welfare maximization.

This paper describes and analyzes the effect of the new Spanish <b>Concession</b> <b>Law</b> on risk sharing, in particular, the effect of the so-called progress clause on the calculation of risk held by the con-cessionaire. This law was designed both to reinforce private financing of public facilities and to improve the legal framework by defining a new risk-sharing approach, particularly in relation to the risks involved in esti-mating traffic demand.

5000|$|The <b>concession</b> <b>laws</b> were a {{dominant}} topic in Norwegian politics from {{the dissolution of}} the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905 to the First World War. The issue created government crises and led to political splits. The underlying cause was major technological changes, industrial growth, and hydropower plants that saw their first major expansion. Increasingly more people became aware that waterfalls and rivers, referred to as [...] "white coal" [...] (hvite kull), could be developed to produce electricity. Opportunities for major industry based on hydropower created prospects for quick profits. Rural people were largely unaware of these new innovations. Merchants traveled around the country, buying up water rights on a grand scale. They were often referred to as [...] "hydropower speculators" [...] (fossespekulanter) because most of them purchased simply to resell at a profit. Those buying the water rights were often backed by foreign investors. In 1906, over three-quarters of the waterfalls that had been developed were foreign-owned. Water resources director Gunnar Sætren was also connected with waterfall speculation and was extensively criticized for having given a map of the catchment areas in Norway to Swedish capital interests, as a result of which he left his position in 1907.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to create a {{detailed}} account of what Latin American pension funds have meant to the financing of infrastructures, with the purpose of serving as a basis for reflection regarding potential improvements to optimize the portfolios of pension funds and accomplish a greater contribution of retirement savings to the evelopment of countries. The involvement of pension funds in infrastructure is a recommended strategy for managed portfolios based on the criteria establishing that they should be an attractive investment for future pensions, and thus must reach an adequate balance between return and risk. Likewise, given the importance of infrastructure in development, we see that a more significant involvement of pension funds also constitutes a desirable goal because it implies not only greater private benefits for owners of retirement savings (affiliates), but also for society as a whole. In order to perform a complete analysis, we study the evolution and traditional forms of participation in the financing of infrastructure, identifying strengths as well as weaknesses to be corrected. Existing processes are also described, which have assisted to a greater or lesser extent in the involvement of the private sector through <b>concession</b> <b>laws</b> in these countries. Finally, we discuss the different tools that the current systems depend on which allow the involvement of pension funds, as well as how these processes have been carried out up to this moment and the opportunities foreseen. ...|$|R

The process of concessions and transfer of generation assets to private companies was started in 1994 and relaunched in 2002 as it had not been completed yet. Private companies emerging from the 1992 reforms made substantial investment commitments that were fulfilled in the following years. Investment figures reached their highest levels in the period 1996-1999, declining afterwards once the commitments had been fulfilled. The high level of investment led to annual average increases in installed capacity of 9.2%, a rate that was not matched by the increase in demand, which increased at only 4.7% per year on average. As a result, the level of reserves in the National Interconnected System (SEIN) increased at average rates of 23.2%. Investments in transmission and distribution led to increases in coverage from 53% in 1993 to 76% in 2004.|$|R

5000|$|The {{mining law}} of 15 March 1870 {{declared}} all mineral deposits {{to a certain}} depth underground to be property of the state, and therefore subject to mining <b>concessions.</b> Another <b>law</b> in 1874 regulated the manner of these concessions, which were to become {{a major source of}} revenue for public finances.

The government had also intended to introduce a clause requiring the extracted iron ore to be processed in the country (the Verhüttungsklausel). However, this measure was strongly opposed by Germany, as it was contrary to the principles of the Zollverein, and in the end it was dropped. Nevertheless, through the laws of 1870 and 1874, the government had given itself a powerful instrument to steer the industrialisation of the country.|$|R

40|$|On the 4 th October 2010 the law {{of murder}} in England and Wales changed {{dramatically}} when the partial defence of Provocation was abolished by the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and replaced with a new partial defence of Loss of Control. Until its abolition, the doctrine of Provocation was deeply entrenched within the criminal law. A feature in the legal systems of many other jurisdictions, Provocation was the <b>law’s</b> <b>concession</b> that passion aroused in a person can become so over-powering that they lose their self-control and become a killer. Provocation had thus been said to occupy a unique role in making such a <b>concession</b> in the <b>law</b> of homicide for ‘human frailty’. But in spite of being a well-developed concept to make allowance in {{the law of}} homicide for heightened emotions and human frailty, Provocation was a perennial source of problems for the courts of England and Wales for it {{was born out of}} a violent society in the infancy of the criminal justice system. This thesis explores the origins of Provocation and in particular how the Loss of Control doctrine has developed since its introduction in the 19 th century into a fully-fledged partial defence. The aim of this thesis is to answer the following questions: 1) Why, if the criminal law is meant to do its utmost to dissuade people from killing one another, did we have a partial defence grounded in loss of control which permitted lethal retaliatory anger as a response? 2) What does having a new partial defence of loss of control based on anger and now fear really mean and what impact will it have? 3) Is it appropriate for the new statutory provisions to partially excuse/justify murder on grounds of loss of control?...|$|R

50|$|However, {{the use of}} carts {{exploded}} {{with the}} coming of the railways. Firstly, highly mobile customers required food and drink to keep them warm within the early open carriages. Secondly, locomotives needed to stop regularly to take on coal and water, and hence allow their passengers use the toilets, eat and drink. Thirdly, few early trains had any form of buffet or dining car. Finally, when passengers did arrive at their destination, or at a point when they needed to switch trains or modes of transport, some refreshment was required, particularly for poorer passengers who could not afford to stay in the railway-owned hotels. This expansion lead to a mutually successful relationship with some of the first <b>concession</b> stands and <b>laws</b> developing from mobile traders operating from restricted railway property. This form of concession based operation can be seen still in many countries, but at its most original in the under developed stations and infrastructure of Africa and Southeast Asia.|$|R
