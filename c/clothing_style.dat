5|$|Manhattan {{has been}} the scene of many {{important}} American cultural movements. In 1912, about 20,000 workers, a quarter of them women, marched upon Washington Square Park to commemorate the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, which killed 146 workers on March 25, 1911. Many of the women wore fitted tucked-front blouses like those manufactured by the Triangle Shirtwaist Company, a <b>clothing</b> <b>style</b> that became the working woman's uniform and a symbol of women's liberation, reflecting the alliance of labor and suffrage movements.|$|E
5|$|González-Gordon {{has been}} {{described}} as being proud of his Scottish heritage, which centred on the town of Huntly and the Clan Gordon. His personal <b>clothing</b> <b>style</b> reflected this; he was noted for his tweed jackets and British clothes in general. He had been married to Milagro López de Carrizosa y Eizaguirre for 62 years before she died in July 2013. The couple had two children, Bibiana and Mauricio, with Mauricio being the current president of the family company. During the three final years of his life González-Gordon was in poor health and could hardly leave his home. He died on 27 September 2013 in his hometown of Jerez de la Frontera at the age of 89. His family claims that the last thing he drank was a Tío Pepe, the most famous brand of the family business. His death occurred at the Asisa clinic where he had spent his last couple of weeks. The memorial service was held at the San Juan Bautista de La Salle church on 28 September.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1980s, long hair, leather rocker jackets (biker jackets) or cut-off denim jackets, tight {{worn-out}} jeans, and white, high trainers (sneakers) and badges with logos of favorite metal bands were popular among metalheads, and musicians of heavy metal and speed metal bands. In the second half of the 1980s, this <b>clothing</b> <b>style</b> was popular among musicians and fans of more extreme and niche (often underground) metal bands – thrash metal, crossover thrash, early black metal, and early death metal bands. It was popular particularly in European nations, but it was also popular in the US, Canada, and Brazil.|$|E
25|$|Many North American {{hardcore}} punk fans {{adopted a}} dressed-down style of T-shirts, jeans, combat boots or sneakers and crewcut-style haircuts.

It was essentially deconstruction of American fashion staples—ripped jeans, holey T-shirts, torn stockings for women, and work boots. The style of the 1980s hardcore scene contrasted with the more provocative fashion styles of late 1970s punk rockers (elaborate hairdos, torn clothes, patches, safety pins, studs, spikes, etc.).|$|E

In the 2002 campaign, Lula foreswore both his informal <b>clothing</b> <b>style</b> and his platform plank of linking the payment of Brazil's foreign debt to a prior thorough audit. This last point had worried economists, businessmen and banks, who feared that even a partial Brazilian default along with the existing Argentine default would have a massive ripple effect through the world economy.

25|$|According {{to persons}} interviewed at the Pansio {{reception}} centre by national broadcaster Yle, the main suspect arrived to the centre in December 2016 and displayed radicalist behaviour during his stay, such as asking {{how he could}} join the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), listening to radicalist sermons on his phone and considering Finns to be infidels. The interviewees warned the reception centre management of this behaviour in January 2017. Helsinki Times published similar interviews afterwards.

25|$|By tradition, a lady of {{the court}} was instantaneously {{recognizable}} by her panniers, corset and weighty silk materials that constructed her gown {{in the style of}} à la française or à l’anglaise. By doing away with these things, Marie Antoinette’s gaulle or chemise á la Reine stripped female aristocrats of their traditional identity; noblewomen could now be confused with peasant girls, confusing long standing sartorial differences in class. The chemise was made from a white muslin and the queen was further accused of importing foreign fabrics and crippling the French silk industry. The gaulle consisted of thin layers of this muslin, loosely draped around the body and belted at the waist, and was often worn with an apron and a fichu. This trend was quickly adopted by fashionable women in France and England, but upon the debut of the portrait of Marie Antoinette by Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun, the <b>clothing</b> <b>style</b> created a scandal and increased the hatred for the queen. The queen’s clothing in the portrait looked like a chemise, nothing more than a garment that women wore under her other clothing or to lounge in the intimate space of the private boudoir. It was perceived to be indecent, and especially unbecoming for the queen. The sexual nature of the gaulle undermined the notions of status and the ideology that gave her and kept her in power. Marie Antoinette wanted to be private and individual, a notion unbecoming for a member of the monarchy that is supposed to act {{as a symbol of the}} state.|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} of the {{research}} has been {{to find out why}} Moroccan urban dress is one of the rare ‘traditional’ <b>clothing</b> <b>styles</b> that developed into a fashion industry whereas the majority of local <b>clothing</b> <b>styles</b> has either disappeared or stopped to evolve. Five phenomena in Moroccan society are believed to have {{played a crucial role in}} this process. First of all, Moroccan dress is considered as part of an ‘ancient’ cultural heritage by its wearers. Secondly, three generations of Moroccan fashion designers succeeded in adapting Moroccan <b>clothing</b> <b>styles</b> to new circumstances in Moroccan society at crucial moments in time. Third, the local media played an important role in the democratization of Moroccan fashion while fourthly its commercialization was influenced by the introduction of western confection brands at the turn of the 21 st century. Finally, there is the important cultural, social, political, economic and religious role that Moroccan <b>clothing</b> <b>styles</b> continue to play in contemporary Moroccan society. An important contribution of the research to the theoretical discussion on globalization is that the introduction of western confection brands does not automatically leads to the disappearing of local <b>clothing</b> <b>styles,</b> but on the contrary can contribute to its development by introducing new patterns of consumption...|$|R

500|$|In IC in a Sunflower {{and all her}} works, Mihara uses {{character}} designs incorporating Lolita fashion—a <b>clothing</b> <b>style</b> {{influenced by}} the Rococo style and the Victorian and Edwardian eras.

[...] Mihara {{has been involved with}} the shaping of the Gothic Lolita style—a subset of the Lolita fashion which incorporates dark colors—through her artwork; she illustrated the first eight covers of the fashion magazine-book Gothic & Lolita Bible and later returned to illustrating the covers with the twenty-seventh volume in fall 2007.|$|E

[...] Nolan speaks with an English accent, which supports a more sophisticated impression accentuated by his habit of wearing suits. Professionally, he commonly dresses in a clubbable but also muted ensemble, often wearing a dark and narrow-lapeled jacket over a blue dress shirt. In colder weather, he is observed as carrying a herringbone waistcoat (with the bottom button left open).

500|$|The {{character}} Vanilla, {{the concept}} of the Dolls, and SG Corporation first appeared in manga artist Mitsukazu Mihara's earlier short manga [...] (1995), later collected in IC in a Sunflower (1997). Doll began as [...] "the simple notion of humans vs. robots". Although she often uses Lolita fashion—a <b>clothing</b> <b>style</b> influenced by the Rococo style and the Victorian and Edwardian eras—in her character designs as a way to convey the duality of her characters, she felt that the fashion failed to give the manga depth. She then centered the plots on the psychological aspects. As Mihara has expressed an interest in exploring the impact of the childhood environment on a person, especially his or her relationships with parents, the stories in Doll involve the eponymous androids and family life. Each short story contains an independent theme; [...] "A Maid Servant", for example, takes its inspiration from a book about aging fears, and [...] "miseducation" [...] serves as the theme for a story about cram school, inspired by a book about the inadequacy of solely teaching theories.|$|E
500|$|In the 2002 film Austin Powers in Goldmember, Beyoncé portrays Foxxy Cleopatra, {{the female}} protagonist {{alongside}} the film's lead character, Austin Powers, portrayed by Canadian film actor and comedian Mike Myers.

Cleopatra and police officer Get Christie Love! use the slang term [...] "sugar", which Beyoncé ad-libs and incorporates into the song. Many similarities are seen as she performs under her Cleopatra persona in the music video of [...] "Work It Out". Due to the characters' sassy nature, Beyoncé performs the song very confidently and assertively.

With Charlene's help, she began to dress differently and as she became more confident, she began drawing the attention of male characters, most notably Mike Young (Guy Pierce) and eventually was seen as a [...] "heart-breaker". Jane's grandmother Nell Mangel (Vivean Gray) does not approve of her change in personality, but Jane ignores her worries and becomes a model. Following her make over, she becomes more assertive and takes the initiative to end her relationship with Mike Young. She then begins an affair with an older man.|$|E

He felt that the key to understanding Todd was his concern about his status and how others perceived him. He thought that Todd mistreated people because it made him feel better about himself and that he did not want to appear vulnerable, so his defense mechanisms [...] "spun out of control". Howarth, during an April 1994 Soap Opera Update interview, said that the only thing that he admired about Todd was his <b>clothing</b> <b>style.</b> His interviewer called Todd's early fashion sense [...] "grunge, Salvation Army like 'rags'," [...] and Howarth described Todd's later wardrobe as [...] "all Ralph Lauren" [...] and [...] "ouble R.L. 80 dollar pants and a 400-and-something-dollar jacket".

500|$|Unlike Tandy, Nappi did {{not read}} the books before {{illustrating}} them; instead, his wife read them and provided him with a brief plot summary before Nappi began painting. Nappi's first cover was for The Clue of the Velvet Mask, where he began a trend of portraying Nancy as [...] "bobby-soxer... a contemporary sixteen-year-old. This Nancy was perky, clean-cut, and extremely animated. In {{the majority of his}} covers Nancy looks startled– which, no doubt, she was." [...] Nancy's style is considerably conservative, and remains so during the psychedelic period. Although she wears bold colors and prints, or the background colors are shades of electric yellow, shocking pink, turquoise, or apple green, her clothing is high-necked and with long hemlines. Earlier Nappi covers show Nancy in poses similar to those in the covers by Tandy and Gillies; for many updated covers he simply updated the color scheme, <b>clothing</b> <b>style,</b> and hairstyles of the characters but retains their original poses in similar settings. Later Nappi covers show only Nancy's head or part of her body, surrounded by spooky or startling elements or clues from the story.
