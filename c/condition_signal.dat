One of the important area of research in the tool wear monitoring system is the application of artificial intelligent techniques for sensor fusion strategy and rational decision making for tool and process conditions. Considerable work has been attempted by many previous authors to develop this technique. However many of these monitoring systems did not adequately give the desired information regarding to the cutting process condition, due to insufficient sensor information and the complex nature of the cutting process itself In this research, a multisensor or sensor fusion approach has been used to integrate the acoustic emission (AE) and forces signals from the cutting process, in order to estimate the tool and cutting <b>condition.</b> <b>Signal</b> processing techniques including spectrum density analysis (FFT) and time series were employed to extract additional information from the signals.

The goal of the present research was to further characterize this deficit in dyslexic adults. In order to specify the mechanisms and processing strategies used by adults with dyslexia during speech-in-noise perception, we explored the influence of background type, presenting single target-words against backgrounds made of cocktail party sounds, modulated speech-derived noise or stationary noise. We also evaluated the effect of three listening configurations differing {{in terms of the}} amount of spatial processing required. In a monaural <b>condition,</b> <b>signal</b> and noise were presented to the same ear while in a dichotic situation, target and concurrent sound were presented to two different ears, finally in a spatialised configuration, target and competing signals were presented as if they originated from slightly differing positions in the auditory scene. Our results confirm the presence of a speech-in-noise perception deficit in dyslexic adults, in particular when the competing signal is also speech, and when both signals are presented to the same ear, an observation potentially relating to phonological accounts of dyslexia. However, adult dyslexics demonstrated better levels of spatial release of masking than normal reading controls when the background was speech, suggesting that they are well able to rely on denoising strategies based on spatial auditory scene analysis strategies...|$|E

40|$|Honest sexual {{signalling}} {{requires that}} the level of advertisement reveals mate quality. In the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, females base their mate choice mainly on the intensity of the males’ red breeding coloration. Different results have, however, been obtained on the relationship between red breeding coloration and physical condition. In this study, the relationship was curvilinear in a natural population, with males in good and poor condition (measured as lipid content) having larger red areas than males of intermediate condition. By manipulating food intake and thus male condition prior to breeding, I further show that poor condition can induce an increase in signalling effort. This effect was further strengthened when the predation cost of signalling was increased by exposing the males to predators. This suggests that the reason for the high signalling effort of males in poor condition is their low probability of future reproduction and thus lower cost of signalling in terms of loss of future reproductive opportunities. Males in poor <b>condition</b> <b>signal</b> as a terminal effort and take larger risks and invest more in current reproduction than males in good condition. Finally, I discuss whether an effect of decreasing residual reproductive value on signalling effort could result in the breakdown of the honesty of the signal...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{deals with}} the {{methodology}} of using haptics and biorobotics principles, together with creating a new intelligent system, to improve the safety in automotive. Many projects in European Union programs are devoted to the increase of safety in automotive, {{in order to reduce}} deaths and accidents down to 50 % in the next few years. The project here presented PSYCAR aims at a new driving system, with small modifications, where the wheel and the buttons are inserted in an architecture of intelligent sensors, able to monitor the psychophysical state of the driver, in order to avoid accidents due to sleep attacks and assumption of alcohol or drugs. All the indications will come from the wheel, where the hands and the finger actuate a great part of the control of the car. Main goal of research is to define the right parameters for driver’s psycho-physical status monitoring inside the “Car System”. The results on driver conditions will be connected with the mechanical parameters of the car, the environmental conditions. By use of key cards defining the driver personal <b>condition,</b> <b>signal</b> data will be inserted in a new architecture, where neural networks and fuzzy logic represent the tool to apply multivariate statistics. The sensors network has a reference centre the steering wheel, where the driver applies his hands and fingers: their actions are the “haptic intelligence ” of the driver, which feels the motion and the safety parameters {{with the support of the}} sensors embedded in the wheel and in the car itself...|$|E
