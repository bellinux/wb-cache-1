Patient satisfaction regarding quality of care and the way of communication improved significantly in the intervention group. To support patients in a more structured way of communicating the PAC-Card is recommended to be used by patients.

40|$|We {{conducted}} a three-phase study {{to evaluate the}} use of mands and the occurrence of problem behavior for 2 children with developmental disabilities. During Phase 1, a functional analysis identified the variables maintaining problem behavior. During Phase 2, functional communication training was implemented within a concurrent schedules design. The children were reinforced for using either a novel mand (<b>communication</b> <b>card)</b> or other existing mands (vocal speech, manual signs) that were not specifically trained but were observed {{to be part of the}} children’s existing repertoire. We then {{conducted a}}n assessment of mands and problem behavior across different stimulus conditions (card absent, card present) within an ABAB design (Phase 3). Results showed that during Phase 2, problem behavior decreased and participants used the card more frequently than they used other existing mands. Phase 3 showed that problem behavior remained low across both stimulus conditions. When the card was absent, the children used other existing mands; when the card was present, they primarily used the card. These results suggested that the presence of a <b>communication</b> <b>card</b> may function as a discriminative stimulus for a specific topography of manding, but that training with the card did not inhibit the use of other mands when the card was absent...|$|E

40|$|Eight young {{children}} who displayed destructive behavior maintained, at least in part, by negative reinforcement received long-term functional communication training (FCT). During FCT, the children completed {{a portion of a}} task and then touched a <b>communication</b> <b>card</b> attached to a microswitch to obtain brief breaks. Prior to and intermittently throughout FCT, extinction probes were conducted within a withdrawal design in which task completion, manding, and destructive behavior were placed on extinction to evaluate the relative persistence of appropriate and destructive behavior over the course of treatment. FCT continued until appropriate behavior persisted and destructive behavior failed to recur at baseline levels during extinction probes. The completion of FCT was followed by four challenges to the persistence of treatment effects conducted within mixed- or multiple-schedule designs: (a) extended extinction sessions (from 5 to 15  min), (b) introduction of a novel task, (c) removal of the microswitch and <b>communication</b> <b>card,</b> and (d) a mixed schedule of reinforcement in which both appropriate and destructive behavior produced reinforcement. The results showed that although FCT often resulted in quick reductions in destructive behavior and increases in appropriate behavior, destructive behavior often recurred during the extinction probes conducted during the initial treatment. When the effects of treatment persisted during the extinction probes, the remaining challenges to treatment effects resulted in only mild to moderate disruptions in behavior. These results are consistent with the quantitative predictions of behavioral momentum theory and may provide an alternative definition of maintenance as constituting behavioral persistence...|$|E

40|$|Greeting <b>card</b> <b>communication</b> {{reflects}} the highly gendered division of both emotional and domestic labor in American culture. It’s generally thought that American {{men do not}} take as much responsibility for sending greeting cards as women, or display competence in this mode of communication, and both survey data and field work with greeting card consumers confirm this overall pattern. For many women, greeting <b>card</b> <b>communication</b> {{is part of a}} feminized habitus that includes kinship work as well as routine provisioning for the household. For men, taking an interest in greeting cards can seem like discrediting behavior for heterosexual masculinity, and so the belief that “men are bad at cards” circulates as one way of asserting gender difference. The greeting card industry reinforces this gendered view of greeting <b>card</b> <b>communication,</b> incorporating beliefs about gendered communication styles into its marketing, advertising, and card sentiments, and framing cards as a solution to the resulting communication gap. The feminization of greeting <b>card</b> <b>communication</b> illustrates the compulsion to view the world in gendered terms, and its contrast with the telephone, in which the telephone comes to seem the more “masculine” alternative, illustrates elasticity in attributions of gender appropriateness...|$|R
