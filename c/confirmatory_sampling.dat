40|$|Abstract Background Posttraumatic {{growth is}} the {{positive}} change resulting from traumatic experiences and is typically assessed with retrospective measures like the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI). The PTGI {{was designed to}} include reference to a specific traumatic event, {{making it difficult to}} implement, without change, in prospective survey studies. Thus, a modified Posttraumatic Growth Inventory–Short Form (PTGI-SF) was included in a large prospective study of current and former U. S. military personnel. The current study provides preliminary psychometric data for this modified measure and its ability to assess psychological well-being at a single time point. Methods The study population (N[*]=[*] 135, 843) was randomly and equally split into exploratory and <b>confirmatory</b> <b>samples</b> that were proportionately balanced on trauma criterion. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were performed to assess the psychometric validity of the modified measure. The final model was also assessed in a subset of the <b>confirmatory</b> <b>sample</b> with a history of trauma using CFA. Results Results supported a single-factor model with two additional correlations between items assessing spirituality and items assessing compassion/appreciation for others. This model also fits among the subset with a history of trauma. The resulting measure was strongly associated with social support and personal mastery. Conclusions The modified PTGI-SF in this study captures psychological well-being in cross-sectional assessments, in addition to being able to measure posttraumatic growth with multiple assessments. Results indicate that the modified measure is represented by a single factor, but that items assessing spirituality and compassion/appreciation for others may be used alone to better capture these constructs...|$|R

40|$|This study {{proposed}} and tested a process-oriented model {{for understanding the}} decision of members of community-based prevention coalitions to continue actively participating. Investigations of Citizen Participation seldom test models, taking an exploratory approach to the correlates and causes of Participation. Operationalizing variables representing two important domains, the Costs/Benefits of past participation and the Cognitive Social Learning Variables (CSLVs), two submodels were evaluated within an exploratory-confirmatory structural equation model testing design. Social exchange theory informs the Costs/Benefits submodel, whereas the CSLV Submodel includes relationships suggested by Expectancy-Value and Planned Behavior Theories. Then, an integrated model in which the CSLV submodel mediates some {{of the influence of}} experienced incentives to explain intentions for future participation was refined and tested. ^ Mailed survey responses from 273 members of 35 municipal prevention task forces were randomly assigned to either calibration (N = 136) or confirmatory (N = 137) samples. After the measurement model and initial structural model were refined with the calibration sample (Appendix on scale refinement is included), confirmatory tests indicated good overall fit, confirming the majority of the hypothesized relationships: The CSLV submodel explained 45 % of the variance in intent to continue participating, whereas the Costs/benefits explained 23 % of the variance for the <b>confirmatory</b> <b>sample.</b> As hypothesized, the larger, better fitting Expectancy-value based model explained more unique variance in the <b>confirmatory</b> <b>sample</b> (28 %) than the smaller, less well-fitting Social Exchange model (6 %). The integrated model predicted the most variance (51 %). ^ Perceived Participation Skills and Group Outcome Expectations were found to be the largest direct predictors of intent to participate. Moreover, Participation skills mediated the impact of Costs associated with organizational participation, while Expectations mediated the impact of Organizational Costs and all Benefits on intentions. Time opportunity costs directly and negatively related to intent. Mixed support for the role of Perceptions of Problem Severity and Community Value was found. These results support the use of Cognitive Social Learning Variables and extend their role theoretically and empirically integrating variables across time and variable domains. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Subjective memory {{complaints}} (SMC) {{are common}} but their significance is still unclear. It {{has been suggested}} they are a precursor of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia and an early indicator of cognitive decline. Vascular risk factors {{have an important role}} in the development of dementia and possibly MCI. We therefore aimed to test the hypothesis that vascular risk factors were associated with SMC, independent of psychological distress, in a middle-aged community-dwelling population. Methods A cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the 45 and Up Study was performed. This is a cohort study of people living in New South Wales (Australia), and we explored the sample of 45, 532 participants aged between 45 and 64 years. SMC were defined as 'fair' or 'poor' on a self-reported five-point Likert scale of memory function. Vascular risk factors of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and smoking were identified by self-report. Psychological distress was measured by the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. We tested the model generated from a randomly selected exploratory sample (n = 22, 766) with a <b>confirmatory</b> <b>sample</b> of equal size. Results 5, 479 / 45, 532 (12 %) of respondents reported SMC. Using multivariate logistic regression, only two vascular risk factors: smoking (OR 1. 18; 95 % CI = 1. 03 - 1. 35) and hypercholesterolaemia (OR 1. 19; 95 % CI = 1. 04 - 1. 36) showed a small independent association with SMC. In contrast psychological distress was strongly associated with SMC. Those with the highest levels of psychological distress were 7. 00 (95 % CI = 5. 41 - 9. 07) times more likely to have SMC than the non-distressed. The <b>confirmatory</b> <b>sample</b> also demonstrated the strong association of SMC with psychological distress rather than vascular risk factors. Conclusions In a large sample of middle-aged people without any history of major affective illness or stroke, psychological distress was strongly, and vascular risk factors only weakly, associated with SMC, although we cannot discount psychological distress acting as a mediator in any association between vascular risk factors and SMC. Given this, clinicians should be vigilant regarding the presence of an affective illness when assessing middle-aged patients presenting with memory problems. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the introduction of two-sample policy for transfusion at our hospital and reduction of the risk of ABO incompatible transfusion. BACKGROUND: ABO incompatible transfusion can be a fatal but avoidable event. Wrong blood in tube is a cause of ABO incompatible transfusion and there are various strategies available to try and expunge this event. METHODS: Survey of policy/practice before and after the introduction of a two-sample policy. RESULTS: Staff training is inadequate in reducing the risk of ABO incompatible transfusion. A two-sample policy was introduced and does not significantly increase workload or use of group O blood and does not compromise patient safety by causing delay in blood provision. Post hoc analysis confirms good understanding of the policy by medical staff.

For this study, data were obtained from a computerized adaptive test of arithmetic reasoning skills administered {{as part of a larger}} test battery (the Law School Admission Test) to 38, 357 examinees. Four functions (the normal, lognormal, gamma, and Weibull) were fit to empirical distribution functions from a computer-administered test, and the various functions were evaluated to determine which described the empirical distributions the best and provided the most useful parameters for storing in an item bank. The lognormal distribution was found to best fit both exploratory and <b>confirmatory</b> <b>samples.</b> It provides meaningful and useful parameters that can be stored in an item bank. (Contains 3 tables, 8 figures, and 11 references.) (Author/SLD) Reproductions supplied by EDRS are the best that can be made from the original document...|$|R
