This dissertation research was designed to evaluate the impacts of plant establishment, biodegradation, and plant-microbe interactions on cyanide-contaminated soil. Two <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>plants</b> (Sorghum bicolor and Linum usitatissimum) and one non-cyanogenic plant (Panicum virgatum) were selected for remediation of iron-cyanide (Prussian blue) contaminated soil. The biodegradation of hydrogen cyanide by rhizosphere microorganisms also was assessed. ^ The cyanide degradation ability of <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>plants</b> was anticipated to be significantly higher than non-cyanogenic plants. As shown in results from a greenhouse study, there was an 85 % reduction of total cyanide in soil over the 200 -day experimental period by two <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>plants.</b> By evaluating the degradation pathway of 14 C-Prussian blue in a growth chamber study, it was verified that approximately 50 % of the target contaminant was released through the leaves as the radio-labeled carbon dioxide, through the leaves.

40|$|Hydrogen cyanide release during {{feeding of}} generalist and {{specialist}} lepidopteran larvae on a <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>plant,</b> Passiflora capsularis. (Alonso Amelot, Miguel; Avila Nuñez, Jorge Luis; Duarte, Lisday y Oliveros Bastidas, Alberto) Abstract The hydrogen cyanide-based interaction of a strongly <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>plant,</b> Passiflora capsularis, and larvae of two insect herbivores, a generalist (Spodoptera frugiperda) and a specialist (Heliconius erato), is examined {{in terms of}} the combined kinetics of the feeding process and the simultaneous hydrogen cyanide (HCN) liberation, as compared with the natural kinetics of hydrogen cyanide evolution by plant-leaf tissue. There are marked differences in acceptance of P. capsularis by third-instar larvae of specialist and generalist species. The former, H. erato, display a parsimonious ingestion rate of 0. 74 ± 0. 15 mg (fresh weight) min- 1 comprising 18 % active feeding time, whereas S. frugiperda larvae show a more erratic and restrained feeding involving 4 % of the time at 0. 45 ± 0. 14 mg min- 1. These S. frugiperda larvae ingest 124. 4 ± 8. 3 mg (fw) of the non-cyanogeneic Spinacia oleracea leaves in 24 h compared with only 74. 7 ± 20. 1 mg of P. capsularis in the same period. The total hydrogen cyanide released naturally from wild specimens of P. capsularis plants is in the range 326 - 3901 µ g g- 1. Hydrogen cyanide evo lution from macerated P. capsularis leaves takes place along a hyperbolic function with time and initial velocities of cyanide evolution are a linear function of total hydrogen cyanide. When feeding on P. capsularis leaves, H. erato releases only a minor fraction relative to total hydrogen cyanide (0. 09 %) and to the anticipated cyanide from the initial velocity (7 %). By contrast, S. frugiperda evokes 5. 8 -fold more than the anticipated hydrogen cyanide release from the plant. The findings are interpreted as diverging strategies by generalist and specialist insects in the utilization of hydrogen cyanide in cyanogenic plants. alonso@ula. vejlavila@ula. vealoliver@ula. veNivel monográfic...|$|E
30|$|Biochemically, sorghum is a <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>plant</b> {{which is}} able to metabolize oxime {{containing}} precursors (Bak et al. 2000). INAP is an oxime molecule similar to intermediates/precursors during the biosynthesis of glucosinolates and cyanogenic glycosides, two classes of molecules that play vital roles during plant: pathogen/herbivore interactions (Neilson et al. 2013). Plants capable of metabolizing oxime precursors that are subsequently used for defense responses include sorghum and Arabidopsis (Bak et al. 2000), but not tobacco. The enzymes which code for the synthesis of cyanogenic glycosides and glucosinolates exist in tightly associated complexes or metabolons (Møller 2010). The finding of dhurrin as a signatory bio-marker in sorghum cells responding to INAP indicates that the metabolon for oxime metabolism is functional under these conditions. The coordinated response {{as seen in the}} MVDA of the sorghum cell extracts is thus a reflection of the system’s ability to recognize and metabolize oxime intermediates.|$|E

40|$|Cyanogenesis is a {{widespread}} chemical defence mechanism in plants against herbivory. However, some specialised herbivores overcome this protection by different behavioural or metabolic mechanisms. In the present study, we investigated the effect of {{presence or absence of}} cyanogenic glycosides in birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus, Fabaceae) on oviposition behaviour, larval preference, larval development, adult weight and nectar preference of the common blue butterfly (Polyommatus icarus, Lycaenidae). For oviposition behaviour there was a female-specific reaction to cyanogenic glycoside content; i. e. some females preferred to oviposit on <b>cyanogenic</b> over acyanogenic <b>plants,</b> while other females behaved in the opposite way. Freshly hatched larvae did not discriminate between the two plant morphs. Since the two plant morphs differed not only in their content of cyanogenic glycoside, but also in N and water content, we expected these differences to affect larval growth. Contrary to our expectations, larvae feeding on <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>plants</b> showed a faster development and stronger weight gain than larvae feeding on acyanogenic plants. Furthermore, female genotype affected development time, larval and pupal weight of the common blue butterfly. However, most effects detected in the larval phase disappeared for adult weight, indicating compensatory feeding of larvae. Adult butterflies reared on the two <b>cyanogenic</b> glycoside <b>plant</b> morphs did not differ in their nectar preference. But a gender-specific effect was found, where females preferred amino acid-rich nectar while males did not discriminate between the two nectar mimics.

40|$|White clover is {{polymorphic}} for cyanogenesis, {{with both}} cyanogenic and acyanogenic plants occurring in nature. This chemical defense polymorphism {{is one of}} the longest-studied and best-documented examples of an adaptive polymorphism in plants. It is controlled by two independently segregating genes: Ac/ac controls the presence/absence of cyanogenic glucosides; and Li/li controls the presence/absence of their hydrolyzing enzyme, linamarase. Whereas Li is well characterized at the molecular level, Ac has remained unidentified. Here we report evidence that Ac corresponds to a gene encoding a cytochrome P 450 of the CYP 79 D protein subfamily (CYP 79 D 15), and we describe the apparent molecular basis of the Ac/ac polymorphism. CYP 79 D orthologs catalyze the first step in cyanogenic glucoside biosynthesis in other <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>plant</b> species. In white clover, Southern hybridizations indicate that CYP 79 D 15 occurs as a single-copy gene in cyanogenic plants but is absent from the genomes of ac plants.

This apparent molecular basis of the Ac/ac polymorphism parallels our previous findings for the Li/li polymorphism, which also arises through the presence/absence of a single-copy gene.

Significant activity (70 % of p-nitrophenyl-b-D-glucoside activity) was also detected on arbutin and prunasin. Less activity was obtained with cellobiose, amygdalin, or gentiobiose.

40|$|Plants {{producing}} {{toxic plant}} secondary metabolites (PSMs) deter folivores from feeding on them. Animals that can cope with noxious PSMs have a niche with {{a competitive advantage}} over other species. However, the {{ability to cope with}} toxic PSMs incurs the costs of detoxification. To assess possible compensations for the ingestion of toxic PSMs, we compare the chemical quality of plants consumed by bamboo lemurs (genera Hapalemur and Prolemur; strepsirrhine primates of Madagascar) in areas with and without bamboo. Some bamboo lemurs consume bamboo containing concentrations of cyanogenic substances 10 – 50 times above the average lethal dosage for mammals, and we postulate that animals consuming cyanogenic substances need supplementary protein or readily available energy for detoxification. We compared the chemical composition of food consumed by three species of bamboo lemurs that feed mainly (> 80 % of their time) on bamboo in the evergreen rainforest of Ranomafana (Madagascar) with published data of the diets of bamboo lemurs at two sites without highly <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>plants</b> (reed beds of Lac Alaotra and the evergreen littoral forest of Mandena) and with food of sympatric folivorous lemur species that do not feed on bamboo. Lemurs feeding on bamboo consumed up to twice as much protein as bamboo lemurs in areas without bamboo and sympatric lemur species that feed on leaves of trees. Concentrations of nonstructural carbohydrates (a source of energy) showed the opposite trend. This result supports the hypothesis that feeding on <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>plants</b> is linked to high protein intake, either as a source of protein or for sulfur-containing amino acids {{that can be used for}} detoxification.

Distillation was carried out followed by spectrophotometric analysis with pyridine-barbituric acid as the colour forming reagent and absorbance was measured at 578 nm using UV-Visible spectrophotometer. The result revealed total cyanide in each sample as follows (mg/l) : 0. 641 + 0. 004, 0. 443 + 0. 007, 0. 319 + 0. 007, 0. 184 + 0. 001 and 0. 403 + 0. 004, for untreated wastewater sample, treated waste water sample from the factory, Lake water sample beside the factory where the effluent is released, upstream and downstream of a river located about 1 km away from the factory, respectively.

We also studied consumption pattern of common goitrogenic plants by measuring urinary thiocyanate (USCN), hardness of water (calcium and magnesium salt content) and assessed the effect of concomitant exposure of those environmental factors in goitrogenesis. Methods: 4603 children aged 6 - 12 years were examined for goiter by palpation, 520 urine samples were analyzed for UI and USCN; iodine content was estimated in 455 household salt and 130 water samples tested both for iodine and hardness. Results: The total goiter rate was 35. 9 %, median UI was 231 ΅g/l, mean USCN was 0. 857 ± 0. 48 mg/dl, iodine content in water was 44. 7 ± 4. 1 ΅g/l, 66. 4 % of salt samples contained iodine (15 ppm), and water {{was found to be}} hard.

Matrix effects as well as extraction efficiencies {{were found to be}} similar to most other previously investigated matrices with the exception of distinct matrix effects in the negative ionisation mode for early eluting compounds. Limits of detection were far below the regulatory limits set in the European Union for other types of commodities. Relative standard deviations were generally lower than 10 % as determined by replicates spiked on two concentration levels. The sample-to-sample variation of the apparent recoveries was determined for 15 individually spiked samples during three different analytical sequences. The related standard deviation was found to be lower than 15 % for most of the investigated compounds, thus confirming the applicability of the method for quantitative analysis. The occurrence of regulated mycotoxins was lower than 10 % (with the exception of zearalenone) and the related limits were exceeded only in few samples, which suggests that cassava is a comparatively safe commodity as regards mycotoxins. The most prevalent fungal metabolites were emodin, kojic acid, beauvericin, tryptophol, 3 -nitropropionic acid, equisetin, alternariol methylether, monocerin, brevianamide F, tenuazonic acid, zearalenone, chrysophanol, monilifomin, enniatins, apicidin and macrosporin.

Efficiencies of the extraction methods were evaluated by using a modified HPLC method. In general, boiling ethanol was more efficient for amygdalin extraction from foods. Amygdalin contents of a wide range of commercially-available food products were determined for the first time. In the second part, the effect of processing on amygdalin levels in apple juice was investigated. Apple juices produced from different apple varieties were subjected to various processing conditions such as freezing, pasteurization and holding for various times. The results obtained showed that processing can result in reduction of amygdalin level in apple juice and that the reduction of amygdalin by enzymatic degradation probably depends on the level of the enzyme in the processed foods and the utilisation of optimum conditions for the enzyme activities. High-temperature treated commercially-available apple juice had lower amygdalin levels compared to low-temperature treated juices, indicating the degradation of amygdalin at high processing temperatures. In the last part, the development of a sensitive ELISA method for amygdalin was investigated. Antibody produced by using an immunogen that was synthesized using the cyanuric chloride method for coupling of hapten to carrier protein was highly immunoreactive and very specific for amygdalin. The ELISA developed using this antibody was very sensitive (LOD = 0. 2 ng/ml). The results obtained from the determination of amygdalin in foods using the ELISA method showed excellent correlation with those obtained from HPLC method. The work described is the first comprehensive study on detection of a particular cyanogenic glycoside and use of an antibody-based method for determination of amygdalin in processed foods.

The Burnet moth Zygaena filipendulae (Lepidoptera) and its food-plant Lotus corniculatus (Fabaceae) poses an exemplary case study of these questions, as Z. filipendulae belongs to the only insect family known to both de novo biosynthesize and sequester the same defense compounds directly from its food-plant. Z. filipendulae and L. corniculatus both contain the two cyanogenic glucosides linamarin and lotaustralin, which are defense compounds that can be hydrolyzed to liberate toxic hydrogen cyanide. The overall amounts and ratios of linamarin and lotaustralin in Z. filipendulae are tightly regulated, and only to a low extent reflect the ratio in the ingested food-plant. We demonstrate that Z. filipendulae adjusts the de novo biosynthesis of CNglcs by regulation at both the transcriptional and protein level depending on food plant composition. Ultimately this ensures that the larva saves energy and nitrogen while maintaining an effective defense system to fend off predators. By using in situ PCR and immunolocalization, the biosynthetic pathway was resolved to the larval fat body and integument, which infers rapid replenishment of defense compounds following an encounter with a predator. Our study supports the hypothesis that de novo biosynthesis of CNglcs in Z. filipendulae preceded the ability to sequester, and facilitated a food-plant switch to <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>plants,</b> after which sequestration could evolve.

CYP 79 A 1 and CYP 71 E 1 catalyze {{the conversion of the}} parent amino acid tyrosine to p-hydroxymandelonitrile, the aglycone of the cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin. CYP 79 A 1 catalyzes the conversion of tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime and CYP 71 E 1, the subsequent conversion to p-hydroxymandelonitrile. p-Hydroxymandelonitrile is labile and dissociates into p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide, the same products released from dhurrin upon cell disruption as a result of pest or herbivore attack. In transgenic plants expressing CYP 79 A 1 as well as CYP 71 E 1, the activity of CYP 79 A 1 is higher than that of CYP 71 E 1, resulting in the accumulation of several p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime-derived products in the addition to those derived from p-hydroxymandelonitrile. Transgenic tobacco and Arabidopsis plants expressing only CYP 79 A 1 accumulate the same p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime-derived products as transgenic plants expressing both sorghum cytochrome P 450 enzymes. In addition, the transgenic CYP 79 A 1 Arabidopsis plants accumulate large amounts of p-hydroxybenzylglucosinolate. In transgenic Arabidopsis expressing CYP 71 E 1, this enzyme and the enzymes of the pre-existing glucosinolate pathway compete for the p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime as substrate, resulting in the formation of small amounts of p-hydroxybenzylglucosinolate.

Analysing and determining the levels of toxicity in plants is often constrained {{by a lack of}} required chemicals, equipment, money or expertise. Together with colleagues, Howard Bradbury from the Australian National University has developed a range of practical kits that can be used by an unskilled person for looking at cyanide levels in cassava roots and products, as well as other <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>plant</b> parts such as sorghum leaves, bamboo shoots and flax seed meal. The general principle is that a small sample of the plant or product is placed in a container with filter paper containing the required catalyst and a piece of picrate paper that reveals the amount of poison produced. The bottle is left overnight at room temperature. Next morning, when the breakdown to poisonous gas is completed, the colour of the picrate paper indicates the level of toxicity. The researchers have also developed a similar kit for determining the amount of cyanide ingested after consuming cassava or other cyanogenic plants.

40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comA multigenic trait (biosynthesis of the secondary metabolite, dhurrin cyanogenic glucoside) was engineered de novo in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.). This follows a recent report of transfer of the same trait to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) using three genetic sequences from sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) : two cytochrome P 450 -encoding cDNAs (CYP 79 A 1 and CYP 71 E 1) and a UDPG-glucosyltransferase-encoding cDNA (sbHMNGT). Here we describe the two-step process involving whole plant transformation followed by hairy root transformation, which was used to transfer the same three sorghum sequences to grapevine. Transgenic grapevine hairy root lines that accumulated transcript from none, one (sbHMNGT), two (CYP 79 A 1 and CYP 71 E 1) or all three transgenes were recovered and characterisation of these lines provided information about the requirements for dhurrin biosynthesis in grapevine. Only lines that accumulated transcripts from all three transgenes had significantly elevated cyanide potential (up to the equivalent of about 100 mg HCN kg− 1 fresh weight), and levels were highly variable. One dhurrin-positive line was tested and found to release cyanide upon maceration and can therefore be considered ‘cyanogenic’. In in vitro dual co-culture of this cyanogenic hairy root line or an acyanogenic line with the specialist root-sucking, gall-forming, aphid-like insect, grapevine phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae, Fitch), there was no evidence for protection of the <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>plant</b> tissue from infestation by the insect. Consistently high levels of dhurrin accumulation may be required for this to occur. The possibility that endogenous grapevine gene expression is modulated in response to engineered dhurrin biosynthesis was investigated using microarray analysis of 1225 grapevine ESTs, but differences in patterns of gene expression associated with dhurrin-positive and dhurrin-negative phenotypes were not identified.

40|$|The tumour {{vasculature}} is {{an attractive}} target for cancer therapy because tumour growth and spread depend on these structures for oxygen and nutrient supply. Anti-vasculature therapy aims to cause rapid and selective shutdown of the established tumour vasculature, leading to secondary tumour cell death. In this study, we propose to employ an Antibody Guided Enzyme Nitrile Therapy (AGENT) approach to selectively target extra-domain B fibronectin (B-FN), which is abundantly expressed in tumour vasculature. A recombinant fusion protein, composed of the humanised BC- 1 single chain fragment (huBC 1 scFv) fused with a re-engineered human cytosolic β–glucosidase (rehCβG) enzyme, was investigated to target this antigen and generate cytotoxic cyanide molecules specifically within tumour sites. Naturally-occurring human β-glucosidase (hCβG) cannot hydrolyse the cyanogenic glycoside linamarin, to any significant level, but was chosen as a suitable candidate for site-directed mutagenesis due to its homology with a native <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>plant</b> enzyme, linamarase. Both huBC- 1 scFv and hCβG protein were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity and size exclusion chromatography. In vitro characterisation of the huBC- 1 scFv showed that it retained antigen-binding specificity of the parental antibody, Immunoglobulin-G HuBC- 1 towards the same antigen. Kinetic analysis of the wild type and a panel of mutant hCβGs showed that their catalytic activity was retained. Interestingly, one of the mutants, V 168 A hCβG, was shown to have increased cyanogenic activity towards linamarin. The Km was improved from 2. 23 ± 0. 03 mM to 0. 79 ± 0. 02 mM and the kcat from 0. 21 ± 0. 01 min- 1 to 5. 49 ± 0. 01 min- 1. Following this discovery, construction and expression of the fusion protein, scFv-rehCβG (wild-type and V 168 A) was carried out using different expression systems to compare the best strategy in constructing the fusion protein. The huBC- 1 scFv-hCβG fusion proteins were expressed cytosolically but as insoluble aggregates in inclusion bodies. Recovery of the fusion protein was made through refolding of the protein. Using the dilution method, the protein was solubilised and refolded, however it was functionally inactive. Another refolding method via dialysis experienced loss of the fusion protein. Final production of a cyanogenic scFv-hCβG requires further investigation by optimising the protein refolding protocol {{which could lead to}} further studies of AGENT.

40|$|The {{activities}} of the sulphurtransferases in different tissues of some poultry birds and the fruit bats that, presumably, feed on <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>plants</b> and/or their products have been measured. Thiosulphate sulphurtransferase (rhodanese, EC 2. 8. 1. 1) and 3 -mercaptopyruvate sulphurtransferase (EC 2. 8. 1. 2) were assayed in the crude extracts of some tissues (liver, kidney, lung, gizzard, heart and brain) of four domestic birds (local chicken, poultry chicken, pigeon and duck) and the fruit bat by {{the determination of the}} thiocyanate released from the reaction of potassium cyanide with respective sulphur donor by the Sorbo`s ferric-nitrate reagent. The results showed that rhodanese (RHD) and 3 -mercaptopyruvate sulphurtransferase (3 -MST) are present in all the tissues studied. In the chickens, duck and fruit bat, the liver had the highest level of rhodanese while in the pigeon; the activity was highest in the kidney. The brain or the gizzard contained the lowest activity of RHD in all the birds. On the other hand, 3 -mercaptopyruvate sulphurtransferase activities in the local chicken and pigeon were found to be highest in the liver, followed by the kidney. In poultry chicken, duck and the fruit bat, the level of the 3 -MST was found to be highest in the kidney, followed by the lung in poultry chicken and the liver in the duck. Moreover, determination of the cyanide content of some food materials in the locality, poultry rations and parts of plants found at the roosting site of a colony of fruit bats on the Obafemi Awolowo University (Nigeria) campus showed different levels ranging from 1. 82 ± 0. 37 to 15. 73 ± 0. 18 mg 100 g - 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{additional}} nitrogen on the toxicity and removal of ferrocyanide and ferricyanide by <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>plants</b> were investigated. Maize (Zea mays L. var. ZN 304) seedlings were {{grown in the}} hydroponic solutions with or without additional nitrogen, and amended with either potassium ferrocyanide or potassium ferricyanide at 25. 0 ± 0. 5 °C for 144 h. Various physiological parameters were monitored to determine {{the responses of the}} plant seedlings to the exposure of these two chemicals. A remarkable decrease in transpiration rate, biomass, shoot length, chlorophyll contents, and soluble proteins was evident for maize seedlings grown in the N-free hydroponic solutions spiked with either ferrocyanide or ferricyanide (P 0. 05). A higher removal of ferrocyanide than ferricyanide was registered in the N-free hydroponic solutions, but more ferricyanide than ferrocyanide was removed by maize grown in the N-containing nutrient solutions (P < 0. 01). Although roots of maize accumulated iron cyanides, more cyanide was recovered in plant materials of those grown in the N-containing hydroponic solutions than the N-free nutrient solutions (P < 0. 05). Mass balance analysis indicated {{that the majority of the}} iron cyanides removed from solution was assimilated by maize and additional nitrogen had a significantly negative impact on the uptake of both chemicals (P < 0. 01). Results of this study suggest that uptake and assimilation mechanisms for ferrocyanide and ferricyanide might be quite different in maize and the application of the external nitrogen has a substantial influence on the removal of both iron cyanides by plants. None of the iron cyanide complexes can serve as a sole nitrogen source to support maize growth. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Posteriormente a planta administrada imediatamente após a coleta resultou tóxica nas doses que variaram de 4 a 8 g/kg, em quatro caprinos. O animal que recebeu 8 g/kg apresentou sinais clínicos graves e recuperou-se após a administração de tiossulfato de sódio. Os demais caprinos apresentaram sinais menos graves e se recuperaram espontaneamente. Posteriormente, a planta foi administrada em diferentes épocas a 23 caprinos na dose de 10 g/kg. A planta foi significativamente mais tóxica (P Passiflora foetida is {{mentioned}} as a toxic plant by farmers in northeastern Brazil. This research aimed to establish the toxicity of P. foetida for goats, in different seasons of the year, and to determine its toxic compound. Initially, the plant collected two days before administration was non toxic at the daily dose of 40 g per kg of body weight (g/kg) given during two days. Furthermore, the plant was administered immediately after collection at a dose of 4 - 8 g/kg to four goats. The animal that ingested 8 g/kg showed severe clinical signs, but recovered after treatment with sodium thiosulfate. The other three goats showed mild signs of poisoning and recovered spontaneously. The plant was then administered during different seasons to 23 goats at the dose of 10 g/kg. The plant was significantly (P< 0. 05) more toxic {{during the dry season}} than during the rainy season; 11 out of 14 goats that received the plant in the dry season showed clinical signs, but only 3 out of 13 goats that ingested the plant during the rainy season had signs. All goats with clinical signs recovered after the administration of sodium thiosulfate. Clinical signs were apathy, tachycardia and tachypnea, jugular venous pulse, incoordination, bellowing, mydriasis, and sternal recumbence followed by lateral recumbence. Before each administration the plant was tested for cyanide by the picric acid paper test to estimate the cyanide concentration in the plant, which was defined as slight, moderate, high, and very high. Samples with slight reaction were not toxic, those with moderate reaction induced mild signs of poisoning, and those with high reaction induced severe clinical signs. Samples with very high concentrations of cyanide were not observed.

40|$|Cnidoscolus phyllacanthus (Euphorbiaceae), com nome popular de favela, é uma planta normalmente espinhosa comum na caatinga. É considerada como forrageira e os animais, principalmente durante a seca, consomem as folhas que estão ao seu alcance ou as folhas secas caídas. A intoxicação espontânea por esta planta é relatada por fazendeiros no semi-árido quando animais têm acesso a plantas ou ramos recentemente cortados. Diferentes partes da planta moídas e secas, diluídas em água, são utilizadas por caçadores para matar pássaros. Para determinar a toxicidade de C. phyllacanthus, folhas verdes de plantas sem espinhos foram administradas a uma cabra em pequenas quantidades por via oral. Após o consumo de 4, 7 g por kg de peso do animal (g/kg) a cabra apresentou taquicardia, taquipneia, dispnéia, nistagmo, opistótono e decúbito esterno {{abdominal}} seguido de decúbito lateral. A morte ocorreu 30 minutos após o começo dos sinais. Folhas frescas de plantas sem espinho foram administradas a 8 caprinos em doses de 0, 5 - 2, 5 g/kg sem que causassem sinais clínicos. Três animais apresentaram sinais clínicos após a ingestão de 3 g/kg. Os sinais clínicos foram similares aos observados na intoxicação por ácido cianídrico e dois animais tratados com uma solução de tiossulfato de sódio a 20 %, na dose de 0, 5 ml/kg se recuperaram rapidamente em seguida ao tratamento. O terceiro recuperou-se espontaneamente. Folhas das mesmas plantas foram secadas ao sol durante períodos varáveis de 8 - 30 dias. O caprino que ingeriu a planta que tinha sido secada por 8 dias morreu após a ingestão de 3 g/kg. O caprino que ingeriu a planta secada por 9 dias apresentou sinais clínicos após a ingestão de 1, 13 g/kg e se recuperou. Os caprinos que ingeriram a planta exposta ao sol por 10 - 29 dias apresentaram sinais clínicos após a ingestão de 3 g/kg e se recuperaram espontaneamente ou mediante tratamento com tiossulfato de sódio. O caprino que ingeriu a planta que tinha sido exposta ao sol por 30 dias não apresentou sinais clínicos. Em outro experimento, 4 caprinos receberam uma dose de 3 g/kg de folhas da planta triturada e seca ao sol por 1, 2, 3 e 4 dias. Os animais que receberam as folhas que tinham sido dessecadas por 1, 2 e 3 dias apresentaram sinais clínicos leves e se recuperaram espontaneamente. O caprino que ingeriu a planta exposta ao sol por 4 dias não apresentou sinais clínicos. Folhas da planta sem espinho utilizada nos experimentos, 20 amostras de folhas de plantas com espinhos, 5 amostras de raspa do caule e 2 amostras de frutos foram positivas para ao teste do papel prosódico para HCN. Após o final da época das chuvas, folhas maduras e secas, que cairiam das árvores em um curto período foram negativas para HCN. Esses resultados demonstraram que C. phyllacanthus é uma planta cianogênica que causa intoxicação após a ingestão da planta fresca. Após serem arrancadas as folhas íntegras mantêm a toxicidade por até 30 dias e as folhas moídas por até 3 dias. Com base nessa informação são recomendadas medidas de profilaxia da intoxicação para a utilização da planta como forrageira. Cnidoscolus phyllacanthus (Euphorbiaceae), {{with the}} common name favela, is a generally spiny plant of the Brazilian semiarid. Mainly {{during the dry season}} livestock browse its leaves from the shrubs or ingest the dry leaves fallen to the ground. Farmers report the spontaneous poisoning by this plant when livestock has access to shrubs or branches that had been cut. Different parts of the ground fresh plant, diluted in water, are used by people in the semiarid to hunt birds. To determine the toxicity of C. phyllacanthus, leaves of the non-spiny plant were fed by hand to a goat by putting small amount into its mouth. After the consumption of 4. 7 g/kg body weight, the goat had tachycardia, tachypnoea, dyspnoea, nystagmus, opisthotonos and sternal recumbence. The death occurred 30 minutes after the onset of clinical signs. Fresh leaves from the same plants were given to 8 goats at doses of 0. 5 - 2. 5 g/kg without causing clinical signs. Three goats showed clinical signs after the ingestion of 3 g/kg. Clinical signs were similar to those observed in cyanide poisoning. Two goats given 0. 5 mg/kg of a 20 % solution of sodium thiosulphate recovered immediately after treatment. Another goat recovered spontaneously. Leaves from the same plants were sun-dried during variable periods for 8 - 30 days, and then given to 8 goats. The goat that ingested the plant dried at the sun during 8 days died after the ingestion of 3 g/kg. The goat that ingested the plant, exposed to the sun for 9 days, showed clinical signs after the ingestion of 1. 13 g/kg, but recovered spontaneously. The goats that ingested the leaves exposed to the sun during 10 - 29 days showed clinical signs after the ingestion of 3 g/kg, but recovered spontaneously or after treatment with sodium thiosulphate. No clinical signs were observed in the goat that ingested the plant that had been exposed to the sun during 30 days. In another experiment ground leaves of the plant were dried at the sun for 1, 2, 3, and 4 days and given to goats at the dose of 3 g/kg. Goats that received the plant dried for 1, 2 or 3 days showed clinical signs, but recovered spontaneously. The goat that ingested the plant dried 4 days showed no clinical signs. Leaves of the spineless C. phyllacanthus used in the experiments, 20 samples of leaves from spiny plants, 3 samples of the ground plant stem, and 2 samples of fruits were positive with the picrosodic paper test for HCN. These results demonstrated that C. phyllacanthus is a <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>plant.</b> After being cut the entire leaves maintain their toxicity for up to 30 days, and the ground leaves for up to 3 days.

40|$|Because {{of their}} content of cyanogenic glycosides, many {{medicinal}} and food plants are toxic for man. If <b>plant</b> material containing <b>cyanogenic</b> glycosides gets disintegrated, cyanide is liberated by {{the action of}} different enzymes. Especially in developing countries, chronic poisoning by <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>plants</b> is a serious problem. Since probably more than 2500 plant species and also some insects contain cyanogenic glycosides, a rapid and precise method for the determination of these compounds should be developed. A biosensoric system based on an ammonia electrode and the enzyme cyanidase [EC 3. 5. 5. 1] seems to be an effective analytical method for this class of substances and a promising alternative to an ion-selective cyanide electrode. The key-step in the development of such a sensor is the selection of a suitable cyanidase, which has been previously reported for bacteria. This biosensor should be used for screening purposes {{as well as for the}} quality control of cyanogenic medicinal and food plants. For this reason, we have examined strains of the bacteria Rhodococcus rhodochrous, Alcaligenes xylosoxidans, and Acinetobacter spec [...] Strains were fed with increasing concentrations of potassium cyanide in order to induce cyanidase activity. After three cycles of selection, Alcaligenes xylosoxidans exhibited sufficient growth at cyanide concentrations up to 2 ´ 10 - 3 M. However, Rhodococcus rhodochrous showed excellent performance even at concentrations as high as 1 ´ 10 - 2 M cyanide. In addition, the latter bacterium is able to digest isovaleronitrile. No significant inhibition of growth was observed at concentrations up to 2 ´ 10 - 2 M isovaleronitrile. Because of cyanidase activity, Acinetobacter spec. was capable to utilize cyanide as nitrogen source. First measurements with immobilized cyanidase in a flow-through apparatus based on an ammonia electrode gave a detection limit at 0. 2 mg/L cyanide. The linear range of the calibration curve was between 0. 6 mg/L and 30 mg/L cyanide. 2. BIOSENSOR SYMPOSIU...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Ethyl {{carbamate}} (EC) is a multi-site carcinogen {{in experimental}} animals and probably carcinogenic to humans (IARC group 2 A). Traces of EC below health-relevant ranges naturally occur in several fermented foods and beverages, while higher concentrations above 1 mg/l are regularly detected in only certain spirits derived from <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>plants.</b> In Brazil this concerns the sugarcane spirit cachaça and the manioc (cassava) spirit tiquira, which both regularly exceed the national EC limit of 0. 15 mg/l. This study aims to estimate human exposure in Brazil {{and provide a}} quantitative risk assessment. Methods The human dietary intake of EC via alcoholic beverages was estimated based on WHO alcohol consumption data in combination with own surveys and literature data. This data comprises the EC contents of the different beverage groups cachaça, tiquira, other spirits, beer, wine, and unrecorded alcohol (as defined by the WHO; including alcohol which is not captured in routine government statistics nor taxed). The risk assessment was conducted using the margin of exposure (MOE) approach with benchmark doses obtained from dose-response modelling of animal experiments. Lifetime cancer risk was calculated using the T 25 dose descriptor. Results Considering differences between pot-still and column-still cachaça, its average EC content would be 0. 38 mg/l. Tiquira contained a considerably higher average EC content of 2. 34 mg/l. The whole population exposure from all alcoholic beverages was calculated to be around 100 to 200 ng/kg bw/day, with cachaça and unrecorded alcohol as the major contributing factors. The MOE was calculated to range between 400 and 2, 466, with the lifetime cancer risk at approximately 3 cases in 10, 000. An even higher risk may exist for binge-drinkers of cachaça and tiquira with MOEs of up to 80 and 15, respectively. Conclusions According to our risk assessment, EC poses a significant cancer risk for the alcohol-drinking population in Brazil, {{in addition to that}} of alcohol alone. Model calculations show that the implementation of the 0. 15 mg/l limit for cachaça would be beneficial, including an increase of the MOE by a factor between 3 to 6. The implementation of policy measures for tiquira and unrecorded alcohol also appears to be advisable. </p...|$|R
