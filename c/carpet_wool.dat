5|$|Coarse or <b>carpet</b> <b>wool</b> sheep {{are those}} with a medium to long length wool of {{characteristic}} coarseness. Breeds traditionally used for <b>carpet</b> <b>wool</b> show great variability, but the chief requirement is a wool that will not break down under heavy use (as would that of the finer breeds). As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders {{of this type of}} sheep are attempting to use a few of these traditional breeds for alternative purposes. Others have always been primarily meat-class sheep.|$|E
5|$|A Herdwick's grey fleece is {{not easily}} dyed, and is coarse, and so is best suited to use as <b>carpet</b> <b>wool.</b> The wool is also an {{excellent}} natural insulator; {{it is possible to}} buy sheets of fireproofed wool to fit as loft insulation. Herdwick lamb and mutton has a very distinct taste, and was even eaten at Queen Elizabeth II's 1953 coronation banquet. Herdwick ewes also commonly produce desirable market lambs and mules by cross-breeding with Suffolk, Cheviot, Charollais and Texel sheep.|$|E

2500|$|In most Persian rugs, {{the pile}} is of sheep's wool. Its {{characteristics}} and quality vary from each {{area to the}} next, depending on the breed of sheep, climatic conditions, pasturage, and the particular customs relating to when and how the wool is shorn and processed. Different areas of a sheep's fleece yield different qualities of wool, depending on the ratio between the thicker and stiffer sheep hair and the finer fibers of the wool. Usually, sheep are shorn in spring and fall. The spring shear produces wool of finer quality. The lowest grade of wool used in carpet weaving is [...] "skin" [...] wool, which is removed chemically from dead animal skin. Higher grades of Persian wool are {{often referred to as}} kurk, or kork wool, which is gained from the wool growing on the sheep's neck. Modern production also makes use of imported wool, e.g. Merino wool from New Zealand, because the high demand on <b>carpet</b> <b>wool</b> cannot be entirely met by the local production. Fibers from camels and goats are also used. Goat hair is mainly used for fastening the borders, or selvedges, of nomadic rugs like Baluch rugs, since it is more resistant to abrasion. Camel wool is occasionally used in Persian nomadic rugs. It is often dyed in black, or used in its natural colour. More often, wool said to be camel's wool turns out to be dyed sheep wool.|$|E
50|$|The {{analysis}} of <b>carpet</b> <b>wool</b> dyes was already suggested by Edwards in 1953, {{as a means}} of establishing the provenience of period carpets.

By comparing chromatograms of samples both of <b>carpet</b> <b>wool</b> and plants known to have been used for dyeing, the natural dye components were identified, and the dyeing procedures experimentally recreated subsequently.|$|E

[...] Further, the act increased the tariff on <b>carpet</b> <b>wool,</b> a wool of very low quality that is not produced in the US.

40|$|Increased use of wood can {{substitute}} more energy demanding products and thus {{contribute to a}} long-term solution to the global warming problem. The aim {{of this article is}} to provide an empirical study on this substitution impact, its cost-effectiveness, and which methodological assumptions that are of highest importance for the results obtained. We have made a case study where we compare use of various flooring materials. The results show that floor covering in solid oak causes lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than the other materials. The difference can be ranked in the following order, after their potential for reduction in GHG emissions: <b>Carpet</b> in <b>wool,</b> <b>carpet</b> in polyamide, vinyl, and linoleum. At 2 % pro anno discount rate, the avoided GHG emission in tons per m 3 of oak flooring used is 0. 1 – 1. 9 for linoleum, and 11. 8 – 15. 5 for <b>wool</b> <b>carpets.</b> Unless the solution in solid oak is on total less expensive over the lifetime of the building, only the price of avoided emissions from a substitution between solid oak and <b>carpet</b> in <b>wool</b> is reasonable, compared to present carbon fees. The assumptions that influence the result most are choice of discount rate, carbon fixation on forest area, and waste handling. Empirical case studies like this indicate GHG emission reduction potentials caused by substitution, but should be complemented by dynamic input/output analyses and econometric studies. To analyse the flow of CO 2 over time, they should also be linked to forest management models...|$|R
50|$|The varied carpet beetle, Anthrenus verbasci, attacks typical {{household}} objects. Carpet beetles {{are normally}} associated with {{things such as}} <b>carpets,</b> <b>wool,</b> furs, and any processed animal or plant food. Their appetite also includes dead insects, spiders, and even nectar and pollen. They are typically found throughout the United States and Canada. Females can lay up to 40 eggs {{and the number of}} larval instars range from 7-8 stages. The time it takes to become an adult varies from about eight months to a year. In addition, the adults can live around 2 to 6 weeks. This species varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of scales. On average, the adults are 2 to 3 mm in length and have scales that vary from white, brown, yellow, or even gray-yellow. The hairs of the larvae can cause allergic reactions such as contact dermatitis or blisters in humans who come into contact with the sharp tiny hairs.|$|R
