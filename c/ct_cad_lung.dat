40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{multiple}} annotation problem in medical application of cancer detection in digital images. The main assumption is that though images are labeled by many experts, {{the number of images}} read by the same expert is not large. Thus differing with the existing work on modeling each expert and ground truth simultaneously, the multi annotation information is used in a soft manner. The multiple labels from different experts are used to estimate the probability of the findings to be marked as malignant. The learning algorithm minimizes the Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence between the modeled probabilities and desired ones constraining the model to be compact. The probabilities are modeled by logit regression and multiple instance learning concept is used by us.

40|$|Lung {{segmentation}} in thoracic {{computed tomography}} (CT) scans is an important preprocessing step for computer-aided diagnosis (<b>CAD)</b> of <b>lung</b> diseases. This paper focuses on the segmentation of the lung field in thoracic CT images. Traditional lung segmentation is based on Gray level thresholding techniques, which often requires setting a threshold and is sensitive to image contrasts. In this paper, we present a fully automated method for robust and accurate lung segmentation, which includes a enhanced thresholding algorithm and a refinement scheme based on a texture-aware active contour model. In our thresholding algorithm, a histogram based image stretch technique is performed in advance to uniformly increase contrasts between areas with low Hounsfield unit (HU) values and areas with high HU in all CT images. This stretch step enables the following threshold-free segmentation, which is the Otsu algorithm with contour analysis. However, as a threshold based segmentation, it has common issues such as holes, noises and inaccurate segmentation boundaries that will cause problems in future <b>CAD</b> for <b>lung</b> disease detection. To solve these problems, a refinement technique is proposed that captures vessel structures and lung boundaries and then smooths variations via texture-aware active contour model. Experiments on 2, 342 diagnosis CT images demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method. Performance comparison with existing methods shows the advantages of our method...|$|R

Methods: A descriptive study was conducted from September to November 2013 in Internal Medicine Department of Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital Bandung. The study used 107 medical records that consisted of data about patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who were hospitalized between January to December 2012.

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the 2 -year prognostic value of cardiac computed tomography (CT) for predicting major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute chest pain. BackgroundCT has high potential for early triage of acute chest pain patients. However, there is a paucity of data regarding the prognostic value of CT in this ED cohort. MethodsWe followed 368 patients from the ROMICAT (Rule Out Myocardial Infarction Using Computer Assisted Tomography) trial (age 53 ± 12 years; 61 % male) who presented to the ED with acute chest pain, negative initial troponin, and a nonischemic electrocardiogram for 2 years. Contrast-enhanced 64 -slice CT was obtained during index hospitalization, and caregivers and patients remained blinded to the results. CT was assessed for the presence of plaque, stenosis (> 50 % luminal narrowing), and left ventricular regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA). The primary endpoint was MACE, defined as composite cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization. ResultsFollow-up was completed in 333 patients (90. 5 %) with a median follow-up period of 23 months. At the end of the follow-up period, 25 patients (6. 8 %) experienced 35 MACE (no cardiac deaths, 12 myocardial infarctions, and 23 revascularizations). Cumulative probability of 2 -year MACE increased across CT strata for coronary artery disease (CAD) (no CAD 0 %; nonobstructive CAD 4. 6 %; obstructive CAD 30. 3 %; log-rank p < 0. 0001) and across combined <b>CT</b> strata for <b>CAD</b> and RWMA (no stenosis or RWMA 0. 9 %; 1 feature—either RWMA [15. 0 %] or stenosis [10. 1 %], both stenosis and RWMA 62. 4 %; log-rank p < 0. 0001). The c statistic for predicting MACE was 0. 61 for clinical Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction risk score and improved to 0. 84 by adding <b>CT</b> <b>CAD</b> data and improved further to 0. 91 by adding RWMA (both p < 0. 0001). ConclusionsCT coronary and functional features predict MACE and have incremental prognostic value beyond clinical risk score in ED patients with acute chest pain.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new method of {{classifying}} the local structure types, such as nodules, vessels, and junctions, in thoracic CT scans. This classification {{is important in}} the context of computer aided detection (<b>CAD)</b> of <b>lung</b> nodules. The proposed method {{can be used as a}} post-process component of any <b>lung</b> <b>CAD</b> system. In such a scenario, the classification results provide an effective means of removing false positives caused by vessels and junctions thus improving overall performance. As main advantage, the proposed solution transforms the complex problem of classifying various 3 D topological structures into much simpler 2 D data clustering problem, to which more generic and flexible solutions are available in literature, and which is better suited for visualization. Given a nodule candidate, first, our solution robustly fits an anisotropic Gaussian to the data. The resulting Gaussian center and spread parameters are used to affine-normalize the data domain so as to warp the fitted anisotropic ellipsoid into a fixed-size isotropic sphere. We propose an automatic method to extract a 3 D spherical manifold, containing the appropriate bounding surface of the target structure. Scale selection is performed by a data driven entropy minimization approach. The manifold is analyzed for high intensity clusters, corresponding to protruding structures. Techniques involve EM clustering with automatic mode number estimation, directional statistics, and hierarchical clustering with a modified Bhattacharyya distance. The estimated number of high intensity clusters explicitly determines the type of pulmonary structures: nodule (0), attached nodule (1), vessel (2), junction (> 3). We show accurate classification results for selected examples in thoracic CT scans. This local procedure is more flexible and efficient than current state of the art and will help to improve the accuracy of general <b>lung</b> <b>CAD</b> systems...|$|R

Minimizing measurement variation by identifying robust CT imaging biomarkers and developing robust techniques for quantitative CT has implications for clinical trial management and for patient care. We investigated robustness with respect to two sources of measurement variation in quantitative CT: repeat-scan variation (reproducibility) and variation due to changing CT technical parameters. 	In this dissertation, we conducted two separate but related studies in the area of quantitative CT robustness. In the first, we characterized and compared the reproducibilities of several widely-accepted measures of emphysema by examining repeat CT images from a multi-center clinical trial taken one week apart. We investigated the influence of breathhold on reproducibility of emphysema measures. We also investigated variations in reproducibility characteristics across sites. Our results have implications for multi-center clinical trials that rely on accurate and reproducible measures of emphysema. 	In the second study, we investigated feature and classifier robustness with respect to slice thickness, reconstruction kernel, and tube current in the setting of classification of fibrotic interstitial lung disease (FILD). We developed a quantitative Robustness Index measure by examining the stability of imaging features across multiple systematic reconstructions of CT raw sinogram data. We proposed a novel Robustness-Driven Feature Selection (RDFS) method for identifying a subset of robust features, then used these features to develop a robust support vector classifier for lung structure and parenchymal abnormalities in FILD. We demonstrated the superior robustness of this classifier compared to a similar classifier that did not utilize RDFS.

40|$|Aims and Objectives: To {{determine}} the overall performance {{of an existing}} CAD algorithm with thin-section computed tomography (CT) in the detection of pulmonary nodules and to evaluate detection sensitivity at a varying range of nodule density, size, and location. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional prospective study was conducted on 20 patients with 322 suspected nodules who underwent diagnostic chest imaging using 64 -row multi-detector CT. The examinations were evaluated on reconstructed images of 1. 4 mm thickness and 0. 7 mm interval. Detection of pulmonary nodules, initially by a radiologist of 2 years experience (RAD) and later by <b>CAD</b> <b>lung</b> nodule software was assessed. Then, CAD nodule candidates were accepted or rejected accordingly. Detected nodules were classified based on their size, density, and location. The performance of the RAD and CAD system was compared with the gold standard that is true nodules confirmed by consensus of senior RAD and CAD together. The overall sensitivity and false-positive (FP) rate of CAD software was calculated. Observations and Results: Of the 322 suspected nodules, 221 were classified as true nodules on the consensus of senior RAD and CAD together. Of the true nodules, the RAD detected 206 (93. 2 %) and 202 (91. 4 %) by the CAD. CAD and RAD together picked up more number of nodules than either CAD or RAD alone. Overall sensitivity for nodule detection with the CAD program was 91. 4 %, and FP detection per patient was 5. 5 %. The CAD showed comparatively higher sensitivity for nodules of size 4 - 10 mm (93. 4 %) and nodules in hilar (100 %) and central (96. 5 %) location when compared to RAD′s performance. Conclusion: CAD performance was high in detecting pulmonary nodules including the small size and low-density nodules.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endovascular {{treatments}} are being increasingly used in acute ischemic stroke, and better tools {{are needed to}} determine which patients may benefit most from these techniques. We hypothesized that specific chronic diseases can be used, along with age and stroke severity, to predict endovascular stroke treatment outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 2 single-arm trials of a thrombectomy device, MERCI and Multi MERCI, were pooled for analysis. A predictive score was developed by using the independent contribution of variables in multivariable analysis. RESULTS: HTN, DM, and AFib were found to predict outcomes. These 3 conditions contribute equally to a CDS that predicts outcomes independent of other predictor variables, including age, stroke severity, and vessel recanalization. A 10 -level predictive score, the THRIVE score, which incorporates age, stroke severity, and the CDS, was developed. The THRIVE score strongly predicts outcome and mortality at 90 days. CONCLUSIONS: Specific chronic diseases influence poststroke outcomes among patients undergoing endovascular stroke treatment, independent of other predictors of outcome. The THRIVE score reflects the contributions of chronic disease, age, and stroke severity and strongly predicts endovas-cular stroke treatment outcomes.

Virtual dual-energy imaging [...] improved the performance of CAD systems in chest radiography. Observer performance studies demonstrated that CAD systems improved the diagnosticic performance of radiologists in detectoin [...] and diagnosis [...] of lung nodules in CT.|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} an original, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) software that subtracts the initial thoracic vertebral three-dimensional computed tomography (3 D-CT) {{image from the}} follow-up 3 D-CT image. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the efficacy of this CAD software during screening for vertebral metastases on follow-up CT images of primary lung cancer patients. The interpretation experiment included 30 sets of follow-up CT scans in primary lung cancer patients and was performed by two readers (readers A and B), who each had 2. 5 years' experience reading CT images. In 395 vertebrae from C 6 to L 3, 46 vertebral metastases were identified as follows: osteolytic metastases (n = 17), osteoblastic metastases (n = 14), combined osteolytic and osteoblastic metastases (n = 6), and pathological fractures (n = 9). Thirty-six lesions were in the anterior component (vertebral body), and 10 lesions were in the posterior component (vertebral arch, transverse process, and spinous process). The area under the curve (AUC) by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and the sensitivity and specificity for detecting vertebral metastases were compared with and without CAD for each observer. Reader A detected 47 abnormalities on <b>CT</b> images without <b>CAD,</b> and 33 of them were true-positive metastatic lesions. Using CAD, reader A detected 57 abnormalities, and 38 were true positives. The sensitivity increased from 0. 717 to 0. 826, and on ROC curve analysis, AUC with CAD was significantly higher than that without CAD (0. 849 vs. 0. 902, p = 0. 021). Reader B detected 40 abnormalities on <b>CT</b> images without <b>CAD,</b> and 36 of them were true-positive metastatic lesions. Using CAD, reader B detected 44 abnormalities, and 39 were true positives. The sensitivity increased from 0. 783 to 0. 848, and AUC with CAD was nonsignificantly higher than that without CAD (0. 889 vs. 0. 910, p = 0. 341). Both readers detected more osteolytic and osteoblastic metastases with CAD than without CAD. Our temporal 3 D-CT subtraction CAD software easily detected vertebral metastases on the follow-up CT images of lung cancer patients regardless of the osteolytic or osteoblastic nature of the lesions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we develop}} a lung area {{extraction}} technique from X-ray computed tomography (CT) images for computer-aided diagnosis (<b>CAD)</b> systems. In <b>lung</b> cancer cases, pulmonary nodules are typical pathological changes and thus {{they are the}} target to be detected by CAD systems. The isolated nodules can be detected more easily by CAD systems developed previously, while previous CAD systems are often hard to detect non-isolated nodules. The extraction technique can then be used for transforming the non-isolated pulmonary nodules connected to {{the walls of the}} chest into isolated ones. The technique proposed here is based on an active contour model, but such model is often trapped into a local optimum solution. To avoid the local optimum solutions, an essential core of the proposed technique is to select an appropriate initial contour by using an anatomical feature of the lung shape in X-ray CT slices. Some experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed technique for assisting the CAD systems to detect non-isolated nodules more accurately...|$|R
30|$|The {{patients}} were interviewed, {{and the medical}} records were reviewed to customize the cardiac <b>CT</b> indication. Pretest <b>CAD</b> probability and coronary heart disease risk were estimated using the published AUC methods. Two radiologists (10 and 6 {{years of experience in}} cardiac CT) independently classified the AUC rating of each patient as appropriate, uncertain, inappropriate or not classifiable. The presence and number of coronary segments with significant CAD were also evaluated. Two experienced radiologists consensually interpreted the coronary CT angiogram including axial source-, curved multiplanar reformation images, and angiographic view. Significant CAD was defined as > 50 % stenosis. We also recorded the machine-generated volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) (mGy) per examination for imaging during cardiac CT. The CTDIvol averages the radiation dose over the center slice of a CT study comprising multiple parallel slices. The data acquisition range and the dose-length product were calculated on the basis of CTDIvol and the data acquisition range. Finally, the effective radiation dose of the chest was calculated with the equation: effective dose = dose-length product × 0.014 (Hausleiter et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} nuclear {{cardiology}} is witnessing {{growing interest in}} the use of cardiac PET for the evaluation of patients with coro-nary artery disease (CAD). The available evidence suggests that myocardial perfusion PET provides an accurate means for diagnosing obstructive CAD, which appears superior to SPECT especially in the obese and in those undergoing pharmacologic stress. The ability to record changes in left ventricular function from rest to peak stress and to quantify myocardial perfusion (in mL/min/g of tissue) provides an added advantage over SPECT for evaluating multivessel CAD. There is growing and consistent evidence that gated myocardial perfusion PET also provides clinically useful risk stratification. Although the intro-duction of hybrid PET/CT technology offers the exciting possibil-ity of assessing the extent of anatomic <b>CAD</b> (<b>CT</b> coronary angiography) and its functional consequences (ischemic burden) in the same setting, there are technical challenges in the imple-mentation of CT-based transmission imaging for attenuation correction. Nonetheless, this integrated platform for assessing anatomy and biology offers a great potential for translating ad-vances in molecularly targeted imaging into humans.
