50|$|Copper {{used for}} the {{manufacture}} of transformer windings {{is in the form}} of wire for small products and strip for larger equipment. For small products, the wire must be strong enough to be wound without breakage, yet flexible enough to provide close-packed windings. Strip products must be of good surface quality so that insulating enamels do not break down under voltage. Good ductility is essential for the strip to be formed and packed while good strength is needed to withstand the high electro-mechanical stresses set up under occasional short-circuit conditions. <b>Copper</b> <b>winding</b> <b>wires</b> in transformers are compatible with all modern insulation materials, such as lacquer and enamel. Lacquers permit the close spacing of windings to give best efficiency in the coils.|$|R

50|$|Electric hair {{clippers}} {{work in the}} same way as manual ones, but are driven by an electric motor which makes the blades oscillate from side to side. They have gradually displaced manual {{hair clippers}} in many countries. Three different motor types are used in clipper production: magnetic, rotary and pivot. Rotary style may be driven by direct current or alternating current electricity source. Both magnetic and pivot style clippers use magnetic forces derived from <b>winding</b> <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> around steel. Alternating current creates a cycle attracting and relaxing to a spring to create the speed and torque to drive the clipper cutter across the combing blade.|$|R
40|$|In this project, an {{experimental}} {{set up for}} ac susceptibility measurement, is designed and fabricated. The setup comprises of, primary coil, secondary coil and sample holder. The basic principle of the setup is “mutual induction”. <b>Copper</b> <b>wire</b> <b>winding</b> is done over secondary and primary coil uniformly. When current passed, the coil gets magnetised which in turn magnetizes the sample. The setup is fabricated both for room temperature and high temperature susceptibility measurement. A sample is prepared whose susceptibility is to be measured. Cobalt Ferrite, a ferrimagnetic sample is chosen for the purpose. The sample is made by auto combustion sol-gel method.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{mechanical}} construction process of an electric motor demonstrator of Mauritz Andersson's design. Several design issues have been addressed, primarily the winding of the coils, the fixation of the coils and how toconnect the coils to the power electronics. Some mechanical parts have been constructed, and some preparations for creating the power electronics have been examined. The coils have been manufactured by using enameled <b>copper</b> <b>wire,</b> <b>winding</b> it with acrank onto a winding tool. The coil have been fixated with adhesive and removed from the winding tool. Several different adhesives have been examined, where 2 -component heat transfer adhesive from Fischer Electronics and Polyester resin ULTIMEG showed {{to be the most}} prominent ones. The layout of the winding tool have been given much attention, and the winding path of the enamelled wire have been carefully planned, which increased the number of revolutions from 76 to 90...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} Swedish manufacturers of insulated <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> and the market forces surrounding the industry between 1945 and 1980. As part of the chain of subcontractors, the <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> industry was linked to all three major electro-technical manufacturers of the time, ASEA, Electrolux and LM Ericsson. The Wallenberg Group’s initiatives to create boundaries for what the manufacturers were to produce also came to influence manufacturers of <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> and their subsequent focus on high- and low voltage current products and systems respectively. Increasing sales of electro-technical products that became the norm in industry {{as well as in}} private homes after 1945 to a great extent created the demand for <b>winding</b> <b>wire.</b> In response to an increasing demand for <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> Ernst Dahrén developed the family company in Jonslund, a predominantly rural area that lacked job opportunities. The specialisation of <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> manufacturing enabled the company to carefully select loyal employees who accepted lower wages and were willing to work in three shifts, thereby creating a competitive advantage for the company. Product pricing was governed by the prices of copper and aluminium as well as costs and discounts for the rod wire used in the production of <b>winding</b> <b>wire.</b> Together with Ernst Dahrén’s entrepreneurial and patriarchal leadership style which highly influenced the company culture, the family’s tendency to re-invest profits became an important foundation for the company’s autonomy and expansion until its acquisition by the ASEA in 1973...|$|R
5000|$|Halfwound strings, ground wound strings, or {{pressure}} wound strings are a {{cross between}} roundwound and flatwound. Such strings are usually made by <b>winding</b> round <b>wire</b> around a round or hex core first, then polishing, grinding (thus the name, ground wound) or pressing the exterior part of the winding until it is practically flat. This results in the flat, comfortable playing feel of flatwounds, along with less squeaking, with a brightness generally between roundwounds and flatwounds. The polishing process removes {{almost half of the}} <b>winding</b> <b>wire's</b> mass; thus, to compensate for it, manufacturers use <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> of a heavier gauge. Because of the extra manufacturing process involved they are normally more expensive than roundwounds, but less than flatwounds.|$|R

40|$|Amorphous core {{transformers}} are {{in developing}} stage; {{they are considered}} as energy efficient transformers. Cost of amorphous core transformer is about 20 to 30 per cent {{higher than that of}} a conventional transformer of same KVA rating. Among several parameters, cost of winding material is a parameter, on which cost of a transformer depends. In a transformer, the cost of winding material may be up to 28 per cent of overall cost of a transformer. Cost of a transformer may be reduced if aluminum winding is adopted in place of copper winding; aluminum is lighter in weight and cheaper in price, compared to <b>copper</b> <b>winding.</b> Here, a comparative study is presented for an amorphous core transformer with <b>copper</b> <b>winding</b> versus aluminum winding, in terms of cost efficiency and mechanical forces.

The layer is formed {{in such a manner}} that the thermal resistance between the layer and the units is small relative to the resistance of the wire between end windings and the point.
