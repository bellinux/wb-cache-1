Electrons generated by oxidation of the reduced substrate at the anode flow to the cathode through the circuit, resulting in the reduction of oxygen (Logan 2009). In most cases, MFCs employ microflora rather than a pure culture because mixed cultures can utilize complex organic materials as substrates and enhance anodophilic electron transfer due to interspecies connections (Logan et al. 2006). The effects of system architecture and operational parameters on electricity generation in MFCs have been intensively studied (Logan et al. 2006).

Waste activated sludge provided a bacterial consortium predisposed to the solubilization of particulate matter and utilization of substrates commonly found in wastewater. Dissolved oxygen and ferricyanide were used as the electron acceptors in the <b>catholytes.</b> Microbial fuel cell comparisons were made while operating under identical conditions but using the two different electron acceptors. Comparisons were based on the electricity production observed during MFC operation, wastewater quality of the waste activated sludge anolytes and the community level physiological profiling of the microbial communities in the anolytes. Electrons liberated during substrate utilization in the anodic chamber traveled to the cathodic chamber where they reduced the electron acceptors. The anode and cathode chambers were connected by a Nafion ® proton exchange membrane to allow for cation migration. Various soluble carbon sources were dosed to the microbial fuel cells at measured intervals during operation via direct injection to the anolyte. During bovine serum albumin dosing, average power production levels reached 0. 062 mW and 0. 122 mW for the dissolved oxygen microbial fuel cell and the ferricyanide microbial fuel cell, respectively. These were 100 % and 25 % greater than the power production levels observed {{throughout the rest of the}} study. Increases in current production were observed following the dosing of sodium acetate, glucose and bovine serum albumin. No increase in current was observed following glycerol dosing. Sodium acetate dosing triggered an immediate response, while glucose and bovine serum albumin responded in approximately 2 minutes. A chemical oxygen demand mass balance was calculated for both microbial fuel cells. The lack of balance closure was attributed to unmeasured methane production. An accumulation of particulate waste activated sludge components was observed for both microbial fuel cells. The anolyte pH during operation was typically less than waste activated sludge pH, which was attributed to volatile fatty acid accumulation in the anolytes during fermentation processes. Community level physiological profiling was accomplished through the analysis of ecological data obtained with BIOLOG ® ECOplates. Samples were plated and analyzed under anaerobic conditions, mimicking the environment in the anode chamber of the MFCs. ECOplate data were transformed by a logarithmic function prior to principle component analysis.

40|$|The {{hydrogen}} production rate in a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) using a non-buffered saline <b>catholyte</b> (NaCl) can be optimized through proper {{control of the}} initial anolyte pH and <b>catholyte</b> NaCl concentration. The highest hydrogen yield of 3. 3 ± 0. 4 mol H 2 /mole acetate and gas production rate of 2. 2 ± 0. 2 m 3 H 2 /m 3 /d were achieved here with an initial anolyte pH = 9 and <b>catholyte</b> NaCl concentration of 98 mM. Further increases in the salt concentration substantially reduced the anolyte pH to as low as 4. 6, resulting in reduced MEC performance due to pH inhibition of exoelectrogens. Cathodic hydrogen recovery was high (rcat > 90 %) as hydrogen consumption by hydrogenotrophic methanogens was prevented by separating the anode and cathode chambers using a membrane. These {{results show that the}} MEC can be optimized for {{hydrogen production}} through proper choices in the concentration of a non-buffered saline <b>catholyte</b> and initial anolyte pH in two chamber MECs.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{illuminate}} the catholyte-regulated catalytic oxidation performance and mechanism of the FeOOH-catalyzed heterogeneous electro-Fenton (Hetero-EF) system operating in a divided electrolytic cell. Depending on pH evolution with electrolysis time, {{the effect of the}} <b>catholyte</b> type on the H 2 O 2 yield and current efficiency was investigated on an anthraquinone@electrochemically reduced grapheme oxide nanohybrid cathode. Based on the physicochemical characterization of the supported FeOOH nanoparticles, {{it was found that the}} Hetero-EF system exhibits the synchronous role of coupled adsorption and electrocatalytic oxidation for rhodamine B (RhB) degradation, with a higher apparent rate constant in MgSO 4 <b>catholyte</b> and a higher mineralization rate in Na 2 SO 4 <b>catholyte.</b> The catholyte-regulated catalytic oxidation mechanism was proposed according to radical scavenging experiments. In MgSO 4 <b>catholyte,</b> the Hetero-EF process follows a classic Haber-Weiss mechanism mediated by the dissolved iron ions and surface iron species to generate •OH, while in Na 2 SO 4 <b>catholyte,</b> the catalytic decomposition of H 2 O 2 by surface iron species and the deactivation of ≡FeIII-OH · H 2 O 2 complex to form HO• 2 (O•− 2), •OH and ferryl species (≡FeIV = O). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements revealed the desirable stability of Hetero-EF system after multiple reutilizations. © The Author(s) 2015.

40|$|A temperature- and {{time-dependent}} {{mathematical model}} for the operation of a laboratory-scale copper electrowinning cell based on reactive electrodialysis (RED) has been developed. The model is zero-dimensional. The cathodic reaction was copper electrodeposition and the anodic reaction was ferrous to ferric ion oxidation. The <b>catholyte</b> was aqueous cupric sulphate and the anolyte was aqueous ferrous sulphate, both in sulphuric acid. <b>Catholyte</b> and anolyte were separated by an electrodialytic anion membrane. The model predicts the effect of temperature and time on: (a) cathodic and anodic kinetics, (b) speciation of <b>catholyte</b> and anolyte, (c) transport phenomena in the electrolytes and (d) ion transport through the membrane. Model calibration and validation were carried out. Its predictions are in good agreement with experiments for: amount of deposited copper, amount of produced Fe(III) species, cell voltage and specific energy consumption...|$|E
40|$|New {{original}} {{a direct}} borohydrid fuel cell divided by bipolar membrane with H 2 O 2 co-generation was development. It was established that application of bipolar membrane enables to keep constant pH in <b>catholyte</b> within 2. 5 - 3. 2 limits, which {{allowed us to}} carry out treatment of water polluted by organic compounds in fuel cell <b>catholyte</b> by electro-Fenton and photo-electro-Fenton methods. The electromotive force of borohydrid fuel cell is 1. 1 V. Most efficient methods was photo-electro-Fenton, which enabled to decrease COD (start COD = 500 ppm) of catholytes containing phenol, valsaren, BI- 58 and valsaciper to 30, 11, 9 and 3 ppm, correspondingly after 180 min treatment. At the increase of <b>catholyte</b> temperature from 200 C to 400 C {{in the same period}} phenol COD fell to 5 ppm...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} {{the suitability of}} the Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) for generation of electrical power with a simultaneous synthesis of active <b>catholyte</b> {{in the form of}} caustic solution. The active solution formed inside a terracotta based MFC reactor was a product of self-powered wastewater electrolysis utilizing i) wastewater with added sodium acetate as a carbon source and ii) neat urine. The <b>catholyte</b> solution that has been actively synthesized was harvested and used for precipitation of heavy metals such as: iron, copper and zinc showing its suitability for use in electro-coagulation (electro-flocculation). This proposed alternative approach to self-powered electrocoagulation is based on electrochemically formed caustic <b>catholyte</b> within the inner cathode chamber of the MFC and then used ex situ to form metal hydroxides that precipitate out from heavy metal solutions...|$|E
