The crack-cocaine epidemic also affected Greater Chatham. In 2009, Chathamite Roland Burris is appointed to the US Senate to fill the empty seat left by former President Barack Obama.|$|E
50|$|Kenny Goodman ran a {{thriving}} general store business for some 20 years. During {{the last years}} of his tenure, he began to see the decline of the traditional general store. Automobiles became common place, new and better roads were built and <b>chain</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> and department stores were constructed in Boone and West Jefferson. With this new accessibility to the outside world people began traveling to town to buy their goods. Mr. Goodman decided to sell the store that had been the center of trade for so many years.|$|E

50|$|The {{success of}} Piggly Wiggly was phenomenal, {{so much so}} that other {{independent}} and <b>chain</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> changed to self-service in the 1920s and 1930s. At its peak in 1932 (see Clarence Saunders), the company operated 2,660 stores and posted annual sales in excess of $180 million. In November 1922, Saunders attempted a squeeze on the substantial short interest in the stock, running the share price up from 40 to 120 and profiting by millions on paper. The Stock Exchange Governors responded by deciding that a corner had been established in Piggly Wiggly and removed the stock from the Board eventually forcing Saunders to turn over his assets to the banks that had financed his leveraged position. Saunders reputedly lost nine million dollars in the attempted corner.|$|E
50|$|Commercial uses are {{clustered}} {{at the main}} crossroads of Petrovitsky Road and 140th Way SE. The commercial area is supported by an Albertsons and Safeway {{on either side of}} Petrovitsky, and a large series of local retail and office establishments. The area adjacent to the library has the most developed businesses (retail, personal and professional services), which are generally located in major shopping centers anchored by the <b>chain</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>stores.</b> Closures, vacancies and some new business have created a changing landscape in the commercial districts. There are two large shopping centers in Fairwood, located on 140th: Fairwood Square located north of Petrovitsky and Fairwood Center south of Petrovitsky. Fairwood Plaza, a strip mall is located further east of Fairwood Square to the north of Petrovitsky. A smaller strip mall, the Cascade Center contains a bowling alley and a few chain stores, it had featured a hooters but it recently closed down.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s, Pouillon {{moved to}} the United States with her husband, a French journalist. This move {{highlighted}} the stark contrast between European food, farm, and open-air market cultures versus the supermarket culture of American post-World War II. “At the stores here it was amazing {{to see all the}} prepackaged and frozen food. Nothing depended on the season. Pepperidge Farm was like gourmet bread. The produce department was the smallest section in the store.” As the mother of young children in the 1960s and 1970s, Pouillon did daily shopping and cooking for her family. This time coincided with the modern emergence of food cooperatives in the 1960s providing alternative, organic and whole food options to traditional <b>chain</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> and food processing.“I started to look for ethnic markets where I could find French bread, good olive oil and cheeses. It was the hippie time and co-ops were forming, which had better products; I cooked at home using these ingredients. I started driving to nearby farms in search of quality products. We had no money at the time and it was an epicurean wasteland in DC then, with only one or two good restaurants. I got really into cooking and we entertained a lot because it {{was the best way to}} have social time, given the circumstances.” ...|$|E

50|$|George Hartford {{revolutionized}} retailing. A&P reduced {{prices and}} made profit by heavy advertising and promotion. The company {{was one of}} the first marketers to use brand names when it started selling tea under the Thea Nectar label. Gilman and Hartford purchased damaged tea that cost relatively little and mixed it to create a black tea with a green tea taste that was considered by the public a specialty tea. In turn A&P was then able to sell Thea Nectar for less than the competitor’s special tea. For customers who could not reach one of their stores, the company provided “tea clubs,” where groups of people - either as a social group or as a business - could have tea shipped to them from the A&P for a third of the price. The tea clubs proved immensely popular, eliciting orders from Vermont to Wisconsin. The company also offered incentives to its customers, such as premiums. Based on the amount of products purchased, the customer received a gift from the A&P. Eventually, these premiums became based on stamps that were collected with each purchase and could be turned in for anything from lithographs to glassware. In the 1870s, Hartford expanded the company by opening stores outside of New York. During the next decade, Hartford and his sons expanded the product line to create the first <b>chain</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>stores.</b> Despite its size, A&P was run like a small family business and promotions exclusively took place from within the company. Hartford also instituted a pension plan that allowed employees to invest in company stock that they could retain after retirement.|$|E
40|$|West Bloomington, Illinois is {{considered}} a food desert by the United States Department of Agriculture. Food deserts are a rising problem as <b>chain</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> increasingly move outside of inner cities forcing these residents to make food purchases at smaller stores where prices are higher, quality is lower, and fresh produce is limited (Hendrickson et al. 2006, Walker et al. 2010, Wrigley et al. 2002). This study examined how West Bloomington can utilize its proximity to Central Illinois farms to aid in overcoming the impacts of a food desert. Through surveying West Bloomington residents and local farmers, in addition to interviewing others interested in food justice, solutions to food deserts {{were found to be}} multifaceted, and, gleaning at the Bloomington Farmers’ Market (collecting leftover produce), in conjunction with a mobile grocery store, were identified as feasible means to provide West Bloomington residents access to low-cost produce. Through these solutions, issues of access to produce, affordability of produce and interest in produce can be better addressed so as to provide ‘water’ to the West Bloomington food desert...|$|E
40|$|Lack of {{accessibility}} to healthy foods {{is a factor}} associated {{with the increase in}} obesity, diabetes, and other negative health consequences. While programs such as WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) provide supplemental nutritional access to healthy foods, few organic food items are included in the WIC authorized food list. Government programs and policy makers that provide to the most vulnerable populations are concerned about equal availability of healthy foods. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare variability and cost of organic food items in 24 large <b>chain</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> located in high- and low-income areas. The theoretical concepts of social production of disease and political economy of health guided the study. The study used a quantitative research design to investigate the relationship between neighborhood income level and the consumer nutrition environment. Organic food scores were compared by neighborhood income level using t test and ANOVA. There were significant differences in availability and variability scores of healthy organic foods between high- and low-income neighborhood stores. Organic food items, specifically 15...|$|E

40|$|In {{an effort}} to deconcentrate poverty, Atlanta is {{attempting}} {{to become the first}} city in the U. S. to completely eliminate public housing by relocating ≈ 10, 000 residents. Research has shown that the health status of public housing residents is worse than any other population. Evidence also suggests that there is an inverse relationship between neighborhood availability of healthy, affordable foods and diet intake. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the price, availability, and quality of food items in the public housing residents’ communities, before and after relocation. Using Nutrition Environment Measures Survey (NEMS), a total of 42 food store audits were conducted in pre- and post-relocation neighborhoods. The prices in post-relocation middle <b>chain</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> were significantly cheaper for total frozen dinners (p = 0. 042), baked goods (p = 0. 017), and potato chips (p = 0. 035).

40|$|Background: Access to food is {{an issue}} that not only deals with the safety of food that people consume, but also entails the {{availability}} and access of food in certain areas or neighborhoods. Eating behavior is highly complex and results from the interplay of multiple influences across different contexts. An ecological approach is useful to guide research efforts related to eating behavior because of the emphasis on multilevel links. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the access to, availability, and price of food in various food outlets of two zip codes in Atlanta, Georgia, which differ in socioeconomic status (SES) and racial background. It is hypothesized that low SES communities have a lower availability and higher price of healthy foods, and also have a higher number of small grocery stores, convenience stores and gas station food markets. Methodology: Primary data were collected for this study. Two zip codes were selected in the Metropolitan Atlanta area, 30318 and 30329. Frequencies and independent sample t-test for small sample sizes was used to determine whether the items of the market basket was significantly different for the two zip codes. Results: The Market Basket Survey showed significant disparities in areas with convenience stores. People who may have access to convenience stores before will pay more for healthy food items, if they are available at all. Fruit and vegetables were least likely to be available in convenience stores. In terms of small food stores, items were available in national brands, which are more costly than <b>chain</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> or supermarkets. The hypothesis was rejected. Conclusion: Maintaining a nutritious diet is impossible if healthy foods are not available; and it is not realistic to expect food retailers to address the problem without community support and investment. Local Governments and communities should assess needs to improve access to healthy foods and develop action plans to address deficiencies identified in their assessments...|$|E
