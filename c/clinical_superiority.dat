50|$|N-Desmethylclozapine (NDMC), or norclozapine, {{is a major}} active {{metabolite}} of the atypical {{antipsychotic drug}} clozapine. Unlike clozapine, it possesses intrinsic activity at the D2/D3 receptors, and acts as a weak partial agonist at these sites similarly to aripiprazole and bifeprunox. Notably, NDMC {{has also been shown}} to act as a potent and efficacious agonist at the M1 and δ-opioid receptors, unlike clozapine as well. It was hypothesized that on account of these unique actions, NDMC might underlie the <b>clinical</b> <b>superiority</b> of clozapine over other antipsychotics. However, clinical trials found NMDC itself ineffective in the treatment of schizophrenia. This may be because it possesses relatively low D2/D3 occupancy compared to 5-HT2 (<15% versus 64-79% at a dose of 10-60 mg/kg s.c. in animal studies). In any case, though not useful in the treatment of positive symptoms on its own, it cannot be ruled out that NDMC may contribute to the efficacy of clozapine on cognitive and/or negative symptoms.|$|E

40|$|Echinocandins {{have made}} a {{significant}} impact {{in the treatment of}} select invasive fungal infections, most notably invasive candidiasis and aspergillosis. However, treatment outcomes for such infections are still less than optimal, prompting an examination of dosing and administration techniques in an attempt to exploit known pharmacodynamic properties and improve outcomes. Echinocandins generally exhibit concentration-dependent, fungicidal activity against Candida spp. and fungistatic activity against Aspergillus spp. However, increasing drug concentrations of echinocandins above the organism’s MIC may result in a paradoxical increase in fungal growth as demonstrated in some in vitro and in vivo models (known most commonly as the ‘Eagle effect’). Therefore, the potential impact of dose escalations on improving the clinical efficacy of echinocandins based on in vitro and animal models are uncertain and are still being evaluated.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle atrophy and {{decreased}} expression of slow fibers contribute to exercise capacity limitation in Chronic Heart Failure (CHF). Pro-inflammatory cytokines and free radicals worsen muscle damage. In CHF sarcomeric proteins are oxidized with reduction of muscle twitch efficiency, and VO(2) -max. Beta-blockers with anti-oxidative capacity such as carvedilol {{have been shown}} to prevent contractile protein oxidation in CHF rats. Recently a new class of beta-blockers with NO donor activity has been introduced and approved for the treatment of CHF. Since a <b>clinical</b> clear <b>superiority</b> of a beta-blocker has never been shown, we compared nebivolol, that possesses NO donor activity, with bisoprolol, looking at possible differences in skeletal muscle that may have an impact on muscle function and exercise capacity in humans. We therefore studied skeletal muscle apoptosis and wastage, sarcomeric protein composition and oxidation, and muscle efficiency. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the monocrotaline rat model of CHF we compared nebivolol a beta-blocker with vasodilative properties mediated by NO production, with bisoprolol. Nebivolol prevented protein oxidation, while bisoprolol did it only partially, as demonstrated by the oxyblot analysis (Oxy/RP values) (0. 90 +/- 0. 14 Controls.; 1. 7 +/- 0. 14 CHF; 1. 1 +/- 0. 05 bisoprolol; 0. 82 +/- 0. 17 nebivolol low; 0. 62 +/- 0. 10 nebivolol high). Only nebivolol improved twitch force production and relaxation. Nebivolol prevented fibers shift towards fast isoforms, atrophy, decreased apoptosis and sphingosine levels. CONCLUSIONS: Nebivolol seems better than bisoprolol in CHF by decreasing apoptosis and cytokines induced muscle wastage, preventing fibers shift and protein oxidation. Nebivolol by stimulating NO generation may have prevented protein oxidation. It could be speculated that ROS release, pro-inflammatory cytokines production and NF-kappa-B activation may play a key role. These positive changes could produce a favorable impact on exercise capacity in man...|$|R

This study systematically reviewed literature regarding current techniques for processing fat grafts. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Cinahl, and Cochrane databases were searched until August 2015. Studies comparing different fat grafting processing techniques were included. Outcomes were viability of adipocytes, number of adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASC) and growth factors in vitro, volume {{and quality of}} the graft in animal studies, and satisfaction and volume retention in human studies. Results: Thirty-five studies were included. Adipocyte viability and ASC numbers were the best using the gauze/towel technique (permeability principle) compared to centrifugation. With regard to centrifugation, the pellet contained more ASCs compared to the middle layer. The animal studies' and patients' satisfaction results were not distinctive. The only study assessing volume retention in humans showed that a wash filter device performed significantly better than centrifugation.

40|$|There are {{two ways}} to perform {{therapeutic}} plasmapheresis (TP). The simplest form is therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) where the blood taken from the patient is separated in a centrifuge into cells and plasma. While the plasma is discarded, the cells together with a substitution fluid (e. g. fresh frozen plasma; albumin solution) are returned to the patient. The second form of treatment specifically removes the pathogenic substance alone by filtration on a specific substrate. A column is attached to the plasma line, selectively eliminating the pathogenic molecule and returning the patient’s own plasma. Nowadays, practitioners of centrifugal TP tend to be hematologists and transfusionists, whilst the membrane-based approach appeals primarily to nephrologists or other specialists (experts in hemodialysis, surgeons). Adsorption, an apheresis technique conceivably with the highest selectivity, is founded on the principles of affinity chromatography in which plasma is passed through an insoluble matrix bound firmly to a ligand. The ligands could be either comparatively nonspecific chemical binders, e. g. heparin or charcoal, or specific recombinant protein antigens or monoclonal antibodies. A wide range of medical disorders of varying pathologies and end-organ involvement may be managed by TPE (1). TPE has still a crucial role in emergency. Critical care units staffed by highly trained medical and paramedical personnel using highly technical and sophisticated equipment might be supported by the provision of TPE. Timing is frequently of the essence in disorders in which plasma exchange (PEX) has a role, with decisions being based on a set of facts or clinical circumstances which may be rapidly changing (2) (Table 1). Severe Hypertriglyceridemia (sHTG) could be associated with acute pancreatitis (AP), a fatal and dreaded complication.   Technique Pathology Emergency Long-term Plasma-Exchange Sepsis, MODS X   Plasma-Exchange Hyperlipidemic Pancreatitis Hyperchylomicronemia X   Plasma-Exchange Familial Hypercholesterolemia   X Lipoprotein Apheresis (Dextran sulphate) Familial Hypercholesterolemia Hyper Lp(a) lipoproteinemia     X Lipoprotein Apheresis (Dextran sulphate)   Preeclampsia   X     Lipoprotein Apheresis (H.

Different clinical use of conventional and selective apheresis techniques in relation to the pathology to be treated in emergency or on long (chronic) -term.  Throughout the acute phase of hyperlipidemic pancreatitis (HLP), PEX (Lipid-apheresis) could be of considerable assistance not only in lowering TG levels but also in the prevention of recurrent HLP (3). Furthermore, patients with homo-, double- compound-, and heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia and HyperLp(a) lipoproteinemia would benefit lipoprotein-apheresis (LA) as an extracorporeal procedure providing selective removal of lipids and lipoproteins including Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL) and other apolipoprotein B 100 -containing lipoproteins (4, 5). Having numerous metabolic and <b>clinical</b> <b>superiorities,</b> LA characterizes an upgraded selective form of conventional extracorporeal therapies, e. g. plasma-exchange (PEX- Lipid-apheresis), which were broadly-used for managing severe hypercholesterolemia in the seventies. However, LA is primarily used in the treatment of previously-mentioned severe forms of dyslipidemia. FH patients are particularly prone to coronary ischemic events necessitating a tailored, intensive, efficient, continuous, and unceasing form of treatment. Obviously, a therapeutic approach exclusively relying on existing accessible medications would not lead to preferred clinical outcomes. The above reported clinical examples clearly suggest what differences exist between the non-selective and selective apheresis techniques as far as different pathologies exhibiting affinity are concerned. In particular, the clinical presentation, emergency or not, greatly affects the use of a given extracorporeal technique. However, depending upon the indication, a selective technique not usually utilized in emergency, such as selective dextran sulfate cellulose LA was recently suggested to treat acutely preeclampsia, where targeted therapies to stabilize the clinical manifestations and prolong pregnancy do not exist (6). A further complication of the apheresis issue is represented by the indication of sepsis with multi organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) as {{the most common cause of}} death in patients in non-coronary intensive care units. Presently, an effective treatment to reduce mortality in sepsis and MODS patients is still not available. Therapeutic PEX in the management of sepsis and MODS was suggested several years ago and more recently (7, 8). On the other side, even a selective LA technique such as Heparin induced Extracorporeal Lipoprotein Precipitation (H. E. L. P.) was used in the treatment of sepsis and it is still on use (9). In conclusion, extracorporeal therapeutic techniques can be clinically helpful in emergency, in deferred urgency and in chronic, long-term use. As these techniques are invasive and relatively complex, appropriate equipment and highly skillful medical and non-medical staff personnel is a necessary complement.   Key words: Therapeutic Plasmapheresis, Plasma Exchange, Lipoprotein Apheresis, Hyperlipidemic Pancreatitis, Acute Pancreatitis, Homozygous- Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia, Hyper Lp(a) lipoproteinemi...|$|R

There is some evidence that lithium treatment might be effective in reducing the risk of completed suicide in adult patients with unipolar affective disorders, however no clear cut results have been found so far. The primary aim of the present study is to assess whether adding lithium to standard therapy is an effective treatment strategy {{to reduce the risk of}} suicidal behaviour in long term treatment of people with TRD and previous history of DSH. METHODS/DESIGN: We will carry out a randomised, parallel group, assessor-blinded <b>superiority</b> <b>clinical</b> trial. Adults with a diagnosis of major depression, an episode of DSH in the previous 12 months and inadequate response to at least two antidepressants given sequentially at an adequate dose for an adequate time for the current depressive episode will be allocated to add lithium to current therapy (intervention arm) or not (control arm). Following randomisation, treatment is to be taken daily for 1 year unless some clear reason to stop develops. Suicide completion and acts of DSH during the 12 months of follow-up will constitute the composite primary outcome. To preserve outcome assessor blindness, an independent adjudicating committee, blind to treatment allocation, will anonymously review all outcome events. DISCUSSION: The results of this study should indicate whether lithium treatment is associated with lower risk of completed suicide and DSH in adult patients with treatment resistant unipolar depression, who recently attempted suicide.

40|$|Aims: Compared {{with bare}} metal stents (BMS), early {{generation}} drug-eluting stents (DES) {{reduce the risk}} of revascularisation in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) at the expense of an increased risk of very late stent thrombosis (ST). Durable polymer coatings for controlled drug release have been identified as a potential trigger for these late adverse events and this has {{led to the development of}} newer generation DES with durable and biodegradable polymer surface coatings with improved biocompatibility. In a recent all-comers trial, biolimus-eluting stents with a biodegradable polymer surface coating were found to {{reduce the risk of}} very late ST by 80 % compared with sirolimus-eluting stents with durable polymer, which also translated into a lower risk of cardiac death and myocardial infarction (MI) beyond one year. Methods and results: The multicentre COMFORTABLE AMI trial (NCT 00962416) randomly assigned 1, 161 patients to treatment with biolimus-eluting stents with biodegrable polymer and bare metal stents of otherwise identical design at 11 international sites. The primary endpoint is a composite of cardiac death, target-vessel MI and target lesion revascularisation at one year. Assuming a relative risk reduction of 40 % in event rates of the primary endpoint in favour of biolimus-eluting stents with biodegradable polymer, 1, 064 patients will provide 80 % power to demonstrate <b>superiority.</b> <b>Clinical</b> follow-up will be continued through five years. Conclusions: The COMFORTABLE AMI trial will determine whether biolimus-eluting stents with biodegradable polymer are superior to bare metal stents of otherwise identical design. This is the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating DES with a biodegradable polymer surface coating for drug release in the treatment of patients with STEM...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundPorous hydroxyapatite/collagen {{composite}} (HAp/Col) is a bioresorbable {{bone substitute}} composed of nano-scale HAp and porcine type 1 collagen. In this study, the efficacy and safety were assessed {{in comparison to}} commercially available porous β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP). MethodsPatients with bone defects caused by benign bone tumors, fractures, or harvesting of autografts were randomly allocated for implantation of porous HAp/Col (n =  63) or porous β-TCP (n =  63). X-ray images were scored and {{used to evaluate the}} efficacy of the implantation until 24 weeks after surgery. Blood tests and observation of the surgical site were also performed to evaluate the safety of the implants. In total, 59 and 60 cases were analyzed in the porous HAp/Col and β-TCP groups, respectively. ResultsAt 18 and 24 weeks after surgery, the highest grade of bone regeneration was more frequent in the porous HAp/Col group than in the porous β-TCP group (p =  0. 0004 and 0. 0254 respectively). Wilcoxon's rank sum test confirmed the superiority of porous HAp/Col from early time points onward (p =  0. 0084, 4 w; p =  0. 0037, 8 w; p =  0. 0030, 12 w; p <  0. 0001, 18 w; and p =  0. 0316, 24 w). The incidence of adverse effects was higher in the porous HAp/Col group than in the β-TCP group. However, no serious adverse events were reported and no cases needed {{to drop out of the}} <b>clinical</b> trial. ConclusionsThe <b>superiority</b> of porous HAp/Col for bone regeneration in comparison to an established porous β-TCP was confirmed. Although the incidence of side effects associated with the porous HAp/Col implant was higher than that in the β-TCP group, no serious adverse events occurred that resulted in rejection of the implants...|$|R
