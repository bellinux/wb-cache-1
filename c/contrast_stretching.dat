40|$|Various {{applications}} {{require an}} optimized (and rapid) display of remote sensing imagery. Multisensor and multiband remote sensing data {{have to be}} enhanced for optimal band combination and image contrast. Problems that exist are that <b>contrast</b> <b>stretches</b> are usually optimized for the whole image and might not prove appropriate for selected features. For example, an image that contains land, water and beach classes will be stretched {{in a way that}} would produce a compromise for the different classes. Water is usually dark (especially in CIR display), beach will be very bright with little discernible structure (similar for urban classes), and other land classes (e. g. vegetation) will not make use of the full possible range of digital numbers. Also, different features might require different band combinations for optimum display. Selected stretching especially for regions of low contrast is nothing new in the analysis of remotely sensed data. Usually, this is done interactively by the analyst either by selecting a box or digitizing a certain area of interest in the image. This area is then enhanced using standard image processing techniques. The subset is then displayed separately to highlight certain features that would have been impossible to discern in a global enhancement mode. The goal of this study was to develop automated procedures for feature based image enhancement techniques. Feature based enhancement means that different feature classes in the image require different procedures for optimum display. The procedures do not only encompass locally varying enhancement techniques such as histogram equalization or <b>contrast</b> <b>stretch</b> but also the selection of different spectral bands. There are two main sources for this kind of information: (a) storage of a priori knowledge in a GIS, and (b) context based image information that can be extracted through a segmentation process.

30|$|Iqbal et al. {{proposed}} the integrated color model (ICM) (Iqbal et al. 2007) and the unsupervised color correction method (UCM) (Iqbal et al. 2010). In Iqbal et al. (2007), the output {{image in the}} red-green-blue (RGB) color model is stretched over the entire dynamic range. The image is then converted to the hue-saturation-intensity (HSI) color model. In this color model, the S and I components are applied with <b>contrast</b> <b>stretching.</b> After stretching, the image in HSI color model is then converted back into the RGB color model to produce an enhanced output image. In (Iqbal et al. 2010), Iqbal et al. modified two color channels, red and green, based on the Von Kries hypothesis to reduce the color cast. Contrast correction is then applied in the RGB color model. The image histograms are stretched at one or both sides based on the minimum and maximum values of each channel taken at 0.2 % and 99.8 % at the minimum and maximum points of the original histogram, respectively. <b>Contrast</b> <b>stretching</b> toward the upper side is applied to red, which is the lowest intensity channel. <b>Contrast</b> <b>stretching</b> at both sides is applied to green, which is the middle intensity value of the color channels, and <b>contrast</b> <b>stretching</b> at the lower side is applied to blue, which is the dominant color cast (Iqbal et al. 2010). For underwater images, the image is further converted into the HSI color model, and the S and I components are stretched at both the lower and upper sides. The overall contrast performances of the output images for both techniques increase. Nevertheless, not much difference {{can be observed in}} the output images using both techniques.

40|$|Success of scale-invariant feature {{transform}} (SIFT) {{image registration}} is limited when attempted on camera footage taken under water. This is, {{largely due to}} the poor image quality inherent to imaging in aquatic environments. In this research we aim to overcome this shortcoming using a new method of pre-processing of true-color imagery taken under water based on the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram image Equalization (CLAHE) algorithm. CLAHE assumes that the distribution function of the pixel intensity values of an underwater-recorded image is dominated by Rayleigh scattering, and that the noise can be removed as a function hereof. Results showed that after applying the CLAHE image enhancement method registration success of SIFT increased by 41 % compared to reference method (a straightforward <b>contrast</b> <b>stretching</b> enhancement). From the ANOVA results follows that the null hypothesis can be rejected and concluded that there is a significant difference among SIFT without enhancement, SIFT with <b>contrast</b> <b>stretching</b> and SIFT with CLAHE-Rayleigh at 5 % level of significance (ANOVA, F= 23. 41, df= 2, p-value= 7. 34 e- 09).
