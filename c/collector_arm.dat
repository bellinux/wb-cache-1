40|$|The {{detailed}} {{characterization of}} a rotating <b>arm</b> <b>collector</b> to sample ambient fog droplets for chemical analysis is presented. Because {{of the large}} volume of sample required, and because fog droplets are of supermicron size and are sensitive to local thermodynamic disturbances, conventional methods for atmospheric aerosol sampling are not suitable for fogwater sampling. Design criteria for fogwater samplers are outlined. Devices used in previous investigations are evaluated {{in light of these}} criteria. The design of a rotating <b>arm</b> <b>collector</b> is discussed, and it is shown that this instrument performs adequately in preserving the physical and chemical integrity of the sample at all stages of collection.

40|$|A {{side-by-side}} {{comparison of}} the Rotating <b>Arm</b> <b>Collector</b> (RAC) and the Caltech Active Strand Cloudwater Collector (CASCC) was conducted at an elevated coastal site near {{the eastern end of}} the Santa Barbara Channel in southern California. The CASCC was observed to collect cloudwater at rates of up to 8. 5 ml min^(− 1). The ratio of cloudwater collection rates was found to be close to the theoretical prediction of 4. 2 : 1 (CASCC:RAC) over a wide range of liquid water contents (LWC). At low LWC, however, this ratio climbed rapidly, possibly reflecting a predominance of small droplets under these conditions, coupled with a greater collection efficiency of small droplets by the CASCC. Cloudwater samples collected by the RAC had significantly higher concentrations of Na^+, Ca^(2 +), Mg^(2 +) and Cl^− than those collected by the CASCC. These higher concentrations may be due to differences in the chemical composition of large vs small droplets. No significant differences were observed in concentrations of NO_ 3 ^−, SO_ 4 ^(2 −) or NH_ 4 ^+ in samples collected by the two instruments...|$|R
40|$|We {{measured}} {{the concentrations of}} Cl^−, NO_ 3 ^−, and SO_ 4 ^(2 −) in atmospheric cloudwater collected with a passive collector from a remote marine site and the concentrations of Cl^−, NO_ 3 ^−, SO_ 4 ^(2 −), Na^+ and NH_ 4 ^+ in cloudwater from a continental site. At the continental site, an active rotating <b>arm</b> <b>collector</b> was employed for cloudwater collection. At both locations, we observed an inverse relationship between the measured ion concentrations and the liquid water content of the clouds. The product of the observed concentrations and the liquid water content, the cloudwater loading, {{was found to be}} nearly constant. A study of published cloudwater data showed that at the majority of the examined locations this product varied little at any given site, whereas large differences exist between sites. The finding of the small variation in cloudwater loadings could be explained by the hypothesis that nucleation scavenging is the dominant process in the acquisition of solutes into hydro-meteors during fog and cloud formation...|$|R

40|$|Targeted Muscle Reinnervation is a {{relatively}} new surgical procedure that endeavors to make control of upper-limb prostheses more intuitive for amputees. This procedure reroutes residual nerve bundles from an amputated limb to muscles in the chest or proximal to the site of amputation in the arm, producing EMGs in response to motor commands. These EMGs are traditionally collected using surface electrodes. Research is ongoing to design an implantable electrode that can read these EMG signals directly from the muscle, which would increase the integrity of the retrieved signal by creating more permanent, stable connections between the muscles and the signal <b>collectors.</b> A robotic <b>arm</b> testing system was developed in order to test the efficacy of these implantable electrodes and demonstrate a complete system from EMG signal retrieval to motion triggering in an upper-limb prosthetic. This robotic arm offers up to six degrees of freedom intended to closely replicate the capabilities of a biological arm. The objectives and scope of the robotic arm project as well as its design and abilities is the focus of this work. In addition, its implications for designing low-cost prostheses for the Third World will be explored and discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|In spring 1985, field {{experiments}} were started {{to study the}} scavenging processes of atmospheric substances. Besides the chemical analysis of precipitation samples, these studies required simultaneous collection of cloud water for chemical analysis. In particular, a ground-based cloud water collector was needed, suitable for use {{on the top of}} a TV-tower. Existing designs of ground-based cloud or fogwater samplers be divided into two general classes: a) passive collectors, which utilize the ambient wind to impact the droplets on the collection surface; b) active collectors, which accelerate the droplets to a certain velocity as they approach the collection surface. A well-known passive collector is the one described by Falconer and Falconer. Teflon-strings are extended between two disks which are 1 m apart. The disadvantage of this collector, for our experiments, was that the collector strings are always exposed to the ambient air, so that contamination by aerosol impact during dry period s cannot be excluded. Furthermore, because of the length of the strings, impacted droplets need a certain time to drain off, during which they remain exposed to the ambient air stream and continue to scavenge trace gases. Active collectors, such as the rotating <b>arm</b> <b>collector</b> described by Jacob et al., or jet impactors were not suitable for the use on top of the TV-tower because of safety or power requirements.

40|$|The {{chemical}} composition of ambient fogwater was studied at several {{urban and rural}} sites in California and at a site in Albany, NY, using a rotating <b>arm</b> <b>collector</b> (accompanying paper by Jacob et al.). The ionic concentrations observed were generally much higher than those commonly found in precipitation. In the Los Angeles basin and the San Joaquin Valley of California extremely high acidities were found. Fog sampled in rural areas frequently had high ionic concentrations, indicating long-range pollutant transport. Low stratus clouds in the Los Angeles basin {{were found to be}} chemically similar to ground-level fogs. At some California sites the aerosol and gas-phase chemistry were monitored prior to fog formation and after fog evaporation. From these measurements it appears that fog droplets are efficient scavengers of ambient aerosol particles and gases. At Albany data was available on the liquid water content, droplet microphysics and boundary layer meteorological parameters; it is found that condensation and evaporation of water vapor on preexisting nuclei are the dominant processes controlling the {{chemical composition}} of fog droplets. Absorption of SO_ 2 followed by aqueous-phase oxidation to sulfate, with the concomitant production f acidity, is also expected to contribute to observed concentrations. Aqueous-phase oxidation of S(IV) by oxygen could in some cases be important in view of the high concentrations of transition metal catalysts found in the fogwater...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a summary of}} our {{findings}} from a four-year study of the chemical composition of fog and cloud water in California. Fog water was sampled {{at a number of}} sites with a rotating <b>arm</b> <b>collector,</b> which was developed in our laboratory and collects representative samples. Field investigations in the Los Angeles basin, the San Gabriel Mountains, and the San Joaquin Valley revealed very high ionic concentrations in polluted fogs, often coupled with very high acidities. Fogs and stratus clouds in the Los Angeles basin typically had pH values ranging from 2 to 4. Acidities were not as high in the San Joaquin Valley, mostly because of scavenging by the fogs of ammonia from agricultural sources. We showed that fogwater deposits efficiently on surfaces during fog events; this deposition was observed to be an important pollutant sink during stagnation episodes in the San Joaquin Valley, {{but at the same time}} it could be an important source of acid input to surfaces in some areas. Insight into the oxidation of S(IV) to S(VI), which is the major aqueous-phase source of acidity, was gained from field data, laboratory studies, and model development. Kinetic experiments showed that H_ 2 O_ 2 was an important oxidant at low pH, and we predicted that metal-catalyzed autoxidation could also be an important source of sulfate. However, we found that the extreme acidities observed in fogs (below pH 3) require condensation on preexistent acidic nuclei and scavenging of gaseous nitric acid. Stabilization of S(IV) in the fog was observed, and this was attributed to the formation of S(IV) -aldehyde adduct...|$|R
