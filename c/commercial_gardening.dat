40|$|Developing {{appropriate}} and innovative technologies and policies {{to respond to}} the challenges that urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) faces in West Africa requires {{a better understanding of the}} existing production systems. Although there is an increasing recognition of the importance of UPA in the region, its extent, forms and related practices may vary across countries and cities because of different socio-economic conditions and urbanization patterns. A systematic classification of the regional UPA systems is lacking but is necessary to allow for meaningful comparisons between cities and avoid misleading generalizations. The purpose of this study was to develop a typology of UPA households across three selected West African cities. Survey data from 318 UPA households (Kano: 99, Bobo Dioulasso: 111, Sikasso: 108) were submitted to principal components analysis for categorical variables (CATPCA). Next, the Two-Step cluster method was used to classify the households using object scores obtained from the CATPCA. Diversification of farm activities, farm resource endowment and production orientation were the major discriminating variables. In each city, four distinct UPA systems were identified, of which three were common to Kano, Bobo Dioulasso and Sikasso: <b>commercial</b> <b>gardening</b> plus field crops and livestock (59 %, 18 %, and 37 %), commercial livestock plus subsistence field cropping (14 %, 41 %, and 7 %), and <b>commercial</b> <b>gardening</b> plus semi-commercial field cropping (14 %, 28 %, and 30 %).

The present study is aimed at a refined characterization of the diversity in terms of production orientation, resource endowments and production strategies of {{the different types of}} farm households involved in urban and peri-urban agriculture in three West African cities. A total of 318 UPA households were surveyed using a standardized semi-structured questionnaire in the West African cities Kano (Nigeria), Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) and Sikasso (Mali). Through categorical principal component analysis and two-step cluster analysis, six distinct household clusters were identified based on resource endowments and the degree of integration of vegetable, field crop and animal production. Three clusters appeared in all three cities; the remaining three were specific for one of the cities each and comprised (i) <b>commercial</b> <b>gardening</b> plus field crop-livestock (cGCL) keeping, (ii) commercial livestock plus subsistence field cropping (cLsC), (iii) <b>commercial</b> <b>gardening</b> plus semi-commercial field cropping (cGscC), (iv) <b>commercial</b> <b>gardening</b> plus semi-commercial livestock (cGscL) keeping, (v) commercial field cropping (cC) and (vi) <b>commercial</b> <b>gardening</b> (cG). Production constraints were similar across the cities, that is, high costs of inputs, water shortages and lack of fertilizers in the garden and field crop production systems, while feeding constraints and animal diseases were the main constraints in livestock production.

Urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) {{is defined}} as the cultivation of crops and keeping livestock within and around cities. In addition to providing the cities’ demand of fresh vegetables, crops and livestock products, it {{plays an important role in}} the livelihoods of the urban farmers. With the rapid urbanization in sub-Saharan Africa, UPA provides food and jobs for many urban dwellers. UPA makes use of a diverse range of urban resources such as labour, waste and wastewater to produce food and raise livestock, and it is characterized by large nutrient imports into farms or gardens, often accompanied by environmental and human health risks. In view of the complexity and diversity of the UPA systems, there is a need to understand the socio-economic characteristics of UPA as drivers to farm management practices. This research was conducted in three secondary West African cities with important UPA activities: Kano (Nigeria), Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) and Sikasso (Mali). From principal component analysis of categorical variables (CATPCA) and two-step cluster analysis, six major farm types were identified based on production systems and market orientation, of which three are common in the three cities and one farm type is unique to each city. The six farm types are <b>commercial</b> <b>gardening</b> plus field crop-livestock (cGCL); <b>commercial</b> <b>gardening</b> plus semi-commercial cropping (cGscC); commercial livestock plus subsistence field cropping (cLsC); <b>commercial</b> <b>gardening</b> plus semi-commercial livestock (cGscL); commercial cropping (cC); and <b>commercial</b> <b>gardening</b> (cG). The former three are common for the three cities, the latter three farm types are unique for one city, each. The diverse activities in these farm types contributed differently to household income. Nutrient balance studies are useful indicators to assess the sustainability of farming systems. From the identified farm types, in-depth assessment of nutrient flows and balances as well as the economic performance of the different production systems was conducted in Kano (Nigeria) using the nutrient monitoring toolbox (NUTMON/MONQI). Farm nitrogen (N) balance was positive at 56. 6, 67. 4 and 56. 4 kg farm − 1 yr − 1 for cGCL, cGscL and cLsC farm types, respectively. The same trend was observed for phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in all the farm types except for cGCL where an annual negative K balance of 16 kg farm − 1 was found. Commercially-oriented livestock keeping (cLsC) was economically more viable than the other farm types with average annual positive gross margin (GM) and net cash flow (NCF) of 033 and 35, respectively. Cropping activities within cGCL and cGscL had positive GMs (059 and 94) and NCFs (57 and 06), but livestock activities in both farm types incurred financial losses. Using the same MONQI approach across vegetable production systems of the three cities, large amounts of nutrients were observed to be applied with large positive nutrient balances. Average annual N balances were positive for all gardens in the three cities: 279, 1127 and 74 kg N ha – 1 in Kano, Bobo Dioulassoand Sikasso, respectively. Phosphorus balance was positive in all cities except annual K deficits of 222 and 187 kg ha – 1 in Kano and Sikasso, respectively. Efficiencies were 63 %, 51 % and 87 % for N; with poor P use efficiencies due to excess application in all three cities. K efficiency of 85 % was observed in Bobo Dioulassowhile in Kano and Sikasso’s gardens, it was 120 % and 110 % respectively, indicating K mining. The average annual gross margins/benefits from gardening indicate a higher return of. 83 m – 2 in Bobo Dioulasso and differs statistically (P< 0. 05) from returns obtained in Kano (conv 2. info. 92 m – 2) and Sikasso (. 37 m – 2). Results show that UPA is an important economic livelihood strategy for urban and peri-urban farmers because of positive economic returns but with huge environmental trade-offs as a consequence of excess nutrient application. Efforts to better integrate resource management with measures to improve environmental and food safety are required of UPA stakeholders. Achieving this will require the formal recognition of the UPA sector by city officials, along with formulating realistic strategies for effective nutrient and water management for a more sustainable UPA operation in West Africa. The consistent and replicable typology developed in this study provides a basis to target system-specific technologies and appropriate recommendations to improve use efficiencies of resources as a whole.    ...|$|E
40|$|Urban {{agriculture}} increasingly supplies {{food and}} non-food {{services to the}} rapidly growing West African cities. However, with its typically heavy use of fertilizers and uncontrolled use of water, it bears severe risks of soil and groundwater pollution. This study {{was carried out in}} Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso, West Africa) at two <b>commercial</b> <b>gardening</b> sites. It aimed at performing a detailed characterization of farmer’s water and nutrient management strategies. Four vegetable crops were monitored (tomato, cabbage, carrot and lettuce). Water inputs (rainfall and irrigation), nutrient inputs (organic and mineral fertilizers and nutrients in irrigation water) and crop uptake were monitored over a 1 – 2 -year period. In addition, pan lysimeters allowed monitoring drainage. Depending on the site, 3 – 8 % of the input water was lost by drainage, i. e., as much as 293 mm/year at one of the sites. During the dry season, when the farmer has full control over the water supply, water application exceeded plant requirements by as much as 40 %, which reveals inefficient water use. Up to 800 kg N ha- 1, 140 kg P ha- 1 and 500 kg K ha- 1 were applied for a single crop cycle. With few exceptions, crops tended to be strongly over-fertilized, except for K at one of the two sites. Nutrient supply exceeded crop requirements by 109 to 2, 012 kg N, 66 to 450 kg P and 0 to 393 kg K per year. These results, in combination with the large observed rates of drainage, are indicative of a high risk of nutrient leaching and groundwater contamination. The partial factor productivity of nutrients tended to be low. These results therefore suggested that there is scope to substantially reduce nutrient application rates in these systems without adverse effects on yields, which would be beneficial for groundwater resources and improve the economic returns...|$|E

40|$|Nutrient {{balances}} {{are useful}} indicators {{to assess the}} sustainability of farming systems. This study study investigates inflow and outflow of major nutrients in urban and periurban production systems in Kano, Nigeria. To this end, 16 households representing three different urban and peri-urban (UPA) farming systems were studied using the MONQI toolbox (formerly known as NUTMON) to calculate nutrient flows and economic performances. The farm nitrogen (N) balance was positive at 56. 6, 67. 4 and 56. 4 kg farm- 1 year- 1 for commercial garden and crop-livestock (cGCL), <b>commercial</b> <b>gardening</b> and semi-commercial livestock (cGscL) and commercial livestock subsistence field cropping (cLsC) farm types, respectively. The same trend was observed for phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in all farm types except an annual negative K balance of 16 kg farm- 1 in cGCL. Across the different activities within the farms, land uses had positive N (359, 387 and 563 kg N ha- 1 year- 1) and P (74, 219 and 411 kg P ha- 1 year- 1) balances for all farm types, but again a negative K balance in cGCL with an average loss of 533 kg K ha- 1 year- 1. Partial nutrient balances in livestock production indicated a positive balance for all nutrients across the farms types but were slightly negative for P in cLsC. Commercial livestock keeping (cLsC) was economically more profitable than the other farm types with an average annual gross margin (GM) and net cash flow (NCF) of 9, 033 and 935. Cropping activities within cGCL and cGscL had GMs of 1, 059 and 194 and NCFs of 757 and 206, respectively, but livestock activities in both farm types incurred financial losses. Potassium inputs were limited under vegetable and crop production of cGCL, threatening long-term K nutrient availability in this system. Overall, the results indicated large annual surpluses of N and P in urban and peri-urban vegetable and crop production systems which pose a potential threat when lost to the environment.

40|$|The {{regional}} {{population growth}} in West Africa, and especially its urban centers, will bring about new and critical challenges for urban development policy, {{especially in terms of}} ensuring food security and providing employment for the growing population. (Peri-) urban livestock and vegetable production systems, which can contribute significantly to these endeavours, are limited by various constraints, amongst them limited access to expensive production factors and their (in) efficient use. To achieve sustainable production systems with low consumer health risks, that can meet the urban increased demand, this doctoral thesis determined nutrient use efficiencies in representative (peri-) urban livestock production systems in three West African cities, and investigated potential health risks for consumers ensuing from there. The field study, which was conducted during July 2007 to December 2009, undertook a comparative analysis of (peri-) urban livestock production strategies across 210 livestock keeping households (HH) in the three West African cities of Kano/Nigeria (84 HH), Bobo Dioulasso/Burkina Faso (63 HH) and Sikasso/Mali (63 HH). These livestock enterprises were belonging to the following three farm types: <b>commercial</b> <b>gardening</b> plus field crops and livestock (cGCL; 88 HH), commercial livestock plus subsistence field cropping (cLsC; 109 HH) and <b>commercial</b> <b>gardening</b> plus semi-commercial livestock (cGscL; 13 HH) which had been classified in a preceding study; they represented the diversity of (peri-) urban livestock production systems in West Africa. In the study on the efficiency of ruminant livestock production, lactating cowsand sheep herd units were differentiated based on whether feed supplements were offered to the animals at the homestead (Go: grazing only; Gsf: mainly grazing plus some supplement feeding). Inflows and outflows of nutrients were quantified in these herds during 18 months, and the effects of seasonal variations in nutrient availability on animals’ productivity and reproductive performance was determined in Sikasso. To assess the safety of animal products and vegetables, contamination sources of irrigated lettuce and milk with microbiological contaminants, and of tomato and cabbage with pesticide residues in (peri-) urban agriculture systems of Bobo Dioulasso and Sikasso were characterized at three occasions in 2009. Samples of irrigation water, organic fertilizer and ix lettuce were collected in 6 gardens, and samples of cabbage and tomato in 12 gardens; raw and curdled milk were sampled in 6 dairy herds. Information on health risks for consumers of such foodstuffs was obtained from 11 health centers in Sikasso. In (peri-) urban livestock production systems, sheep and goats dominated (P 0. 05), but the proportion of HH heads with a long-term experience in (peri-) urban agriculture was higher in Kano and in Bobo Dioulasso than in Sikasso (P< 0. 001). Cattle and sheep fetched highest market prices in Kano; unit prices for goats and chicken were highest in Sikasso. Animal inflow, outflow and dairy herd growth rates were significantly higher (P< 0. 05) in the Gsf than in the Go cattle herds. Maize bran and cottonseed expeller were the main feeds offered to Gsf cows as dry-season supplement, while Gsf sheep received maize bran, fresh grasses and cowpea pods. The short periodic transhumance of Go dairy cows help them maintaining their live weight, whereas Gsf cows lost weight during the dry season despite supplement feeding at a rate of 1506 g dry matter per cow and day, resulting in low productivity and reproductive performance. The daily live weight gains of calves and lambs, respectively, were low and not significantly different between the Go and the Gsf system. However, the average live weight gains of lambs were significantly higher in the dry season (P< 0. 05) than in the rainy season because of the high pressure of gastrointestinal parasites and of Trypanosoma sp. In consequence, 47 % of the sheep leaving the Go and Gsf herds died due to diseases during the study period. Thermo-tolerant coliforms and Escherichia coli contamination levels of irrigation water significantly exceeded WHO recommendations for the unrestricted irrigation of vegetables consumed raw. Microbial contamination levels of lettuce at the farm gate and the market place in Bobo Dioulasso and at the farm gate in Sikasso were higher than at the market place in Sikasso (P< 0. 05). Pesticide residues were detected in only one cabbage and one tomato sample and were below the maximum residue limit for consumption. Counts of thermo-tolerant coliforms and Escherichia coli were higher in curdled than in raw milk (P< 0. 05). From 2006 to x 2009, cases of diarrhea/vomiting and typhoid fever had increased by 11 % and 48 %, respectively, in Sikasso. For ensuring economically successful and ecologically viable (peri-) urban livestock husbandry and food safety of (peri-) urban foodstuffs of animal and plant origin, the dissemination and adoption of improved feeding practices, livestock healthcare and dung management are key. In addition, measures fostering the safety of animal products and vegetables including the appropriate use of wastewater in (peri-) urban agriculture, restriction to approve vegetable pesticides and the respect of their latency periods, and passing and enforcement of safety laws is required. Finally, the incorporation of environmentally sound (peri-) urban agriculture in urban planning by policy makers, public and private extension agencies and the urban farmers themselves is of utmost importance. To enable an efficient (peri-) urban livestock production in the future, research should concentrate on cost-effective feeding systems that allow meeting the animals’ requirement for production and reproduction. Thereby focus should be laid on the use of crop-residues and leguminous forages. The improvement of the milk production potential through crossbreeding of local cattle breeds with exotic breeds known for their high milk yield might be an accompanying option, but it needs careful supervision to prevent the loss of the local trypanotolerant purebreds.
