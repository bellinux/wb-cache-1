5|$|In July 2011, Parachutes <b>climbed</b> <b>from</b> No. 184 back to No. 48 in {{the album}}'s 318th {{charting}} week there. As of February 2012, the album had sold 2,559,678 copies in the UK, {{making it the}} third biggest selling Coldplay album behind A Rush of Blood to the Head (2.8 million) and X (2.6 million).|$|E
5|$|The film's budget <b>climbed</b> <b>from</b> {{an initial}} US$150 {{million to a}} then-record-breaking $207 million, making it {{at one point the}} most {{expensive}} film yet made. Universal only agreed to such an outlay after seeing a screening of the unfinished film, to which executives responded enthusiastically. Marketing and promotion costs were an estimated $60 million. The film's length also grew; originally set to be 135 minutes, it soon grew to 200, prompting Universal executives to fly to New Zealand to view a rough cut, but they liked it so their concerns were addressed.|$|E
5|$|A {{considerable}} leap {{in quality}} is evident here, {{compared to the}} Apostles {{of the church of}} Santa Maria dei Miracoli that had been carved just a few years earlier. The cycle of the Caesars is not only considerably grander in size but also a notable qualitative improvement over the previous production. The presence of these Caesars on the façade of the Loggia in Brescia is testament of an architectural and figurative leap, a full expression of classical art that has <b>climbed</b> <b>from</b> the earlier experiments at the Miracoli. Cairano, through the creation of the cycle and subsequent architectural ornamentation of the Loggia palazzo, becomes the fulcrum of commissions, both public and private, from Brescians keen to show off their descent from ancient Rome and to ride the wave of the local Renaissance.|$|E
50|$|The climb can be {{accessed}} by three roads, with the approach from Mele the most common. Though the <b>climb</b> <b>from</b> this road features some gradients topping 10%, these stretches are very brief and the average gradient is only 4%.

5|$|Difficult {{economic}} times marked Brown's term in office. During his tenure, the state's unemployment rate <b>climbed</b> <b>from</b> 5.6 percent to 11.7 percent. Brown {{stuck to his}} campaign promise not to raise taxes. When state income fell short of expectations, he reduced the state budget by 22 percent and {{cut the number of}} state employees from 37,241 to 30,783, mostly through transfer and attrition. At the same time, his merit pay policies increased salaries for the remaining employees by an average of 34 percent. He cut the executive office staff from ninety-seven to thirty, and sold seven of the state's eight government airplanes.|$|E
5|$|FIAT driver Aldo Weilschott <b>climbed</b> <b>from</b> fourteenth on lap {{three to}} third on lap five, before his car {{rolled off the}} planks outside Vibraye. Szisz {{maintained}} the lead he had gained on lap three to finish the first day just before noon {{in a time of}} 5hours, 45minutes and 30.4seconds (5:45:30.4), 26minutes ahead of Albert Clément of Clément-Bayard. Despite a slow start, FIAT driver Felice Nazzaro moved up to third position, 15minutes behind Clément. Seventeen cars completed the first day; Henri Rougier's Lorraine-Dietrich finished last with a time of 8:15:55.0, two-and-a-half-hours behind Szisz. All the cars that were competing the next day were moved into parc fermé, a floodlit area guarded overnight by members of the ACF, to prevent teams and drivers from working on them until the following morning.|$|E
5|$|Grissom {{asked to}} remain in Korea to fly another 25 flights, but his request was denied. He was given the option of {{choosing}} which base he wished to be stationed at in the United States; he requested Bryan AFB in Bryan, Texas. He served there as a flight instructor, and was joined by his wife and son. His second child was born there in 1953. During a training exercise with a cadet, a trainee pilot caused a flap to break off the plane, sending it spinning out of control. Grissom <b>climbed</b> <b>from</b> the rear seat of the small craft {{to take over the}} controls and safely land the jet.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{took his}} fifth win {{of the season}} when he crossed {{the line at the}} end of the 56th lap, almost 15seconds ahead of the second-placed Massa. Räikkönen took third ahead of Alonso. Heidfeld managed to jump from ninth on the grid to finish in fifth place, just ahead of his {{teammate}} Kubica, who <b>climbed</b> <b>from</b> eleventh on the grid. A one-stop pit strategy worked well for Glock as he finished seventh; Piquet took eighth. Vettel, Coulthard, Barrichello and Nakajima took the next four places; Bourdais recovered from his early contact with Trulli to take 13th. Webber's initial success with a two-stop strategy faded as he finished 14th. Rosberg took 15th, ahead of Button and Fisichella. Trulli, Sutil and Kovalainen were the three retirements from the 56lap race.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the album}} debuted at number ten on the UK Albums Chart {{with sales of}} 10,469 copies, making it Gaga's fifth top ten album and Bennett's third.

Due to Bennett and Gaga's {{appearance}} on Strictly Come Dancing and Gaga's ArtRave tour, the album rebounded to number 12 on the chart in its fifth week, selling 6,257 copies. In November 2015, the album was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for selling over 60,000 copies. In Ireland the album debuted outside the top-ten of the Irish Albums Chart, at number 12, dropping to number 24 the next week. In its fifth week, Cheek to Cheek again <b>climbed</b> <b>from</b> number 50 to number 24 on the chart.|$|E
5|$|Mount Washington is {{a common}} objective, and is often <b>climbed</b> <b>from</b> Pinkham Notch. There are {{numerous}} trail approaches from the Appalachian Mountain Club's visitor's center. Although trail distances seem short, {{the trip to the}} summit should not be underestimated; most trail approaches involve at least 4,000 vertical feet (1,200m) of climbing, including an ascent of the rocky summit cone and the boulder-strewn upper slopes. Weather changes very quickly, and one must be prepared for extreme conditions. The Tuckerman Ravine Trail is the most popular trail in the notch, ascending to the summit via the headwall of Tuckerman Ravine. The Huntington Ravine Trail is widely considered the most difficult trail in New Hampshire, making its way up the precipitous headwall of neighboring Huntington Ravine, where there are several rock climbing opportunities.|$|E

5|$|The Bourbon Spanish, meanwhile, were {{planning}} {{to carry out a}} surprise attack. Simón Susarte, a Spanish goatherd who had fled Gibraltar after its capture by Rooke a few months earlier, told Villadarias that there was a secret route by which {{the east side of the}} Rock of Gibraltar could be scaled. It required a climb of around , of which the upper section was near-vertical, but was passable with the use of rope and ladders via the Great Sand Dune. As the east side was considered virtually impregnable, only the west side was fortified; if the Rock could be <b>climbed</b> <b>from</b> the east, an attacker could evade the fortifications and descend directly into the town. The route was reconnoitred and found to be passable by a lightly armed force.|$|E
5|$|The {{north face}} of Ben Nevis is riven with buttresses, ridges, towers and pinnacles, and {{contains}} many classic scrambles and rock climbs. It is of major importance for British winter climbing, {{with many of}} its routes holding snow often until late April. It {{was one of the}} first places in Scotland to receive the attention of serious mountaineers, with a descent of Tower Ridge in 1892 the earliest documented climbing expedition on the Ben. (It was not <b>climbed</b> <b>from</b> bottom to top for another two years). The Scottish Mountaineering Club's Charles Inglis Clark hut was built below the north face in Coire Leis in 1929. Because of its remote location, it is said to be the only genuine alpine hut in Britain. It remains popular with climbers, especially in winter.|$|E
5|$|Watford {{started the}} 1982–83 season with four league wins {{from the opening}} five fixtures; {{in the space of}} seven years, the club had <b>climbed</b> <b>from</b> bottom place in the lowest {{division}} of The Football League to top position in the highest division. Watford were unable to maintain a title challenge, but eventually finished the season second behind Liverpool, which ensured UEFA Cup qualification for the following season. Luther Blissett finished the season as the First Division top scorer, before signing for Italian Serie A side Milan for £1million {{at the end of the}} season. An FA Cup Final appearance followed in the 1984 fixture, where they lost to Everton. After guiding Watford to a ninth-place finish in 1986–87, Taylor left the club to manage Aston Villa.|$|E

5|$|As {{a part of}} the Pennsylvania system, the CL {{continued}} to operate its own property (which included the line north of Dodds after 1914) until January 1, 1921, when it was leased to the Pennsylvania. Starting at the end of 1918, the Interstate Commerce Commission classified the CL as a Class I railroad, meaning that it made at least $1 million per year in operating revenue. (This designation was dropped in 1921 when the CL was leased.) However, net operating income, revenue minus costs, which had steadily <b>climbed</b> <b>from</b> the 1890s, began falling in 1916, becoming a deficit in 1920. Subsequently, effective January 1, 1926, the Pennsylvania merged the CL with several other small companies—the Cleveland, Akron and Cincinnati Railway, Manufacturers Railway, Pennsylvania-Detroit Railroad, and Toledo, Columbus and Ohio River Railroadto create the Pennsylvania, Ohio and Detroit Railroad, a non-operating subsidiary. That company was merged into the Connecting Railway, previously a short link in Philadelphia, in 1956, and its lessee merged with the New York Central Railroad in 1968 to form Penn Central Transportation.|$|E
5|$|Filming for King Kong {{took place}} in New Zealand from September 2004 to March 2005. The project's budget <b>climbed</b> <b>from</b> an initial $150 million to a then-record-breaking $207 million. It was {{released}} on December 14, 2005 in Germany and on December 16 in the United States, and made an opening of $50.1 million. While it performed lower than expected, King Kong made domestic and worldwide grosses that eventually added up to $550 million, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film in Universal Pictures history at the time. It also generated $100 million in DVD sales upon its home video release. The film garnered positive reviews from critics and appeared on several top ten lists for 2005. It was praised for its special effects, performances, sense of spectacle and comparison to the 1933 original. It won three Academy Awards for Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Visual Effects.|$|E

As plug-in car sales slowed down during 2015, the segment's market share fell to 0.66% of new car sales, and increased to 0.90% in 2016. The highest-ever monthly market share for plug-in electric vehicles was achieved in December 2016 with 1.39% of new car sales. The previous record was set in September 2016 (1.12%) marking {{the first time the}} plug-in segment market share passed the 1% mark in the U.S. December 2016 is also the best monthly plug-in sales volume on record ever, with 23,288 units delivered.
