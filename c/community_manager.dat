5|$|Character {{selection}} was a collaborative process between Capcom and Marvel. According to Seth Killian, a former <b>community</b> <b>manager</b> for Capcom, Marvel presented {{a list of}} their own characters that {{they were interested in}} seeing in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Capcom then provided input regarding moveset possibilities in order to reach a consensus. Each company also had their own set of interests and priorities. Marvel characters, such as Rocket Raccoon and Nova, were chosen to cross-promote upcoming products. On the other hand, Capcom sought to bring more diversity into the cast. For example, Capcom wanted a monster-like character that could fight while in the air, leading to the inclusion of Firebrand.|$|E

While Zong Hui continued to develop the game based on his original design, Capcom took over tasks such as funding, marketing, and quality assurance. Capcom decided to distribute the game on PC instead of gaming consoles because Zong Hui did not have a license for console development. Svensson has noted that Capcom will consider console releases in the future, but chose to initially distribute the game on PC to keep the game free for fans and meet its December 17 target release date.|$|E

40|$|Globalization and {{technical}} change {{have had a}} significant impact on work in the cultural industries. Online games are services that are networked, operate around the clock and require ongoing player and company input. The industry's content production networks are dispersed internationally, and many of its services are offered transnationally. These new services have generated new forms of work, like community management, which are often outsourced to near-to-market locations. Much of the research on media work is focused on high status creative occupations or the free labour of amateurs. This paper draws upon the findings of a content analysis of job advertisements and face-to-face interviews with <b>community</b> <b>managers</b> to examine the recruitment and work of <b>community</b> <b>managers.</b> Using scholarship on media production, media work and emotional labour this article argues that recruitment and organizational practices surrounding <b>community</b> <b>managers</b> appropriate passion, <b>community,</b> and experience in the service of capital, but also marginalize these workers. While <b>community</b> <b>managers</b> see themselves as creative workers, their visibility and creative autonomy are limited by organizational and workplace cultures...|$|R

500|$|According {{to former}} Capcom USA <b>community</b> <b>manager</b> and {{fighting}} game advisor Seth Killian, {{one of the}} primary goals for Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter was to [...] "tone down the insanity" [...] that occurred onscreen when compared to X-Men vs. Street Fighter. The developers also sought to achieve balance within the character roster; the previous title had gained a reputation for being [...] "broken", with characters having access to one or more [...] These changes, however, were met with negative reception from fans, who criticized the game for offering less freedom. This ultimately led to Capcom recognizing the theme of insanity as the hallmark of the series and using it as a focus for future Marvel vs. Capcom installments.|$|E

500|$|LucasArts's game {{producer}} Craig Derrick and {{his team}} conceived {{the idea of the}} remake in 2008. After researching the Monkey Island series' history, they decided to make [...] "something fresh and new while staying true to the original", which resulted in the idea of The Secret of Monkey Island remake. The developers tried to leave much of the original design unchanged. Any changes were intended to achieve the level of immersion desired for the original. To that end, they added details like a pirate ship or pirates talking in the background of scenes. While the team considered the SCUMM interface revolutionary at the time, LucasArts <b>community</b> <b>manager</b> Brooks Brown noted that it is incompatible with an analog stick, which most consoles use. The designers made the cursor contextual to the game objects as the primary interface. Brown had considered updating the reference to advertise [...] because Loom was not on the market at the time, but concluded that the game would not be the same if such changes were implemented. Prior to the Special Edition release, however, LucasArts announced that Loom, along with other games from its back catalog, would be made available on Steam.

500|$|For the Forces of Corruption {{expansion}} pack, he took greater creative liberty {{with the}} Star Wars feel by writing an original {{theme for the}} new criminal faction. In attempting to compose this piece, he wrote several preliminary hooks that were later integrated into the game's battle themes. He composed six pieces for the expansion total, including the finale theme. In line with the criminal theme of the game, Klepacki borrowed motifs and recreated the mood from scenes involving Jabba the Hutt in Return of the Jedi. His score for the expansion pack was accepted upon first submission to LucasArts. As Petroglyph's audio director, he also selected sound effects—a tricky process due {{to the issue of}} making the criminal faction's sounds a [...] "little different, without straying too much from the original signature sounds." [...] Klepacki worked with LucasArts to select voice actors, and contributed his own talents to the role of IG-88 and other minor characters. A blooper reel of his voice acting was released on Petroglyph's forums after the one-thousandth member registered. Klepacki was contacted to score Command & Conquer 3, but was too busy with duties at Petroglyph and declined to mention the offer publicly. Electronic Arts hired Steve Jablonsky to score the game; an EA <b>community</b> <b>manager</b> at C 3s forums suggested that the audio team studied Klepacki's music and tried to recreate his style.
