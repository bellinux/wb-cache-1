40|$|Nuclear {{power and}} solar {{photovoltaic}} energy conversion often compete for policy support that governs economic viability. This paper compares current subsidization {{of the nuclear}} industry with providing equivalent support to manufacturing photovoltaic modules. Current U. S. <b>indirect</b> nuclear insurance <b>subsidies</b> are reviewed and the power, energy and financial outcomes of this <b>indirect</b> <b>subsidy</b> are compared to equivalent amounts for <b>indirect</b> <b>subsidies</b> (loan guarantees) for photovoltaic manufacturing using a model that holds economic values constant for clarity. The preliminary analysis indicates that if only this one relatively ignored <b>indirect</b> <b>subsidy</b> for nuclear power was diverted to photovoltaic manufacturing, it would result in more installed power and more energy produced by mid-century. By 2110 cumulative electricity output of solar would provide an additional 48, 600 Â TWh over nuclear worth $ 5. 3 trillion. The results clearly show that {{not only does the}} <b>indirect</b> insurance liability <b>subsidy</b> play a significant factor for nuclear industry, but also how the transfer of such an <b>indirect</b> <b>subsidy</b> from the nuclear to photovoltaic industry would result in more energy over the life cycle of the technologies.

In my third and fourth chapter I describe functioning of two different systems - for my paper I have chosen Hungary and Luxembourg.

We disentangle conflicting definitions of moderated mediation and describe approaches for estimating and testing a variety of hypotheses involving <b>conditional</b> <b>indirect</b> effects. We introduce standard errors for hypothesis testing and construction of confidence intervals in large samples but advocate that researchers use bootstrapping whenever possible. We also describe methods for probing significant <b>conditional</b> <b>indirect</b> effects by employing direct extensions of the simple slopes method and Johnson-Neyman technique for probing significant interactions.

This article develops a transparent method to determine the environmental impact of <b>indirect</b> government <b>subsidies</b> and derive policy lessons.

Use of the method will provide a basis for formulating corrective policy. The method is applied to several important subsidies in the Netherlands, in agriculture, energy and transport sectors.

The distribution of subsidies in the private sector is distinctly pro-poor, but this is not true in the public sector.

The proposed model was tested using a large sample of workers from several organisations in Australia. Results were consistent with the suggestion that biologically based dimensions of personality are both distal predictors and proximal moderators of leadership effectiveness. Cognitive dimensions were found to be proximal predictors (mediators) of Leadership Effectiveness.
