2500|$|It is a <b>common</b> {{misconception}} <b>persimmon</b> fruit needs frost {{to ripen}} and soften, called bletting. Some, {{such as the}} early-ripening varieties [...] "pieper" [...] and [...] "NC21"(also known as [...] "supersweet"), easily lose astringency and become completely free of it when slightly soft at the touchâ€”these are then very sweet, even in the British climate. On the other hand, some varieties (like the very large fruited [...] "yates", which is a late ripening variety) remain astringent even when the fruit has become completely soft (at least in the British climate). Frost, however, destroys the cells within the fruit, causing it to rot instead of ripen. Only completely ripe and soft fruit can stand some frost; it will then dry and become even sweeter (hence the misconception). The {{same goes for the}} Oriental persimmon (Diospyros kaki), where early frost can severely damage a fruit crop.|$|R

Coves support tulip poplar, oak and hemlock, some very large; the crest of Apple Orchard Mountain has a mix of hardwoods such as red and white oak as well as <b>common</b> <b>persimmon,</b> red spruce and hemlock; and the harsh environment of the dry western slopes support pitch pine, Virginia pine and chestnut oak.|$|E
