50|$|CD {{moulding}} {{machines are}} specifically designed high temperature polycarbonate injection moulders. They have an average throughput of 550-900 discs per hour, per moulding line. Clear polycarbonate pellets are first dried at around 130 degrees Celsius for three hours (nominal; this depends on which optical grade resin is in use) and are fed via vacuum transport into {{one end of the}} injection moulder's barrel (i.e., the feed throat) and are moved to the injection chamber via a large screw inside the barrel. The barrel, wrapped with heater bands ranging in temperature from ca 210 to 320 degrees Celsius melts the polycarbonate. When the mould is <b>closed</b> the <b>screw</b> moves forward to inject molten plastic into the mould cavity. When the mould is full, cool water running through mould halves, outside the cavity, cools the plastic so it somewhat solidifies. The entire process from the mould closing, injection and opening again takes approximately 3 to 5 seconds.|$|R

40|$|As part of {{the joint}} project on extra-corporal {{treatment}} of liver cancer by BNCT between JRC Petten and the University Hospital Essen, a facility has been designed and built to contain the liver during its irradiation treatment at the HFR Petten. The design consists of a rotating spheroid shaped PMMA holder, manufactured to open at the equator and <b>closed</b> by <b>screwing</b> together, surrounded by PMMA and graphite blocks. A validation exercise has been performed regarding both the nuclear conditions and the physical conditions. For the former, activation foil sets of Au, Cu and Mn, were irradiated at positions inside the liver holder filled with water, whilst a second measurement campaign has been performed using gel dosimetry. For the physical test, it is required to operate (rotate) the facility for up to 4 hours and to maintain the liver at approximately 4 oC.

30|$|The static {{surfactant}} adsorption {{was measured}} in the absence and presence of different alkali concentrations.

Consequently, the samples were <b>closed</b> with phenolic <b>screw</b> caps to limit the evaporation during the equilibration period of 5  days at 90  °C. After the equilibrium time, the surfactant concentration in each sample was determined by comparing the refractive index values after equilibrium with the initially plotted calibration curves.|$|R

40|$|When using locked plating for bone {{fracture}} fixation, screw loosening is reported {{as one of}} the most frequent complications and is commonly attributed to an incorrect choice of screw configuration. Choosing a patient-optimized screw configuration is not straightforward as there are many interdependent variables that affect device performance. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence that locking screw configuration has on loosening risk and how this is influenced by bone quality. This study uses finite element models that incorporate cortical bone heterogeneity, orthotropy, and geometrical nonlinearity to examine the effect of screw configuration on variables associated with loosening and interfragmentary motion. Strain levels within the bone were used as indicators of regions that may undergo loosening. The study found that, in healthy bone under axial loading, the most important variables influencing strain levels within the bone were the size of the bridging span (working length) and the plate rigidity. Unlike healthy bone, osteoporotic bone was found to be particularly sensitive to the spacing of the screws within the plate. Using two empty screw holes between the <b>screws</b> <b>closest</b> to the fracture was found to reduce the strain levels at the first screw by 49 % in osteoporotic bone (compared to only 2. 4 % in healthy bone). The study also found that under torsional loading the total number of screws used was the most important variable with a 59 % reduction in the strain around the <b>screws</b> <b>closest</b> to the fracture when using six rather than four screws in osteoporotic bone...|$|R

40|$|Commercial epilayers {{are known}} to contain a variety of crystallographic imperfections. {{including}} micropipes, <b>closed</b> core <b>screw</b> dislocations. low-angle boundaries, basal plane dislocations, heteropolytypic inclusions, and non-ideal surface features like step bunching and pits. This paper reviews the limited present understanding of the operational impact of various crystal defects on SiC electrical devices. Aside from micropipes and triangular inclusions whose densities have been shrinking towards manageably small values in recent years, many of these defects appear to have little adverse operational and/or yield impact on SiC-based sensors, high-frequency RF, and signal conditioning electronics. However high-power switching devices used in power management and distribution circuits have historically (in silicon experience) demanded the highest material quality for prolonged safe operation, and are thus more susceptible to operational reliability problems that arise from electrical property nonuniformities likely to occur at extended crystal defects. A particular {{emphasis is placed on}} the impact of closed-core screw dislocations on high-power switching devices, because these difficult to observe defects are present in densities of thousands per cm,in commercial SiC epilayers. and their reduction to acceptable levels seems the most problematic at the present time...|$|R
