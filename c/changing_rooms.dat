5|$|Rugby: A {{section of}} the {{grassland}} {{to the north of}} the Roehampton Gate is maintained and laid out during the winter months for rugby; there are three pitches. At weekends, this area is hired extensively to Rosslyn Park Rugby Football Club.

5|$|The stadium's clubhouse (named the Portway Suite) is also {{situated}} on this elevated side, {{just inside the}} turnstiles.

5|$|Harrison Park {{lies on the}} {{outskirts}} of Leek and has been the team's home since 1948, when the club purchased what was then called Hamil Park for £1,250. <b>Changing</b> <b>rooms</b> were constructed in the 1950s (previously the players had been obliged to change in a nearby pub), along with the first covered accommodation for spectators, and floodlights (which had previously belonged to the defunct Rugby Town) were erected in 1972, soon after which the stadium was renamed Harrison Park after former club chairman Geoff Harrison.|$|E

50|$|Mr Rowan {{applied for}} a job in Etam plc’s women’s {{clothing}} shop.

50|$|The renovations {{from this}} period include moving the away teams's <b>changing</b> <b>room</b> to {{the eastern part of}} the stadium. In order to connect the <b>changing</b> <b>room</b> with the field a tunnel was built under the east and north stand, this {{slightly}} affected the overall capacity of the stadium.|$|R
5|$|The {{construction}} of the New Building started in 1958 in the grounds of Allen House and initially consisted of a gymnasium, assembly hall, dining hall and kitchens, caretaker's flat, staff common rooms, junior library, cloakrooms and <b>changing</b> <b>rooms,</b> eight classrooms, science lecture theatre, five science laboratories, geography and art rooms, and various offices, stores and smaller rooms arranged in a J shape. The {{construction of}} the initial building was finished in 1963.|$|E
5|$|A {{rectangular}} swimming area on {{the southern}} bank was opened in 1930. Known as Lansbury's Lido, it is partitioned {{off from the rest}} of the lake by a perimeter of buoys. There is a fee for entering the lido, and <b>changing</b> <b>rooms</b> are available. It is normally open only in the summer, typically between 10:00 and 17:30, although members of the Serpentine Swimming Club may swim all the year round from 06:00 to 09:30. The Peter Pan Christmas Day Race is only open to regular participants in the Saturday swimming competitions during the winter.|$|E
5|$|F.C. United {{play at the}} 4,400 {{capacity}} Broadhurst Park, {{which opened}} in May 2015. The ground was built {{at a cost of}} £6.3 million, using £2 million from a Community Share Scheme and the remainder from a variety of governmental and charity grants. The ground is surrounded on all sides by covered stands: the St. Mary's Road End (east), the North Stand, the Lightbowne Road End (west) and the Main Stand (south), the latter of which has seating sections. Within the Main Stand is a clubhouse with a bar and catering facilities, club offices, <b>changing</b> <b>rooms,</b> a medical suite and a classroom. The stadium is shared with a local junior team, Moston Juniors F.C.|$|E

5|$|On 7 April 1967, the {{grandstand}} caught {{fire and the}} entire structure burned down beyond repair. The buildings and stands were subsequently demolished. At the same time, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration proposed that the Fetveien road, which runs {{to the south of}} the stadium, should be moved to run through the stadium, which would have required the stadium to be moved. However, the Public Roads Administration abandoned their plans and a building permit was issued. New <b>changing</b> <b>rooms,</b> club house and terraces were completed in September 1968.|$|E
5|$|Previously, {{the club}} {{played at the}} Walled Meadow, near to the town centre. The ground had a main wooden stand along one side (which {{incorporated}} the <b>changing</b> <b>rooms),</b> and a bank of covered terracing on the opposite side. The ground was mainly accessed via the car park off London Road, with turnstiles also situated on Eastfield Road behind the main stand. Since the club left the Walled Meadow in 1989, the ground has been demolished and the site is now used for a housing development of the same name.|$|E
5|$|The club spent £1,400 {{appointing}} {{designers to}} oversee the excavation and levelling of the land, and moved a one-year-old stand from Carlisle Road to the highest {{part of the new}} ground. The original ground comprised the relocated stand, a 2,000-capacity stepped enclosure with the players' <b>changing</b> <b>rooms</b> beneath the stand, the playing area, a cinder athletics track and fencing to limit the total capacity to 18,000. The playing field was made of ballast, ashes, soil and sods. The ground was officially opened on 27 September 1886 for a game against Wakefield Trinity which was watched by a capacity crowd, but construction work meant most of Manningham's early games were away fixtures.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of the 2003 {{municipal}} elections, the Labour Party mayor {{candidates for}} the municipalities of Skedsmo, Rælingen and Lørenskog, Andreas Hamnes, Terje Granerud and Åge Tovan, proposed that a central, inter-municipal athletics venue be built for Nedre Romerike. The proposal was followed up by the three athletics clubs in the area, Minerva IS, Strømmen IF and Lørenskog FIL, who established a committee. Several locations were considered, but the committee landed on Lillestrøm idrettspark because {{of the availability of}} existing utilities, parking and <b>changing</b> <b>rooms,</b> which would reduce the investment costs. In the process, Strømmen stadion was rejected because it was undergoing upgrades to receive artificial turf and Marikollen was deemed too remote. Also Nordlimyra in Lørenskog was deemed unsuitable. The choice of Lillestrøm idrettspark was selected by consensus among the municipalities and the sports clubs in June 2005.|$|E
5|$|Construction of Lerkendal {{started as}} a public works during the 1930s, as a measure to create jobs. It opened on 10 August 1947, and {{consisted}} of a main grass field, two gravel fields, two handball courts and two tennis courts. The main field had a spectator capacity for 37,000 on temporary stands, making it the second-largest stadium in the country. The long sides consisted of temporary wooden stands, with seating on the south stand and standing places on terraces on the north stand. The end sides of the stadium consisted of grass embankments at a 30 percent angle, allowing for standing space for spectators without having to build stands. <b>Changing</b> <b>rooms</b> were located in a nearby German-built barracks dating from the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{was mostly}} done by volunteers; the {{building}} of the stadium required 31,000 man-hours in volunteer work and cost NOK 150,000. After the land was cleared, a layer of mixed sand and earth were laid. The pitch, with the dimensions , was sown in mid-1950. The work also included a grandstand, <b>changing</b> <b>rooms,</b> a watering system and kiosks. The stand could accommodate 2,500 spectators, and the stadium had a total permitted capacity of 6,000 people. The inaugural match was played against Sarpsborg on 7 July 1951 in front of 3,500 spectators. A training pitch beside the stadium pitch opened in 1953. The following year, a new steel entrance was built, following in 1955 with a referees' changing room and administrative offices. In 1959, after eight years of planning, construction of an additional terrace started, which opened in 1960.|$|E

5|$|Records of men {{meeting for}} sex {{with other men}} in bathhouses {{date back to the}} 15th century. A {{tradition}} of public baths dates back to the 6th century BC, and there are many ancient records of homosexual activity in Greece. In the West, gay men have been using bathhouses for sex since at least the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a time when homosexual acts were illegal in most Western countries and men who were caught engaging in homosexual acts were often arrested and publicly humiliated. Men began frequenting cruising areas such as bathhouses, public parks, alleys, train and bus stations, movie theatres, public lavatories (cottages or tearooms), and gym <b>changing</b> <b>rooms</b> where they could meet other men for sex. Some bathhouse owners tried to prevent sex between patrons while others, mindful of profits or prepared to risk prosecution, overlooked discreet homosexual activity.|$|E
5|$|Richmond also {{planned to}} {{increase}} the main stand's capacity by a further 1,800seats by building new <b>changing</b> <b>rooms</b> and office blocks, and add a second tier to the Midland Road stand, {{to increase the}} ground capacity to more than 35,000. However, the club went into administration in May 2002, and Richmond was replaced by new co-owners Julian Rhodes and Gordon Gibb. The following year, Valley Parade was sold to Gibb's pension fund for £5million, with the club's offices, shop and car park sold to London-based Development Securities for an additional £2.5million. Bradford City's annual rent bill in 2011 to Gibb's pension fund is £370,000. The total budget for the year, including other rent payments, rates, maintenance and utility bills is £1.25million.|$|E
5|$|The Sunwin Stand {{has further}} room for expansion, and is unusual because it only runs {{three-quarters of the}} length of the pitch. The rest of this side is taken up by a brick building, {{situated}} in the south west corner of the stadium, which houses the club <b>changing</b> <b>rooms</b> and the security offices. The Sunwin Stand also includes the ground's 17executive boxes and conference facilities, which have capacity for up to 700people. A second function room, called the Bantams Bar, in the Kop, has room for another 300 people. There is also more office space, a club store, ticket office and museum in the car park behind the Kop. From early 2010, the area near the store will also include a dental surgery, which will be run by NHS Bradford and Airedale in partnership with the football club.|$|E
