40|$|Abstract. During milling of {{thin-walled}} components, chatter vibrations {{give rise}} to process issues. These include dimensional inaccuracy, damaged and scrap parts, and damaged cutting tools. This, in turn, leads to loss of production time with increasing cost as a consequence. This paper identifies the force profile during a single <b>cut</b> <b>milling</b> process. It focuses on the exit and post-exit behavior of the cut and discusses the process dynamics. The force profiles of various tool-to-workpiece positions are analyzed as regards the exit and post exit phases. A standard on-the-market cutter and a specially designed zero rake cutter {{are used in the}} investigation. Finally, a time-domain simulation of the force is performed and compared to the experimental results. The study concludes that a small change in exit angle may result in a considerable improvement in cutting behavior. In addition, the tool position should be chosen so that the cutter exits in the least flexible direction possible for the workpiece...|$|E
40|$|Three {{commercial}} silk varieties, namely mulberry, muga and eri, {{were used}} to prepare ultra-fine silk particles. Degummed silk fibres were chopped into short snippets and then pulverised using rotary and planetary ball milling. The effects of degree of degumming, size of milling media, water and lubricant on particle refinement were studied. Before milling, single fibre strength tests were conducted on silk fibres degummed under different conditions. The results indicate that while reducing fibre strength via harsh degumming could <b>cut</b> <b>milling</b> time drastically, too severe a reduction in fibre strength is actually detrimental to achievable minimum particle size due to increased particle aggregation. Water {{played an important role}} in affecting the performance of ball milling. With the milling processes used in this study, a volume based median particle size (d(0. 5)) of around 200 nm was achieved, which is much smaller than previously reported results. To achieve a similar particle size, mulberry silk required more milling time, even though the overall milling behaviour was quite similar for the three silk varieties examined. SEM observations revealed axial spitting and fragmentation of micro and nanofibrillar architecture of silk fibres due to milling. Unlike ball milling, which produced particles with variable shapes, rotary milled particles remained fibrous through the size reduction process...|$|E
40|$|For {{the first}} time, biocomposites from wheat by-products, i. e. wheat gluten and wheat straw fibers, were {{prepared}} using a thermomechanical process. Three types of wheat straw fibers displaying contrasted sizes (median diameter d(50) = 1. 1 mm, 62 mu m and 8 mu m), morphologies and surface reactivities were prepared by successive grinding processes (<b>cut</b> <b>milling</b> (CM), impact milling (IM) and ball milling (BM), respectively). The main {{objectives of the}} present study were (i) to gain further scientific knowledge about the impact of fibers characteristics on the mechanical properties of these composite materials, and (ii) to evaluate in which extent the addition of wheat straw fibers could decrease the final cost of materials without altering their mechanical properties. Mechanical properties were assessed through tensile tests and discussed in relation to the structure of materials, especially to the interfacial adhesion between the fiber and the matrix. Globally, an increasing fiber content up to 11. 1 vol% led to an increase in both the Young's modulus and the stress at break, and to a reduction in the strain at break. Experimental Young's moduli were well predicted by the Tsai-Pagano model for the three types of fibers. Data of specific mechanical energy consumed upon processing, contact angle measurements and observations of cryo-fractured surfaces allowed to demonstrate that the adhesion at the interface wheat straw fiber/wheat gluten was improved by (i) an increased hydrophobicity of wheat straw fibers, which was induced by successive grinding, and (ii) a higher specific surface of fibers which was favoured in the case of small fibers. The interfacial adhesion was improved in the order BM > IM > CM whereas the fiber aspect ratio decreased in the order CM > IM > BM. Thus, a competition between these parameters could occur, explaining why no significant difference in reinforcing effect was achieved between the three types of fibers. Finally, the reinforcing effect of wheat straw fibers was also ascribed to a deplasticizing effect, which was particularly pronounced for BM wheat straw fibers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
