5|$|In God Speaks, Meher Baba {{describes}} {{the journey of}} the soul from its original state of unconscious divinity to the ultimate attainment of <b>conscious</b> divinity. The whole journey is a journey of imagination, where the original indivisible state of God imagines becoming countless individualized souls which he likens to bubbles within an infinite ocean. Each soul, powered {{by the desire to}} become <b>conscious,</b> starts its journey in the most rudimentary form of consciousness. This limitation brings the need of a more developed form to advance it towards an increasingly <b>conscious</b> state. Consciousness grows in relation to the impressions each form is capable of gathering.|$|E
5|$|Checked {{exceptions}} are {{not present in}} C# (in contrast to Java). This has been a <b>conscious</b> decision based {{on the issues of}} scalability and versionability.|$|E
5|$|<b>Conscious</b> of his {{injuries}} {{at the start}} of the season, he did not compete after the World Championships, skipping the 2015 IAAF Diamond League final.|$|E
5|$|Damien Leith {{was also}} <b>conscious</b> {{of the lyrics}} we wrote. He added a few {{emotional}} ballads which contained strong lyrics, but had left out the songs he thought were too depressing.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{smoking in}} some of his films, Eastwood is a lifelong non-smoker, has been <b>conscious</b> of his health and fitness since he was a teenager, and {{practices}} healthful eating and daily Transcendental Meditation.|$|E
5|$|Regarding {{the primary}} {{function}} of <b>conscious</b> processing, a recurring idea in recent theories is that phenomenal states somehow integrate neural activities and information-processing {{that would otherwise}} be independent. This has been called the integration consensus. Another example has been proposed by Gerald Edelman called dynamic core hypothesis which puts emphasis on reentrant connections that reciprocally link areas of the brain in a massively parallel manner. Edelman also stresses the importance of the evolutionary emergence of higher-order consciousness in humans from the historically older trait of primary consciousness which humans share with non-human animals (see Neural correlates section above). These theories of integrative function present solutions to two classic problems associated with consciousness: differentiation and unity. They show how our <b>conscious</b> experience can discriminate between a virtually unlimited number of different possible scenes and details (differentiation) because it integrates those details from our sensory systems, while the integrative nature of consciousness in this view easily explains how our experience can seem unified as one whole despite all of these individual parts. However, it remains unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a <b>conscious</b> manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness. Nor is it explained what specific causal role <b>conscious</b> integration plays, nor why the same functionality cannot be achieved without consciousness. Obviously not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously (e.g., neural activity related to vegetative functions, reflexes, unconscious motor programs, low-level perceptual analyses, etc.) and many kinds of information can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness, as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect. Hence it remains unclear why any of it is <b>conscious.</b> For a review of the differences between <b>conscious</b> and unconscious integrations, see the article of E. Morsella.|$|E
5|$|Wagiman {{speakers}} are <b>conscious</b> of {{a distinction}} between two dialects of Wagiman, which they refer to as matjjin no-roh-ma 'light language' and matjjin gu-nawutj-jan 'heavy language'. The differences are minor and speakers have no difficulty understanding one another.|$|E
5|$|According to a SWOT {{analysis}} by MarketLine, Nestlé Purina Petcare's pet food brands that contribute substantially to revenue include Purina, Purina Dog Chow, Friskies, Purina Beneful and Purina ONE. Some brands, such as Alpo {{are intended for}} budget shoppers, while others like Purina ONE and Beneful cost more and are for health or ingredient <b>conscious</b> consumers. Purina ONE has been its fastest-growing brand.|$|E
5|$|After {{serving in}} the Senate, Johnston resumed his legal practice. He died in Richmond, Virginia, on February 27, 1889, aged seventy. He was <b>conscious</b> until his death and was {{aware that he was}} dying. On March 1, his family brought his body from Richmond to Wytheville, where he was buried in St. Mary's Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Being a political, {{religious}} and cultural centre of unique prestige and influence, Winchester, through the <b>conscious</b> efforts of its monastic school to standardize language, must also have become a factor of prime importance {{in the evolution of}} the literary standard in use throughout England in the late Old English period.|$|E
5|$|By 1968 the Americans {{were well}} aware of the scope and scale of the Cambodian {{logistical}} effort, but still remained reluctant to overtly violate Cambodia's neutrality since the U.S. still hoped to persuade Sihanouk to come on board against the communists. It was also <b>conscious</b> that any overt action might escalate the conflict into the international arena, possibly directly involving the Soviets and/or Chinese.|$|E
5|$|Christine Chism distinguishes racist or racialist {{elements}} in Tolkien's views and works as falling into three categories: intentional racism, unconscious Eurocentric bias, and an evolution from latent racism in Tolkien's early work to a <b>conscious</b> rejection of racist tendencies {{in his late}} work.|$|E
5|$|During the 1730s and 1740s, the Presbyterian Church {{was divided}} over {{the impact of}} the First Great Awakening. Drawing from the Scotch-Irish revivalist tradition, evangelical ministers such as William and Gilbert Tennent {{emphasized}} the necessity of a <b>conscious</b> conversion experience and the need for higher moral standards among the clergy.|$|E
5|$|Imogen {{assisted}} Britten {{with all}} his major compositions until 1964. At that point, <b>conscious</b> of time passing, she determined to give priority to the final securing of her father's musical legacy, and to re-establish her credentials as a composer. She relinquished her post as Britten's assistant to Rosamund Strode, although she did not leave Aldeburgh or break with Britten, continuing her work with the Aldeburgh Festival for a further 13 years.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Abdulkadir Ahmed Said {{released}} the Somali-Italian co-production La Conchiglia (Aleel). Another environmentally <b>conscious</b> short film, it predicted the devastating effects that illegal toxic waste dumping by foreign vessels {{would have on}} local marine life and the fishermen who depended on it.|$|E
5|$|In 738, Quiriguá, a vassal of Copán, Tikal's key {{ally in the}} south, {{switched}} {{allegiance to}} Calakmul, defeated Copán and gained its own independence. It appears {{that this was a}} <b>conscious</b> {{effort on the part of}} Calakmul to bring about the collapse of Tikal's southern allies. This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of Copán.|$|E
5|$|In {{psychological}} assessments, the name-letter {{effect has}} been exploited to measure self-esteem. There {{are two types of}} self-esteem: explicit self-esteem (a person's deliberate and <b>conscious</b> evaluation of themselves) and implicit self-esteem. Because by definition implicit self-esteem is not accessible to introspection, measures of it do not rely on direct self-reports but on the degree to which objects associated with the self generate positive versus negative thoughts.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} argued {{variously}} that the Eskaya are a remnant of the original indigenous settlers on Bohol; that they migrated to Bohol from Sumatra {{in the seventh century}} A.D.; that they are descendants of the resistance groups that fought under Francisco Dagohoy; that they are a cult or secret society; or that they are a <b>conscious</b> reconstruction of an imagined pre-colonial society.|$|E
5|$|Janet Damita Jo Jackson (born May 16, 1966) is an American singer, songwriter, {{dancer and}} actress. Known for sonically innovative, {{socially}} <b>conscious</b> and sexually provocative records, and elaborate stage shows, {{she has been}} a prominent figure in popular culture for over thirty years.|$|E
5|$|Physical trauma {{including}} tearing, friction or bumping of {{the piercing}} site, which may cause edema and delay healing. The risks can be minimized by wearing properly sized jewellery and not changing it unnecessarily, by not touching the piercing more than required for aftercare, and by being <b>conscious</b> of environmental factors (such as clothing) that may impact the piercing.|$|E
5|$|Subjective {{ownership}} {{would occur}} if subjects knowingly chose the letters {{from their own}} name. Nuttin ruled out a <b>conscious</b> response strategy in tests. Despite being given a monetary reward and unlimited time, none of the subjects of his original study {{were able to find}} a pattern in the stimulus lists, ruling out the possibility that they knew their own name-letters were there.|$|E
5|$|The Athsheans {{perceive}} the Terrans as an insane people, {{partly because of}} the disconnect amongst the Terrans between <b>conscious,</b> rational thinking and subconscious drives. The Terrans frequent use of hallucinogens is seen as the closest they are able to get to understanding their own subconscious. The psychological equilibrium which their dreaming gives the Athsheans is portrayed as the reason why they are able to live in balance with their ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|The Bahá'í {{writings}} {{describe a}} single, personal, inaccessible, omniscient, omnipresent, imperishable, and almighty God {{who is the}} creator of all things in the universe. The existence of God and the universe {{is thought to be}} eternal, without a beginning or end. Though inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as <b>conscious</b> of creation, with a will and purpose that is expressed through messengers termed Manifestations of God.|$|E
5|$|The {{season began}} in cold, wet {{conditions}} and Grace {{did not start}} well. He was <b>conscious</b> of his domestic and medical distractions, the most pressing {{of which was the}} birth of his daughter just before the famous match at Lord's between MCC and the Australians.|$|E
5|$|The {{thought of}} {{acting in a}} film had never even entered their minds. They're easy-going people, {{they have a good}} time {{in front of the camera}} and I don't think there was a single moment where either of them felt they were working. Paz, however, was {{definitely}} <b>conscious</b> of the fact that she was interpreting a role.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} that the cerebellum is involved in pain processing. The cerebellum receives pain input from both descending cortico-cerebellar pathways and ascending spino-cerebellar pathways, through the pontine nuclei and inferior olives. Some of this information is transferred to the motor system inducing a <b>conscious</b> motor avoidance of pain, graded according to pain intensity.|$|E
5|$|Thirdly, the teleological {{explanation}} of adaptation is uncomfortable {{because it seems}} to require backward causation, in which existing traits are explained by future outcomes; {{because it seems to}} attribute the action of a <b>conscious</b> mind when none is assumed to be present in an organism; and because, as a result, adaptation looks impossible to test empirically.|$|E
5|$|Titled after Saadiq's {{childhood}} nickname, Ray Ray features funky, groove-oriented {{songs and}} Saadiq's characteristic fusion of programmed beats, strings, neo soul melodies, and live guitar. They {{are arranged in}} a song cycle and touch on lighthearted romantic themes and socially <b>conscious</b> messages.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most animals, {{porpoises}} are <b>conscious</b> breathers. All mammals sleep, but porpoises cannot {{afford to}} become unconscious for long {{because they may}} drown. While knowledge of sleep in wild cetaceans is limited, porpoises in captivity have been recorded to sleep with one side of their brain at a time, {{so that they may}} swim, breathe consciously, and avoid both predators and social contact during their period of rest.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most animals, {{whales are}} <b>conscious</b> breathers. All mammals sleep, but whales cannot afford to become {{unconscious}} for long {{because they may}} drown. They are believed to exhibit unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, in which they sleep {{with half of the}} brain while the other half remains active. This behavior was only documented in toothed whales until footage of a humpback whale sleeping (vertically) was shot in 2014.|$|E

5|$|When Paramount {{announced}} its first slate of DVD releases in August 1998, First Contact {{was one of}} the first ten titles released in October, announced in a <b>conscious</b> effort to showcase effects-driven films. This version contained the feature and two trailers, but no other special features. The film was presented in a 2.35:1 anamorphic aspect ratio, with a surround sound Dolby Digital 5.1 audio mix.|$|E
5|$|When {{she became}} a mother in 1999, Thompson made a <b>conscious</b> {{decision}} to reduce her workload, and in the following years many of her appearances were supporting roles. She was not seen on screen again until 2000, with {{only a small part}} in the British comedy Maybe Baby, which she appeared in as a favour to its director, her friend Ben Elton.|$|E
5|$|While hunting near Merkinė (Merecz) {{in early}} 1648, Władysław {{suffered}} from a case of gallstone or kidney stone. His condition worsened due to an incorrect medication. He was <b>conscious</b> that those were his final days, and had time to dictate his last will and receive last rites. Władysław died around 2am on the night from 19 to 20 May 1648.|$|E
25|$|In {{a typical}} {{presentation}} of Panayiotopoulos syndrome, the child looks pale, vomits, and is fully <b>conscious,</b> able to speak, and understand but complains of “feeling sick.” Two {{thirds of the}} seizures start in sleep; the child may wake up with similar complaints while still <b>conscious</b> or else may be found vomiting, <b>conscious,</b> confused, or unresponsive.|$|E
25|$|These stages must {{be under}} <b>conscious</b> control by the singer until they become {{conditioned}} reflexes. Many singers abandon <b>conscious</b> controls before their reflexes are fully conditioned which ultimately leads to chronic vocal problems.|$|E
