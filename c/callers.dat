5|$|The app {{displays}} {{information on}} <b>callers,</b> {{such as their}} latest social media posts, local weather at the caller's location and {{the identity of the}} caller. It originally had the ability to display information on <b>callers,</b> such as their latest social media posts, local weather at the caller's location and the identity of the caller. The ability for consumers to add themselves to the directory was added in the summer of 2009 and being able to edit existing entries was added that October.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} tower collapsed, FDNY commanders issued {{evacuation}} warnings. Due to technical difficulties with malfunctioning radio repeater systems, many firefighters {{never heard the}} evacuation orders. 9-1-1 dispatchers also received information from <b>callers</b> that was not passed along to commanders on the scene. Within hours of the attack, a substantial {{search and rescue operation}} was launched. After months of around-the-clock operations, the World Trade Center site was cleared by the end of May 2002.|$|E
50|$|If {{the call}} {{originates}} on a POTS line (a standard loop start line), then <b>caller</b> ID {{is provided by}} the service provider's local switch. Since the network does not connect the <b>caller</b> to the callee until the phone is answered, generally the <b>caller</b> ID signal cannot be altered by the <b>caller.</b> Most service providers however, allow the <b>caller</b> to block <b>caller</b> ID presentation through the vertical service code *67.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the second}} call, the <b>caller</b> didn't say anything, but just breathed heavily. Manolo stayed quiet, also saying nothing. The <b>caller</b> then asked, [...] "You stay in silence, old faggot?". Manolo {{replied that he}} thought the <b>caller</b> was the <b>caller's</b> mother, masturbating him, and then hung up.|$|R
5000|$|Up {{until the}} phone lines were {{connected}} directly to Penn's house {{there would be a}} significant delay between the time Penn said the <b>caller's</b> name and when the <b>caller</b> would respond, this would sometimes result in the <b>caller</b> being dropped just after they said hello. There was also many times when the <b>caller</b> would be dropped completely and Penn would have to pick another <b>caller</b> from the list.|$|R
5|$|However, the ABC {{received}} more than 250complaints, outweighing the 177 positive submissions. A spokesperson for the national broadcaster said that the results were misleading because people who enjoyed the show typically do not make comments. Around the country, around 80% of <b>callers</b> to talkback radio were supportive; and one third of all calls regarding APEC mentioned the stunt.|$|E
5|$|Neighbors {{reported}} to the press that they had smelled a gas leak several hours before the explosion and had called Litoral Gas. Company director José María González said {{that the company had}} received no such calls, and thought that <b>callers</b> might have dialed the 911 emergency number instead. Prosecutor Camporini reported at the trial that the building had experienced several gas leaks before the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Potential contestants of the {{original}} primetime version had {{to compete in a}} telephone contest which had them dial a toll-free number and answer three questions by putting objects or events in order. <b>Callers</b> had ten seconds to enter the order on a keypad, with any incorrect answer ending the game/call. The 10,000 to 20,000 candidates who answered all three questions correctly were selected into a random drawing in which approximately 300 contestants competed for ten spots on the show using the same phone quiz method. Accommodations for contestants outside the New York City area included round trip airfare (or other transportation) and hotel accommodations.|$|E

Telstra operators will ask the <b>caller</b> if they require the [...] "Police, Fire, Ambulance?" [...] and their location if calling from a mobile phone or nomadic service. The <b>caller</b> is then connected to the relevant emergency service answer point as requested by the <b>caller.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, telemarketers are {{required}} to transmit <b>caller</b> ID. [...] This requirement went into effect on January 29, 2004.

50|$|The Dialogic {{cards are}} capable of making and {{answering}} calls, identifying <b>caller</b> ID, playing back sounds to the <b>caller</b> and recording sounds from the line, and detecting Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signals (touch tones) dialed by the <b>caller.</b> They can also tear down a call and detect when the <b>caller</b> has hung up.|$|R
5|$|The church {{formally}} {{announced the}} change on June 9, 1978. The story led many national news broadcasts {{and was on}} the front page of most American newspapers, and in most largely Latter-day Saint communities in Utah and Idaho, telephone networks were completely jammed with excited <b>callers.</b> The announcement was formally approved by the church at the October 1978 general conference and is included in LDS Church's edition of the Doctrine and Covenants as Official Declaration 2.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Andy {{shows up}} at Ann's house wearing a fancy suit. He tells her he has matured, gotten an office job {{and would like to}} get back together, but Ann declines. The camera follows Andy as he leaves, {{revealing}} he is actually living in a tent inside the pit. During the Pawnee Today show, Leslie and Marcia argue fiercely. Leslie insists she has not taken a political position, even after Marcia brings up the recent party at the Bulge. They take several <b>callers,</b> all of whom agree that Leslie should resign. Fed up, Leslie adamantly insists she will not resign, nor will she annul the penguin wedding. Later, she visits Ann and insists that Ann go on a date with Mark. The episode ends with Leslie driving the penguins from the Pawnee Zoo to a zoo in Iowa, where same-sex marriage is legal.|$|E
5|$|North Korea {{has set up}} {{specific}} government {{objectives for}} tobacco control {{and there is a}} national agency to implement them, with eight full-time staff members. Although there is no free of charge smoking cessation quitline that <b>callers</b> could phone and discuss their problems, most health-care facilities offer support in cessation, including cessation programs and nicotine replacement therapy. Costs are covered for the patient partially or in full by the state. In addition to regular health-care clinics, there are 11 specialized anti-smoking centers in the country where consultation is free, but medicine is not. Of medicines, bupropion and varenicline are not legally available in North Korea, but herbal medicines are used as smoking cessation aids.|$|E
50|$|In {{the sixth}} and final one, the <b>caller,</b> one more time with a high-pitched voice, said he was Manolo's anus. Manolo insulted him, telling the <b>caller</b> he didn't have a mother. The <b>caller</b> {{said that it was}} again a joke from El Vacilón, and Manolo insulted the <b>caller's</b> mother, and then he hung up.|$|R
50|$|An {{element of}} dynamic content can be {{introduced}} to the recording so that it responds to the <b>caller</b> ID in an intelligent way e.g. it could simply read out the <b>caller</b> ID of the <b>caller,</b> it could specifically advise what location the call is coming from, based on the <b>caller</b> ID, or it could check the <b>caller</b> ID against a customer database and therefore advise the agent which customer is calling in and what their account number is.|$|R

5|$|The Echo has won {{numerous}} accolades, as well {{as government}} praise, for its campaigning journalism, specialist writing, community work, photographic images and appeals for good causes over the decades. Examples of notable writing include a 2006 campaign highlighting {{the threat posed by}} bogus <b>callers</b> to the elderly and a 2005 campaign to protect 999 crews from being attacked on duty, which both received official praise in Parliament. A 1996 drug education campaign, which included the creation of a telephone service for tip-offs about suspected local drug dealers, was also highly praised. The Newspaper Society named the Echo as its Campaigning Newspaper of the Year for the Drug Busters drive, and the campaign also won an award from the International Newspaper Marketing Association.|$|E
5|$|The episode starred Pemberton, Shearsmith, Jane Horrocks, Nikki Amuka-Bird and Tony Way as {{volunteers at}} Comfort Support Line, a crisis hotline. The story follows Andy (Pemberton), who is {{starting}} at the call centre. After taking a particularly disturbing call from Chloe, a suicidal teenage girl, Andy begins to struggle, but he is offered support by his supervisor George (Shearsmith), the gossipy Liz (Horrocks) and the officious Joanne (Amuka-Bird). Andy is later joined by Michael (Way). Vilma Hollingbery, Vicky Hall {{and members of the}} comedy group Gein's Family Giftshop (Edward Easton, Kath Hughes and James Meehan) voiced various <b>callers,</b> with the Gein's Family Giftshop comedians also appearing as on-screen extras, playing unnamed call centre volunteers.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, with Obama {{elected president}} and his junior staffers working in the White House, Obama encouraged the group to hold the Seder again. The 2009 event {{was the first time}} that a sitting U.S. president conducted a Passover Seder in the White House. The White House switchboard was reportedly swamped with <b>callers</b> seeking a dinner invitation. The White House Seder was scheduled for the second night of Passover to allow Jewish staffers to spend the first Seder on the first night of Passover with their families. About 20 guests sat around a table in the Old Family Dining Room reading the Haggadah and sampling the traditional Seder foods. Malia and Sasha Obama, being the youngest in attendance, recited the Four Questions and engaged in the search for the afikoman.|$|E
50|$|When a {{cell phone}} {{receives}} a call made to an office number, the <b>caller</b> ID display would normally show the office as the <b>caller,</b> since the call is routed though the PBX. When the client software {{on the cell phone}} can pre-empt the built-in phone software (depends on the handset and client software vendor) this <b>caller</b> ID is suppressed and the mobility controller passes the correct calling number and name to the client software on the handset using the cellular data channel. Alternatively, depending on the PBX and carrier, the system may be able to insert the <b>caller</b> ID of the person calling into the regular <b>caller</b> ID notification (<b>caller</b> ID spoofing). This will show the 'correct' <b>caller</b> ID even on the built-in handset interface.|$|R
500|$|Four months later, on July 7, Savage {{was fired}} from his MSNBC {{television}} show after remarks made {{in response to a}} <b>caller,</b> later identified as prank <b>caller</b> Bob Foster, who insulted Savage's teeth.

5000|$|Support for Caller ID, if needed. [...] "Type-1 <b>caller</b> ID" [...] {{as used in}} North America {{is missing}} from the vast {{majority}} of modems.

5|$|David {{has been}} {{featured}} {{in a number of}} promotional materials for the Alien prequel films. For Prometheus, rather than focusing on the film's connection with the Alien canon, the marketing team emphasized central characters, most prominently David. On March 17, 2012, director Ridley Scott hosted a panel for Prometheus at WonderCon, where attendees were provided with Weyland Corporation business cards that provided a website and telephone number. Upon calling the number, <b>callers</b> were played an automated message that stated that Weyland Corporation's lines were busy, at which point a text message was sent that linked to a video narrated by Fassbender that showed David being unboxed, prior to his awakening. A month later, on April 17, an extended version of the unboxing video was released, with David providing additional insight into his function aboard the Prometheus as the ship's butler and maintenance man, as well as advertising his ability to seamlessly replicate human emotions without the restrictions of ethics or distress. Released with the video was also a poster featuring David, which was printed as a full-page advertisement in The Wall Street Journal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the broadcast of Part One, there was widespread debate among fans of the series as to who shot Mr. Burns. Fox offered a contest to tie in with the mystery where <b>callers</b> who dialed 1-800-COLLECT were eligible and they then guessed who the culprit was. It ran from August 13 to September 10 {{and was one of}} the first contests to tie together elements of television and the Internet. Fox launched a new website, www.Springfield.com, devoted to the mystery which got over 500,000 hits during the summer of 1995. The winner would be animated on an episode of the show. Due to contest regulations, a winner had to be selected out of a random sample of entries. The sample did not contain any correct answers, and so a winner (who had the wrong answer) was chosen at random. However, the winner, Fayla Gibson of Washington D.C., did not watch the show and opted to accept a cash prize in lieu of being animated.|$|E
