5|$|After the {{communist}} revolution in Afghanistan in 1978, authoritarian actions forced upon the populace by the Communist regime {{led to the}} Afghan civil war, with the mujahideen leading the popular backlash against the regime. The Soviet Union was worried that they were losing their influence in Central Asia, so after a KGB report claimed that Afghanistan <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> {{in a matter of}} weeks, Brezhnev and several top party officials agreed to a full intervention in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Slaves in Toraja society were family property. Sometimes Torajans {{decided to}} become slaves when they {{incurred}} a debt, pledging to work as payment. Slaves <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> during wars, and slave trading was common. Slaves could buy their freedom, but their children still inherited slave status. Slaves were prohibited from wearing bronze or gold, carving their houses, eating from the same dishes as their owners, or having sex with free women—a crime punishable by death.|$|E

5|$|After two weeks, {{when the}} {{dealership}} had sold every print it had, Ortiz removed the display. In {{a letter to}} the editor of The New York Times, he accused Comstock of causing the controversy to earn greater publicity for himself, and stated that he wearied of crowds outside his shop, who blocked paying customers from entering it. Ultimately, Comstock did not pursue legal action. The historian Walter M. Kendrick attributes this apparent leniency to September Morn status as a work of art, whereas Gerald Carson, writing in American Heritage, attributes it to a knowledge that no action <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> against the work.|$|E

5|$|Another {{individual}} {{known as}} Captain Haddock {{had lived in}} this period, who had commanded a fire ship, the Anne and Christopher. It was recorded by David Ogg that this captain and his ship had been separated from their squadron whilst out at sea and so docked at Málaga to purchase goods that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> back to Britain and sold for a profit. For this action, Haddock was brought before an admiralty tribunal in 1674, where {{he was ordered to}} forfeit all profits from the transaction and suspended from his command for six months.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Neil Hamilton Fairley and Major Ian Murray Mackerras visited Port Moresby in June 1942, {{and noted}} that the {{garrison}} had suffered 1,184 cases of malaria, an infection rate of 149 per thousand. They recommended that to conserve quinine, men <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> off it during the dry season, and observed for relapses. Fortunately, the climate in the Owen Stanley Range was not favourable to mosquitoes, and most cases were relapses by men infected in Port Moresby or Syria. Potts therefore decided on 24 August that anti-malarial precautions were no longer necessary.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert's son, {{also called}} Gilbert de Clare, {{inherited}} the castle, but he died fighting {{at the battle}} of Bannockburn in 1314 while still quite young. The family's lands were initially placed {{under the control of the}} Crown, but before any decision <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> on the inheritance, a revolt broke out in Glamorgan. Anger over the actions of the royal administrators caused Llywelyn Bren to rise up in January 1316, attacking Caerphilly Castle with a large force of men. The castle withstood the attack, but the town was destroyed and the rebellion spread. A royal army was despatched to deal with the situation, defeating Bren in a battle at Caerphilly Mountain and breaking the Welsh siege of the castle.|$|E

The Caucasus War was basically a 60-year-long siege.

5|$|Henry {{responded to}} the French and Angevin threat by {{expanding}} his own network of supporters beyond the Norman borders. Some Norman barons deemed unreliable were arrested or dispossessed, and Henry used their forfeited estates to bribe his potential allies in the neighbouring territories, in particular Maine. Around 1110, Henry attempted to arrest the young William Clito, but William's mentors moved him {{to the safety of}} Flanders before he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken.</b> At about this time, Henry probably began to style himself as the Duke of Normandy. Robert of Bellême turned against Henry once again, and when he appeared at Henry's court in 1112 in a new role as a French ambassador, he was arrested and imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|In 1827, at its peak, {{the canal}} {{transport}}ed 332,000 tons. The {{main purpose of}} the canal was still to transport coal to Givors, from where it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to other towns on the river Rhone. On the return trip, boats carried some of the merchandise of the Midi including iron, oak wood and other things needed by the factories of the Loire department. By 1831, the population of Givors had risen to 9,210. There were many factories making window panes, bottles and glasses, and the port had a busy trade in coal shipment. Ten large glass works had been established at Rive-de-Gier that also transported their products by the canal.|$|E

The plan did not receive the supermajority vote within the commission which {{it needed to be}} directly sent to Congress, and portions of the plan were rejected by both parties.|$|E

5|$|The adverse {{conditions}} {{faced by the}} keepers resulted in them receiving additional payments in kind, but the remote location suited some veterans. Archibald McEachern was assistant keeper for 14 years from 1870–84 and John Nicol was principal from 1890–1903. The latter {{was involved in a}} dramatic rescue when the liner Labrador en route from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Liverpool ran aground on the nearby Mackenzie's Rock in 1899. The lifeboats were manned and two made it to Mull, but one with eighteen passengers reached the lighthouse where they were looked after {{for two and a half}} days before they <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to the mainland. No lives were lost and Nicol and his two assistants were commended by the NLB for their efforts.|$|E
5|$|The aerial {{rules of}} {{engagement}} applied in Laos (which prescribed the offensive action of pilots and the locations and circumstances under which offensive actions <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken)</b> were created to protect the civilian population of the country. To the American pilots that conducted the missions, however, they became complex {{to the point of}} incomprehensibility. The rules were constantly altered and elaborated upon by the political decision makers in Washington and Vientiane and bore little relation to the reality on the ground. There were different rules for every type of activity, for each different branch of service, and in each military region.|$|E
5|$|The canal {{passes through}} a region which is largely rural, much of which is drained artificially. For most of its length, it is flanked by the North Soak Drain and the South Soak Drain, because it {{disrupted}} the established drainage scheme. Thorne Moors lie {{to the north and}} Hatfield Chase lies to the south. Until its demise in 1966, the canal was crossed by the Axholme Joint Railway at Ealand. The swing bridge was retained for several years after closure, so that stators from the nearby Keadby Power Station <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> away for repairs, as there were no road bridges which could support the weight.|$|E

5|$|Confident that he {{was being}} {{targeted}} by clubs from higher divisions, Bruce resolved not to sign a new contract with Gillingham when his existing deal expired {{at the end of the}} 1983–84 season. In an April 1983 match against Newport County, he attempted, in a moment of anger, to deliberately injure opposition player Tommy Tynan, but connected awkwardly and succeeded only in breaking his own leg, leaving him unable to play again for six months. He returned in time to play a key role in Gillingham achieving two draws against Everton in the FA Cup in 1984, attracting the attention once again of scouts from First Division clubs. Arthur Cox, manager of Bruce's beloved Newcastle United, expressed an interest in signing the player, but resigned from his job before any further action <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken.</b> Bruce eventually opted to sign for Norwich City in August 1984 for a fee variously reported as £125,000 or £135,000. In 2009, he was voted into Gillingham's Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Dazzle's {{effectiveness}} {{was highly}} uncertain {{at the time}} of the First World War, but it was nonetheless adopted both in the UK and North America. In 1918, the Admiralty analysed shipping losses, but was unable to draw clear conclusions. Dazzle ships were attacked in 1.47% of sailings, compared to 1.12% for uncamouflaged ships, suggesting increased visibility, but as Wilkinson had argued, dazzle was not attempting to make ships hard to see. Suggestively, of the ships that were struck by torpedoes, 43% of the dazzle ships sank, compared to 54% of the uncamouflaged; and similarly, 41% of the dazzle ships were struck amidships, compared to 52% of the uncamouflaged. These comparisons <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to imply that submarine commanders did have more difficulty in deciding where a ship was heading and where to aim. However, the ships painted in dazzle were larger than the uncamouflaged ships, 38% of them being over 5000 tons compared to only 13% of uncamouflaged ships, making comparisons unreliable.|$|E
