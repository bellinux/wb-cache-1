40|$|High-resolution {{satellite}} images {{have become a}} reality after several high-resolution satellites, such as IKONOS and QUIKBIRD, were launched with 1 m and 0. 61 m resolution, respectively, in panchromatic mode. These satellites may change the ordinary concepts of producing varied-scale maps, especially of urban areas, which are now normally based on aerial photographs. This paper focuses on two main issues: First, the attainable geometric accuracy of the digital maps generated from IKONOS satellite imagery by using different two-dimensional transformation models; secondly, the effect of variations in the elevation of the terrain on the resulting overall accuracy. Two typical cases were selected for this research and the attainable accuracy of the checkpoints versus the number and distribution of the ground control points (GCPs) was studied further. The first case is a relatively flat area {{in the city of}} Zagazig in Egypt, where the total variation in elevation is about 7 m in the area covered by the image. The second case is a hilly area of Hong Kong, with about 450 m variation in terrain elevation. The two-dimensional models used for the evaluation process include different orders of polynomials and projective models. Moreover, the determination of the effect of land topography, the selection of the best two-dimensional model and the optimum number of GCPs are all investigated in detail. Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that variations in terrain elevation significantly affect the accuracy of rectification. To achieve better rectification accuracy, ground points should be projected onto a <b>compensation</b> <b>plane</b> for hilly terrain, but they can be used directly without projection on flat terrain. Accuracy up to less than 1 m can be achieved by using most of the 2 D-transformation models after projecting ground points onto a <b>compensation</b> <b>plane</b> or onto flat terrain.

40|$|An image {{processor}} is discussed that combines {{many types of}} image enhancement onto a single compact electronics card. The current enhancements include bad pixel <b>compensation,</b> focal <b>plane</b> array non-uniformity correction, several stages of contrast enhancement, feature sharpening, superresolution, and image motion stabilization. Though there are certainly better algorithms for particular applications, this mixture of algorithms reliably enables the system to substantially improve image quality for a large variety of sensors, platforms, and imaging geometries. The card design hosted an FPGA and microprocessor facilitated rapid development by allowing many complicated algorithm elements to be quickly coded in C, with the FPGA providing horsepower for simpler but more computationally intensive elements.

The prevailing tax provisions make it possible to provide such plans at a substantially lower cost than that which would result if no special tax provisions were available. The loss of revenue to the Federal Government {{as a result of this}} special tax treatment is estimated to be more than one billion annually. In the past two decades tax considerations contributed strongly to the growth of indirect deferred compensation plans. This is due to, a great extent to sharp increases in corporate tax rates which add financial incentive toward the establishment of such plans. Economic and social developments that have characterized the past twenty year a, combined with the individual employee's sophisticated attitude towards income tax and it's resultant tax benefits, have greatly contributed to the expansion of such plans.

Physical parameters such as doses to the clinical target volume (CTV-T) and the planned target volume (PTV), heterogeneity index and doses to lung and heart were determined and compared for the treatment plans. Results: The ISC technique led to significantly better coverage of the CTV-T and PTV in almost all patients with statistically significant better homogeneity of the dose distribution. The contralateral lung and the heart receive the same doses with both ISC and 3 D-CRT plans. However, ISC showed a trend towards decreasing the volumes of the ipsilateral lung irradiated with high doses. Consequently this led to better compliance with the national recommendations for breast radiotherapy. Conclusion: The ISC technique leads to an improvement of the target coverage and the radiation burden of the ipsilateral lung thus allowing better compliance with the national recommendations and increasing the potential for improved {{quality of life for}} breast cancer patients. It should therefore be preferred over 3 D-CRT for breast cases with difficult dose homogeneity to the PTV or CTV-T...|$|E
40|$|In {{the absence}} of sensor {{calibration}} and satellite orbit information for Ikonos satellite imagery, empirical methods have to be adopted for the geometric correction of the images. This paper addresses two major terrain related issues. First, the paper focuses {{on the effects of}} terrain variation on the rectification accuracy of Ikonos images using various two-dimensional (2 D) transformation models. It was found that (1) the accuracy of rectified coordinates is significantly affected by elevation differences - the greater the differences, the lower the rectified accuracy; (2) for higher accuracy results, ground control points (GCPS) should be projected to a <b>compensation</b> <b>plane</b> before 2 D transformation models are applied; and (3) an accuracy of about 0. 5 m RMS error can be gained from rectified Ikonos images by utilizing most 2 D transformation models when accurate ground control points are available. Second, the paper addresses the effects of terrain variation and the number of GCPs on the obtained ground points accuracy when an eight-parameter affine model is used for 3 D ground points determination for stereoscopic Ikonos imagery. It was found that (1) non-collinearity-based 3 D orientation and triangulation model can be used successfully in most cases for 3 D ground point determination without the need for a camera model or satellite ephemeris data; (2) accuracy up to the sub-pixel level in the X-Y directions and about one pixel in the Z direction can be achieved; (3) the model works significantly better for hilly and mountainous areas than very flat areas; and (4) the accuracy of the results can be improved significantly either by increasing the number of GCPs or by adding topographic constraints.

30|$|The {{first one}} {{consists}} of a plasmonic metal-insulator-metal waveguide coupler (PWC) and a hyperbolic (or highly eccentric elliptic) metamaterial slab [118]. A plane wave can be focused to a point as it passes through a PWC and a metamaterial slab in order. When the incident plane wave excites the PWC, the waves with different transverse wavevectors and different phase transmit the metamaterial slab. By varying geometric parameters (width and height of the PWC), PWC can be designed so that the sum of phase gain from the metamaterial slab and from the PWC is a constant for every path. Under such a condition, plane waves interfere constructively at a point without loss of high spatial frequency waves thanks to unusual dispersion. Using this phase <b>compensation</b> mechanism, <b>plane</b> wave focusing and magnification are possible. Inversely, radiated beams from a point source are converted into a plane wave as they go through a metamaterial slab and a PWC. Without the PWC, a total internal reflection occurs when the waves with high wavevectors pass the exit surface of the lens, inhibiting the transmission of evanescent waves. But here, the PWC takes a role of bidirectional wavevector coupling and phase matching. The validity of the PWC-based metalens was demonstrated numerically [118].|$|R

40|$|One of the {{widespread}} issues in concrete structures is cracks occurring at early age.

Paper III, discusses the influence of five casting sequences for the typical structure slab-on-ground. The aim is to map restraints from adjacent structures for a number of possible casting sequences, and to identify the sequence with the lowest restraint. The paper covers both continuous and jumped casting sequences, which include one, two and three contact edges. The result shows that the best casting sequence is the continuous technique with one contact edge.

40|$|One of the {{widespread}} issues in concrete structures is cracks occurring at early age. Cracks {{that appear in}} the young concrete may cause early start of corrosion of rebars or early penetration of harmful liquids or gases into the concrete body. These situations could result in reduced service life and in significantly increased maintenance cost of structures. Therefore {{it is important for}} construction companies to avoid these cracks. Volumetric deformations in early age concrete are caused by changes in temperature and/or the moisture state. If such movements are restrained, stresses will occur. If the tensile stresses are high enough, there will be a damage failure in tension and visible cracks arise. These stresses are always resulting from a self-balancing of forces, either within the young concrete bodyalone, i. e. without structural joints to other structures, or from the young concrete in combination with adjacent structures through structural joints. The decisive situation within a young concrete body alone is typically high stresses at the surface when the temperature is near the peak temperature within the body. This situation occur rather early for ordinary structures, say within a few days after casting for structures up to about some meters thickness, but for very massive structures like large concrete dams, it might take months and even years to reach the maximum tensile stresses at the surface. Usually this type of cracks is denoted "surface cracks", and in some cases only a temperature calculation may give a good perception to make decisions of the risk of surface cracking. On the other hand, the decisive situation within a young concrete body connected to adjacent structures, might include both risk of surface cracking at some distance away from the structural joint and risk of through cracking starting in the neighborhood of the structural joint. If the young concrete body is small in accordance to the adjacent structure, or, in other words, if thereis an overall high restraint situation in the young concrete, the risk of early surface cracking might be out of question. So, restraint from adjacent structures represents one of the main sources of thermal and shrinkage stresses in a young concrete body. This study is mainly concentrated on establishing the restraint inside the young concrete body counteracted by adjacent structures, and how to estimate the risk of through cracking based on such restraint distributions. The restraint values in the young concrete are calculated with use of the finite element method, FEM. Any spatial structure may be analyzed with respect to the level of restraint. Calculations of risk of cracking are demonstrated with use of existing <b>compensation</b> <b>plane</b> methods, and a novel method denoted equivalent restraint method, ERM, is developed for the use of restraint curves. ERM enables the use of both heating ofthe adjacent structure and/or cooling of the young concrete, which are the most common measures used on site {{to reduce the risk of}} early cracking. In a design situation many parameters are to be considered, like type of cement, different concrete mixes, temperature in the fresh concrete, surrounding temperatures, temperature in the adjacent structure, measures on site (heating/cooling/insulation), sequence order of casting. Therefore, in general a lot of estimations concerning risks of cracking are to be performed. The main objective with the present study is to develop methods speeding up and shorten the design process. Furthermore, established restraint curves have been applied to the method of artificial neural networks (ANN) to model restraint in the slab, wall, and roof for the typical structure Tunnel. It has been shown that ANN is capable of modeling the restraint with good accuracy. The usage of the neural network has been demonstrated to give a clear picture of the relative importance of the input parameters. Further, results from the neural network can be represented by a series of basic weight and response functions, which enables that the restraint curves easily can be made available to any engineer without use of complicated software. A new casting technique is proposed to reduce restraint in the newly cast concrete with a new arrangement of the structural joint to the existing old concrete. The proposed technique is valid for the typical structure wall-on-slab using one structural joint. This casting method means that the lower part of the wall is cast together with the slab, and that part is called a kicker. It hasbeen proven by the beam theory and demonstrated by numerical calculations that there is a clear reduction in the restraint from the slab to the wall using kickers. Restraint is affected by casting sequence as well as boundary conditions and joint position between old and new concrete elements. This study discusses the influence of different possible casting sequences for the typical structure wall-on-slab and slab-on-ground. The aim is to identify the sequence with the lowest restraint to reduce the risk of cracking.

40|$|Too {{many times}} {{theories}} {{of how the}} human foot functions and therefore how mechanically inducted foot problems are treated have been presented {{as if they were}} facts. The dogmatic adherence that sometimes ensues from such an approach has frequently stifled the evolution of foot mechanics. This has been particularly apparent in the field of podiatry which has been dominated by the Root para-digm. Briefly, the Root paradigm proposes that the human foot functions ideally around the subtalar joint’s neutral position. Additionally, the forefoot to rearfoot frontal plane relationship ideally should be perpendicular. Furthermore, deviations from those ideal positions are termed deformities. [1, 2] Biomechanical treatments according to Root are intended to re-align the foot so as to function around the neutral subtalar position and/or prevent frontal <b>plane</b> <b>compensations</b> from a deformed forefoot. In essence this paradigm is based on foot morphology. Several studies have raised doubts as to the validity of the Root paradigm. [3 - 8] This abstract is a review of several papers which raise those doubts and explores emerging paradigms of human foot function which align more with current research findings on foot function.

40|$|SUMMARY This paper {{surveys the}} results of various studies on 3 -D image coding. Themes are focused on {{efficient}} compression and display-independent representation of 3 -D images. Most of the works on 3 -D image coding have been concentrated on the compression methods tuned {{for each of the}} 3 -D image formats (stereo pairs, multi-view images, volumetric images, holograms and so on). For the compression of stereo images, several techniques concerned with the concept of disparity compensation have been developed. For the compression of multi-view images, the concepts of disparity <b>compensation</b> and epipolar <b>plane</b> image (EPI) are the efficient ways of exploiting redundancies between multiple views. These techniques, however, heavily depend on the limited camera configurations. In order to consider many other multi-view configurations and other types of 3 -D images comprehensively, more general platform for the 3 -D image representation is introduced, aiming to outgrow the framework of 3 -D “image ” communication and to open up a novel field of technology, which should be called the “spatial ” communication. Especially, the light ray based method has a wide range of application, including efficient transmission of the physical world, as well as integration of the virtual and physical worlds. key words: 3 -D image coding, stereo images, multi-view images, panoramic images, volumetric images, holograms, displayindependent representation, light rays, spatial communication 1...|$|R
40|$|Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) is a {{powerful}} tool that strongly increases the field of investigation of classical microscopy. It allows {{to be used as}} phase contrast microscopy with the additional information of the z position over a whole experimental volume by acquiring a single frame. The use of a spatially reduced coherent source strongly reduces the coherent noise. Vesicles are close lipid membranes enclosing a sugar-water solution. Those biomimetic deformable objects are good mechanical models of living cells such as Red Blood Cells. We investigate the dynamics of a vesicle suspension in shear flow between walls (with a gap of about 200 μm). When vesicles are placed in a shear flow, they undergo a lift force that pushes them away from the wall until they reach the centre of the channel where the effects of both walls are compensated. On the other hand, hydrodynamical interactions between vesicles and segregation effects tend to push small vesicles away from the centre of the channel. The final distribution is thus a compromise between both effects that structures the distribution and has strong impact on rheology. DHM with reduced coherence and specific related algorithms (phase <b>compensation,</b> best focus <b>plane</b> determination, segmentation,) provide a full description of each object in the experimental volume as a function of their size and shape. Results are provided and illustrate the quantification of the lift force and the hydrodynamical interactions (shear induced diffusion). © 2012 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

40|$|The {{development}} of the third generation light sources lead {{to the implementation of}} the top-up operation, when injection occurs while users collect data. The beam excursions due to the non-closure of the injection bump can spoil the data and need to be suppressed. In the horizontal <b>plane</b> <b>compensation</b> can be achieved by adjusting timing and kick amplitudes. The rolls of the kicker magnets create non-closure in the vertical plane and usually there is no means for correction. In the paper we describe proposed compensation scheme utilizing two skew quadrupoles placed inside the injection bump. The third generation light sources implement top-up operation firstly introduced at Advanced Photon Source. In this mode the circulating beam current is supported near constant by frequent injection of small charge, while photon beam is delivered for users. The beam perturbations caused by the mismatched injection bump can provide undesired noise in the user data. Usually the injection trigger is distributed to the users end stations so that those affected would be able to blank data acquisition. Nevertheless, as good operational practice such transients should be suppressed as much as possible. In the horizontal plane (which is commonly used for injection) one can adjust individual kicker strength as well as trigger delay while observing motion of the stored beam centroid. In the vertical plane such means are unavailable in the most cases. The possible solutions include dedicated weak vertical kickers and motorized adjustment of the roll angle of the injection kickers. Both abovementioned approaches are expensive and can significantly deteriorate reliability. We suggest two employ two skew quadrupoles (to correct both angle and position) placed inside the injection bump. In this case the beam position itself serves as measure of the kicker strength (assuming that kickers are well matched) and vertical kicks from the skew quadrupoles will be self synchronized with injection bump. In this paper we will consider the case when injection hardware (kickers and septa) are located in the same straight. Such an approach simplifies consideration but it can be generalized...|$|R
