City health line is an initiative started by NMC dedicated {{to the health of}} citizens of Nagpur. This includes providing computerised <b>comparative</b> <b>information</b> and action in the field to Local citizens. NMC runs three indoor patient hospitals including Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya at LAD square, Panchpaoli Maternity Hospital in Panchpaoli and Isolation Hospital in Immamwada. Besides, the civic body runs three big diagnostic centres at Mahal, Sadar and also at Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya. Apart from these, NMC has 57 out patient dispensaries (OPDs), including 23 health posts sanctioned under Union Government's schemes, 15 allopathy hospitals, 12 ayurvedic hospitals, three homoeopathy hospitals, three naturopathy hospitals and one unani hospital. In 2013, ABP News-Ipsos declared Nagpur the country's best city for health care services. The city is home to numerous hospitals, some run by the government and some private. Nagpur is a health hub for Central India & caters to a large geographical area arbitrarily bounded by Delhi in the North, Calcutta in the East, Mumbai-Pune in the West and Hyderabad in the South. People from Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana regularly come to Nagpur for their health needs. Nagpur boasts of super-specialty physicians & surgeons serving its population in both public sector government run hospitals and well equipped private hospitals catering to all strata of society. AIIMS Nagpur is the latest feather in the cap of Nagpur health care services.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background To date, online public {{healthcare}} {{reports have}} not been effectively used by consumers. Therefore, we qualitatively examined how healthcare consumers process and evaluate <b>comparative</b> healthcare <b>information</b> on the Internet. Methods Using semi-structured cognitive interviews, interviewees (n = 20) were asked to think aloud and answer questions, as they were prompted with three Dutch web pages providing <b>comparative</b> healthcare <b>information.</b> Results We identified twelve themes from consumers' thoughts and evaluations. These themes were categorized under four important areas of interest: (1) {{a response to the}} design; (2) a response to the information content; (3) the use of the information, and (4) the purpose of the information. Conclusion Several barriers to an effective use of <b>comparative</b> healthcare <b>information</b> were identified, such as too much information and the ambiguity of terms presented on websites. Particularly important for future research is the question of how <b>comparative</b> healthcare <b>information</b> can be integrated with alternative information, such as patient reviews on the Internet. Furthermore, the readability of quality of care concepts is an issue that needs further attention, both from websites and communication experts. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: The Internet is {{increasingly}} {{being used to}} provide patients with information {{about the quality of}} care of different health care providers. Although online <b>comparative</b> health care <b>information</b> is widely available internationally, and patients {{have been shown to be}} interested in this information, its effect on patients’ decision making is still limited. Objective: This study aimed to explore patients’ preferences regarding information presentation and their values concerning tailored <b>comparative</b> health care <b>information.</b> Meeting patients’ information presentation needs might increase the perceived relevance and use of the information. Methods: A total of 38 people participated in 4 focus groups. <b>Comparative</b> health care <b>information</b> about hip and knee replacement surgery was used as a case example. One part of the interview focused on patients’ information presentation preferences, whereas the other part focused on patients’ values of tailored information (ie, showing reviews of patients with comparable demographics). The qualitative data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using the constant comparative method. Results: The following themes were deduced from the transcripts: number of health care providers to be presented, order in which providers are presented, relevancy of tailoring patient reviews, and concerns about tailoring. Participants’ preferences differed concerning how many and in which order health care providers must be presented. Most participants had no interest in patient reviews that were shown for specific subgroups based on age, gender, or ethnicity. Concerns of tailoring were related to the representativeness of results and the complexity of information. A need for information about the medical specialist when choosing a hospital was stressed by several participants. Conclusions: The preferences for how <b>comparative</b> health care <b>information</b> should be presented differ between people. “Information on demand” and information about the medical specialist might be promising ways to increase the relevancy and use of online <b>comparative</b> health care <b>information.</b> Future research should focus on how different groups of people use <b>comparative</b> health care <b>information</b> for different health care choices in real life.

We explore what quality information people value, how they understand different measures of quality, and their preferences for different types of information. Method: Seven focus groups were conducted. Results: Participants’ preferences for types of information changed {{at different stages of}} the focus groups. Participants attempted to compare hospitals option-wise, building up an overall picture of the hospital's performance. Faced with abundance of conflicting criteria, participants attempted to make trade offs, but found it difficult. Older and less numerate participants used summative measures to overcome this difficulty. Some indicators were poorly understood and the multiplicity of formats and labels was confusing. Missing data were mistrusted. Conclusion: The presentation of information affects what information people value, how they understand and process it. The design of scorecards is crucial in order to support use of scorecards for informed patient choice. Practice implications: We offer guidelines for changing presentation of <b>comparative</b> quality <b>information</b> with the aim to improve its use by patients when choosing between hospitals, especially online...|$|R
