40|$|In a {{group of}} 18 {{subjects}} with acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT), evidenced by clinical examination and echo-color-Doppler, we examined the phenotypical expression of the polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) beta 2 -integrins (CD 11 a, CD 11 b, CD 11 c, CD 18), obtained by using a flow <b>cytofluorimeter.</b> The evaluation was performed before and after in vitro activation (prolonged for 5 and 15 minutes) with 4 -phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). In DVT subjects, at baseline, the phenotypical expression of CD 11 b was decreased and that of CD 11 c was increased when compared with normal controls; no difference was found in CD 11 a and CD 18 expression. In normal subjects PMN activation with both activators led to a constant increase of all PMN adhesion molecules; in DVT subjects CD 11 b, CD 11 c and CD 18 increased, while CD 11 a expression did not show any change. These data indicate {{the presence of a}} functional alteration in circulating PMN cells from patients with DVT...|$|E
40|$|SV 40 -transformed FR 3 T 3 rat {{cells were}} {{previously}} shown to exhibit different patterns of accumulation of the virus-coded T-antigen. One group of transformants accumulates T-antigen throughout the cell cycle, whereas in another group, only {{the cells in}} the G 2 phase of the cell cycle are stained by immunofluorescence with anti-T antigen antibodies. We investigated the mechanism involved by determining the amounts of early SV 40 RNA during the cell cycle. Cells in the various phases of the cell cycle were sorted from an asynchronously growing population using a flow <b>cytofluorimeter.</b> Determination of the amounts of viral RNA in the different nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA fractions showed that in transformants with a G 2 -restricted accumulation of T-antigen, viral RNA was present in G 2, to some extent in S, but could not be detected in cells in G 1. In contrast, equivalent amounts of viral RNA were detected in all the phases of the cell cycle in the other group of transformants. Cell sorting, performed after pulse-labeling the cells for 2 h with [35 S]methionine, confirmed that translation of the viral mRNAs occurred only in G 2 in {{the first group of}} transformants, and throughout the cell cycle in the second group...|$|E
40|$|Experimental and {{clinical}} evidence {{has shown that}} opioids significantly influence the immune system. Subjects who are addicted to opioids show a decrease of their immunological defences which is certainly due to poor hygiene in their life style but is also caused by other co-factors, such as a direct action of the opioids. In vitro {{studies have shown that}} opioids influence the innate as well as the specific immune function. In particular, they induce a decrease in the production of the antibodies. The apoptotic action of the opioids, which was demonstrated on the neural substrate, has also been shown in bone marrow derived cells such as macrophages, fibroblasts, and above all lymphocytes. These cells have opioid receptors on the surface. The present study evaluated the apopotic effect of mu receptor agonists (morphine and buprenorphine) and k receptor agonists (pentazocin) on the leukemic T cells. The effect was antagonized (could use a better word here ?) by naloxone to confirm a receptorial mechanism. The apoptotic effect was evaluated by detecting the hypodiploid peak (showed through iodide propitio) by means of a <b>cytofluorimeter.</b> The results showed that both morphine and buprenorphine induced a significant hypodiploid peak which was antagonized by naloxone. Also, pentazocin induces an analogous effect (again antagonized by naloxone) even if the peak was lower. In conclusion, one of the principal ways through which opioids influence the immunological system could be the induction of the immune cell apoptosis and this phenomena seems related to direct receptorial mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanism by}} which the lipido-sterolic extract of Serenoa repens (LSESr, Permixon) affects prostate cells remains to be fully elucidated. In androgen-independent PC 3 prostate cancer cells, the LSESr-induced effects on proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated by counting cells and using a FACScan <b>cytofluorimeter.</b> PC 3 cells were stained with JC- 1 dye to detect mitochondrial membrane potential. Cell membrane lipid composition was evaluated by thin layer chromatography and gas chromatographic analysis. Akt phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blotting and cellular ultrastructure through electron microscopy. LSESr (12. 5 and 25 microg/ml) administration exerted a biphasic action by both inhibiting proliferation and stimulating apoptosis. After 1 h, it caused a marked reduction in the mitochondrial potential, decreased cholesterol content and modified phospholipid composition. A decrease in phosphatidylinositol- 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2) level was coupled with reduced Akt phosphorylation. After 24 h, all of these effects were restored to pre-treatment conditions; however, the saturated (SFA) /unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) ratio increased, mainly due to {{a significant decrease in}} omega 6 content. The reduction in cholesterol content could be responsible for both membrane raft disruption and redistribution of signaling complexes, allowing for a decrease of PIP 2 levels, reduction of Akt phosphorylation and apoptosis induction. The decrease in omega 6 content appears to be responsible for the prolonged and more consistent increase in the apoptosis rate and inhibition of proliferation observed after 2 - 3 days of LSESr treatment. In conclusion, LSESr administration results in complex changes in cell membrane organization and fluidity of prostate cancer cells that have progressed to hormone-independent status...|$|E
40|$|Introduction : Tissue {{engineering}} is a developing strategy to replace or repair congenital or acquired large muscle defects {{and to improve}} the outcome of muscle dystrophies and others genetic deficiencies. Objectives : In our work we have combined cell biology and polymer chemistry to create in vitro the most appropriate microenvironment for satellite cells in order to regenerate muscle tissue in vivo. Methods : Following this propose, we have cultured satellite cells using single muscle fiber technique to obtain a pure myogenic cellular population. Flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscles of adult GFP positive mice were carefully removed. The single muscle fibers, obtained after enzymatic digestion, were plated in dishes coated with matrigel. The satellite cells obtained from the fibers were expanded and seeded on to polymers. The polymers were made in PLGA (polyglycolic acid), that dissolves progressively when inserted into the muscles, and, according to the chemistry, designed to align the cells {{and to create a}} well organized system to vehicle satellite cells in vivo. We performed biomolecular analysis (PCR and western blot) and we tested muscle markers expression, with immunostaining and <b>cytofluorimeter</b> investigation, to affirm that our polymers are a good support, maintaining cell myogenicity. The polymers, with incorporated GFP positive cells, have been introduced in tibialis anterior muscle of isogenic wild type mice after mechanical damage. At 1, 2, 4, 8 weeks the animals have been sacrificed and serial sections of treated muscle have been analyzed with immunofluorescence Results : We observed the in vivo activation of the transplanted satellite cells that were able to form fully differentiated muscle fibers. Furthermore the transplanted cells were also able to migrate from the polymer to the damaged situ. Conclusions : This strategy could be used in the future as therapeutic tool for degenerative muscle diseases and/or for large muscle defects...|$|E
40|$|The {{members of}} the Aurora kinases family, Aurora-A, -B and -C are serine/threonine kinases {{involved}} in the regulation of multiple aspects of chromosome segregation and cytokinesis, and alterations in their expression {{have been associated with}} malignant cell transformation, genomic instability and tumor progression. Deregulation of the expression of the Aurora kinases has been shown to occur also in testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) identifying them as putative anti-cancer therapeutic targets. In the present study, we evaluated the in vitro effects of the Aurora kinases inhibitor MK 0457 on proliferation, cell cycle, ploidy, apoptosis, and tumorigenicity on the TGCT-derived cell line NT 2 -D 1. Treatment of the cells with MK 0457 inhibited proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, with IC 50 = 17. 2 ± 3. 3 nM. The MK 0457 did not affect the expression of the 3 Aurora kinases, but prevented their ability to phosphorylate substrates relevant to the mitotic progression. Time-lapse experiments demonstrated that MK 0457 -treated cells entered the mitotic process but were unable to complete it, showing soon afterwards the classical morphological features of apoptotic cells. The induction of apoptosis was confirmed by <b>cytofluorimeter</b> analysis, showing that the treatment with MK 0457 for 6 h induced NT 2 -D 1 cells accumulation in the G 2 /M phase of the cell cycle and the appearance, at the later time point of sub-G 0 nuclei. The latter result was further corroborated by the detection of caspase- 3 activation following 24 h treatment with the Aurora kinases inhibitor. Finally, the MK 0457 completely abolished the ability of the NT 2 -D 1 cells to form colonies in soft agar. In conclusion, the above findings demonstrate that inhibition of Aurora kinases activity is effective in reducing in vitro growth and tumorigenicity of NT 2 -D 1 cells, and indicate its potential therapeutic value for TGCT treatment...|$|E
40|$|Background. Metformin {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prescribed}} hypoglycemic drugs of the first line of treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes (T 2 D). However, the mechanism of its therapeutic effect has not been sufficiently studied. At the same time, T 2 D is considered a disease of an inflammatory nature, wherein different immune responses are disturbed. However, only single articles are devoted to the role of the immune system in the mechanism of the therapeutic action of metformin. Purpose of the study. Elucidation of the question to what extent different types of leukocytes, immunophenotype of lymphocytes and some cytokines are involved in the mechanism of the therapeutic action of metformin. Materials and methods. A group of patients of both sexes with a newly diagnosed T 2 D with BMI of 33. 1 ± 1. 3 kg/m 2 who had not yet taken hypoglycemic agents and a group of normoglycemic healthy individuals of the same age and sex were examined. The number of leukocytes in blood was determined using the hematological analyzers, and the leukocyte composition — in Pappenheim stained smears. Immunophenotype of lymphocytes (CD 3 + T, CD 4 + T, CD 8 + T, CD 56 +) — by flow cytometry using the FACStar plus <b>cytofluorimeter.</b> The content of different cytokines (I- 1 b, TNF-a and IL- 10) — with immunosorbent ELISA assay. Results. The metformin therapy of newly diagnosed T 2 D patients with obesity leads to normalization of the increased number of leukocytes, neutrophils and monocytes, as well as a decrease in CD 4 + T cells in the blood, especially in patients with high BMI. A characteristic feature of the therapy is a sharp decrease in anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL- 1 b and TNF-a) that were elevated before treatment. The obtained data indicate significant disorders of natural and adaptive immunity in T 2 D and confirm the hypothesis about the inflammatory nature of this disease. Conclusions. The favorable therapeutic effect of metformin in T 2 D, especially complicated by obesity, is largely due to the normalization of inflammation and immunity indices...|$|E
