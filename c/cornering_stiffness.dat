40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} focused on the design of a control {{strategy}} for the path tracking of off-road mobile robots acting at high speed. In order to achieve high accuracy in such a context, uncertain and fast dynamics have to be explicitly taken into account. Since these phenomena (grip conditions, delays due to inertial and low-level control properties) are hardly measurable directly, the proposed approach relies on predictive and observer-based adaptive control techniques. In particular, the adaptive part is based on an observer loop, taking advantage of both kinematic and dynamic vehicle models. This multi-model based adaptive approach permits to adapt on-line the grip conditions (represented by <b>cornering</b> <b>stiffnesses),</b> enabling highly reactive sideslip angles observation and then accurate path tracking. The relevance of this approach is investigated through full scale experiments...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a robust yaw-moment controller design for improving vehicle handling and stability with considerations of parameter uncertainties and control saturation. The parameter uncertainties dealt with are the changes of vehicle mass and {{moment of inertia}} about the yaw axis and the variations of <b>cornering</b> <b>stiffnesses.</b> The control saturation considered {{is due to the}} physical limitations of actuators and tires. Both polytopic and norm-bounded approaches are used to describe parameter uncertainties, and a norm-bounded approach is applied to handle the saturation nonlinearity. The conditions for designing such a controller are derived as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). A nonlinear vehicle model is utilized to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The simulation results show that the designed controller can improve vehicle handling and stability, regardless of the changes in vehicle mass and moment of inertia and the variations of road surfaces and saturation limitations...|$|R

40|$|Sideslip angle {{could provide}} {{important}} information concerning vehicle's stability. Unfortunately direct measurement of sideslip angle requires {{a complex and}} expensive experimental set-up, which is not suitable for implementation on ordinary passenger cars; thus, this quantity has to be estimated starting from the measurements of vehicle lateral/longitudinal acceleration, speed, yaw rate and steer angle. According to the proposed methodology, sideslip angle is estimated as a weighted mean of the results provided by a kinematic formulation and those obtained through a state observer based on vehicle single-track model. Kinematical formula is considered reliable for a transient manoeuvre, while the state observer is used in nearly quasi-state condition. The basic idea {{of the work is}} {{to make use of the}} information provided by the kinematic formulation during a transient manoeuvre to update the single-track model parameters (tires <b>cornering</b> <b>stiffnesses).</b> A fuzzy-logic procedure was implemented to identify steady state or transient conditions...|$|R

However, the estimation of these angles requires a global vehicle model; unfortunately, the requirements related to the knowledge of the vehicle model are difficult to satisfy, {{this is due to the}} uncertainties which affect the parameters of the vehicle model, for example, the longitudinal speed that changes the values of the vehicle model parameters, the front and rear <b>cornering</b> <b>stiffnesses.</b> In order to overcome all these constraints on the knowledge of the vehicle model, a switched proportional integral H_∞ observer is proposed. This observer is designed using non-increasing condition applied on the Lyapunov functions. Sufficient conditions of global convergence of this observer are presented and proved. All these conditions are expressed in term of the linear matrix inequality (LMI).

A clear and simple criterion has been proposed to demonstrate how the handling behaviour is changed in the high lateral acceleration region.

40|$|Tractor and towed {{implement}} system {{models have}} become increasingly important for model-based guidance controller design, virtual prototyping, and operator-and-hardware-in-loop simulation. Various tractor and towed implement models have been proposed in the literature which contain uncertain or time-varying parameters. Sensitivity {{analysis was used to}} identify the effect of system parameter variation on system responses and to identify the most critical system parameters. Sensitivity analysis was performed with respect to three tire <b>cornering</b> <b>stiffness</b> parameters, three tire relaxation length parameters, and two implement inertial parameters. Overall, the system was most sensitive to the tire <b>cornering</b> <b>stiffness</b> parameters and least sensitive to the implement inertial parameters. In general, the variation in the input parameters and the system state variables were related in a non-linear fashion. With the nominal parameter values for a MFWD tractor, a single axle grain cart, and corn stubble surface conditions, a 10 % variation in <b>cornering</b> <b>stiffness</b> parameters caused a 5 % average variation in the system responses whereas an 80 % change in <b>cornering</b> <b>stiffness</b> parameters caused an 80 % average variation at 4. 5 m/s forward velocity.

This thesis concerns accurate plausibilisation of two of these sensors, namely the yaw rate sensor and the lateral acceleration sensor.

The unknown and time-varying <b>cornering</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> are adapted and other unknown quantities such as yaw moment of inertia is estimated. The Kalman filter transforms the measured signals into a sequence of residuals that are then investigated with the aid of various change detection methods such as the CuSum algorithm.

Therefore a laboratory abrasion and skid tester is used to obtain more insight in the contact of a tread compound with the road for dry conditions. In the experimental setup a small solid tire, with adjustable slip angle, is pressed on an abrasive corundum disk. The present friction between the abrasive disk and solid tire drives the tire and the resulting forces are measured with a triaxial force sensor. Several experiments under different normal loads, slip angles and velocities of the disk are conducted. To explain observed phenomena of lateral force measurements for a free rolling tire under a number of slip angles a FE model is used. The relevant parts of the setup are modeled in Abaqus and the steady state performance of the small tire under different slip angles is evaluated.

40|$|With {{the ever}} {{increasing}} demand of cars, safety is of prime concern to automobile manufactures across the world. Companies strive for {{the vision of}} "Zero accidents" through high quality and innovative products that reduce the frequency of accidents {{as well as their}} consequences. The auto industry has been exerting a myriad of state-of-the-art technologies to make automotive safety systems that reduce driver’s strain and fatigue and assist safe driving. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are technologies that capture the vehicle’s surrounding environment and assist the driver by keeping him informed about the current vehicle state, and if necessary intervene to prevent an impending danger, while the driver is in control of the vehicle at all times. Vehicle Dynamics Control (VDC) systems enhance the handling and safety of the car by assisting the driver in maintaining control of the vehicle. However, these features are limited by lack of knowledge of the vehicle states. Some of the vehicle states like sideslip angle are not measurable due to technical or economic reasons. Therefore, these must be estimated by using the available measurements. Most of the existing sideslip angle estimators are based on lateral acceleration, but these estimators have estimation errors arising from roll and pitch dynamics. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop an algorithm that estimates the vehicle sideslip angle and tire <b>cornering</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> using tire force measurements.

40|$|The {{influence}} of temperature on tire performance is subject of matter in Research for many years. It {{is well known}} that the temperature affects the grip level of the tire and the <b>cornering</b> <b>stiffness</b> at the same time. Anyway, while the {{influence of}} temperature on grip level has been deeply investigated in different activities, the influence on <b>cornering</b> <b>stiffness</b> seems to be not sufficiently discussed yet. As shown in this work, the reason could be that the <b>cornering</b> <b>stiffness</b> is not influenced by the surface temperature – i. e. the temperature that can be measured on the tread surface – but instead by the bulk temperature – i. e. the core of the tire that means everything is between tread surface and inner liner. Again, different mathematical models, more or less complex, have been developed to simulate the tire performance during the last 20 years. Anyway, one limit of all these models is that they do not consider the influence of temperature. The purpose of the entire activity has been deeply investigating the influence of the bulk temperature on tire <b>cornering</b> <b>stiffness</b> also implementing a thermal model able to estimate this temperature correcting the <b>cornering</b> <b>stiffness</b> in consequence. Indoor and outdoor tests have been conducted for the purpose. In particular the activity was focused on the linear range of the tire lateral characteristic (slip angle limited to +- 1 °). The indoor test campaign has been performed on the Flat Trac machine using a tire equipped with particular sensors developed by the TUV Automotive and named T 3 M sensors. These sensors consist of thermo resistances temperature sensitive that can be introduced in the bulk of a tire. Different procedures to evaluate the <b>cornering</b> <b>stiffness</b> have been performed. The results have been surprising in terms of the temperature reached during the test. The procedures gave back significant difference on bulk temperature involving in considerable different <b>cornering</b> <b>stiffness</b> characteristics. The outdoor tests have been conducted on the oval track of the Bridgestone European Proving Ground, remaining in the linear range of the characteristic. Also in this case the results have been surprising for some aspects: the tires reached very high bulk temperatures saturating at a value that depends on vertical load (that means the loads on the corners) and on angular velocity (that means the roadway speed). Furthermore the test showed a deep difference between inside and outside shoulder of the tire. This is in line with the negative camber angle influence that loads the inside shoulder more than the outside. A thermal model has been developed to evaluate the bulk temperature of a tire during its exercise and correcting the <b>cornering</b> <b>stiffness</b> – through Pacejka formulation – taking into account the influence of the temperature itself. The model is physical, the thickness of the tire is divided into two layers: for both the equations of thermal diffusivity have been written in Matlab/Simulink environment. A physical model has been implemented even to evaluate the Strain Energy Loss (SEL) – i. e. the energy dissipated by hysteresis. The SEL model is based on different simplifying assumptions that did not influence the results anyway. All the parameters are easily measurable and the model needed no tuning. In fact even if a certain numbers of scaling factors have been introduced, all of them have been set to 1; few corrections have been needed in the SEL model; anyway always close to unit (0. 95 - 1. 1 the maximum variations). The model has been validated comparing the simulations with the indoor measurements and it appeared very satisfactory. The SEL model in particular gives back great results, taking into account in the right way as the influence of the vertical load as the influence of the roadway speed; this has been confirmed for very different tire specifications (different sizes, different compounds and different constructions) ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{particular}} structural system for high-rise structures is discussed: the prefabricated concrete framed tube and tube-in-tube structures. These system {{consist of a}} prefabricated concrete perforated elements in {{the perimeter of the}} structure that are the main lateral load resisting elements in the building. For tube-in-tube structures, the perimeter elements work together with a structural core that also resists the high lateral loads that are due to the wind loading on high rise structures. The thesis starts with a literature study on multiple aspects that are associated with the subject. First, an introduction into prefabricated high-rise and framed tube structures is given and some key behaviors and elements of this kind of structures are explained, such as the shear lag effect and aspects of connections between prefabricated elements. Hereafter, previous research associated with the subject is described. Most of these titles are Master's Theses from Delft University of Technology, which is at the forefront for research on prefabricated concrete high-rise structures. Other references found are articles published in Asian countries or the United States of America, but those tend to focus on cast-in-place framed tube structures. Finally, sources describing the connection between elements are described, which is an important parameter in prefabricated concrete shear wall structures. The literature study continues with an analysis of prefabricated high-rise structures in the Netherlands. It presents different structures already constructed and their relevance to the subject of the thesis. Also a description of the Dutch high-rise market is given as well as the justification for the construction of high-rise towers in this market. The literature study leads to the section on the missing links in research and the research questions associated with these missing parts of information available in literature. As a result, the research part of the thesis is divided into three parts: - Shear lag effect of non-rectangular framed tube structures - Structural behavior of prefabricated framed tube structures - Case Study Zalmhaventoren: Potential of fully prefabricated tube-in-tube structures These missing links lead to two separate parts of this thesis. Firstly a parameter research was done to answer the research questions associated with the first two missing links. This parameter research tries to answer research questions such as: “How do framed tube structures without a rectangular floor plan behave with respect to shear lag?” and describes the relation between parameters such as aspect ratio, slenderness and <b>corner</b> <b>stiffness</b> on the shear lag effect and other structural aspects. It answers these questions by changing the parameters of a basic structure in the Finite Element Method (FEM) program AxisVM. This structure has a floor plan of 14. 4 m x 14. 4 m and has 25 floors with a 3. 5 m floor height, adding up to a total height of 87. 5 m and a slenderness just over 6. All models are made in 4 different configurations: a cast-in-place configuration, a prefabricated configuration with a masonry configuration for the elements and two similar prefabricated configurations with small and large windows. Two parameters are also formulated in this section {{to keep track of the}} shear lag effect: These are the shear lag factor P, for flange walls and the shear lag factor P* for web walls. All these previously mentioned characteristics, except for the floor plan, are used for the answering of the research question on non-rectangular structures. The conclusions from this part of the parameter research are that the changes in shear lag effect are small if inside corners or corners with an angle not being 90 degrees are used. For structures with the floor plan of higher polygons, such as octagons and hexadecagons improved structural behavior was found. The reduction in peak stresses in the corners can be attributed to the shorter elements where shear lag can form and the more corners over which the peak stresses can be divided. For the parameters researched using the square floor plan it was found that both the aspect ratio (the ratio between width and depth of the structure) and the introduction of structural vertical joints between the elements in masonry configuration had no to a negligible influence on the structural behavior. The effect of the <b>corner</b> <b>stiffness</b> on the structural behavior was more profound: especially reducing the <b>corner</b> <b>stiffness</b> has a noticeable negative effect on co-operation between the flange and webs walls, which in turn increases the deflection at the top of the structure. For the relation between the shear lag and the slenderness of the structure it was found that structures with a lower slenderness, that depend more on their shear stiffness to resist lateral loading, experience more shear lag than structures with a higher slenderness. In the second part the following research question was answered: “Is it possible to build a structurally feasible prefabricated tube-in-tube high-rise structure in the confines of the Dutch building market of approximately 200 m high and how does it compare to other prefabricated solutions?” In the literature report a building was described that could be used to answer both parts of this research question. The Zalmhaventoren is a proposed residential shear wall high-rise structure in Rotterdam which has been researched by ten Hagen for a Master's thesis at Delft University of Technology. In this thesis, the original cast in-situ concrete Zalmhaventoren is redesigned to a prefabricated shear wall structure that is 201. 3 m high. A redesign of this structure gives insight in the possibilities of a fully prefabricated concrete structure and has a model that as comparable to the model researched by ten Hagen. During the redesign the basic dimensions of the original structure were kept. The floor plan of the structure is 30 m x 29. 5 m, has a core of 14. 4 m x 12 m and the floor to floor height is 3. 05 m. Although originally designed as a residential structure, this floor height is also sufficient for other functions, such as an office function. To keep the structure comparable to the one designed by ten Hagen, 66 floors were used to reach the total height of 201. 3 m. Besides these basic dimensions however, significant changes were made to convert the structure into a prefabricated tube-in-tube structure. The removal of the shear walls and addition of the lateral load resisting façades changed the floor plan of the structure. To give the tube the stiffness that is required when loaded by wind, extra material was added in the corners of the structure, where windows were present in the shear wall design. Also an extra column was added in the center of the frame for the largest balcony on each side of the structure. In the lobby of the structure similar changes were made to fit the new structural system of the building. Another important part of the structural design was the determination of the stiffnesses of the different connections between the elements. Especially for the horizontal connections in the tube of the structure this proved difficult, because of the differences in normal stress between different parts in the same element. A 2 -level stepped stiffness was given to these tube elements to approximate the actual stiffnesses in this type of connections. For the corner connections (of the Interlocking Halfway Connection type) the stiffness was determined for the connection in compression and in tension. An iterative calculation ensured that the correct stiffness was attributed to the correct corner connection. After the model was made, the results were analyzed. Probably the most important result, for it is often governing in high-rise structures, is the deflection at the top of the structure. For a structure of this height, the maximum allowable deflection is 403 mm. For the four different wind directions, the deflection was between 282 mm and 327 mm. Also the shear stress between elements was checked and found to be within the limits set in the Eurocode. For two elements an estimation of the reinforcement was made. The reinforcement of the lintel was viable, but for the column near the lobby of the structure, a reinforcement percentage was found that was higher than the recommended maximum value in the Eurocode. However, if the integrity of the concrete can be assured or the less strict Dutch national annex is used, the found percentage does not interfere with the feasibility of the structure Along with the main model, some alternate models were made to research the effect of certain aspects on the most important result: the top deflection of the tower. The first one was the difference between a cast-in-place model and the prefabricated one. The increase in top deflection for the prefabricated structure was around 8 %. Not negligible, but not high enough to stop considering prefabricated tube-in-tube structures from being viable. The second check was if removing the balconies, and with them the less stiff frames around the balconies, and replacing them with ordinary stiffer windows had a positive effect on the top deflection. It was found that implementing this change at the same element thickness reduced the top deflection by 34 % to 42 %. Even when the thickness of all the elements was reduced from 400 mm to 300 mm, the top deflection of a structure without the balconies was better than for the model with balconies and a element thickness of 400 mm. In the comparison with the structure from the work of ten Hagen, it became clear that both lateral stability resisting systems could work for the Zalmhaventoren. Both had advantages and disadvantages that could be weighted either way by different developers if the structure was designed purely as a residential building. However, if the tower was designed as being a multipurpose building, the open floor plan of the tube-in-tube structure provides not only more flexibility at completion, but especially over the entire lifetime of the structure. Ultimately this research gives insight into the structural behavior of the prefabricated tube-in-tube structure and proved that the possibilities of the prefabricated tube-in-tube structure lie even beyond the 200 m, especially if the technologies associated with this stability system keep improving over the coming years.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a process for}} the estimation of tire-road forces, vehicle sideslip angle and wheel <b>cornering</b> <b>stiffness.</b> The method uses measurements (yaw rate, longi- tudinal/lateral accelerations, steering angle and angular wheel velocities) only from sensors which can be integrated or have already been integrated in modern cars. The estimation process is based on two blocks in series: the first block contains a sliding-mode observer whose principal role is to calculate tire-road forces, while in the second block an extended Kalman filter estimates sideslip angle and cor- nering stiffness. More specifically, this study proposes an adaptive tire-force model that takes variations in road friction into account. The paper also {{presents a}} study of convergence for the sliding-mode observer. The estimation process was applied and compared to real experimental data, in particular wheel force measurements. Experimental results show the accuracy and potential of the estimation process. Vehicle dynamics, Tire-road force, Sideslip angle, <b>Cornering</b> <b>stiffness,</b> Sliding-mode observe...|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} used vehicle stability algorithms {{primary use}} yaw rate and lateral acceleration as reference signals while ve-hicle state could {{be defined by}} yaw rate and vehicle sideslip an-gle. Furthermore onboard later acceleration measurement is overlayed with significant disturbances. Approximate enough vehicle sideslip estimation ensures the opportunity of correct vehicle state observation and deducing other important vehi-cle parameters as corrected lateral acceleration for instance. By using this additional information new vehicle state defini-tions and interventions are realizable. The front and rear axles’ <b>cornering</b> <b>stiffness</b> coefficients could be estimated from the vehi-cle sideslip angle – after some filtering these signals can show which wheels could be braked. Or new reference models could be set up – these models will be adaptive, not like the currently used empirically defined models. Adaptive means that it consid-ers adhesion coefficients, tyre characteristics and vehicle load {{at the same time}} – not as the recently used systems. Predicted vehicle state definition could also be done, which is able to show dangers before they start to develop.

30|$|Chang (2010 b) pseudo-dynamically tested two RC bridge columns at 2 / 5 reduced scale, and one {{identical}} {{column was}} also tested under biaxial cyclic horizontal load with constant axial load. The {{results showed that}} the distinct characteristics of biaxial hysteretic loops are rounded at <b>corners</b> and negative <b>stiffness</b> values. In addition, scatter plots of pseudo-dynamic results reveal that there is no bias in the orientations of the resultant flexural moments. Therefore, it seems appropriate to make a seismic design based on biaxial bending without bias in any specific direction. The complicated biaxial hysteretic loops confirm the difficulty of developing suitable load-displacement models for non-linear dynamic analysis. These pseudo-dynamic outputs, such as displacement and hysteretic responses, can be treated as references for analytical models proposed to simulate the load-displacement relationship. After comparing biaxial with uniaxial hysteretic loops for both cyclic loading and pseudo-dynamic tests, {{it is important to note}} that biaxial hysteretic loops show greater stiffness degradation and pinching during unloading. This reveals that damage caused in one direction weakens the seismic resistance in the other direction.|$|R

40|$|International audienceLots of {{satisfactory}} results of high-precision lateral control {{have been reported}} {{with the assumption that}} vehicles move without sliding. But this assumption never comes true under real working conditions. More and more anti-sliding controllers have been designed which heavily relied on sophisticated control laws. Although the previous works can actually improve the guidance accuracy, the complexity and the rigorous requirements for the controller abilities make such controllers not very realistic for actual applications. In this paper a kinematic model is built which takes sliding effects into account by introducing two additional tire sliding angles. Based on this model an anti-sliding controller is designed. But unfortunately its efficiency completely depends on the estimation of the sliding parameters which cannot be directly measured by sensors. To overcome this problem an adaptive observer is designed using Lyapunov methods. With this observer, the <b>cornering</b> <b>stiffness</b> parameters instead of the sliding angles are estimated. The Lyapunov stability theory guarantees that the estimated value of the <b>cornering</b> <b>stiffness</b> would converge to its real value when the persistent excitation (PE) condition is satisfied. Consequently the sliding angles are reconstructed precisely. Simulation and experimental results show that the sliding effects can be compensated effectively by the combination of the anti sliding controller and the sliding angle reconstruction...|$|E
