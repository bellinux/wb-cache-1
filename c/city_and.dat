40|$|Nowadays <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> {{regions are}} "engines of {{economic}} development", with many environmental challenges to face. Today, {{may be more}} than ever, {{there is a need for}} competitiveness of <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> regions, and this cannot be achieved without taking into account the global dimension of the environmental problems. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the issue of promoting renewable energy, as a possible local solution to global environmental problems of competitive <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> regions. First, some global environmental problems and success factors of competitive <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> regions are revealed, and second, some measures and actions for promoting renewable energy in Romania's development regions are suggested. The findings of this study reveal that renewable energy plays a major role among the success factors of competitive <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> regions, which may be encouraged to become sustainable, green <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> regions. In addition, the study has revealed that there is a need for a strong partnership between the local stakeholders in order to develop competitive green <b>cities,</b> <b>and</b> also for actions or programs that may promote and/or support the use of renewable energy for the development of <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> regions in Romania. The results of this study may be used for upcoming research in the area of implementing renewable energy projects for the development of competitive <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> regions in a world of globalization...|$|R

40|$|Research on {{development}} situation of spatial structure of <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> towns' economy in China's old industrial base is {{the incarnation of}} important thought about completely building relatively prosperous society and implementing ”three representatives”, is the new breakthrough of solving the issue on countryside, agriculture and farmer, and is the needs of stabilizing political power in basic level and sustainable development. The spatial structure of <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> towns is product of <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> towns' forming, developing and interaction under certain social and economical development level. In terms of the regional level of city, the spatial structure of <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> towns has two forms, which are external spatial structure and internal spatial structure. The former one is to study the spatial position of <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> towns with regional background and to reflect the spatial clustering scale of interaction ralationship among <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> towns; the latter one is to explore the physical features of <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> towns and the proportion relationship, function ties and spatial composition among all the parts of cities {{on the basis of}} city-level. This paper takes close analysis on the development situation of Liaoning's <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> towns' economy in China's old industrial base from the perspective of external spatial structure, then dissects the major problems and causes of its existence, finally puts forward with solutions and suggestions on speeding up spatial structure development of Liaoning's <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> towns' economy...|$|R

40|$|For {{more than}} 50 years, suburbs {{throughout}} the United States have prospered, {{while many of}} the large cities they surround have stagnated. Hence, many people perceive that <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> suburbs tend to grow at each other’s expense—and thus compete for residents and jobs. While there is some truth in this perception, it misses the fact that a metro area’s <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> suburbs also depend on each other for economic growth. <b>Cities</b> <b>and</b> their suburbs share a multitude of resources, such as airports, highways, mass transit, cultural amenities, entertainment venues, air quality, potential employers, and many more. These shared resources may be even more important than the differences between <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> suburbs in determining where people live and jobs locate. Rappaport examines the main forces that have influenced the growth of <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> suburbs over the past century. He finds that, while <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> suburbs do sometimes grow at each other’s expense, more often they grow or decline together. Thus, while it may make sense for <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> their suburbs to compete along some dimensions, there are also strong incentives for the two to cooperate to make their metro areas attractive and productive places to live <b>and</b> work. <b>Cities</b> <b>and</b> towns...|$|R
