500|$|Initially, {{the song}} [...] "Everyone's at It" [...] was {{announced}} {{to be released}} as the lead single from the album, but it was ultimately decided on [...] "The Fear". While discussing It's Not Me, It's You, Allen stated that her intention was to make [...] "bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs. [...] I think I've grown up a bit {{as a person and}} I hope it reflects that." [...] She released a demo version of the song, which was then called [...] "I Don't Know", onto her Myspace account, along with another song, [...] "I Could Say", in April 2008. The singer declared about the inspiration for the song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: [...] tell you where the inspiration for it came from. I was walking down this street, in this village {{in the middle of the}} countryside in the U.K., and there was this little girl who must have been eight or nine, walking down the street with her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. And I just thought, 'That's not really right.' And I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> was the kind of girl that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that where I come from, and it's not necessarily a culture that I think is particularly healthy. But at the same time, I'm very aware that I am a part of that culture â€“ but it's not something that I feel particularly comfortable with.|$|E
60|$|Miss Sampson {{had been}} {{standing}} in her door. I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> had heard; she looked agitated. I knew she {{had been talking to}} her father.|$|E
60|$|By {{her tone}} he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> {{wanted to have}} him in the boat to herself, {{and that she was}} subtly gratified that she should have power over them both. He gave himself, in a strange, {{electric}} submission.|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> him <b>she's</b> a bad hard girl--one who'd poison {{any good}} man's life!" [...] my {{companion}} broke {{out with a}} passion that startled me.|$|R
6000|$|No one <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> whether <b>she</b> {{knew that}} she was dying, except perhaps for those words, [...] "Take care of Polly," [...] and the gift of the ring.|$|R
6000|$|... "You men!" [...] said Lady Marayne after {{a little}} pause. [...] "What queer beasts you are! Here {{is a woman who}} is kind to you. She's fond of you. I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>she's</b> fond of you {{directly}} I heard her. And you amuse yourself with her. And then it's Gobble, Gobble, Gobble, Great Work, Hands Clear, Big Business of the World. Why couldn't you think of that before, Poff? Why did you begin with her?" ...|$|R
60|$|Dick warmly spoke his gratefulness, and, inexpressibly {{relieved}} and happy for Mercedes, he went toward the clump of cactus {{where he had}} left her. She stood erect, waiting, and, dark as it was, he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> had lost the terror that had so shaken her.|$|E
60|$|An {{account of}} the concert was {{immediately}} claimed; and Anne's recollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features and make her rejoice to talk of it. All that she <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> told most gladly, but the all was little for one who had been there, and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith, who had already heard, through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter, rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than Anne could relate, and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the company. Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath was well know by name to Mrs Smith.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{woman in}} the secret of this conspiracy, though how she {{obtained}} a knowledge of it no one seemed to know. Her name was Epicharis. While the execution of the plans of the confederates was delayed, Epicharis came to the principal conspirators privately, first to one and then to another, and urged them to action. None {{of the members of the}} plot would admit that they had given her any information on the subject, and how she obtained her information no one <b>could</b> <b>tell.</b> <b>She</b> {{was a woman}} of bad character, and as such women often are, she was violent and implacable in her hatred. She hated Nero, and was so impatient at the delay of the conspirators that she made repeated and earnest efforts to urge them on.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} the woman is insane or ignorant. I wish I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> whether <b>she</b> {{was trying to make}} me angry for the benefit of those horrid unshaven men, or merely for her private edification." ...|$|R
60|$|When the Old Lady {{had found}} out {{everything}} Crooked Jack <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> her, <b>she</b> {{went into the house}} and sat down by the window of her little sitting-room to think it all over. She was tingling from head to foot with excitement.|$|R
60|$|The {{examination}} was over, though I doubted if the Coroner {{was entirely}} satisfied with it. I think {{he suspected that}} Mary Cavendish <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> more if <b>she</b> chose.|$|R
60|$|As for Rosek, {{she treated}} {{him as if}} that little scene had never taken place. The idea of {{appealing}} to her husband in a difficulty was gone for ever since the night he came home drunk. And she did not dare to tell her father. He would--what would he not do? But she was always on her guard, knowing that Rosek would not forgive her for that dart of ridicule. His insinuations about Daphne Wing she put out of mind, as she never could have if she had loved Fiorsen. She set up for herself the idol of pride, and became its faithful worshipper. Only Winton, and perhaps Betty, <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> was not happy. Fiorsen's debts and irresponsibility about money did not worry her much, for she paid everything in the house--rent, wages, food, and her own dress--and had so far made ends meet; {{and what he did}} outside the house she could not help.|$|E
60|$|Poor Mrs. Winterfield! She {{had been}} strong in her youth, and had herself sat through evening lectures with a fortitude which other people cannot attain. And she was strong too in her age, with the {{strength}} of a martyr, submitting herself with patience to wearinesses which are insupportable to those who have none of the martyr spirit. The sermons of Perivale were neither bright, nor eloquent, nor encouraging. All the old vicar or the young curate <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> had heard hundreds of times. She knew it all by heart, and could have preached their sermons to them better than they could preach them to her. It was impossible that she could learn anything from them; and yet she would sit there thrice a day, suffering from cold in winter, from cough in spring, from heat in summer, and from rheumatism in autumn; and now that her doctor had forbidden her to go more than twice, recommending her to go only once, she really thought that she regarded the prohibition as a grievance. Indeed, to such as her, that expectation of the jewelled causeway, and of the perfect pavement that shall never be worn, must be everything. But if she was right,--right as to herself and others,--then why has the world been made so pleasant? Why is the fruit of the earth so sweet; and the trees,--why are they so green; and the mountains so full of glory? Why are women so lovely? and {{why is it that the}} activity of man's mind is the only sure forerunner of man's progress? In listening thrice a day to outpourings from the clergymen at Perivale, there certainly was no activity of mind.|$|E
6000|$|But soon I {{found that}} there was good in her too. She used {{sometimes}} to give me pennies, so that once I had four in my pocket all at the same time; but the best part of her was the stories that she <b>could</b> <b>tell.</b> <b>She</b> was sore frightened of frogs, so I would bring one to her, and tell her that I would put it down her neck unless she told a story. That always helped her to begin; but when once she was started it was wonderful how she would carry on. And the things that had happened to her, they were enough to take your breath away. There was a Barbary rover that had been at Eyemouth, and he was coming back in five years in a ship full of gold to make her his wife; {{and then there was a}} wandering knight who had been there also, and he had given her a ring which he said he would redeem when the time came. She showed me the ring, which was very like the ones upon my bed curtain; but she said that this one was virgin gold. I asked her what the knight would do if he met the Barbary rover, and she told me that he would sweep his head from his shoulders. [...] What they could all see in her was more than I could think. And then she told me that she had been followed on her way to West Inch by a disguised prince. I asked her how she knew it was a prince, and she said by his disguise. Another day she said that her father was preparing a riddle, and that when it was ready it would be put in the papers, and anyone who guessed it would have half his fortune and his daughter. I said that I was good at riddles, and that she must send it to me when it was ready. She said it would be in the Berwick Gazette, and wanted to know what I would do with her when I won her. I said I would sell her by public roup for what she would fetch; but she would tell no more stories that evening, for she was very techy about some things.|$|E
60|$|She laughed softly. She {{was looking}} full {{into his eyes}} and yet he <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> whether <b>she</b> was angry with him or only amused.|$|R
6000|$|... "You haven't {{thought it}} worth while {{to ask for}} a dance yet," [...] she remarked, and Foster <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> if <b>she</b> was {{offended}} or not.|$|R
60|$|Dick {{was tall}} and pale and {{looked as if he}} had heaps of brains. He had thick curly brown hair and big dark blue eyes--Jill said his eyes were like an archangel's, but how <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell?</b> <b>She</b> never saw an archangel. I liked his nose. It was so {{straight}} and finished-looking. Mr. Grinnell had the worst-looking nose you ever saw. Jill and I used to make poetry about it in church to keep from falling asleep when he preached such awful long sermons.|$|R
6000|$|Soames nodded. He {{had never}} seen her look prettier, yet he could not rid himself of the {{impression}} that this business was unnatural--remembering still that crushed figure burrowing into the corner of the sofa. From that night to this day he had received from her no confidences. He knew from his chauffeur that she had made one more attempt on Robin Hill and drawn blank--an empty house, no one at home. He knew that she had received a letter, but not what was in it, except that it had made her hide herself and cry. He had remarked that she looked at him sometimes when she thought he wasn't noticing, as if she were wondering still what he had done--forsooth--to make those people hate him so. Well, there it was! Annette had come back, and things had worn on through the summer--very miserable, till suddenly Fleur had {{said she was going to}} marry young Mont. She had shown him a little more affection when she told him that. And he had yielded--what was the good of opposing it? God knew that he had never wished to thwart her in anything! And the young man seemed quite delirious about her. No doubt she was in a reckless mood, and she was young, absurdly young. But if he opposed her, he didn't know what she would do; for all he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> might want to take up a profession, become a doctor or solicitor, some nonsense. She had no aptitude for painting, writing, music, in his view the legitimate occupations of unmarried women, if they must do something in these days. On the whole, she was safer married, for he could see too well how feverish and restless she was at home. Annette, too, had been in favour of it--Annette, from behind the veil of his refusal to know what she was about, if she was about anything. Annette had said: [...] "Let her marry this young man. He is a nice boy--not so highty-flighty as he seems." [...] Where she got her expressions, he didn't know--but her opinion soothed his doubts. His wife, whatever her conduct, had clear eyes and an almost depressing amount of common sense. He had settled fifty thousand on Fleur, taking care that there was no cross settlement in case it didn't turn out well. Could it turn out well? She had not got over that other boy--he knew. They were to go to Spain for the honeymoon. He would be even lonelier when she was gone. But later, perhaps, she would forget, and turn to him again! Winifred's voice broke on his reverie.|$|E

5000|$|Tom Tiddler's Ground is {{also used}} in modern English as a {{euphemism}} for having an uncertain status, for example, [...] "I asked her why her performance review was late and I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> was on Tom Tiddler's Ground".|$|E

50|$|The {{department}} heads {{were filled with}} local stars from Chicagoâ€™s independent filmmaking scene. Tari Segal was hired to shoot the film. She had just wrapped shooting Phedon Popamichael's feature film, Lost Angeles, whom she had interned {{for a few years}} earlier on the film he was shooting, Sideways, while she was still attending Columbia College Chicago. Adri Siriwatt was hired as the production designer. Adri came in for the interview covered in paint from a production that she was working on and the producers <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> wasn't afraid to do whatever it took to get the job done, even if it meant getting her hands dirty. Aly Barohn was hired as the costume designer. The producers' first meeting with Aly was very similar: she had a quirky style and impressive knowledge of current fashion trends that were going on in Venice Beach and Hollywood out on the West Coast, {{all the way to the}} Midwest styles that were dominating every age group in the city of Chicago.|$|E
