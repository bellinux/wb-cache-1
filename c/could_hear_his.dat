25|$|Traficant {{championed the}} unpopular cause of John Demjanjuk, a Ukrainian-born autoworker from Seven Hills, {{who had been}} convicted in Israel and sentenced to hang for having been the brutal {{concentration}} camp guard Ivan the Terrible For almost a decade, Traficant (along with Pat Buchanan) insisted that Demjanjuk had been denied a fair trial, and {{been the victim of}} mistaken identity; in 1993 the Supreme Court of Israel overturned the conviction, on the basis of doubt. Demjanjuk was later deported to Germany on May 11, 2009, after the Supreme Court of the United States refused to overturn his deportation order. Demjanjuk was tried and convicted by a German criminal court of being an accessory to murder, but died before the German Appellate Court <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> case, thereby voiding the conviction.|$|E
500|$|The trip to America is approaching. [...] {{is not yet}} complete. Terrible haste... {{the score}} is only half-ready. The copyist, Mr. Kauppi, is staying with us and writing night and day... It is only because of Janne's [...] energy that we are making progress... We lit a lamp in the dining room, a {{chandelier}} in the living room, it was a festive moment. I didn't dare say a word. I just checked that the environment was in order. Then I went to bed and Janne stayed up. All night long I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> footsteps, alternating with music played quietly.|$|E
2500|$|Caillat, in contrast, cites Fleetwood as [...] "still one of {{the most}} amazing drummers I've ever met. He had his rack of tom drums {{arranged}} back to front. Most drummers place them from high to low (in pitch) from their left to right, but Mick chose to place his mid, high, low. I think perhaps this helped him develop his unique style. He hit his drums very hard, except for his kick drum. For some reason, when he played his high hat, it distracted him. He would keep perfect beat with his kick, but he played it so softly that we <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> mouth noises through his kick mic." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{turn to look}} at 'im," [...] he said bluntly. [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>'ear</b> <b>'is</b> voice plain enough--so {{why should}} I take a look at 'im? 'Ow did I know there was a goin' to be murder done in my cab, and me wanted to say what the murderer looked like?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They've gone!" [...] the man replied, and we <b>could</b> now <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> words more {{distinctly}} {{because he}} was coming nearer each instant.|$|R
60|$|There was a nasty leer {{upon his}} face as he stepped close to her and spoke again. I <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> words, but her answer came clearly.|$|R
60|$|Still Silver was unconquered. I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> teeth rattle in his head, {{but he had}} not yet surrendered.|$|E
60|$|She <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> slow {{retreating}} footsteps, {{and something}} in the rhythm of them threw her into a passion of weeping.|$|E
60|$|She {{kissed him}} passionately, and ran lightly upstairs. In the hall below she <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> firm voice giving quick {{commands}} to the servants.|$|E
6000|$|IDONEA [...] Oh, <b>could</b> you <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> voice! [...] I {{will not}} call on Heaven to vouch for me, [...] But let this kiss speak {{what is in}} my heart.|$|R
6000|$|The {{voice of}} the Man of the Mountains who {{answered}} them was so high and weak Nod <b>could</b> scarcely <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> whisper. [...] "There is no way over," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now the Dead One's voice {{seemed to}} grow ever fainter and more hollow as he spoke, till at the last I <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> words, yet I answered him, asking him this:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Keo {{went away}} in good spirits, and they <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> {{laughing}} [...] "guk-uk-uk-uk!" [...] {{long after he}} was lost in sight in the jungle.|$|E
6000|$|... [58] I saw him lie and harken [...] To {{the little}} songs she sung, [...] And when the shadows darken [...] I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> lisping tongue.|$|E
60|$|In another {{instant he}} had awakened the {{remainder}} of the party by shouting vigorously, as if believing it possible that those on board <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> voice.|$|E
60|$|Her voice {{died away}} in sadness, {{and in the}} silence she <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> Billy grit <b>his</b> teeth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Cap'n Eb says {{in all his}} born days {{he never}} hearn such screeches and yells as the wind give over that chimbley; and old Cack got so frightened, you <b>could</b> fairly <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> teeth chatter.|$|R
2500|$|By {{careful and}} {{persistent}} experimentation, Esseintes learned to [...] "execute {{on his tongue}} a succession of voiceless melodies; noiseless funeral marches, solemn and stately; <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> in <b>his</b> mouth solos of cr√®me de menthe, duets of vespertro and rum." ...|$|R
60|$|Presently a {{group of}} troopers hid him entirely from her view, but she <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> thin, smooth voice quite clearly as he called to citizen Heron.|$|E
60|$|Saying this, he {{plunged into}} the thick {{underbrush}} and soon disappeared, although they <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> great body crashing through the bushes until he was far distant.|$|E
6000|$|... "I left it," [...] he said, {{his voice}} glumping as he spoke. [...] "Need I tell you why?" [...] He had come nearer to her. She <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> pants as he moved.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} the dead man with pale, grim eyes. Out in the hallway the doctor's voice further {{increased}} her despair. He {{was talking to the}} police on the telephone, and she <b>could</b> distinctly <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> every word.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Deronda!" [...] The girls <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> this {{exclamation from}} their mamma. Mab clasped her hands, {{saying in a}} loud whisper, [...] "There now! {{something}} is going to happen." [...] Kate and Amy gave up their work in amazement. But Deronda's tone in reply was so low that they <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> words, and Mrs. Meyrick immediately closed the parlor door.|$|R
60|$|To Mike {{it seemed}} as if {{everything}} in the world was standing still and waiting. He <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> nothing but <b>his</b> own breathing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's Mr. Pip, aged parent," [...] said Wemmick, [...] "and I {{wish you}} <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> name. Nod away at him, Mr. Pip; that's what he likes. Nod away at him, if you please, like winking!" ...|$|E
60|$|She sat down, {{tried to}} read the paper, tried to put Phil out of her mind. But he kept returning. She fancied that she <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> voice in the hall. She dropped the paper to listen.|$|E
6000|$|On {{entering}} the club one afternoon I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> voice bawling vociferously {{in one of}} the telephone cabinets in the hall. [...] "Hello, Washington," [...] he was shouting. [...] "Is that Washington? Long Distance, I want Washington." ...|$|E
6000|$|Fritz {{dropped his}} voice {{so that the}} clerks in the room <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> reply. [...] "Minna has sent me to you," [...] he answered. [...] "She is uneasy about her mother. I can make nothing of it--and she wants to ask your advice." ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{went back}} to where the others were standing, talking in undertones: and one said--Sue <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> which--"She's <b>his</b> wife, I suppose?" ...|$|R
60|$|Again the {{withered}} aged man interposed, evidently in {{the character}} of a peacemaker. Hadden <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> talk, but he rose and pointed towards the sea, while from his expressive gestures and sorrowful mien, he seemed to be prophesying disaster should a certain course of action be followed.|$|R
60|$|The two had halted at {{a little}} wooden gate which led into the strip of field {{dividing}} the two plantations. Rochester was looking back along the footpath by which they had come. They <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> voice distinctly.|$|E
60|$|He {{sat down}} upon the sand, limp. Seen thus, he somehow seemed {{to be quite a}} small man, not a cave man at all. His {{goatskin}} suit shrunk in on him. I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> pants as he sat.|$|E
60|$|Silently {{he stole}} {{to the foot}} of the attic stairs and then paused to listen. The house seemed very quiet, but he <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> mother's voice softly humming a cradle-song that she had sung to him when he was a baby.|$|E
60|$|Oh, {{you don't}} know. Last Tuesday he was dining there, {{and you should}} have seen the state he was in. He was so restless he couldn't sit still. He looked at his watch every minute. His eyes simply glittered with excitement, and I <b>could</b> almost <b>hear</b> <b>his</b> heart beating.|$|R
60|$|He {{raised her}} fingers to his lips--tenderly--with the grace of a prince, but all the affection of a lover. What {{he said to her}} none <b>could</b> <b>hear,</b> for <b>his</b> voice was lowered almost to a whisper. But the colour stained her cheeks, and her blush was the blush of a girl.|$|R
60|$|His voice died away, and the {{arm that}} was round my neck went limp, and I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> by <b>his</b> {{breathing}} {{that he was}} asleep. His head was resting on my back, but I didn't move. I wriggled {{a little closer to}} make him as comfortable as I could, and then I went to sleep myself.|$|R
