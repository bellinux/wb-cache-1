40|$|At {{the heart}} of the dispute on EC-IT Products 1 is the {{definition}} of information-technology (IT) products and {{the question of how to}} treat increasingly multifunctional high-tech goods. The dispute was triggered by various measures introduced by the European Union, resulting in the imposition of duties of up to 14 % pertaining to the tariff treatment of certain multifunctional IT products. The <b>complaining</b> <b>parties</b> (the United States, along with Japan and Taiwan) argued that, by introducing these duties, the EU had violated the 1996 Information Technology Agreement (ITA). The WTO Panel Report, circulated on 16 August 2010, ruled in favor of the <b>complaining</b> <b>parties,</b> and ordered the EU to repeal the measures leading to the dutiable treatment of the products at stake. We argue that the Panel's ruling enhances the credibility of trade-policy liberalization in the high-tech sector, fostering the development of new technologies. © Copyright Paola Conconi and Robert Howse 2012.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} the new European Union (EU) regulations {{in the light}} of the ruling by the World Trade Organization (WTO) panel on the trade in genetically modified crops. To this end, we describe: the basic differences in approaches between the EU and the <b>complaining</b> <b>parties</b> with regard to genetically modified crops, what the main arguments were of the <b>complaining</b> <b>parties</b> as well as the defence of the EU, what the final judgement of the panel was and finally, we describe the current EU regulations. We then analyse to what extent, the arguments and conclusions of the panel still hold regarding the new EU legislation. We find that parts of the current EU legislation, that is, the safety bans as they are currently in place, are in breach of the WTO commitments. Moreover, the new approval procedures have the potential to also break these rules, although whether or not they will, depends on how the European Commission acts. Whether or not the EU will be challenged at the WTO remains an open question, as the decision to fight before the WTO may be more costly than working out new bilateral trade agreements. </p...|$|R

6000|$|In the {{correspondence}} between the Governor of New York and myself last summer, I understood him to complain that the enrolments {{in several of the}} districts of that State had been neither accurately nor honestly made; and in view of this, I, for the draft then immediately ensuing, ordered an arbitrary reduction of the quotas in several of the districts wherein they seemed too large, and said: [...] "After this drawing, these four districts, and also the seventeenth and twenty-ninth, shall be carefully re-enrolled, and, if you please, agents of yours may witness every step of the process." [...] In a subsequent letter I believe some additional districts were put into the list of those to be re-enrolled. My idea was to do the work over according to the law, in presence of the <b>complaining</b> <b>party,</b> and thereby to correct anything which might be found amiss. The commission, whose work I am considering, seem to have proceeded upon a totally different idea. Not going forth to find men at all, they have proceeded altogether upon paper examinations and mental processes. One of their conclusions, as I understand, is that, as the law stands, and attempting to follow it, the enrolling officers could not have made the enrolments much more accurately than they did. The report on this point might be useful to Congress. The commission conclude that the quotas for the draft should be based upon entire population, and they proceed upon this basis to give a table for the State of New York, in which some districts are reduced and some increased. For the now ensuing draft, let the quotas stand as made by the enrolling officers, in the districts wherein this table requires them to be increased; and let them be reduced according to the table in the others: this to be no precedent for subsequent action. But, as I think this report may, on full consideration, be shown to have much that is valuable in it, I suggest that such consideration be given it, and that it be especially considered whether its suggestions can be conformed to without an alteration of the law.|$|E

50|$|Sanctions, in law {{and legal}} definition, are {{penalties}} or other means of enforcement used to provide incentives for obedience with the law, or with rules and regulations.

Within the civil law context, sanctions are usually monetary fines, levied against a party to a lawsuit or his/her attorney, for violating rules of procedure, or for abusing the judicial process. The most severe sanction in a civil lawsuit is the involuntary dismissal, with prejudice, of a <b>complaining</b> <b>party's</b> cause of action, or of the responding party's answer. This has the effect of deciding the entire action against the sanctioned party without recourse, except to the degree that an appeal or trial de novo may be allowed because of reversible error.|$|R

40|$|WTO dispute {{settlement}} procedures have been praised for their effectiveness, but recently {{there have been}} significant examples of Members failing to observe, or delaying implementation of, rulings and recommendations issued by the Dispute Settlement Bodies to rectify violations of the WTO Agreement. This issue has arisen particularly {{in cases where the}} U. S. has been challenged its "law as such" violations, in other words cases claiming that a country's domestic law or regulation in itself constitutes a violation of the WTO Agreement. These cases include those won by Japan against the U. S., and this implementation problem is becoming a pressing trade policy issue. Given special-interest politics and the "sectionalism" of the compartmentalized committee system in the U. S. Congress, it is desirable that procedures to ensure compliance be structured to encourage the Congress to promptly implement rulings by the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB). However, the current DSU (Dispute Settlement Understanding) and its operation in cases involving "law as such" are not necessarily conducive to this goal. First, when a reasonable period of time (RPT) for compliance is determined, the <b>complained</b> <b>party</b> is allowed a broad degree of discretion in selecting the measure to comply with the recommendation, and there is no guarantee of the shortest possible RPT enabling appropriate implementation. Second, while financial compensation imposes a broad-based fiscal burden on the concerned citizens of the <b>complained</b> <b>party,</b> continuation of the violation benefits special interest groups and circumvents pressure to comply with the DSB ruling. Third, under existing practice, the level of nullification or impairment for determining suspensions of concessions (countermeasures) is calculated on the basis of actual trade loss created by the violation in question, excluding the chilling effects on trade. In the few examples where the rules on contravention of the WTO agreement have been applied, the suspension of concessions allowed has not been sufficient to cover this loss. It would be possible to partially resolve some of these issues by making some changes to the interpretation or application of the existing rules, but the agreement needs to be amended, particularly regarding the calculation of the level of suspension of concessions. However, this issue has not been dealt with adequately in the proposals submitted to the DSU negotiations in the Doha Round. ...|$|R
