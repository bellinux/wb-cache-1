40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of adding condensed tannins in the form of non-purified (Liposterine®) or purified (Exxenterol®) extracts obtained from Carob fruit to prevent lipid <b>cooked</b> <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> systems from oxidising during chilling and frozen storage. The antioxidant activity of these extracts was compared with that of α-tocopherol. Meat lipid alteration was evaluated as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances content (TBARS) and polar material-related triglyceride compounds followed by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). TBARS levels were lower (P 0. 05) for LM and EM but lower (P < 0. 05) than for TM. Polar material increased several times in all samples, but significantly less in TM and EM than in LM. Thermal oxidation compounds determined by HPSEC were lower (P < 0. 05) in EM than in LM or TM. The changes in polar material were proportionally smaller after six months frozen storage than after chilled storage, with Exxenterol displaying the highest antioxidant protection. Therefore Carob fruit extracts can be successfully used to reduce fat alteration in <b>cooked</b> <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> at chilled and frozen temperatures. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The properties of injected and tumbled meat {{were determined by}} measuring processing characteristics (tumblingyield, cooked yield, expressed moisture), color and textural characteristics (shear force, texture profile analysis). The increase of the tumbling time up to 9 hours favorably affected hydration properties and increased the cooked yield. It also decreased the shear force and hardness of the samples.

There are also vegetarian options, often with ayote (a type of squash) or garlic. Some adventurous restaurants even offer pupusas stuffed with shrimp or spinach which are served with salsa roja, a simple yet flavorful Salvadoran cooked tomato sauce, often served with curtido. Pollo encebollado is another popular Salvadoran dish that contains chicken simmered with onions. Salvadoran cheeses, queso duro (hard cheese), queso fresco (fresh cheese), and cuajada, are eaten with meals.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{report the}} case of a 42 -year-old woman who was {{admitted}} to the hospital for fever, chills, nausea, vom-iting, fatigue, myalgia, and general muscle weakness. All these symptoms had occurred 3 weeks after the ingestion of inadequately <b>cooked</b> <b>pork</b> <b>meat,</b> subsequently confirmed to be infested with Trichinella spiralis. Laboratory results showed mild leukocytosis, inflammation, and mild liver and muscle cytolytic syndrome, all suggestive of trichinellosis. Echocardiography showed apical hypokinesis and an apical mass (likely a thrombus). The immunologic assessment for the presence of Trichinella antigens was positive. The outcome was favorable after treatment with an anticoagulant, an antiaggregant, prednisone, and mebendazole. Follow-up controls showed the absence of any symptoms and thrombus, with only mild electrocardiogram modifications still present...|$|R
40|$|This work {{focused on}} Listeria monocytogenes growth {{inhibition}} and growth rebound in raw and <b>cooked</b> <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> inoculated with Lactobacillus curvatus strains. During storage of raw meat homogenates {{in the presence}} of the bacteriocin-producing strain Lactobacillus curvatus CWBI-B 28 wt, the Listeria monocytogenes cfu count was initially reduced to an undetectable level, but a growth rebound occurred after two weeks, coinciding with loss of 70 % of the bacteriocin activity present at the end of week 2. The Listeria growth rebound was suppressed when proteolysis of bacteriocin was countered by the absence of proteases (bacteriocin addition to cooked meat) or the presence of 1 % soy flour (added to provide competing substrates). Further experiments confirmed that bacteriocin is sensitive to the action of proteolytic enzymes isolated from both Lactobacillus curvatus CWBI-B 28 wt and the meat matrix. Bacteriocin proteolysis thus emerges as a cause of Listeria growth rebound. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractConsumption of raw or inadequately <b>cooked</b> <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> {{may result}} in trichinellosis, a human disease due to {{nematodes}} of the genus Trichinella. In many countries worldwide, individual control of pig carcasses at meat inspection is mandatory but incurs high costs in relation to absence of positive carcasses from pigs reared under controlled housing. EU regulation 2015 / 1375 implements an alternative risk-based approach, in view of absence of positive findings in pigs under controlled housing conditions. Moreover, Codex Alimentarius guidelines for the control of Trichinella spp. in meat of suidae have been published (CAC, 2015) and {{used in conjunction with}} the OIE terrestrial Animal health code, to provide guidance to governments and industry on risk based control measures to prevent human exposure to Trichinella spp. and to facilitate international pork trade. To further support such a risk-based approach, we model the risk of human trichinellosis due to consumption of meat from infected pigs, raised under non-controlled housing and wild boar, using Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) methods. Our model quantifies the distribution of Trichinella muscle larve (ML) in swine, test sensitivity at carcass control, partitioning of edible pork parts, Trichinella ML distribution in edible muscle types, heat inactivation by cooking and portion sizes. The resulting exposure estimate is combined with a dose response model for Trichinella species to estimate the incidence of human illness after consumption of infected meat. Paramater estimation is based on experimental and observational datasets. In Poland, which served as example, we estimated an average incidence of 0. 90 (95 %CI: 0. 00 – 3. 68) trichinellosis cases per million persons per year (Mpy) due to consumption of pork from pigs that were reared under non-controlled housing, and 1. 97 (95 %CI: 0. 82 – 4. 00) cases per Mpy due to consumption of wild boar. The total estimated incidence of human trichinellosis attributed to pigs from non-controlled housing and wild boar in Poland, is similar to the incidence of human trichinellosis in that country reported by EFSA. Overall, in Europe, we estimated an upper incidence limit of 5. 3 × 10 − 4 cases per Mpy, or less than one predicted case of trichinellosis in the European Union every 4 years, due to consumption of pork from controlled housing. Therefore, Trichinella testing of pigs under controlled housing is not adding any value to protect human health. We suggest applying our farm-to-fork QMRA model to further support decision making on the global scale...|$|R

Morcilla, as in most Spanish-speaking countries, is basically <b>cooked</b> <b>pork</b> blood encased in pork intestine casing (black pudding in English). Longaniza is a thin sausage containing almost any mixture of meat, fat, or even cartilage, smoked rather than fresh. Chorizo {{is a mixture of}} chopped <b>pork</b> <b>meat,</b> <b>pork</b> fat, salt, whole pepper grains, cinnamon, achiote, and other spices, which produce its characteristic deep red color.

40|$|Six assays of low-fat venison salchichon were {{produced}} using varying proportions {{of olive oil}} to replace the traditional <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> added. The control contained 75 % lean venison and 25 % pork meat; in the other assays, 15, 25, 35, 45 and 55 % of the <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> was replaced by olive oil.

The replacement of 35 % or more of <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> by olive oil, prompted a decrease in odour intensity, spicy odour, hardness and an increase of fat mouthfeel, together with the olive oil perception. By contrast, the replacement of 25 % of <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> by olive oil yielded a salchichon not greatly different to the control. Consumers accepted all assays, but preferred those in which no more than 25 % of the <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> was replaced by olive oil.

Orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) showed that samples, regardless of the incubation temperature, could be splitted into 3 groups according to their spectral profile: 1) samples taken at time 0, 2) samples inoculated with B. thermosphacta and taken at final time, 3) samples uninoculated, taken at final time. From the analysis of the metabolomics data, higher concentrations of glycerol, glucose, taurine, lactate, carnitine, betaine and glycine were identified in the samples of uninoculated minced <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> and an increased production of creatine, acetate and acetone was found in the samples of minced <b>pork</b> <b>meat</b> inoculated with B. thermosphacta MM 008.
