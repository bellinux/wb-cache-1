40|$|IntroductionWarfarin is {{a widely}} used {{antithrombotic}} drug in prevention of both arterial and venous thrombosis. Glucosamine is a popular dietary supplement used in symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis. The interaction mechanism between these two drugs is not known yet. Case report 63 year old woman, who was taking warfarin therapy 5 mg /day for 5;months for pulmonary embolism (therapeutic INR range: 2. 0 – 3. 0), visited the emergency room with haematuria and rash. She had synchronous breast and colonic tumours for which right mastectomy and right hemicolectomy were done 5 months ago. Her INR (Internatıonal Normalized Ratio) values were highly increased (12. 5) due to consumption of a herbal drug involving glucosamine hydrochloride 250 mg, boswellia <b>extract</b> and <b>grapefruit</b> <b>extract</b> at that day for arthralgia. Boswellia extracts are used in management of osteoarthritis. Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale score was 6, which indicated a probable relationship between the patient’s elevated INR and use of two drugs (warfarin and herbal drug) at the same time. After discontinuation of both drugs, two units of fresh frozen plasma were given. Her INR reduced to 2. 5; as a result haematuria and rash regressed. This case report suggests a potential interaction between warfarin and both glucosamine and <b>grapefruit</b> <b>extract.</b> The inhibitory effect of <b>grapefruit</b> <b>extract</b> on cytochrome P 450 isoenzymes is combined with the effect of glucosamine.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the current research {{is the study of}} the possible beneficial anti-obesity and anti-diabetic effects of two natural extracts derived from helichrysum (Helichysum italicum) and grapefruit (Citrus x paradisi) through in vitro studies and animal models investigations. Obesity and diabetes are two of the biggest emerging health problems worldwide. Obesity is a multifactorial disease usually accompanied by insulin resistance (IR) and an increase in oxidative stress and inflammatory markers. On the other hand, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia as a result of impairments in insulin secretion and insulin action in target tissues. Several plant extracts rich in flavonoids have been reported to improve hyperglycemia by inhibiting digestive enzyme activities and SGLT 1 -mediated glucose uptake in the gut. Furthermore, flavonoids are widely recognized for biological and pharmacological effects including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The current work has analyzed the potential role of helichrysum and <b>grapefruit</b> <b>extracts</b> rich in flavonoids as anti-obesity and anti-diabetic agents. In the present research, helichrysum and <b>grapefruit</b> <b>extracts</b> improved postprandial glycemic control in rats, possibly by inhibiting the activities of carbohydrate-digestive enzymes and by decreasing SGLT 1 -mediated glucose uptake, which may be relevant for the treatment of obesity and T 2 DM. Furthermore, in a diabetic animal model (db/db mice), helichrysum and <b>grapefruit</b> <b>extracts</b> improved glucose metabolism in liver and the inflammatory status in liver and adipose tissue. Finally, in a model of energy restriction in overweight insulin-resistant rats, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects were found for both extracts, which may be associated to their beneficial metabolic effects. In this context and for oncoming studies, once the effectiveness and safety of the helichrysum and <b>grapefruit</b> <b>extracts</b> have been demonstrated, their use might be considered as a supplement and/or food complement or for the design of a functional food focused on weight loss and diabetes management...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{the study}} was to verify that the {{concomitant}} presence of <b>grapefruit</b> flavonoid <b>extract</b> with inulin in a Western-type diet may provide synergistic effects to the hindgut metabolism, as well as blood lipid and mineral profiles. Methods Forty male Wistar rats were distributed into 4 groups and fed for 28 days with diets rich in fat, cholesterol and protein. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA was applied to assess the effects of inulin (v. sucrose, 5 % of the diet), the addition of dietary <b>grapefruit</b> flavonoid <b>extract</b> (diets without or with 0. 3 % of an extract from hard parts of grapefruit) and the interaction between these two dietary factors. Results When compared to the control sucrose-containing diet, the diet enriched with inulin led to typical changes within the caecum, the main part of hindgut fermentation in rats, such as acidification of the digesta, support of bifidobacteria growth and increase of propionate and butyrate production. The dietary <b>grapefruit</b> flavonoid <b>extract</b> without inulin increased the bulk and pH value of caecal digesta, whereas short-chain fatty acid concentration and the bifidobacteria population were lowered compared to the extract-free diets. Simultaneous dietary addition of both tested components decreased slightly the pH value and increased somewhat the bifidobacteria number and the propionate concentration, however to the level observed with the control sucrose-containing diet. With regard to blood lipids, dietary <b>grapefruit</b> flavonoid <b>extract</b> decreased the triglyceride concentration regardless of the dietary carbohydrate type. Conclusion Inulin does not provide any additional benefit to the blood lipid profile caused by the dietary application of <b>grapefruit</b> flavonoid <b>extract</b> and it does not counteract clearly detrimental effects of the extract in the hindgut. Adding <b>grapefruit</b> <b>extract</b> to the diet must be performed with caution due to possible adverse hindgut responses with overdoses. </p...|$|R

40|$|Type- 2 {{diabetes}} {{is associated with}} a chronic low-grade systemic inflammation accompanied by an increased production of adipokines/cytokines by obese adipose tissue. The search for new antidiabetic drugs with different mechanisms of action, such as insulin sensitizers, insulin secretagogues and aglucosidase inhibitors, has directed the focus on the potential use of flavonoids in the management of type- 2 diabetes. Thirty six diabetic male C 57 BL/ 6 J db/db mice were fed a standard diet and randomly assigned into four experimental groups: non-treated control, (n ¼ 8); acarbose (5 mg per kg bw, n ¼ 8); helichrysum (1 g per kg bw, n ¼ 10) and grapefruit (0. 5 g per kg bw, n ¼ 10) for 6 weeks. The mRNA expression in pancreas, liver and epididymal adipose tissue was determined by RT-PCR. DNA methylation was quantified in epididymal fat using pyrosequencing. Mice supplemented with helichrysum and <b>grapefruit</b> <b>extracts</b> showed a significant decrease in fasting glucose levels (p < 0. 05). A possible mechanism of action could be the up-regulation of liver glucokinase (p < 0. 05). The antihyperglycemic effect of both extracts was accompanied by decreased mRNA expression of some proinflammatory genes (monocyte chemotactic protein- 1, tumor necrosis factor-a, cyclooxygenase- 2, nuclear factorkappaB) in the liver and epididymal adipose tissue. The CpG 3 site of TNFa, located 5 bp downstream of the transcription start site, showed increased DNA methylation in the grapefruit group compared with the non-treated group (p < 0. 01). In conclusion, helichrysum and <b>grapefruit</b> <b>extracts</b> improved hyperglycemia through the regulation of glucose metabolism in the liver and reduction of the expression of proinflammatory genes in the liver and visceral fat. The hypermethylation of TNFa in adipose tissue may contribute to reduce the inflammation associated with diabetes and obesity...|$|R

25|$|Anecdotal {{claims for}} an {{antimicrobial}} effect {{are based on}} abstract scientific experiments which show some antimicrobial activity in commercial <b>grapefruit</b> seed <b>extracts</b> and ethanol <b>grapefruit</b> seed <b>extract</b> but not natural GSE. The preliminary studies for the antimicrobial effect state that the Citricidal commercial brand of GSE was used for testing. There is considerable scientific evidence that the anti-microbial activity associated with <b>grapefruit</b> seed <b>extract</b> {{can be attributed to}} the contamination or adulteration of commercial GSE preparations with synthetic antimicrobials or preservatives. According to a 2001 study, branded commercial GSE preparations were contaminated with synthetic benzethonium chloride that was unlikely to have been made from grapefruit seeds. Some of the marketers claimed that their product did not contain benzethonium chloride and the error was due to the similarity in molecular weight of the quaternary ammonium compound which was formed through a proprietary manufacturing process. It is highly improbable that the preservative benzethonium chloride is formed during any extraction and/or processing of grapefruit seeds and pulp. Researchers conclusively demonstrated the presence of benzethonium chloride in commercial GSE using various analytical methods including HPLC, one- and two-dimensional NMR, PIXE analysis, and electrospray ionization MS. Another in vitro study claimed GSE had antibacterial properties. As with the branded in vitro test this extract was contaminated.

50|$|Although <b>grapefruit</b> seed <b>extract</b> (GSE) is {{promoted}} as a plant-based preservative by some natural personal care manufacturers, {{studies have shown}} that the apparent antimicrobial activity associated with GSE preparations is merely due to contamination with synthetic preservatives such as parabens.|$|R

40|$|Um experimento avaliou a adição de ractopamina e extratos cítricos a dietas de suínos em terminação. Foram utilizados 108 suínos (54 machos e 54 fêmeas) em um delineamento de blocos completos ao acaso, sendo o sexo o fator de bloqueamento e nove os tratamentos: T 1. controle (C) (0 ppm de ractopamina e 0 ppm de extratos cítricos), T 2. C+ 10 RAC (ractopamina, em ppm), T 3. C+ 20 RAC, T 4. C+ 250 EC (extratos cítricos, em ppm), T 5. C+ 500 EC, T 6. C+ 250 EC+ 10 RAC, T 7. C+ 250 EC+ 20 RAC, T 8. C+ 500 EC+ 10 RAC e T 9. C+ 500 EC+ 20 RAC. O peso vivo final (109, 9 ± 3, 6 kg), consumo de ração (2, 6 ± 0, 2 kgd- 1), ganho de peso (1, 0 ± 0, 1 kgd- 1), conversão alimentar (2, 7 ± 0, 2), comprimento de carcaça (97, 0 ± 2, 7 cm), profundidade de músculo (56, 1 ± 5, 6 mm) e pH (5, 9 ± 0, 3) não foram influenciados pelos tratamentos. Sobre o peso de carcaça, o efeito foi somente do tratamento com 20 ppm de ractopamina em relação a 10 ppm de ractopamina, sendo 5, 7 % {{superior}}. A espessura de toucinho do grupo controle foi 35 % superior aos níveis de ractopamina, e a interação foi 500 ppm de extratos cítricos e 10 ppm de ractopamina. A carne magra do controle foi 5, 3 % inferior em relação aos níveis de ractopamina. A alimentação de suínos em terminação com dietas contendo ractopamina, extratos cítricos e suas interações não altera o desempenho, mas influencia algumas características de carcaça. This {{study was}} carried out to evaluate {{the effect of the}} addition of the <b>citrus</b> <b>extracts</b> and ractopamine in finishing pig diets. A Hundred eight pigs were used (54 males and 54 females) in a completely randomized design, blocked by sex and distributed in nine treatments: T 1. control (C) (0 ppm of the ractopamine e 0 ppm of the <b>citrus</b> <b>extracts),</b> T 2. C+ 10 RAC (ractopamine, ppm), T 3. C+ 20 RAC, T 4. C+ 250 EC (<b>citrus</b> <b>extracts,</b> ppm), T 5. C+ 500 EC, T 6. C+ 250 EC+ 10 RAC, T 7. C+ 250 EC+ 20 RAC, T 8. C+ 500 EC+ 10 RAC and T 9. C+ 500 EC+ 20 RAC. The final body weight (109. 9 ± 3. 60 kg), feed intake (2. 6 ± 0. 24 kg d- 1), body weight gain (1. 01 ± 0. 09 kg d- 1), feed conversion ratio (2. 7 ± 0. 25), carcass length (97 ± 2. 71 cm), depth muscle (56. 1 ± 5. 63 mm), and pH (5. 9 ± 0. 33) were not affected by treatments. There was a significant effect for the treatment with 20 ppm of ractopamine, which was 5. 7 higher, in relation to the treatment with 10 ppm of ractopamine. The backfat thickness of control group was 35 % higher than the ractopamine levels and the interaction was of 10 ppm of ractopamine and 500 ppm of <b>citrus</b> <b>extracts.</b> The lean meat in the control group was on average, 5. 3 % lower in relation to the ractopamine levels. Feeding of finishing pigs with diets containing ractopamine, <b>citrus</b> <b>extracts</b> and their interactions didn't affect performance, however affected some carcass characteristics...|$|R

40|$|<b>Citrus</b> <b>extracts,</b> {{particularly}} bergamot {{essential oil}} (BEO) and its fractions, {{have been found}} to exhibit anticancer efficacy. However, the poor water solubility, low stability and limited bioavailability have prevented the use of BEO in cancer therapy. To overcome such drawbacks, we formulated BEO liposomes that improved the water solubility of the phytocomponents and increased their anticancer activity in vitro against human SH-SY 5 Y neuroblastoma cells. The results warrant further investigation of BEO liposomes for in vivo applications. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the effect of high {{pressure}} at 300 and 500 MPa for 3 and 10 min on the phenolic compounds, antioxidant capacity and antimicrobial activity of <b>citrus</b> peel <b>extracts.</b> Total phenolic contents (TPC) and antioxidant properties of extracts were determined as free radical-scavenging ability of DPPH and using the ABTS radical cation decolorization assay. Additionally, extracts were tested for antimicrobial activity against twenty different strains of bacteria representing both Gram-positive and Gram-negative types. <b>Citrus</b> peel <b>extracts</b> demonstrated antimicrobial activity against {{a wide range of}} bacteria. The maximum level of TPC as well as antioxidant capacity were observed at 300 MPa for 3 min. <b>Citrus</b> peels <b>extracts</b> demonstrated antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microorganisms. The antimicrobial activity of orange peel extract was the highest among the four citrus peels studied.
