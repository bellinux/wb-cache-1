25|$|The {{mechanism}} {{inside the}} first stage can be of the diaphragm type or the piston type. Both types can be balanced or unbalanced. Unbalanced regulators have the cylinder pressure pushing {{the first stage}} upstream valve closed, which is opposed by the intermediate stage pressure and a spring. As cylinder pressure falls the <b>closing</b> <b>force</b> is less, so the regulated pressure increases at lower tank pressure. To keep this pressure rise within acceptable limits the high-pressure orifice size is limited, but this decreases the total flow capacity of the regulator.

50|$|Another {{advantage}} of hydroforming is that complex shapes {{can be made}} in one step. In sheet hydroforming (SHF) with the bladder acting as the male die almost limitless geometries can be produced. However, the process is limited by the very high <b>closing</b> <b>force</b> required in order to seal the dies, especially for large panels and thick hard materials. Small concave corner radii are difficult to be completely calibrated, i.e. filled, because too large a pressure would be required. in fact, the die <b>closing</b> <b>force</b> can be very high, both in tube and sheet hydroforming and may easily overcome the maximum tonnage of the forming press. In order to keep the die <b>closing</b> <b>force</b> under prescribed limits, the maximum internal fluid pressure must be limited. This reduces the calibration abilities of the process, i.e. it reduces the possibility of forming parts with small concave radii.Limits of the SHF process are due to risks of excessive thinning, fracture, wrinkling and are strictly related to the material formability and to a proper selection of process parameters (e.g. hydraulic pressure vs. time curve). Tube hydroforming (THF) can produce many geometric options as well, reducing the need for tube welding operations. Similar limitations and risks can be listed as in SHF; however, the maximum <b>closing</b> <b>force</b> is seldom a limiting factor in THF.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} suture tension in primary wound closure of mucoperiosteal flaps. Materials and methods: Sixty patients, scheduled for a single implant installation, were recruited. Before suturing, the wound <b>closing</b> <b>forces</b> were measured with an electronic tension device. One week after the surgery, the wounds were inspected with regard to complete closure. Results: The applied tension varied between 0. 01 and 0. 4 N. In 72 % a tension of 0. 01 - 0. 1 N was applied, resulting in few dehiscences (10 %). Higher <b>closing</b> <b>forces</b> (> 0. 1 N) increased the percentage of wound dehiscences significantly (≥ 40 %).

50|$|The grab {{has to be}} {{selected}} so that the combined weight of grab and contents does not exceed the grabbing safe working load of the crane. The mass of the contents depends upon {{the properties of the}} product being handled; its density, flow characteristics, angle of repose, lump/grain size, purity (e.g. is it wet or dry) and, in some cases, degree of settlement (e.g. a ship's cargo has compacted due to vibration, rolling, pitching and yawing over a long voyage). Most bulk-handling cranes are dedicated to a single product, but others will handle various materials and need a selection of grabs. Some applications (e.g. manganese ore) may also require the use of teeth fitted to the grab jaws to enable penetration. Other applications (e.g. rape seed) may require to be self-sealing and have offset lower jaws with serrated, angle cut side cutters to restrain easy-flow properties.When off-loading a ship, the grab may be more efficient if designed with a low-profile extended body which enables reaching under the ship's hatches, negating any need to centre the product with human and machinery access.The grab mechanism may be four rope, double rope, single rope ring discharge, single rope self-dumping, double chain, single chain self-dumping, single chain ring discharge, hydraulic or electro-hydraulic.Rope grabs have rope pulleys in both the upper and lower girders and close by drawing the closing rope(s) to shorten the gap between the two girders. The minimum diameter of the pulley is restricted by the ratio of the pulley diameter to the rope diameter, the strands of the wire rope being subjected to fatigue bending stresses if the pulley is too small, giving premature failure. The physical size of the pulleys then determines the size of the girders, then determining a break point between a four rope and a two rope design. The <b>closing</b> <b>force</b> at the shell jaws, and, inversely, the speed of closure, are determined by the number of pulleys on each closing rope in the two girders. The closing rope is fed into the grab mechanism through either a bellmouth or an arrangement of small rollers. The weight of the grab is supported by the holding rope(s) and pinned to the upper girder allowing some angular freedom. Holding and closing ropes require separate winding drums in the crane.The mechanism on chain grabs operates {{in the same way as}} on rope grabs. The chains are connected to ropes on the crane by (e.g. bordeaux) couplings which allow rotation. A linked chain requires a much small diameter pulley than the equivalent rope which makes a smaller, more compact, design of girder. Chains used on chain pulleys are less easily inspected for wear and fatigue than ropes which show outer strand deformation well before failure. Failure of a rope or chain is a very high severity (dangerous) hazard.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the combined force transfer from the papillary muscle tips to the mitral valve through the chordae tendineae in vivo, and thereby quantify the force transmitted through the papillary–chordal complex to augment left ventricular ejection. MethodsIn an acute porcine model (n =  8), force transfer between papillary muscles and the mitral valve was recorded on the anterior and posterior papillary muscle tip using dedicated force transducers. Ultrasound sonomicrometry was utilized to record and calculate left ventricular long-axis shortening and mitral annular geometry. The <b>closing</b> <b>force</b> acting on the mitral valve leaflets was calculated as mitral annular area multiplied by the transmitral pressure difference throughout systole. Mitral valve competence was verified before measurements with color Doppler ultrasound. ResultsPeak force in the anterior and posterior papillary muscle was 5. 9 ± 0. 6 N and 5. 8 ± 0. 7 N (mean ± standard error of the mean), respectively, and peak <b>closing</b> <b>force</b> was 6. 8 ± 0. 3 N all at a transmitral pressure of 90 mm Hg. Peak rate of left ventricular contraction coincided with peak papillary muscle force. ConclusionsThis study is the first to assess the magnitude and time course of the longitudinal force transmitted through the papillary–chordal complex to the left ventricular wall during ejection. The study also demonstrates a significant force transfer to the <b>closing</b> <b>force</b> acting on the mitral valve leaflets that constitutes an essential component of valvular–ventricular interaction to enhance left ventricular systolic pump performance. The magnitude of the combined papillary muscle force component emphasizes the crucial role of preserving mitral valve–left ventricular continuity in mitral valve surgery...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{studied the}} acute effects of cardiac {{resynchronization}} therapy (CRT) on functional mitral regurgitation in heart failure (HF) patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB). BackgroundBoth {{a decrease in}} left ventricular (LV) <b>closing</b> <b>force</b> and mitral valve tethering have been implicated as mechanisms for functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) in dilated hearts. We hypothesized that an increase in LV <b>closing</b> <b>force</b> achieved by CRT could act to reduce FMR. MethodsTwenty-four HF patients with LBBB and FMR were studied after implantation of a biventricular CRT system. Acute changes in FMR severity between intrinsic conduction (OFF) and CRT were quantified according to the proximal isovelocity surface area method by measuring the effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA). Results were compared with the changes in estimated maximal rate of left ventricular systolic pressure rise (LV+dP/dtmax) and transmitral pressure gradients (TMP), both measured by Doppler echocardiography. ResultsCardiac resynchronization therapy {{was associated with a}} significant reduction in FMR severity. Effective regurgitant orifice area decreased from 25 ± 19 mm 2 (OFF) to 13 ± 8 mm 2 (CRT). The change in EROA was directly related to the increase in LV+dP/dtmax(r = − 0. 83, p < 0. 0001). Compared with OFF, TMP increased more rapidly during CRT, and a higher maximal TMP was observed (OFF 73 ± 24 mm Hg vs. CRT 85 ± 26 mm Hg, p < 0. 01). ConclusionsFunctional mitral regurgitation is reduced by CRT in patients with HF and LBBB. This effect {{is directly related to the}} increased <b>closing</b> <b>force</b> (LV+dP/dtmax). The results support the hypothesis that an increase in TMP, mediated by a rise in LV+dP/dtmaxdue to more coordinated LV contraction, may facilitate effective mitral valve closure...|$|E
