25|$|The 8C engine, {{first entered}} at the 1931 Mille Miglia road race through Italy, had a common crankcase, now with two alloy four-cylinder blocks, which also {{incorporated}} the heads. The {{bore and stroke}} (and hence rods, pistons and the like), {{were the same as}} the 6C 1750 (bore: 65mm, stroke: 88mm 2,336cc). There was no separate head, and no head gasket to fail, but this made valve maintenance more difficult. A <b>central</b> <b>gear</b> tower drove the overhead camshafts, superchargers and ancillaries. As far as production cars are concerned, the 8C engine powered two models, the 8C 2300 (1931–1935) and the even more rare and expensive 8C 2900 (1936–1941), bore increased to 68mm and stroke to 100mm (2,905cc).|$|E
500|$|Each {{end of each}} caisson is {{supported}} on small wheels, which run on rails on the inside face of the [...] diameter holes {{at the ends of}} the arms. The rotation is controlled by a train of gears: an alternating pattern of three [...] diameter ring gears and two smaller idler gears, all with external teeth, as shown in the picture. The large <b>central</b> <b>gear</b> is fitted loosely over the axle at its machine-room end and fixed in place prevent it from rotating. The two smaller gears are fixed to each of the arms of the wheel at its machine-room end. When the motors rotate the central axle, the arms swing and the small gears engage the <b>central</b> <b>gear,</b> which results in the smaller gears rotating at a higher speed than the wheel but in the same direction. The smaller gears engage the large ring gears {{at the end of the}} caissons, driving them at the same speed as the wheel but in the opposite direction. This cancels the rotation due to the arms and keeps the caissons stable and perfectly level.|$|E

50|$|Terra Crusher had all {{the major}} {{features}} of T-Maxx, including big tires, 4 by 4 with two shocks per tire, in two-speed transmission, as well as reverse gear and on-board starting system. In addition, Terra Crusher was bigger. T-Maxx weighed 4 kg 4 kg, Terra Crusher weighed 5.7 kg. Terra Crusher was offered {{at about the same}} street price of $400. To lower the production cost, Terra Crusher had two channel radio system included, instead of the three channel set offered with T-Maxx. Lacking this extra gear meant that reverse was done with a differential gear. T-Maxx reversed by using a gear shift, controlled by third channel. In Terra Crusher, however, one of the <b>central</b> <b>gears</b> had a set of differential gears inside. When the brake is applied, this gear is also stopped, and differential engaged to rotate the connected gears in opposite direction. It was an ingenious solution, however setting proved delicate and complicated, not to mention adding extra weight to the gears. Later models did away with this mechanism.|$|R
50|$|The Owen was an {{automobile}} built in Detroit, Michigan by the Owen Motor Car Company from 1910-14.

50|$|From {{the outset}} the largest problem was {{torsional}} vibration of the crankshaft, {{at one time}} necessitating a ban on using below 4000rpm on the bench. The vibration often caused one or other of the cranks to shear itself off the <b>central</b> spur <b>gear,</b> resulting in the engine becoming two aphasic flat-8s, or the parallel quill shaft (driven at 0.8 times the crank speed, located below crank, and in turn driving the flywheel and ancillaries) overheated and disintegrated.|$|R
40|$|The known {{attempts}} {{to create a}} continuously-adjustable gear train with solid gears have led to development of some so-called adaptive gears. The most structurally simple version of continuously- adjustable gear train is a two-wheel planetary gear. It is an obvious fact that an active regulation of gear ratio for the gear {{should be based on}} the presence of con- trolled elements (parameters) and a mechanism for their control. In respect of the mentioned gear one of the controlled elements that is a compound <b>central</b> toothed <b>gear</b> has such controlled parameter as a nominal pitch diameter. In this case it can rotate or remain motionless. Other controlled element which is a planetary carrier has its own radius as a controlled parameter and makes a rotary motion with a great speed of a leading element. The purpose of the control mechanism is to ensure radial displacement of <b>central</b> toothed <b>gear</b> and planet gear sectors in the working gear. The paper describes the mechanism modifications and considers two variants for transfer of control action from its source to an object to be controlled. The transfer is ensured by mechanical gears (two variants) and hydraulics. </p...|$|R
50|$|Automatic {{transmission}} {{families are}} usually based on Ravigneaux, Lepelletier, or Simpson planetary gearsets. Each uses some arrangement {{of one or}} two <b>central</b> sun <b>gears,</b> and a ring gear, with differing arrangements of planet gears that surround the sun and mesh with the ring. An exception to this is the Hondamatic line from Honda, which uses sliding gears on parallel axes like a manual transmission without any planetary gearsets. Although the Honda is quite different from all other automatics, it is also quite different from an automated manual transmission (AMT).|$|R

50|$|By {{the middle}} of the 1962 season, Peter Windsor Smith and Walter Hassan were {{convinced}} that the only viable route to more power was through higher revs, and the decision was made, partly in light of Harry Mundy's experiences on the 1.5-Litre supercharged BRM V16, to develop a 1.5-Litre flat-16 designated the FWMW. Design work started in 1963, and a prototype was running on the bench in late 1964 with two flatplane flat-8 cranks (not a boxer arrangement, but rather like a 180 degree V8 with shared crank pins) shrunk-fit to a <b>central</b> spur <b>gear</b> at 90 degrees phase shift to each other.|$|R

50|$|Current SH-AWD {{configurations}} are all mated to a transverse engine, {{either a}} turbo-charged in-line four-cylinder Honda K-Series engine {{in the case}} of the RDX, or naturally aspirated V-6 versions of the Honda J-Series engine. The engines are mated to a front-wheel-drive transaxle. There is no center differential. The transaxle is bolted to torque transfer unit that spins a center drive shaft that powers the rear differential unit. The rear differential is a T-shaped device. Power coming from the engine is transferred via a <b>central</b> hypoid <b>gear</b> that delivers power to each rear axle. Power to the each axle is modulated by identical planetary gear sets and electromagnetic clutch packs which can vary incoming power side to side.|$|R

In order to accommodate the barges and sloops that serviced the factories, a movable span was installed, so well balanced on its <b>central</b> <b>gear</b> that it could be turned by one man with nothing more than a wrench. When water craft needed to pass through, the entire bridge rotated perpendicular to the banks of Cedar Pond Brook over which the bridge extended. The bridge got its name from the penny charged for overland passage. Penny Bridge was demolished in 1951. A plaque commemorates its original location.|$|E
50|$|Mercedes-Benz {{would create}} the last notable straight-eight racing cars in 1955, with the championship-winning W196 Formula One racing {{car and the}} 300SLR sports racing car. The 300SLR was famous for Stirling Moss and Denis Jenkinson's victory in the 1955 Mille Miglia, but notorious for Pierre Levegh's deadly {{accident}} at the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans. The 300SLR was the final development of the Alfa Romeo design of the early 1930s as not only the camshaft, but now also the gearbox was driven from the engine's centre. Engineers calculated that torsional stresses would be too high if they took power {{from the end of}} the long crankshaft, so they put a <b>central</b> <b>gear</b> train in the middle (which also ran the dual camshafts, dual magnetos, and other accessories) and ran a drive shaft to the clutch housing at the rear.|$|E

5000|$|Hirth's joints {{were first}} used in {{aircraft}} engine crankshafts. A {{large number of}} cylinders and often the need for reduction gears and supercharger drives made it impractical to manufacture a one-piece crankshaft, so Hirth joints were used to couple the sections. They have used in complex crankshafts for many years afterward, particularly where the output power was taken from a <b>central</b> drive <b>gear.</b> As a large gear could neither be formed-in-place nor passed over the crank webs, it could be machined separately and placed between two half-crankshafts with Hirth's joints. They are also used in gas turbine shafts, in accessories for surgical operating tables, in agricultural machines for fixing tools etc., and in bike parts and frames, such as Campagnolo's [...] "Ultra-Torque" [...] bicycle crankset, and in Bicycle Torque Couplings.|$|R
