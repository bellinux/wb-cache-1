40|$|Handover {{in future}} {{wireless}} communication systems must be seamless. Current IP-level mobility protocols have difficulties meeting the stringent handover delay requirements. At {{the same time}} they do not give sufficient control to the network to optimize the handover process and they do not deal well with slow <b>connection</b> <b>setups</b> of some wireless technologies. In this paper we propose an enhancement of Proxy MIPv 6 (PMIPv 6) with Simultaneous bindings. The result, called SPMIPv 6, is a proactive network-controlled handover solution that allows some handover processes to be carried proactively while the mobile node is connected to the serving network. We analyze SPMIPv 6 performance and show that the handover latency can be limited to one RTT between the mobile node and the target access router, which is typically below 10 ms, and that the packet loss due to handover can be decreased and eliminated by appropriately buffering packets at the target access router. Moreover, our performance evaluation based on a SPMIPv 6 implementation shows no TCP and UDP performance degradation during handovers. Two important characteristics of SPMIPv 6 are its robustness to incorrect handover predictions and its built-in features to accommodate large network attachment latencies...|$|R

40|$|Despite its {{widespread}} {{adoption and}} popularity, the Hyper-text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) suffers from fundamental performance limitations. SPDY, a recently proposed alter-native to HTTP, tries to address {{many of the}} limitations of HTTP (e. g., multiple <b>connections,</b> <b>setup</b> latency). With cellular networks fast becoming the communication chan-nel of choice, we perform a detailed measurement study to understand the benefits of using SPDY over cellular net-works. Through careful measurements conducted over four months, we provide a detailed analysis of the performance of HTTP and SPDY, how they interact with the various layers, and their implications on web design. Our results show that unlike in wired and 802. 11 networks, SPDY does not clearly outperform HTTP over cellular networks. We identify, as the underlying cause, a lack of harmony between how TCP and cellular networks interact. In particular, the performance of most TCP implementations is impacted by their implicit assumption that the network round-trip la-tency does not change after an idle period, which is typi-cally not the case in cellular networks. This causes spurious retransmissions and degraded throughput for both HTTP and SPDY. We conclude that a viable solution has to ac-count for these unique cross-layer dependencies to achieve improved performance over cellular networks...|$|R

50|$|The {{basis of}} the data {{transfer}} control protocol in RINA is the Delta-T protocol. Watson proved that the necessary and sufficient conditions for reliable transfer is to bound three timers. Delta-T {{is an example of}} how this should work. It does not require a <b>connection</b> <b>setup</b> (such as TCP’s SYN handshake) or tear-down (like TCP’s FIN handshake) for integrity purposes. In fact, TCP uses the same three timers! So RINA avoids unnecessary overhead. Watson showed that synchronization and port allocation are distinct functions. Port allocation is part of DIF management, while synchronization is part of the data transfer protocol. In fact, maintaining the distinction also improves the security of <b>connection</b> <b>setup,</b> and avoids the need for separate protocols like IPSec, since multiple transport connections can be associated to the same port allocation.|$|E
40|$|III Today’s {{communication}} {{networks are}} evolving towards an all-IP architecture. IP-level mobility protocols {{will have to}} support seamless handovers from one access technology to another. Existing IP-level mobility protocols have difficulties meeting these stringent handover delay requirements. Also, they do not give sufficient control to the network to optimize the handover process {{and they do not}} deal well with slow <b>connection</b> <b>setups</b> of some wireless technologies. This thesis presents a networked controlled IP-level mobility protocol called Simultaneous Binding Proxy Mobile IPv 6 (SPMIPv 6), based on the existing Proxy Mobile IPv 6 protocol. The protocol deals with large layer 2 setup times by taking a proactive approach towards the handover. It is allows some parts of the handover process to be carried out before the actual handover. In the networks itself, packets for the MN are already sent to the MN’s new point of attachment before the actual handover. This way, the handover latency can be limited to one RTT between the mobile node and the new access router and the packet loss due to handover can be decreased and eliminated by appropriately buffering packets at the new access router. The SPMIPv 6 protocol was implemented in testbed, which showed that both UDP and TCP do not suffer from any performance degradation during the actual handover. Two important characteristics of SPMIPv 6 are its robustness to incorrect handover predictions and its built-in features to accommodate large network attachment latencies. I...|$|R

40|$|Address event {{representation}} (AER) is {{a widely}} employed asynchronous technique for interchanging “neural spikes” between different hardware elements in neuromorphic systems. Each neuron or cell in a chip or a system is assigned an address (or ID), which is typically communicated through a high-speed digital bus, thus time-multiplexing {{a high number of}} neural connections. Conventional AER links use parallel physical wires together with a pair of handshaking signals (request and acknowledge). In this paper, we present a fully serial implementation using bidirectional SATA connectors with a pair of low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) wires for each direction. The proposed implementation can multiplex a number of conventional parallel AER links for each physical LVDS connection.
