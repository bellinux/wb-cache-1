The tests comprised measurements, using the optical method, of spindle-neck coating produced from EN AW- 2024 (AlCu 4 Mg 1) alloy, and sub-jected to, in the first variant, the operation of burnishing, and in the second variant – the burnishing operation followed by hard anodic oxidation and grinding with abrasive paper having a grain size of 600. Moreover, {{to be able to do}} it, the <b>circularity</b> <b>deviation</b> of the cylindrical part of the neck coating at the same distances from the face of the crown were measured with the use of a Taylrond 365 circularity tester. Next, based on the contours of circularity obtained, a contour of cylindrical shape of the spindle-neck coating, both burnished and burnished and anodic oxidized, brand-new and after an operational time was prepared. An assessment of the topography and microphotography of the oxide layer of the spindle-neck coating was performed, both in brand-new condition and after an op-erational time.

40|$|Keeping up {{the product}} {{competitiveness}} continually requires solving {{the problems of}} reducing time for product creation and material costs for its production and ensuring the maximum conformity of the product quality with the individual requirements of a particular consumer. It is especially difficult to implement these tasks in product manufacturing from the hard-to-machine steels and alloys with extremely low production rate in machining (often 10 - 20 times lower than when cutting the ordinary structural steels). Currently, one of the promising {{ways to improve the}} cutting process of hard-to-machine materials and quality of parts made from these materials is development and application of combined processing methods, which use additional energy sources to act on the machined material in the cutting zone. A BMSTU-developed cutting method with leading plastic deformation (LPD), which acts to raise the production rate, gain the cutting tool-life, reduce the surface roughness, improve the accuracy of processing and the performance characteristics of products, ensure the reliable flow chip control, and improve the labor conditions, belongs to such sort of methods. One of the most important indicators of processing quality that has a great impact on the operation and cost characteristics of the product and on the machining rate as well is the accuracy of processing. In cutting, the processing errors largely arise from the elastic deformations of a technological system when the cutting force, and, in particular, the radial component of the cutting force, acts on it. The deforming devices, used in cutting with LPD, being located as a rule, on the diametrically opposite side with respect to the cutting zone, act on the technological system as vibration dampers. In addition, as studies have shown, the choice of a rational direction for applying LPD load helps to compensate partially or completely the cutting force radial component effect on the technological system, thereby raising the accuracy of processing through reducing a value of the elastic deformations of a work-piece in the cutting zone. The paper presents the comparative test results of the work-piece shape accuracy in cutting with LPD and in conventional cutting in two respects: profile deviation of the longitudinal section of the cylindrical surface and <b>circularity</b> <b>deviation.</b> The studies were carried out using a special BMSTU-designed installation, which allows us to regulate direction of the angle of LPD force action, and, consequently, the load values in direction perpendicular to the surface to be machined. The experiments were carried out on soft samples, made from the low rigid hard-to-machine materials, belonging to different groups of machining property. It is found that when cutting with LPD there is a significant reduction of shape errors. For the processing conditions, assumed in the experiments, as compared to the ordinary cutting a deviation of the profile of the longitudinal section and a <b>circularity</b> <b>deviation</b> were decreased by 2. 4 - 3. 3 times and 1. 2 - 1. 6 times, respectively. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to {{compensate}} the elastic deformations of the technological system in order to achieve maximum cross sectional accuracy and productivity of turning operation with minimum cost. This study was based on developing of mechanical adaptive system (MAS) for accuracy control by dynamic adjustment of the tool position during processing. The dynamic characteristic of components of the engine lathe technological system supplied with the proposed MAS was studied, and a mathematical model was obtained and presented as a system with one degree of freedom in the direction of Z-axis. The stable zones of operating were defined using Leonarion graphic method. The optimal cutting parameters correspond to stationary positions of equilibrium were obtained when processing heat resistant steel under the following conditions: feed rate, S, ranges from 0. 07 to 0. 39 mm/rev; depth of cut, t, ranges from 0. 5 to 1. 5 mm; and turning speed, υ, ranges from 0. 55 to 1. 45 m/sec. Experimental examination of the proposed system showed that the use of adaptive control may overcome the error appeared due to the elastic deformation of the technological system. The maximum <b>circularity</b> <b>deviation</b> of the processed, using the developed MAS, cylindrical surfaces did not exceed 40 microns, whereas 98 microns of maximum deviation was reached using usual cutter. The developed MAS can, in number of cases, replace the cylindrical external grinding processing by usual cutting on lathe machine tools, providing thus the rigid requirements on dimensional and form accuracy in cross sections...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. There {{are many}} machines, devices and {{production}} lines that {{are equipped with}} rotating elements (shafts, axes, spindles, trailing and drive wheels, etc.). Correct geometry of these elements ensures trouble-free operation, and, {{in the case of}} machine tools it decides about the correct geometric parameters of the manufactured semi-finished articles and pro-ducts. In this respect, the newly manufactured and operated lathes are checked against the cor-rect geometry of their parts which determine the location of the work-piece and the lathe and their movement These parts are geometrically correct if the errors of their geometrical shape (deviations) do not exceed values designated in the standards. The wearing of lathes reveals the so-called spindle run-out (<b>deviation</b> from <b>circularity).</b> These <b>deviations</b> are determined using mainly the workshop methods. However, due to the considerable sizes of machine tools surveying methods and new methods which use elec-tronic and optoelectronic devices also apply. Authors of this work present the measuring set (which they designed and built themselves) which relies on the two-point fibre signalling device which is installed in the lathe spindle chuck jaws. The position of the signalling device during the lathe spindle rotation is recorded with CCD/CMOS digital camera, and the images are stored on the camera memory card. The aim of the presented research and experimental works was to determine the internal conformity of measurement results that were obtained using the designed and constructed measuring set, to check whether there is a correlation between the results obtained using the dial indicator and to analyse the accuracy of observations that were made using the test set. The designed measuring set enables to determine <b>deviations</b> from <b>circularity</b> during the lathe spindle rotation with the accuracy of ± 0. 02 mm.
