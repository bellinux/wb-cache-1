2500|$|Coble creep is {{a second}} form of {{diffusion}} controlled creep. In Coble creep the atoms diffuse along grain boundaries to elongate the grains along the stress axis. This causes Coble creep to have a stronger grain size dependence than Nabarro–Herring creep, thus, Coble creep will be more important in materials composed of very fine grains. For Coble creep k {{is related to the}} diffusion coefficient of atoms along the grain boundary, Q = Q(grain boundary diffusion), m = 1, and b = 3. Because Q(grain boundary diffusion) < Q(self diffusion), Coble creep occurs at lower temperatures than Nabarro–Herring creep. Coble creep is still temperature dependent, as the temperature increases so does the grain boundary diffusion. However, since the number of nearest neighbors is effectively limited along the interface of the grains, and thermal generation of vacancies along the boundaries is less prevalent, the temperature dependence is not as strong as in Nabarro–Herring creep. It also exhibits the same linear dependence on stress as Nabarro–Herring creep. Generally, the diffusional creep rate should be the sum of Nabarro–Herring creep rate and Coble creep rate. Diffusional creep leads to grain-boundary separation, that is, voids or cracks form between the grains. To heal this, grain-boundary sliding occurs. The diffusional creep rate and the grain boundary sliding rate must be balanced if there are no voids or cracks remain. When grain-boundary sliding couldn't accommodate the incompatibility, [...] grain-boundary voids are generated, which is related to the initiation of <b>creep</b> <b>fracture.</b>|$|E
50|$|When exposed {{for long}} times to high {{temperatures}} and moderate stresses, metals exhibit premature and low-ductility <b>creep</b> <b>fracture,</b> {{arising from the}} formation and growth of cavities. Those defects coalesce into cracks which ultimately cause macroscopic failure. Self-healing of early stage damage is thus a promising new approach to extend the lifetime of the metallic components. In metals, self-healing is intrinsically more difficult to achieve than in most other material classes, due to their high melting point and, as a result, low atom mobility. Generally, defects in the metals are healed by the formation of precipitates at the defect sites that immobilize further crack growth.Improved creep and fatigue properties have been reported for underaged aluminium alloys compared to the peak hardening Al alloys, {{which is due to}} the heterogeneous precipitation at the crack tip and its plastic zone. The first attempts to heal creep damage in steels were focused on the dynamic precipitation of either Cu or BN at the creep-cavity surface. Cu precipitation has only a weak preference for deformation-induced defects as a large fraction of spherical Cu precipitates is simultaneously formed with the matrix. Recently, gold atoms were recognized as a highly efficient healing agents in Fe-based alloys. A defect-induced mechanism is indicated for the Au precipitation, i.e. the Au solute remains dissolved until defects are formed. Autonomous repair of high-temperature creep damage was reported by alloying {{with a small amount of}} Au. Healing agents selectively precipitate at the free surface of a creep cavity, resulting in pore filling. For the lower stress levels up to 80% filling of the creep cavities with Au precipitates is achieved resulting in a substantial increase in creep life time. Work to translate the concept of creep damage healing in simple binary or ternary model systems to real multicomponent creep steels is ongoing.|$|E

An experimental method for the nanocolumn arrays using a micro-brick specimen (2 μm high and 2 μm wide) {{was used for}} the creep experiments. To clarify whether the nanoscale stress concentration dominated the <b>creep</b> <b>fracture,</b> two types of specimens were prepared: a forward specimen (loading with the column tilt direction) and a reverse specimen (loading against the column tilt direction), where the reverse specimen had a higher stress singularity at the interface edge than the forward specimen. The Ti nanocolumns deformed in a time-dependent manner under a constant applied force and then fractured at the interface. The forward specimens required a higher applied force than the reverse specimens for a similar fracture life. The local stress distribution along the Ti/Si interface during the creep experiments was analyzed using finite element method. The Mises stresses near the edge in the region of about 5 nm were very close in forward and reverse specimens with similar fracture lives. This suggested that the local stress field in the nanoscale region dominated the <b>creep</b> <b>fracture.</b> In addition, the room temperature creep of the nanocolumns greatly accelerated in comparison with their bulk counterparts...|$|E

40|$|Creep {{failure of}} the weld {{structure}} in P 91 steel components in high temperature power plant applications is often a key factor limiting the lifetime of the components. Whilst creep failure in weld heat-affected zone (HAZ) regions has been studied widely, the creep properties of the weld metal itself have been less well documented. In this work, the creep response of P 91 weld metal in isolation was investigated in terms of microstructural evolution and mechanical properties. The microstructural examination of P 91 multi-pass weld metal revealed a typical weld metal structure including columnar regions and refined regions. The columnar region exhibited high hardness whilst the refined region exhibited lower hardness. The anisotropic creep behaviour of P 91 weld metal was observed in creep tests of both longitudinal and transverse specimens at 650 ºC and various stress levels. This behaviour can be correlated with the microstructural anisotropy observed, where longitudinal specimens with banded columnar regions and refined regions parallel to the stress axis had longer creep life than transverse specimens with overlapped typical-shape beads. Longitudinal weld specimens showed higher strain to failure than transverse specimens. The microstructural investigation of creep tested P 91 weld metal revealed two primary modes of <b>creep</b> <b>fractures.</b> In addition to <b>creep</b> <b>fractures</b> along columnar grain boundaries (typical of weld metal <b>creep</b> failure), <b>creep</b> <b>fractures</b> were also found along creep-weak white-bands which had formed at the inter-bead boundaries. The white-band regions consisted of material where the M 23 C 6 carbides had dissolved during creep testing; the loss of carbides had allowed recrystallisation of the martensitic structure to ferrite and consequently this material was much softer than the bulk weld metal. The element mapping over the weld metal by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) demonstrated that there was significant inhomogeneity {{in the distribution of}} certain elements, most significantly, chromium, manganese and molybdenum. This inhomogeneity resulted in strong activity gradients in carbon (even though the carbon concentration was homogeneous following welding) resulting in carbon loss from the alloy-depleted regions, the associated dissolution of carbides and the recrystallisation that accompanied this, and thus the poor mechanical properties which resulted in creep failure. The inhomogeneity in the distribution of certain alloying elements can be partially attributed to the solute partition of alloying elements during weld solidification which has been confirmed with examination of simulation P 91 TIG welds. However, the homogeneity of weld metal in this case required mixing of a base steel (the core rod in the weld consumable) and particles of various ferro-alloys (delivered into the weld pool from the flux). It is argued that poor mixing in the stagnant layer (unmixed zone) at the solid-liquid interface during weld solidification also makes a significant contribution to the formation of alloy-depleted regions. The formation of white-bands has been modelled using Thermo-Calc based on the understanding of the formation mechanism involving solute partition and subsequent carbon diffusion out of the alloy-depleted region. A good correlation to experimental results has been shown in the prediction of limiting carbon concentration and M 23 C 6 carbide content in white-bands. In addition, it was also suggested that depletion of carbides and carbon are strongly linked and that depletion of alloying elements only above a critical value will result in total carbide loss and thus recrystallisation into a white-band...|$|R

To simulate the creep process up to fracture, a Monte Carlo model is developed which couples VBI with a statistical description of grain length.

40|$|AbstractCreep {{fracture}} of solids at high temperature {{is vital to}} applications of many advanced materials, {{but most of the}} previous works are performed within the frame of two-dimensional theory. By using the out-of-plane stress constraint factor Tz, here we derive out three-dimensional asymptotic fields near the border of mode-I through-thickness cracks in power law creeping solids. It is found that the asymptotic fields near the crack border are dominated by both Tz and C(t) integral. Detailed finite element analyses are carefully performed for single-edge cracked specimens and centre-cracked tension specimens to investigate the dominance of the asymptotic solution for the crack border fields. It is shown that the C(t) −Tz description based on the obtained three-dimensional asymptotic solution can provide efficient prediction for the tensile stress ahead of the crack front under small scale creep condition. Under extensive creep conditions, a third parameter Q∗ should be introduced to take into account of the loss in the in-plane constraint caused by in-plane geometries and loading configuration at extensive creeping, and a three-parameter C(t) −Tz−Q∗ description is proposed and proven to be efficient to predict the tensile stress on the ligament ahead of the crack for both specimens.

40|$|Deep {{geothermal}} {{from the}} hot crystalline basement has remained an unsolved frontier for the geothermal industry for the past 30 years. This poses the challenge for developing a new unconventional geomechanics approach to stimulate such reservoirs. While {{a number of new}} unconventional brittle techniques are still available to improve stimulation on short time scales, the astonishing richness of failure modes of longer time scales in hot rocks has so far been overlooked. These failure modes represent a series of microscopic processes: brittle microfracturing prevails at low temperatures and fairly high deviatoric stresses, while upon increasing temperature and decreasing applied stress or longer time scales, the failure modes switch to transgranular and intergranular <b>creep</b> <b>fractures.</b> Accordingly, fluids play an active role and create their own pathways through facilitating shear localization by a process of time-dependent dissolution and precipitation creep, rather than being a passive constituent by simply following brittle fractures that are generated inside a shear zone caused by other localization mechanisms. We lay out a new theoretical approach for the design of new strategies to utilize, enhance and maintain the natural permeability in the deeper and hotter domain of geothermal reservoirs. The advantage of the approach is that, rather than engineering an entirely new EGS reservoir, we acknowledge a suite of creep-assisted geological processes that are driven by the current tectonic stress field.
