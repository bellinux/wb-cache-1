5|$|Escher's {{later work}} Four Regular Solids (Stereometric Figure) {{returned}} {{to the theme of}} polyhedral compounds, depicting a more explicitly Keplerian form in which the <b>compound</b> <b>of</b> the cube and octahedron is nested within the <b>compound</b> <b>of</b> the dodecahedron and icosahedron.|$|E
5|$|The stella octangula, a <b>compound</b> <b>of</b> two tetrahedra {{that appears}} in the upper right of Stars, also forms the central shape of another of Escher's astronomical works, Double Planetoid (1949).

5|$|The print {{depicts a}} hollowed-out <b>compound</b> <b>of</b> three octahedra, a {{polyhedral}} compound composed of three interlocking regular octahedra, floating in space.

The smaller polyhedra visible within the print also include all of the five Platonic solids and the rhombic dodecahedron. In order to depict polyhedra accurately, Escher made models of them from cardboard.|$|E

40|$|ON THE ORIGIN OF THE NOUN COMPOUNDS IN OLD PRUSSIAN Summary The article {{deals with}} the origin <b>of</b> the noun <b>compounds</b> <b>of</b> the Elbing Vocabulary and the Third Catechism. It {{establishes}} {{that more than a}} half <b>of</b> the noun <b>compounds</b> <b>of</b> the Elbing Vocabulary and only three noun <b>compounds</b> <b>of</b> the Third Catechism are of Old Prussian origin. The remaining <b>compounds</b> <b>of</b> the Elbing Vocabulary and the majority of those in the Third Catechism are loan translations from German. The noun <b>compounds</b> <b>of</b> the Elbing Vocabulary obviously tend to have simple base words. Except for a few questionable examples, there are no case compounds in the Elbing Vocabulary — all of them may be termed as stem compounds. However the <b>compounds</b> <b>of</b> the Third Catechism follow a clear trend of being comprised of underlying derivatives as well as having a case form for the first constituent. The German influence on the <b>compounds</b> <b>of</b> the Elbing Vocabulary is not very strong — it has impacted it only on the lexical level, while the <b>compounds</b> <b>of</b> the Third Catechism have also undergone more radical changes on the structural level. According to the above-mentioned features, it can be stated that the noun <b>compounds</b> <b>of</b> the Elbing Vocabulary resemble Lithuanian ones, while those of the Third Catechism show similarities with Latvian compounds which are influenced by German to a fairly large extent. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of a low temperature kinetic method for the flash photolysis <b>of</b> the <b>compounds</b> <b>of</b> membrane-bound cytochrome a 3 with carbon monoxide {{in the presence of}} oxygen affords evidence for three categories <b>of</b> functional intermediate <b>compounds</b> <b>of</b> cytochrome a 3 and oxygen.

5|$|Proto-Germanic *xalja-wītjan (or *halja-wītjan) is reconstructed from Old Norse hel-víti 'hell', Old English helle-wíte 'hell-torment, hell', Old Saxon helli-wīti 'hell', and the Middle High German {{feminine}} noun helle-wīze. The compound is a <b>compound</b> <b>of</b> *xaljō (discussed above) and *wītjan (reconstructed from forms such as Old English witt 'right mind, wits', Old Saxon gewit 'understanding', and Gothic un-witi 'foolishness, understanding').|$|E

5|$|The word mermaid is a <b>compound</b> <b>of</b> the Old English mere (sea), and maid (a girl {{or young}} woman). The {{equivalent}} term in Old English was merewif.

5|$|Boron nitride is a heat- and {{chemically}} resistant refractory <b>compound</b> <b>of</b> boron and nitrogen with the chemical formula BN. It exists in various crystalline forms that are isoelectronic to a similarly structured carbon lattice. The hexagonal form corresponding to graphite {{is the most}} stable and soft among BN polymorphs, and is therefore used as a lubricant and an additive to cosmetic products. The cubic (sphalerite structure) variety analogous to diamond is called c-BN; it is softer than diamond, but its thermal and chemical stability is superior. The rare wurtzite BN modification is similar to lonsdaleite and may even be harder than the cubic form.|$|E
5|$|Ceria is {{the most}} widely used <b>compound</b> <b>of</b> cerium. The main {{application}} of ceria is as a polishing compound, for example in chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP). In this application, ceria has replaced other metal oxides for the production of high-quality optical surfaces. Major automotive applications for the lower sesquioxide are as a catalytic converter for the oxidation of CO and NOx emissions in the exhaust gases from motor vehicles, Cerium(IV) sulfate is used as an oxidising agent in quantitative analysis. Cerium(IV) in methanesulfonic acid solutions is applied in industrial scale electrosynthesis as a recyclable oxidant. Ceric ammonium nitrate is used as an oxidant in organic chemistry and in etching electronic components, and as a primary standard for quantitative analysis.|$|E
5|$|Compounding in Khmer is {{a common}} derivational process that takes two forms, {{coordinate}} compounds and repetitive compounds. Coordinate compounds join two unbound morphemes (independent words) of similar meaning to form a compound signifying a concept more general than either word alone. Coordinate compounds join either two nouns or two verbs. Repetitive compounds, {{one of the most}} productive derivational features of Khmer, use reduplication of an entire word to derive words whose meaning will depend on the class of the reduplicated word. A repetitive <b>compound</b> <b>of</b> a noun indicates plurality or generality while that of an adjectival verb could mean either an intensification or plurality.|$|E

5|$|Copernicium is {{calculated}} to have several properties {{that differ from}} its lighter homologues in group 12, zinc, cadmium and mercury; due to relativistic effects, it may even give up its 6d electrons instead of its 7s ones.

Sizeable amounts of these elements were produced only in 1958 (Burris B. Cunningham and Stanley G. Thomson), and the first californium compound (0.3µg of CfOCl) was obtained only in 1960 by B. B.
