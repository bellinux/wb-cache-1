40|$|A {{framework}} for clustered-dot color halftone watermarking is proposed. Watermark patterns {{are embedded in}} the color halftone on per-separation basis. For typical CMYK printing systems, common desktop RGB <b>color</b> <b>scanners</b> are unable to provide the individual colorant halftone separations, which confounds per-separation detection methods. Not only does the K colorant consistently appear in the scanner channels as it absorbs uniformly across the spectrum, but cross-couplings between CMY separations are also observed in the <b>scanner</b> <b>color</b> channels due to unwanted absorptions. We demonstrate that by exploiting spatial frequency and color separability of clustered-dot color halftones, estimates of the individual colorant halftone separations {{can be obtained from}} scanned RGB images. These estimates, though not perfect, allow per-separation detection to operate efficiently. The efficacy of this methodology is demonstrated using continuous phase modulation for the embedding of per-separation watermarks...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{spectral}} characterization for <b>color</b> <b>scanners</b> {{by the use}} of adaptive estimation is proposed. It deals with estimation of high-dimensional reflectance vectors from low-dimensional scanner response vectors when the scanner departs from linearity. We first investigate the spectral linearity of the scanner, and then estimate the spectral reflectance adaptively based on the local statistics of a set of neighboring training samples. As the proposed characterization method does not utilize the mathematically recovered spectral responsivity, its inherent inaccuracy is not critical to the spectral characterization. Experimental results showed significant advantage of adaptive estimation when compared with other methods. Institute of Textiles and ClothingAuthor name used in this publication: John H. xi...|$|R

40|$|Device {{independent}} color {{requires that}} all color imaging devices speak in CIE colorimetric terms. A <b>color</b> image <b>scanner</b> is {{one component of}} the desktop color imaging chain {{that needs to be}} colorimetric if color is to be device independent. Most commercial <b>color</b> <b>scanners</b> are not colorimetric. Instead, they are built as color den-sitometers, emulating commercial graphic arts scanners. There are a wide variety of spectral response options if the design goal is a colorimetric scanner. This paper explores almost color mixture spectral response options using Neugebauers Colorimetric Quality Factor (CQF) as a design merit function. A set of empirical equations relating the average CIEL*a*b * color difference to the CQF under three CIE illuminants (A, F 2 and D 65) is de-veloped, based on a database of over 1000 colors representing a wide variety of colorants and color imaging technologies. Our goal is to empirically bridge this gap between the CQF specification for each channel and the scanners colorimetric performance, in terms of CIEL*a*b * color difference. For spectral response functions that have a high CQF, a universal transformation matrix is described for transforming almost colorimetric scanner RGB data to approximate CIE XYZ tristimulus data. Scanner peak wavelength and bandwidth require-ments for colorimetric and densitometric applications are also reported...|$|R

5000|$|Remote sensing {{of ocean}} colour from space began in 1978 with the {{successful}} launch of NASA's Coastal Zone <b>Color</b> <b>Scanner</b> (CZCS). Despite {{the fact that}} CZCS was an experimental mission intended to last only one year, the sensor continued to generate a valuable time-series of data over selected test sites until early 1986. Ten years passed before other sources of ocean-colour data became available with the launch of other sensors, {{and in particular the}} Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) in 1997 on board the NASA SeaStar satellite. Subsequent sensors have included NASA's Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Aqua and Tearra satellites, ESA's MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) onboard its environmental satellite Envisat. Several new ocean-colour sensors have recently been launched, including the Indian Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM-2) on-board ISRO's Oceansat-2 satellite and the Korean Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), which is the first ocean colour sensor to be launched on a geostationary satellite, and Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard NASA's Suomi NPP [...] More ocean colour sensors are planned over the next decade by various space agencies.|$|E
