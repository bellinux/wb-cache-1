40|$|Activity-dependent {{refinement}} of neural circuits {{is a fundamental}} principle of neural development. This process has been well studied at retinogeniculate synapses—synapses that form between retinal ganglion <b>cells</b> (RGCs) and <b>relay</b> <b>cells</b> within the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. Physiological studies suggest that shortly after birth, inputs from ∼ 20 RGCs converge onto <b>relay</b> <b>cells.</b> Subsequently, all but just one to two of these inputs are eliminated. Despite widespread acceptance, this notion {{is at odds with}} ultrastructural studies showing numerous retinal terminals clustering onto <b>relay</b> <b>cell</b> dendrites in the adult. Here, we explored this discrepancy using brainbow AAVs and serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM). Results with both approaches demonstrate that terminals from numerous RGCs cluster onto <b>relay</b> <b>cell</b> dendrites, challenging the notion that only one to two RGCs innervate each <b>relay</b> <b>cell.</b> These findings force us to re-evaluate our understanding of subcortical visual circuitry...|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} thalamic nuclei have been recognized: first order, which relay {{information}} from subcortical sources, and higher order, which may relay information from one cortical area to another. We have recently shown that muscarinic agonists depolarize all first order and most higher order <b>relay</b> <b>cells</b> but hyperpolarize {{a significant proportion}} of higher order <b>relay</b> <b>cells.</b> We now extend this result to serotonergic agonists, using rat thalamic brain slices and whole-cell, current- and voltage-clamp recordings from <b>relay</b> <b>cells</b> in various first order (the lateral geniculate nucleus, the ventral posterior nucleus, and the ventral portion of the medial geniculate body) and higher order nuclei (the lateral posterior, the posterior medial nucleus, and the dorsal portion of the medial geniculate body). Similar to the effects of muscarinic agonists, we found that first and most higher order <b>relay</b> <b>cells</b> were depolarized by serotonergic agonists, but 15 % of higher order <b>relay</b> <b>cells</b> responded with hyperpolarization. Thus different subsets of higher order <b>relay</b> <b>cells</b> are hyperpolarized by these modulatory systems, which could have implications for the transfer of information between cortical areas...|$|R

30|$|LSAS {{also allows}} the easy {{implementation}} of complex transmission and detection schemes, i.e., cooperative multipoint transmission and reception (CoMP). A virtual MIMO scheme exploiting LSAS is a promising technique which can considerably enhance the wireless backhaul performance. In this scheme proposed in [43], a high density of small cells are clustered where small cells are considered as cooperative relays (in LTE Advanced, decode-and-forward relaying is considered where the relay encodes and transmits the decoded {{data from the}} cell). The cooperative small <b>cell</b> <b>relays</b> {{in one of the}} clusters can form a virtual receiver with multiple receive antennas. Along with the macro BS that provides wireless backhaul to small cells, a virtual MIMO system is formed. The dimension of the virtual MIMO system can be increased by increasing the number of antennas at the macrocell BSs as well as increasing the number of small <b>cell</b> <b>relays</b> in a cluster. Employing LSAS at the macro BS will enhance the number of layers of the virtual MIMO system which in turn significantly improves the spectral efficiency of the system due to diversity in channel conditions, and therefore, backhaul is no longer a bottleneck to network performance.

5000|$|Thalamocortical <b>relay</b> <b>cells</b> (or {{principal}} neurons): The dendritic {{input to}} these cells comes from {{two sets of}} dendritic trees oriented on opposite poles of the cell.

40|$|Abstract—Thalamic <b>relay</b> <b>cells</b> express {{distinctive}} response modes {{based on}} the state of a low-threshold calcium channel (T-channel). When the channel is fully active (burst mode), the cell responds to inputs with a high-frequency burst of spikes; with the channel inactive (tonic mode), the cell responds at a rate proportional to the input. Due to the T-channel’s dynamics, we expect the cell’s response to become more nonlinear as the channel becomes more active. To test this hypothesis, we study the response of an in silico <b>relay</b> <b>cell</b> to Poisson spike trains. We first validate our model cell by comparing its responses with in vitro responses. To characterize the model cell’s nonlinearity, we calculate Poisson kernels, an approach akin to white noise analysis but using the randomness of Poisson input spikes instead of Gaussian white noise. We find that a <b>relay</b> <b>cell</b> with active T-channels requires at least a third-order system to achieve a characterization as good as a second-order system for a <b>relay</b> <b>cell</b> without T-channels.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that the main intrinsic electrophysiological properties of thalamocortical <b>relay</b> <b>cells,</b> production of a low threshold burst upon release from hyperpolarized potential and production of a train of single spikes following stimulation from depolarized potentials, can be readily modelled using a single compartment. There is, however, another less well explored intrinsic electrophysiological characteristic of <b>relay</b> <b>cells</b> for which models have not yet accounted: at somatic potentials near spike threshold, <b>relay</b> <b>cells</b> produce a fast ragged high threshold oscillation in somatic voltage. Optical [Ca 2 +] imaging and pharmacological tests indicate that this oscillation correlates with a high threshold Ca 2 + current in the dendrites. Here we present {{the development of a}} new compartment model of the thalamic <b>relay</b> <b>cell</b> guided by the simultaneous constraints that it must produce the familiar regular spiking relay mode and low threshold rebound bursts which characterize these cells, as well as the less-studied fast oscillation occurring at near-threshold somatic potentials. We arrive at a model cell which is capable of the production of isolated high threshold Ca 2 + spikes in distal branch segments, driven by a rapidly inactivating intermediate threshold Ca 2 + channel. Further, the model produces the low threshold spike behaviour of the <b>relay</b> <b>cell</b> without requiring high T-current density in the distal dendritic segments. The results thus support a new picture of the dendritic tree of <b>relay</b> <b>cells</b> which may have implications for the manner in which thalamic <b>relay</b> <b>cells</b> integrate descending input from the cortex...|$|R
40|$|SummaryGABAergic {{signaling}} {{is central}} to the function of the thalamus and has been traditionally attributed primarily to the nucleus reticularis thalami (nRT). Here we present a GABAergic pathway, distinct from the nRT, that exerts a powerful inhibitory effect selectively in higher-order thalamic relays of the rat. Axons originating in the anterior pretectal nucleus (APT) innervated the proximal dendrites of <b>relay</b> <b>cells</b> via large GABAergic terminals with multiple release sites. Stimulation of the APT in an in vitro slice preparation revealed a GABAA receptor-mediated, monosynaptic IPSC in <b>relay</b> <b>cells.</b> Activation of presumed single APT fibers induced rebound burst firing in <b>relay</b> <b>cells.</b> Different APT neurons recorded in vivo displayed fast bursting, tonic, or rhythmic firing. Our data suggest that selective extrareticular GABAergic control of <b>relay</b> <b>cell</b> activity will result in effective, state-dependent gating of thalamocortical information transfer in higher-order but not in first-order relays...|$|R
