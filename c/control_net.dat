5000|$|A T-spline surface can {{be thought}} of as a NURBS surface for which a row of control points is allowed to {{terminate}} without traversing the entire surface. The <b>control</b> <b>net</b> at a terminated row resembles the letter [...] "T". Modeling surfaces with T-splines can reduce the number of control points in comparison to NURBS surfaces and make pieces easier to merge, but increases the book-keeping effort to keep track of the irregular connectivity. T-splines can be converted into NURBS surfaces, by knot insertion, and NURBS can be represented as T-splines without T's or by removing knots. T-splines can therefore, in theory, do everything that NURBS can do. In practice, enormous amount of programming was required to make NURBS work as well as they do, and creating the equivalent T-Spline functionality would require similar effort. To smoothly join at points where more than three surface pieces meet, T-splines have been combined with geometrically continuous constructions of degree 3 by 3 (bi-cubic) and, more recently, of degree 4 by 4 (bi-quartic).|$|E
50|$|Although {{the first}} {{operational}} unit was delivered in May 1943, various bureaucratic problems led to it being delayed in {{being delivered to}} the front-line troops. The SCR-584 was first used in combat at Anzio in February 1944, where it {{played a key role}} in breaking up the Luftwaffe's concentrated air attacks on the confined beachhead. The SCR-584 was no stranger to the front, where it followed the troops, being used to direct aircraft, locate enemy vehicles (one radar is said to have picked up German vehicles at a distance of 26 kilometers), and track the trajectories of artillery shells, both to adjust the ballistic tables for the 90 millimeter guns, and to pinpoint the location of German batteries for counter-battery fire. After D-Day, the SCR-584 was used in the rapidly shifting very front lines to guide planes to their targets with increased accuracy. For example, the <b>Control</b> <b>Net</b> Systems Group of the 508th Sq of the 404th Fighter Bomber Group, 8th Air Force ran the SCR-584. From 14 Jul 1944 until 27 Oct 1944 they were attached to Sec 1 Co A, 555th Sig Aircraft Warning Battalion and served in fluid, forward positions.|$|E
5000|$|The 623D Air Control Squadron, traces {{its origins}} to the 305th Fighter Control Squadron (FCS), United States Army Air Forces. The 305th FCS was {{originally}} organized on 31 March 1943, then activated 1 April 1943 at Bradley Field, Connecticut, but not manned until 7 April (by temporary personnel from the 93rd Fighter Control Squadron, the unit responsible for training the 305th FCS). Permanent personnel began arriving on 10 April, and on 21 April the squadron’s commander arrived. All temporary personnel were released about this same time. By late August 1943 the 305th FCS was adequately manned to start operational training. While at Bradley Field, the 305th FCS {{served as the}} operational training unit for First Air Force's I Fighter Command. The 305th FCS provided fighter control training for single-engine P-47 Thunderbolt fighter groups, which obtained their new aircraft from the Republic Aviation production plant on Long Island prior to their deployment to overseas combat theaters. The 305th FCS accomplished the controlling of aircraft and furnishing homing facilities by means of semi-mobile VHF radio <b>control</b> <b>net</b> with stations located at various sites in Connecticut.The 305th FCS then moved to Blackstone Army Airfield, Virginia on 1 September 1943, where it again served as an operational training unit, this time for Third Air Force's III Fighter Command. The 305th FCS again provided fighter control training for newly arriving P-47 Thunderbolts and P-51 Mustangs as they became available. While controlling fighters in the Blackstone area, the 305th FCS conducted training with a signal air warning company and AAA battalions. The 305th FCS was alerted for an overseas move in October, but was subsequently removed from the list.After a short stint at Blackstone Army Airfield, the 305th FCS moved to Galveston Army Airfield, Texas on 20 December 1943. Here in Galveston the 305th FCS joined the 72nd Fighter Wing. This time the 305th FCS controllers were training the 2nd Air Force pilots on {{how to work with}} fighter control. [...] With its primary mission in Galveston, the 305th FCS sent detachments throughout the Second Air Force’s area to train fighter control missions. Four detachments went to Nebraska, another to Louisiana, and a sixth to another location in Texas. The squadron was alerted on 24 March 1944 for an overseas move, and in April all of the outlying detachments were pulled back to Galveston Army Airfield. The 305th FCS left Galveston Army Airfield on 3 May 1944 en route to Fort Lawton, Seattle, Washington.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{the problem of}} {{curvature}} behavior around extraordinary points of a Loop subdivision surface is addressed. For subdivision surfaces, configurations of the initial <b>control</b> <b>net</b> exist in which neither the elliptic nor the hyperbolic component of the initial <b>control</b> <b>net</b> becomes dominant. This leads to so-called hybrid shapes which often cause visible artifacts. A {{solution to this problem}} is to split it into two parts: first an eigenvalue tuning to allow for bounded Gauss curvature with arbitrary sign and, second, an eigencoefficient tuning to avoid hybrid shapes. The techniques for eigencoefficient tuning will now be analyzed in detail. The analysis allows to quan-tify the difference between the original and the modified surfaces. Additionally, extensions to the eigencoefficient tuning techniques are given to solve various problems that might be imposed by the topol-ogy of the initial <b>control</b> <b>net...</b>|$|E

40|$|Characterizing {{the linear}} and local linear {{independence}} of the functions that span a linear space is a key task if the space {{is to be used}} computationally. Given a <b>control</b> <b>net,</b> the spanning functions of one spatial coordinate of a generalized subdivision surface are called nodal functions. They are the limit, under subdivision, of associating the value one with one <b>control</b> <b>net</b> node and zero with all others. No characterization of independence of nodal functions has been published to date, even for the two most popular generalized subdivision algorithms, Catmull–Clark subdivision and Loop’s subdivision. This paper provides a road map for the verification of linear and local linear independence of generalized subdivision functions. It proves the conjectured global {{independence of the}} nodal functions of both algorithms, disproves local linear independence (for higher valences), and establishes linear independence on every surface region corresponding to a facet of the <b>control</b> <b>net.</b> Subtle exceptions, even to global independence, underscore the need for a detailed analysis to provide a sound basis for a number of recently developed computational approaches...|$|E
