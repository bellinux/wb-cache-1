6000|$|The lady {{remained}} there closeted with Mr. Musselboro {{for an hour}} after that, and did, I think, at length learn something more as {{to the details of}} her partner's business, than her faithful servant Mr. Musselboro had at first found himself able to give to her. And at last they came to friendly and confidential terms, in the midst of which the personal welfare of Mr. Dobbs Broughton was, I fear, somewhat forgotten. Not that Mr. Musselboro palpably and plainly threw his friend overboard. He took his friend's part,--alleging excuses for him, and pleading some facts. [...] "Of course, you know, a man like that is fond of pleasure, Mrs. Van Siever. He's been at it more or less all his life. I don't suppose he ever missed a Derby or an Oaks, or the cup at Ascot, or the Goodwood in his life." [...] "He'll have to miss them before long, I'm thinking," [...] said Mrs. Van Siever. [...] "And as to not <b>cashing</b> <b>up,</b> you must remember, Mrs. Van Siever, that ten per cent. won't come in quite as regularly as four or five. When you go for high interest, there must be hitches here and there. There must, indeed, Mrs. Van Siever." [...] "I know all about it," [...] said Mrs. Van Siever. [...] "If he gave it me {{as soon as he got}} it himself, I shouldn't complain. Never mind. He's only got to give me my little bit of money out of the business, and then he and I will be all square. You come and see Clara this evening, Gus." ...|$|E
5000|$|Around this time, {{the band}} also {{came up with}} their name with Batra going on to say, [...] "Actually we had already been {{thinking}} about what to call ourselves {{for a year and}} a bit more. Each of us decided to then come up with a list of names we thought as appropriate. We had about 500 ideas in there, but none really fit." [...] The story goes that while <b>cashing</b> <b>up</b> after a night out drinking, Manuel, who had quit the band earlier that day to concentrate on his DJ career, pulled out a receipt from a restaurant in Dublin, Ireland called 'Fire' lying on Dawson Street. [...] "Manu used to carry around tonnes of shit in his pockets. So while we were all done paying up that night, he was still taking out receipts and bills from months earlier. This one little piece of paper landed in front on us and it was from this restaurant. I think it summarized that period perfectly for us. The name was like his parting gift to us" [...] said Sonntag.|$|E
40|$|Some of {{the recent}} changes to {{employment}} legislation in New Zealand are working as intended, this report finds. Overview: This report provides a short-term evaluation of the 2010 amendments to the Employment Relations Act 2000 and Holidays Act 2003. The evaluation follows a mixed methods approach, based on qualitative interviews and quantitative survey data, and includes the following key areas of legislative change; 	allowing all employers the option to use trial periods 	changes to the Holidays Act (<b>cashing</b> <b>up</b> annual holidays, transferring public holidays, payment for some holidays and leave and providing proof of sickness) 	making union access to workplaces conditional on employer consent, and 	changes in provisions relating to employment problem resolution. For trial periods, some {{of the benefits of}} extending coverage to all businesses identified included reduced risk when hiring new people, greater flexibility, ease and security of use and some cost savings for employers. The report shows that extending the use of trial periods to all employers has resulted in more employment opportunities, with one third of employers surveyed saying the provision has led to them hiring people they otherwise wouldn’t have. For the Holidays Act amendments, benefits included greater flexibility and increased choices for some employers and employees. In some cases the evaluation found that the successful uptake of the changes has been affected by variable levels of understanding and difficulty applying the changes. For example, employers are finding that some Holidays Act provisions are still difficult to apply in some work arrangements, such as for people with variable work hours...|$|E
