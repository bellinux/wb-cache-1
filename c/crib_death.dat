5000|$|Frank Stanford's {{legacy is}} one {{shrouded}} in (and perhaps tainted by) legend, mystification, and inaccuracies.

Israeli government officials, eager not to further provoke Hebron Arabs, refused permission... On the day of the funeral, Israeli soldiers blocked the road to the Hebron cemetery. After more than an hour of waiting, Sarah Nachshon wearied of the impasse... Returning to her car, she cradled her dead son in her arms and began to walk past the military blockade... several soldiers, moved by a grieving mother's unyielding determination, volunteered to drive her... Following the burial, the community made efforts to clean up the cemetery. Prof. Ben Zion Tavger, a Russian-Jewish physicist and refusenik who moved to Hebron initiated the refurbishing efforts in the mid 1970s. In time, refurbished tombstones were installed bearing the names of original community members. Since then the site has both attracted visitors from around Israel as well as being targeted by vandalism.The cemetery also contains four mass graves with the remains of 59 victims of the 1929 Hebron massacre. A corner of the cemetery contains the remains of several Torah scrolls and Jewish prayer books which were torn up and set alight on the eve of Yom Kippur on October 3, 1976, at the Cave of the Patriarchs by rioters.Every year hundreds of members of the Chabad Lubavitch hasidic movement attend the anniversary of the passing of Menucha Rochel Slonim, a granddaughter of the founder of Chabad, Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi and a matriarch of the Hebron Jewish community.

Before the careful use of necropsies was instituted in the investiga-tion of cases of unexplained deaths, sudden infant deaths were most commonly blamed on mechanical suffocation from pillows, blankets, or “overlaying ” adults. The lack of significant pathologic evidence in the majori-ty of cases brought the asphyxiation theory into serious question. In its place, several hy-potheses were advanced; among the more significant were respiratory infection (1), an-tigen hypersensitivity (2), parathyroid mal-functioning (3), cervical spine injury (4), and cardiac arrhythmias or conduction distur-bances (5).

Yet despite advances in maternal-infant care, sudden intrauterine unexplained/unexpected death syndrome (SIUDS), has a six-eightfold greater incidence than that of SIDS. Frequent congenital abnormalities, likely morphological substrates for SIDS-SIUDS, were detected, mainly represented by alterations of the cardiac conduction system, such as accessory pathways and abnormal resorptive degeneration, and hypoplasia/agenesis of the vital brainstem structures. On the basis of these considerations, the new common definition of the SIDS-SIUDS complex is The sudden death of a fetus after the 25 th gestational week or infant under one year of age which is unexpected by history and remains unexplained after a thorough case investigation, including examination of the death scene, performance of a general autopsy and examination of the fetal adnexa.
