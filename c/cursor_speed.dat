For example, the scanning {{speed of the}} cursor cannot be too fast (users would not {{have enough time to}} respond correctly) nor too slow (users would have to wait unnecessarily for the cursor to reach a desired item). Francis and Johnson (2011) showed that character placement on a switch virtual keyboard can be treated as a mathematical optimization problem with a trade-off between speed and accuracy. They also proposed an algorithm to design a keyboard that optimized the <b>cursor</b> <b>speed</b> for a given desired accuracy.|$|E
40|$|As larger {{displays}} {{become more}} available {{their lack of}} adequate input techniques become apparent. In this paper we show the scalability of the dynamic size and <b>speed</b> <b>cursor</b> for large, high-resolution displays. We introduce {{the idea of a}} dynamic paradigm for input devices, explain three implementations of the dynamic size and <b>speed</b> (DSS) <b>cursor</b> and explain results of an experiment. In our experiment we compared the three different implementations of the dynamic size and <b>speed</b> <b>cursor</b> to cursor warping and standard cursor settings. In the experiment we found gender bias for two different tasks (clicking and simple drag and drop), found that one of the dynamic size and <b>speed</b> <b>cursor</b> implementations generally outperformed cursor warping and the standard cursor setting, and explain how distance to and size of targets effected results. We conclude by suggesting the use of a dynamic size and <b>speed</b> <b>cursor</b> with large, high-resolution displays. Author Keywords input techniques, dynamic, large display...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} kinematic templates, an end-user {{tool for}} defining content-specific motor space manipulations {{in the context}} of editing 2 D visual compositions. As an example, a user can choose the “sandpaper ” template to define areas within a drawing where cursor movement should slow down. Our current implementation provides templates that amplify or dampen the <b>cursor’s</b> <b>speed,</b> attenuate jitter in a user’s movement, guide movement along paths, and add forces to the cursor. Multiple kinematic templates can be defined within a document, with overlapping templates resulting in a form of function composition. A template’s strength can also be varied, enabling one to improve one’s strokes without losing the human element. Since kinematic templates guide movements, rather than strictly prescribe them, they constitute a visual composition aid that lies between unaided freehand drawing and rigid drawing aids such as snapping guides, masks, and perfect geometric primitives.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} kinematic templates, end-user drawing {{tools that}} influence the mouse cursor's movement within specific areas of a digital canvas. Two types of kinematic templates influence the cursor's movement: passive and active templates. Passive templates modify existing movement received from a pointing device to change the <b>cursor's</b> <b>speed</b> or direction of one's stroke. Active templates add movement to the cursor without movement from the pointing device. Since templates are provided as user-specified regions, these regions {{can be associated with}} areas of detail and they can be overlapped as a means of function composition. [¶] A kinematic template can be configured to improve upon one's freehand output without producing perfect output. Since templates do not necessarily prescribe geometric output, they constitute a visual composition aid that lies between unaided freehand drawing and drawing aids such as snapping constraints and perfect geometric primitives. [¶] Since kinematic templates can improve upon the consistency of one's strokes, it is beneficial for drawing visual styles such as hatching (an artistic effect that adds depth to a drawing with uniform strokes drawn in close proximity) and repetitive patterns. Since kinematic templates do not prescribe a type of output, one can "fight against" a template's preferred path of movement and discover unexpected, serendipitous outcomes...|$|R

The radius of curvature of the cursor path and the <b>cursor</b> <b>speed</b> along the path can capture differences in cursor movements that might be lost in a single measure such as time to target.

40|$|Work-related stress has the {{potential}} to increase the risk of chronic stress, major depression and other non-communicable diseases. Organizational stress monitoring usually applies long-term self-report instruments that are designed in a retrospective manner, and thus, is obtrusive, time-consuming and, most important, fails to detect and predict short-term episodes of stress. To address this shortcoming, we apply design science research with the goal to design, implement and evaluate a stress management service for knowledge workers (stressOUT) that senses the degree of work-related stress solely based on mouse movements. Using stress theory as justificatory knowledge, we implemented stressOUT that tracks mouse movements and perceived stress levels randomly twice a day with the goal to learn features of mouse movements that are related to stress perceptions. Results of a first longitudinal field study indicate that mouse <b>cursor</b> <b>speed</b> is negatively related to perceived stress. Future work is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- For the disabled, Microsoft has {{provided}} eight keys {{on the keyboard}} to direct {{the movements of the}} mouse cursor in the Windows Operating System. However, using them is uncomfortable because they are small, poorly located and moved slowly. This study proposes a faster switch-control computer input device using the method of two-grade movement mode, rather than that of Microsoft; this device has other additional functions to help users easily access the computer. The device has 15 switch-sockets. Eight switch-sockets are utilized to control the direction of motion and seven switch-sockets provide additional functions. The structure of this device-which allows users to create operating platforms that fit their requirements; to choose the number of required switches; to locate the switches and establish the movement speed- is an open and human interface. Six users without physical disabilities and two physically challenged users tested the device. Experimental results reveal that the average time taken using the proposed device was faster than that using the Microsoft Windows method by a factor of 6. 17 - 12. 58. Furthermore, the users can combine the proposed device with the speed function-key for a given far target to get the <b>cursor</b> <b>speed</b> improved by 43 %...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was a work-psychological {{evaluation}} of notebook-input devices, touchpad and trackpoint, {{in the framework of}} human-computer interaction. The focus of the studies conducted was on effects of differential user characteristics on the usability of notebook input devices. Additionally, essential variables of human-computer interaction were under survey, e. g., specific aspects of hardware design or input task. The research was based on fundamental psychological concept and theories (e. g., Fitts, 1954; Heuer, 1983; Meyer et al., 1988). Thus, the more practical approach of the past was offered a theoretical framework. First, an objective and standardized test was developed (cp., DIN EN ISO 9241 - 9, 2000) as well as a survey for the assessment of musculoskeletal discomfort (Sutter & Ziefle, 2003 a). Second, the evaluation of both input devices was undertaken with motor performance measures, and ratings of preference and discomfort. The results show distinct differences between the usability of touchpad and trackpoint. The touchpad (easier spatial transformation) was used more efficient compared to the trackpoint (more difficult spatial transformation). Responsible for the performance discrepancy is the spatial transformation: Cursor movements are optimised when executed with the touchpad. Performance decreased because of an inefficient cursor adjustment and -control with the trackpoint. In the meaning of the anticipation of action effects (e. g., James, 1890), the manipulation of the trackpoint follows in fact psychomotor laws. Nevertheless, beyond motor factors further cognitive aspects have to be addressed for an alternative behaviour model. Expertise, age and musculoskeletal discomfort were found to be critical user characteristics. They all have a strong impact on the handling of notebook input devices. It was found that the efficiency of the input device usage increased through practice and high expertise. Moreover, age, and the resulting increase and decrease of psychomotor skills over lifespan respectively, is an important factor for the usability of notebook input devices. Performance of children (11 years of age) and middle-aged adults (50 years) differed distinctly from the “best case”, young adult users (20 years). Both age groups performed less efficient, but they compensated very well the developmental lack by practice and experience. The repetitive usage of notebook input devices, and the appearance and impact of musculoskeletal discomfort was under study. Even young and healthy users show to have an increase of discomfort in finger and hand after several hours of exposure. This was found for both input devices likewise. The focussing of discomfort on finger and hand must be discussed in relation to repetitive strain injuries and their development. Musculoskeletal impaired users reported specific discomfort locations compared to healthy users. Users, who formerly suffered from RSI but were free of symptoms for several years, felt strong discomfort when exposed to input devices (cp., Sorgatz, 2002). The manipulation of both notebook input devices was heavily limited, e. g. work and rest periods were by 3 times higher compared to healthy users. The analyses of human-computer interaction revealed a variety of optimisation options, independently from user characteristics. The usage is best for input devices with easy spatial transformation (touchpad) in combination with a high <b>cursor</b> <b>speed.</b> Input devices with more difficult transformations (trackpoint) will profit from low <b>cursor</b> <b>speed.</b> This will gain a better cursor adjustment and – control. The analysis of work organisation showed that human-computer interaction was remarkably improved by button use strategy (two-handed), task type (point-click task) and task difficulty (large and close targets). This was found for both input devices. In general, the touchpad was found to be an effective and multi-purpose applicable input device. Its usability is only marginally affected by the user characteristics investigated. In contrast to the trackpoint the usage of the touchpad is recommended thoroughly for all user groups under survey...|$|E
40|$|Most {{models of}} {{auditory}} word recognition describe the activation of lexical items {{in a continuous}} and graded manner. Much evidence in favor of these models comes from the visual-world paradigm, using either eye fixations or computer cursor trajectories as dependent measures. In particular, Spivey, Grosjean and Knoblich (2005) relied on their observation of unimodality {{in the distribution of}} cursor trajectories to argue in favor of a single cognitive process consistent with a continuous model of lexical activation. The present study addresses two questions: (1) whether the logic of inferring the number of cognitive processes from distributional analyses can be extended to a different dependent variable – reaction times, and (2) how robust the distribution of cursor trajectories is to changes in <b>cursor</b> <b>speed</b> (mouse gain). In Experiment 1, eye movements and reaction times were recorded in a visual-world paradigm and reaction times were modeled using ex-Gaussian curve-fitting. Participants responded slower to trials with a phonological competitor presented alongside the target than to trials with a control image presented alongside the target. Crucially, this difference was manifested as a shifting of the distribution rather than as a skewing of the distribution and lends additional support for a continuous model of lexical activation. Experiment 2 measured eye and mouse movements concurrently in a similar visual-world task to investigate the relationship between these two dependent measures {{at the level of the}} individual trial. In addition, Experiment 2 manipulated the speed of the cursor (mouse gain) between subjects. The low mouse gain served to reduce the effect of phonological competition. Moreover, the shape of the distribution of cursor trajectories across phonological competitor and control conditions was indistinct with low mouse gain, while the shape of the distributions across the two conditions differed with high mouse gain. This effect of mouse gain shows that the distribution of cursor trajectories is not robust to changes in mouse gain. Moreover, it raises questions about the strength of the linking hypothesis necessary to interpret the distribution of cursor trajectories...|$|E

40|$|Emotion can {{influence}} important user behaviors, including purchasing decisions, technology use, and customer loyalty. The ability to easily assess users' emotion during live system use therefore has practical {{significance for the}} design and improvement of information systems. In this paper, we discuss using human-computer interaction input devices to infer emotion. Specifically, we utilize attentional control theory to explain how movement captured via a computer mouse (i. e., mouse cursor movements) can be a real-time indicator of negative emotion. We report three studies. In Study 1, an experiment with 65 participants from Amazon's Mechanical Turk, we randomly manipulated negative emotion and then monitored participants' mouse cursor movements as they completed a number-ordering task. We found that negative emotion increases the distance and reduces the <b>speed</b> of mouse <b>cursor</b> movements during the task. In Study 2, an experiment with 126 participants from a U. S. university, we randomly manipulated negative emotion and then monitored participants' mouse cursor movements while they interacted with a mock e-commerce site. We found that mouse <b>cursor</b> distance and <b>speed</b> {{can be used to}} infer the presence of negative emotion with an overall accuracy rate of 81. 7 percent. In Study 3, an observational study with 80 participants from universities in Germany and Hong Kong, we monitored mouse cursor movements while participants interacted with an online product configurator. Participants reported their level of emotion after each step in the configuration process. We found that mouse <b>cursor</b> distance and <b>speed</b> can be used to infer the level of negative emotion with an out-of-sample R- 2 of 0. 17. The results enable researchers to assess negative emotional reactions during live system use, examine emotional reactions with more temporal precision, conduct multimethod emotion research, and create more unobtrusive affective and adaptive systems...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} visual feedback effects and human performance in the foot mouse control. Background: Generally, computer mouse tasks are controlled by visual feedback. In order to understand the characteristics of a foot mouse control, it is important to investigate the patterns of visual feedback involved in foot-mouse control tasks. Human performance of foot mouse control is also an important factor to understand the foot mouse control. Method: Three types of mouse control were determined to investigate visual feedback effects and human performance in the foot mouse control. Visual feedback effects in the foot mouse control were compared with those of a typical hand mouse. The <b>cursor</b> movement <b>speed</b> and mental workload were measured in the three types of tasks and two types of mouses. Results: Mouse control tasks with an element of homing-in to the target were more quickly performed by the hand mouse than the foot mouse. Mental workload was also higher in the foot mouse than the hand mouse. However, in the steering movement, human performance of the foot mouse control was not lower than that of the hand mouse control. Visual feedback in the foot mouse control was less required than in the hand mouse control. Conclusion: The foot mouse was not efficient in the most mouse control tasks, compared to the hand mouse. However, the foot mouse was efficient in the steering movement, moving...|$|R
