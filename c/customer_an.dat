5|$|In January 2014, hedge fund, activist {{investor}} and Juniper shareholder Elliott Associates advocated that Juniper {{reduce its}} cash reserves and cut costs, before Kheradpir was officially appointed. That February, Juniper {{reached an agreement}} with Elliott and other stakeholders for an Integrated Operating Plan (IOP) that involved repurchasing $2 billion in shares, reducing operating expenses by $160 million and appointing two new directors to its board. That April, 6% of the company's staff were laid off to cut expenses. In November 2014, Kheradpir unexpectedly resigned following a review by Juniper's board of directors regarding his conduct in a negotiation with an unnamed Juniper <b>customer.</b> <b>An</b> internal Juniper executive, Rami Rahim, took his place as CEO.|$|E

2500|$|Although de Havilland {{stated that}} they {{generally}} concurred with BEA, its management also {{stated that they}} had worked [...] "under terms more onerous than anything D.H. had previously undertaken". Industry observers at the time felt that the British aircraft industry had again stumbled [...] "into the pitfall of having designed exclusively for one <b>customer</b> <b>an</b> aeroplane that has potentially a much wider scope": a sentiment which would be echoed throughout the Trident's subsequent history. The de Havilland board elected to submit to BEA's demand, overriding input from its own sales and market research departments which indicated that other airlines sought the larger model instead. It was, however, noted that de Havilland had not yet secured a formal and final BEA order and that its competitor Bristol was actively promoting their 200 [...] project, which was significantly smaller than the D.H.121. At the time Boeing and Douglas were also downsizing their DC-9 and 727 projects. It was felt the original large D.H.121 would have to compete against the Convair 880 and Boeing 720 some four years after their service entries, whereas a cut-back design would be more competitive against the then-projected 75–100 seat, twin-engined DC-9.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "PCC" [...] in this car's {{name comes}} from {{the name of a}} design {{committee}} formed in 1929 as the [...] "Presidents' Conference Committee" [...] and renamed the [...] "Electric Railway Presidents' Conference Committee" [...] (ERPCC) in 1931. [...] This group's membership consisted mostly of representatives of some of the larger operators of urban electric street railways in the United States plus potential manufacturers. [...] Three interurban lines and at least one [...] "heavy rail," [...] or rapid transit, operator - the Chicago Rapid Transit Company - were represented as well. [...] Also included on the membership roll were manufacturers of surface cars (streetcars) and interested component suppliers. The ERPCC goal was to design a streamlined, comfortable, quiet, and fast accelerating and braking streetcar that would be operated by a seated operator utilizing floor mounted pedal controls to better {{meet the needs of the}} street railways and to better appeal to riders. [...] The committee prepared a detailed research plan, conducted extensive research on streetcar design, built and tested components, made necessary modifications and revisions based upon the findings, and, in the end, produced a set of specifications for a standardized and fixed design (albeit one with a modest list of available options with some room for customer customization) to be built with standard parts as opposed to a custom designed carbody with any variety of different parts added depending on the whims and requirements of the individual <b>customer.</b> <b>An</b> excellent product emerged, the PCC car, as was proved in later years by numerous national and international users.|$|E
