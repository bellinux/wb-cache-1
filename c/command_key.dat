2500|$|The Windows logo key (also {{known as}} Windows key, start key, logo key, flag key, super key, <b>command</b> <b>key,</b> flag or home) is a {{keyboard}} key which was originally introduced on the Microsoft Natural keyboard in 1994. This key became a standard key on PC keyboards. Tapping this key invokes the operating system's start menu, {{if it has}} one. In Windows, [...] performs the same function, in case the keyboard lacks this key.|$|E
5000|$|On a {{keyboard}} {{made with the}} Microsoft Windows logo, the Windows keys are identical in function to the Mac <b>Command</b> <b>keys,</b> as is the [...] key on a Sun or another Unix-oriented keyboard. Conversely, when an Apple USB keyboard is used with other operating systems, the <b>Command</b> <b>keys</b> function as Windows keys or Meta keys.|$|R

2500|$|The {{most widely}} used {{modifier}} keys include the Control key, Shift key and the Alt key. The AltGr key is used to access additional symbols for keys that have three symbols printed on them. On the Macintosh and Apple keyboards, the modifier keys are the Option key and <b>Command</b> <b>key,</b> respectively. On MIT computer keyboards, the Meta key {{is used as a}} modifier and for Windows keyboards, there is a Windows key. Compact keyboard layouts often use a Fn key. [...] "Dead keys" [...] allow placement of a diacritic mark, such as an accent, on the following letter (e.g., the Compose key).|$|E

5000|$|Keyboard: 56 keys, QWERTY layout {{with full}} {{standard}} spacing, 8 programmable function <b>keys,</b> 4 dedicated <b>command</b> <b>keys.</b> These last 12 are tactile [...] "button"-style keys. Almost all keys {{other than the}} 12 function keys are capable of rollover (without phantom keys appearing depressed), so multi-key combinations can be used.|$|R
2500|$|A {{computer}} keyboard comprises alphanumeric or character keys for typing, modifier keys for altering {{the functions of}} other keys, navigation keys for moving the text cursor on the screen, function <b>keys</b> and system <b>command</b> <b>keys</b> – such as [...] and [...] – for special actions, and often a numeric keypad to facilitate calculations.|$|R
5000|$|In many {{computer}} video games, {{the keyboard}} is used both for controlling {{the game and}} typing messages. A user may forget they are in [...] "typing mode" [...] {{as they attempt to}} react to something sudden in the game and find the controls unresponsive (and instead their text bar full of the <b>command</b> <b>keys</b> pressed).|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "open" [...] (hollow) and {{separate}} [...] "closed" [...] (solid) Apple logo keys on the Apple II series, served functions {{similar to that}} of the <b>Command</b> <b>key.</b> The open-Apple key was combined with the <b>Command</b> <b>key</b> on Apple Desktop Bus keyboards (which were used on both the Apple IIgs and several years of Macintosh models) where it remained after the Apple II line was discontinued.|$|E
5000|$|This {{application}} {{allows the}} operator to build screen formats or menus online. Screen formats {{are very much}} like what Visual Basic and Access call [...] "forms." [...] <b>Command</b> <b>keys</b> can be enabled/disabled. Input fields, output fields, and constants can be created and conditioned. Conditions (in RPG these are called indicators) can cause fields to disappear, change colors, and so forth.|$|R
25|$|Keyboards and keypads may be {{illuminated}} from inside, {{especially on}} equipment for mobile use. Illumination facilitates {{the use of}} the keyboard or keypad in dark environments. Some gaming keyboards have lighted keys, {{to make it easier for}} gamers to find <b>command</b> <b>keys</b> while playing in a dark room. Some keyboards may have small LED lights in a few important function keys, to remind users that the function is activated (see photo).|$|R

5000|$|The Compose Character key was {{introduced}} by engineers at Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) on the LK201 keyboard, available since 1983 with the VT220 terminal. The keyboard included an LED indicating that a Compose sequence is on-going. While the LK201 introduced the group of <b>command</b> <b>keys</b> between the alphanumerical block and the numerical keypad, and the [...] "inverted T" [...] arrangement of arrow keys, which have become standard, the compose key by contrast did not become a standard.|$|R
50|$|Inkscape {{provides}} mouse over tooltips {{and status}} bar hints for all buttons, controls, <b>commands,</b> <b>keys,</b> and on-canvas handles. The status bar hint messages are dynamic: A given object can display {{up to four}} hints while editing it with just one tool. The hints update based on two items—the tool being used, {{and the type of}} object/node/handle being edited—text, shapes, paths, node types, etc. It comes with a complete keyboard and mouse reference (in HTML and SVG) and several interactive tutorials in SVG.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} {{challenge for}} harnessing {{the power of}} a midrange computer is interacting with an online user and providing ease of use. So what if your customer file has a million records... can your computer operator find the right one quickly? Concepts such as ISAM (Indexed Sequential Access Method) have been around {{since the early days of}} computing. Using a display format, with colors, blinking fields, <b>command</b> <b>keys,</b> and scrolling functions, an operator can quickly adjust to advanced programs and become more effective.|$|R
5000|$|Delete/Backspace keys remove one {{character}} right/left of current caret position, while pressing {{them together with}} the Ctrl or <b>command</b> <b>key</b> removes one word.|$|E
5000|$|The Option key (⌥), for {{entering}} diacritics {{and other special}} characters. Like the Shift and Control keys, the Option key serves as a modifier for the <b>Command</b> <b>key</b> shortcuts, {{as well as being}} used to type many special characters. It serves the function of the solid-Apple key in Apple II applications. It functions as the Alt key in Unix and Windows environments. Compared to their equivalents on the standard IBM PC keyboard layout the <b>Command</b> <b>key</b> and the Option key are located in reverse order.|$|E
5000|$|On the NeXT ADB keyboard, the Command keys were {{replaced}} by keys labeled [...] and the <b>Command</b> <b>key</b> morphed into a wide Command bar {{in front of the}} space bar ...|$|E
50|$|Operator input was {{provided}} {{in the form of}} a box with 10 columns of digits in the center with buttons for each number from 0 to 10. A single column on the left was used to select an accumulator, and the other than to input the ten digit value. There was a row of <b>command</b> <b>keys</b> on the right. Output consisted of two ten-digit displays using nixie tubes on the front of the machine, which also featured a large electric clock.|$|R
5|$|While the MacBook Pro largely {{followed}} the industrial design standard {{set by the}} PowerBook G4, the MacBook was Apple's first notebook to use features now standard in its notebooks – the glossy display, the sunken keyboard design and the non-mechanical magnetic latch. With the late 2007 revision, the keyboard received several changes to closely mirror the one which shipped with the iMac, by adding the same keyboard short-cut to control multimedia, and removing the embedded numeric keypad and the Apple logo from the <b>command</b> <b>keys.</b>|$|R
50|$|All of the <b>key</b> <b>commands</b> can be {{customized}} in SpaceEngine's settings.|$|R
