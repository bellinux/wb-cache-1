40|$|Conventional {{methods for}} soil {{compaction}} mapping, such as penetrometers, although accurate, work as stop-and-go providing point measurements. This process is both time consuming and labour intensive. On-the-go electrical Conductivity (EC) measurements such as electromagnetic induction (e. g. EM 38) {{are affected by}} key soil properties including texture, moisture content and compaction, so offer a possible rapid alternative for compaction detection. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} work is the detection of the within-field variability of soil compaction using soil electrical conductivity for improved soil management. A methodology for identification of within-field variability and for comparison of the data collected by contact and contact-less EC sensors, soil compaction sensor (which contains of eight instrumented wedge faces attached to the leading edge of a tine) and cone penetrometer was developed and a randomised block design experiment was performed. The data was evaluated statistically, the maps of spatial variability were created and the areas for targeted soil loosening were determined. A key finding was the development of application maps for targeted soil loosening, based on soil electrical conductivity measurements. The practical utilisation of this method assumes the presence of two maps that would be compared. The initial map has to be created for the soil in desirable loosened conditions and will be used as a standard for further comparisons. Further map will characterize the conditions of the compacted soil. It is recommended that both maps would be obtained in similar conditions to minimize the effect of soil moisture. The application map can be then created either manually using visual comparison of both initial (loosened soil condition) and further map (compacted areas), or using an appropriate geostatistical tool, in this case a ratio of the two maps. It was found out that the EC readings collected by the <b>Conductometer</b> at depth range of 0 - 0. 3 m are able to distinguish the soil areas with no compaction above 0. 3 m and the soil compacted within whole profile. The EC readings obtained at depth range of 0 - 0. 9 m can distinguish the soil zones with no compaction above 0. 6 m {{from the rest of the}} field. Using the EC data obtained at both depth ranges it is possible to determine three different environments within the field: one with no compaction above 0. 3 m, one with no compaction above 0. 6 m and one containing the soil compacted within whole profile. The best results for determining the areas with different depths of soil compaction were obtained by soil compaction sensor and cone penetrometer. However the absolute values of soil compaction sensor were affected by small changes in soil texture. The slow data collection speed of point penetration resistance measurement technique practically limits the spatial resolution of final data set. The soil compaction sensor has to be attached on the frame of the subsoiler and although it provides precise readings, it has high energy requirement. The high labour and time requirements are the main disadvantages of penetration resistance measurements. Second most precise determination of the areas with different soil compaction presence was provided by the EC data collected by the <b>Conductometer</b> which is able to collect data on-the-go with much lower power requirements. EM 38 operated in horizontal mode distinguished the areas with no compaction above 0. 3 m and areas with soil compacted at whole profile with less precision. The same instrument operated in vertical mode was not sensitive enough to measure any differences in soil bulk density...|$|E

Minerals (Na + and K +), vitamin C and protein contents were also analyzed. Na + and K + were determined by Flame photometer and proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). The amount of sodium ranges from 0. 020 - 0. 039 %. The lowest value of sodium was found in Vangard and the highest in Cyclone.

The seeds were sterilized in 0.1 % HgCl 2 for 10  min, and pre-soaked in distilled water for 12  h for imbibition. The soaked seeds were sowed on six layers of wetted filter papers in trays (24  cm[*]×[*] 16  cm, approximately 300 seeds per tray) with covers and germinated at 26 °C in the dark for 2.5 d. After germination, the seedlings with unanimous growth were irrigated with 100  ml of 0 (control), 0.3, 0.6, 0.9 and 1.2  mM sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) (the pH of the solution was adjusted to 6.0 with 1  M HCl), a hydrogen sulfide donor (Lisjak et al., 2013; Wang, 2012; García-Mata and Lamattina, 2013) for 6  h (pretreatment with NaHS had no significant effect on the growth of seedlings).

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze the fresh honey after extracting and after half-year storage at room temperature. Overall, we {{analyzed}} 10 samples of rape (Brassica napus) honey coming from district Vranov nad Toplou located in the eastern Slovakia. The analysis consisted of the evaluation of the physico-chemical parameters (water content, free acidity and electrical conductivity) and microbiological evaluation (total plate count (TPC), counts of coliform bacteria, lactic acid bacteria, sporulating microorganisms and microscopic fungi). Water content, free acidity and electrical conductivity were measured according to IHC (2009), namely these parameters were detected by refractometer, titration and <b>conductometer,</b> respectively. We used dilution plating method for microbiological analysis. Fresh rape honey contained 18. 3 ± 1. 0 % of water. Free acidity of fresh rape honey was 12. 7 ± 2. 0 meq. kg - 1 and electrical conductivity was 0. 14 mS. cm - 1. After half a year of storage, water content and electrical conductivity decreased nonsignificantly and free acidity increased nonsignificantly. Stored honey samples meet the requirements of Decree 41 / 2012 and 106 / 2012. From microbiological point of view, fresh rape honey showed relatively high microbial counts. Mean values of TPC, sporulating microorganisms, lactic acid bacteria and yeasts exceeded 2. 00 log cfu/g. All spotted microbial groups decreased in the stored honey comparing with the fresh honey. We found significant (p ˂ 0. 01) differences of TPC, lactic acid bacteria and yeasts comparing the fresh and stored honey samples. Evaluating microbiological parameters, one sample of stored honey did not meet the requirements of Codex Alimentarius SR (2014). TPC exceeded the limit value. Based on the results we can conclude that all samples meet the requirements for good quality honey. Microbial counts in the honey decreased gradually. Probably, various microorganisms have important role in creation of the honey from the nectar of plants, but non-sporulating microorganisms die in the ripe honey. <! [...] [endif] [...] ...|$|E
