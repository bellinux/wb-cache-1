In the first half we study circles in a complex projective space and give a characterization of homogeneous real hypersurfaces in a complex projective space by using geometric properties of circles. In the latter half we study geodesics of geodesic spheres, which are the simplest real hypersurfaces in a complex projective space, and investigate their length spectrum in detail. Finally we characterize real and complex space forms {{from this point of}} view. 0. Introduction. The study of circles is one of the interesting objects in differential geometry.

Some basic algorithms are proposed, including the boost which bends a line to a <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> κ, and the twisted boost which generates the Hopf fibration. We investigate methods to control curvature in two orthogonal directions u and v and examine a few distance-based and linear weighting techniques for synthesizing sur-face patches using multiple curvature control points.

40|$|The {{notion of}} osculating circle (or <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature)</b> of a smooth plane curve is {{familiar}} to every student of calculus and elementary differential geometry: this is the circle that approximates the curve at a point better than all other circles. One may say that the osculating circle passes through three infinitesimally close points on the curve. More specifically, pick three points on the curve and draw a circle through these points. As the points tend to each other, there is a limiting position of the circle: this is the osculating circle. Its radius is the radius of curvature of the curve, and the reciprocal of the radius is the curvature of the curve. If both the curve and the osculating circle are represented locally as graphs of smooth functions then not only the values of these functions but also their first and second derivatives coincide {{at the point of}} contact. Ask your mathematical friend to sketch an arc of a curve and a few osculating circles. Chances are, you will see something like Figure 1. Figure 1 : Osculating circles? This is wrong! The following theorem was discovered by Peter Guthrie Tait in the end of the 19 th century [9] and rediscovered by Adolf Kneser early in the 20 th century [4].

40|$|Purpose: This book is {{intended}} to supplement our text, Calculus (Benjamin/Cummings, 1980), or virtually any other calculus text (see page vii, How To Use This Book With Your Calculus Text). As the title Calculus Unlimited implies, this text presents an alternative treatment of calculus using the method of exhaustion for the derivative and integral in place of limits. With the aid of this method, a definition of the derivative may be introduced in the first lecture of a calculus course {{for students who are}} familiar with functions and graphs. Approach: Assuming an intuitive understanding of real numbers, we begin in Chapter 1 with the definition of the derivative. The axioms for real numbers are presented only when needed, in the discussion of continuity. Apart from this, the development is rigorous and contains complete proofs. As you will note, this text has a more geometric flavor than the usual analytic treatment of calculus. For example, our definition of completeness is in terms of convexity rather than least upper bounds, and Dedekind cuts are replaced by the notion of a transition point. Who Should Use This Book: This book is for calculus instructors and students interested in trying an alternative to limits. The prerequisites are a knowledge of functions, graphs, high school algebra and trigonometry. How To Use This Book: Because the "learning-by-doing" technique introduced in Calculus has proved to be successful, we have adapted the same format for this book. The solutions to "Solved Exercises" are provided {{at the back of the}} book; however readers are encouraged to try solving each example before looking up the solution. The Origin Of The Definition of The Derivative: Several years ago while reading Geometry and the Imagination, by Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen (Chelsea, 1952, p. 176), we noticed a definition of the <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> for a plane curve C. No calculus, as such, was used in this definition. This suggested that the same concept could be used to define the tangent line and thus serve as a limit-free foundation for the differential calculus. We introduced this new definition of the derivative into our class notes and developed it in our calculus classes for several years. As far as we know, the definition has not appeared elsewhere. If our presumption of originality is ill-founded, we welcome your comments. Jerrold Marsden Alan Weinstein Berkeley, C...|$|E

40|$|Measurement <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> the flamefront of {{premixed}} turbulent flames {{is important}} for the validation of numerical models for combustion. In this work, curvature is measured from contours that outline the flamefront, which are generated from laser-induced fluorescence images. The contours are inherently digitized, resulting in pixelation effects that lead to difficulties in computing <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> the flamefront accurately. A common approach is to fit functions locally to short sections along the flame contour, and this approach is also followed in this work; the method helps smoothen the pixelation before curvature is measured. However, the length and degree of the polynomial, and hence the amount of smoothing, must be correctly set in order to maximize the precision and accuracy <b>of</b> the <b>curvature</b> measurements. Other researchers have applied polynomials of different orders and over different segment lengths to <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> known <b>curvature</b> as a test to determine the appropriate choice of polynomial; it is shown here that this method results in a sub-optimal choice of polynomial function. Here, we determine more suitable polynomial functions through use <b>of</b> a <b>circle</b> whose radius is sinusoidally modulated. We show that this leads to a more consistent and reliable choice for the local polynomial functions fitted to experimental data. A polynomial function thus determined is then applied to flame contour data to measure <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> experimentally acquired flame contours.
