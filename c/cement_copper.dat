50|$|Such oxide ores {{are usually}} leached by sulfuric acid, {{usually in a}} heap {{leaching}} or dump leaching process to liberate the copper minerals into a solution of sulfuric acid laden with copper sulfate in solution. The copper sulfate solution (the pregnant leach solution) is then stripped of copper via a solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX-EW) plant, with the barred (denuded) sulfuric acid recycled back on to the heaps. Alternatively, the copper can be precipitated out of the pregnant solution by contacting it with scrap iron; a process called cementation. <b>Cement</b> <b>copper</b> is normally less pure than SX-EW copper.

In this work, the leaching kinetics of malachite in ammonium sulfate solutions was investigated, and metallic copper was recovered by a cementation method from the resulting actual leach solution. Copper (II) oxide was prepared by an isothermal oxidation method from the <b>cement</b> <b>copper.</b> In the leaching experiments, the effects of reaction temperature, particle size, and stirring speed on copper leaching from malachite ore were studied. In the cementation experiments, metallic zinc was used as the reductant metal to recover the copper from the solution.

40|$|Copper slag is {{a massive}} {{metallurgist}} waste. Annual production rises up to 24. 6 million tons, approximately, and the main environmental impact derived from slag disposal is the usage of great soil extensions and the resulting visual contamination of the landscape. Along time, copper slag {{has been used in}} the manufacture of concrete and cement mortars. Thus, with the aim of verifying binder-type influence in the final hardness of mortars, two types of cement were used: regular cement and high initial resistance <b>cement.</b> <b>Copper</b> slag was characterized from the chemical, mineralogical and grading viewpoints. Official Chilean regulations were used in the applied methodology for the determination of some important slag parameters.

However, the grid system components will also consume {{a considerable amount of}} energy for its production. In fact, the manufacturing of <b>cement,</b> steel, <b>copper,</b> insulation materials and the other grid components can cause a much larger amount of CO 2 into the atmosphere, (Krauter and Ruther 2003). However, several other environmental challenges can be {{associated with the use of}} PV system components, mainly PV panels and batteries. The main environmental problems related to photovoltaic panels, if not properly disposed, are as follows: leaching of lead, leaching of cadmium, loss of conventional resources (primarily aluminum and glass) and loss of rare metals (silver, indium, gallium and germanium). These issues require more intense care during the recycling and disposal of PV system components. At the same time, rare metal recovery and component recycling is very essential for the durability of such materials in the natural cycle. The land required by PV arrays may sometimes take over natural life, through tree cutting or even soil desertification, and then the environmental aspects of this issue would have to be considered. In the case of this study, the available land is almost barren and lacks any form of natural life expect for some desert plants. Therefore, the effect on natural life can almost be discarded.|$|R
40|$|Copper slag is a {{by-product}} generated during smelting to extract copper metal from the ore. The copper slag obtained may exhibit pozzolanic activity and may therefore {{be used in}} the manufacture of addition-containing cements. In this paper the effect of the incorporation of the <b>copper</b> slag in <b>cement</b> is measured. Blends of copper slag with Portland cement generally possess properties equivalent to Portland cement containing fly ash, but very different to the silica fume incorporation. Copper slag and fly ash reduce the heat of hydration more effectively than silica fume in mortars. The replacement of 30 % <b>cement</b> by <b>copper</b> slag reduces the flexural and compressive strength in a similar way to fly ash; however, after 28 days, the reduction is less than the percentage of substitution. Hydrated calcium aluminate phases were analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The pozzolanic activity of copper slag {{is similar to that of}} fly ash and higher than silica fume. In the presence of low water/cement ratios, certain pozzolanic materials produce a very compact cement paste that limits the space available for hydration products, a determining factor in the formation of hydrated calcium aluminates.

40|$|Wire EDM is in {{use for a}} {{long time}} for cutting punches and dies, shaped pockets and other machine parts. Surface finish of the {{machined}} surface mainly depends on current and voltage used during machining. In the present research experimental investigations have been conducted to establish relationships of job surface finish with current and voltage. Brass wires of diameters 0. 3, 0. 25, 0. 20 and 0. 15 mm were used. Work materials tested were mild steel, aluminum, <b>cemented</b> carbide, <b>copper</b> and stainless steel. After machining each material with specific current and voltage the hardness and the job surface roughness were measured and their surfaces were observed under an electron-scanning microscope. Results of the experiments show that in general the machined surface becomes rougher with increase in current and voltage. Microstructures of the specimens also show that craters on the finished surface become larger as a result of using higher current and voltage. It was also found that wires of smaller diameters give smoother surface than those cut with larger diameters. It has been established that machining of carbides should be limited to wires with diameter equal to or less than 0. 15 mm. Use of wires of greater diameters causes frequent wire breakage.

40|$|Marine {{sediment}} contamination by persistent pollutants such {{as heavy}} metals poses {{one of the}} worst problems to marine ecosystems. Currently in Chile, there are no mandatory environmental quality standards for coastal sediments. This is partly due to lack of environmental legislation as well as insufficient toxicity data and appropriate sediment monitoring techniques. The Quintero bay, located in Valparaiso province in the coastal area of Central Chile, was used for this study. The industrial complex of Quintero Bay {{is considered one of the}} largest in Chile and has approximately 14 companies in current operation, including <b>cement</b> plants, <b>copper</b> smelters, copper concentrators and four coal fueled thermoelectric plants. The aim of this research was to examine the current status of heavy metal pollution of the sediments in Quintero Bay in order to forward the development of any future sediment environmental quality standards (EQS) or monitoring programs in Chile. The study focuses on the heavy metal concentrations in the marine sediments. Several studies of contaminated sediments in Quintero Bay have been carried out and the results obtained from four different sources have been analyzed in this study. Heavy metal concentrations were determined and compared to existing sediment quality guidelines. Almost all of the results of the previous studies indicate that all metal concentrations, except arsenic and copper, fell within the lower end of the sediment quality guideline range. This may signify that those metals from the sediments pose little to no potential threat to the marine organisms. Based on the Canadian SQGs, arsenic and copper will most likely cause adverse biological effects. The Quintero Bay could be categorized as unpolluted to slightly polluted marine environment, so it is important to monitor and evaluate the possible impacts of heavy metals in the sediments. Since the legislation is not available in Chile, it is advisable to evaluate the results with some of the existing EQS, and use the data for establishing local sediment quality guidelines in the future...|$|R

This paper presents results obtained on the chemical fixation of bivalent copper. The tests were carried out utilizing three different concentration levels (2 %, 4 %, and 8 % by weight) of bivalent copper, added as copper chloride. Two series of tests were carried out, the first using only cement as a binder, the second adding silica fume to the cement. The results obtained show that the immediate leaching of copper in the alkaline solidification bath is very low, and that the addition of silica fume to the matrix causes a reduction in copper release leading immediately to a greater amount of this element being immobilized in the cement matrix.

40|$|On the 19 th of February 2010, the Ministry of Transport and Communication {{presented}} the Norwegian National Rail Administration {{with the task}} of assessing different aspects of the future of high-speed rail in Norway. The report, the Norwegian High-Speed Rail Assessment (NHSRA), consist three separate evaluations where the climate assessment by Bergsdal et al. (2012), motivated this thesis. Results from the report identify the railway infrastructure as the dominant emission source for the corridor, with the length of tunnels representing the determining factor. Simultaneously, an ongoing debate is comparing the safety and performance of track and tunnel technologies traditionally used in Norway to that of foreign tunnelling technology such as the drill and blast method which apply a full cast (European method), and a double shielded tunnel boring machine (TBM). The newest development in track technology is the slab track, which is now evaluated for tunnels and bridges in Norway (Jernbaneverket 2011). This thesis contributes to the ongoing debate concerning the construction of infrastructure for high-speed rail in Norway, by emphasizing the environmental impact of several relevant technologies and geological conditions. The assessment includes an evaluation of the impact of different tunnelling and track technologies, calculated for operation speeds of both 250 km/h and 330 km/h. Further, the environmental impact of different levels of support work and grout is assessed. In addition, this thesis includes a sensitivity analysis of the impact of service life for railway components. The assessment is calculated for two functional units: one meter tunnel and tunnel track, and for the case corridor, the potential high-speed rail corridor between Oslo-Stavanger, estimated for 250 km/h obtained from the NHSRA by Bergsdal et al. (2012). Our results from this assessment account for the use of <b>cement,</b> steel and <b>copper</b> as the environmentally most important materials. Among the railway components, the tunnel lining and grout constitute the highest emission level of the case corridor. The different technical alternatives are compared against the technologies traditionally applied in Norway, and an average level of support work, which represents the baseline results of this thesis. Our results indicate that the double shielded tunnel-boring machine is the technology that contributes to the highest increase of emission level compared to baseline. Further, the variables that hold the greatest potential of reducing total emission level is the installation of slab track in tunnels and bridges, and level of grout in the tunnel construction. </p...|$|R
