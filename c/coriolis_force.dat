5|$|Jet streams are {{the product}} of two factors: the {{atmospheric}} heating by solar radiation that produces the large scale Polar, Ferrel, and Hadley circulation cells, and the action of the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force</b> acting on those moving masses. The <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force</b> is caused by the planet's rotation on its axis. On other planets, internal heat rather than solar heating drives their jet streams. The Polar jet stream forms near the interface of the Polar and Ferrel circulation cells; while the subtropical jet forms near the boundary of the Ferrel and Hadley circulation cells.|$|E
5|$|There are six main {{requirements}} for tropical cyclogenesis: sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures, atmospheric instability, high humidity {{in the lower}} to middle levels of the troposphere, enough <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force</b> to sustain a low pressure center, a preexisting low level focus or disturbance, and low vertical wind shear. While these conditions are necessary for tropical cyclone formation, they do not guarantee that a tropical cyclone will form.|$|E
5|$|The tidal {{effect of}} the planets is weak and does not {{significantly}} affect {{the shape of the}} Sun. The Sun rotates faster at its equator than at its poles. This differential rotation is caused by convective motion due to heat transport and the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force</b> due to the Sun's rotation. In a frame of reference defined by the stars, the rotational period is approximately 25.6 days at the equator and 33.5 days at the poles. Viewed from Earth as it orbits the Sun, the apparent rotational period of the Sun at its equator is about 28 days.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{asymptotic}} behavior of weakly transverse water-waves under a weak <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forcing</b> {{in the long}} wave regime. We derive the Boussinesq-Coriolis equations in this setting and we provide a rigorous justification of this model. Then, from these equations, we derive two other asymptotic models. When the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forcing</b> is weak, we fully justify the rotation-modified Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation (also called Grimshaw-Melville equation). When the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forcing</b> is very weak, we rigorously justify the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation. This work provides the first mathematical justification of the KP approximation under a <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forcing.</b> Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1603. 0878...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Dipteran flight {{requires}} rapid {{acquisition of}} mechanosensory {{information provided by}} modified hindwings known as halteres. Halteres experience torques resulting from <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces</b> that arise during body rotations. Although biomechanical and behavioral data indicate that halteres detect <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces,</b> there are scant data regarding neural encoding of these or any other <b>forces.</b> <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces</b> arise on the haltere as it oscillates in one plane while rotating in another, and occur at oscillation frequency and twice the oscillation frequency. Using single-fiber recordings of haltere primary afferent responses to mechanical stimuli, we show that spike rate increases linearly with stimulation frequency up to 150 Hz, much higher than twice the natural oscillation frequency of 40 Hz. Furthermore, spike-timing precision is extremely high throughout the frequency range tested. These characteristics indicate that afferents respond with high speed and high precision, neural features that are useful for detecting <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces.</b> Additionally, we found that neurons respond preferentially to specific stimulus directions, with most responding more strongly to stimulation in the orthogonal plane. Directional sensitivity, coupled with precise, high-speed encoding, suggests that haltere afferents are capable of providing information about forces occurring at the haltere base, including <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces...</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{second factor}} which {{contributes}} to a concentrated jet, that is more applicable to the subtropical jet, which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical Hadley cell and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air rises to the tropopause, and moves poleward before sinking; this is the Hadley cell circulation. As it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum, since friction with the ground is significant. Air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force</b> (true for either hemisphere), which for poleward moving air implies an increased eastward component of the winds (note that leftward deflection in the southern hemisphere).|$|E
5|$|A simple rule {{of thumb}} is that for {{high-pressure}} areas, where generally air flows from the center outward, the <b>coriolis</b> <b>force</b> given by the earth's rotation to the air circulation is in the opposite direction of earth's apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere's pole. So, both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. The opposite to these two cases occurs {{in the case of a}} high. These results derive from the Coriolis effect; that article explains in detail the physics, and provides an animation of a model to aid understanding.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the northwestern}} Pacific {{there are no}} {{official}} typhoon seasons as tropical cyclones form throughout the year. Like any tropical cyclone, there are six main requirements for typhoon formation and development: sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures, atmospheric instability, high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere, enough <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force</b> to develop a low pressure center, a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance, and low vertical wind shear. While the majority of storms form between June and November, a few storms do occur between December and May (although tropical cyclone formation is at a minimum during that time). On average, the northwestern Pacific features the most numerous and intense tropical cyclones globally. Like other basins, they are steered by the subtropical ridge towards the west or northwest, with some systems recurving near and east of Japan. The Philippines receive {{the brunt of the}} landfalls, with China and Japan being impacted slightly less. Some of the deadliest typhoons in history have struck China. Southern China has the longest record of typhoon impacts for the region, with a thousand-year sample via documents within their archives. Taiwan has received the wettest known typhoon on record for the northwest Pacific tropical cyclone basins.|$|E

40|$|A {{combination}} of centrifugal and <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces</b> drive the secondary circulation of turbidity currents in sinuous channels, and hence determine where erosion and {{deposition of sediment}} occur. Using laboratory experiments we show that when centrifugal forces dominate, the density interface shows a superelevation at the outside of a channel bend. However when <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces</b> dominate, the interface is always deflected to the right (in the Northern Hemisphere) for both left and right turning bends. The relative importance of either centrifugal or <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces</b> {{can be described in}} terms of a Rossby number defined as Ro = U/fR, where U is the mean downstream velocity, f the Coriolis parameter and R the radius of curvature of the channel bend. Channels with larger bends at high latitudes have ∣Ro∣ < 1 and are dominated by <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces,</b> whereas smaller, tighter bends at low latitudes have ∣Ro∣ ≫ 1 and are dominated by centrifugal forces...|$|R
50|$|This matrix {{can be seen}} as a {{constant}} tensor field, defined in the whole space, that will yield <b>coriolis</b> <b>forces</b> when multiplied by momentum vectors.|$|R
5|$|All {{these facts}} are {{consequences}} of the thermal wind relation. The balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on {{the mass of the}} parcel and the buoyancy force, or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the parcel. Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction: upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight, and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force. The balance in the vertical direction is referred to as hydrostatic. Beyond the tropics, the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction, and the primary struggle is between the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force</b> and the pressure gradient force. Balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic. Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, one can derive the thermal wind relation: the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient. If two air masses, one cold and dense to the North and the other hot and less dense to the South, are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed, the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass. The Coriolis effect will then cause poleward-moving mass to deviate to the East, while equatorward-moving mass will deviate toward the west. The general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction. As a result, winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude. Therefore, the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence {{of the fact that the}} Equator is warmer than the North and South poles.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the year, the South Pacific High {{influences}} the climate by bringing cold, moist air masses originating from Patagonia. During {{the most intense}} cold waves, they form when a transient high pressure system located in the South Pacific Ocean moves eastwards to {{the southern tip of}} South America. As it begins to move, this high pressure system strengthens the South Pacific High and is forced to move southwards to south of 40oS where the Andes are shorter in height. As well, an upper level ridge forms over the South Pacific Ocean along with an upper level trough extending from subtropical latitudes to the South Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, a low pressure system forms over the South Atlantic Ocean which eventually strengthens. The formation a cold front associated with it moves to the northeast owing to the topographic barrier that the Andes forms. The passage of the cold front to the northeast leads to the movement of the high pressure system from the South Pacific Ocean into the southern tip of South America. All of these conditions lead to strong anticyclogenesis to the east of the Andes and thus, the high pressure system intensifies as it enters southern Argentina. When both the high pressure system (over southern Argentina) and low pressure system strengthen, it creates a very strong pressure gradient that draws cold air from the south, strengthening southerly winds. Owing to the topographic barrier of the Andes, it forces and channels the cold air to accumulate on {{the eastern side of the}} Andes. This generates an ageostropic component from the south (due to a reduction in the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force</b> caused by accumulation of cold air on the eastern side of the Andes) that draw this cold air northwards, which is driven by this pressure gradient. Cold air can move northwards until 18oS when the blocking effect of the Andes is smaller due to a change in its orientation. Overall, these conditions results in the coldest temperatures due to the cold masses from high latitudes being pulled northwards. A weaker cold wave occurs when the South Pacific High remains over the ocean and does not have a migratory high pressure system originating from the South Pacific High that moves east of the Andes (it builds over the Andes). Although this occurs throughout the year, during winters, it leads to cold temperatures while during summer, it leads to strong and deep convections. These convections are responsible for about 50% of summer precipitation south of 25oS.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{pressure}} force must exactly counterbalance the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force</b> anyway, so the {{parcel of air}} needs to travel with the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force</b> contrary to the decreasing sideways slope of pressure.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} impact of the Coriolis effect is in the large-scale dynamics of the oceans and the atmosphere. In meteorology and oceanography, it is convenient to postulate a rotating frame of reference wherein the Earth is stationary. In accommodation of that provisional postulation, the centrifugal and <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces</b> are introduced. Their relative importance {{is determined by the}} applicable Rossby numbers. Tornadoes have high Rossby numbers, so, while tornado-associated centrifugal forces are quite substantial, <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces</b> associated with tornadoes are for practical purposes negligible.|$|R
25|$|Since friction, {{pressure}} gradient and <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces</b> {{do not necessarily}} balance out, air masses actually accelerate and decelerate, so the actual speed depends on its past values too.|$|R

25|$|In physics, the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force</b> is an {{inertial}} force that acts on {{objects that are}} in motion relative to a rotating reference frame. In a reference frame with clockwise rotation, the force acts {{to the left of}} the motion of the object. In one with anticlockwise rotation, the force acts to the right. Deflection of an object due to the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force</b> is called the Coriolis effect. Though recognized previously by others, the mathematical expression for the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force</b> appeared in an 1835 paper by French scientist Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis, in connection with the theory of water wheels.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted {{to the study of the}} long wave {{approximation}} for water waves under the influence of the gravity and a <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forcing.</b> We start by deriving a generalization of the Boussinesq equations in 1 D (in space) and we rigorously justify them as an asymptotic model of the water waves equations. These new Boussinesq equations are not the classical Boussinesq equations. A new term due to the vorticity and the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forcing</b> appears that can not be neglected. Then, we study the Boussinesq regime and we derive and fully justify different asymptotic models when the bottom is flat : a linear equation linked to the Klein-Gordon equation admitting the so-called Poincaré waves; the Ostrovsky equation, which is a generalization of the KdV equation in presence of a <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forcing,</b> when the rotation is weak; and finally the KdV equation when the rotation is very weak. Therefore, this work provides the first mathematical justification of the Ostrovsky equation.

We present novel experiments on channelized gravity currents running over an erodible bed, where the magnitude of <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces</b> is changed to reproduce conditions at low and high latitudes. We find a striking systematic change in deposition and erosion patterns as <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces</b> become dominant at high latitudes so that erosion and deposition occur only {{on opposite sides of}} channels; in contrast, at low latitudes significant inner-bank intra-channel bars form on alternate sides of sinuous channels. Our observations show very good agreement with sedimentation patterns in Coriolis-dominated contourite drift systems and with deposits in modern and ancient turbidity current channels.
