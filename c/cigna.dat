5|$|On 15 July 2010, despite Octopus' {{claims to}} have never sold data, a former {{employee}} of the <b>CIGNA</b> insurance company claimed <b>CIGNA</b> purchased records for 2.4 million Octopus users. On 20 July, Octopus acknowledged selling customers' personal details to <b>Cigna</b> and CPP, and started an internal review of their data practices. Octopus Holdings made 44 million Hong Kong dollars ($5.7M USD) over 4.5 years. Roderick Woo Bun, Hong Kong's Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, gave radio interviews and called for transparent investigation, but his term expired {{at the end of}} July 2010. Allan Chiang Yam-wang was announced as the incoming Privacy Commissioner. This news was met with protests and international outrage, due to his prior history of privacy invasions involving cameras used to spy on his employees at the Post Office, and disclosing hundreds of job applicants' personal data to corporations. Outgoing Privacy Commissioner Woo pledged to finish a preliminary report on the Octopus privacy abuse before his term ends, and called for a new law making it a criminal offence for companies to sell personal data.|$|E

She told the paper that Acer did not make any extra effort towards the enforcement of universal precautions, despite CIGNA'S procedural manual for dentists covered this very subject, which included the use of masks and gloves while treating patients.

25|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1950s, the suburbs ringing Hartford began to grow and {{flourish}} and the capital city began a long decline. Insurance giant Connecticut General (now <b>CIGNA)</b> moved to a new, modern campus in the suburb of Bloomfield.

Other residents have included former Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Cole Hamels, former Philadelphia 76ers player Andre Iguodala, and executives from Comcast, GlaxoSmithKline, and <b>Cigna.</b> As a result of slow sales, the top floors (48–57) of the Residences at Two Liberty Place {{were going to be}} converted into a boutique hotel. Due to low interest in using the space as a hotel, plans for the hotel were scrapped, and instead, the raw floors were being converted into 60 condo units in 2015.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Rouse {{sold his}} {{interest}} in One Liberty Place to Japanese insurance company Chyoda. Also, in 1995, {{the owners of the}} Ritz-Carlton Hotel, which included Rouse, defaulted on its US$64 million loan. After a sheriff's auction on December 4 of that year, the creditor, Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, took ownership of the property. The hotel again changed ownership in 1996 when Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association agreed to sell all its hotel properties to Starwood Lodging Trust. In 1999 One Liberty Place, Two Liberty Place, and the Shops of Liberty Place were put up for sale. At the time, One Liberty Place was owned by Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association and Chyoda. Two Liberty Place was owned by a partnership led by Willard Rouse called 1650 Market Associates and the Shops of Liberty Place was owned jointly by the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association and 1650 Market Associates. One Liberty Place and the Shops at Liberty Place were sold later that year to Sunbelt Management a Palm Beach Gardens, Florida firm owned by German businessman Hugo Mann. Sunbelt acquired the property for a bargain price of US$250 million. The bargain price was a result of One Liberty Place being 99.9 percent leased {{at the time of the}} sale and the majority of long-term leases signed when the real estate market was depressed. Rents for One Liberty Place were around US$10 lower than competing office buildings. Two Liberty Place was struggling to find a buyer because it was uncertain <b>Cigna</b> would renew its lease which would expire in 2006.|$|E

[...] Days earlier, orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews had performed a physical examination on Bagwell and determined that he had become [...] "completely disabled" [...] in terms of ability to play baseball again, including a maximum ability to throw a baseball [...] for short distances. [...] Because of the language of the policy, the Astros could not release him without losing their settlement, nor could he take the field. [...] The decision effectively eliminated his chances of playing again in the Major Leagues. [...] On March 28, <b>Cigna</b> rejected the claim, contending that because Bagwell had played during 2005 World Series he could not have become more disabled during the period of baseball inactivity characteristic of the offseason.|$|E

2500|$|Liberty Place was {{designed}} by architect Helmut Jahn and his firm Murphy/Jahn. The steel and blue glass skyscrapers were heavily influenced by New York City's Chrysler Building. The major influence is the spire made of gabled angular setbacks. Two Liberty Place's spire is shorter and squatter, a design influenced by the needs of tenant <b>Cigna.</b> In the 2000s <b>Cigna</b> reduced its presence in the tower, {{which led to the}} owners converting the upper floors into 122 luxury condominiums. Below the two towers is the 289 room Westin hotel and the [...] Shops at Liberty Place. The main feature of the mall is a round atrium topped by a large glass dome.|$|E

2500|$|Under the {{concepts}} of [...] Torts [...] under Anglo-American Common Law, these points might {{best be described as}} a defense of contributory negligence. In other words, Ms Calad and Mr. Davila might have prevented the damage to their person for which they are allowed no monetary damages in court if they had properly enforced their ERISA or THCLA rights against <b>CIGNA</b> and Aetna to prevent the injury from happening. The fact that ERISA had failed to prevent the harm, however, {{and the fact that it}} was ruled by the Supreme Court that neither <b>CIGNA</b> nor Aetna could owe monetary damages for their contribution to the harm done, shows that there is a need for change, either in ERISA itself by Congress or by Supreme Court common law.|$|E

The condominiums range in price from US$800,000 for a 40th-floor single bedroom to more than US$15 millions for a [...] penthouse. Because of low sales of the condos, the top portion of the building was to be converted into a boutique hotel in 2013. Due to low interest in the hotel, the top 10 floors of The Residences (floors 48–57) were to be converted into 60 condo units in 2015. Two Liberty Place's lobby was originally specifically designed for <b>Cigna</b> which used to lease the entire building. After <b>Cigna</b> reduced its presence in the tower, three separate lobbies were created, each with its own elevator bank, one for <b>Cigna,</b> one for the other corporate tenants, and the third for the residents.|$|E

Phase 2 of the complex broke ground on February 16, 1988 with a ceremony that included thousands of purple, blue, and white balloons being released. Phase two of the project consisted of the remainder of the Liberty Place complex, the Two Liberty Tower, a Ritz-Carlton Hotel, a two-story shopping mall, and a parking garage. The Ritz-Carlton Hotel opened on November 5, 1990, and the shopping mall, called Shops at Liberty Place, opened a week later on November 13. The mall opened during an economic downturn and a quarter of the mall space was vacant. Fifty stores and fourteen restaurants leased space when the mall opened.

Two Liberty Place's spire contains fewer gabled setbacks giving the tower a more squat appearance, but allowing about the same amount of interior space as One Liberty Place.

The two towers held their place as first and second tallest buildings in Philadelphia until the Comcast Center was topped off in 2007. Liberty Place was received enthusiastically by critics and led to the construction of other tall skyscrapers giving Philadelphia what architecture critic Paul Goldberger called [...] "one of the most appealing skylines of any major American city".|$|E
