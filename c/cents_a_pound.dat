5|$|Following a brief post-war downturn, boom times {{returned}} to Jerome in the 1920s. Copper prices rose to 24 <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> <b>pound</b> in 1929, and United Verde and UVX operated at near capacity. Wages rose, consumers spent, and the town's businesses—including five automobile dealerships—prospered. United Verde, seeking stable labor relations, added disability and life insurance benefits for its workers {{and built a}} baseball field, tennis courts, swimming pools, and a public park in Jerome. Both companies donated to the Jerome Public Library and helped finance projects for the town's schools, churches, and hospitals.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, {{after the}} start of the Great Depression, the price of copper fell to 14cents a pound. In response, United Verde began {{reducing}} its work force; UVX operated at a loss, and the third big mine, Verde Central, closed completely. The price of copper fell further in 1932 to 5 <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> <b>pound,</b> leading to layoffs, temporary shut-downs, and wage reductions in the Verde District. In 1935, the Clark family sold United Verde to Phelps Dodge, and in 1938 UVX went out of business.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after he}} signed the contract, several other {{shiploads}} of rice arrived from Peru, causing the price of rice to plummet to three <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> <b>pound.</b> Norton tried to void the contract, stating the dealer had misled him as {{to the quality of}} rice to expect. From 1853 to 1857, Norton and the rice dealers were involved in a protracted litigation. Although Norton prevailed in the lower courts, the case reached the Supreme Court of California, which ruled against Norton. Later, the Lucas Turner and Company Bank foreclosed on his real estate holdings in North Beach to pay Norton's debt. He filed for bankruptcy and by 1858 was living in reduced circumstances at a working class boarding house.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, many colleges and school districts across Florida remained closed. President George W. Bush declared all of Florida a federal disaster area. Kennedy Space Center did not restore its complete work force until September 13 due to relief operations, as well as a lack of gasoline, ice, and water in the area. A total of 8000 members of the National Guard helped out with recovery efforts soon after the storm left the Florida peninsula. Residents in the areas of impact after the storm were under a boil water order, {{because of the lack of}} electricity to area water systems. Churches prepared meals for those without power and food themselves. Federal employees were granted excused absences if they helped with law enforcement and the cleanup. Thousands of portable generators were sent to the state by Home Depot and Lowe's home improvement stores. The United States Army Corps of Engineers installed blue tarpaulins on 41,556 damaged roofs statewide. Damage to the Florida citrus crop caused orange futures to rise four <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> <b>pound</b> due to Frances.|$|E
25|$|Later, in {{the spring}} of '71, Captain William Meade would bring in a pack train from Hazelton, and he would make many {{improvements}} on that trail. Despite the fact that these roads were built and improved during the rush years, the trip was still perilous and very costly. Steamer fare on the Fraser River on the Enterprise or the Victoria was $25 and 12.5 <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> <b>pound</b> was added for baggage. Smaller boats near the gold fields charged $7 for the ride and 7 <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> <b>pound</b> for baggage. At Takla Landing, yet more money was required, as that was a road toll that charged 18 <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> <b>pound</b> for baggage.|$|E
25|$|Consumers {{were also}} {{unhappy with the}} system. Manipulated prices often forced them to pay {{unexpectedly}} high prices for staple foods. For example, in 1906 and 1907, the price of food skyrocketed mysteriously. Onion prices climbed from 10 <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> <b>pound</b> in 1906 to a dollar a pound in 1907 (from US$0.10 to $1.00). By comparison, {{a pair of shoes}} cost $2.00 at the time.|$|E

West and Lowe ranch, the pickets were uncommunicative, but it was learned through their captain that the picketers are organized for shifts continuing throughout twenty-four hours. All wore signs reading 'This ranch under strike.'" [...] The Los Angeles Times reported that the rationale for the strikes was to obtain [...] "a rate increase of 40 <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> hundred <b>pounds</b> for picketers over the rate established at the recent meeting of the San Joaquin Valley Agricultural Bureau, and which cotton growers throughout Kern county agreed to support. The rate as established is 60 cents per hundred pounds." ...|$|R
25|$|In 1890, Dallas annexed {{the city}} of East Dallas, which was larger {{geographically}} than Dallas. The annexation made Dallas the most populous city in Texas. In 1893, following the national financial panic, numerous industries and five Dallas banks failed. Cotton prices dipped below five <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> <b>pound,</b> and the lumber and flour markets had all but vanished, so many people began leaving the city. By 1898, the city began to recover and grow again. In 1894, Parkland Memorial Hospital opened just west of Oak Lawn. In 1903, Oak Cliff, a city across the Trinity River, was annexed.|$|E
25|$|As {{economic}} difficulties worsened, Iowa farmers sought to find local solutions. Faced with extremely low farm prices, including corn at ten cents a bushel and pork at three <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> <b>pound,</b> some farmers in western Iowa formed the Farmers Holiday Association. This group, {{which had its}} greatest strength {{in the area around}} Sioux City, tried to withhold farm products from markets. They believed this practice would force up farm prices. The Farm Holiday Association had only limited success as many farmers did not cooperate and the withholding itself did little to raise prices. Farmers experienced little relief until 1933 when the federal government, as part of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, created a federal farm aid program.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} years of the Porfiriato (Porfirio Díaz Era), the Díaz {{administration}} had to combat several attacks from the Lerdista forces and the Apache. A new rebellion led by the Lerdista party was orchestrated from exile in the United States. The Lerdista forces were able to temporarily occupy the city of El Paso del Norte until mid-1877. During 1877 the northern parts of the state suffered through a spell of extreme drought which were responsible for many deaths in El Paso del Norte. The officials in Mexico City reduced the price of corn from six cents to two <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> <b>pound.</b> The northern portion of the state continued to decline economically which led to another revolt led by G. Casavantes in August 1879; Governor Trías was accused of misappropriation of funds and inefficient administration of the state. Casavantes took the state capital and occupied it briefly; he was also successful in forcing Governor Trías to exile. Shortly afterwards, the federal government sent an entourage led by Treviño; Casavantes was immediately ordered to resign his position. Casavantes declared political victory as he was able to publicly accuse and depose Governor Trías. At the same time the states of Durango and Coahuila had a military confrontation over territorial claims and water rights; this altercation between the state required additional federal troops to stabilize the area. Later a dispute ensued again among the states of Coahuila, Durango, and Chihuahua over the mountain range area known as Sierra Mojada, when large deposits of gold ore was discovered. The state of Chihuahua officially submitted a declaration of protest in May 1880 that shortly after was amicably settled. Despite the difficulties at the beginning, Díaz was able to secure and stabilize the state, which earned the confidence and support of the people.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, California was in {{the midst}} of a gold rush; backed by this sudden demand for luxuries, New England {{companies}} made the first shipments, by ship to San Francisco and Sacramento, in California, including a shipment of refrigerated apples. The market was proved, but shipping ice in this way was expensive and demand outstripped supply. Ice began to be ordered instead from the then Russian-controlled Alaska in 1851 at $75 a ton (901kg). The American-Russian Commercial Company was subsequently formed in San Francisco in 1853 to work in partnership with the Russian-American Company of Alaska to supply ice to the west coast of America. The Russian company trained Aleutian teams to harvest ice in Alaska, built saw-mills to produce insulating saw-dust and shipped the ice south along with supplies of chilled fish. The costs of this operation remained high and M. Tallman founded the rival Nevada Ice Company, which harvested ice on Pilot Creek and transported to Sacramento, bringing the west coast price for ice down to seven <b>cents</b> ($2) <b>a</b> <b>pound</b> (0.5kg).|$|R
5000|$|As a {{protective}} measure, the tariff legislation was very temperate. It placed a duty of twenty-five percent on cottons and woolens {{for a period}} of three years (until June 1819), at which time it would drop to twenty percent. A duty of thirty percent was placed on iron, leather, hats, writing paper and cabinet ware, as well as three <b>cents</b> on <b>a</b> <b>pound</b> of sugar. (Iron duties were further increased in 1818 as a defense measure.) [...] Low grade printed fabrics from British colonies in India, however cheaply they were priced, were accessed at a fixed rate of twenty-five cents per square yard. This was the only overtly protective feature of the legislation, and served to exclude these foreign textiles altogether from US markets. [...] The bill - requiring a simple majority for passage - passed 88 yeas to 54 nays in the House (62% to 38%). Both parties were divided, with Republicans voting nationwide 63 yeas to 31 nays, and the Federalists voting 25 yeas to 23 nays.|$|R

[...] Boston’s consumption leapt from 6,000 tons to 85,000 tons during that same period. [...] Ice harvesting created a “cooling culture” as majority of people used ice and iceboxes to store their dairy products, fish, meat, and even fruits and vegetables. [...] These early cold storage practices paved the way for many Americans to accept the refrigeration technology that would soon take over the country.|$|R

40|$|The major {{cost item}} in broilex {{production}} is feed. Previous {{studies indicate that}} feed costs generally constitute 65 - 75 {{percent of the total}} cost of producing broilers. Hence, one of the major opportunities for increasing profits from broiler production is to minimize the costs of producing birds of a given weight. Great {{progress has been made in}} recent years in developing high energy feeds and feeding formulas which lessen the total pounds of feed required in producing a bird of a given weight. However, even though high energy, rapid gain formulas have been developed, the problem of how major sources or categories of feeds should be combined to minimize costs of gains still remains. Ordinarily, broiler feeds are made up of two major categories of feeds, along with the proper vitamins and minerals. These two categories include feeds high in carbohydrate such as corn and feeds high in protein such as soybean oilmeal. If prices of these feeds did not change, the least-cost ration determined a(one point in time also would be the least-cost ration at all later points in time. However, the prices of these major feed sources do change. In recent years the price of corn has been as low as 1. 8 cents per pound with soybean oilmeal as high as 4. 5 <b>cents</b> per <b>pound,</b> <b>a</b> SBOM/corn price ratio of 2. 5; in other years the price of corn has been as high as 4. 5 cents per pound with soybean oilmeal as low as 3. 5 <b>cents</b> per <b>pound,</b> <b>a</b> SBOM/corn price ratio of 0. 8. The ration or combination of these two feeds which minimizes costs of gains under one of these price ratios will not also minimize costs under the other ratio...|$|R

2500|$|South Carolinian George McDuffie popularized the [...] "Forty Bale theory" [...] {{to explain}} South Carolina's {{economic}} woes. He said that tariffs that became progressively higher in 1816, 1824 and 1828 {{had the same}} effect as if a thief stole forty bales out of a hundred from every barn. The tariffs applied to imports of goods such as iron, wool and finished cotton products. The Forty Bale theory was based on faulty math, as Britain could sell finished cotton goods made from Southern raw cotton around the world, {{not just to the}} United States. Still, the theory was a popular explanation for economic problems that were caused in large part by overproduction of cotton in the Deep South competing with South Carolina's declining crops because of its depleted soil. South Carolinians, rightly or wrongly, blamed the tariff for the fact that cotton prices fell from 18 <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> <b>pound</b> to 9 <b>cents</b> <b>a</b> <b>pound</b> during the 1820s.|$|E
