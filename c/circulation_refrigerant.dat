40|$|Usage of {{multiple}} compressors is applied for general VRF system {{at more than}} 12 HP capacity because {{it is difficult to}} keep capacity and performance by usage of one compressor for such large capacity system. But usage {{of multiple}} compressors has problem controlling cost and keeping oil level in each compressor. In this paper, new scroll compressor which can reduce oil <b>circulation</b> in <b>refrigerant</b> circuit, keep oil level in the compressor, keep high capacity and performance and operate in a wide running range and can be applied until 16 HP capacity by usage of one compressor was developed. It is important to keep oil level in a compressor because VRF system has large refrigerant circuit. Analysis of oil and refrigerant flow in the compressor was applied and structure of preventing oil agitation was introduced to reduce oil <b>circulation</b> in <b>refrigerant</b> circuit and keep oil level. The compressor for VRF system is demanded to operate in a wide running range from low speed to high speed and from low load to high load. This compressor can supply oil even if rotational speed is low because this compressor supplies oil by differential pressure and can supply enough oil at low differential pressure by new structure of oil lubrication, therefore running range become wider. And analysis of lubrication between shaft and bearing was applied and this compressor can keep reliability against high load at large capacity by optimal structure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental {{analysis of a}} prototype R 744 water/water heat pump (5 kW heating power at 0 C evaporation temperature, 100 bar gas cooler pressure, 35 C gas cooler outlet temperature) which was equipped with a two-phase ejector. According to the traditional lay-out, the energy that was recovered from the expansion process inside the ejector improved the <b>circulation</b> of <b>refrigerant</b> through the evaporator. The same heat pump was also provided with a back-pressure valve as the expansion device, i. e. a direct comparison of the performance was possible between the heat pump systems, either equipped with the ejector or the expansion valve. Tests were performed to evaluate the performance when the heat pump produced hot tap water, i. e. heating water from the main waterworks temperature to storage temperature (∼ 60 C). Additionally, an investigation took place {{to understand how the}} system performed when space heating was required, i. e. providing hot water with a limited temperature lift, however at relatively high inlet temperatures. Experiments demonstrated that the ejector is helpful to improve the heat pump performance, thus promoting the diffusion of R 744 units also for domestic space heating and air conditioning. Technological issues related to lubricant recovery were faced...|$|R
40|$|A {{compressor}} {{was developed}} using R 32 {{which was a}} low GWP R 32 refrigerant for coping with global warming. However, {{there is a tendency}} for vibrations of a compressor to also increase because the <b>circulation</b> of <b>refrigerant</b> increases according to specification for using R 32 refrigerant. Since large vibrations of a compressor causes outdoor units to generate solid propagation sound, {{there is a need for}} a technology that can reduce vibration of a compressor. However, a vibration-measuring method to analyze such vibration had not been fully developed and it was difficult to specify the cause. Accordingly, a new vibration-measuring method was developed specifically for compressors. The use of this measuring method allowed to discover that one of the unresolved problems with sound of outdoor units was the vertical vibration of the accumulator housed in the compressor. Moreover, it was found that the accumulator vibrates vertically due to the acoustic resonance inside the casing, which led to develop a new (accumulator) design with a focus on resonance. There is a type of spatial resonance inside an accumulator that has a phase difference with the antinode of sound pressure appearing at the upper and lower ends of the space. The vertical force caused by the difference in the sound pressure becomes excitation force, which then causes vertical vibration of the accumulator. Therefore, preventing this resonance from occurring can help suppress the vertical vibration. In order to prevent the generation of resonance, a plate-shaped reflection member was placed inside the accumulator, and it proved to be effective in suppressing the vertical vibration...|$|R
40|$|High-pressure {{supported}} freezing processes need a {{more efficient}} refrigeration technique to be applied at industrial level. A cooling method consisting in the <b>circulation</b> of a <b>refrigerant</b> in ebullition around the product in the vessel has been tested on a lab-scale prototype built for that purpose. The cooling kinetic of a mixture of ethanol, ethylene glycol and water (a usual pressurizing medium) was followed, recording temperatures in the whole sample. A mathematical model has been developed to describe heat transfer during cooling of the sample in the vessel. The heat transfer coefficient between the refrigerant and the vessel was determined by a fitting procedure between the numerical simulation results and the experimental measurements. This model {{should be used to}} predict the cooling kinetics in other conditions (other products, larger vessels) and to optimise the process. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.

40|$|A plate-type evaporator, {{working with}} natural <b>refrigerant</b> <b>circulation,</b> has been {{investigated}} both experimentally and theoretically. Motivated by the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances, HCFC 22 was compared to HFC 134 a and two zeotropic refrigerant mixtures. The effect of different separator liquid levels, i. e. refrigerant flows, and its influence on heat transfer was also studied. The investigated plate-type evaporator consists of thirteen vertical flow channels and its size is 3. 0 m x 0. 5 m. The heat source for the evaporator is a falling water film {{on the outside of}} the plate. Experimental studies have been carried out using a test facility that enabled detailed measurements of heat transfer and pressure drop. Experiments were compared to results from a calculation method that simultaneously calculates heat transfer and pressure drop in a variable number of steps along the evaporator. The calculation method is based on a pressure drop correlation proposed by the VDI-Warmeatlas and a heat transfer correlation for vertical tubes proposed by Steiner and Taborek. For different evaporator duties, heat transfer was over predicted by 12 % for pure fluids by 15 % for mixtures. Calculated pressure drops were well within +/- 5 % of the measured values. Changes in heat transfer due to different flows were closely predicted by the proposed calculation method...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, three {{supermarket}} refrigeration {{systems are}} evaluated; two trans-critical DX CO 2 systems and one R 404 A/CO 2 cascade system. Field measurements of energy consumption, temperatures, pressures, and compressor motor frequency are made using the computer programs IWMAC and LDS. Calculations are performed using the program Refprop and performance {{data from the}} compressor manufacturer. The cooling capacity and coefficient of performance (COP) are calculated and the analysis is made {{for a period of}} four months during the summer, June-September 2010, for all systems. The results show that the cascade system has a significantly lower value of COP than the trans-critical CO 2 systems. This is due to the unusual design and control of the cascade system. The COP also drops because of the extra temperature levels and pumps present in this system. The use of floating condensation and the fact that no pumps are required for <b>refrigerant</b> <b>circulation</b> is beneficial for the trans-critical systems, resulting in higher COP. The operation of the heat recovery systems is investigated and the results suggest some differences in operation between the two trans-critical systems. The influence of system parasites like pumps and fans on system performance is also investigated for the three systems...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{literature}} review and correlation {{of data on}} falling film and spray evaporators. This type of evaporator offers the potential advantages of improved heat-transfer coefficients {{and a reduction in}} charge of evaporating fluid. The challenge in reviewing papers by various authors is that the data appears in different forms, so an attempt has been made to achieve some uniformity in order to critically compare the data. Another objective {{of this paper is to}} provide guidelines for how a developer and manufacturer of this type of evaporator can improve the performance of the model under development. One of the important factors in achieving the maximum improvement in evaporator performance is the proper choice of the rate of <b>refrigerant</b> spray. A <b>circulation</b> rate that is too high increases the refrigerant charge and also increases the pumping power for the <b>circulation</b> of the <b>refrigerant.</b> On the other hand, if the spray rate is too low, some areas on the tube become dry and the heat-transfer coefficient drops off rapidly. Also, the optimum tube placement in a falling-film evaporator may not be the same as in a flooded ~vaporator. This paper also explores research studies on enhanced surfaces for ammonia and the potential combination of enhanced surfaces with the falling film concept...|$|R
40|$|Heat pump {{technology}} {{provides an}} efficient and sustainable solution for both heating and cooling. A traditional heat pump {{can be defined}} as a mechanical-compression cycle refrigeration system powered by electricity. Traditional refrigerants used in heat pumps are ammonia or chlorinated and fluorinated hydrocarbons. Because many of these chlorofluorohydrocarbons (CFC??) are ozone-depleting components, evaluation of more environmentally friendly refrigerants like pure hydrocarbons is important. The efficiency of a heat pump is traditionally measured by the ratio of delivered heat at a high temperature divided by the electricity (or work) input. This is defined as the coefficient of performance (COP). There are several simulation tools available for the simulation of heat pumps. Traditional process simulation tools like Aspen HYSYS or Aspen Plus are useful because they have data for several components inside the program, and many thermodynamic models like equations of states available. It is of interest to calculate the efficiency of a heat pump system when varying temperature conditions, refrigerants, simulation programs and thermodynamic models. There are few references to such comparisons in the open literature. The <b>circulation</b> medium (<b>refrigerant)</b> alternates by the help of a compressor and an expansion valve between the temperatures 22 and 7, 24 and 5 or 24 and - 15 °C. The lowest temperature is the evaporation temperature and the highest is the condensing temperature. The pressures were specified as the saturation pressures at the given temperatures. The evaluated components are ammonia, R- 11, R- 12, R- 22 and propane. The equations of state Peng-Robinson and Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) and the activity model Non-Random-Two-Liquid (NRTL) were used in the process simulation programs Aspen HYSYS and Aspen Plus. COP values have been calculated to values between 3 and 9. The highest COP was calculated for the lowest temperature difference. The components giving the highest COP value between the temperatures 22 and 7 °C were ammonia and R- 12, and R- 22 gave the highest COP between - 15 to 22 °C. Propane (which is not a CFC) gave slightly lower COP values than the other components. The differences between the thermodynamic models and the different programs were normally low. However, some differences between Aspen Plus and Aspen HYSYS for the same model were calculated. The calculated deviations between the same models using different programs are difficult to explain. Different model parameters in different programs may explain differences between the same models in different programs. Aspen Plus and Aspen HYSYS are evaluated to be powerful tools for heat pump calculations. The calculated differences between heat pump efficiencies with different components at different conditions are thought to be reasonable...|$|R
40|$|The Rapid Access Ice Drill (RAID) is {{designed}} for subsurface scientific investigations in Antarctica. Its objectives are to drill rapidly through ice, to core samples of the transition zone and bedrock, and to leave behind a borehole observatory. These objectives required the engineering and fabrication of an entirely new drilling system that included a modified mining-style coring rig, a unique fluid circulation system, a rod skid, a power unit, and a workshop with areas for the storage of supplies and consumables. An important milestone in fabrication of the RAID was {{the construction of a}} North American Test (NAT) facility where we were able to test drilling and fluid processing functions in an environment that is {{as close as possible to}} that expected in Antarctica. Our criteria for site selection was that the area should be cold during the winter months, be located in an area of low heat flow, and be at relatively high elevation. We selected a site for the facility near Bear Lake, Utah, USA. The general design of the NAT well (NAT- 1) started with a 27. 3  cm (10. 75  in.) outer casing cemented in a 152  m deep hole. Within that casing, we hung a 14  cm (5. 5  in.) casing string, and, within that casing, a column of ice was formed. The annulus between the 14 and 27. 3  cm casings provided the path for <b>circulation</b> of a <b>refrigerant.</b> After in-depth study, we chose to use liquid CO 2 to cool the hole. In order to minimize the likelihood of the casing splitting due to the volume increase associated with freezing water, the hole was first cooled and then ice was formed in increments from the bottom upward. First, ice cubes were placed in the inner liner and then water was added. Using this method, a column of ice was incrementally prepared for drilling tests. The drilling tests successfully demonstrated the functioning of the RAID system. Reproducing such a facility for testing of other ice drilling systems could be advantageous to other research programs in the future...|$|R
40|$|In a {{refrigeration}} cycle, a {{small portion}} of the compressor oil circulates with the refrigerant flow through the cycle components, while most of the oil stays in the compressor. The presence of the lubricant affects the performance of heat exchangers by increasing the pressure losses and adding a thermal resistance to the heat transfer exchange process. The oil effects on microchannel heat exchangers are unique due to their relatively small scale geometry and manifold configuration. In this paper, oil retention in a microchannel type condenser was measured and its effects on heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics are presented. The heat exchanger was a 2 passes, aluminum louvered-fin type condenser that consisted of multiports rectangular microchannels with hydraulic diameter of 0. 06 inch (1. 7 mm). The refrigerant and oil flow rates were varied and actual operating conditions of an air conditioning condenser for R 410 A systems were replicated in laboratory. The refrigerant R 410 A and Polyolester oil mixture was studied at saturation temperature from 85 to 130 °F (29 to 54 °C) and two refrigerant mass flux that are common for a 4 ton nominal capacity AC system for residential applications. Oil mass fraction (OMF) in <b>circulation</b> with the <b>refrigerant</b> was varied from 0. 5 to 5. 6 in wt. %. The results indicated that at OMFs of 0. 5 wt. % to 1 wt. %, which are common ranges in typical air conditioning systems, the oil retention in the microchannel condenser was less than 5 % of the microchannel condenser internal volume for all saturation temperatures and all mass fluxes studied in this work. The oil retained in the condenser increased if the OMF increases and it was measured up to 23 % of the total microchannel condenser internal volume when the OMF was 5. 4 wt. %. The superheated vapor refrigerant section of the condenser held small amount of oil due to high refrigerant vapor superficial velocities inside the microchannel tubes. At OMFs of 0. 5 wt. % the heat transfer capacity of the coil was the same of that of oil free conditions. At high saturation temperature of 130 °F (54 °C). and high mass flux, the heat transfer capacity of the coil decreased as the OMF increased and some penalization of refrigerant-side heat transfer rate was observed at OMFs as low as 1 wt. %. If OMF increased then the heat transfer capacity of the heat exchanger was penalized by up to 9 % and the pressure drops across the condenser was augmented up to 19 % with respect to the oil free case...|$|R
