25|$|Australia {{lost the}} series three Tests to nil. After {{managing}} {{to draw the}} first two Tests, they lost the next three; the West Indies did not lose a second innings wicket all tour. Hughes {{did not have a}} successful tour with the bat, scoring 215 runs at an average of 21.50. The pressure of the tour told on Hughes. In a match against Trinidad and Tobago, Hughes protested against what he saw as unreasonableness by the opposition by treating the remainder of the match with contempt; not attempting to win. Afterwards Hughes said he could not <b>care</b> <b>less</b> <b>about</b> the welfare of cricket in Trinidad and Tobago; the management fined him for this comment. In the second Test, Rodney Hogg threw a punch at Hughes, frustrated that he was not given the field he wanted by his captain.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{criticized the}} lack of Master Chief as a main character, similar to the {{response}} to The Halo Graphic Novel; Schedeen said that [...] "Master Chief is barely a guest star in his own book", {{and that he was}} reduced to blasting aliens for much of the series. Schedeen felt that {{there was a lack of}} connections between the Ruwan plot and the Master Chief's adventures, which was never satisfactorily resolved. The comic's focus on Ruwan and Myra's subplot was also seen as a major fault: Comics Bulletin's Geoff Collins, in a review of the second issue, said that [...] "as a comic book fan I’m interested , but the Halo fans I know could [...] <b>care</b> <b>less</b> <b>about</b> them. And the story in this issue centers around them." [...] Schedeen was surprised to find that he only began to care about them in the final issue. The many delays in publishing were a frequent point of frustration as well. Schedeen summed up his reviews by saying that he was hopeful the production teams behind the upcoming Halo books [...] "will learn from the mistakes made here and craft stories that can consistently capture what makes Halo fun. At the very least, let's hope we don't have to wait a year between issues anymore".|$|E

In 1963 he wrote: [...] "I couldnt <b>care</b> <b>less</b> <b>about</b> literary life, in reality that only means your a name in a bookcase.

Blake is further enraged when Steven goes to work for longtime friend Matthew, in whom Steven sees qualities lacking in Blake. Though previously {{in a relationship with}} another man, Steven finds himself drawn to Claudia, who is putting her life back together after spending time in a psychiatric hospital.

2500|$|On 16 July, Bethmann Hollweg told Count Roedern, the State Secretary for Alsace-Lorraine, that he couldn't <b>care</b> <b>less</b> <b>about</b> Serbia or alleged Serbian {{complicity}} in the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. All that mattered was that Austria attack Serbia that summer, {{to result in a}} win-win situation for Germany. If Bethmann Hollweg's view was correct, an Austro-Serbian war would either cause a general war (which Bethmann Hollweg believed Germany would win) or cause the Triple Entente to break up. That same day, the Russian Ambassador to Austria-Hungary reported to St. Petersburg that, [...] "Information reaches me that the Austro-Hungarian government {{at the conclusion of the}} inquiry intends to make certain demands on Belgrade...

2500|$|In June 1967, Herb Caen was {{approached}} by [...] "a distinguished magazine" [...] to write about why hippies were attracted to San Francisco. He declined the assignment but interviewed hippies in the Haight for his own newspaper column in the San Francisco Chronicle. Caen determined that, [...] "Except in their music, they couldn't <b>care</b> <b>less</b> <b>about</b> {{the approval of the}} straight world." [...] Caen himself felt that the city of San Francisco was so straight that it provided a visible contrast with hippie culture. On July 7, Time magazine featured a cover story entitled, [...] "The Hippies: The Philosophy of a Subculture." [...] The article described the guidelines of the hippie code: [...] "Do your own thing, wherever {{you have to do it}} and whenever you want. Drop out. Leave society as you have known it. Leave it utterly. Blow the mind of every straight person you can reach. Turn them on, if not to drugs, then to beauty, love, honesty, fun." [...] It is estimated that around 100,000 people traveled to San Francisco in the summer of 1967. The media was right behind them, casting a spotlight on the Haight-Ashbury district and popularizing the [...] "hippie" [...] label. With this increased attention, hippies found support for their ideals of love and peace but were also criticized for their anti-work, pro-drug, and permissive ethos.|$|E
2500|$|While {{infidelity}} is by {{no means}} exclusive to certain groups of people, its perception can be influenced by other factors. Furthermore, within a [...] "homogeneous culture," [...] like that in the United States, factors like community size can be strong predictors of how infidelity is perceived. Larger communities tend to <b>care</b> <b>less</b> <b>about</b> infidelity whereas small towns are much more concerned with such issues. These patterns are observed in other cultures as well. For example, a cantina in a small, rural Mexican community is often viewed as a place where [...] "decent" [...] or [...] "married" [...] women do not go because of its semi-private nature. Conversely, public spaces like the market or plaza are acceptable areas for heterosexual interaction. A smaller population size presents the threat of being publicly recognized for infidelity. However, within a larger community of the same Mexican society, entering a bar or watering hole would garner a different view. It would be deemed perfectly acceptable for both married and unmarried individuals to drink at a bar in a large city. These observations can be paralleled to rural and urban societies in the United States as well (Hirsch et al. 2007). Ultimately, these variables and societal differences dictate attitudes towards sexual infidelity which can vary across cultures as well as within cultures.|$|E
2500|$|Refugee management: European Union is {{presently}} facing the humanitarian consequences of NATO-led 'democracy' promotion agenda which severely destabilized Syria, Libya, Iraq, Yemen and Afghanistan. Abject living conditions and unsafe security situation has driven civilians to vote with their feet, resulting in mass exodus from Europe's periphery. The massive inflow of migrants fleeing civil wars has exposed fundamentally discordant perspectives on an unified EU approach and {{course of action}} to manage the crisis. Eastern and Northern European countries show no urgency to increase their intake of refugees to alleviate the burden on crisis response services in southern EU member states (especially Italy & Greece) who are overburdened with the relentless arrival of refugees. The United Nations demanded that European Union countries {{live up to their}} responsibilities to accept migrant outflows. NGOs have expressed shock at the treatment of refugees in Europe. Northern European and former Communist EU member states like Poland, Slovakia and Hungary whose populations are less multi-ethnic than most Western European countries are reluctant to accept migrants. Radical steps were taken to secure internal borders against migrants : Hungary and Bulgaria opted for razor-wire fences [...] while Austria deployed its army. Far-right political parties and neo-fascist movements (Austria, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Poland and Sweden) have opposed the arrival and resettlement of refugees. Poland's Janusz Korwin-Mikke, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), claimed that EU migrants were: [...] "people coming to Poland and the whole Europe just to live off handouts. People willing to work are valuable, but they are being sent back to their countries and we take in those unwilling to work. This is a ridiculous policy that results in Europe being flooded with human garbage. Let's state this clear: human garbage that doesn't want to work". Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose country hosts the most number of refugees fleeing Syria was scathing in his assessment of the European Union's management of refugees and migrants: [...] "European countries, which turned the Mediterranean Sea -- the cradle of ancient civilisations -- into a migrant cemetery are party to the crime that takes place when each refugee loses their life,". UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said that he was [...] "shocked" [...] that tear gas and water cannons were used by Hungarian police to force migrants away from its border and declared that such treatment of asylum seekers was [...] "unacceptable". The mass exodus, provoked by German Chancellor Angela Merkel's unilateral announcement that Germany will accept Syrian refugees irrespective of where they entered the European Union, and the subsequent slamming shut of Germany's borders to refugees, left many to wonder if the crisis was a political stunt to shift global media attention away from the adverse publicity to the German Chancellor following the debt default by Greece. By March 2016, a significant number of EU countries flatly rejected Germany's plans for a quota based EU-wide refugee redistribution and resettlement scheme besides refusing to bear the consequences of Angela Merkel's unilateral actions. Eastern European countries shoved-away the refugee crisis as Germany's problem and threatened to defy Germany through legal and electoral challenges. The refugee crisis has left Angela Merkel politically isolated in Europe. Amid economic decline, European citizens are increasingly concerned about their living standards and <b>care</b> <b>less</b> <b>about</b> ideology and moral discourses.|$|E
