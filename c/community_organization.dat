Emanuel announced on February 28 that if the author would reveal himself, he would donate $5,000 to the charity of the author's choice. When Chicago journalist Dan Sinker revealed himself, Emanuel donated the money to Young Chicago Authors, a <b>community</b> <b>organization</b> which helps young people with writing and publishing skills.|$|E

50|$|In {{the era of}} {{globalization}} smaller <b>community</b> <b>organizations</b> typically rely on donations (monetary and in-kind) from local community members and sponsorship from local government and businesses.

Across all sizes, Canadian <b>community</b> <b>organizations</b> rely on government funding (49%), earned income (35%), and others through gifts and donations (13%).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Over {{the past}} decade, <b>community</b> <b>organizations</b> and {{citizens}} have increasingly used civil remedies to compel non-offending third parties {{to take action}} to prevent or mitigate crime, drug and disorder problems in their neighborhoods. Nuisance and drug abatement ordinances and municipal codes are the most common civil laws employed by <b>community</b> <b>organizations,</b> {{which may or may not}} work in concert with law enforcement, prosecutors and other government agencies. While civil remedy strategies are not without problems, <b>community</b> <b>organizations</b> report general success in their use. In this chapter, the history of civil remedies used by <b>community</b> <b>organizations</b> is reviewed and the results of a national survey of <b>community</b> <b>organizations</b> are presented. The results include the characteristics of the respondent organizations, the types and prevalence of civil remedy strategies used, problems encountered and outcomes of the application of strategies...|$|R

Three of the people arrested in 1998 were agents for a foreign intelligence agency. One of them had recruited the fourth person to collect intelligence on and to subvert a local <b>community</b> <b>organization.</b> All the detainees were subsequently released.|$|E
5|$|Two {{years after}} graduating from Columbia, Obama was hired in Chicago as {{director}} of the Developing Communities Project, a church-based <b>community</b> <b>organization</b> originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in Roseland, West Pullman, and Riverdale on Chicago's South Side. He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988. He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in Altgeld Gardens. Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the Gamaliel Foundation, a community organizing institute.

40|$|<b>Community</b> <b>organizations</b> play crucial {{roles in}} many Ugandan {{communities}} as they reduce poverty through building employment {{opportunities in the}} villages, educate on health, agriculture and leadership, and help villages develop though exploiting the benefits of cooperating. This study uses theory from the New Institutional Economics School and theories on collective action to investigate factors affecting <b>community</b> <b>organizations</b> in Uganda, and especially how the level of market integration of a community affects the <b>community</b> <b>organizations.</b> Hypotheses {{of the effect of}} market integration, ethnic homogeneity and income inequality on the number and activity level of <b>community</b> <b>organizations</b> are tested using panel data from the Living Standards Measurement Study – Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) project by the World Bank. Additionally, qualitative data from own collected field interviews are used to investigate the factors influencing the change from informal cooperation to establishing <b>community</b> <b>organizations</b> and to complement the analysis of the findings from the quantitative models. The results from the quantitative models weakly indicate that market-integrated communities have higher organizational activity than less market-integrated communities and that ethnical homogeneity of the community is positively related to the organizational activity of the community. These findings are also supported in the field interviews. Income inequalities do not seem to {{have a significant effect on}} the number or activity level of <b>community</b> <b>organizations.</b> Additional factors identified as influencing <b>community</b> <b>organizations</b> are NGO-presence and regional differences. Further, findings from the field interviews suggest that several <b>community</b> <b>organizations</b> struggle to get out of low-participation equilibrium where a too low number of contributing members constrains the possibility of benefiting from the organization and further constrains the interest among the community members of organizing.
