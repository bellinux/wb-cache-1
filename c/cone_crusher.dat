In addition, VSC series cone crusher’s enhanced laminating crushing effect on material particles makes the cubic shape of crushed materials better, which increases the selling point.|$|E
40|$|This paper scientifically {{investigates the}} {{relevance}} and merit of industrial approaches {{to improving the}} shape of crushed rock in the aggregate industry. Of particular interest {{is the degree to}} which the mechanisms which are occurring within the crusher machine can alter what is generally considered to be inherent patterns of breakage for certain rock types. Simple experiments have been conducted that suggest optimal strategies for operation of crushing equipment. A case study is also presented where the shape of material produced in a quarry was inadequate for reaching industry standards. The research is pan of an on-going research project to model the behaviour of <b>cone</b> <b>crushing</b> equipment from a mechanistic perspective. The incorporation of a breakage description that includes shape will add another dimension to the results from the model. Whilst the results are off principal importance to the aggregate industry some useful conclusions can also be made for the mining industry. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Slightly tapered {{truncated}} cones were manufactured from graphite/epoxy preimpregnated unidirectional {{tape and}} were loaded in compression. Different amounts of side loads were introduced by orienting the loading axis {{away from the}} central axis of the cone. The <b>cones</b> were <b>crushed</b> under quasi-static conditions, and their energy absorption was measured. For small amounts of side load, the energy absorbency was improved; however, {{as the amount of}} side load is increased further, the energy absorption capability of the structure is reduced significantly. Furthermore, a tendency for the specimen to topple is observed {{as a result of the}} moment induced by the side loads which reduces the energy absorption properties even further...|$|R

It {{has the advantage of}} reliable construction, high productivity, easy adjustment and lower operational costs. The spring release system of a <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> acts an overload protection that allows tramp to pass through the crushing chamber without damage to the crusher.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{advance in}} <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> {{reliability}} {{has been seen}} in the use of hydraulics to protect crushers from being damaged when uncrushable objects enter the crushing chamber. Foreign objects, such as steel, can cause extensive damage to a <b>cone</b> <b>crusher,</b> and additional costs in lost production.

25|$|A <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> {{is similar}} in {{operation}} to a gyratory crusher, with less steepness in the crushing chamber {{and more of a}} parallel zone between crushing zones. A <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> breaks rock by squeezing the rock between an eccentrically gyrating spindle, which is covered by a wear-resistant mantle, and the enclosing concave hopper, covered by a manganese concave or a bowl liner. As rock enters the top of the <b>cone</b> <b>crusher,</b> it becomes wedged and squeezed between the mantle and the bowl liner or concave. Large pieces of ore are broken once, and then fall to a lower position (because they are now smaller) where they are broken again. This process continues until the pieces are small enough to fall through the narrow opening {{at the bottom of the}} crusher.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the missile}} is fired, all the gunner {{has to do}} is keep the target in the sight's cross hairs, and the system will {{automatically}} track the missile's rear-facing flares, gather the missile into the gunner's sight, and send commands to steer the missile into the gunner's line of sight. Approximately 50 meters after ejecting from the container, the safety system arms the HEAT warhead's fuze and will detonate when the outer skin of the two-layer nose <b>cone</b> is <b>crushed</b> to contact with the inside skin, completing an electrical circuit. With this type of fuzing system, the missile does not have to hit the tip of the missile's nose to detonate the HEAT warhead.

40|$|A pilot {{offshore}} wind turbine with {{a new type of}} an ice-resistant foundation was installed in the Pori sea area of the Northern Baltic Sea during summer 2010. The water depth at the site is nine meters and the ice and wave conditions occasionally get quite heavy. The gravity-type foundation consists of a light ice-strengthened steel shell with a ring footing, ice-breaking <b>cone,</b> and <b>crushed</b> rock fill. The fill provides mass for the foundation and supports the shell against local ice impacts and moments caused by uneven base pressures, as well as stability for the thin shell structure. The ring footing extends the stabilizing moment arm and provides anchorage against overturning. This foundation concept is applicable to a variety of water depths with firm to hard bottom conditions.

5000|$|The mill was a {{conventional}} leach-CIP circuit. The ore was crushed to 3/8" [...] with standard- and short-head <b>cone</b> crushers. The <b>crushed</b> material was fed {{to one of}} two grinding circuits (A-circuit = 3 ball mills, B-circuit = single ball mill). A-circuit {{was one of the first}} in the world to include the fully automated Knelson (gravity) concentrator. A second unit was added to the B-Circuit around the year 2000. Concentrate from the Knelsons was upgraded with a shaking table. That unit was replaced with the first Acacia concentrator installed in North America.|$|R
25|$|For {{the most}} part {{advances}} in crusher design have moved slowly. Jaw crushers have remained virtually unchanged for sixty years. More reliability and higher production {{have been added to}} basic <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> designs that have also remained largely unchanged. Increases in rotating speed have provided the largest variation. For instance, a 48-inch (120cm) <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> manufactured in 1960 may be able to produce 170 tons/h of crushed rock, whereas the same size crusher manufactured today may produce 300 tons/h. These production improvements come from speed increases and better crushing chamber designs.|$|E
25|$|Single {{cylinder}} hydraulic <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> is mainly composed of main frame, transmission device, eccentric shaft, bowl-shaped bearing, crushing cone, mantle, bowl liner, adjusting device, adjusting sleeve, hydraulic control system, hydraulic safety system, dust-proof ring, feed plate, etc.|$|E

The safety cylinder of the machine can ensure safety as well as lift supporting sleeve and static cone by a hydraulic system and automatically remove the blocks in the crushing chamber when the machine is suddenly stuffy. Thus the maintenance rate is greatly reduced and production efficiency is greatly improved as it can remove blocks without disassembling the machine.|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} {{estimation}} of the elasto-damping parameters of a <b>cone</b> inertial <b>crusher</b> mounting. The numerical values of these parameters are crucial for accurate reproduction of the machine vibrational behavior and dynamical model adequacy. Due to the significant difficulties arising during the purely theoretical determination of the stiffness and damping parameters of the rubber vibroisolators it is well-suited to use a theoretical-experimental approach. The developed approach {{is based on the}} theoretical determination of the mounting stiffness parameters as a function of two experimentally measured natural frequencies of the mechanical system. The crusher is represented as a six degrees of freedom system with two planes of symmetry. By using the system characteristic polynomial, the theoretical derivation of mathematical relationships for the mechanical system natural frequencies as a function of stiffness, inertial and geometrical parameters is performed. A good agreement is shown when comparing the experimental and the theoretical results for the system kinematical characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of estimating concrete or mortar strength {{by measuring the}} total water porosity by a very simple method is investigated. Cube strengths of mortar and concrete specimens are correlated with water porosity measured from 'intact' pieces taken from the failure <b>cones</b> of the <b>crushed</b> cubes. It is shown {{that it is not}} possible to acquire a satisfactory correlation of strength and the measured total water porosity of the mortar or concrete mix. However, a very promising correlation (correlation coefficient R> 93 %) is obtained if the 'calculated average paste porosity' Pp is substituted for the measured total water porosity of the mix Pm. Pp can be determined from the measured porosity Pm of the mix, the porosity of the aggregates and the volumetric proportions of the constituents. For the range of strengths investigated, it can be inferred that the strength class of a cement (OPC 35 or OPC 45) does not significantly influence the correlation, but a slightly different correlation seems to exist for pozzolanic cements. © 1994 RILEM...|$|R
40|$|Soils {{generated}} as byproducts {{of construction}} {{are used in}} other projects. When such soils are {{to be used for}} embankments but are unsuitable for such use, they must be solidified first. When solidifying agents are added, the gain in strength appears shortly thereafter, but there are cases where banking cannot be done within the prescribed time after mixing with solidifying agent, due to sudden changes of work schedule or weather. The solidified soil must then be crushed and compacted before use. The strength characteristics of such soil are unclear. To clarify the strength characteristics of soil that has been mixed with solidifying agents, cured for a certain period, crushed and then compacted (“crushed solidified soil”), we conducted several laboratory tests in which the time elapsed between the addition of solidifying agent to soil and crushing was varied. The test results showed that the strength of crushed solidified soil could be estimated from the strength of solidified soil. Also, the tests showed that the <b>cone</b> index of <b>crushed</b> solidified soil is greatly affected by the time elapsed between the addition of solidifying agents and crushing. However, unconfined compressive strength, cohesion and California Bearing Ratio (CBR) of crushed solidified soil did not greatly change from one day of elapsed time onward...|$|R

40|$|The Upper Paleolithic site of Vale Boi in coastal, southwestern Portugal {{currently}} {{represents the}} earliest known case of grease-rendering in Eurasia, with initial occupation occurring during the early Gravettian at ~ 27, 000 BP. Long-term exploitation of marine resources is indicated by marine shellfish remains, mainly {{in the form of}} limpets (Patella), recovered from all three cultural periods (Gravettian, Solutrean and Magdalenian). High-level exploitation of rabbits (Oryctolagus) began with initial use of the site and continued throughout the occupations, with a possible increase in intensity {{at the onset of the}} Solutrean. Grease-rendering of red deer (Cervus elaphus), horse (Equus caballus), European ass (Equus hydruntinus) and aurochs (Bos primigenius) bones was identified through multi-dimensional taphonomic and zooarchaeological analyses. Ungulate remains demonstrated extensive fragmentation and abundant evidence of impact features such as <b>cone</b> fractures, <b>crushing,</b> denting and cracking. The intensity of fragmentation and impact damage to red deer remains is significantly correlated with quantities of marrow and bone grease within these portions. Lack of density-mediated attrition of either the leporid remains or the cranial bone of red deer and horse, demonstrates that the loss of low-density, grease-rich post-cranial skeletal portions is due to human subsistence activities. Balanced body-part representation of ungulates indicates that density-mediated attrition of post-cranial elements is not related to differential transport of carcass portions. Comparison of element portion frequencies to food utility indices further demonstrates that humans were systematically harvesting marrow and bone grease throughout the Gravettian, Solutrean and Magdalenian culture periods. The co-occurrence of fire-cracked rock, stone anvils and hammerstones corroborates this suggestion. Although grease rendering at Vale Boi pre-dates other known sites in Eurasia by several thousand years, faunal assemblages in southeastern Spain indicate that resource diversification and intensification appeared there coevally with Vale Boi. The persistence and continued intensification of subsistence practices throughout the Upper Paleolithic suggests a sustained depression of large game in relation to human populations. This was likely due to patchy, spatially-restricted resources, resulting in territorial circumscription. Only through technological innovation and novel approaches to resource harvesting, were foragers able to maintain and ultimately expand their populations in southern Iberia...|$|R
40|$|With {{almost all}} {{infrastructures}} being {{dependent on the}} supply of crushed rock materials, minerals, and ores, {{it is fair to}} say that the foundation of modern society is literally built upon these materials. As society continues to develop and standards of living progressively increase, the subsequent growing demand for crushed rock materials, minerals, and ores will result in a need for improving the performance and efficiency of rock crushing equipment. The main hypothesis of this research is that better crushing machines can be achieved by first optimizing a given crushing process theoretically, and then designing the actual crusher. The conducted research can therefore be divided into five main stages, namely rock material characterization, modeling, optimization, evaluation, and implementation. In this thesis, the complex compressive breakage behaviors of four different rock materials (i. e. gneiss, diabase, marble, and quartzite) and two different iron ores were experimentally studied and mathematically modeled. A genetic algorithm was also applied to theoretically optimize the compressive crushing of these rock materials and ores. The obtained results indicated that optimal compressive crushing differs depending on the application and optimization objective. Different types of crushing applications, such aggregate and mining, should therefore not be operated in the same way. Similarly, crushing applications with different optimization objectives, e. g. the same type of application but different production situations, should not be run identically. Analyses also showed that existing <b>cone</b> crushers and <b>crushing</b> applications are not operating optimally. In fact, defined theoretical performance efficiencies of 30 - 40 % were calculated for studied aggregate applications. These numbers indicate great improvement potential despite possible mechanical and practical restraints. More specifically, comparison between existing cone crushers and theoretical crushing concepts showed that the implementation of optimization results can be more or less difficult depending on the type of crusher. For aggregate applications, the optimization results particularly suggested that rock materials are currently being over-crushed, and that the size reduction process should be separated from the process of particle shaping. In comparison, the results for mining applications indicated that a larger amount of size reduction should be performed by single particle crushing, if the overall size reduction of the process is to be maximized and the energy consumption is to be kept to a minimum. These optimization results for both aggregate and mining applications were implemented in prototypes, which were then tested in full scale experiments. The subsequent analysis of the results indicated that the performance of cone crushers can be improved in terms of product yield as well as reduction ratio. In conclusion, considering the variety of applications as well as rock materials, minerals and ores, a truly optimal performance of a crushing application must be based on an optimized crusher design as well as a continuously optimized crusher operation...|$|R

50|$|Milling is {{the process}} by which {{materials}} are reduced from a large size to a smaller size. Milling may involve breaking up cemented material (in which case individual particles retain their shape) or pulverization (which involves grinding the particles themselves to a smaller size).

Attrition milling equipment includes the wet scrubber (also called the planetary mill or wet attrition mill), which has paddles in water creating vortexes in which the material collides and break up. Compression mills include the jaw crusher, roller crusher and <b>cone</b> <b>crusher.</b> Impact mills include the ball mill, which has media that tumble and fracture the material.

5000|$|There {{are several}} methods of comminution. Comminution of solid {{materials}} requires {{different types of}} crushers and mills depending on the feed properties such as hardness at various size ranges and application requirements such as throughput and maintenance. The most common machines for the comminution of coarse feed material are the jaw crusher (1m > P80 > 100 mm), <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> (P80 > 20 mm) and hammer crusher. Primary jaw crusher product in intermediate feed particle size ranges (100mm > P80 > 20mm) can be ground in Autogenous or Semi-Autogenous (AG or SAG) mills depending on feed properties and application requirements. For comminution of finer particle size ranges (20mm > P80 > 30 μm) machines like the ball mill, vertical roller mill, hammer mill, roller press or high compression roller mill, vibration mill, jet mill and others are used. For yet finer grind sizes (sometimes referred to as [...] "ultrafine grinding"), specialist mills such as the IsaMillTM are used.|$|E
