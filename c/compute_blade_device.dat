5000|$|Building on the modular {{expansion}} {{capabilities of}} the <b>compute</b> <b>blade,</b> the storage blade enabled customers to add up to eight 2.5" [...] SATA HDDs or four 3.5" [...] SATA HDDs to a separate, but physically connected, single-width blade add-on. This bolted on expansion took {{the place of the}} default blade cover and extended the blade unit to a two-width module. From a computational standpoint, the storage blade was no different from the <b>compute</b> <b>blade,</b> offering the same Intel processor options. Unlike the <b>compute</b> <b>blade,</b> PCIe expansion was not available in the storage blade, as the RAID card supporting the additional hard drives occupied this port.|$|R

50|$|Two {{types of}} node, {{processor}} and memory, were contained within a <b>blade.</b> <b>Compute</b> <b>blades</b> contain a processor node and consist of two PAC611 sockets for Itanium 2 and Itanium microprocessors, a Super-Hub (SHub) {{application-specific integrated circuit}} (ASIC) (chipset) and eight dual in-line memory module (DIMM) slots for memory.

As an example, we demonstrate that with only one <b>computing</b> <b>blade,</b> the platform can handle the real time tomography needs of NFIRAOS, the Thirty-Meter Telescope first light facility Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics system. The High-Performance FPGA platform is integrated with Board Software Development Kit to provide a complete and fully tested set of interfaces to access the hardware resources.

40|$|A steady, {{three-dimensional}} viscous average passage {{computer code}} {{is used to}} analyze the flow through a compact radial turbine rotor. The code models the flow as spatially periodic from blade passage to blade passage. Results from the code using varying computational models are compared {{with each other and with}} experimental data. These results include blade surface velocities and pressures, exit vorticity and entropy contour plots, shroud pressures, and spanwise exit total temperature, total pressure, and swirl distributions. The three computational models used are inviscid, viscous with no blade clearance, and viscous with blade clearance. It is found that modeling viscous effects improves correlation with experimental data, while modeling hub and tip clearances further improves some comparisons. Experimental results such as a local maximum of exit swirl, reduced exit total pressures at the walls, and exit total temperature magnitudes are explained by interpretation of the flow physics and computed secondary flows.
