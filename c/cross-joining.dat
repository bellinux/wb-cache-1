40|$|Abstract. Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) are {{the main}} {{building}} block of many classical stream ciphers; however due to their inherent linearity, most of the LFSR-based designs do not offer the desired security levels. In the last decade, using Nonlinear Feedback Shift Registers (NFSRs) in stream ciphers became very popular. However, the theory of NFSRs is not well-understood, {{and there is no}} efficient method that constructs a cryptographically strong feedback function with maximum period and also, given a feedback function it is hard to predict the period. In this paper, we study the maximum-length NFSRs, focusing on the nonlinearity of their feedback functions. First, we provide some upper bounds on the nonlinearity of the maximum-length feedback functions, and then we study the feedback functions having nonlinearity 2 in detail. We also show some techniques to improve the nonlinearity of a given feedback function using <b>cross-joining.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} constructing n-stage Galois NLFSRs with period 2 n − 1 from n-stage maximum length LFSRs. We introduce nonlinearity into state cycles by adding a nonlinear Boolean function to the feedback polynomial of the LFSR. Each assignment of variables for which this function evaluates to 1 acts as a crossing point for the LFSR state cycle. By adding {{a copy of the}} same function to a later stage of the register, we cancel the effect of nonlinearity and join the state cycles back. The presented method requires no extra time steps and it has a smaller area overhead compared to the previous approaches based on <b>cross-join</b> pairs. It is feasible for large n. However, it has a number of limitations. One is that the resulting NLFSRs can have at most ⌊n/ 2 ⌋- 1 stages with a nonlinear update. Another is that feedback functions depend only on state variables which are updated linearly. The latter implies that sequences generated by the presented method can also be generated using a nonlinear filter generator. ...|$|R
