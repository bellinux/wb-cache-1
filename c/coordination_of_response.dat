40|$|An {{evaluation}} by the Office of Development Effectiveness of Australia’s {{response to the}} Horn of Africa humanitarian crisis, 2011. Foreword This report identifies many strengths of the Australian response to the humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa in 2011. At the time, humanitarian operations in severely affected areas were fraught with danger and were extremely difficult. Australia was a new player compared to other donors {{with years of experience}} in the region and a much larger presence on the ground. The Australian aid program responded quickly, despite limited capacity and experience in the region. The speed and flexibility of operations were notable strengths of the Australian response. Australian funds clearly saved lives; however, the results depended on more than funds alone. Effective <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> efforts is a persistent challenge for the global humanitarian system. Australia’s role in influencing implementing partners and coordinating important aspects of the overall system increased the effectiveness of Australian assistance, and the overall international response. Another clear finding is the need for funded agencies to improve reporting on activities and results. The reporting is essential for learning and to ensure informed decisions are made. The evaluation recommendations in areas such as these are designed to improve the effectiveness of Australian humanitarian assistance in the future. Finally, the evaluation highlights the complexity of disaster situations, which are growing in number and severity and will continue to pose a challenge for Australia in their commitment to supporting humanitarian work in the Indo-Pacific...|$|E
40|$|Tendons {{respond to}} {{mechanical}} load by modifying their extracellular matrix. The cells therefore sense mechanical load and coordinate an appropriate response to it. We show that tendon cells {{have the potential}} to communicate with one another via cell processes and gap junctions and thus could use direct cell/cell communication to detect and/or coordinate their load responses. Unfixed cryosections of adult rat digital flexor tendons were stained with the fluorescent membrane dye DiI to demonstrate cell shape. Similar sections were immunolabelled with monoclonal antibodies to rat connexin 32 or connexin 43 to demonstrate gap junctions and counterstained with propidium iodide to show nuclei, or the membrane stain DiOC 7 to show cell membranes. Sections were examined with a laser scanning confocal microscope and 3 -dimensional reconstructions were prepared from optical section series to demonstrate cell shape and the position of connexin immunolabel. Cells had a complex interconnected morphology with gap junctions at points of contact with other cells. Cell bodies contained the nucleus and extended broad flat lateral cell processes that enclosed collagen bundles and interacted with similar processes from adjacent cells. They also had long thin longitudinal processes interacting with the cell process network further along the tendon. Connexin 43 occurred where cell processes met and between cell bodies, whereas connexin 32 was only found between cell bodies. The results indicate the presence of a 3 -dimensional communicating network of cell processes within tendons. The intimate relationship between cell processes and collagen fibril bundles suggests that the cell process network could be involved in load sensing and <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> to load. The presence of 2 different types of connexins suggests that there could be at least 2 distinct communicating networks...|$|E

40|$|The World Food Programme (WFP) is the United Nations {{humanitarian}} organization {{responsible for}} the rapid intervention and long-term assistance {{in the event of}} a food crisis. The GIS and Remote Sensing unit in WFP actively supports the various humanitarian emergencies: floods, droughts, cyclones and socio-political events are classic examples of situations faced by WFP with the support of GIS and Remote Sensing. The Geographic Information Systems, associated with the increasing use of global positioning systems and remote sensing data have become an invaluable tool for preparedness to natural disasters, in the <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> actions and for planning of development interventions. The objective of the research is to put in place a more robust, targeted and standardized training framework through which capacity building activities in the field of Geomatics can be better prioritized and implemented according to the needs, ensuring its alignment with the Organization's broader strategic priorities (1. Prepare for and respond to shocks; 2. Restore and rebuild lives and livelihoods; and 3. reduce vulnerability and build lasting resilience.) The organization is evolving towards more targeted geospatial analyses in response to the shift from food aid to food assistance, demanding a much greater analytical work and engagement between WFP key functions, as well as requiring a series of additional information sets to better inform the targeting of areas for food assistance. As a result, the GIS and Remote Sensing skills required for meeting such objectives are much greater and the organization needs to ensure the staff will meet them satisfactorily; therefore there was the needs to revise the existing trainings to better align them with the current organizational goals. So far WFP has been covering trainings needs and demands throughout the world in a disordered fashion and despite the need for GIS expertise in the field, the trainings performed have so far not been systematically implemented. The methodology applied for identifying the capacity building requirements needed for achieving the goals defined in the GIS Strategy consists on a Training Need Analysis (TNA). The TNA provides a systematic investigation of training needs within the organization, and the trainings designed will be reviewed on regular basis to ensure the provision remain relevant to the objective...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Two crucial {{biological}} processes are (1) the sensing and <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> to low oxygen levels and (2) {{the control of}} food intake and energy expenditure. The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family of proteins is known to regulate responses to low oxygen, whereas neuropeptides derived from proopiomelanocortin (POMC) are implicated in the control of food intake and energy expenditure. It is now becoming apparent that these two apparently disparate processes may be linked, with the exciting discovery that HIF proteins can act in the brain to regulate food intake and energy expenditure {{as reported in the}} current issue of PLoS Biology.

40|$|Subjects were scanned with PET {{while they}} learned a complex {{arbitrary}} rhythm, paced by visual cues. In the comparison condition, the intervals were varied randomly. The behavioral {{results showed that}} the subjects decreased their response time with training, thus becoming more accurate in responding to the pacing cues at the appropriate time. There were learning-related increases in the posterior lateral cerebellum (lobule HVIIa), intraparietal and medial parietal cortex, presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA), and lateral premotor cortex. Learning-related decreases were found in the prestriate and inferior temporal cortex, suggesting that with practice the subjects increasingly came to depend on internal rather than external cues to time their responses. There were no learning-related increases in the basal ganglia.

40|$|Plants are {{necessarily}} highly competitive and have finely tuned mechanisms to adjust {{growth and development}} in accordance with opportunities and limitations in their environment. Sugars from photosynthesis form {{an integral part of}} this growth control process, acting as both an energy source and as signaling molecules in areas targeted for growth. The plant hormone auxin similarly functions as a signaling molecule and a driver of growth and developmental processes. Here, we show that not only do the two act in concert but that auxin metabolism is itself regulated by the availability of free sugars. The regulation of the biosynthesis and degradation of the main auxin, indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA), by sugars requires changes in the expression of multiple genes and metabolites linked to several IAA biosynthetic pathways. The induction also involves members of the recently described central regulator PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR transcription factor family.
