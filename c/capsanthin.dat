In order to combine the benefits of both and to produce capsanthin-rich avocado oil using a clean extraction technology, freeze-dried avocado and red bell pepper pulps were separately packaged in a single fixed bed extractor, in which supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)) was passed through the bed at 50 degrees C and 400 bar. The target compounds were simultaneously extracted from both sources, the first source containing lipids and the second source rich in <b>capsanthin.</b> The scCO(2) passed first through the avocado pulp containing 68 % lipids, and then that were passed through the red bell pepper pulp contained 625 mu g/g <b>capsanthin.</b> Lipids extracted in the first bed served as co-solvent with CO 2 in the extraction of <b>capsanthin</b> in the second bed. An extract consisting of intensely red-colored oil containing 280 - 460 mu g/g <b>capsanthin</b> was obtained. In the process, around 88 % avocado oil and from 30 % to 50 % <b>capsanthin</b> from red bell pepper were extracted.

By using cDNA-AFLP under fruits shading, a fragment related to fruit color was obtained. Next, the full-length coding sequence of the gene was cloned from the fruits of pepper. Homologous gene alignment confirmed that the gene has high homology with the rbcL gene, named CarbcL.

The main focus is on carotenoid and tocopherol composition as the quality attributes of technological and nutritional interest. The maximum oil yield is 7. 2 and 8. 8 g per 100 g paprika with SF-CO 2 and subcritical propane, respectively. For the implementation of complete extraction at the given conditions, the ratio of solvent to solid {{is found to be}} 6. 0 and 1. 0 using SF-CO 2 and propane, respectively.

40|$|Structural {{evidence}} has accumulated suggesting that fusion and/or translocation factors {{are involved in}} plastid membrane biogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we have developed an in vitro {{system in which the}} extent of fusion and/or translocation is monitored by the conversion of the xanthophyll epoxide (antheraxanthin) into the red ketocarotenoid (<b>capsanthin).</b> Only chromoplast membrane vesicles from red pepper fruits (Capsicum annuum) contain the required enzyme. Vesicles prepared from the mutant yellow cultivar are devoid of this enzyme and accumulate antheraxanthin. The fusion and/or translocation activity is characterized by complementation due to the synthesis of <b>capsanthin</b> and the parallel decrease of antheraxanthin when the two types of vesicles are incubated together in the presence of plastid stroma. We show that the extent of conversion is dependent upon an ATP-requiring protein that is sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide. Further purification and immunological analysis have revealed that the active factor, designated plastid fusion and/or translocation factor (Pftf), resides in a protein of 72 kDa. cDNA cloning revealed that mature Pftf has significant homology to yeast and animal (NSF) or bacterial (Ftsh) proteins involved in vesicle fusion or membrane protein translocation...|$|E

40|$|Tomato flowers (Solanum lycopersicum) {{were used}} as a model system to {{investigate}} flower color modification by alteration of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, due to their ease of transformation and short time from seed to flowering. Tomato flowers are naturally bright yellow, primarily due to the accumulation of violaxanthin. Violaxanthin is a precursor of capsanthin-capsorubin synthase (ccs), which catalyzes the conversion of antheraxanthin and violaxanthin, two yellow xanthophylls, into <b>capsanthin</b> and capsorubin, two red κ-xanthophylls, respectively. A capsanthin-capsorubin synthase gene cloned from tiger lily (Lilium lancifolium) was expressed in tomatoes {{under the control of}} the promoter from a petunia chalcone synthase gene, fused to an enhancer sequence of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter. All transgenic lines produced flowers with a light orange pigmentation, as opposed to the natural yellow coloration. UHPLC analysis confirmed that the color change coincided with the accumulation of two novel carotenoids, <b>capsanthin</b> and a capsanthin-like carotenoid. A more pronounced color change likely could have been achieved using a stronger promoter or by down-regulating competing pathways. Nevertheless, these results indicate that alteration of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway with a gene for capsanthin-capsorubin synthase is a possible strategy for producing novel red and orange hues in certain ornamental crops...|$|E

40|$|The later {{steps of}} {{carotenoid}} biosynthesis involve {{the formation of}} cyclic carotenoids. The reaction is catalyzed by lycopene β-cyclase (LCY-B), which converts lycopene into β-carotene, and by capsanthin-capsorubin synthase (CCS), which is mainly dedicated to the synthesis of κ-cyclic carotenoids (<b>capsanthin</b> and capsorubin) but also has LCY-B activity. Although the peptide sequences of plant LCY-Bs and CCS contain a putative dinucleotide-binding motif, {{it is believed that}} these two carotenoid cyclases proceed via protic activation and stabilization of resulting carbocation intermediates. Using pepper (Capsicum annuum) CCS as a prototypic carotenoid cyclase, we show that the monomeric protein contains one noncovalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) that is essential for enzyme activity only in the presence of NADPH, which functions as the FAD reductant. The reaction proceeds without transfer of hydrogen from the dinucleotide cofactors to β-carotene or <b>capsanthin.</b> Using site-directed mutagenesis, amino acids potentially involved in the protic activation were identified. Substitutions of alanine, lysine, and arginine for glutamate- 295 in the conserved 293 -FLEET- 297 motif of pepper CCS or LCY-B abolish the formation of β-carotene and κ-cyclic carotenoids. We also found that mutations of the equivalent glutamate- 196 located in the 194 -LIEDT- 198 domain of structurally divergent bacterial LCY-B abolish the formation of β-carotene. The data herein reveal plant carotenoid cyclases to be novel enzymes that combine characteristics of non-metal-assisted terpene cyclases with those attributes typically found in flavoenzymes that catalyze reactions, with no net redox, such as type 2 isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase. Thus, FAD in its reduced form could be implicated in the stabilization of the carbocation intermediate...|$|E

Although the provitamin A keto-carotenoids from sapote were highly bioaccessible, their qualitative and quantitative in vivo bioavailability and their conversion to vitamin A remains to be confirmed.

40|$|The {{pericarp}} of Capsicum {{fruit is}} a rich dietary source of carotenoids. Accumulation of these compounds may be controlled, in part, by gene transcription of biosynthetic enzymes. The carotenoid composition {{in a number of}} orange-coloured C. annuum cultivars was determined using HPLC and compared with transcript abundances for four carotenogenic enzymes, Psy, LcyB, CrtZ- 2, and Ccs determined by qRT-PCR. There were unique carotenoid profiles as well as distinct patterns of transcription of carotenogenic enzymes within the seven orange-coloured cultivars. In one cultivar, ‘Fogo’, carrying the mutant ccs- 3 allele, transcripts were detected for this gene, but no CCS protein accumulated. The premature stop termination in ccs- 3 prevented expression of the biosynthetic activity to synthesize the <b>capsanthin</b> and capsorubin forms of carotenoids. In two other orange-coloured cultivars, ‘Orange Grande ’ and ‘Oriole’, both with wild-type versions of all four carotenogenic enzymes, no transcripts for Ccs were detected and no red pigments accumulated. Finally, in a third case, the orange-coloured cultivar, Canary, transcripts for all four of the wild-type carotenogenic enzymes were readily detected yet no CCS protein appeared to accumulate and no red carotenoids were synthesized. In the past, mutations in Psy and Ccs have been identified as the loci controlling colour in the fruit. Now there is evidence that a non-structural gene may control colour development in Capsicum...|$|E
40|$|Chilli (Capsicum annum L.) {{belongs to}} the family {{solanaceae}} is mainly cultivated for its vegetable green fruits and dry chilli as the spice. It {{is believed to be}} originated from South America. It is a rich source of Vitamin C, A and B. Chilli is valued for pungency which is imparted by an alkaloid, Capsaicin and the red pigments (<b>Capsanthin,</b> Capsorubin and Capxanthin). Chillies are widely used as spice, condiment, culinary, supplement, medicine, vegetable and are ornamental plants too. It is an important food flavouring ingredient for flavouring many vegetarian and non-vegetarian food products. In view of its multifarious uses, the demand for chillies has been on the increase world over. In India it is an important cash crop, which is grown for the domestic market and for export. In India, chillies are grown in almost all states of the country and the major growing states in terms of production are Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Orissa, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. There are several varieties of chilli cultivated in India. The most popular among these are, Sannam, LC 334, Byadagi, Wonderhot, Jwala etc. The crop suffers from many diseases like damping off, anthracnose or fruit rot or dieback, wilt, leaf spots and powdery mildew. Among the fungal diseases, root rot of chilli caused by Sclerotium rolfsii has attained the economic importance. In recent years, this disease is causing the economic losses in chillies crop (Kalmesh and Gurjar 2001). The disease In India the root rot caused by this pathogen was first time reported by Shaw and Ajrekar (1915) who had isolated th...|$|E
40|$|The {{manuscript}} {{presents the}} development of a new reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) photo diode array detection method allowing the separation and quantification of 15 carotenoids (adonirubin, adonixanthin, astaxanthin, astaxanthin dimethyl disuccinate, asteroidenone, beta-apo- 8 '-carotenal, beta-apo- 8 '-carotenoic acid ethyl ester, beta-carotene, canthaxanthin, <b>capsanthin,</b> citranaxanthin, echinenone, lutein, lycopene, and zeaxanthin), 10 of which are feed additives authorised within the European Union. The developed method allows for the reliable determination of the total carotenoid content in one run using the corresponding E-isomer as calibration standard while taking into account the E/Z-isomers composition. This is a key criterion for the application of the method, since for most of the analytes included in this study analytical standards are only available for the E-isomers. This goal was achieved by applying the isosbestic concept, in order to identify specific wavelengths, at which the absorption coefficients are identical for all stereoisomers concerned. The second target referred to the optimisation of the LC conditions. By means of an experimental design, an optimised RP-HPLC method was developed allowing for a sufficient chromatographic separation of all carotenoids. The selected method uses a Suplex pKb- 100 HPLC column and applying a gradient with a mixture of acetonitrile, tert-butyl-methyl ether and water as mobile phases. The limits of detection and limits of quantification ranged from 0. 06 mg L− 1 to 0. 14 mg L− 1 and from 0. 20 mg L− 1 to 0. 48 mg L− 1, respectively. JRC. D. 5 -Standards for Food Bioscienc...|$|E
