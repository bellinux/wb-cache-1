40|$|<b>Carbonaceous</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> (PM), {{comprising}} {{black carbon}} (BC), primary organic aerosol (POA) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA, from atmospheric aging of precursors), {{is a highly}} toxic vehicle exhaust component. Therefore, understanding vehicle pollution requires knowledge of both primary emissions, and how these emissions age in the atmosphere. We provide a systematic examination of carbonaceous PM emissions and parameterisation of SOA formation from modern diesel and gasoline cars at different temperatures (22, − 7 [*]°C) during controlled laboratory experiments. Carbonaceous PM emission and SOA formation is markedly higher from gasoline than diesel particle filter (DPF) and catalyst-equipped diesel cars, more so at − 7 [*]°C, contrasting with nitrogen oxides (NOX). Higher SOA formation from gasoline cars and primary emission reductions for diesels implies gasoline cars will increasingly dominate vehicular total carbonaceous PM, though older non-DPF-equipped diesels will continue to dominate the primary fraction for some time. Supported by state-of-the-art source apportionment of ambient fossil fuel derived PM, our results show that whether gasoline or diesel cars are more polluting depends on the pollutant in question, i. e. that diesel cars are not necessarily worse polluters than gasoline cars.

Objective: Using the carbon content of airway macrophages as a marker of individual exposure to particulate matter derived from fossil fuel, we sought direct evidence for this association. Methods: 300 children from puffed rice industrial areas and 300 children from population living in green zone were selected randomly. Airway macrophages were obtained from healthy children through sputum induction, and the grading of ultrafine carbon particles in airway macrophages was measured. Pulmonary function was also measured by spirometry. Results: Pulmonary function tests showed that in industrial area 42. 6 % and 20. 3 % of children had moderate obstructive airway disease and restrictive airway disease, respectively. In the green zone area, 7 % of children had obstructive airway disease and 6 % had restrictive airway disease. Evaluation of airway macrophages for ultrafine carbon particles revealed that in industrial area there were ultrafine carbon particles of grade 2 in 23 % of subjects and grade 3 in 8. 33 % of individuals with obstructive airway disease. In the green zone area, the rates were 1. 67 % and 0. 7 %, respectively.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations were measured (by GC/MS) and compared for these soot PMs, including PAH diagnostic ratios; and these data were compared with outdoor filter collection PM data for El Paso, TX, and a dozen other cities and regions world wide. TPM was observed to contain a wide range of PAHs with high concentrations (from naphthalene to dibenz[a,h]anthracene (MW 128 - 278)) while DPM and WPM contained lesser concentrations and a smaller PAH range. Candle and natural gas PM as well as commercial BC and carbon nanotube aggregates contained only small concentrations of low MW PAHs. An analysis of PAH carcinogenicity either as a carcinogenicity index or a potency equivalency factor from literature data indicated that only the TPM PAH content would pose any significant long term, carcinogenicity threat.

The links between components and hospitalizations have rarely been examined in Asia. We estimated associations between exposures to 18 chemical components of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm (PM 10) and daily emergency cardiorespiratory hospitalizations in Hong Kong, China, between 2001 and 2007. <b>Carbonaceous</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter,</b> sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium accounted for two-thirds of the PM 10 mass. After adjustment for time-varying confounders, a 3. 4 -μg/m 3 increment in 2 -day moving average of same-day and previous-day nitrate concentrations was associated with the largest increase of 1. 32 % (95 % confidence interval: 0. 73, 1. 92) in cardiovascular hospitalizations; elevation in manganese level (0. 02 μg/m 3) was linked to a 0. 91 % (95 % confidence interval: 0. 19, 1. 64) increase in respiratory hospitalizations. Upon further adjustment for gaseous copollutants, nitrate, sodium ion, chloride ion, magnesium, and nickel remained significantly associated with cardiovascular hospitalizations, whereas sodium ion, aluminum, and magnesium, components abundantly found in coarser PM 10, were associated with respiratory hospitalizations.

However, {{the relationship between}} markers of PM exposure and the quantity of particles entering the paediatric airway is unclear. The hypothesis was that, the carbon in alveolar macrophages (AM) reflects individual exposure of healthy children to PM. The aim was to quantify carbon in AM in extreme (biomass smoke) and with fossil fuel exposure. For fossil fuel exposure the aim was also to establish the relationship between median carbon loading per AM per child and: i) markers of exposures at the home address and ii) lung function iii) markers of airway inflammation. Healthy children were recruited from schools. Exercise parameters recorded. Environmental smoke exposure was excluded by salivary cotinine. AM were sampled by induced sputum. Median carbon area was determined by image analysis of digitized light microscopic images of AM. The median area of AM carbon was higher in Ethiopian women compared with UK adults, (p = 0. 0002). Median carbon area in Ethiopian children was higher than UK children (p = 0. 0002).

Sixteen small scale combustion experiments near the laboratory of radiometry at INPE were performed to obtain the coefficient that relates the consumption of biomass with the ERF released. The MOD 14 /MYD 14, MOD 04 /MYD 04 and WFABBA products were utilized to calculate the total amount of gases and aerosols emitted to the atmosphere. The methods that use the FRE to estimate the emission of gases and aerosols were modeled using CCATT-BRAMS (Coupled Chemistry-Aerosol-Tracer Transport model coupled to Brazilian Regional Atmospheric Modeling System) and evaluated via data obtained from field experiments in the LBA SMOCC/RaCCI. The application of the methods to estimate the emission of PM 2, 5 ìm and CO modeled in the CCATT-BRAMS showed similar results, however, the coefficients of determination and correlation values were greater than 0. 70 and 80 %, respectively.

Additionally, parallel ∼ 50 -day time series of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), water-insoluble organic carbon (WIOC), and elemental carbon (EC) were quantified at time increments of 4 – 24 h in the surface snow. Measurement of atmospheric particulate carbon found WSOC (average of 52 ng m− 3) to constitute a major fraction of particulate OC (average of 56 ng m− 3), suggesting that atmospheric organic compounds reaching the Greenland Ice Sheet in summer are highly oxidized.

Comparing surface snow to atmospheric particulate matter concentrations, it appears the snow has a much higher OC (WSOC+WIOC) to EC ratio (205 : 1) than air (10 : 1), suggesting that snow is additionally influenced by water-soluble gas-phase compounds.

The 60 daily samples have been collected simultaneously in all sites during 10 consecutive days for 6 months (April, June, August, October, December and February). OC ranged from 0. 98 to 22. 34 μg/m 3, while the mean value was 5. 5 μg/m 3, contributing 79 % of total carbon. EC concentrations fluctuated from 0. 19 to 11. 90 μg/m 3 with an annual mean value of 1. 31 μg/m 3 (19 % of the total carbon). The monthly OC concentration gradually increased from April to December. The EC did not vary in accordance with OC. However the highest values for both parameters were recorded in the cold period. The mean OC/EC ratio is 4. 54, which {{is higher than the}} values observed in most of the other European cities. The secondary organic carbon (SOC) contributed for 69 % of the total OC and this was confirmed by both the approaches OC/EC minimum ratio and regression. The results show that OC, EC and SOC exhibited higher concentration during winter months in all measurement sites, suggesting that the stable atmosphere and lower mixing play important role for the accumulation of air pollutant and hasten the condensation or adsorption of volatile organic compounds over the Veneto region. Significant meteorological factors controlling OC and EC were investigated by fitting linear models and using a robust procedure based on weighted likelihood, suggesting that low wind speed and temperature favour accumulation of emissions from local sources.

PGE 2 10 (- 6) M, but not PGD 2 10 (- 6) M, suppressed phagocytosis of PM 10 by human macrophages in vitro (p< 0. 05 vs control). PGE 2 10 (- 6) M also suppressed phagocytosis of PM 10 by rat AM in vitro (p< 0. 01 vs control). CONCLUSIONS: Phagocytosis of inhaled carbonaceous PM by AMs is impaired in severe asthma. PGE 2 may contribute to impaired AM phagocytic function in severe asthma. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies {{indirectly}} {{suggest that}} the inhalation of <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> impairs lung function in children. Using the carbon content of airway macrophages as a marker of individual exposure to particulate matter derived from fossil fuel, we sought direct evidence of this association. METHODS: Airway macrophages were obtained from healthy children through sputum induction, and the area of airway macrophages occupied by carbon was measured. Lung function was measured {{with the use of}} spirometry. We modeled the exposure to primary particulate matter (PM) that is less than 10 mum in aerodynamic diameter (PM 10) at or near each child's home address. Linear regression was used to evaluate associations between carbon content of alveolar macrophages and variables that may affect individual exposure. To determine whether lung function that is reduced for other reasons is associated with an increase in the carbon content of airway macrophages, we also studied children with severe asthma. RESULTS: We were able to assess the carbon content of airway macrophages in 64 of 114 healthy children (56 percent). Each increase in primary PM 10 of 1. 0 microg per cubic meter was associated with an increase of 0. 10 microm 2 (95 percent confidence interval, 0. 01 to 0. 18) in the carbon content of airway macrophages, and each increase of 1. 0 microm 2 in carbon content was associated with a reduction of 17 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 5. 6 to 28. 4 percent) in forced expiratory volume in one second, of 12. 9 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0. 9 to 24. 8 percent) in forced vital capacity, and of 34. 7 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 11. 3 to 58. 1 percent) in the forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75 percent of the forced vital capacity. The carbon content of airway macrophages was lower in children with asthma than in healthy children. CONCLUSIONS: There is a dose-dependent inverse association between the carbon content of airway macrophages and lung function in children. We found no evidence that reduced lung function itself causes an increase in carbon content. Peer-reviewedPublisher Versio...|$|E

40|$|During {{a period}} of two years, organic and {{inorganic}} suspended <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> and phytoplankton biomass was frequently measured in Lake Erken, a moderately deep, eutrophic lake in south-eastern Sweden. Regression analyses of these data were used to differentiate and quantify newly produced planktonic <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> (zooplankton + phytoplankton + bacteria) and different types of resuspended <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> (organic, inorganic). Resuspended <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> was frequently dominant in the water column (yearly mean 59 % of suspended <b>particulate</b> <b>matter),</b> and resuspended <b>particulate</b> organic <b>matter</b> ranged from 11 to 99 % of suspended <b>particulate</b> organic <b>matter</b> (yearly mean: 40 %). The high amount of resuspended <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> originates from erosion/transportation bottoms which are located at water depths above 16 m and which cover 93 % of the lake area. Resuspended <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> was significantly related to diatom biomass but not to any other type of planktonic biomass. Consequently, the seasonal variations in the amount and distribution of diatoms {{can be explained by the}} hydrodynamic processes which affect the amount and distribution of resuspended <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> while seasonal variations in the amount and distribution of other planktonic biomass need further explanations, like active swimming, floating and grazing resistance...|$|R
40|$|The {{quantification}} of <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> {{emissions from}} mineral handling {{is an important}} problem for the quantification of global emissions on industrial sites. Mineral <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> emissions could adversely impact environmental quality in mining regions, transport regions, and even on a global scale. Mineral loading is an important process contributing to mineral <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> emissions, especially under weak wind conditions. Mathematical models are effective ways to evaluate <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> emissions during the mineral loading process. The currently used empirical models based on {{the form of a}} power function do not predict <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> emissions accurately under weak wind conditions. At low <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> emissions, the models overestimated, and at high <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> emissions, the models underestimated emission factors. We conducted wind tunnel experiments to evaluate the <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> emission factors for the mineral loading process. A new approach based on the mathematical form of a logistical function was developed and tested.

40|$|We {{present a}} new mobile {{environmental}} reaction chamber for the simulation of the atmospheric aging of aerosols from different emissions sources without limitation from the instruments or facilities available at any single site. The chamber can be {{mounted on a}} trailer for transport to host facilities or for mobile measurements. Photochemistry is simulated using a set of 40 UV lights (total power 4 KW). Characterisation of the emission spectrum of these lights shows that atmospheric photochemistry can be accurately simulated over a range of temperatures from − 7 – 25 °C. A photolysis rate of NO 2 , JNO 2 , of (8. 0 &plusmn; 0. 7) &times; 10 − 3 molecules cm− 3 s− 1 was determined at 25 °C. Further, we present the first application of the mobile chamber and demonstrate its utility by quantifying primary organic aerosol (POA) emission and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production from a Euro 5 light duty gasoline vehicle. Exhaust emissions were sampled during the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), the standard driving cycle for European regulatory purposes, and injected into the chamber. The relative concentrations of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and total hydrocarbon (THC) during the aging of emissions inside the chamber were controlled using an injection system developed {{as a part of}} the new mobile chamber set up. Total OA (POA + SOA) emission factors of (370 &plusmn; 18) &times; 10 &minus; 3 g kg&minus; 1 fuel, or (14. 6 &plusmn; 0. 8) &times; 10 &minus; 3 g km&minus; 1 , after aging, were calculated from concentrations measured inside the smog chamber during two experiments. The average SOA/POA ratio for the two experiments was 15. 1, a much larger increase than has previously been seen for diesel vehicles, where smog chamber studies have found SOA/POA ratios of 1. 3 – 1. 7. Due to this SOA formation, <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> (PM) emissions from a gasoline vehicle may approach those of a diesel vehicle of the same class. Furthermore, with the advent of emission controls requiring the use of diesel particle filters, gasoline vehicle emissions could become a far larger source of ambient PM than diesel vehicles. Therefore this large increase in the PM mass of gasoline vehicle aerosol emissions due to SOA formation has significant implications for our understanding of the contribution of on-road vehicles to ambient aerosols and merits further study...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSeveral {{methods of}} {{extraction}} were optimized to extract polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), their nitrated derivatives and heavy n-alkanes from a highly adsorptive particulate matter resulting from the combustion of diesel fuel in a diesel engine. This particular <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter,</b> collected at high temperatures in cordierite diesel particulate filters (DPF), which are optimized for removing diesel particles from diesel engine exhaust emissions, appeared extremely refractory to extractions using the classical extracting conditions for these pollutants. In particular, the method of accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) is described in detail here. Optimization was performed through experimental design to understand the impact of each factor studied and the factors’ possible interactions on the recovery yields. The conventional extraction technique, i. e., Soxhlet extraction, was also carried out, {{but the lack of}} quantitative extractions led us to use a more effective approach: hot Soxhlet. It appeared that the extraction of the heaviest PAHs and nitroPAHs by either the optimized ASE or hot Soxhlet processes was far from complete. To enhance recovery yields, we tested original solvent mixtures of aromatic and heteroaromatic solvents. Thereafter, these two extraction techniques were compared to microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE). In every case, the only solvent mixture that permitted quantitative extraction of the heaviest PAHs from the diesel soot was composed of pyridine and diethylamine, which has a strong electron-donor character. Conversely, the extraction of the nitrated PAHs was significantly improved by the use of an electron-acceptor solvent or by introducing a small amount of acetic acid into the pyridine. It was demonstrated that, for many desirable features, no single extraction technique stound out as the best: ASE, MAE or SFE could all challenge hot Soxhlet for favourable extractions. Consequently, the four optimized extraction techniques were performed to extract the naturally polluted diesel soot collected inside the DPF. Comparisons with the NIST standard reference material SRM 1650 b showed that the soot collected from the DPF contained 50 % fewer n-alkanes, and also markedly lower levels of PAHs (44 less concentrated) than SRM 1650 b, and that the ratio of nitroPAHs to PAHs was increased. These results were attributed to the high temperatures reached inside the particulate filter during sampling runs and to the contribution of the catalytic DPF to aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons abatement...|$|E
40|$|Background: Epidemiological {{studies suggest}} that {{inhalation}} of <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> from increases susceptibility to bacterial pneumonia. In vitro studies report that phagocytosis of carbon black by alveolar macrophages (AM) impairs killing of Streptococcus pneumoniae. We therefore aimed to use a mouse model {{to test the hypothesis}} that high levels of carbon loading of AM in vivo increases susceptibility to pneumococcal pneumonia. We also want to develop an air-tissue interface model to assess DNA damage to airway macrophages due to inhalation of manufactured nanoparticals. Methods: Female outbred mice were treated with either intranasal phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or ultrafine carbon black (UF-CB in PBS; 500 μg on day 1 and day 4), and then infected with S. pneumoniae strain D 39 on day 5. Survival was assessed over 72 h. The effect of UF-CB on AM carbon loading, airway inflammation, and a urinary marker of pulmonary oxidative stress was assessed in uninfected animals. The human monocyte cell line Mono Mac 6 and primary alveolar macrophages were used to assess DNA damage. To measure DNA damage in macrophages, we used the alkaline Comet assay. After nanoparticle exposure, a total of 100 macrophages were analysed per sample, as n= 50 duplicate slides. Tail length, percentage of DNA in the tail of the comet (% tail DNA), tail extent moment and olive tail moment, were calculated for each cell using the Komet Analysis software. Results: Instillation of UF-CB in mice resulted high levels of carbon loading in alveolar macrophages. In uninfected animals, UF-CB treated animals had increased urinary 8 -oxodG (P = 0. 055), and an increased airway neutrophil differential count (P < 0. 01). All PBS-treated mice died within 72 h after infection with S. pneumoniae, whereas morbidity and mortality after infection was reduced in UF-CB treated animals (median survival 48 h vs. 30 h, P < 0. 001). At 24 hr post-infection, UF-CB treated mice had lower lung and the blood S. pneumoniae colony forming unit counts, and lower airway levels of keratinocyte-derived chemokine/growth-related oncogene (KC/GRO), interferon gamma(IFN-γ) and other inflammatory cytokines. No increase in DNA damage was observed when cells were placed in the nitrogen gas flow for 10 mins compared with cells placed in air (insert control vs air control). Exposure to nanoparticles from all three metals for 10 min caused a significant increase in DNA damage in human Mono Mac 6 cells compared to insert control. There {{was no significant difference between}} DNA damage caused by gold (Au), silver (Ag) and Iron (Fe) nanoparticles. Conclusion: Acute high level loading of AM with ultrafine carbon black particles per se does not increase the susceptibility of mice to pneumococcal infection in vivo. We found significant DNA damage in macrophages cultured for 24 h with doses of up to 10 mg/cm² aerosolized iron, gold or silver nanoparticles.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} historical {{exposure levels}} at a coke plant for all agents {{considered to be}} of importance for epidemiological studies of mortality and cancer incidence. METHODS: Time weighted average exposure (8 h TWA) was estimated based on personal measurements for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>particulates.</b> Exposure to quartz was estimated relative to the concentration of <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>particulates.</b> These estimates were adjusted {{for the use of}} airstream helmets. Exposure to other agents were estimated qualitatively (asbestos, benzene, and arsenic) or semi-quantitatively (carbon monoxide (CO) and heat) based on measurements and other indicators of exposure. RESULTS: Exposure to PAHs was highest for those who worked {{at the top of the}} ovens (300 micrograms/m 3) in the period from 1970 - 6. The estimated PAH exposure was reduced to an average of 65 micrograms/m 3 after the introduction of exposure control measures in 1976. The estimates for <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>particulates</b> ranged from 1 to 16 mg/m 3, with the highest exposure for workers at the top of the ovens and at the coke screening station. CONCLUSIONS: The exposure of greatest concern in this study is to PAHs, but exposures to <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>particulates</b> and CO may also be of importance. The major limitations of this study are the lack of personal measurements before 1975 and the total lack of measurements for some of the exposed categories of workers. Despite these limitations, we think that this assessment reflects the actual exposures for most of the former employees. The assessment thus provides a reasonable tool for the subsequent epidemiological study and for future epidemiological follow up studies at the coke plant...|$|R
