40|$|An {{abstract}} of no {{more than}} 200 words The blending of coals as practiced for stamp charged coke making is determined primarily by technical factors and secondary by economic factors. The most common problem in stamp charged coal blending is whether to adjust an operational blend, a common need is to predict the effect on oven health. In stamp charged <b>coke</b> making, <b>push</b> force is a bottleneck for smooth operation of coke oven battery to produce superior quality of coke. In the present study, the relation between dilation characteristics of the coal blends has been investigated by the Audibert-Arnu Dilatometry test. The behavior of different coal blends has been studied {{to determine the effects of}} dilation of coal blend on <b>coke</b> CSR and <b>push</b> force. <b>Coke</b> plant data have been used for assessing the impact of dilation of coal blend on coke CSR and oven health. Results showed that dilation of coals blend is important parameters for controlling the <b>coke</b> quality and <b>push</b> force. The influence of some other important parameter on coke quality was also made in this study...|$|R
50|$|The Commons {{agreed on}} 1 May that Floyd should {{pay a fine}} of £1,000, stand in the pillory in three {{different}} places for two hours each time, and be carried {{from place to place}} on a horse without a saddle, with his face towards the horse's tail, and holding the tail in his hand. The king, however, objected to the Commons taking up the matter. The next morning he sent to inquire upon what precedents the Commons grounded their claim to act as a judicial body in regard to offences which did not concern their privileges. He also pointed out that they had failed to get his approval, and had not granted Floyd due process. Sandys by now had thought better of the course of direct judgement on Floyd; he argued that as the Speaker had signed nothing, the decision of the Commons was not yet effective. The momentum of the House was against him. Sir Edward <b>Coke</b> <b>pushed</b> for action, invoking his favoured view of the Commons as court of record. William Noy warned against passing judgement on overseas matters.|$|R

5000|$|The {{prepared}} coal {{charge in the}} coal tower is drawn by a charging car {{on the top of}} the batteries and charged into the ovens as per sequence. The charged coal is gradually heated by the heating wall of the oven in the absence of air to attain a temperature of 1000°-1050 °C at the central axis of the coke mass toward the end of coking period. the coking period is generally specified between 16 hrs and 19 hrs depending on oven condition and production requirement. the volatile matter of coal liberated during carbonization is collected in gas collecting mains in the form of raw coke oven gas passing through stand pipes and direct contact cooling with ammonia liquor spray. The gas cooled from 800 °C is drawn to coal chemical plant by exhauster. The residual <b>coke</b> is <b>pushed</b> out of the oven by pusher car through a guide into coke bucket. The red hot coke is taken to coke dry cooling plant for cooling.There are 4 batteries, each having 67 ovens each. Each oven can hold 32 tons of dry coal charge. The volumetric capacity of each oven is 41.6 cum the heat for carbonation is supplied by under firing of coke oven gas having CV of 4200 Kcal/Nm3 of mixture of BF gas & CO gas having 900 Kcal/Nm3. The heating system of batteries is of under jet, compound type having twin-heating flues with re-circulation of waste gases.its ...|$|R
30|$|Coke is {{produced}} by heating finely crushed coal charge in air tight coke ovens. The coal charge mostly consists of blends of different coking coals {{and in some cases}} also partially briquetted charge coal. After carbonization, the <b>coke</b> is <b>pushed</b> from the ovens and quenched with water/inert gas (dry quenching). This hard and porous carbonaceous product acts mainly as a source of reductant for the reduction of iron ore, provides thermal energy and provides a permeable support for the burden materials in the blast furnace. Although coke is expensive, it is still indispensable for the production of liquid iron through Blast Furnace (BF) route. The Major functions of coke in BF are to provide heat for different endothermic reactions inside the BF and for melting of slag and metal, reducing gases required for the reduction of iron oxides, support and permeable bed during counter current flow of materials and gases in BF. Coke is the only solid material in the furnace that supports the iron bearing burden and provides a permeable bed necessary for slag and metal to pass down into the hearth and for hot gases to pass upwards in BF. Of the above mentioned three roles of BF coke, the first two can be substituted by oil, gas, plastics and non-coking coals. These are injected through tuyeres to generate heat and reducing gases. Such a substitution brings reduction in coke rates for the blast furnace (coke rate is the weight of coke required to produce one tonne of hot metal). However, there is no other satisfactory material available, which can replace, fully or partially, metallurgical coke as a permeable support of blast furnace charge materials (burden). Over the last few decades, coke quality requirements have become more stringent due to development of large capacity blast furnaces (>[*] 3500  m 3) and high pulverized coal injection (PCI)/coal dust injection (CDI) rates.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Metallurgical coke for blast furnace and foundry use, and for some domestic boiler cokes are produced by carbonising coals in slot-type ovens. The coal is heated by heat transferred from the hot oven walls (usually 1250 °C) so that a temperature gradient is set up within the oven charge. A layer of plastic coal is formed (350 - 500 °C) which moves progressively towards the oven centre as carbonisation proceeds. Immediately after re-solidification, and again near 700 °C, the semi-coke suffers shrinkage as the carbon structure reorganises The post re-solidification shrinkage is the more severe and results in large, horizontal and vertical primary fissures being formed which allow breakage of the charge into lumps as it is pushed from the oven. A large central fissure, formed when the two plastic layers meet, divides the charge into two. Further breakage occurs at primary fissures on handling the <b>coke</b> after <b>pushing.</b> Smaller secondary fissures present in the resultant coke lump {{are believed to be}} a result of the shrinkage near 700 °C. Coke has three roles in the blast furnace: as a source of heat, a source of reducing agents and as a support for the burden. The latter function is particularly important {{at the bottom of the}} stack when coke is the only solid material present. The blast furnace output is dependent on the quantity of air that can be pushed up the stack. This depends on the permeability of the coke bed in the lower reaches of the stack. To maintain permeability, the coke should not suffer size degradation as it progresses down the stack; a mixture of large and small coke particles is disastrous. Thus coke quality tends to be assessed in terms of resistance to size degradation in a drum test. Size degradation occurs as a result of volumetric breakage at fissures and abrasion of surfaces. Brittle fracture theory suggests that volumetric breakage should occur as a result of the propagation of secondary fissures in coke lumps [...] ...|$|R
