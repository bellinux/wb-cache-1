The effect of specimen geometry, i. e. thickness, length of the shell and its apical angle, on the energy-absorbing capability are being studied both experimentally and analytically.

40|$|A {{methodology}} using {{sensitivity analysis}} is proposed {{to measure the}} effective permeability which includes {{the interaction of the}} resin and the reinforcement. Initially, mold-filling experiments were performed at isothermal conditions on the test specimen and the positions of the flow front were tracked with time using a flow visualization method. Following this, mold-filling experiments were simulated using a commercial software to obtain the positions of the flow front with time at the process conditions used for experiments. Several iterations were performed using different trial values of the permeability until the experimentally tracked and simulated positions of the flow front with time were matched. Finally, the value of the permeability thus obtained was validated by comparing the positions obtained by performing the experiments at different process conditions with the positions obtained by simulating the experiments. In this study, woven roving and <b>chopped</b> <b>strand</b> <b>mats</b> of E-class glass fiber and unsaturated polyester resin were used for the experiments.

40|$|Bio-composites are {{increasing}} in demand due to governmental incentives {{across the globe}} for both environmental and human health reasons. The ideal bio-composite is renewable, recyclable, available, and non-toxic. To properly engineer bio-composite products, the physical properties of the fiber as well as fiber/matrix interactions must be known. The problem {{lies in the fact}} that many suitable natural fibers are not currently available in a material form that may be easily worked with. This research investigates methods to process raw kenaf (hibiscus cannabinus) on a scale that allows researchers to make more consistent samples for testing. Though kenaf is highlighted, these processing methods may be applied to any natural fiber. The raw fibers are processed into kenaf <b>chopped</b> <b>strand</b> <b>mats</b> (KCSM) by adapting basic paper-making techniques. KCSM exhibit paper-like qualities and mechanical properties and provide a material of uniform thickness for use in composite parts. Also presented are a basic understanding of natural fiber constituents and effects of mechanical and co-mechanical treatments on those constituents. To test KCSM, samples are made for the ASTM D 3039 tensile testing and for testing in a dynamic material analyzer (DMA). Both mechanically and chemo-mechanically processed samples are made for the purpose of comparison. Also, I-beam bridges are built with KCSM to demonstrate how KCSM may be used to create a structure. This is spurred on by the annual SAMPE bridge competition that includes special categories for natural fiber beams. The lay-up procedure is shown in detail to provide a framework that future competitors may use to build quality I-beams for this competition. The properties obtained by using the KCSM are competitive with other reported properties for kenaf-based composites. A kenaf I-beam demonstrates a strength-to-weight ratio that is 65 % of a berglass I-beam built to the same dimensions. Trade-os of using KCSM are the random 2 d-fiber orientation and brittle failure, which are not usually desirable in composite components. The chemically treated samples indicate a higher degree of crystallinity but demonstrate inferior mechanical properties when compared to the untreated samples...|$|R
50|$|These rovings {{are then}} either used {{directly}} in a composite application such as pultrusion, filament winding (pipe), gun roving (where an automated gun chops the glass into short lengths and drops {{it into a}} jet of resin, projected {{onto the surface of}} a mold), or in an intermediary step, to manufacture fabrics such as <b>chopped</b> <b>strand</b> <b>mat</b> (CSM) (made of randomly oriented small cut lengths of fiber all bonded together), woven fabrics, knit fabrics or uni-directional fabrics.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, {{by laying}} {{multiple}} layers of fiber {{on top of one}} another, with each layer oriented in various preferred directions, the material's overall stiffness and strength can be efficiently controlled. In fiberglass, it is the plastic matrix which permanently constrains the structural glass fibers to directions chosen by the designer. With <b>chopped</b> <b>strand</b> <b>mat,</b> this directionality is essentially an entire two dimensional plane; with woven fabrics or unidirectional layers, directionality of stiffness and strength can be more precisely controlled within the plane.|$|E
5000|$|Fiberglass (or fibreglass; [...] "Fiberglas" [...] is a trademarked brand name) {{is a type}} of fiber-reinforced plastic {{where the}} {{reinforcement}} fiber is specifically glass fiber. The glass fiber may be randomly arranged, flattened into a sheet (called a <b>chopped</b> <b>strand</b> <b>mat),</b> or woven into a fabric. The plastic matrix may be a thermoset polymer matrix - most often based on thermosetting polymers such as epoxy, polyester resin, or vinylester - or a thermoplastic.

40|$|Deterioration of {{concrete}} structures due to penetration of aggressive species through the cover layer causing corrosion of the reinforcing steel {{is a major}} problem leading to premature failure {{of concrete}} structures throughout the world. Samples have been made using <b>chopped</b> <b>strand</b> alkali-resistant glass <b>mat</b> as a shutter lining material and tests have been carried out to determine the effect of the glass on the potential durability of structures. The effect of the glass on fragmentation and flexural stiffness and strength has also been investigated. The results indicate that this material promotes the formation of better concrete in the cover layer as well as inhibiting cracking. It therefore offers considerable potential for the construction of durable structures. It is also indicated that the glass improves flexural stiffness and inhibits fragmentation...|$|R
40|$|Equipment and {{components}} {{made of plastics}} and composites are widely used in highly corrosive environments in the processing industry. Examples are the storage tanks, pumps and pipes for chemical transport and stacks in combustion plants. The demand for reliable nondestructive testing of plastic process equipment has increased significantly in recent years. Glass fiber reinforced plastics (GRP) is a common construction material for process equipment in the chemical industry. It can be used both as structural bearing in a dual laminate with a thermoplastic material as a corrosion barrier or as a solid GRP. In the latter case, the laminate is generally built up with a resin rich corrosion barrier (about 2. 5 to 5 mm thick) with a low content of glass closest to the chemical. The glass fiber in this layer is usually a surface veil and <b>chopped</b> <b>strand</b> <b>mats</b> (CSM), i. e. it has no general fiber orientation. Outside this is the structural bearing layer with much higher glass content, usually wound fiber and / or woven fiber mats with a preferential fiber direction. The corrosion barrier is not load bearing and corrosion of this layer can be allowed. However, no corrosion can be permitted in the structural support layer. Because of this {{it is important to}} measure the thickness of the corrosion barrier for quality control but also to determine how far an attack has reached in the corrosion barrier. Today there is no non-destructive testing method that can answer this. Instead destructive sampling (often a drill core) must be made. This is difficult, expensive and sometimes impossible. There is thus a great interest in a method that, preferably at any time during operation, can provide answers to these questions. Due to the heterogeneity of the GRP material in terms of amount, type and direction of the fibers, conventional algorithm for ultrasound imaging will not work. One aim of our work is thus to develop new signal processing methods to handle this heterogeneity. In addition we are also looking at the possibility to use optical fibers and Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors for corrosion monitoring of GRP structure...|$|R
50|$|Commercial {{fiberglass}} hulls are molded, {{and since}} the fiberglass and resin used have no inherent shapes, the mold can be of just about any shape. The fibre glass is fired into the mold with a gun, normally using <b>chop</b> <b>mat</b> <b>strands</b> in epoxy. It is important to control the atmosphere to keep humidity low during this operation otherwise moisture may be trapped in the fibreglass that will eventually blister and cause fibreglass pox. Molds for low production power boats are often made of plywood, and so {{the properties of the}} plywood often result in a chined hull. Hard chines may be rounded off by the addition of filler to the mold to create a fillet; this creates the soft chines often found on fiberglass boats.The outside of a mold is supported by a steel lattice work to ensure rigidity.|$|R
50|$|Storage tanks {{can be made}} of {{fiberglass}} with capacities up {{to about}} 300 tonnes. Smaller tanks {{can be made with}} <b>chopped</b> <b>strand</b> <b>mat</b> cast over a thermoplastic inner tank which acts as a preform during construction. Much more reliable tanks are made using woven mat or filament wound fiber, with the fiber orientation at right angles to the hoop stress imposed in the side wall by the contents. Such tanks tend to be used for chemical storage because the plastic liner (often polypropylene) is resistant {{to a wide range of}} corrosive chemicals. Fiberglass is also used for septic tanks.|$|E

The deck is half-inch plywood sheathed in GRP; the bulkheads are also plywood, tabbed to the hull with fibreglass cloth. The ballast is 7000 lb, either lead and iron (earlier boats) or all lead, installed inside the keel (which {{is part of the}} hull shape) and set in resin.|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation to study friction and interface temperature characteristics of <b>chopped</b> <b>strand</b> <b>mat</b> fiberglass (type-R) reinforced polyester (CGRP) sliding against smooth stainless steel. Pin-on-disk (POD) apparatus {{is used to}} perform the experimental tests under dry sliding condition at room temperature. Several parameters are considered, namely load (30, 60 & 90 N), sliding velocity (2. 8, 3. 52 & 3. 9 m/s) and sliding distance (0 - 2. 51 km). Three different orientations of <b>chopped</b> <b>strand</b> <b>mat</b> with respect to sliding direction, Parallel (P), Anti-parallel (AP) and Normal orientations (N) are investigated. Continuous measurements of friction forces using strain gauges, and interface temperatures using infrared thermometer are performed. In addition, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used to study the worn surface to verify the results. Experimental results show that specimen’s orientations and the tested parameters {{play a major role}} in controlling friction and interface temperature characteristics of the CGRP/stainless steel. Maximum friction coefficient was taken place in AP orientation at 3. 5 m/s and 2. 5 km, which was about 0. 6.
