25|$|RIT Public Safety is {{the primary}} agency {{responsible}} for protection of students, staff and property as well as enforcement of both college policies and state laws. Officers are NYS Licensed Security Guards who possess an expanded scope of authority under NYS Education Law, and many Officers have prior law enforcement backgrounds. Rumor has also circulated that the department is pushing for Peace Officer authority, however no official action has been made at this time. Public Safety Officers operate both a dispatch center and various types of patrol units on campus and at off campus holdings (such as The Inn and Conference Center) and also manage the <b>Call</b> <b>Box</b> System. Activating a <b>call</b> <b>box</b> will automatically place the user in touch with an Officer in the dispatch center who will direct Patrol Officers {{to respond to the}} location; if necessary, Officers will summon the Monroe County Sheriff's to respond as well. As the college does not have 24/7 on campus crisis intervention counselors, {{in the event of a}} mental or behavioral health incident during hours where a counselor is not available, Public Safety Officers are also trained to act as mediators until an on-call counselor can be summoned.|$|E
25|$|French police {{launched}} a massive manhunt for Sid Ahmed Rezala in December 1999 {{after the murder}} of British student Isabel Peake who was thrown from a train, and the subsequent killings of a 36-year-old French mother and a one-time girlfriend. Having fled to the Portuguese capital via Spain, Rezala made {{a phone call to}} his girlfriend from a public <b>call</b> <b>box</b> â€“ unaware that investigators in France had tapped her phone. On January 11, 2000, Rezala's hiding place was snuffed out by Portuguese police, who arrested the man in Barreiro, south of Lisbon. He had been staying in Almada with friends of a Spanish acquaintance and was planning to leave within 24 hours for Spain's Canary Islands.|$|E
500|$|Northern New Jersey {{experienced}} a heat wave in July 1937, with daytime temperatures of [...] and warm nights. The sustained heat contributed to nitrate decomposition {{in the film}} vaults, and the building's ventilation was inadequate to prevent a dangerous buildup of gasses. At some time shortly after [...] on the 9th, spontaneous ignition occurred in the vault at the building's northwest corner.

2500|$|The city evidently was prosperous {{enough at}} one point that when a system of call boxes was {{installed}} for the city fire and police departments, the city was able to special-order the insulators with markings unique to the city's system.

2500|$|The Communications Act, 2003, {{which came}} into force on 25 July 2003, {{introduced}} a new industry regulator, the Office of Communications (Ofcom), to replace the Office of Telecommunications (Oftel).

The licensing regime {{was replaced by a}} general authorisation for companies to provide telecommunications services subject to general conditions of entitlement and, in some instances, specific conditions. [...] Under a specific condition BT retained its universal service obligation (USO) for GB, excluding the Hull area. The USO included connecting consumers to the fixed telephone network, schemes for consumers with special social needs, and the provision of <b>call</b> <b>box</b> services.|$|E
2500|$|Within {{the fictional}} narrative, the Doctor is a Time Lord {{from the planet}} Gallifrey who travels through time and space in his {{dimensionally}} transcendental [...] "bigger on the inside" [...] time machine: the TARDIS (Time And Relative Dimension(s) In Space) which took the exterior form of a 1963 police telephone <b>call</b> <b>box,</b> and retains the appearance throughout the programme. His kind have dedicated themselves to overseeing all {{of time and space}} without interference. The Doctor chose to leave his home by stealing an obsolete TARDIS model as revealed in the 1969 serial The War Games and depicted in the 2013 episode [...] "The Name of the Doctor". With this vehicle, the Doctor explores the universe with usually human companions who serve as audience surrogate characters to ask questions which allow the Doctor to provide relevant exposition.|$|E

2500|$|The Anacostia {{station has}} been used several times for {{experiments}} in improving Metrorail's operations. In July 1997, Anacostia was one of five Metrorail stations used to test a premium monthly parking fee which would guarantee the purchaser a spot at the station's parking garage. The $50-a-month pass {{was the most popular}} at Anacostia, and the pricing scheme was expanded throughout the Metro system in March 1998. Although Metro reserved on 15 percent of all spaces for such parking at most stations, at Anacostia this was raised to 25 percent. In March 1999, Metro tested a new emergency <b>call</b> <b>box</b> system at Anacostia and two other Metrorail stations. When Metro established a carsharing program with Flexcar in 2001, the Anacostia station was one of 12 Metrorail stations at which the system was tested. Metro also tested its [...] "Next Bus" [...] real-time information system (designed to let riders know how long they {{have to wait for the}} bus) at Anacostia and four other Metrorail stations. Technical problems and funding issues delayed implementation of the project on a wider scale. Metro relaunched the system in June 2009, and once more Metrobus [...] "Next Bus" [...] signs were activated at Anacostia and two other pilot Metrorail stations. When Metro announced a pilot program in the spring of 2006 to encourage food and other vendors to sell goods in Metrorail stations, Anacostia was one of 12 stations chosen for the test. The program stalled due to cleanliness, safety, and other concerns, but was reinvigorated in 2009, and Anacostia was one of three Metrorail stations chosen again to experiment with the initiative. When Metro adopted the SmarTrip fare care program the same year, Anacostia was one of three stations chosen to experiment with SmarTrip fare gate express lanes. The express lane program was canceled when too few riders used the express lanes. Anacostia was also one of six parking garages and lots where Metro experimented with accepting credit card payments rather than SmarTrip cards in 2007. Anacostia was also one of eight Metro stations which first sold SmarTrip cards in 2008.|$|E

50|$|The 55 mi {{stretch of}} I-91 in Massachusetts {{was the last}} section that {{featured}} motorist-aid <b>call</b> <b>boxes.</b> The <b>call</b> <b>boxes</b> were important as {{a good part of}} I-91 in Massachusetts is rural, unlike many other freeways in the state. The <b>call</b> <b>boxes</b> were eventually removed in 2012.
