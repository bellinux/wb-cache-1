5|$|EdwardI died in 1307, and his {{successor}} EdwardII was distracted from war with Scotland by internal quarrels, enabling the Scottish to roam further south through England. In 1310 or 1311, Robert <b>Clifford</b> was given Skipton Castle; it was farther from the border than Brougham {{and at a time}} when Scottish raids were ravaging Westmorland, <b>Clifford</b> chose to spend more time and effort building at Skipton. <b>Clifford</b> was killed at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, which ended the English counter-offensive into Scotland. At the time of Robert's death, his son Roger de <b>Clifford,</b> 2nd Baron de <b>Clifford,</b> was only 14 and not old enough to inherit. Therefore, the <b>Clifford</b> estates experienced another period of control through guardians, suffering from Scottish raids to such an extent that in 1317 the king granted Roger £200 towards the maintenance of his castles. Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere was responsible for the upkeep of Brougham Castle and some other <b>Clifford</b> properties including Appleby Castle. Between 1316 and 1318 he spent £363 on the garrisons at Brougham and Appleby, though was supported by the king who gave £1,270 towards their upkeep. Funds to pay the garrison were not easily gathered from the <b>Clifford</b> estates, and they were accused of poaching and pillaging. In 1320, Roger <b>Clifford</b> was given his inheritance but probably spent more time at Skipton. He was executed as a traitor in 1322 after his capture at the Battle of Boroughbridge. Brougham Castle was amongst the <b>Clifford</b> lands confiscated and given to Andrew de Harcla for supporting the king against the uprising. However, by 1323 Harcla too had been executed for treason and the castle came into the possession of EdwardII. In May 1323, a truce was signed between the Scots and English resulting in a reduction in garrison strength throughout northern England.|$|E
5|$|When George <b>Clifford</b> died in 1605, {{his wife}} Margaret became dowager countess and began {{repairing}} Brougham Castle, which became her favoured residence. Margaret contended with {{claims to the}} ownership of the family estates from her brother-in-law Francis <b>Clifford,</b> 4th Earl of Cumberland, but held onto Brougham Castle. Her daughter, Lady Anne <b>Clifford</b> continued {{the restoration of the}} castle and other <b>Clifford</b> properties. The only one of Margaret's three children to survive childhood, Anne inherited the <b>Clifford</b> estates after her mother died in 1616. The inheritance was not without incident. The Earl of Cumberland again asserted his claim to the <b>Clifford</b> estates, however the privy council found in favour of Anne. The solution was only temporary, and in April 1617 the king decided that the Earl of Cumberland was the rightful heir, and the <b>Clifford</b> estates passed to Francis <b>Clifford.</b> Later the same year, JamesI visited Scotland and on his return journey he stayed at the castles of Carlisle, Brougham, and Appleby, where expensive banquets were given in his honour. It is estimated that the festivities cost around £1,200. After this, Brougham was almost forgotten by its owner and neglected.|$|E

5|$|Clifford's {{career was}} {{transformed}} when, on 22 May 1455, {{his father was}} killed fighting Richard, Duke of York and York's Neville allies, the earls of Salisbury and Warwick at the first Battle of St Albans. John <b>Clifford</b> was still under age at the time, and {{was not able to}} prove his age in order to obtain livery of his lands until 16 June 1456. He entered into his inheritance less than a month later, and was appointed a Justice of the peace in Westmorland. <b>Clifford</b> inherited the barony of <b>Clifford,</b> the family seat at Skipton Castle and the hereditary office of High Sheriff of Westmorland. He was summoned to Parliament on 30 July 1460.|$|E
5|$|In June 1460 {{the exiled}} Yorkists {{successfully}} invaded England, and on 10 July they defeated a royal army at the Battle of Northampton, and captured the king. As a result, <b>Clifford</b> was now ordered to surrender Penrith castle and Honour {{back to the}} earl of Salisbury. But although the now-Yorkist government repeatedly sent messages, orders and instructions to <b>Clifford</b> in the north, he did not acknowledge them, and with Northumberland and Lord Roos, remained in control {{of most of the}} region. In October 1460, the duke of York claimed the throne, and a parliament was summoned to discuss this. The result of its deliberations was the Act of Accord, which disinherited the Prince of Wales in favour of York and his heirs. This, it has been said, was 'repugnant' to <b>Clifford</b> and his colleagues and strengthened their support for the queen. It seems that, although <b>Clifford</b> was summoned to attend, he stayed away, and probably met with Queen Margaret in Kingston upon Hull, where she was gathering Lancastrian lords and their retainers to her. Together, they had soon gathered a fighting force of thousands. <b>Clifford</b> was one of these lords who was subsequently accused of 'systematically' pillaging and looting the Yorkshire estates and tenants of York and Salisbury. In response to these attacks, York, Salisbury, and the latter's son Thomas led an army to the north. Encamped at York's castle at Sandal, on 30 December 1460, the two armies met at the Battle of Wakefield, where <b>Clifford</b> commanded one of the wings of the Lancastrian army. The Yorkist army was routed, and all three Yorkist lords were killed. <b>Clifford</b> was knighted by the Lancastrian commander, Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset prior to the battle commencing.|$|E

5|$|John <b>Clifford,</b> 9th Baron <b>Clifford,</b> 9th Lord of Skipton (8 April 1435 – 28 March 1461), was a Lancastrian {{military}} leader during the Wars of the Roses. The <b>Clifford</b> family {{was one of}} the most prominent families among the northern English nobility of the fifteenth century; and by the marriages of his sisters John <b>Clifford</b> had links to some very important families of the time, including the earls of Devon. He was orphaned at about twenty years of age when his father was slain at the first battle of the Wars of the Roses, the Battle of St Albans in 1455. It was probably as a result of his father's death there that <b>Clifford</b> became one of the strongest supporters of Queen Margaret of Anjou, consort of King Henry VI, who ended up as effective leader of the Lancastrian faction.|$|E

5|$|Roger <b>Clifford</b> died at Skipton Castle in 1389, and the <b>Clifford</b> family {{began to}} lose {{interest}} in Westmorland. The Cliffords preferred their properties in Yorkshire to their dilapidated castles in Westmorland, which had been ravaged by wars with Scotland. Brougham Castle is not {{known to have been}} in use as a residence again until 1421, when a man was accused of forging coins in the castle. Although little is known about Brougham during this period, historians believe it likely that repairs were undertaken, and a rivalry emerged between the <b>Clifford</b> family and the House of Neville that would later have consequences for Brougham. The familial enmity meant that the Earl of Salisbury, a Neville, used his position as lord of Penrith to antagonise the Cliffords; it is likely that Brougham Castle was kept garrisoned due to its proximity to Penrith. In the Wars of the Roses (1455–1485), the two families were on opposing sides, the Cliffords supporting the House of Lancaster and the Nevilles supporting the House of York. When the Yorkist EdwardIV took the throne in 1461 the lands of John <b>Clifford,</b> 9th Baron de <b>Clifford</b> were confiscated. In 1471, EdwardIV granted Sir William Parr Brougham Castle and other properties which had belonged to the Cliffords. A year later Henry <b>Clifford,</b> John's son and heir, was pardoned and when the Lancastrian Henry Tudor took the throne as HenryVII, Henry <b>Clifford</b> appealed for the return of the <b>Clifford</b> estates.

5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Wars of Scottish Independence, in 1296, Brougham became an important military base for Robert <b>Clifford,</b> 1st Baron de <b>Clifford.</b> He began refortifying the castle: the wooden outer defences were replaced with stronger, more impressive stone walls, and a large stone gatehouse was added. The importance of Brougham and Robert <b>Clifford</b> was such that, in 1300, he hosted King Edward I of England at the castle. Robert's son, Roger <b>Clifford,</b> was executed as a traitor, in 1322, and the family estates passed into the possession of King Edward II of England, although they were returned once his son Edward III became king. The region was often at risk from the Scots, and in 1388, the castle was captured and sacked.|$|E
