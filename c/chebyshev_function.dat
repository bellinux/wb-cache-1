40|$|Modelling of {{ultrasonic}} {{bulk wave}} scattering by an internal, infinitely long, axial crack in a thick-walled pipe is considered. The problem is formulated as a hypersingular integral equation for the crack-opening displacement (COD), the hypersingularity arises in the Green’s tensor. The COD is expanded in <b>Chebyshev</b> <b>functions</b> {{which have the}} correct square-root singularity along the crack edges, thereby regularizing the integral equation. To discretize the integral equation it is likewise projected onto the same <b>Chebyshev</b> <b>functions.</b> A model of an ultrasonic rectangular vertically polarized shear wave contact probe is developed, and the signal response is calculated using a reciprocity argument. Some numerical examples demonstrate the possible application of the method, in particular investigating {{the importance of the}} pipe curvature...|$|R

Like most proofs of the PNT, it starts out by reformulating the problem {{in terms of a}} less intuitive, but better-behaved, prime-counting function. The idea is to count the primes (or a related set such as the set of prime powers) with weights to arrive at a function with smoother asymptotic behavior.
