Our econometric methodology follows the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator applied to dynamic models of panel data. The results show that property crimes are significantly deterred by higher clear-up rates. Also for property crime rates, {{the results indicate that}} unemployment increases crime. For violent crimes, however, the effect of the <b>clear-up</b> <b>rate</b> and unemployment are found to be insignificant. crime, deterrence, unemployment, panel data, GMM...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study, having as {{theoretical}} reference the economic model of crime (Becker, 1968; Ehrlich, 1973), {{which are the}} socioeconomic and demographic determinants of crime in Spain paying attention {{on the role of}} provincial peculiarities. We estimate a crime equation using a panel dataset of Spanish provinces (NUTS 3) for the period 1993 to 1999 employing the GMM-system estimator. Empirical results suggest that lagged crime rate and <b>clear-up</b> <b>rate</b> are correlated to all typologies of crime rate considered. Property crimes are better explained by socioeconomic variables (GDP per capita, GDP growth rate and percentage of population with high school and university degree), while demographic factors reveal important and significant influences, in particular for crimes against the person. These results are obtained using an instrumental variable approach that takes advantage of the dynamic properties of our dataset to control for both measurement errors in crime data and joint endogeneity of the explanatory variables. demographics, socioeconomic factors, panel data, crime...|$|E

Serious crimes (liable to imprisonment) have a higher <b>clear-up</b> <b>rate</b> than petty crimes, and are thus probably less biased by police differential selection, one of the reasons invoked to explain minorities over-representation. The majority of juveniles in our database live in urban areas and, according to our estimations based on the parents ’ socioeconomic status, they are also a majority to live in households below the poverty threshold. Restricting to this subpopulation, we do not find any evidence of over-representation: the proportion of juvenile offenders belonging to minorities is of the same order of magnitude as their share in the overall urban juvenile population living below the poverty threshold...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} analyses on {{the spatial}} and temporal distribution of residential burglaries in Christchurch for the five-year period 1998 / 1999 to 2002 / 2003. The specific aspects of residential burglary that are explored are the geography of burglary and <b>clear-up</b> <b>rates,</b> the characteristics of burglars, the distance they travel and {{the characteristics of the}} burgled properties. It was important to research these aspects of residential burglaries in Christchurch as there has previously been minimal research conducted into burglaries in Christchurch. The research that has been conducted is almost ten years old and did not comprehensively cover all aspects of burglaries. This thesis provides up to date analysis of the current burglary problem in Christchurch. The residential burglary data was provided by the Christchurch Branch of the New Zealand Police Department. This data included the addresses of both burglary victims and offenders and demographic characteristics of offenders. Information regarding the burglary event such as the items stolen and the time and date that the burglary occurred, was also supplied. This data allowed for analysis into many aspects of burglaries. In order to substantiate the conclusions formed there is comparison with the results of international and national studies into burglaries. The key findings of this research were that Christchurch residential burglary rates decreased and were positively related to deprivation. The greatest percent of burglaries occurred during traditional work times, during the traditional workweek. Conversely, the <b>clear-up</b> <b>rates</b> increased and were inversely related to deprivation. The majority of offenders were unemployed European males, aged between 15 and 19 years of age. Generally, offenders travelled short distances to burgle, and the distance was found to be negatively correlated with the level of deprivation of the area in which the victim lived. There were also some interesting findings regarding the characteristics of the burgled and non-burgled properties and how they differed depending on whether the property was in a deprived or non-deprived area...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the effects on}} crime of a localized policing experiment that decriminalized cannabis possession in the London borough of Lambeth between 2001 and 2002. We find that decriminalization led to a surge in drug related offences, and a collapse in arrest and <b>clear-up</b> <b>rates</b> for drug related crimes in Lambeth. These effects are quantitatively large and persist well after the policy experiment ends. However, the policy does allow the Lambeth police to reallocate their effort towards non-drug related crimes, leading to permanent reductions in nearly all other crime types. We also find the policy to have spillovers onto boroughs neighboring Lambeth. As drug consumers and suppliers relocate to Lambeth after decriminalization, drug crime rates significantly fall in neighbors to Lambeth. To understand the benefits of coordinating drugs policies across jurisdictions, we compare these results to the effects on crime of the nationwide decriminalization of cannabis in the UK from 2004 to 2009. We find that nationwide decriminalization {{does not lead to}} a growth in drugs related crime, but does allow the police to reallocate effort towards non-drug related crime. We interpret the results through a Hotelling-style model that makes precise the behavioral response to decriminalization of the police, suppliers and demanders of drugs...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the impact on}} crime of a localized policing experiment that depenalized the possession of small quantities of cannabis in the London borough of Lambeth. Such a policy can: (i) impact the demand for cannabis in Lambeth as users move there to purchase cannabis; (ii) enable the Lambeth police to reallocate e¤ort towards other types of crime. We investigate whether the depenalization policy impacts the level and composition of crime, using administrative records on criminal o¤ences by drug type, and for seven types of nondrug crime. We …nd that depenalization in Lambeth led to signi…cant increases in cannabis possession o¤ences that persisted well after the policy experiment ended. We …nd evidence that the policy caused the police to reallocate e¤ort towards crimes related to the supply of Class-A drugs, as well as reallocating e¤ort towards non-drug crime: there are signi…cant reductions in …ve types of non-drug crime, and signi…cant improvements in police e¤ectiveness against such crimes as measured by arrest and <b>clear-up</b> <b>rates.</b> Despite the overall fall in crime attributable to the policy, we …nd the total welfare of local residents likely fell, as measured by house prices.

30|$|In sum, metacognitive {{information}} may support learners in identifying {{aspects of the}} learning material that need further attention. Additionally, they may foster grounding processes enabling learners to tail their conversation and learning process better {{to the needs of}} the individuals and thus should foster knowledge gain. Consequently, we assume that learners provided with metacognitive group awareness information in the form of confidence regarding specific assumptions gain more knowledge during collaboration than learners without this information (hypothesis 1) due to improved collaboration processes. However, we acknowledge the possibility that additional information might also put an extra strain on the learners’ cognitive system, already charged by the collaborative situation (Dillenbourg and Bétrancourt 2006). On the other hand, metacognitive confidence {{information may}} also directly affect learners’ confidence levels, since insecurities signaling an individual need for clarification can easily be identified and thus addressed during collaboration—leading to a higher <b>clear-up</b> <b>rate.</b> For example, Dehler et al. (2011) found that providing information on self-assessed levels of understanding led learners to tailor their communication to these aspects. Thus, we further hypothesize that learners receiving information on metacognitive confidence regarding specific assumptions gain more confidence during collaboration than learners without this information (hypothesis 2). In terms of interdependence, we expect enhanced knowledge exchange and conflict resolution processes to increase interdependence between learners within the same dyad.|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to explore}} three key {{determinants}} {{of crime in}} the Becker-Ehrlich model: labour market conditions, {{the criminal justice system}} and family background. We firstly apply dynamic panel data analysis to test the effect of the labour market conditions and criminal justice system on crime for the UK and US. We test the effect of deterrence and unemployment on burglary, theft and robbery. We adopt the methods used by Reilly and Witt (1996) and replicate them on new data for England and Wales. We improve on the previous analyses by introducing dynamics and estimating the model in the GMM framework. The results reveal that higher <b>clear-up</b> <b>rate</b> predicts lower levels of burglary, theft and robbery. Past crime rates positively predict current crime rates and unemployment rate effects are positive and significant in the system GMM specification. The second empirical chapter tests the impact of the labour market opportunities of those most likely to commit crime (unskilled males) on area arrest rates in the US utilising the GMM estimation. We have put together crime data from the Uniform Crime Reports and data on the labour market conditions from the Current Population Survey from 1964 to 2008. We find a positive and significant relationship between unemployment and property crime arrest rates. However, for weekly earnings, the only clear and significant effect is on the burglary arrest rates. In the third empirical chapter we set up a logistic model to test for the association of parents' criminal background with children's contact with the police. We use self-reported data from the Offending Crime and Justice Survey (2003 - 2006). We find that children whose parents/guardians have committed at least one crime have a 2. 5 times higher odds of committing an offence than children of non-criminal parents. The effect of a custodial sentence of the parents increases the odds of the children offending by 3. 5 times. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Crimes {{lower the}} quality of life for many people in all societies. The concept of crime prevention is directly related to the studies about causation and prevention methods. State statistics institutes and law enforcement agencies store various kinds and quantities of data. Law enforcement agencies can use these data to take some measures to eliminate and minimize the crime rates. Temporal and spatial variations in crime rates have been studied extensively in the literature. A variety of demographic factors including unemployment rate, education level, age composition of the population, and average income level have been suggested by different researchers as explanatory variables for observed variations in crime rates. Variables such as number of police per capita, crime <b>clear-up</b> <b>rates,</b> and incarceration population have been considered as deterrents of crime. In this thesis, using cross-sectional data associated with 81 cities in Turkey, selected types of crime (murder, theft, crimes against persons and property) are empirically analyzed. The multiple regression results indicate that crime rates in general are negatively related to clear up rates and average income level in a region seems to be positively related to crimes against property. For short term forecasting of crime rates, a trend and seasonality adjusted exponential smoothing scheme is applied to the time series data for theft rates in three major cities. The highest mean absolute percentage eiTor computed ba. sed on one-period-ahead forecast errors is less than 15...|$|R
40|$|Law {{enforcement}} agencies regularly collect crime scene information. There exists, however, no detailed, systematic procedure for this. The data collected {{is affected by}} the experience or current condition of law enforcement officers. Consequently, the data collected might differ vastly between crime scenes. This is especially problematic when investigating volume crimes. Law enforcement officers regularly do manual comparison on crimes based on the collected data. This is a time-consuming process; especially as the collected crime scene information might not always be comparable. The structuring of data and introduction of automatic comparison systems could benefit the investigation process. This thesis investigates descriptive and predictive models for automatic comparison of crime scene data with the purpose of aiding law enforcement investigations. The thesis first investigates predictive and descriptive methods, with a focus on data structuring, comparison, and evaluation of methods. The knowledge is then applied to the domain of crime scene analysis, with a focus on detecting serial residential burglaries. This thesis introduces a procedure for systematic collection of crime scene information. The thesis also investigates impact and relationship between crime scene characteristics and how to evaluate the descriptive model results. The results suggest that the use of descriptive and predictive models can provide feedback for crime scene analysis that allows a more effective use of law enforcement resources. Using descriptive models based on crime characteristics, including Modus Operandi, allows law enforcement agents to filter cases intelligently. Further, by estimating the link probability between cases, law enforcement agents can focus on cases with higher link likelihood. This would allow a more effective use of law enforcement resources, potentially allowing an increase in <b>clear-up</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R
