In the other case, which has been studied extensively since the early 1970s, patients often have permanent damage, although some recovery is possible, depending {{on the nature of}} the pathophysiology. Usually, some <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>learning</b> remains, although it may be very elementary.

25|$|All adaptations help organisms {{survive in}} their {{ecological}} niches. The adaptive traits may be structural, behavioral or physiological. Structural adaptations are physical features of an organism (shape, body covering, armament, internal organization). Behavioral adaptations are inherited behavior chains {{and the ability}} to learn. Behaviors may be inherited in detail (instincts), or a <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>learning</b> may be inherited (see neuropsychology). Examples: searching for food, mating, vocalizations. Physiological adaptations can permit the organism to perform special functions (for instance, making venom, secreting slime, phototropism), but may also involve more general functions such as growth and development, temperature regulation, ionic balance and other aspects of homeostasis. Adaptation affects all aspects of the life of an organism.|$|E

After the end of Great Sioux War in 1877, the Lakota people were impoverished, harassed and confined to a reservation. At the time, many people believed Native Americans were a vanishing race whose only hope for survival was rapid cultural transformation. The U.S. government urgently sought a progressive educational model to rapidly assimilate Indians into white culture. Whether this could be achieved and how rapidly it could be done was unknown. Pratt believed he could make use of the Carlisle facility. He thought its proximity to officials in Washington, D.C. would help him educate officials about the Indian <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>learning.</b>|$|E

40|$|Summary. This chapter {{introduces}} a rule-based {{perspective on the}} framework of fuzzy lattices, and the Fuzzy Lattice Reasoning (FLR) classifier. The notion of fuzzy lattice rules is introduced, and a training algorithm for inducing a fuzzy lattice rule engine from data is specified. The role of positive valuation functions for specifying fuzzy lattices is underlined and non-linear (sigmoid) positive valuation functions are proposed, that is an additional novelty of the chapter. The <b>capacities</b> <b>for</b> <b>learning</b> of the FLR classifier using both linear and sigmoid functions are demonstrated in a real-world application domain, that of air quality assessment. To tackle common problems related to ambient air quality, a machine learning approach is demon-strated in two applications.

The second concerns with the estimation of quartely ozone concentration levels, using a dataset from Valencia, Spain. 9. ...|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{predictability}} has {{for many}} years been posited {{to be a key}} variable in whether learning is expected to evolve in particular species, a claim revisited in two recent papers. However, amongst many researchers, especially neuroscientists, consensus is building for a very different view, namely that learning ability may be an emergent property of nervous systems and, thus, all animals with nervous systems should be able to learn. Here we explore these differing views, sample research on associative learning in insects, and review our own work demonstrating learning in larval antlions (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae), a highly unlikely insect candidate. We conclude by asserting that the <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> associative <b>learning</b> is the default condition favored by neuroscientists: Whenever selection pressures favor evolution of nervous systems, the <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> associative <b>learning</b> follows ipso facto. Nonetheless, to reconcile these disparate views, we suggest that (a) models for the evolution of learning may instead be models for conditions overriding behavioral plasticity; and, (b) costs of learning in insects may be, in fact, costs associated with more complex cognitive skills, skills that are just beginning to be discovered, rather than simple associative learning.
