40|$|Farmers must yearly {{allocate}} {{fields to}} different crops and choose crop management options. Far from being obvious, these decisions are critical because they modify farm productivity and profitability {{in the short}} and long run. To support farmers and efficiently allocate scarce resources, decision support models are developed. Decision support models are mainly based on two concepts, the <b>cropping</b> <b>plan</b> and the crop rotation decisions. These decisions concern crop choice, crop spatial distribution within the farmland and crop temporal successions over years. Decisions are {{at the core of}} the farm management. Decisions have strong impacts on resource use efficiency and on environmental processes at both farm and landscape scales. We review here more than 120 references where <b>cropping</b> <b>plan</b> and crop rotation decision concepts were incorporated into models. Our aim is to review how these two concepts have been formalised and used in agronomic, economic and land-use studies. We found that <b>cropping</b> <b>plan</b> decisions selection and design have been done using many approaches based on different objectives and handled at very different scales. The main results show that (1) <b>cropping</b> <b>plan</b> design decisions have mainly been tackled as a static concept, i. e. as if they were a single decision made only once a year or once a rotation; (2) modelling the achievement of a suitable <b>cropping</b> <b>plan</b> is often based on a single monetary criterion optimization procedure instead of a multi-criteria assessment; and (3) when considered, uncertainty of information is defined as stochastic factors or probability of occurrence, but this probability is kept static whatever the knowledge of the dynamic evolution of various constraints. We argue that <b>cropping</b> <b>plan</b> and crop rotation decisions are on the contrary dynamic processes incorporated into a succession of other planned and adaptive decisions made at annual and long-term horizons. For supporting farmers in their decisions, new <b>cropping</b> <b>plan</b> decision models will require new modelling paradigm.

Irrigation management includes optimal allocation {{of water for}} irrigation purposes, optimal cropping pattern for a given land area and water availabilities with an objective to maximize economic returns. In the present study we consider an optimization model based on linear programming for determining optimal <b>crop</b> <b>plan</b> for command area of Pamba-Achankovil-Vaippar (PAV) link project, Kerala, India. The <b>crop</b> <b>planning</b> model considers various resource constraints (land area, seeds, manure, fertilizers etc.) availability etc. adaptive to national conditions, with the objective to maximize net irrigation benefits. For <b>crop</b> <b>planning,</b> the extent of quantity available for fertilizers, manure and seeds as inputs were unknown.

40|$|In {{order to}} analyse and {{evaluate}} the future development of organic farming in Denmark efforts are needed to extend and improve the data on labour and machinery input. Previous investigations have not been able, in a uniquely way, to describe the labour requirement related to factors like farm type, type of production, level of mechanisation, etc. Existing modelling approaches on labour demand and machinery input, used for conventional farms, has only been scarcely used on organic farming systems. There {{is a need for}} a systematic analysis of the technical operational consequences and subsequent prognosis of the labour requirement, capacity, and labour profiles for specific organic production systems, including the evaluation of innovative cropping and mechanisation systems. The latter is important, as the continuing development of organic farming systems will probably imply an increased application of innovative types of machinery and systems, which are specifically adapted to the principles of organic farming. A number of model farms illustrating “future organic farms” have been designed. For these farms the analyses of the labour and machinery systems dependent on different technological assumptions (existing and new innovative technologies) have been carried out. The analyses comprise all work operations in the field and the animal houses together with a selection of machinery types and an estimation of machinery sizes. The analysis use prerequisites like <b>cropping</b> <b>plan,</b> an optimised animal manure application, norm yields adjusted to the <b>cropping</b> <b>plan,</b> etc. The output from the analysis comprises labour profiles, labour budgets related to the specific fields, to the specific crops, to the specific periods (week, months, etc.), to the specific machines or treatments, etc. The labour demand for the production farms range from 6. 1 to 16. 6 h ha- 1 and from 16. 5 h LU- 1 to 39. 6 h LU- 1 for work in the animal houses. Also, results indicate that the inclusion of row crops in the <b>cropping</b> <b>plan</b> demand a high labour input, which would reduce the uptake of row crops in the <b>cropping</b> <b>plan.</b> In terms of labour input, organic cattle production is comparable with conventional cattle production. Current as well as innovative technologies and work methods related to organic farming have been identified and evaluated.

As examples, the new technologies chosen consist of a weeding robot and an integrated system for thermal band treatment. The selected technologies are either available or have been tested as a prototype technology. The labour demand is reduced by 80 - 85...|$|E

Crops are planted without perfect knowledge of weather or markets, unpredictable economic or political events may occur. This article studied on cropping planning under price uncertainty, connected with diversification of cropping with the upland irrigation developing project in southernarea of the Osumi Peninsula of Kagoshima Prefecture in Japan. {{in this area}} main type of farming is mixed farming of rice, vegitable and beefcalf production, and each farm scale is very small, and farmers are very old. Farmers ded not expect to increase their income, because {{of the failure of}} replantation occurred in his upland. The purpose of this project is to promote the vegetable production {{which is one of the}} main crop in this area. but vegetable prices are very fluctuating. For that reason this fluctuation must be considered for <b>cropping</b> <b>plan</b> in this area. For making the <b>cropping</b> <b>plan,</b> we took the marketing research on wholesale prices of vegetables shipped from this area to Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka and Kagoshima Central Wholesale Markets, and then calculated farm income to each marketing case. The optimal marketing plan is made under consideration of an average income and its coefficient of variation. And for the Risk Programming Model, variance and covariance have been calculated from the income fluctuation of each crop. The E-V (expected income-variance) criterion is attractive for farm planning. The Quadratic Programming Model, as developed as a useful method to consider uncertainty in farm planning. The Quadratic Programming Model can be define as follows. (snip). Using this criterion, we obtained the set of efficient cropping plans and suggested the farmer to make the final choice. The results of this study can be summarized as follows: (1) In this irrigation project, we made a plan with an attractive effects to farming in this area. This project make increase of farm income 1. 3 - 1. 5 times in comparision with actual type of farming. (2) We compared the E-V criterion to the Game theoretic criterion, especially Sevege criterion.

Modification of crop location can thus {{be a way to}} reduce damage caused by runoff as flooding of properties. Crop location depends on decisions taken at farm level. Studies conducted in Northern France about farmers’ decision-making shown that cash crops farmers differed in their leeway to modify crop location a given year. Leeway depends on farm territory characteristics, crops requierment and farm <b>cropping</b> <b>plan.</b> In these previous studies, farmers’ leeway is expressed by the proportion of farm arable land suitable for different crops to be sown. This proportion is assessed from farmer’s decision-making simulation. This method is precise but the disadvantage is that it is long to implement and that it requires a lot of information concerning crop management in the analysed farms. This paper proposes a simpler and quicker method enabling to assess whether there are or not leeway to modify crop location in a given farm. The proposed method consists in calculating an indicator based on the knowledge of the farm <b>cropping</b> <b>plan</b> and the elementary agronomic rules of crop location (i. e. for a given crop: cultivable area, waiting period and possible preceding crops). The indicator gives the proportion of crops that can be sown in several fields. Firstly we calculated this indicator for the 14 main farms of the Bourville catchment (Pays de Caux, Upper-Normandy, France) with specific agronomic rules given by each interviewed farmer. According to the indicator farms were separated into two groups: four farms with almost no leeway to modify crop location and ten farms with potential leeway. A comparison of this classification with a more precise analyse available from a previous study (based on farmers’ decision-making simulation) showed that this simpler assessment methodology is reliable. Secondly, we assessed farmers’ leeway with agronomic rules common for all farms. Indeed, some rules given by certain farmers were more restrictive than rules given by the other farmers: this led to minimise leeway. This second classification showed that leeway are more important in most of the farms, but still different from one farm to another. These differences are due to the different characteristics of farms territories and farms cropping plans...|$|E

This paradigm allows to design expressive and realistic agents, yet, it is rarely used in simulation context. A reason is that most agent architectures based on the BDI paradigm are complex to understand by non-computer-scientists. Moreover, they are often very time-consuming in terms of computation. In this paper, we propose a new architecture based on the BDI paradigm that copes with these two issues. In our architecture, the choice of the most relevant action by an agent is based on the belief theory. We present an application of our agent architecture to an actual model dedicated to <b>cropping</b> <b>plan</b> decision-making. This application that takes into plays thousands of farmer agents shows promising results...|$|E
40|$|In the savannahs of Central Africa, the {{cultivation}} of cotton, a strategically important crop in the national economy and in the income of producers, and inseparable from State control through cotton companies, is in crisis. This communication {{is based on the}} evolution of cotton policies, adaptive strategies and the assistance of farmers in this crisis. It focuses on studies on family farms and strategies of producers, and also on support-advice activities carried out in cotton zones of Cameroon, Chad and Central African Republic between 2000 and 2007 under the framework of the regional pole of applied research for the development of Central African savannahs. The important financial deficits brought about by the dysfunction of the system in place and in the drop in cotton prices have led to an ongoing restructuring process of the sectors with the view of a subsequent disengagement of the State and the promotion of professional organisations. In this difficult financial context, the cotton surface areas globally reduce and farmers develop reconstruction strategies of their activities, being either the increase or the abandonment of {{the cultivation}} of cotton in the <b>cropping</b> <b>plan.</b> These defensive strategies have a social cost that farmers are trying t...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 This study uses {{a dynamic}} linear program to {{determine}} the optimum cropping pattern which should {{be followed by a}} specific San Joaquin Valley, California, farm in order to maximize returns to fixed factors of production. The study combines as much pertinent information as could be gained from personal interviews with the specific Case Farm's managers. The study also draws on previous production and cost analysis data of California conditions in order to build a complete linear program model. The Case Farm's linear program activities are confined mainly to field crops; cotton, barley, milo, alfalfa, safflower, and sugar beets and some related activities such as fallow land and double cropping. The linear program restrictions directly include availability of land of various degrees of fertility, the availability of irrigation water and federal cotton allotment programs. The availability of equipment at critical times of the crop season is also considered. The dynamic aspect of the linear program occurs because the Case Farm's rotational policy is included. The program selects an optimum <b>crop</b> <b>plan</b> for three years based on the crops being grown in the initial year. The optimum <b>crop</b> <b>plan</b> selected by the dynamic linear program appears to be consistent with known data and capable of being operational as far as the managers of the Case Farm are concerned. There is also evidence that the economic benefits gained from making future <b>crop</b> <b>plans</b> with the aid of this dynamic linear program will outweigh the cost of developing and executing the linear program model...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} four {{strategies of}} a novel evolutionary algorithm, multi-objective differential evolution algorithm (MDEA). The four strategies namely, MDEA 1, MDEA 2, MDEA 3 and MDEA 4 are adapted to solve the multi-objective <b>crop</b> <b>planning</b> model with multiple constraints in a farmland in the Vaalharts irrigation scheme (VIS) in South Africa. The three objectives of the model are to minimize the total irrigation water (m 2) and to maximize both the total net income in South African Rand (ZAR) from farming and the total agricultural output in tons. The total area of the farm is 771, 000 m 2 and supplied with 704, 694 m 2 of irrigation water annually. Numerical results produce non-dominated solutions which converge to Pareto optimal fronts. MDEA 1 and MDEA 2 strategies with binomial crossover method are better for solving the <b>crop</b> <b>planning</b> problem presented than MDEA 3 and MDEA 4 strategies with exponential crossover method. MDEA 1 found a solution with the highest total net income of ZAR 1, 304, 600 with the corresponding total agricultural output, total irrigation water and total planting areas of 316. 26 tons, 702, 000 m 3 and 725, 000 m 2, respectively. The planting areas for the crops in the solution are 73, 463 m 2 for maize, 551, 660 m 2 for groundnut, 50, 000 m 2 for Lucerne and 50, 000 m 2 for Peacan nut. It can be concluded that MDEA is a good algorithm for solving <b>crop</b> <b>planning</b> problem especially in water deficient areas like South Africa.
