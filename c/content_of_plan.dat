The study analyses how the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>plans</b> and interviews prepared by 23 police recruits changes on four occasions during their training at the Western Australia Police Academy, and {{whether there is a}} relationship between the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>plans</b> and interviews. On each occasion, undergraduate students acted as witnesses, watching a short film depicting a mock crime before being interviewed by one of the recruits. To facilitate analysis, the items in plans and the questions and statements in interviews were coded according to what aspect of the PEACE model of interviewing they related (e. g., Engage and explain, Account, clarification and challenge [Account] or Closure). The findings show that recruits emphasise the Account stage in their plans and interviews while neglecting the Engage and explain and Closure stages of the model. Further, findings show an association between the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>plans</b> and interviews, particularly with regard to the Engage and explain stage of the model. Encouragingly, recruits were found to increase the proportion of items relating to the Closure stage in plans and interviews following training. Implications of the findings are discussed with particular regard to their application in training recruits...|$|R

40|$|Basin {{plans have}} become a core element of water {{management}} in the 21 st century. Systematic analytical scrutiny <b>of</b> the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> basin <b>plans</b> is nonetheless scant. This paper develops a framework for assessing basin plans and systematically applies it to understand how <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> basin <b>plans</b> vary. The paper synthesizes a definition of ‘basin plan’, generates a classification system for basin plans, and proceeds to classify a regionally diverse set <b>of</b> 23 basin <b>plans.</b> Major findings are that basin plans typically contain the components and sub-components suggested in best practice guidelines. Focus on some issues that are presumably central to water management such as water quality and quantity is nonetheless comparatively low. Disaggregating basin plans suggests that developing country transboundary plans are more geared toward hydropower development, navigation and coping with uncertainty, while developed country and national plans appear {{to focus more on}} issues such as water quality and fish management. It is hoped that findings contained in this paper support future basin plan development by informing those crafting basin <b>plans</b> <b>of</b> the options available to them...|$|R
