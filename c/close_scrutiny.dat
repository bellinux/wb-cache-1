5|$|Around {{half of the}} Grenztruppen were conscripts, a lower {{proportion}} than {{in other}} branches of the East German armed forces. Many potential recruits were screened out as potentially unreliable; for instance, actively religious individuals or those with close relatives in West Germany.

Graf even managed to play football when a Luftwaffe team played against Cyclope Bucharesti at the Bucharest Sports Arena before 30,000 spectators. During its time in Romania, the unit was witness to a major earthquake in November and an abortive civil war in January.|$|E
5|$|In Thio Li-ann's view, {{it appears}} that the High Court allowed the matter to be decided {{according}} to the subjective discretion of the Minister. The only explanation given for deregistration was that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service was contrary to the public interest. The Court did not require the executive to elaborate on exactly how a failure to perform national service would be contrary to public interest. It accepted the executive's discretion to derogate a fundamental right without a <b>close</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of the executive's rationale and explanations.|$|E

He would wear the customized boots until his retirement, though they were so delicate that he got through countless pairs every season.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{left the}} Centralia area on September 27, pursued {{for the first}} time by Union forces {{equipped}} with artillery. Anderson evaded the pursuit, leading his men into ravines that the Union troops would not enter for fear of ambush. In the aftermath of the attacks, Union soldiers committed several revenge killings of Confederate-sympathizing civilians. They burned Rocheport to the ground on October 2; the town was under <b>close</b> <b>scrutiny</b> by Union forces, owing to the number of Confederate sympathizers there, but General Fisk maintained that the fire was accidental. Anderson watched the fire from nearby bluffs.|$|E

40|$|This review {{steps back}} from the burgeoning {{economics}} literature on measuring social preferences and considers more carefully the empirical evidence from the lab and the field.

The third set of claims highlights important theoretical and empirical investigations that need to be done to further our understanding of the nature and import of social preferences. nonstandard preferences, lab and field experiments...|$|R

In 2007, a rheumatoid arthritis patient died from an infection; the subsequent investigation concluded that the death was not related to gene therapy.|$|E
25|$|Farmers, acreage {{owners and}} other {{interested}} parties quickly made their concerns known. The competing corporations were required to respond to these concerns, so the Caroline experience made public consultation {{an integral part of}} planning.

When they recognized that public consultation had become critical to the winning bid, the companies raised community relations to a new level.|$|E
25|$|<b>Close</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of {{corporate}} governance and greater responsibility placed on directors to vouch for the reports {{submitted to the}} SEC and other federal agencies, {{have resulted in the}} growth of software solutions aimed at reducing the complexity, time and expense involved in creating the reports. This trend accelerated in 2008 {{with the passage of the}} Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Software as a service (SaaS) products allow corporate directors and internal auditors to assemble and analyze financial and other relevant data—including unstructured data—and create the needed reports quickly and without the need of an outside vendor.|$|E

25|$|When the California {{electricity}} crisis {{slammed the}} state in 2001, Davis was blasted for his slow and ineffective response. His approval rating dropped into the 30s and never recovered. When the energy crisis settled down, Davis's administration {{was hit with a}} fund-raising scandal. California had a $95 million contract with Oracle Corporation that was found to be unnecessary and overpriced by the state auditor. Three of Davis's aides were fired or resigned after it was revealed that the governor's technology adviser accepted a $25,000 campaign contribution shortly after the contract was signed. The money was returned, but the scandal fueled <b>close</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of Davis's fundraising for his 2002 re-election bid.|$|E
25|$|Despite Sheridan's later {{criticism}} of Warren for moving slowly and his removal of Warren from command the next day, when {{at the end}} of the Battle of White Oak Road Warren heard the sound of the distant battle receding toward Dinwiddie Court House, he sent Brigadier General Joseph J. Bartlett's brigade of Griffin's division to reinforce Sheridan intending that Bartlett attack Pickett's flank. Moving cross country, Bartlett's men drove Confederate pickets from Dr. Boisseau's farm, just east of Crump Road. Since it was dark when Bartlett's men reach Gravelly Run, they did not try to cross but engaged the Confederates on the other side with sniper fire. The dark night hid the size of Bartlett's force from <b>close</b> <b>scrutiny.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, {{issues with}} the {{president}} over the authority circled and a subsequent political stand off was instigated between president and Prime minister. Finally, in July 1993, Sharif resigned {{under pressure from the}} Pakistan Armed Forces but negotiated a settlement that resulted in the removal of president Ghulam Ishaq Khan as well. In July 1993, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Shamim Allam and the Chief of Army Staff General Abdul Vahied Kakar forced president Ishaq Khan to resign from the presidency and subsequently ended the political standoff. Under the <b>close</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of the Pakistan Armed Forces, the new interim and transitional government was formed and new parliamentary election were held after three months.|$|E

25|$|In a less {{scholarly}} treatment, authors Brian Kilmeade and Don Yaeger {{speculate that}} she had motive to work against the crown but she also had reason not to. British law said that lands could be confiscated if left abandoned, which forced Anna to remain behind when her husband left for Connecticut. For this reason, they suggest, it is possible Anna would not have wanted to risk losing their home. Her children were also with her, so her arrest would have left those children parentless. Additionally, her family was already under <b>close</b> <b>scrutiny</b> since her husband was a known dissident. They offer no facts about Strong and her activities in support of these opinions or anything to contradict other sources noted here.|$|E
25|$|Since Euclid, {{geometry}} {{had meant}} {{the geometry of}} Euclidean space of two dimensions (plane geometry) or of three dimensions (solid geometry). In {{the first half of}} the nineteenth century there had been several developments complicating the picture. Mathematical applications required geometry of four or more dimensions; the <b>close</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of the foundations of the traditional Euclidean geometry had revealed the independence of the parallel postulate from the others, and non-Euclidean geometry had been born. Klein proposed an idea that all these new geometries are just special cases of the projective geometry, as already developed by Poncelet, Möbius, Cayley and others. Klein also strongly suggested to mathematical physicists that even a moderate cultivation of the projective purview might bring substantial benefits to them.|$|E
25|$|In {{the later}} novels, the only crime {{which he can}} be seen to commit might be illegal entry, when he and Paul Drake are searching for evidence. And even then, he would expect to put up a strong and {{effective}} defense leading to an acquittal. Hamilton Burger is constantly under the impression that Mason has done something illegal, but is never able to prove it. Gardner prefaced many of his later novels with tributes to coroners and forensic pathologists whose work was instrumental to solving cases. Gardner inserts his ideas about the importance of proper autopsies into many of his Mason novels. In The Case of the Fugitive Nurse, for instance, <b>close</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of dental records in the identification of burned bodies is a key point. In that same story, the possible use of additives to track illegal resale of medical narcotics is examined.|$|E
