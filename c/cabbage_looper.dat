50|$|Big-eyed bugs {{are true}} bugs {{in the order}} Hemiptera. The two most common species are Geocoris pallens and Geocoris punctipes. Both are predators and occur in many habitats, {{including}} fields, gardens, and turf grass. Big-eyed bugs are considered an important predator in many agricultural systems and feed on mites, insect eggs, and small insects such as pink bollworm, <b>cabbage</b> <b>loopers,</b> and whiteflies. Adult big-eyed bugs are small (about 3 mm) black, gray, or tan with proportionately large eyes. Eggs are deposited singly or in clusters on leaves near potential prey. They develop with incomplete metamorphosis (there is no pupa) and take approximately 30 days to develop from egg to adult depending on temperature. Both nymphs and adults are predatory, but can survive on nectar and honeydew when prey are scarce. Big-eyed bugs, like other true bugs, have piercing-sucking mouthparts and feed by stabbing their prey and sucking or lapping the juices.

We sought to define JAs and OPDA functions through comparative defense susceptibility characteristics of three Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genotypes: aos, lacking JAs and OPDA; opda reductase 3 (opr 3), deficient in JA production but can accumulate OPDA; and transgenics that overexpress OPR 3. opr 3, like aos, is susceptible to <b>cabbage</b> <b>loopers</b> (Trichoplusia ni) but, relative to aos, opr 3 has enhanced resistance to a necrotrophic fungus. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry reveals that opr 3 produces OPDA but no detectable JAs following wounding and looper infestation; unexpectedly, substantial levels of JAs accumulate in opr 3 upon fungal infection. Full-length OPR 3 transcripts accumulate in fungal-infected opr 3, potentially through splicing of the T-DNA containing intron. Fungal resistance correlates with levels of JAs not OPDA; therefore, opr 3 resistance to some pests is likely due to JA accumulation, and signaling activities ascribed to OPDA should be reassessed because opr 3 can produce JAs. Together these data (1) reinforce the primary role JAs play in plant defense against insects and necrotrophic fungi, (2) argue for a reassessment of signaling activities ascribed to OPDA, and (3) provide evidence that mutants with intron insertions can retain gene function...|$|R
40|$|Agriculture in {{the vast}} {{majority}} of the United States has to manage around the winter weather. Winter synchronizes pest populations by creating a common starting point. Insect species unable to overwinter must rely on dispersal to reinfest northern areas or develop methods to exploit the overwintering area. The simple but useful formula: (Population = Birth – Death + /- Dispersal) is a tool to highlight the importance of dispersal. Pest populations are predictable due to the synchronization and common starting point of the crop and pest. Dispersal of adult stages is enhanced via high pressure cells that lift the insects upward and further enchased via wind activity of a surface low level jet stream is created at the boundary of a western counter –clock flow of a low and a clockwise air movement of a high to the east. The cumulative effect of the wind directions around each of these pressure cells creates a strong current northward.

40|$|High tunnels are {{a form of}} {{protected}} agriculture that aids in season extension by creating a favorable microclimate using trapped solar heat. Tunnel structure {{is similar to a}} simple greenhouse, usually comprised of stretched plastic over a large ribbed frame. High tunnels are used extensively around the world for the production of high value crops. In 2010, the USDA-NRCS initiated a high tunnel funding program that aided in the erection of 4, 500 new high tunnels across the U. S. in 2010 and 2011. As high tunnel use continues to rise, basic research is needed in this production system to investigate its effectiveness and begin developing specialized IPM solutions to pest-related problems. This study involved production of three crops: tomato, broccoli, and cucumber in three high tunnels as well as three comparison field plots over the 2010 and 2011 growing seasons. Season extension, yield, and fruit quality (size and marketability) were compared among traditional field plots and three different production systems within the tunnels: traditional black plastic mulch, containerized soilless production, and rockwool; however, the rockwool system was quickly abandoned after several failed attempts to maintain plant quality. Season extension was the most dramatic for tomatoes—fruit was harvested in the high tunnels more than two months before the field. Tomato size was also larger in the tunnels and there was a greater percentage of marketable fruit compared to the field. Conversely yield was not significantly different between production systems in the tunnel and the field for tomatoes. There {{was no significant difference in}} the broccoli or cucumber size between the high tunnel and the field; however, high tunnel yield was significantly greater for cucumbers and broccoli. There was no significant difference in the cucumber marketability, but broccoli marketability was significantly higher in the field. The containerized soilless production within the tunnel showed no significant advantages [...] decreased yields, smaller fruit, and lower fruit marketability. Pest density was also compared between the high tunnel and the field. Greenhouse pests were more prevalent in the high tunnels throughout the season. Common field pests such as hornworms and cucumber beetles were not significantly different between the high tunnel and the field; however the crucifer caterpillar complex including imported cabbageworms, diamond back moths, and <b>cabbage</b> <b>loopers</b> was significantly denser within the high tunnels. Multiple insecticide treatments were made in the high tunnels for various pests throughout the season. These results show that pest density is not significantly different in high tunnels compared to the field—implementing integrated pest management techniques is necessary in high tunnels just as it is in the field; however components may need optimized for this specialized form of production. Further research should aid in developing IPM decision making protocols for high tunnel producers. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Three {{species of}} bacteriophagous nematodes, Pristionchus lheritieri (Maupas) Paramanov, Pelodera chitwoodi (Bassen) Dougherty and Rhabditis sp. were studied to {{determine}} their potential roles as vectors of selected insect pathogens, Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner, Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin, Metarrhizium anisopliae (Metchnikoff) Sorokin and a nuclear polyhedrosis virus of Trichoplusia ni Hubner. Chlorine tolerances were established for P. lheritieri, P. chitwoodi and Rhabditis sp. Investigations established that B. thuringiensis was more susceptible to the action of chlorine than the nematodes. Feeding studies provided evidence that B. thuringiensis is an unsatisfactory monoxenic associate of P. lheritieri. Chlorination treatments following feeding of B. thuringiensis allowed the development of evidence that all three nematode species do ingest and defecate B. thuringiensis in a viable condition. It was demonstrated that P. lheritieri and Rhabditis sp. retained viable B. thuringiensis up to 36 and 42 hr respectively. P. lheritieri and Rhabditis sp. continued to defecate viable B. thuringiensis up to 33 and 36 hr respectively. Attempts to infect T. ni directly with B. thuringiensis fed nematodes failed. Subcultures of B. thuringiensis defecated by P. lheritieri retained their pathogenicity to T. ni, The insect pathogenic fungi B. bassiana and M. anisopliae {{proved to be more}} susceptible to the action of chlorine than the bacteriophagous nematodes. The studies indicate that B. bassiana and M. anisopliae are not a preferred food source for P. lheritieri. Evidence for ingestion of M. anisopliae by P. lheritieri was not obtained. Results failed to demonstrate defecation of viable spores of either fungus. Viable spores of B. bassiana were recovered from the gut of P. lheritieri and subcultured. The subcultured B. bassiana retained pathogenicity to larvae of T. ni. P. lheritieri were positively attracted to and actively fed on the cadavers of nuclear polyhedrosis killed T. ni larvae. Single nematodes, after feeding on T. ni larvae killed by virus, transmitted the virus to <b>cabbage</b> <b>loopers.</b> The nuclear polyhedrosis virus of T. ni proved to be less susceptible to chlorination treatments than the bacteriophagous nematodes. Evidence for active ingestion of virus particles by the nematode was developed by obtaining inoculum suspensions from nematodes which had been exposed to a virus source for various periods of time. A bioassay of these suspensions revealed an apparently greater virulence in those suspensions produced from nematodes having a longer access to virus. These studies provided evidence that bacteriophagous nematodes can have an important role in insect disease development in nature. The nematodes acquired viable fungus, bacterial, and virus pathogens by active ingestion. They retained and actively disseminated bacterial pathogens over an adequate period of time. A fungus pathogen retained virulence after ingestion by the nematode and a bacterial pathogen retained viability and pathogenicity after passage through the nematode gut. A single nematode transmitted enough virus inoculum to cause disease in the insect host. Of the nematode-pathogen associations studied, the intensely virulent nematode-virus complex demonstrated potential for biological control utilization. These factors, added to the mobility, habits, and known insect associations of bacteriophagous nematodes, enhance our understanding of the potential roles of these nematodes in insect disease development...|$|R
50|$|The PiggyBac (PB) {{transposon}} {{from the}} <b>cabbage</b> <b>looper</b> moth Trichoplusia ni was engineered {{to be highly}} active in mammalian cells, and is capable of genome-wide mutagenesis. Transposons contained both PB and Sleeping Beauty inverted repeats, {{in order to be}} recognized by both transposases and increase the frequency of transposition. In addition, the transposon contained promoter and enhancer elements, a splice donor and acceptors to allow gain- or loss-of-function mutations depending on the transposon's orientation, and bidirectional polyadenylation signals. The transposons were transformed into mouse cells in vitro and mutants containing tumours were analyzed. The mechanism of the mutation leading to tumour formation determined if the gene was classified as an oncogene or a tumour-suppressor gene. Oncogenes tended to be characterized by insertions in regions leading to overexpression of a gene, whereas tumour-suppressor genes were classified as such based on loss-of-function mutations. Since the mouse is a model organism for the study of human physiology and disease, this research will help lead to an increased understanding of cancer-causing genes and potential therapeutic targets.|$|E
5000|$|Inducible {{defenses}} allow {{plants to}} be phenotypically plastic. This may confer {{an advantage over}} constitutive defenses for multiple reasons. First, it may reduce the chance that attacking insects adapt to plant defenses. [...] Simply, inducible defenses cause variations in the defense constituents of a plant, thereby making the plant a more unpredictable environment for insect herbivores. This variability has an important effect on the fitness and behaviour of herbivores. For example, the study of herbivory on radish (Raphanus sativus) by the <b>cabbage</b> <b>looper</b> caterpillar (Trichoplusia ni) demonstrated that the variation of defensive chemicals (glucosinolates) in R. sativus, due to induction, resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} the pupation rates of T. ni. In essence, defensive chemicals can be viewed as having a particular dosage-dependent effect on herbivores: it has little detrimental effect on herbivores when present at a low or moderate dose, but has dramatic effects at higher concentrations. Hence, a plant which produces variable levels of defensive chemicals is better defended than one that always produces the mean level of toxin.|$|E

When prey are scarce, the spined soldier bug may feed on plant juices, but this feeding is not reported to cause plant damage. Podisus maculiventris is associated with several crops including alfalfa, apples, asparagus, beans, celery, cotton, crucifers, cucurbits, eggplant, potatoes, onions, soybeans, sweet corn and tomatoes. The effectiveness of this species in preying on economic pests resulted in its use in classical biological control programs in other countries, including Eastern Europe and Russia.
