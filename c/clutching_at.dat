25|$|The French, all but {{masters of}} Spain in June, stood {{with their backs}} to the Pyrenees, <b>clutching</b> <b>at</b> Navarre and Catalonia. It was not known if even these two footholds could be {{maintained}} {{in the face of a}} Spanish attack. By October French strength in Spain, including garrisons, was about 75,000 soldiers. They were facing 86,000 Spanish troops with Spain's 35,000 British allies en route.|$|E
500|$|John Masefield, {{who knew}} Synge, {{wrote that he}} [...] "gave one from the first the {{impression}} of a strange personality". Masefield felt that Synge's view of life originated with his poor health. In particular, Masefield claimed that [...] "His relish of the savagery made me feel that he was a dying man <b>clutching</b> <b>at</b> life, and clutching most wildly at violent life, as the sick man does".|$|E
500|$|Post-match {{analysis}} showed that referee Oliver had erroneously awarded the corner kick from which Gillingham's goal had been scored, as the ball had in fact come off Barcham and therefore a goal kick should instead have been awarded to Shrewsbury. [...] Paul Simpson referred to this in his post-match comments, but said that [...] "if we look at things like {{that we will be}} <b>clutching</b> <b>at</b> straws". [...] Mark Stimson highlighted the financial benefits of his team's promotion, noting that large crowds would be expected for matches in League One against Leeds United, Norwich City and Southampton.|$|E
60|$|As a {{drowning}} man <b>clutches</b> <b>at</b> a straw, so the Cardinal-Prince Louis de Rohan, Grand Almoner of France, Landgrave of Alsace, Commander of the Order of the Holy Ghost, <b>clutched</b> <b>at</b> this faiseuse d'affaires {{to help him}} in his desperate need.|$|R
60|$|He slid {{from his}} seat and disappeared. Jill <b>clutched</b> <b>at</b> Derek.|$|R

500|$|On hearing Amfortas' cry, {{the youth}} appears to suffer with him, <b>clutching</b> <b>at</b> his heart. The knights and Titurel urge Amfortas {{to reveal the}} Grail (""), and he finally does. The dark hall is now bathed {{in the light of}} the Grail as the Knights eat. Gurnemanz motions to the youth to participate, but he seems entranced and does not. Amfortas does not share in taking communion and, as the {{ceremony}} ends, collapses in pain and is carried away. Slowly the hall empties leaving only the young man and Gurnemanz, who asks him if he has understood what he has seen. When the lad cannot answer, Gurnemanz dismisses him as just a fool and sends him out with a warning to hunt geese, if he must, but to leave the swans alone. A voice from high above repeats the promise: [...] "The pure fool, enlightened by compassion".|$|E
500|$|When {{asked why}} he was {{compelled}} to revisit the Velázquez so often, Bacon replied that he had nothing against popes per se, but merely sought [...] "an excuse to use these colours, and you can't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting {{into a sort of}} false fauve manner." [...] Schmied sees HeadVI as a reaction against Velázquez, and a commentary on how the papacy is [...] "obsolete and decayed", with a pope resistant to both modernisation and secularisation. To him, the figure seems to [...] "resist the maltreatment of image and tries to halt the impending collapse of the established work order. He screams and grimaces, <b>clutching</b> <b>at</b> arms of his throne." [...] Sylvester notes that Bacon was impressed by Picasso's figuration and handling of paint, especially in Picasso's 1930s works; and suggests that the white blobs around the pope's cape may be influenced by the 1913 Woman in a Slip Seated in an Armchair.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} {{has been discussed}} {{in a variety of}} publications. Hilary Kingsley in her book Soapbox discusses Mavis's reticent and moralistic personality as seen in her drinking habits: Mavis drinks fruit juices, but on special occasions sweet sherry: [...] "two for Mavis is one too many" [...] says Kingsley. In a 1983 issue of New Statesman magazine, Mavis is described as having a face that is [...] "never quite sure of its own shape". The author describes the storyline featuring Mavis facing the prospect of a trial marriage or losing her boyfriend {{as an example of the}} [...] "either-or situations" [...] into which soap opera is [...] "forever ensnaring its characters". An article in the Evening Standard said Mavis was [...] "meek and mild" [...] and [...] "would not say boo to a budgie". In the same newspaper Mark Walton-Cook discusses Mavis's style, stating: [...] "I keep picturing Corrie's Mavis Riley twittering and <b>clutching</b> <b>at</b> the high neck of a securely fastened polyester blouse with a tasteful cameo brooch".|$|E
60|$|He {{took another}} step toward the door. A shaking hand <b>clutched</b> <b>at</b> his sleeve.|$|R
60|$|With {{one hand}} he <b>clutched</b> <b>at</b> the hand-rail, then with both. For {{a moment the}} two men stood swaying. Then suddenly, with a violent jerk, Horrocks had twisted him from his hold. He <b>clutched</b> <b>at</b> Horrocks and missed, his foot went back into empty air; in mid-air he twisted himself, and then cheek and {{shoulder}} and knee struck the hot cone together.|$|R
60|$|He <b>clutched</b> <b>at</b> her. She {{was out of}} range, {{and getting}} farther away every instant.|$|R
500|$|Smith Hempstone {{later wrote}} that the former Prime Minister had {{resolved}} to [...] "go down... with all rhetorical guns blazing". This was in spite of increasingly unstable health; in June 1982 he collapsed in the House of Assembly, <b>clutching</b> <b>at</b> his side and shaking. Half {{a year later he}} had to arrange treatment in South Africa for a condition stemming from hardening of the arteries. The government's confiscation of his passport and two refusals of its return prevented him from going, so in April 1983 Smith successfully applied for a British passport. [...] "I'll still try to get my Zimbabwean passport back," [...] he said. [...] "I was born here and that is the passport I should travel on." [...] Smith regained his Zimbabwean papers after about a year. In 1984 he declared his intention to renounce his British nationality to abide by a new Zimbabwean law outlawing multiple citizenship. Britain did not recognise this legislation; according to Smith, British officials refused to take his UK passport when he tried to return it.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, Elf Power's record Vainly <b>Clutching</b> <b>at</b> Phantom Limbs {{featured}} a song named [...] "Loverboy's Demise" [...] which describes a Loverboy concert.|$|E
2500|$|Chaudhry derided {{the revelations}} as [...] "laughable," [...] {{and said that}} they showed no {{connection}} whatsoever between himself and India's Exim Bank, or with the Indian government loan. [...] "It was clear that having made wild baseless allegations, the PM was <b>clutching</b> <b>at</b> straws to try and validate his claims," [...] Chaudhry said. [...] "There is absolutely no connection between the loan and a letter that I wrote to PM’s steering committee Charles Walker as chairman on sugar industry reforms that Qarase released to the media as his ‘proof’ that I had received a commission from the loan," [...] he added. [...] Nor did it substantiate, he said, Qarase's claims that he had sought a commission from the Indian companies.|$|E

60|$|It {{was here}} that the regrettable {{incident}} occurred. Just as the second prisoner was being launched, Constable Butt, determined to assert himself even at the eleventh hour, sprang forward, and seized the captive by the arm. A drowning man will <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> a straw. A man about to be hurled into an excessively dirty pond will <b>clutch</b> <b>at</b> a stout policeman. The prisoner did.|$|R
2500|$|Fairyflies {{include the}} {{smallest}} known insect, Dicopomorpha echmepterygis from Costa Rica, which have males {{that are only}} [...] long. They do not have wings or eyes, their mouths are mere holes, and their antennae are simply spherical blobs. The ends of their legs have been modified into suction cups for <b>clutching</b> <b>at</b> females long enough to fertilize them. They are so small, their entire bodies are smaller than a single-celled Paramecium. Four male individuals, lined up end-to-end, would just about encompass {{the width of a}} period {{at the end of a}} typical printed sentence. The females of the species, however, are typical fairyflies, and are much larger. The smallest flying insect is also a mymarid, Kikiki huna from Hawaii, which is [...] long.|$|E
2500|$|... "Video Games" [...] is {{four minutes}} and 42 seconds long (4:42). The song was written and {{composed}} by Elizabeth Grant (Lana Del Rey) and Justin Parker {{in the key}} of F minor. Set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 123 beats per minute, Del Rey's vocal range spans from E3 to A4. Lindsey Johnstone of The Scotsman described the song as an [...] "ode to being ignored and the exquisite pain of <b>clutching</b> <b>at</b> an illusion of happiness". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian praised how Del Rey's vocal performance, against ballooning orchestration and pizzicato strings, overlapped the subdued theme of an aloof, beer-drinking boyfriend figure. Del Rey described her music and day-to-day style as [...] "gangsta Nancy Sinatra", with contemporary critics noting the song as a doom-filled ballad that unapologetically displays vulnerability.|$|E
2500|$|After a long fall, the two {{crashed into}} a deep {{subterranean}} lake, which extinguished the flames of the Balrog's body; however it remained [...] "a thing of slime, stronger than a strangling snake". They fought in the water, with the Balrog <b>clutching</b> <b>at</b> Gandalf to strangle him, and Gandalf hewing the Balrog with his sword, until finally the Balrog fled into ancient tunnels of unknown origin. Gandalf pursued the creature for eight days, until they climbed to the peak of Zirakzigil, where the Balrog was forced to turn and fight once again, its body erupting into new flame. Here they fought for two days and nights. In the end, the Balrog was defeated and cast down, breaking the mountainside where it fell [...] "in ruin". Gandalf himself died shortly afterwards, but he was later sent back to Middle-earth with even greater powers, as Gandalf the White, [...] "until his task was finished".|$|E

2500|$|Cryer {{was elected}} {{mayor of the}} City of Los Angeles in 1921 in a close {{election}} against the incumbent Meredith P. Snyder. [...] Cryer's campaign promised to close the [...] "dens of vice," [...] and attacked Snyder as being corrupt and unfit to be mayor. [...] The Los Angeles Police Commissioner sent a telegram to the newspapers before the election asking, [...] "Shall crime and protected vice continue, or will the voters and taxpayers elect George E. Cryer mayor?" [...] Cryer billed himself as a non-politician: [...] "I know nothing about politics, and I shall never be a politician. [...] I have an idea that {{the business of the}} City of Los Angeles can be conducted like any other business ... quietly, effectively, efficiently." [...] The Los Angeles Times backed Cryer, noting, [...] "To talk with George E. Cryer is to know instinctively that he is not a politician <b>clutching</b> <b>at</b> straws for a 'platform,' but that he is a quiet, effective man who does things." ...|$|E
