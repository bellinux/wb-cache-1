25|$|Sodium acetate is {{also used}} in heating pads, hand warmers, and hot ice. Sodium acetate trihydrate {{crystals}} melt at 136.4°F/58°C (to 137.12°F/58.4°C), dissolving in their water of crystallization. When they are heated past the melting point and subsequently allowed to cool, the aqueous solution becomes supersaturated. This solution is capable of cooling to room temperature without forming crystals. By pressing on a metal disc within the heating pad, a nucleation center is formed, causing the solution to crystallize back into solid sodium acetate trihydrate. The bond-forming process of crystallization is exothermic. The {{latent heat of fusion}} is about 264–289kJ/kg. Unlike some types of heat packs, such as those dependent upon irreversible chemical reactions, a sodium acetate heat pack can be easily reused by immersing the pack in boiling water for a few minutes, until the crystals are completely dissolved, and allowing the pack to slowly <b>cool</b> <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature.|$|E

5000|$|The {{casserole}} is {{put into}} oven and baked for approximately one hour at 200°C. The cake can be served either still warm directly from the casserole or left to <b>cool</b> <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature. It can be cut into quarters or rectangles and finally sprinkled with powdered sugar.|$|E
40|$|The {{austenitizing}} temperature controls the carbon {{content of the}} austenite which, in turn, influences the structure and properties of cast irons after subsequent <b>cooling</b> <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature. In this paper, for a cast iron with known silicon content, a formula of calculating austenite carbon content at a certain {{austenitizing temperature}} was developed.

50|$|No {{recipes for}} posca {{are known to}} have survived. An {{approximate}} recreation of the beverage can be made by combining 1½ cups of vinegar with ½ cup of honey, 1 tablespoon of crushed coriander seed and 4 cups of water. The mixture should be boiled in a saucepan to dissolve the honey before being allowed to <b>cool</b> <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature. After straining out the coriander seeds, it can be served.|$|E
50|$|The {{americium}} oxalate is {{then added}} to a platinum boat to undergo calcination.The americium oxalate precipitate is dried in a furnace and will begin to decompose at 350 °C. When decomposition begins to occur, the oxalate will turn into the desired black Americium dioxide; to ensure no oxalate remains in the newly forming dioxide, the oven temperature is increased and held at 800 °C then slowly allowed to <b>cool</b> <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature.|$|E
50|$|In {{the cases}} of copper, steel, silver, and brass, this process is {{performed}} by heating the material (generally until glowing) {{for a while and}} then slowly letting it <b>cool</b> <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature in still air. Copper, silver and brass can be cooled slowly in air, or quickly by quenching in water, unlike ferrous metals, such as steel, which must be cooled slowly to anneal. In this fashion, the metal is softened and prepared for further work—such as shaping, stamping, or forming.|$|E
30|$|Hygrothermal treated {{specimens}} {{were prepared}} using an autoclave at 120 or 140  °C for an hour. After the treatment, specimens {{still in the}} autoclave were <b>cooled</b> <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature.|$|R
30|$|Lignosulfonate was {{dispersed}} in DEG at 80  °C for 2  h {{under constant}} stirring. After that the mixture was <b>cooled</b> <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature, then lignosulfonate polyol was finally obtained.|$|R

50|$|While it is {{most easily}} {{prepared}} by simply mixing steamed white rice and yogurt, more elaborate methods can be used when needed. A simple recipe: Rice is steamed so it breaks down into nearly a paste. It is then allowed to <b>cool</b> <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature, after which it is seasoned with finely chopped green chillies, ginger, and curry leaves, and sometimes along with the tadka of urad dal, mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and asafoetida. Finally, milk, yogurt, and salt are added.|$|E
5000|$|In home canning, food {{is packed}} into the jar, leaving some empty [...] "head space" [...] between the level of food {{and the top of}} the jar. The lid is placed on top of the jar with the {{integral}} rubber seal resting on the rim. A band is screwed loosely over the lid, allowing air and steam to escape. The jar is heat sterilized in boiling water or steam and the lid is secured. The jar is then allowed to <b>cool</b> <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature.|$|E
50|$|Rhonditic steels contain about 0.35 to 2.25 percent carbon by weight. They {{are formed}} by mixing a high carbon and low carbon steel, {{such that the}} mixture {{as a whole has}} the desired carbon content. The mixture is then heated to a {{temperature}} at which the high carbon steel will melt, but kept below the melting point of the low carbon steel (~2750 F). The mixture is slightly cooled then maintained for time sufficient for the carbon present to form fullerenes and fullerene chains (approximately 15 minutes), and finally allowed to <b>cool</b> <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature.|$|E

50|$|Sweet tea is tea that is brewed {{very strong}} {{with a large}} amount of sugar added while the tea is still hot. The mixture of sugar and tea is then diluted with water, served over ice and is {{occasionally}} garnished with lemon. Sometimes the diluted mixture is allowed to <b>cool</b> <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature. Other times the sugar and tea mixture is diluted by pouring the hot tea and sugar over a full tumbler of ice to cool it instantly. Sweet tea is traditionally the most common variety of iced tea in the southern United States; elsewhere in the United States, unsweetened iced tea is more common, although there has been a growing trend of offering both sweetened and plain since the early 2000s. Because of the popularity of sweet tea in the south, plain iced tea is often called unsweet tea.|$|E
50|$|These {{limitations}} {{are the reasons}} why large high crown panels such as wings and fenders are often made in many pieces. The pieces are then welded together usually with one of two processes. TIG welding (Tungsten Inert Gas) produces less heat distortion, but produces a harder, more brittle weld that may cause problems when planishing/smoothing by hand, or in the wheeling machine. Oxy-acetylene welding joints don't have this drawback, provided {{they are allowed to}} <b>cool</b> <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature in air, but do produce more heat distortion. Panel joints may be achieved using autogenous welding - that is welding without filler rod (Oxy-acetylene or TIG processes), this is useful when finally smoothing the welding joints as it reduces the amount filing/grinding/linishing needed or almost eliminates it altogether. It also, more importantly, reduces heat distortion of the surface contour, which must be corrected on the wheel or with hammer and dolly.|$|E
5000|$|An {{injection}} molded plastic part {{is considered}} [...] "safe" [...] to remove from its mold {{once it is}} near or below the HDT. This means that part deformation will be held within acceptable limits after removal. The molding of plastics by necessity occurs at high temperatures (routinely 200 °C or higher) due to the low viscosity of plastics in fluid form (this issue can be addressed to some extent {{by the addition of}} plasticizers to the melt). Once plastic is in the mold, it must be cooled to a temperature to which little or no dimensional change will occur after removal. In general, plastics do not conduct heat well and so will take quite a while to <b>cool</b> <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature. One way to mitigate this is to use a cold mold (thereby increasing heat loss from the part). Even so, the cooling of the part to room temperature can limit the mass production of parts.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two types}} of meringue-based buttercream: Italian and Swiss. The meringues must be <b>cooled</b> <b>to</b> <b>room</b> {{temperature}} in order not to melt the butter (which has a variable melting point below [...] ) as it is subsequently beaten in.|$|R
5000|$|It {{has long}} been known that a TRM can be removed if it is heated above the Curie {{temperature}} [...] of the minerals carrying it. A TRM can also be partially demagnetized by heating up to some lower temperature [...] and <b>cooling</b> back <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature. A common procedure in paleomagnetism is stepwise demagnetization, in which the sample is heated to a series of temperatures , <b>cooling</b> <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature and measuring the remaining remanence in between each heating step. The series of remanences can be plotted in a variety of ways, depending on the application.|$|R
50|$|Barium borate {{dihydrate}} {{is prepared}} from {{the solution of}} sodium metaborate and barium chloride at 90-95 °C. After <b>cooling</b> <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature, white powder is precipitated. Barium borate dihydrate loses water at above 140 °C.

50|$|A {{solution}} of 15 g TOPO and 5 mL TOP is heated to 150 °C overnight under nitrogen, removing any water {{that may be}} present in the original TOP solution. This initial TOP solution is vacuum distilled at 0.75 torr, taking the fraction from 204 °C to 235 °C. A TOPSe solution (12.5 mL TOP with 1.579 g TOPSe) is then added and the TOPO/TOP/TOPSe reaction mixture is heated to 278 °C. GaMe3 (0.8 mL) dissolved in 7.5 mL distilled TOP is then injected. After injection, the temperature drops to 254 °C before stabilizing in the range of 266-268 °C after 10 minutes. GaSe nanoparticles then begin to form, and may be detected by a shoulder in the optical absorption spectrum in the 400-450 nm range. After this shoulder is observed, the reaction mixture is left to <b>cool</b> <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature to prevent further reaction. After synthesis and cooling, the reaction vessel is opened and extraction of the GaSe nanoparticle solution is accomplished by addition of methanol. The distribution of nanoparticles between the polar (methanol) and non-polar (TOP) phases depends on experimental conditions. If the mixture is very dry, nanoparticles partition into the methanol phase. If the nanoparticles are exposed to air or water, however, the particles become uncharged and become partitioned into the non-polar TOP phase.|$|E
50|$|Like carbon, lithium {{is also a}} good energy conductor. It's also {{already in}} use in {{commercial}} lithium-ion batteries. Lithium makes a good energy conductor because it allows ions to transfer faster than other elements and is also able to hold on to that energy longer. Research has shown that coating a phosphate particle with a layer of LiFePO4(Lithium iron Phosphate) allows for an even faster rate of ion transferral. Lithium iron phosphate was made by solid-state reaction using Li2CO3(lithium carbonate), FeC2O4(Iron(II) Oxalate), and NH4H2PO4(ammonium dihydrogen phosphate). The compounds were then placed in acetone and ball-milled(grinding materials together in a special cylindrical device) before being heated at 350 °C for 10 hours and then being allowed to <b>cool</b> <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature The mixture was then pelletized under 10,000 pounds of pressure before being heated again at 600 °C for 10 hours under argon. Each nanoball created measured around 50 nm(nanometers) in diameter. Under normal circumstances, electrochemical systems (eg, batteries) can only achieve high power rates with supercapacitors. Supercapacitors achieve a high power rate by storing energy through surface adsorption reactions of charged species on an electrode. However, this results in low energy density. Instead of just storing charge on the surface of a material, Lithium iron phosphate can achieve a high power rate and high energy density by storing charge in the bulk of itself (the interior of the carbon nanoballs). This is possible because lithium iron phosphate has high lithium bulk mobility. Creating a fast ion-conducting surface phase through controlled off-stoichiometry (controlling the mole to mole ratio of the reactants and products in the molecular equation) enabled an ultrafast discharge rate.|$|E
