50|$|On 31 October 2015 <b>Cue</b> <b>Card</b> {{made his}} {{seasonal}} reappearance in the Grade 2 Charlie Hall Chase with his trainer Colin Tizzard reporting he had solved {{the problems with}} a trapped epiglottis of which <b>Cue</b> <b>Card</b> suffered in the previous season, and duly obliged by returning to winning ways first time in almost two years winning by three-quarter lengths from a smart performer in Dynaste. He followed up three weeks later with winning {{the first step of}} the Stayers Chase Triple Crown {{and at the same time}} regaining the Betfair Chase from the last year winner Silviniaco Conti which had set a solid pace but faltered on the run-in with <b>Cue</b> <b>Card</b> finishing 7 lengths in front of him at the line. On Boxing Day 2015 <b>Cue</b> <b>Card</b> continued his improved form of the season and displayed a career best performance to take the King George VI Chase where a strong field was assembled, representing almost all form lines of the early season in staying graded races, including the winner of the Hennessy Gold Cup. <b>Cue</b> <b>Card</b> settled in the middle of the pack for most part of the race and only started to make ground on the front-runner Vautour —one of the leading novice chasers of the last season— in the back straight with the latter setting up a solid pace upfront. The two were left clear by the second last fence at which the favourite Don Cossack fell and an exciting battle began after the last with <b>Cue</b> <b>Card</b> catching Vautour with every stride. The pair finished in a photo finish and <b>Cue</b> <b>Card</b> was soon announced as the winner of the 65th King George VI Chase.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cue</b> <b>Card</b> {{began his}} next {{season in the}} Grade II Haldon Gold Cup at Exeter Racecourse. Competing against more {{experienced}} chasers he started the 5/6 favourite and won impressively by twenty-six lengths. He was then moved up in class and distance for the King George VI Chase at Kempton Park Racecourse on Boxing Day, but after making mistakes at the first two fences he tired in the closing stages and finished fifth behind Long Run. In February, <b>Cue</b> <b>Card</b> won the Grade I Ascot Chase, beating Captain Chris by six lengths: he led {{for most of the}} race and was never in danger of defeat after the runner-up made a [...] "terrible blunder" [...] at the final fence. At the Cheltenham Festival, Tizzard opted to run <b>Cue</b> <b>Card</b> in the two and a half mile Ryanair Chase, rather than taking on Sprinter Sacre in the two mile Queen Mother Champion Chase. Starting at odds of 7/2, <b>Cue</b> <b>Card</b> led from the start and won by nine lengths from the Irish-trained favourite First Lieutenant. On his final appearance of the season, <b>Cue</b> <b>Card</b> finished four and a half lengths second to Sprinter Sacre in the Melling Chase at Aintree.|$|R
40|$|Using the {{techniques}} {{set out in}} the preceding paper (Muller et al., 1987), we investigated the response of place cells to changes in the animal’s environment. The standard apparatus used was a cylinder, 76 cm in diameter, with walls 51 cm high. The interior was uniformly gray except for a white <b>cue</b> <b>card</b> that ran the full height of the wall and occupied 100 ” of arc. The floor of the apparatus presented no obstacles to the animal’s motions. Each of these major features of the apparatus was varied while the others were held constant. One set of manipulations involved the <b>cue</b> <b>card.</b> Rotating the <b>cue</b> <b>card</b> produced equal rotations of the firing fields of single cells.

25|$|A {{teleprompter}} is {{a display}} device that prompts the person speaking {{with an electronic}} visual text of a speech or script. Using a teleprompter {{is similar to the}} practice of using <b>cue</b> <b>cards.</b> The screen is in front of and usually below the lens of the camera, and the words on the screen are reflected to the eyes of the performer using a sheet of clear glass or specially prepared beam splitter. The teleprompter was invented in 1950 by Hubert Schlafly, who was working at 20th Century Fox film studios in Los Angeles.|$|E

40|$|The Respiratory Support Pack (RSP) is {{a medical}} pack onboard the International Space Station (ISS) that {{contains}} much of the necessary equipment for providing aid to a conscious or unconscious crewmember in respiratory distress. Inside the RSP lid pocket is a 5. 5 by 11 inch paper procedural <b>cue</b> <b>card,</b> which is used by a Crew Medical Officer (CMO) {{to set up the}} equipment and deliver oxygen to a crewmember. In training, crewmembers expressed concerns about the readability and usability of the cue card; consequently, updating the <b>cue</b> <b>card</b> was prioritized as an activity to be completed. The Usability Testing and Analysis Facility at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) evaluated the original layout of the <b>cue</b> <b>card,</b> and proposed several new <b>cue</b> <b>card</b> designs based on human factors principles. The approach taken for the assessment was an iterative process. First, in order to completely understand the issues with the RSP <b>cue</b> <b>card,</b> crewmember post training comments regarding the RSP <b>cue</b> <b>card</b> were taken into consideration. Over the course of the iterative process, the procedural information was reorganized into a linear flow after the removal of irrelevant (non-emergency) content. Pictures, color coding, and borders were added to highlight key components in the RSP to aid in quickly identifying those components. There were minimal changes to the actual text content. Three studies were conducted using non-medically trained JSC personnel (total of 34 participants). Non-medically trained personnel participated in order to approximate a scenario of limited CMO exposure to the RSP equipment and training (which can occur six months prior to the mission). In each study, participants were asked to perform two respiratory distress scenarios using one of the <b>cue</b> <b>card</b> designs to simulate resuscitation (using a mannequin along with the hardware). Procedure completion time, errors, and subjective ratings were recorded. The last iteration of the <b>cue</b> <b>card</b> featured a schematic of the RSP, colors, borders, and simplification of the flow of information. The time to complete the RSP procedure was reduced by approximately three minutes with the new design. In an emergency situation, three minutes significantly increases the probability of saving a life. In addition, participants showed the highest preference for this design. The results of the studies and the new design were presented to a focus group of astronauts, flight surgeons, medical trainers, and procedures personnel. The final <b>cue</b> <b>card</b> was presented to a medical control board and approved for flight. The revised RSP <b>cue</b> <b>card</b> is currently onboard ISS...|$|R

The show {{was meant to be}} a reflection of her personality and home life – similar to her reality show but with the inclusion of guest interviews and performances. During the episodes, she conducted some of her interviews on a giant bed. However, the ratings were never successful and critics panned her inability to perform the basic tasks required of a talk show host, such as reading <b>cue</b> <b>cards</b> and conducting interviews.

25|$|Hartnell reprised {{the role}} of the Doctor in Doctor Who during the tenth anniversary story The Three Doctors (1972–73). When Hartnell's wife Heather found out about his planned involvement, she {{informed}} the crew of the show that his failing memory and weakening health prevented him from starring in the special. An agreement was made between the crew and Heather that Hartnell would only be required to sit down during the shoot and read his lines from <b>cue</b> <b>cards.</b> His appearance in this story was his final piece of work as an actor. His health had worsened during the early 1970s, and in December 1974 he was admitted to hospital permanently. In early 1975 he suffered a series of strokes brought on by cerebrovascular disease, and died in his sleep of heart failure on 23 April 1975, at the age of 67. He was cremated and his ashes are buried at the Kent and Sussex Crematorium and Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|Right {{hemisphere}} damage {{can lead}} to aprosodia—the inability to produce or comprehend emotional prosody of language. Emotional prosody is typically conveyed and interpreted through changes in pitch, rhythm, or loudness (Leon et al., 2005). Research thus far has focused primarily on motoric-imitative and cognitive-linguistic approaches to prosody treatment. In a motoric-imitative approach, the client imitates clinician-modeled sentences produced with target emotional prosody. Modeling and cueing is gradually reduced following a six-step hierarchy until the client reaches independent production. In the cognitive-linguistic approach, the client is prompted to produce sentences {{with the support of}} <b>cue</b> <b>cards.</b> Cues include the name of the target emotion, the vocal characteristics of the emotional tone, and a picture of a corresponding facial expression. Again, cues are gradually removed as the client progresses toward independent production. Clinical studies of small groups of participants (four participants; 14 participants.) revealed statistically significant gains in the production of emotional prosody following treatment. Additional research is needed to replicate the results of the limited studies that have been conducted thus far, to evaluate the efficacy of additional treatment approaches, and to compare the relative efficacy of different approaches.|$|E

25|$|The actor {{followed}} The Godfather with Bernardo Bertolucci's 1972 film Last Tango in Paris opposite Maria Schneider, but Brando's highly noted performance {{threatened to}} be overshadowed by an uproar over the sexual {{content of the}} film. Brando portrays a recent American widower named Paul, who begins an anonymous sexual relationship with a young, betrothed Parisian woman named Jeanne. As with previous films, Brando refused to memorize his lines for many scenes; instead, he wrote his lines on <b>cue</b> <b>cards</b> and posted them around the set for easy reference, leaving Bertolucci {{with the problem of}} keeping them out of the picture frame. The film features several intense, graphic scenes involving Brando, including Paul anally raping Jeanne using butter as a lubricant and Paul's angry, emotionally charged final confrontation with the corpse of his dead wife. The controversial movie was a hit, however, and Brando made the list of Top Ten Box Office Stars for the last time. The voting membership of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences again nominated Brando for Best Actor, his seventh nomination. Although Brando won the 1973 New York Film Critics Circle Awards, the actor did not appear at the ceremony or send a representative to pick up the award if he won.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Changes in {{the spatial}} {{arrangement}} or identity of objects inside a familiar environment induce reexploration. The present study looks at modifi-cations of place cell activity during such renewed exploration. Hungry rats foraged for {{food in a}} cylinder with a salient <b>cue</b> <b>card</b> attached {{to the wall and}} with two distinct objects at fixed positions on the floor relative {{to each other and to}} the <b>cue</b> <b>card.</b> Once a set of CA 1 place cells was recorded in this standard configuration, additional sessions were done after two kinds of manipulation. In the first, the two objects were rotated as a rigid set 90 de-grees counterclockwise around the cylinder center while leaving the <b>cue</b> <b>card</b> in place; this was considered a spatial change. The effects of rotating the objects were different for fields near the objects (near fields) and fields far from the objects (far fields). Object rotation altered most near fields in complex ways, including remapping and cessation of firing. Near fields that remained intact after object rotation underwent unpredictable rotations that frequently departed considerably from the expected value of 90 degree...|$|R
