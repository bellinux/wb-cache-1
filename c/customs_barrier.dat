500|$|The Inland Customs Line which {{incorporated}} the Great Hedge of India (or Indian Salt Hedge) was a <b>customs</b> <b>barrier</b> {{built by the}} British across India primarily to collect the salt tax. [...] The customs line was begun while India was {{under the control of}} the East India Company but continued into the period of direct British rule. [...] The line had its beginnings in a series of customs houses that were established in Bengal in 1803 to prevent the smuggling of salt to avoid the tax. [...] These customs houses were eventually formed into a continuous barrier that was brought {{under the control of the}} Inland Customs Department in 1843.|$|E
500|$|The end {{of company}} rule in 1858 allowed the British {{government}} to expand Bengal through territorial acquisitions, updating the line as needed. [...] In 1869 {{the government in}} Calcutta ordered the connection of sections of the line into a continuous <b>customs</b> <b>barrier</b> stretching [...] from the Himalayas to Orissa, near the Bay of Bengal. [...] This distance {{was said to be}} the equivalent of London to Constantinople. [...] The north section from Tarbela to Multan was lightly guarded with posts spread further apart as the wide Indus River was judged to provide a sufficient barrier to smuggling. [...] The more heavily guarded section was around [...] long and began at Multan, running along the rivers Sutlej and Yamuna before terminating south of Burhanpur. [...] The final [...] section reverted to longer distances between customs posts and ran east to Sonapur.|$|E

40|$|Two two-bay {{pultruded}} {{glass fibre}} reinforced polymer (GFRP) post and rail safety barriers have been fabricated. One, a modular barrier, was fabricated from circular cross-section tubes, bolted sheet moulded composite (SMC) two-part multi-way connectors and bases. The other, a <b>custom</b> <b>barrier,</b> was fabricated from three profiles: square cross-section tubular posts, a circular cross-section tubular knee rail and a C-section hand rail. Rivets connected the hand rail to {{the tops of}} the posts and bolted bases connected the posts to the foundation. The continuous knee rail was located by means of holes in the posts’ walls. Both barriers were loaded incrementally up to the general duty load applied to the hand rail and then unloaded. Their load–deformation responses were monitored and both barriers were able to support the general duty load undamaged. After unloading the maximum residual deflection of the hand rail was about 5 mm. The barriers’ mean transverse stiffnesses were evaluated and the <b>custom</b> <b>barrier’s</b> stiffness was about 46 % greater than that of the modular <b>barrier.</b> The <b>custom</b> <b>barrier</b> was re-tested up to the heavy duty load and was able to support the load without visible signs of damage...|$|R

50|$|After a fire {{destroyed}} {{a large part}} of Bingen in 1490, the city authorities tried to raise money to repair the city by levying a market fee. Fees were also collected from Münster-Sarmsheim and other towns in the Palatinate. The citizens of Münster-Sarmsheim logged a complaint, and when this was unsuccessful, they turned to Elector Philip the Righteous. He gave Münster-Sarmsheim the privilege to have its own weekly market.

50|$|During the 18th century, a {{consumer}} revolution led once isolated villages and hamlets outside Paris {{to be swept}} up in a booming material culture. Commodities, and particularly alcohol, consumed outside the <b>customs</b> <b>barrier</b> of the city were considerably cheaper, being exempt from state taxes. This encouraged the growth of an entertainment industry just beyond the taxman's reach and a network of drinking establishments was established. They were especially popular on Sundays and holidays, when Parisians would visit to enjoy themselves and to get drunk cheaply. Today, the term 'guingette' is still used for a waterside refreshment stand, particularly open-air, all over France.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of Europe's new {{political}} landscape {{in the wake of}} the Congress of Vienna in 1814 and 1815, the hitherto flourishing transit trade in Nordhorn was once again disrupted. The border became a <b>customs</b> <b>barrier,</b> stripping Nordhorn of its trading, which had been oriented towards the west. In the years that followed, the town became poorer. Because the Vechte could not be upgraded and modernized, and because it silted up, shipping was disrupted. The townsfolk turned to farming small plots and traders and shippers left town. Only home weaving still afforded some earnings. Whole families emigrated to the New World.|$|E

50|$|The name Gröbenzell {{was first}} {{documented}} in 1725.

Gröbenzell predominantly remained a settlement for peat cutters until World War II. After the war Gröbenzell grew fast, since a lot of refugees moved to Munich and its suburbs. In 1952 the town Gröbenzell was officially founded by merging several districts of Munich, Puchheim, Olching and Geiselbullach to one community.|$|E
50|$|After World War I {{and the end}} of the Zollverein, Luxembourgish {{viticulture}} faced {{a difficult}} situation. Under the Zollverein, Luxembourgish wine producers had been content to produce a maximum quantity of low-quality wine such as Elbling, to be exported to Germany where it would be blended with wines of the Rhine. The establishment of a <b>customs</b> <b>barrier</b> between the two banks of the Moselle disrupted this situation. With the loss of the German market, Luxembourgish viticulture had to adapt itself. The existing grape varieties had to be gotten rid of, to be replaced by varieties that would yield quality wines. Elbling made way for Riesling-Sylbaner, Riesling, Pinot, and Auxerrois. At the same time the vine-growing surface area was substantially reduced, getting rid of the low-quality sites. The surface area went from 1,645 ha in 1914 to 1,000 ha in 1939.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{construction}} of the New Palace of Alban (1831), designed by architect Peter Ghinelli, which gave rise to the present Piazza della Repubblica that went on to form {{the first part of the}} future Corso Garibaldi, the city experienced a number of urban improvements designed to change the face of the city. From {{the construction}} of the Sanzio theater (1845-53) came the final realization of Corso Garibaldi, with a covered walkway on the downhill side to that ensure theater-goers were sheltered from rain and snow on their walk to the Piazza della Repubblica, with construction that lasted until the early part of the twentieth century. In addition, another important change was the destruction, in 1868, of a part of the walls to create a <b>customs</b> <b>barrier,</b> called Porta Nuova or barrier Margherita (in honor of Princess Margaret of Savoy), which was necessitated by a new road that ran along a stretch of the walls and was connected to Corso Garibaldi.

5000|$|Prussia and {{the central}} and southwestern states of Hesse-Nassau and Hesse-Darmstadt, Württemberg, Baden, and Bavaria were leaders in the {{modernization}} of the toll system within the German states. In the Prussian case, {{the experience of the}} Confederation of the Rhine in removing <b>customs</b> <b>barriers</b> offered an example of how it could be done, and Hans, Count von Bülow, who until 1811 had been the Finance Minister in Westphalia, and who had accepted this position in 1813 in Prussia, modeled the Prussian customs statutes on those of the former states of the Confederation. The addition of territory to the existing Prussian state made elimination of <b>customs</b> <b>barriers</b> a powerful factor in Prussian politics. The significant differences between [...] "old" [...] Prussia and the newly acquired territories complicated the debate. The [...] "newer" [...] Prussian provinces in the Rhineland and Westphalia, with their developing manufacturing sectors, contended with the heavily agricultural territories of [...] "old" [...] Prussia. The dissimilarities in the two sides of Prussia confirmed regional perceptions for the need for their own political and administrative units, which became an important element of the customs debate. Within [...] "old" [...] Prussia itself, the customs statutes from 1818 reduced domestic <b>customs</b> <b>barriers.</b> After 1818, goods coming into Prussia and leaving Prussia were charged a high tariff. Goods moved freely within the state itself. The Prussian toll was therefore very simple and efficient. Manufactured goods were heavily taxed, especially textiles, and the most important taxes were for food, necessities and luxury goods.|$|R
