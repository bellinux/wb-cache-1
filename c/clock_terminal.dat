40|$|Current-Voltage (I-V) curve tracers {{are useful}} {{implements}} for solar Photovoltaic (PV) research and manufacturing, particularly when wishing to ascertain module yield viz-a-viz solar irradiation {{falling on the}} module in different climatic conditions. This paper presents a simple affordable and easy to fabricate instrument for tracing I-V characteristics of a PV module. It comprises of rapidly varying resistive loads centred on power resistors connected to relays and controlled by an electronic circuitry. The circuit consists of a 555 astable oscillator {{that is used to}} send clock pulses to the <b>clock</b> <b>terminal</b> of a 4017 decade counter which in turn produces a sequence of pulses. Each progression of pulse advances by one bit to sequentially turn on individual relays via driver transistors. The speed of the count is made variable from the frequency determining network of the 555 oscillator. The I-V characteristics of the module are thus measured by the sequential selection of the relays which are each connected to a selected load resistor to determine the operating point on the I-V curve. The currents and voltages are then recorded simultaneously with irradiance from a pyranometer, by a datalogger to which the instruments are connected. The circuit was tested on two monocrystalline modules to compare the effect of Harmattan dust on PV output yield...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{low power}} divide-by- 8 injection-locked {{frequency}} divider is presented. The frequency divider {{consists of four}} cur-rent-mode logic (CML) D-latches connected {{in the form of}} a four-stage ring with the differential input signal injected into the <b>clock</b> <b>terminals</b> of the latches. The output signals can be taken from the data terminals of any of the four latches. The proposed frequency divider has higher operating frequency and lower power dissipation compared with conventional static frequency dividers. Compared with existing injection-locked frequency dividers, the proposed fully differential frequency divider presents wider locking range with the center frequency independent of in-jection amplitude. The frequency divider is implemented in TSMC 0. 18 m CMOS technology. It consumes around 3. 6 mW power with 1. 8 V supply. The operating frequency can be tuned from 4 GHz to 18 GHz. The ratio of the locking range over the center frequency is up to 50 % depending on the operating frequency and biasing conditions. Index Terms—Divide by eight, injection-locked frequency di-vider, low-power frequency divider. I...|$|R

We report test results on <b>clock</b> accuracy, <b>terminal</b> delay in uplink and downlink under error-free conditions, as well as delay and quality {{in the presence of}} packet losses and network jitter. We discuss how the underlying methodology intended for delay testing can be extended to evaluate de-jitter buffer performance using a black-box approach, and how to model VoLTE packet delay/loss characteristics in a realistic way...|$|R
50|$|The RT-11 {{operating}} {{system could be}} booted from, and perform useful work on, a machine consisting of two 8-inch 250KB floppy disks and 56KB of memory, and could support 8 terminals. Other boot options include the RK05 2.5MB removable hard disk platter, or magnetic tape. Distributions were available pre-installed or on punched tape, magnetic tape, cartridge tape, or floppy disk. A minimal but complete system supporting a single real-time user could run on a single floppy disk and in 8K 16-bit words (16KB) of RAM, including user programs. This was facilitated by support for swapping and overlaying. To realize operation on such small memory system, the keyboard command user interface would be swapped out during the execution of a user's program and then swapped into memory upon program termination. The system supported a real-time <b>clock,</b> printing <b>terminal,</b> VT11 vector graphic unit, 16 channel 100 kHz A/D converter with 2 channel D/A, 9600 baud serial port, 16 bit bidirectional boards, etc.|$|R

40|$|The {{clock signal}} is {{considered}} as the “heartbeat” of a digital system yet jitter {{which is a}} variation on the arrival time of the clock edge, could undermine the overall performance or even cause failures on the system. Deterministic jitter could be reduced during the designing process however random jitter during operation is somehow less-controllable and unavoidable. Being able to remove jitter on the clock would therefore {{play a vital role in}} system performance improvement. This thesis implements a 1 GHz fully feedforward jitter reduction circuit (JRC) which can be used as an on-chip IP core at <b>clock</b> tree <b>terminals</b> to provide a low jitter clock signal to a local clock network or be used at the clock insertion point to reduce jitter from an off chip signal. It can also be stand-alone and used on PCB designs to reduce jitter on the high-frequency clock signal used on the board. This jitter attenuation circuit is implemented using IBM CMHV 7 SF 180 nm MOSFET process, demonstrates a jitter reduction of at least 8 dB at 1 GHz with 33 ps rms Gaussian random jitter (for a 200 ps peak-to-peak randomly changing rising edge input signal) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{test vehicle}} was a 3/10-scale {{model of the}} Miles E.24/43 design except for the {{omission}} of the distinctive annular air intake of the full-scale aircraft. To maintain {{the center of gravity}} (c.g.) it was necessary to include a large balance weight (a!most 1/10 of total all-up weight) in the foremost section of the nose. The layout was further restricted by the need to maintain a constant c.g. position during the consumption of the fuels. This was achieved by placing a small tank ahead of the wing holding one third of the total oxidant (as well as the fuel in the shaped nose tank) and locating the main oxidant tank aft of tile wing. Other large components were placed fore and aft of the wing. In the space below and above the wing centre section were located the air, fuel, oxidant and warm-air pipes, telemetering transmitter, instruments and batteries as well as the autopilot, timing <b>clock,</b> wiring <b>terminal</b> fuses and the connections by which the test vehicle was carried on the parent aircraft. The rear section housed the combustion chamber, radar transponder, smoke-producing fluid, instruments and oscillators for combustion chamber pressure and tailplane angle, servos and dive mechanism for the tailplane which together with the fixed directional fin were fitted to the lower body prior. The single-piece wing was of mahogany with Dural inserts at the leading and trailing edges; it was of biconvex section and of tapered planform with an unswept half-chord line. The Dural inserts formed a convenient dipole-aerial system for the telemetering unit. (A similar arrangement on the tailplane served the radar transponder.) ...|$|R
40|$|The MIL-STD- 188 - 110 A Single Tone high {{frequency}} modem {{is used by}} the United States military everyday as a beyond line-of-sight radio. Typically, beyond line-of-sight military radios use satellites for reflection. Satellite time is in high demand, and since there are a finite number of satellites in orbit, it makes over-the-air time expensive. The Single Tone {{high frequency}} modem offers a reliable alternative by using the ionosphere, rather than a satellite, for reflection. The ionosphere adds unique channel effects, causing the signal processing software to be more complex and harder to debug than radios which use satellites. Before being placed into production, the MIL-STD- 188 - 110 A Single Tone high frequency modem is placed under comprehensive performance tests. These tests are meant to fully verify all aspects of the software and to impose all possible channel effects such as additive white Gaussian noise, doppler shift, <b>terminal</b> <b>clock</b> differences, frequency and time dispersion. When a test fails, debugging the software can be tedious and time consuming. The two major steps to quick and successful debugging are understanding and isolation. The engineer must understand the channel model and receive path in order to correlate a test failure with a specific section of software. After the channel model and receive path are understood, timing patterns of bit errors and test failures caused by individual channel effects help the engineer isolate the software defect. This thesis compiles the necessary information to understand a generalized receive path and provides a framework for isolating a software defect...|$|R
50|$|The SWCC clock's {{were usually}} used in {{synchronized}} time systems. Time systems {{that consisted of}} many clocks linked electrically to a master clock. The majority of the systems were installed in businesses, factories, banks, schools, and universities. Many railroads also relied on SWCC synchronized clock systems. Some clocks were sold as individual timepieces but most clocks {{were a part of}} time systems. SWCC offered many very elegant designs for their clocks and the clocks could be purchased to match any decor. These were essentially catalog items. There were however many special one-of-a-kind clocks and clock systems that were installed by SWCC. These were intended to be very important architectural statements. Two of the most significant installations were the clocks in the Grand Central Terminal and the enormous four-dial clock and lighting system for the Metropolitan Life Insurance building. The two pictured clocks of the Grand Central Terminal and the outside clocks on the Metropolitan Life Insurance building were just part of each property's very complex synchronized time systems. Grand Central Terminal had a master clock that controlled all the <b>clocks</b> at the <b>terminal.</b> Metropolitan Life had two separate master clocks. One controlled the motors for the four outside clocks, rang the bells in the bell tower and controlled the spectacular and very complex outside lighting system. Another SWCC master clock controlled 184 slave clocks throughout the original building. Complex SWCC synchronized systems were also installed in the London Underground. The underground installation started in 1905 and eventually included about 600 SWCC clocks.|$|R
