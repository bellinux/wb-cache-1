5|$|When Fortress mode is selected, {{the player}} {{is given the}} option to choose the embark {{location}} in the world. The player <b>can</b> <b>consider</b> the environment, elevations, biome, soil types and mineral concentrations which can pose significant challenges to the development or survival of the fortress. Customizing the colony's supplies, domestic animals and skills are available, but each dwarf's mental and physical attributes are randomly generated. The game describes in detail each dwarf's physical appearance, like hair and facial features. The mental abilities, individual preferences and desires are also randomly generated. Each dwarf's relationships with others and the deities they worship can be viewed.|$|E
5|$|Apollonius' {{problem can}} be {{extended}} from the plane to the sphere and other quadratic surfaces. For the sphere, the problem is to construct all the circles (the boundaries of spherical caps) that are tangent to three given circles on the sphere. This spherical {{problem can be}} rendered into a corresponding planar problem using stereographic projection. Once the solutions to the planar problem have been constructed, the corresponding solutions to the spherical problem can be determined by inverting the stereographic projection. Even more generally, one <b>can</b> <b>consider</b> the problem of four tangent curves that result from the intersections of an arbitrary quadratic surface and four planes, a problem first considered by Charles Dupin.|$|E
5|$|DayZ {{attempts}} to portray a realistic scenario within the gameplay, {{with the environment}} having different effects on the player. A character may receive bone fractures from damage to their legs, go into shock from bullet wounds or zombie bites, receive infections from zombies or diseased players, or faint due to low blood pressure. Thirst and hunger must be kept under control by finding sustenance in either cities or the wilderness, with body temperature playing a key part in the character's survival. The game focuses on surviving and the human elements of a zombie apocalypse by forcing the player to acknowledge basic human needs like thirst, hunger and shelter. These mechanics require the player to focus on immediate goals before they <b>can</b> <b>consider</b> long-term strategies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} confluence operators, that {{are inspired by}} the existing links between belief revision, update and merging operators. Roughly, update operators <b>can</b> be <b>considered</b> as pointwise revision, whereas revision operators <b>can</b> be <b>considered</b> as special case of merging operators. Confluence operators are to merging operators what update operators are to revision operators. Similarly, update operators <b>can</b> be <b>considered</b> as special case of confluence operators just as revision <b>can</b> be <b>considered</b> as special case of merging operators. Confluence operators gives all possible agreement situations from a set of belief bases...|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} {{superstring}} revolution in 1984, many physicists turned to string theory {{as a unified}} theory of particle physics and quantum gravity. Unlike supergravity theory, string theory was able to accommodate the chirality of the standard model, and it provided a theory of gravity consistent with quantum effects. Another feature of string theory that many physicists were drawn to in the 1980s and 1990s was its high degree of uniqueness. In ordinary particle theories, one <b>can</b> <b>consider</b> any collection of elementary particles whose classical behavior is described by an arbitrary Lagrangian. In string theory, the possibilities are much more constrained: by the 1990s, physicists had argued that there were only five consistent supersymmetric versions of the theory.|$|E
5|$|The AdS/CFT {{correspondence}} resolves {{the black}} hole information paradox, {{at least to some}} extent, because it shows how a black hole can evolve {{in a manner consistent with}} quantum mechanics in some contexts. Indeed, one <b>can</b> <b>consider</b> black holes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and any such black hole corresponds to a configuration of particles on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space. These particles obey the usual rules of quantum mechanics and in particular evolve in a unitary fashion, so {{the black hole}} must also evolve in a unitary fashion, respecting the principles of quantum mechanics. In 2005, Hawking announced that the paradox had been settled in favor of information conservation by the AdS/CFT correspondence, and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which black holes might preserve information.|$|E
5|$|To {{amend the}} Constitution, {{one of two}} things must happen before the National Assembly <b>can</b> <b>consider</b> the measure: The {{president}} must suggest the change, or 150,000 eligible voters must send a petition to the National Assembly. Both chambers of the National Assembly must discuss the proposed amendments for a minimum of three months. Two conditions can prevent a discussion from taking place: Either there is a state of emergency, or there are less than six months in the current term of the House of Representatives. In order for an amendment to take effect, it must be approved by either two-thirds of both chambers of the National Assembly or a simple majority of the voting population of Belarus in a national referendum. The only restriction is that Sections One, Two, Four and Eight can only be changed by national referendum. Rules for conducting a national referendum are enumerated in Chapters 22 through 25 of the Electoral Code of the Republic of Belarus. Since the original adoption of the Constitution in 1994, it has been amended twice; once in 1996 and once in 2004.|$|E

5|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{matrices}} whose entries are real or complex numbers. However, matrices can be considered with much more general types of entries than real or complex numbers. As a first step of generalization, any field, that is, a set where addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations are defined and well-behaved, may be used instead of R or C, for example rational numbers or finite fields. For example, coding theory makes use of matrices over finite fields. Wherever eigenvalues are considered, as these are roots of a polynomial they may exist only in a larger field {{than that of the}} entries of the matrix; for instance they may be complex in case of a matrix with real entries. The possibility to reinterpret the entries of a matrix as elements of a larger field (for example, to view a real matrix as a complex matrix whose entries happen to be all real) then allows considering each square matrix to possess a full set of eigenvalues. Alternatively one <b>can</b> <b>consider</b> only matrices with entries in an algebraically closed field, such as C, from the outset.|$|E

Because Gestalt therapy relies on the contact between therapist and client, and because a relationship <b>can</b> be <b>considered</b> to be contact over time, Gestalt therapy <b>can</b> be <b>considered</b> a relational or interpersonal approach. Because Gestalt therapy appreciates the larger picture which is the complex situation involving multiple influences in a complex situation, it <b>can</b> be <b>considered</b> a multi-systemic approach. Because the processes of Gestalt therapy are experimental, involving action, Gestalt therapy <b>can</b> be <b>considered</b> both a paradoxical and an experiential/experimental approach.|$|R
