5|$|Bordallo reintroduced it, as amended, at the {{beginning}} of the next Congress. It gained 30 cosponsors, bypassed the <b>committee</b> <b>stage</b> and was passed by voice vote in March 2009. Kerry reintroduced it in the Senate a month later; it eventually gained 33 cosponsors there. The Senate Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries and Coast Guard held hearings on the bill in June.|$|E
5|$|A {{statement}} in the House of Lords on 13 May 1959 promised further reform, and a detailed White Paper was published in December. In November 1960 a Bill based on that report {{was introduced in the}} House of Lords, where it was much scrutinised by solicitors and barristers (particularly at the <b>Committee</b> <b>stage)</b> owing to its complexity. The Bill received its royal assent on 3 August 1961, and passed into law as the Trustee Investments Act 1961.|$|E
5000|$|At the <b>committee</b> <b>stages</b> of the Cowbridge Railway Bill, the South Wales Railway {{once again}} put forward the {{proposal}} that the branch should {{be built on}} the broad gauge, which would bring it into the [...] "associated companies" [...] of the broad gauge group. However this last-minute idea was not taken forward.|$|R
50|$|In July 2008, {{volunteers from}} the Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (MANS)(Maharashtra Blind faith Eradication <b>Committee)</b> <b>staged</b> a protest in Mumbai to draw {{attention}} to the bill, where the protesters slapped themselves. They claimed that it was to remind themselves that, they had elected the wrong representatives who were not interested in the people's welfare.|$|R
50|$|Administration of the Society is the {{responsibility}} of a Council. The Council also provides technical evidence on topics relating to animal behaviour and animal welfare during the <b>committee</b> <b>stages</b> of government legislation, for example, by discussion with groups such as the UK’s Farm Animal Welfare Council. The European Parliament and the Council of Europe also consult council on such matters.|$|R
5|$|The {{political}} and popular pressure for reform {{had grown so}} great that pro-reform Whigs won an overwhelming House of Commons majority {{in the general election}} of 1831. The Whig party won almost all constituencies with genuine electorates, leaving the Tories with little more than the rotten boroughs. The Reform Bill was again brought before the House of Commons, which agreed to the second reading by a large majority in July. During the <b>committee</b> <b>stage,</b> opponents of the bill slowed its progress through tedious discussions of its details, but it was finally passed in September, by a margin of more than 100 votes.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March, {{the vote}} on the second reading {{attracted}} a record 608 members, including the non-voting Speaker (the previous record was 530 members). Despite the high attendance, the second reading was approved by only one vote, and further progress on the Reform Bill was difficult. During the <b>committee</b> <b>stage,</b> Isaac Gascoyne put forward a motion objecting to provisions of the bill that reduced {{the total number of}} seats in the House of Commons. This motion was carried, against the government's wishes, by 8 votes. Thereafter, the ministry lost a vote on a procedural motion by 22 votes. As these divisions indicated that Parliament was against the Reform Bill, the ministry decided to request a dissolution and take its appeal to the people.|$|E
5|$|The bill then {{proceeds}} to the <b>committee</b> <b>stage,</b> where {{the details of}} the drafting of the proposed law are examined. Where a bill is relatively uncontroversial, it is referred to a committee of the whole Parliament; in other words, all the MPs attending the sitting form a committee and discuss the bill clause by clause. Bills that are more controversial, or that require the views of interested groups or the public, are often referred to a select committee. This is a committee of selected MPs who invite interested people to make representations to the committee. Public hearings to hear submissions on the bill may be held. The select committee then reports its findings, together with any suggested amendments to the bill, to Parliament.|$|E
50|$|If the inquiry's, or counsel's, {{recommendation}} is positive then the Secretary of State makes a provisional order. This order has no effect, however, until confirmed by an order confirmation act passed by Parliament. The bill {{for such an}} act normally skips the second reading and <b>committee</b> <b>stages</b> of the parliamentary process (as this {{has been replaced by}} the inquiry) and so takes up less time.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{deceased}} by {{the time}} of the Restoration, the regicides John Bradshaw, Oliver Cromwell, Henry Ireton and Thomas Pride were served with a bill of attainder on 15 May 1660 backdated to 1 January 1649 (NS). After the <b>committee</b> <b>stages,</b> the bill passed both the Houses of Lords and Commons and was engrossed on 4 December 1660. This was followed with a resolution that passed both Houses on the same day: ...|$|R
50|$|In August 2007, China’s Olympic <b>Committee</b> <b>staged</b> {{the one-year}} {{countdown}} celebration to the Olympics, featuring 100 of China’s top singers on Tiananmen Square, singing the official Olympics countdown song called, ‘We Are Ready’, Meilin {{was the only}} foreigner {{invited to participate in}} this event, which was broadcast worldwide on China Central Television.She was also featured in the official printed book commemorating this song and event, with a full-page photo and her signature.|$|R
5|$|Industrialist Joseph Wharton had a near-monopoly on {{the mining}} of nickel in the United States, {{and sought to}} promote its use in coinage. He was also highly {{influential}} in Congress. His friends there, though they had failed to obtain the metal's use for the two-cent piece, had been more successful with the base-metal three-cent coin. Pollock prepared a bill authorizing a five-cent coin of the same alloy as the three-cent piece, with a total weight not to exceed 60 grains (3.9 g). At the <b>committee</b> <b>stage</b> in the House of Representatives, the weight was amended to , ostensibly to make the weight equal to five grams in the metric system but more likely so that Wharton could sell more nickel. This made the new coin heavy, in terms of weight per $.01 of face value, compared to the three-cent copper-nickel coin. The bill passed without debate on May 16, 1866. The new copper-nickel coin was legal tender for up to one dollar and would be paid out by the Treasury in exchange for coin of the United States, excluding the half cent, cent and two-cent. It was redeemable in lots of $100 for banknotes. Fractional currency in denominations of less than ten cents was withdrawn.|$|E
25|$|During the <b>Committee</b> <b>Stage</b> {{debate in}} the Seanad on the Civil Partnership Bill 2009, Mullen and Senator Feargal Quinn tabled 77 {{amendments}}. Mullen spoke at length on amendments dealing with freedom of conscience in what Government Senators claimed {{was an attempt to}} obstruct the Bill. For {{the first time in two}} decades the Cathaoirleach then closed the <b>committee</b> <b>stage</b> debate, after less than ten hours of discussion.|$|E
25|$|The {{bill was}} {{then sent to}} Seanad Éireann, where it passed the Second Stage and <b>Committee</b> <b>Stage</b> on 1 May 2008, and the Report and Final Stages on 9 May 2008.|$|E
50|$|The Miss Bahamas <b>Committee</b> <b>staged</b> the Miss Bahamas pageant for 40 years. In 2002, the {{franchise}} for the Miss Universe pageant {{was awarded to}} Theophilus Fritz and Gaynell Rolle who ran the pageant until 2009. In 2010, the Miss Bahamas Organization (MBO) headed by journalist Michelle Malcolm was awarded {{the franchise}} for Miss Universe. At the time, MBO - which was formed in 2006 - was already producing the Miss World Bahamas pageant since the year 2007.|$|R
50|$|The bill {{returned}} to the Equal Opportunities <b>Committee</b> for <b>Stage</b> 2. The <b>Committee</b> considered the bill on 19 December 2013, rejecting several amendments proposed by opponents of the legislation. The <b>Committee</b> continued <b>Stage</b> 2 on 16 January 2014. The final Stage 3 debate and vote was held on 4 February 2014. The bill was approved with 105 MSPs in favour and 18 opposed, with no abstentions. The bill received Royal Assent on 12 March 2014 and the first same-sex marriages occurred on 16 December 2014, for partners in a civil partnership who converted into marriage.|$|R
50|$|Most African-American {{newspapers}} supported {{participation in}} the Olympics. The Philadelphia Tribune and the Chicago Defender both agreed that black victories would undermine Nazi views of Aryan supremacy and spark renewed African-American pride. American Jewish organizations, meanwhile, largely opposed the Olympics. The American Jewish Congress and the Jewish Labor <b>Committee</b> <b>staged</b> rallies and supported the boycott of German goods to show their disdain for American participation. The JLC organized the World Labor Athletic Carnival, held on August 15 and 16 at New York’s Randall’s Island, to protest the holding of the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany.|$|R
25|$|In Dáil Éireann, {{the bill}} passed the First Stage on 2 April 2008, the Second Stage on 23 April 2008, and the <b>Committee</b> <b>Stage</b> and Report and Final Stages on 29 April 2008; {{the text of the}} {{referendum}} was also approved on 29 April.|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} the 1845 Bill {{submission}} was that the preamble was proved but that the <b>Committee</b> <b>stage</b> in the House of Lords rejected the Bill: {{this meant that the}} desirability of the line was accepted, but that the detail of Moorsom's design was considered unsafe.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, Labour MP John Golding {{talked for}} over 11 hours during an all-night {{sitting at the}} <b>committee</b> <b>stage</b> of the British Telecommunications Bill. However, as this was at a {{standing}} committee {{and not in the}} Commons chamber, he was also able to take breaks to eat.|$|E
50|$|Salvia divinorum remains {{legal in}} some {{countries}} and, within the United States, it is legal in some states. However, there have been calls for its prohibition. While not currently regulated by US federal drug laws, several states have passed laws criminalizing the substance. Some proposed state bills have failed to progress and have not been made into law, with motions having been voted down or otherwise dying in <b>committee</b> <b>stages.</b> There have not been many publicized prosecutions of individuals violating anti-salvia laws in the few jurisdictions {{in which it is}} prohibited.|$|R
2500|$|Following a {{consultation}} period, {{in which the}} government received many submissions, the majority of which asked that the bill be strengthened, a revised bill was published; the main alteration was that the guidance of the [...] is now statutory (rather than advisory). In the <b>committee</b> <b>stages</b> in the Scottish Parliament, there was much debate over whether Gaelic should be given 'equal validity' with English. Due to executive concerns about resourcing implications if this wording was used, the Education Committee settled on the concept of 'equal respect'. It is not clear what the legal force of this wording is.|$|R
50|$|Most legislatures {{have their}} powers {{restricted}} by the nation's Constitution, and Montesquieu's {{theory of the}} separation of powers typically restricts a legislature's powers to legislation. Although the legislature has the power to legislate, it is the courts who have the power to interpret statutes, treaties and regulations. Similarly, although parliaments have the power to legislate, it is usually the executive who decides on the legislative programme. The procedure is usually that a bill is introduced to Parliament, and after the required number of readings, <b>committee</b> <b>stages</b> and amendments, the bill gains approval and becomes an Act.|$|R
25|$|The {{first two}} {{amendments}} were declared {{as out of}} order under Standing Order 298(1); {{the other two were}} voted down by the House (SOP 202 by 22 votes to 88, SOP 203 by 36 votes to 80). The bill passed the <b>committee</b> <b>stage</b> 77 votes to 43 – the same as the second reading with the exception that Gerry Brownlee (National) did not vote and could not cast a proxy vote.|$|E
25|$|The Legislative Council (Amendment) Bill 2012, if passed, amends the Legislative Council Ordinance to {{restrict}} the right to stand in Legislative Council by-elections in geographical constituencies and the District Council (Second) functional constituency. In addition to those persons who are mentally disabled, bankrupt, or imprisoned, members who resign their seats {{will not have the}} right to stand for six months' time from their resignation. The bill is currently passing through the <b>committee</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{bill was}} {{examined}} in 13 sittings by the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill Committee, a public bill committee established to scrutinise the bill line by line. The bill completed its <b>committee</b> <b>stage</b> on 12 March 2013 and had its report {{stage in the}} House of Commons on 20–21 May 2013. The third reading took place on 21 May, and was approved by 366 votes to 161, with the bill receiving its first reading in the House of Lords the same evening.|$|E

40|$|This Paper {{concerns}} the Energy Bill, which starts its <b>Committee</b> <b>stages</b> in the Lords on Monday 7 th September and Wednesday 9 th September 2015. The Bill is mainly tasked {{to create the}} OGA (Oil and Gas Authority). In addition the Bill creates responsibilities for the OGA regarding Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) licensing. Most importantly, the Bill raises {{the opportunity for a}} discussion of how the envisaged development of CCS will be paid for. At present, the funding model involves significant taxpayer support through the CCS competition and levy control framework on electricity. We make a simple proposal that would remove this burden of Government support, and spread the cost of CCS development and deployment across the entire fossil fuel sector through a Certificate scheme that would rely only on data already reported to Government and the OGA, thus minimising the costs of compliance.

25|$|On 22 December 2014, a {{proposed}} {{amendment to the}} Civil Code which would legalize same-sex marriage was due to go under review by the Judiciary Committee. If the amendment passes the <b>committee</b> <b>stage</b> it will then be voted on at the plenary session of the Legislative Yuan in 2015. The amendment, called the marriage equality amendment, would insert neutral terms into the Civil Code replacing ones that imply heterosexual marriage, effectively legalizing same-sex marriage. It would also allow same-sex couples to adopt children.|$|E
25|$|If no model {{gained a}} majority, a second run-off {{referendum}} would be held.

25|$|Following the <b>committee</b> <b>stage,</b> {{the bill}} goes through its third reading. During this stage the {{principles}} behind the bill {{can no longer}} be questioned, and only minor amendments will be allowed. The bill is then voted upon. In most cases, a simple majority of all the MPs present and voting is all that is needed for the bill to be approved. However, bills seeking to amend the Constitution must be carried by a special majority: not less than two-thirds of all MPs on the second and third readings.|$|E
40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: Penile {{cancer is}} rare. Thus, {{predicting}} cancer specific mortality may be difficult. We devised an accurate and yet easily applicable predictive rule that compares favorably with 2 previous models (73. 8 % and 74. 7 % accuracy, respectively). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified patients treated with primary tumor excision for {{all stages of}} penile squamous cell carcinoma between 1998 and 2006. Disease stage definitions using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results <b>stage,</b> American Joint <b>Committee</b> on Cancer <b>stage</b> and TNM classification, and tumor grade were used to predict cancer specific mortality. Predictive accuracy estimates were compared using the DeLong method for related AUCs. RESULTS: Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results stage alone (1 predictor variable) was least accurate (74. 5 %). American Joint <b>Committee</b> on Cancer <b>stage</b> with tumor grade (2 predictor variables) was the most simple and most accurate (80. 9 %, p < 0. 001). A benefit {{similar to that of}} American Joint <b>Committee</b> on Cancer <b>stage</b> with tumor grade was seen for TNM classification and TG (80. 7 %, p = 0. 8). However, this rule (4 predictor variables) was more complex than American Joint <b>Committee</b> on Cancer <b>stage</b> and tumor grade. CONCLUSIONS: American Joint <b>Committee</b> on Cancer <b>stage</b> combined with tumor grade is the simplest, most accurate cancer specific mortality prediction rule after primary tumor excision for penile squamous cell carcinoma. This method is also more accurate than 2 previous cancer specific mortality prediction rules...|$|R
