5|$|Bond <b>chooses</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> take Smythe {{into custody}} immediately, but leaves him to {{contemplate}} his options – suicide or a court martial. As Smythe hunts for scorpion fish to feed Octopussy, he suffers a sting which triggers a fatal heart attack, during which Octopussy pulls him under. Deciding to spare Smythe's reputation, Bond classifies the death as an accidental drowning.|$|E
5|$|Ra's loads the {{microwave}} emitter onto Gotham's monorail system, intending {{to release the}} drug as the train travels toward the city's central water source. Batman rescues Rachel from a drugged mob and indirectly reveals his identity to her. He pursues Ra's onto the monorail and fights him just as Gordon uses the Tumbler's cannons to destroy {{a section of the}} track. Batman refuses to kill Ra's, but also <b>chooses</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> save him, gliding from the train and leaving Ra's aboard as it crashes and explodes, killing him.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{qualitative}} study that explores {{the experiences of}} Latin as <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have children. Research supports that women <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have children experience cultural expectations and negative social feedback regarding their decision. Given the research findings regarding the experiences {{of women in the}} general population who <b>choose</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have children, the researcher was curious about the culture-specific themes that might be identified that are relevant to the experience of being a female <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have children in the Latino culture. A qualitative, phenomenological approach was selected and 10 Latina participants from Central America were interviewed about their experiences with <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have children. Four broad themes were identified: participants 2 ̆ 7 perspectives regarding their decision process <b>to</b> <b>not</b> have children, factors influencing their decision, social interactions experienced regarding their decision, and their sense of identity as women and Latinas <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have children. The findings suggest that interpersonal approaches toward understanding gender do not take into account complex gender identities that include non-traditional traits and behaviors, such as <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have children. The results also suggest that the Latina 2 ̆ 7 s decision process in <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have children is a multidimensional process involving cultural, interpersonal, and intrapersonal factors that may occur concurrently and vary with time and situation. In addition, the findings suggest that despite cultural expectations, negative social interactions, and complex intrapersonal process, Latinas <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have children are able to continue with their decision through the help of social support and perseverance. It is not clear that there are culture-specific themes describing the Latina 2 ̆ 7 s experience with <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have children. It is suggested that these findings have implications for all women choosing non-traditional lifestyles, such as <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have children. Further research implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research were discussed...|$|R

5|$|The white Schnauzer {{is one of}} four color {{varieties}} of the Miniature Schnauzer currently recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. However, they are not accepted for conformation showing by the American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club. The controversy rests on the disputed origins of the white variation: whether it was contained within the genes of the originally recognized breed, or whether it was the result of subsequent modifications. Since the other two Schnauzer types have never been available in a white variation, and the original German standard never included white as an acceptable color, the AMSC <b>chooses</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> recognize white.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the year, {{the boys}} must pass seven final exams to graduate. Anmar, Hyder and Ali each fail two subjects, and are given the option to retake the exams.

Hyder also retakes his exams and passes, but his family {{can no longer afford to}} pay for the university fees. Ali <b>chooses</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> retake the exams, and his family leave Iraq. Mohammad fails four subjects and must repeat his senior year. He chooses to do so at a different school while working at his uncle's scooter repair shop. As the documentary closes, it notes that during the year of filming, two of the boys' classmates were killed, six were kidnapped, and seventy-five left Iraq.|$|E

5|$|Ear {{piercing}} {{has been}} practiced {{all over the}} world since ancient times. There is considerable written and archaeological evidence of the practice. Mummified bodies with pierced ears have been discovered, including the oldest mummified body discovered to date, the 5,300-year-old Ötzi the Iceman, which was found in a glacier in Italy. This mummy had an ear piercing 7–11mm diameter. The oldest earrings found in a grave date to 2500 BCE. These were located in the Sumerian city of Ur, home of the Biblical patriarch Abraham. Earrings are mentioned in the Bible. In Genesis 35:4, Jacob buries the earrings worn by members of his household along with their idols. In Exodus 32, Aaron makes the golden calf from melted earrings. Deuteronomy 15:12–17 dictates ear piercing for a slave who <b>chooses</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be freed. Earrings are also referenced in connection to the Hindu goddess Lakshmi in the Vedas. Earrings for pierced ears were found in a grave in the Ukok region between Russia and China dated between 400 and 300 BCE.|$|E

5|$|Realizing {{he needs}} allies, Batman works with Gordon {{and the police}} to retake the prison. Sitting at the {{electric}} chair, the Joker offers Batman a choice: kill Bane, or allow Bane's heartbeat to charge the chair and kill the Joker. Batman uses the electric gloves to stop Bane's heart. Satisfied, the Joker leaves, intending to detonate bombs placed around the city. Batman revives Bane, who injects himself with a steroid that transforms him into a hulking beast. He loses the ensuing battle to Batman and suffers amnesia as a side effect from the steroid, thus preserving Batman's secret identity. With Gordon's help, Batman locates the Joker in the prison chapel. Dismayed that Bane is still alive, the Joker tries to goad Batman into killing him but Batman subdues him instead. Gordon <b>chooses</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> pursue Batman, believing he can help the city.

5|$|While {{willing to}} accept his death and allow Momohime her {{remaining}} time in her body, Kongiku shows them another way to Heaven. There, Yukinojo appears and reveals {{that he had the}} Dark Resurrection all along. They are then attacked by Fudo-Myoou, who is there to deliver divine justice upon Jinkuro. In the first ending, Jinkuro allows himself to be sent to Yomi while Momohime lives; she decides to forgo her marriage to Yukinojo and become a Buddhist nun in the hope of saving Jinkuro's soul through prayer. In the second ending, Momohime and Jinkuro are intercepted by Kisuke and Yuzuruha, resulting in Kongiku being robbed of her human form as punishment for her defiance. Though defeated, Kisuke delivers a fatal wound to Momohime, forcing Jinkuro to merge his soul with Momohime's to save her: this act leaves her an amnesiac but grants her Jinkuro's sword fighting abilities, which become legendary as she travels Japan in search of her missing memories. In the third ending, after the battle with Fudo-Myoou Jinkuro is transported to the night he first attacked Yukinojo and Momohime with the power of the Oboro Muramasa Demon Blade, which can defy the passage of fate.
