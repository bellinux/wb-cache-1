The court is now under the duty of active case management to encourage and promote {{the use of an}} alternative dispute resolution procedure where appropriate. Facilitative mediation was generally practised in Hong Kong before the Civil Justice Reform. By issuing a specific practice direction on mediation, the judiciary has given a strong boost for this process to the extent that parties may even be penalized in costs if they unreasonably refuse to mediate. The continuous transfer of conflict resolution from the hands of the judge to the parties gives rise to an increasing risk that information disclosed in mediation may be used to the parties' disadvantage in subsequent legal proceedings. This paper examines the precise scope of three common law principles that protect <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> <b>mediation</b> communications. Drawing upon the approaches of local institutions, the US Uniform Mediation Act and the EU Mediation Directive, it considers the arguments that might be relevant in deciding what law should govern the issues at present not covered by the existing legal framework, a question that has become more pressing {{in view of the fact}} that negotiations have begun on a proposed mediation ordinance to deal with it. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

Mediation erlaubt es den Parteien deren Streitigkeiten eigenverantwortlich, schnell, kostengünstig und flexibel zu lösen. Was ist nun aber zu beachten, wenn man ein Mediationsverfahren einleiten möchte oder eine Mediationsklausel in ein Vertragsdokument inkludiert wird? Gibt es gesetzliche Regeln die beachtet werden müssen? Kann man auf Verfahrensregeln zurückgreifen? Wo findet man einen qualifizierten Mediator? Kann man eine Mediationsvereinbarung oder das Ergebnis einer Mediation vollstrecken? Diese und viele andere Fragen werden sich Parteien einer Mediation stellen. Die vorliegende Arbeit beschäftigt sich unter Kapitel 2 mit allgemeinen Fragen, die sich Parteien, Parteienvertreter und Mediatoren vor, während und nach der Mediation stellen sollten. In Kapitel 3 wirft die Autorin einen Blick auf die in Österreich gültigen gesetzlichen Regelungen sowie die Richtlinie der Europäischen Union, welche im Mai 2011 in Kraft tritt. Darüber hinaus wirft die Autorin unter Kapitel 5 einen kritischen Blick auf die Verfahrensregeln über Mediation von Organisationen wie UNCITRAL, ICC, LCIA, SCCAM, VIAC, CEDR oder MEDAL. Anhand von 14 wesentlichen Fragestellungen vergleicht und untersucht die Autorin die unterschiedlichen Verfahrensregeln. Not only multinational companies {{but also}} states and international organisations {{have recognized the}} value of methods for settling commercial disputes through involvement of a third neutral person assisting them {{in their attempt to}} settle their dispute amicably. Mediation proceedings permit the parties to seek a high quality amicable solution to their disputes using a minimum of time and resources. They are intended to be party-controlled, rapid, inexpensive and flexible. Although the process should be as flexible as possible, parties often find it helpful to refer to a procedural framework provided by a set of established rules, like the UNCITRAL, ICC, LCIA, SCCAM, VIAC, CEDR or MEDAL mediation procedure, to bring shape and discipline to the process. Institutional mediation rules refer to the entire mediation process from the initiation until the termination. Apart from institutional rules, which are not part of a national legislation, mediation is often not subject to any domestic procedural law. Especially in Europe, yet, few national laws on mediation exist. This situation will change within the next years. The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have enacted the Directive 2008 / 52 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2008 on certain aspects of mediation in civil and commercial matters. According to the Mediation Directive, all Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations, and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Mediation Directive before 21 May 2011. Therefore, Member States are now required to deal with the question of whether its legal system reflects the content of the Mediation Directive. Members of the European Union must in particular adopt procedures to enforce mediation settlement agreements, protect the <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> <b>mediation</b> communications, provide for regulations on suspension of limitation periods and promote training of mediators under the Mediation Directive. The Mediation Directive is intended to increase access to justice by providing an additional mechanism for resolving disputes. Even though there are considerable efforts underway to make mediation more popular within the environment of international dispute settlement, there {{is still a long way}} to go to. This thesis first deals with the question which basic considerations, should be borne in mind when deciding about the method of resolving disputes. Such basic considerations include amongst others the choice between different dispute settlement methods, timing, professional assistance, persons involved in the dispute settlement process, rules of procedure and enforcement of a settlement agreement (section 2). Secondly, this paper follows the development of statutory and institutional mediation rules for international dispute settlement. It offers insights into the provisions of the Austrian Act on Mediation in Civil Matters, the Mediation Directive and discusses the provisions of the Mediation Act in light of the requirements of the Mediation Directive (section 3). Thirdly, it describes several institutional rules including those of UNCITRAL, ICC, LCIA, SCCAM, VIAC, CEDR and MEDAL presenting in an analytical and clear manner the relations and differences behind these mediation provisions (section 4). ...|$|E

40|$|Issues {{of ethical}} {{marketing}} practice {{are becoming more}} important as the popularity <b>of</b> <b>mediation</b> grows, and as its use as a dispute resolution option of first resort increases.

Therefore, the mediation profession must be clear, accurate and ethical about how mediation is marketed. This article considers the issue of ethical marketing practice in the context <b>of</b> <b>mediation</b> through a focus on confidentiality. First, the article explores the theory <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> and its use in the marketing information <b>of</b> key Australian <b>mediation</b> service providers.

40|$|Načelo zaupnosti v mediaciji ima univerzalen značaj. Poznata ga tako anglo-ameriški kot kontinentalni pravni sistem. Načelo zaupnosti pomeni, da se morajo vse informacije, ki izvirajo iz mediacije, šteti kot zaupne, in sicer v vseh fazah postopka, torej tako v fazi dogovarjanja o izvedbi mediacije kot v fazi same izvedbe mediacije. Načelo zaupnosti lahko veže stranke v postopku, mediatorja in vse morebitne udeležence. Pravo vsebino temu načelu pa lahko da šele sodna praksa. Načelo zaupnosti je temeljno načelo mediacije, od katerega je odvisna uspešnost mediacije. Diplomsko delo obravnava, kako načelo zaupnosti v mediaciji razumejo v različnih pravnih sistemih. Primerjalnopravni pregled pokaže, da je razumevanje in uporaba tega načela, kljub svoji univerzalnosti, zelo različno. To pomeni, da je treba biti pri konkretnih postopkih mediacije posebej pozoren na to, kje se bo postopek izvajal in po katerih pravilih, saj bo imelo to neposreden vpliv na obseg in način varovanja zaupnosti. Velika negotovost v zvezi z razlago in razumevanjem načela zaupnosti je povezana s skromno sodno prakso v kontinentalni Evropi v nasprotju z anglo-ameriško sodno prakso. The {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> in <b>mediation</b> has {{a universal}} character. It {{is known to}} the Anglo-American {{as well as the}} continental legal system. Principle <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> means that any information deriving from mediation must be considered as confidential, that is in all phases of the procedure, namely either in the discussion phase regarding the conduct <b>of</b> <b>mediation</b> or in the phase of the conduct <b>of</b> <b>mediation</b> itself. The principle <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> may bind the parties to the proceedings, the mediator and any potential participants. However, this principle is given its true content only by case-law. The principle <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> is the basic principle <b>of</b> <b>mediation</b> on which the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>mediation</b> depends. This thesis focuses on how the principle <b>of</b> confidentially in <b>mediation</b> is understood in different legal systems. A comparative-legal examination shows that despite its universality, the understanding and application of this principle varies significantly. This means that in specific mediation procedures particular attention should be paid to where will the procedure be conducted and under what rules, since this will have a direct impact on the extent and the way <b>of</b> protecting <b>confidentiality.</b> A great deal of uncertainty in relation to the interpretation and understanding of the principle <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> is connected with the lack of case-law in Continental Europe, as opposed to Anglo-American case law...|$|R
40|$|Mediation as an {{alternative}} dispute resolution enables faster, more efficient and less costly resolution of disputes {{in relation to the}} proceedings. Its operation is based on the following principles: voluntary, equality of the parties, neutrality of the mediator, exclusion of the public, efficiency <b>of</b> the procedure, <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> information, fairness. In Macedonia the mediation as {{an alternative}} dispute resolution was introduced by the Law on Mediation in 2006.

40|$|The {{mediator}} gives room {{to conduct}} negotiations in criminal matters. Though, {{the scope of}} application <b>of</b> penal <b>mediation,</b> not only in Albania but beyond, is unfortunately limited to a restricted number of provisions, mainly referring to criminal contraventions. For instance, mediation is possible in cases of criminal offences related to bodily injuries, injury due to negligence, violation of domicile or cafés and so on but we will dwell on this topic latter while the Albanian legislation in the field <b>of</b> <b>mediation</b> will be analyzed. In all these cases and featuring a key characteristic of this Institute {{is the fact that}} mediation is not compulsory. Judicial authorities and all other operators of the justice system cannot force the victims or perpetrators of offences to consent to mediation procedure. This may occur in no case. The victims and perpetrators may and should jointly decide to initiate the mediation procedure, referring to the mediator or mediators. In respect of juveniles, as equally applied in the criminal and criminal procedural legislation, the organic law on mediation provides all necessary safeguards provided for in the domestic and international legislation (Paragraph No. 12 of Recommendation No. R (99) 19 of the Committee of Ministers addressed to the member states in respect <b>of</b> <b>mediation</b> in criminal matters (Approved by the Committee of Ministers on 15 September 1999 in the 697 th meeting of the deputy ministers).

Consideration of the appropriateness <b>of</b> <b>mediation</b> within this forum must take into account both the context (the objectives of the court or tribunal, the potential for bias, and whether mediation is mandatory) and the content (the power differences of the parties, the appropriateness <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> and the ability to monitor ‘fairness’) of the decision being reviewed.

40|$|This thesis maps {{the present}} {{situation}} <b>of</b> court-connected <b>mediation</b> in Malaysia. Such mediation takes two forms: court-annexed mediation undertaken by a private mediator and judge-led mediation undertaken by a judge. It traces the growth and development <b>of</b> <b>mediation</b> in Malaysia; investigates the factors that impact upon the success <b>of</b> <b>mediation</b> in other jurisdictions; and identifies the barriers and the enablers to the uptake <b>of</b> court-connected <b>mediation</b> in Malaysia. It examines in this context theories <b>of</b> <b>mediation,</b> justice and change management. It reviews the literature on these and on the development <b>of</b> <b>mediation</b> in selected common law jurisdictions. Its findings are drawn from that literature and also from two empirical studies: a survey of lawyers in Sabah and Sarawak and interviews with selected interviewees in East and West Malaysia, including judges. The findings identified that the use <b>of</b> <b>mediation</b> has been driven by: its utility in reducing court backlogs; increasing knowledge {{of the benefits of}} mediation; leadership by the judiciary, professional associations and government; training and exposure; and traditional practices <b>of</b> <b>mediation.</b> The findings also identified that three key stakeholders have resisted mediation: judges, lawyers, and the public. This is related to their attitudes and prevailing professional cultures. Judges fear a loss of judicial authority. Lawyers fear losing income. The public lack knowledge <b>of</b> <b>mediation</b> and see judges as the appropriate decision makers to decide their disputes. The thesis also reveals that a sizeable minority of lawyers feel {{they do not have a}} significant role in advising their clients to mediate. This is identified as a key barrier to the greater use <b>of</b> <b>mediation</b> in other jurisdictions. The implications of the findings are that if mediation is to play a greater role in the Malaysian civil court system then a greater emphasis on education and awareness of the importance <b>of</b> <b>mediation</b> and its benefits amongst stakeholders is required. It makes a number of recommendations for the more effective use <b>of</b> court-connected <b>mediation</b> including consideration <b>of</b> mandatory <b>mediation...</b>|$|R
