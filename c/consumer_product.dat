5|$|As {{a result}} of the company's deteriorating {{financial}} situation, Nakayama resigned as president of Sega in January 1998 in favor of Irimajiri. Stolar would subsequently accede to become CEO and president of Sega of America. Following five years of generally declining profits, in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998, Sega suffered its first parent and consolidated financial losses since its 1988 listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Due to a 54.8% decline in <b>consumer</b> <b>product</b> sales (including a 75.4% decline overseas), the company reported a consolidated net loss of ¥35.6 billion (US$269.8 million). Shortly before announcing its financial losses, Sega revealed that it was discontinuing the Saturn in North America, with the goal of preparing for the launch of its successor. This decision effectively left the Western market without Sega games for over one year. Rumors about the upcoming Dreamcast—spread mainly by Sega itself—leaked to the public before the last Saturn games were released.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Pong, Bushnell pushed his {{employees}} to create new products. In 1974, Atari engineer Harold Lee proposed a home version of Pong that would connect to a television: Home Pong. The system began development under the codename Darlene, named after an attractive female employee at Atari. Alcorn worked with Lee to develop the designs and prototype, and based them on the same digital technology used in their arcade games. The two worked in shifts to save time and money; Lee worked on the design's logic during the day, while Alcorn debugged the designs in the evenings. After the designs were approved, fellow Atari engineer Bob Brown assisted Alcorn and Lee in building a prototype. The prototype consisted of a device attached to a wooden pedestal containing over a hundred wires, which would eventually be replaced with a single chip designed by Alcorn and Lee; the chip {{had yet to be}} tested and built before the prototype was constructed. The chip was finished {{in the latter half of}} 1974, and was, at the time, the highest-performing chip used in a <b>consumer</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E

Following five years of generally declining profits, in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998 Sega suffered its first parent and consolidated financial losses since its 1988 listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Due to a 54.8% decline in <b>consumer</b> <b>product</b> sales (including a 75.4% decline overseas), the company reported a net loss of ¥43.3 billion (US$327.8 million) and a consolidated net loss of ¥35.6 billion (US$269.8 million). Shortly before announcing its financial losses, Sega revealed that it was discontinuing the Saturn in North America, with the goal of preparing for the launch of its successor. Only 12 Saturn games were released in North America in 1998 (Magic Knight Rayearth being the final official release), compared to 119 in 1996. The Saturn would last longer in Japan and Europe. Rumors about the upcoming Dreamcast—spread mainly by Sega itself—were leaked to the public before the last Saturn games were released. The Dreamcast was released on November 27, 1998 in Japan and on September 9, 1999 in North America. The decision to abandon the Saturn effectively left the Western market without Sega games for over one year. Sega suffered an additional ¥42.881 billion consolidated net loss in the fiscal year ending March 1999, and the company announced plans to eliminate 1,000 jobs, or nearly one-fourth of its workforce.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Though {{many options}} exist, the {{application}} of integrated PV systems in mass produced <b>consumer</b> <b>products</b> is still unusual and rare [1]. Therefore, to date, design and manufacturing aspects of product-integrated PV systems have been explored only to a very limited extent. The requirements {{for the design of}} <b>consumer</b> <b>products</b> are evidently different from those for PV systems. Moreover, product designers and manufacturers are unaware of the use of PV cells in <b>consumer</b> <b>products.</b> Hence, the technical challenges of meeting space constraints and increasing performance [2] might be huge for PV system integration in <b>consumer</b> <b>products,</b> but the challenge of implementing PV cells in industrial design processes of mass manufacturing of consumer goods might be bigger. Therefore, we assess how industrial design methods, new materials and production processes can be applied in order to better integrate PV cells in <b>consumer</b> <b>products.</b> A number of possible methods and processes are presented and suggestions are given for further research and development...|$|R
