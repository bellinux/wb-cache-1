Despite their double-error patterns that minimize the number of mis-assigned σ sequences, <b>combined</b> <b>methods</b> further minimize the length for mis-assigned σ sequences. The s value coming from siz 1 m is designed to be dependent on the lengths of observable σ sequences, such that long sequences (on which the method performs well) are given high scores and utterly short sequences (where the method sometimes is wrong) are given low scores. Typical error pattern for <b>combined</b> <b>methods</b> are therefore double errors that contain single short sequences, typically consisting of one or two frames, which explains the high frame accuracy of these <b>combined</b> <b>methods.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It {{has been}} {{accepted}} that multiple classifier systems provide a platform for not only performance improvement, but more efficient and robust pattern classification systems. A variety of <b>combining</b> <b>methods</b> have been proposed in the literature and some work has focused on comparing and categorizing these approaches. In this paper we present a new categorization of these combining schemes based on their dependence on the data patterns being classified. <b>Combining</b> <b>methods</b> can be totally independent from the data, or they can be implicitly or explicitly dependent on the data. It is argued that data dependent, and especially explicitly data dependent, approaches represent the highest potential for improved performance. On {{the basis of this}} categorization, an architecture for explicit data dependent <b>combining</b> <b>methods</b> is discussed.

Using the mean square forecast error (MSFE) metric, we investigate the performance of the forecast <b>combining</b> <b>methods</b> over the last decade, as well as five periods centered on the last five US recessions.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} wireless relay {{networks for}} use in industrial applications with strict requirements on both reliable and timely communications.

We evaluate three different hard decision packet <b>combining</b> <b>methods</b> for different placement of the source, the relay node and the destination. Packet combining can in general be improved with knowledge of the current channel state information, which, however, is often not available.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine three methods for {{combining}} the variance reduction techniques of antithetic variates and control variates {{to estimate the}} mean response in a designed simulation experiment. In <b>Combined</b> <b>Method</b> I, we perform h independent pairs of simulation runs as follows [...] -on the second run of each such pair, we use random number streams that are antithetic (complementary) to the streams used on the first run of the pair to drive the non-control-variate components of the simulation model; and we use independent random number streams to drive the control-variate components of the simulation model. In <b>Combined</b> <b>Method</b> II, we also perform h independent pairs of runs; but on each pair of runs we use independent random number streams to drive the non-control-variate model components, and we use antithetic random number streams to drive the control-variate components. In <b>Combined</b> <b>Method</b> III, all of the random number streams driving the second run of each pair of runs are antithetic to the streams driving the first run of the pair. For {{each of these three}} methods we drive the variance of the resulting estimator of the mean response to make a theoretical comparison of the efficiency of each method.
