60|$|What {{manner of}} men they were {{it is hard}} to say, so few details are left to us. But we may {{conceive}} them as a tall, fair-haired people, clothed in shirts and smocks of embroidered linen, and gaiters <b>cross-strapped</b> with hide; their arms and necks encircled with gold and silver rings; the warriors, at least of the upper class, well horsed, and armed with lance and heavy sword, with chain-mail, and helmets surmounted with plumes, horns, towers, dragons, boars, and the other strange devices which are still seen on the crests of German nobles. This much we can guess; for in this way their ancestors, or at least relations, the War-Geats, appear clothed in the grand old song of Beowulf. Their land must have been tilled principally by slaves, usually captives taken in war: but the noble mystery of the forge, where arms and ornaments were made, was an honourable craft for men of rank; and their ladies, as in the middle age, prided themselves on their skill with the needle and the loom. Their language has been happily preserved to us in Ulfilas' Translation of the Scriptures. For these Goths, the greater number of them at least, were by this time Christians, or very nearly such. Good Bishop Ulfilas, brought up a Christian and consecrated by order of Constantine the Great, had been labouring for years to convert his adopted countrymen from the worship of Thor and Woden. He had translated the Bible for them, and had constructed a Gothic alphabet for that purpose. He had omitted, however (prudently as he considered) the books of Kings, with their histories of the Jewish wars. The Goths, he held, were only too fond of fighting already, and 'needed in that matter the bit, rather than the spur.' He had now a large number of converts, some of whom had even endured persecution from their heathen brethren. Athanaric, 'judge,' or alderman of the Thervings, had sent through the camp--so runs the story--the waggon which bore the idol of Woden, and had burnt, with their tents and their families, those who refused to worship.|$|E

40|$|The {{controllability}} and steady-state {{response of}} parallel-redundant flight control systems are examined. It is found that state components which {{appear in the}} parallel signal paths, e. g., individual actuator commands, are not controllable, although {{the sum of the}} command signals is well-behaved. If the response modes associated with these components are not stable, bias errors can cause the components to diverge, leading to the possibility of 'nuisance trips' in failure detection/isolation logic and eventual control system lockup (at saturation). Combining the inputs to the control computers assures that sensor bias will not cause divergence, while <b>cross-strapping</b> control strings bounds divergent response to all bias error inputs.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the final results}} of a study analyzing different Guidance, Navigation and Control (GN&C) architectural approaches for fault tolerance in National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) crewed and robotic exploration space systems. GN&C systems were decomposed into simple building block subunits of sensors, computers, and actuators and various forms of subunit interconnection were defined for investigation. The resulting subunit/interconnection construct {{was used as a}} top-level abstraction for building candidate GN&C system architectures. This model was implemented using Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT’s) Object Process Network (OPN) modeling language in order to more easily enumerate possible architectures and ultimately identify which of these architectures have optimal properties. Dual and triple redundant GN&C system architectures, employing different classes of components, were modeled using the OPN language. The model assumed perfect coverage – 100 -percent accuracy in detecting and isolating a failure. Within the constraints of the model, all possible architectures were rigorously enumerated and the weight/reliability trade-offs of <b>cross-strapping</b> components and using more than one type of component were assessed.

40|$|The Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), {{which was}} {{launched}} November 18, 1989 from Vandenberg Air Force Base aboard a Delta rocket, has been classified by {{the scientific community}} as a major success {{with regards to the}} field of cosmology theory. Despite a number of anomalies which have occurred during the mission, the attitude control system (ACS) has performed remarkably well. This is {{due in large part to}} the fault tolerant capabilities that were designed into the ACS. A unique triaxial control system orientated in the spacecraft's transverse plane provides the ACS the ability to safely survive various sensor and actuator failures. Features that help to achieve this fail-operational system include component <b>cross-strapping</b> and autonomous control electronics switching. This design philosophy was of utmost importance because of the constraint placed upon the ACS to keep the spinning observatory and its cryogen-cooled science instruments pointing away from the sun. Even though the liquid helium was depleted within the expected twelve months from launch, it is still very much desirable to avoid any thermal disturbances upon the remaining functional instruments...|$|R

5000|$|Vanth is a chthonic {{figure in}} Etruscan mythology {{shown in a}} variety of forms of funerary art, such as in tomb {{paintings}} and on sarcophagi. Vanth is a female deity in the Etruscan underworld that is often accompanied either by additional Vanth figures or by another deity, Charun (later referred to as Charu). Both Vanth and Charun are only seen in iconography beginning c. 400 BC, in the middle period of Etruscan art, although some earlier inscriptions mention her name. [...] Vanth has no direct counterpart in Greek mythology, and is very frequently, but not always, seen winged. Although Vanth has no real Greek counterpart, she has been compared to the Greek Furies, the Erinyes, especially in older publications. [...] This is an unlikely association since she is almost always shown in Etruscan iconography to be a benevolent guide, not an avenging spirit, which the Furies often represent. Her other attributes include the possession of a torch, key, or scroll, and she is shown often to be bare-chested with <b>cross-straps</b> across her breast, adorned with fur boots, a rolled short chiton, and sometimes with unattached sleeves. In fact her dress has been attributed by Scheffer as specifically the dress of a huntress.|$|R
40|$|The {{successful}} implementation of ion thruster technology on the Deep Space 1 technology demonstration mission {{paved the way for}} its first use on the Dawn science mission, which launched in September 2007. Both Deep Space 1 and Dawn used a "bang-bang" xenon feed system which has proven to be highly successful. This type of feed system, however, is complex with many parts and requires a significant amount of engineering work for architecture changes. A simplified feed system, with fewer parts and less engineering work for architecture changes, is desirable to reduce the feed system cost to future missions. An attractive new path for ion thruster feed systems is based on new components developed by industry in support of commercial applications of electric propulsion systems. For example, since the launch of Deep Space 1 tens of mechanical xenon pressure regulators have successfully flown on commercial spacecraft using electric propulsion. In addition, active proportional flow controllers have flown on the Hall-thruster-equipped Tacsat- 2, are flying on the ion thruster GOCE mission, and will fly next year on the Advanced EHF spacecraft. This present paper briefly reviews the Dawn xenon feed system and those implemented on other xenon electric propulsion flight missions. A simplified feed system architecture is presented that is based on assembling flight-qualified components in a manner that will reduce non-recurring engineering associated with propulsion system architecture changes, and is compared to the NASA Dawn standard. The simplified feed system includes, compared to Dawn, passive high-pressure regulation, a reduced part count, reduced complexity due to <b>cross-strapping,</b> and reduced non-recurring engineering work required for feed system changes. A demonstration feed system was assembled using flight-like components and used to operate a laboratory NSTAR-class ion engine. Feed system components integrated into a single-string architecture successfully operated the engine over the entire NSTAR throttle range over a series of tests. Flow rates were very stable with variations of at most 0. 2 %, and transition times between throttle levels were typically 90 seconds or less with a maximum of 200 seconds, both significant improvements over the Dawn bang-bang feed system...|$|R
50|$|Some alumni of {{the corps}} refused {{to see the}} Blue Stars die. Building a new organization, LBS Cadets, Inc., on {{the ashes of the}} old, they {{returned}} a corps the field in 1983, competing in the Cadet Corps International circuit under the name, Blue Star Cadets, because the original corps and the Blue Stars name were still encumbered with debt. In 1985, the Blue Star Cadets began competing in Class A60 in Drum Corps Midwest (DCM), which the original corps had helped found in 1978. In 1986, the Blue Star Cadets finished 7th of 20 corps in the DCI Class A60 prelims. Although the corps missed making DCI Finals, the new organization had paid off enough of the old one's debt to regain use of the name, Blue Stars. In the years after regaining its name, the Blue Stars {{became one of the most}} consistently competitive corps in Divisions II and III (now Open Class), never placing lower than 5th in its division. The corps won the Class A60 World Championship in 1989 and the renamed Division III World Championship titles in 1993, 2001, and 2003. Disaster loomed in 2003, however, when the corps's fundraising bingo operation suddenly began losing money. A plea to the drum corps public resulted in an influx of funds that saw the corps survive the season that culminated with its fourth DCI title--- earned while going undefeated in competition. The reorganization resulting from the crisis directed more attention across the river from Wisconsin into Minnesota and out into the rest of the Midwest with the result that the corps doubled in size from 53 to over one hundred members and moved into Division II competition for 2004.With the move to Division II, the Blue Stars began planning for expansion to the then-maximum drum corps size of 135 members and a return to Division I competition. In 2004, the corps placed 5th in Division II, rose to 3rd place in 2005, and returned to Division I competition in 2006 for the first time since 1982. In 2006 and 2007, the corps finished in 14th place at the DCI Division I World Championship Finals. In 2007, the corps introduced a more contemporary uniform design, abandoning the <b>cross-straps</b> and buckle used for the majority of its existence, although their trademark helmet was retained until late in the 2008 season. In 2008, the Blue Stars returned to DCI Finals for the first time since 1979, finishing in 8th place in the World Class Finals. The corps went on to make finals consistently until 2012 where they placed 13th but made it back into finals in 2013 placing 12th, then moved up to 9th place in 2014.|$|R
