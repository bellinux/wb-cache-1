The primary {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to test the hypothesis that the transfer prices of the corporate resource, logs, should be their competitive market prices. This is what economic theory suggest. The study tests it in short term log allocation decision making of a typical, decentralized Pacific Northwest forest products firm. In a decentralized firm, the milling division and timber division are profit centers. The headquarters sets transfer prices and lets the milling and timber divisions determine the allocation of logs. The goal is to maximize the <b>corporate</b> <b>profit</b> which is the sum of the divisional profits. The transfer prices should be such that the <b>corporate</b> <b>profit</b> is as close as possible to the globally maximum <b>corporate</b> <b>profit</b> of a centralized firm under perfect knowledge.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{mechanism}} through which dividend and <b>corporate</b> <b>profit</b> taxes affect investment and asset returns in a stochastic general equilibrium model. We find that proportional dividend taxes do not distort investment decisions, {{and have no}} impact on asset returns. By contrast, <b>corporate</b> <b>profit</b> taxes distort investment decisions, and introduce additional tax-related risk factors into the economy. We uncover a mechanism through which corporate taxes amplify the responses of consumption and investment to technology shocks, {{which leads to a}} lower risk-free interest rate and a higher equity premium. This amplification mechanism is the strongest when there exists a strong preference for consumption smoothing and high costs of adjusting the capital stock...|$|R

25|$|The {{statistics}} used {{to track}} the share of income going to the top 1% have been criticized by Alan Reynolds. He {{points out that the}} Tax Reform Act of 1986 changed the way that income is defined on tax returns, which is the primary source of data utilized to compile income shares. Among these changes includes the fact that beginning in the 1980s, many C-Corporations switched to S-Corporations, which changed the way that their income is reported on income tax returns. S-Corporations report all income on the individual income tax returns of the owners, while C-Corporations file a separate tax return and <b>corporate</b> <b>profits</b> are not allocated to any individuals. Prior to 1986, approximately one fourth of all American corporations were S-Corporations, but by 1997 this share had risen to more than half. In addition, by 2001 S-Corporations were responsible for about 25% of before-tax profits.|$|E

The group demanded a yearly cost-of-living adjustment for all contracts, productivity pay increases linked to company profit margins, and price controls. But the WSB's public and corporate representatives were in agreement that the board should only focus on wages, and strictly control wages to keep inflation in check.|$|E

40|$|The radical {{reorientation}} of {{the federal}} budget during the 1980 s provided generously for military expansion at the expense of pressing social needs. In the wake of such dramatic upheavals, the federal government will eventually be compelled to seek out new sources of revenue in order to compensate for the decade of neglect. But where will the resources be found to close the deficit, fully fund education, support the sick and impoverished, rebuild the infrastructure, and cleanup the environment? The Economic Policy Institute has placed a price tag of $ 65 billion on these necessities. As policy makers survey the revenue alternatives - military cuts, a more progressive income tax, a corporate take-over tax - one area they should not overlook is the <b>corporate</b> <b>profit</b> tax. Most people were aware that the <b>corporate</b> <b>profit</b> tax provided relatively little revenue in support of federal expenditures during the 1980 s. But perhaps less well-known is the fact that corporations have enjoyed a steady decrease in their tax share for the past three decades. In 1960 <b>corporate</b> <b>profit</b> taxes financed approximately 22 % of all expenditures by the federal government compared to only 7 % in 1986. By exploring the reasons for this decline it becomes possible to appreciate the magnitude of the potential revenue that could be generated from corporate tax reform. ...|$|R
