5|$|In 1954, Krichell {{was honored}} by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) with the William J. Slocum Memorial Award. Named after the former head sportswriter of the New York Journal American and {{president}} of the BBWAA, the award honored his longevity in baseball. The final players Krichell signed were two bonus babies: infielder Tom Carroll from Notre Dame University and Frank Leja, an 18-year-old first baseman. Krichell advised the Yankees staff to sign Carroll for $30,000 ($ in 2010) and he thought Leja <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> Gehrig, but both flopped. By the time he retired, he was the most experienced employee still working for the Yankees.|$|E
5|$|The {{genesis of}} the project came in 1998 as Pixar was {{finishing}} work on A Bug's Life. At that time Jorgen Klubien began writing a new script called The Yellow Car, about an electric car living in a gas-guzzling world. Some of the original drawings and characters were produced in 1998 and the producers agreed that Cars <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> movie after A Bug's Life and would be released in early 1999, particularly around June 4. However, the movie was eventually scrapped in favor of Toy Story 2. Later, production resumed with major script changes, like giving Mater, Doc, {{and a few other}} characters a bigger part.|$|E
5|$|Three group 3 {{elements}} occur naturally, scandium, yttrium, {{and either}} lanthanum or lutetium. Lanthanum continues the trend started by two lighter members in general chemical behavior, while lutetium behaves more similarly to yttrium. While {{the choice of}} lutetium would be {{in accordance with the}} trend for period 6 transition metals to behave more similarly to their upper periodic table neighbors, the choice of lanthanum is in accordance with the trends in the s-block, which the group 3 elements are chemically more similar to. They all are silvery-white metals under standard conditions. The fourth element, either actinium or lawrencium, has only radioactive isotopes. Actinium, which occurs only in trace amounts, continues the trend in chemical behavior for metals that form tripositive ions with a noble gas configuration; synthetic lawrencium is calculated and partially shown to be more similar to lutetium and yttrium. So far, no experiments have been conducted to synthesize any element that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> group 3 element. Unbiunium (Ubu), which could be considered a group 3 element if preceded by lanthanum and actinium, might be synthesized in the near future, it being only three spaces away from the current heaviest element known, oganesson.|$|E

5|$|So far, no {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} synthesize any element that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> group 3 element; if lutetium and lawrencium {{are considered to be}} group 3 elements, then the next element in the group should be element 153, unpenttrium (Upt). However, after element 120, filling electronic configurations stops obeying Aufbau principle. According to the principle, unpenttrium should have an electronic configuration of 8s25g186f147d1 and filling the 5g-subshell should be stopped at element 138. However, the 7d-orbitals are calculated to start being filled on element 137, while the 5g-subshell closes only at element 144, after filling of 7d-subshell begins. Therefore, it is hard to calculate which element should be the next group 3 element. Calculations suggest that unpentpentium (Upp, element 155) could also be the next group 3 element. If lanthanum and actinium are considered group 3 elements, then element 121, unbiunium (Ubu), should be the fifth group 3 element. The element is calculated have electronic configuration of 8s28p1/21, which is not associated with transition metals, without having a partially filled d-subshell. No experiments have been performed to create unpenttrium, unbiunium or any element that could be considered the next group 3 element; however, unbiunium is the element with the lowest atomic number that has not been tried to be created and thus has chances to be, while unpenttrium, unpentpentium or any other element considered if preceded by lawrencium is very unlikely to be created due to drip instabilities that imply that the periodic table ends soon after the island of stability at unbihexium.|$|E

25|$|The British Foreign Office then {{appointed}} Brooke as {{a diplomat}} to Brunei in 1845 and {{asking him to}} co-operate with Bethune. At the same time, Lord Aberdeen who is the British Foreign Minister at the time {{sent a letter to}} the Sultan of Brunei requesting the Sultan to not enter any treaties with other foreign powers while the island was under consideration as a British base. On 24 February 1845, Admiral Bethune with his HMS Driver and several other political commission left Hong Kong to surveyed the island more. The crews found that it is the most suitable for inhabitants than any other island in the coast of Borneo especially with its coal deposits. The British also sees the potential the island <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> Singapore.

25|$|The skikimate pathway is {{a target}} for {{herbicides}} and other non-toxic drugs because the shikimate pathway is not present in humans. Glyphosate, a commonly used herbicide, is an inhibitor of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase or EPSP synthase, an enzyme in the shikimate pathway. The problem is that this herbicide has been utilized for about 20 years and now some plants have now emerged that are glyphosate-resistant. This has relevance to research on shikimate dehydrogenase because {{it is important to}} maintain diversity in the enzyme blocking process in the shikimate pathway and with more research shikimate dehydrogenase <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> enzyme to be inhibited in the shikimate pathway. In order to design new inhibitors the structures for all the enzymes in the pathway have needed to be elucidated. The presence of two forms of the enzyme complicate the design of potential drugs because one could compensate for the inhibition of the other. Also there the TIGR data base shows that there are 14 species of bacteria with the two forms of shikimate dehydrogenase. This is a problem for drug makers because there are two enzymes that a potential drug would need to inhibit at the same time.|$|E

[...] Her first starring role for MGM was scheduled to be an adaptation of The Sea-Wolf, co-starring Clark Gable, but the project was eventually shelved. Instead, she was assigned opposite teen idol Mickey Rooney in the Andy Hardy film Love Finds Andy Hardy (1938). This appearance, as a flirtatious girl described as [...] "the kissing bug," [...] convinced Louis B.

500|$|In 1944, Miller {{was again}} {{selected}} for the RAAF team. Near-death experiences and the knowledge that he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> to die, changed Miller's outlook to life. An RAAF teammate was killed on a mission soon after hitting a century. In a match against the British Civil Defence Services at Lord's in July, Miller had reached 96 when an air raid siren signalled {{the arrival of a}} German flying bomb. It landed south of the ground and then Miller struck a four to register his ton before another flying bomb crashed close to the ground as he saluted the crowd. In a match against England, which boasted five capped and four future England Test players, Miller scored 85 in 100 minutes. While Miller was at the crease, the RAAF was on track to reach its target but his partners were dismissed around him and the RAAF fell 33 runs short after losing its last seven wickets for 51 runs. He took match figures of 6/28 against the West of England at Bristol, and top-scored in the second innings of a low-scoring match with 14. Miller was also {{selected for the}} Dominions match against England, scoring 30 in a drawn encounter. The success of the season, especially Miller and Keith Carmody's attractive batting, prompted Warner to begin planning for a [...] "Test" [...] series between the respective armed services of England and Australia.|$|E
