5|$|The RESCU Traffic <b>Cameras</b> <b>are</b> {{located at}} regular {{intervals}} along the parkway. The cameras, which are operated by the City of Toronto, can be viewed on television and online. The <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> located on poles and are fixed in direction. There are 16 camera locations on the parkway. Most have one camera for northbound and one for southbound traffic. RESCU operators monitor the cameras for emergency purposes; local radio and television media use the service for traffic reports.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in fall 2007 {{there will}} be more than 30 traffic cameras {{operating}} on Omaha area freeways, including one at I-80 near Gretna and another on West Dodge near 120th Street. Operated by the Nebraska Department of Roads, the sensors and <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> not used to catch speeders or for other traffic enforcement. The state also operates an extensive traffic operations center that utilizes the cameras to monitor Omaha traffic patterns. Similar to traffic monitoring centers in Lincoln and North Platte, the one in Omaha is the biggest and has the greatest capability to provide traffic information.|$|E
50|$|The 70mm Fox Grandeur <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> {{manufactured}} by Mitchell <b>Camera</b> Corporation, and <b>were</b> {{based on the}} Mitchell standard 35mm camera, enlarged to accommodate 70mm 4-perf film. The <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> designated as Mitchell Model FC cameras, the FC designation most likely standing for Fox-Case, as the technical specifications and orders for the <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> submitted to Mitchell by the Fox-Case Corporation, pioneers of the Movietone Sound on Film system. The first Fox Grandeur production <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> delivered to Fox-Case New York in May of 1929. An additional four Grandeur <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> delivered to MGM in 1930, and one additional <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> delivered to Feature Productions, also in 1930.|$|R

5|$|In March 2016, the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), the New York City {{office of}} the American Civil Liberties Union, {{wrote a letter to}} Mayor de Blasio {{outlining}} their privacy concerns. In the letter, representatives for the NYCLU wrote that CityBridge could be retaining too much information about LinkNYC users. They also stated that the privacy policy was vague and needed to be clarified. They recommended that the privacy policy be rewritten so that it expressly mentions whether the Links' environmental sensors or <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> being used by any NYPD or city systems.|$|E
5|$|North of Dundas Street, {{the route}} swerves westward onto the {{alignment}} of Halls Road and crosses Rossland Road; a future interchange is planned at this location. It continues north to an interchange with Taunton Road before diverging east from the Halls Road alignment to travel parallel {{between it and}} Coronation Road. The route crosses Highway7 (Winchester Road), where a partial interchange provides southbound access and a northbound exit; a commuter carpool parking lot lay on the northwest corner. Immediately north of Highway7, the route ends at a three-level stack interchange with Highway407E, {{which is also a}} toll route thus no ETC <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> present there.|$|E
5|$|Facilities at {{the station}} are minimal - there are metal and glass shelters on each platform, and some seating. A small ticket office {{operates}} on platform 1 on weekday afternoons, {{but there are no}} other facilities for buying tickets and the station is generally unstaffed. There are customer help points, giving next train information for both platforms, as well as dot-matrix displays showing the next trains on each platform. A small pay and display car park with 30 spaces is {{to the north of the}} station, as are racks for eight bicycles. CCTV <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> in operation {{at the station}}. There is a bus stop located in the station car park however at present no buses serve it.|$|E
5000|$|A folding <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> a <b>camera</b> type. Folding cameras fold into {{a compact}} and rugged package for storage. The lens and shutter are {{attached}} to a lens-board which {{is connected to the}} body of the camera by a light-tight folding bellows. When the <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> fully unfolded it provides the correct focus distance from the film. The key advantage of folding <b>cameras</b> <b>is</b> their excellent physical-size to film-size ratio when the <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> folded for storage.|$|R
50|$|The main (rear-facing) <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> a 13 MP {{autofocus}} {{camera with}} 0.25s autofocus while the secondary (front-facing) <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> a 3.7 MP camera.|$|R

5|$|Inspired by Marge's efforts, Apu {{sets out}} to {{discover}} {{the source of the}} cola, remorseful for selling it in the first place. After some unsuccessful leads, he finally comes across Snake Jailbird, who tells him that the cola trucks are registered to the Springfield Museum of Natural History. Apu and Bart get to the museum, where they find a meteor as the source of the cola. They eavesdrop on a conversation between aliens Kang and Kodos, who are masterminding a scheme. Apu and Bart learn that the wasp <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> filming the antics of Springfield for an intergalactic reality show, Foolish Earthlings. The aliens are using the cola to make people insane, by which time Kang and Kodos will distribute laser guns among the populace to drive the town to a violent massacre sure to draw many viewers.|$|E
5|$|Night Trap is an {{interactive}} movie video game that uses full motion video (FMV) {{to present the}} story and gameplay. The player is instructed by the in-game police squad to watch live surveillance footage of the Martin household and trigger traps to capture anyone that is seen endangering the house guests. <b>Cameras</b> <b>are</b> situated in eight locations {{in and around the}} house: the entry way, living room, kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, driveway, and two hallways. A map is available as well so the player can see how the rooms are connected. The player can freely switch between viewing the different cameras to keep up on house activities and pick up clues from conversations. Kelli, an undercover agent, will also provide clues to the player. The player must avoid trapping her, any other agent, or the house guests.|$|E
5|$|The main {{access to}} the station is from Station Road to the east, however {{there is also a}} set of steps and a {{turnstile}} into the industrial estate to the west. Facilities at the station are minimal – there are small brick shelters on each platform, but no facilities for buying tickets. There are customer help points, giving next train information for both platforms, as well as dot-matrix displays showing the next trains on each platform. A pay and display car park with 15 spaces, and racks for four bicycles, are {{on the east side of}} the station on Station Road. CCTV <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> in operation at the station. Access to the eastern platform is step-free from the car park, however there is no step-free access to trains. The only public {{access to the}} western platform is via the stepped footbridge.|$|E

5|$|C-SPAN {{continues}} to expand its coverage of government proceedings, {{with a history of}} requests to government officials for greater access, especially to the U.S. Supreme Court. In December 2009, Lamb wrote to leaders in the House and Senate, requesting that negotiations for health care reform be televised by C-SPAN. Committee meetings on health care were broadcast subsequently by C-SPAN and may be viewed on the C-SPAN website. In November 2010, Lamb wrote to incoming House Speaker John Boehner requesting changes to restrictions on cameras in the House. In particular, C-SPAN asked to add some of its own robotically operated cameras to the existing government-controlled cameras in the House chamber. In February 2011, Boehner denied the request. A previous request to Speaker Designate Nancy Pelosi in 2006, to add C-SPAN's cameras in the House chamber to record floor proceedings, was also denied. Although C-SPAN uses the congressional chamber feed cables, the <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> owned and controlled by each respective body of Congress. Requests by C-SPAN for camera access to non-government events such as the annual dinner by the Gridiron Club have also been denied.|$|E
5|$|Security on the Delhi Metro {{is handled}} by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), who have been {{guarding}} the system ever since they took over from the Delhi Police in 2007. Closed-circuit <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> used to monitor trains and stations, and feed from these is monitored by both the CISF and Delhi Metro authorities at their respective control rooms. Over 3500 CISF personnel have been deployed to deal with law and order issues in the system, in addition to metal detectors, X-ray baggage inspection systems, and dog squads which are used to secure the system. About 5,200 CCTV cameras have been installed, which cover every nook and corner of each Metro station. Each of the underground stations has about 45 to 50 cameras installed while the elevated stations have about 16 to 20 cameras each. The monitoring of these cameras {{is done by the}} CISF, which is in charge of security of the Metro, as well as the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation. Intercoms are provided in each train car for emergency communication between the passengers and the train operator. Periodic security drills are carried out at stations and on trains to ensure preparedness of security agencies in emergency situations.|$|E
5|$|The safest way to {{view the}} Sun's disk is by {{indirect}} projection. This {{can be done by}} projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of the lenses covered), a telescope, or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it (about 1mm diameter), often called a pinhole camera. The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe sunspots, as well as eclipses. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that no one looks through the projector (telescope, pinhole, etc.) directly. Viewing the Sun's disk on a video display screen (provided by a video camera or digital camera) is safe, although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun. The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> not safe. Securely mounting #14 welder's glass in front of the lens and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible. Professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings will have. In the partial eclipse path, one {{will not be able to}} see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky, however, depending on how much of the Sun's disk is obscured, some darkening may be noticeable. If three-quarters or more of the sun is obscured, then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim, as if the sky were overcast, yet objects still cast sharp shadows.|$|E
50|$|The narrow-angle <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> placed {{inside an}} 80 cm-long {{cylinder}} with {{a diameter of}} 40 cm, and the two wide-angle <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> attached above the cylinder's front area. All <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> based on CCD technology and were supported by state-of-the-art 1980s electronics, including a 32-bit radiation-hardened 10 MHz processor (capable of 1 million instructions per second) and 12 MB of DRAM memory buffer.|$|R
50|$|Subsequently, many single-system 35mm <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> {{produced}} by Wall Camera Corporation, which much later produced the three-film Cinerama cameras. Wall initially converted some Bell & Howell Design 2709 cameras to single-system, {{but most were}} Wall designed and produced. Single-system <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> also {{produced by}} Mitchell Camera Corporation during World War II for the U.S. Army Signal Corps, although these <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> quite rare.|$|R

5|$|The {{conventions}} of Moonlight are based, in part, on a unique mythology. Some {{parts of the}} mythology that are common include a sire, that is the vampire who turns a human into a vampire; though in the show the sire must teach him or her how to live as one. A vampire's bite {{is not enough to}} turn a human into a vampire; the human, when near death, must drink the sire's blood or have vampire blood in his or her system at the moment of death. The process of vampirization also affects their genetics, causing their DNA to be fundamentally altered to suit their bodies' new state. This makes genetic testing between vampires and their human relatives impossible unless the vampire has a sample of their own human DNA from before they were turned, such as a lock of hair. They must consume human blood to survive. They also develop psychic powers and can glimpse the future and the past. This ability, along with their night vision, is an extension of their heightened senses. Daylight does not kill vampires, but does make them progressively weaker. Silver and fire are toxic, whereas garlic, holy water and crucifixes are useless. A vampire's image cannot be captured with analogue cameras containing silver emulsion in the film; digital <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> able to capture an image because they do not use silver emulsion. Though undead, vampires have a pulse, are not cold blooded (but still don't produce body heat as seen in episode 11 so as heat signature cameras won't see them), and cannot turn into a bat. The best ways to kill them are by decapitation or burning; a stake through the heart is painful but only causes paralysis. Moonlight vampires have many of the preternatural abilities as described in vampire mythology; they have superhuman strength and speed, they heal rapidly from any wound, they can defy gravity to a limited degree to perform parkour feats, their bite has hypnotic effects on weak-minded humans, and they are immortal. Their powers increase as they get older. Their blood has drug-like affects when consumed by humans; causing euphoria and temporarily heightened senses.|$|E
25|$|As {{a rule of}} thumb, {{at least}} four <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> needed for {{acceptable}} reconstruction accuracy, and best results are obtained when the <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> placed at approximately 30 degrees normal to the measurement volume.
