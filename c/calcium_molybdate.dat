40|$|Purpose - This paper aims to {{synthesise}} anticorrosion pigments containing molybdenum for paints intended for corrosion protection of metals. Design/methodology/approach - The anticorrosion pigments were prepared by high-temperature solid-state synthesis from the appropriate oxides, carbonates and <b>calcium</b> metasilicate. Stoichiometric <b>molybdates</b> and core-shell molybdates with a non-isometric particle shape containing Ca, Sr, Zn, Mg and Fe were synthesised. The pigments were examined by X-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscopy. Paints {{based on an}} epoxy resin and containing the substances at a pigment volume concentration of 10 volume per cent were prepared. The paints were subjected to physico-mechanical tests and to tests in corrosion atmospheres. The corrosion test results were compared {{to those of the}} paint with a commercial pigment, which is used in many industrial applications. Findings - The molybdate structure of each pigment prepared was elucidated. The core-shell molybdates exhibit a non-isometric particle shape. The pigments prepared were found to impart a very good anticorrosion efficiency to the paints. A high anticorrosion efficiency was found with the pigments Fe- 2 (MoO 4) (3) and Fe- 2 (MoO 4) (3) /CaSiO 3 and with Mg and Zn molybdates. Practical implications -The pigments can be used for the formulation of paints intended for the corrosion protection of metals. The pigments also improve the paints' physical properties. Originality/value - The use of the pigments in anticorrosion paints for the protection of metals is new. The benefits include the use and the procedure of synthesis of the anticorrosion pigments which are free from heavy metals and are acceptable from the aspect of environmental protection. Moreover, the core-shell molybdates, whose high efficiency is comparable to that of the stoichiometric molybdates, have lower molybdenum contents.

40|$|The As- and Mo- bearing {{secondary}} mineral phases formed during the neutralization of uranium mill wastes were studied {{for a variety}} of ore blends including current and future ore sources at the Key Lake milling operation, northern Saskatchewan, Canada. A lab-scale plant model was employed to characterize secondary precipitates obtained during the mill waste neutralization process. Three scenarios of ore blends were processed through the lab-scale plant to produce mill waste solutions for neutralization before combination into final tailings. Slurry samples (n = 12) were collected from the secondary precipitates formed during the neutralization of mill wastes (raffinate) by precipitation with Ca(OH) 2 (slaked lime) from pH 1. 5 to 10. 5. Synchrotron based X-ray absorption spectroscopy of mill and lab-scale plant precipitates showed arsenate adsorbed to ferrihydrite was the dominant As mineral phase regardless of pH or sample blend (53 - 77 %), with fractional contributions from ferric arsenates, and adsorption to aluminum phases (AlOHSO 4, As(OH) 3 and hydrotalcite). Molybdate adsorbed to ferrihydrite was the dominant Mo mineral phase, regardless of pH or sample blend, with fractional contribution decreasing with increasing pH, and minor contributions from <b>calcium</b> <b>molybdate,</b> ferric molybdate and nickel molybdate. These results were used in geochemical modelling to predict the source terms for these mineral phases in tailings facilities. Sequestration of As and Mo in the model showed solubility was controlled by adsorption to both Fe and Al oxide surfaces as well as by direct precipitation with other dissolved constituents (Ni, Ca and SO 4). The models developed pH profiles of mineral phase precipitation to explain the solubility of As, Mo, Fe, Al, Mg and Ni during sequestration from pH 1. 5 to 10. 5 that were consistent regardless of ore blend used in simulations. Since adsorption of anions to the surface of ferrihydrite has been shown to slow conversion to crystalline forms of Fe oxides (goethite and hematite) and sequestration of arsenate effectively controls As solubility at high pH (pH > 10), As-bearing mineral phases are expected to be stable for thousands of years. With adsorption as well as direct precipitation considered, Mo phases though effectively sequestering below pH 8, became unstable and released Mo back into the tailings porewater (pH > 10), as predicted by the thermodynamic model. Historical data obtained from as-discharged tailings as well as previously published U mill tailings studies agree with these findings...|$|E

Neste sentido este trabalho descreve o desenvolvimento e estudo de tintas ecologicamente corretas formuladas usando fosfato de zinco (ZP), molibdato de zinco (ZM), molibdato de zinco e cÃlcio (ZCM), fosfomolibdato de zinco (ZMP) e fosfomolibdato de zinco e cÃlcio (ZCMP), como alternativas seguras aos pigmentos anticorrosivos tradicionais (chumbo, cromo e outros metais pesados). Adicionalmente, consideraÃÃes ambientais tÃm limitado o uso de tintas organossolÃveis devido estas contribuÃrem para a poluiÃÃo atmosfÃrica e problemas de saÃde. Assim, resinas epÃxis hidrossolÃveis foram usadas na formulaÃÃo das tintas epÃxis anticorrosivas. O {{principal}} objetivo deste trabalho Ã empregar pigmentos de molibdatos para avaliar sua eficiÃncia contra corrosÃo em tintas hidrossolÃveis. As propriedades inibidoras dos pigmentos foram avaliadas por curvas de polarizaÃÃo potenciodinÃmica, monitoramento do potencial de circuito aberto e perda de massa por imersÃo de substratos ferrosos (SAE 1010) em soluÃÃo saturada dos pigmentos em 10 - 2 mol dm- 3 NaCl. A caracterizaÃÃo fÃsico-quÃmica dos produtos de corrosÃo foi avaliada por microscopia eletrÃnica de varredura, energia dispersiva de raios-X e difraÃÃo de raios-X. Todos os testes mostraram que os pigmentos fosfomolibdatos apresentaram as melhores propriedades inibidoras de corrosÃo. Todas as tintas foram formuladas com 16 % (v/v) de resina epÃxi, 7, 5 % (v/v) de pigmentos anticorrosivos, e demais componentes e aditivos para manter a relaÃÃo de PVC/CPVC em 0, 8. A espessura da pelÃcula seca de tinta nos painÃis ficou em aproximadamente 120 &# 956;m. O desempenho das tintas foi monitorado por impedÃncia eletroquÃmica durante os testes de imersÃo, de exposiÃÃo atmosfÃrica e de cÃmara acelerado de nÃvoa salina. A estabilidade tÃrmica foi estudada por anÃlise tÃrmica e calorimetria exploratÃria diferencial. Os diagramas de impedÃncia de todas as tintas mostraram somente um arco capacitivo, com os valores de impedÃncia maiores que 109 &# 937;cm 2. os valores de capacitÃncia variaram entre 10 - 6 e 10 - 10 Fcm- 2. Os resultados sugerem que a combinaÃÃo do molibdato e fosfato fornecem as melhores propriedades inibidoras Ãs tintas. Em relaÃÃo Ãs anÃlises tÃrmicas foi possÃvel concluir que os pigmentos de molibdatos e fosfomolibdatos apresentaram o melhor desempenho tanto em relaÃÃo Ã estabilidade tÃrmica da resina epÃxi, uma vez que estes pigmentos mostraram maior interaÃÃo entre pigmento-resina, assim como em relaÃÃo Ã energia envolvida no processo de cura do filme polimÃrico, pois estes pigmentos demonstraram que contribuem para a diminuiÃÃo do calor envolvido no processo de cura. This work {{describes the}} development and study of environmental friendly epoxies anticorrosives paints, which were formulated using zinc phosphate (ZP), zinc molybdate (ZM), zinc and <b>calcium</b> <b>molybdate</b> (ZCM), zinc phosphomolybdate (ZMP) and zinc and calcium phosphomolybdate (MZAP), as safe alternative to more traditional anticorrosive pigments (lead, chromium and other heavy metals). Additionally, environmental considerations are limiting the use of solvent-borne paints because it contibutes to atmospheric pollution and empairs health problems. Thus, hydrosoluble epoxy resin {{was used in the}} formulation of the water-borne paints. The aim od this research is to employ molybdate-based pigments in order to check their efficiency in water borne paints. Inhibitive properties of the pigments were evaluated by potentiodynamic polarization curves, open ciricuit potential (Eoc) and mass loss monitoring during 30 days in immersion test of SAE 1010 steel in aqueous saturated pigment solutions with 10 - 2 mol dm- 3 NaCl. The physical chemical characterization of the corrosion products was carried out by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray and X-ray diffraction techniques. All the tests showed that the phosphomolybdate pigments presented the better corrosion inhibiting properties. All the paints were formulated with 16 % (v/v) epoxy resin, 7. 5 % (v/v) anticorrosive pigment, and additives and fillers {{in order to maintain the}} PVC/CPVC ration equal to 0. 8. the dry thickness of the painted samples was approximately 120 &# 956;m. The paint performance was monitored by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) during immersion tests, of the atmospheric exposition and accelerated ensay of salt spray. The thermal stability of the paintings was also studied by thermal gravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry. The impedance diagrams of all painted samples showed only one capacitive loop, with impedance values higher than 109 &# 937;cm 2. Capacitance values varied between 10 - 6 and 10 - 10 Fcm- 2. The results suggest that the combination of the molybdate and phosphate gives the best inhibitive properties. About the thermal analyses were observed that the molybdates and phosphomolybdates pigments showed the better performances thus in the thermal stability of epoxy resin, because theses pigments showed higher interaction between pigment-resin; just as in the relation the energy involved in the cure process of polymeric film, because these pigments contribued to reduce the heat involved in the cure process...|$|E
