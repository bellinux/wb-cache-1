40|$|In this paper, we give {{two classes}} of {{positive}} semi-definite metrics on 2 -manifolds.

Since the singular sets of Kossowski metrics are the union of regular curves on the domains of definitions, and Whitney metrics admit only isolated singularities, these {{two classes of}} metrics are disjoint.

40|$|The stable {{singularities}} {{of differential}} map germs constitute {{the main source}} of studying the geometric and topological behavior of these maps. In particular, one interesting problem is to find formulae which allow us to count the isolated stable singularities which appear in the discriminant of a stable deformation of a finitely determined map germ. Mond and Pellikaan showed how the Fitting ideals are related to such singularities and obtain a formula to count the number of ordinary triple points in map germs from C- 2 to C- 3, in terms of the Fitting ideals associated with the discriminant. In this article we consider map germs from (Cn+m, 0) to (C-m, 0), and obtain results to count the number of isolated singularities by means of the dimension of some associated algebras to the Fitting ideals. First in Corollary 4. 5 we provide a way to compute the total sum of these singularities. In Proposition 4. 9, for m = 3 we show how to compute the number of ordinary triple points. In Corollary 4. 10 and with f of co-rank one, we show a way to compute the number of points formed by the intersection between a germ of a <b>cuspidal</b> <b>edge</b> and a germ of a plane.

40|$|The {{first chapter}} {{is devoted to}} set out the working plan; it justifies the content and {{outlines}} novel and applied aspects of this work. Chapter II includes the basic concepts behind the entire dissertation. The abstract concept of projective space is briefly recalled here and all those spaces considered as conventional spaces that have been widely analyzed by classical authors are also mentioned in this chapter. Below, some of them whose study had scarcely been approached by the structuralist principles of the Algebra have been listed within the graphical environment. This chapter ends {{with the introduction of}} what we consider is a new concept. We are speaking of spaces of bipoints, birays, tripoints, etc. Those spaces will greatly assist us in deducing certain graphical properties. Chapter III is entirely devoted to the generalization, in all its forms, of the concept of involution, there we establish results as curious as the fact that the involutions of the points of a line are the lines of the two-dimensional space of bipoints contained in it. Once the foundations of the work are established, we move into the Chapter IV to develop the main concept of this dissertation: unicursal varieties. The general concept of unicursal variety is defined at that point, and then we focus immediately on the explanation of the very unicursal varieties. We pushed aside a huge number of useful spaces such as ruled surfaces with unicursal <b>cuspidal</b> <b>edge,</b> polar surfaces of unicursal curves, twisted cubics, unicursal twisted quartics, etc. Any of these topics duly developed could be the subject of a new thesis. In this chapter a general theorem about involutions is discussed, it widespread generalize theorems as classic as the Descargues’theorem applied to families of conics. Some examples of certain complexity are shown in this chapter, where the power of the theorem can be appreciated for deducing complex graphical properties through scant calculations.
