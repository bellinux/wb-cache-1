40|$|This paper {{explains}} the principles {{involved in the}} development of an MS Excel - based decision assistance tool for indirect left (ILT) intersections. this tool, termed Signalized Intersection Life Cycle Cost Analysis (SILCC), analyzes three types of ILT intersections; (i) MUt, (ii) CFl, and (iii) jughandles. SO far, no tools have been developed that are capable of analyzing ILT intersections while incorporating <b>cost</b> and <b>benefit</b> <b>aspects.</b> In contrast, SILCC is designed to incorporate <b>cost</b> and <b>benefit</b> <b>aspects</b> in the evaluation of ILT intersections. It is interfaced with the Highway Capacity Software (HCS) and hence can perform macro-level operational analysis. It considers delay, fuel consumption, and emissions as operational performance measures. It is capable of performing life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) and providing net present value (NPV) and benefit-to-cost ratio (B/C) as surrogate measures of performance. Planners can use NPV or B/C for decision support while deciding among several alternatives for economic and efficiently operating ILT intersections. Additionally, SILCC feature the flexibility to alter input values {{so that it can be}} used for multiple conditions and criteria. A case study of rual traffic volume conditions indication that a MUT intersection had the highest NPV of benefits for both new construction and retrofits.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper explores whether cost audits as {{governance}} mechanism affected the trust of the users of financial statements and whether they provide the benefits intended by regulators. Design/methodology/approach – The research method involved unstructured open-ended face-to-face interviews with cost auditors in practice, mid- to high-level accounts and finance executives of companies and investors. Twenty-three interviews were conducted over a five-week period from December 2004 to January 2005 in Kolkata city of India. The selection of respondents was purposive, to explore the attitudes of these three groups towards mandatory cost audit. Findings – Mandatory cost audit in India has not enhanced the level of trust of investors and preparers of financial statements also have the opinion. It has not brought those benefits expected by regulators. Research limitations/implications – It is suggested following the findings of this paper that future research should carefully consider the usefulness and <b>cost</b> and <b>benefit</b> <b>aspects</b> of the mandatory cost audit in India.

40|$|Human {{welfare is}} {{generally}} referring to {{allocation of resources}} to fit the well being of humans. If high standard of well-being is to be maintained, the concerns for a healthy environment must be balanced against requirements of economic growth. In a natural capital system, human welfare is best served by improving the quality and flow of desired services delivered rather than merely increasing the total money flow. An ecosystem based management of living and natural resource use will steer this progress {{to the best of}} human welfare while the efficiency of ecosystem based management depends strongly on the availability of integrated assessment tools that will combine environmental models and monitoring data with ecological economic valuation methods. In applied welfare economics, the methodological approach to assess resource allocations towards societal optimality and thereby establish criteria for government intervention is often linked to tools as Cost-ffectiveness Analysis (CEA), Cost-Benefit Assessment (CBA) or Multi-criteria Analysis (MCA). By illustrating an assessment on <b>costs</b> and <b>benefits</b> of the implementation of Hg emission reduction measures in the coal sector, it becomes obvious that for a full analysis of societal <b>costs</b> and <b>benefits,</b> several <b>aspects</b> of Hg pollution, sources, impacts and co-benefits need to be considered...|$|R
40|$|The use of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) {{software}} {{products in}} state-of-the-practice software development {{has shown a}} substantial increase {{during the last few}} years. The benefits of COTS usage are clear: reduced development cost and shorter time-to-market. However, using COTS software in development activities also raises risks such as using software that does not sufficiently satisfy the requirements regarding, e. g., reliability, fault tolerance, functionality. Thus, a sound method that helps to decide which COTS software will be used in a specific development context has become mandatory. This report introduces and describes a well-defined, systematic, and repeatable COTS acquisition process (CAP) and experience of using a tailored version of the process in a Siemens Business Unit. This includes the definition of the process, {{a brief description of the}} activities, and the description of the heuristics for effectiveness and efficiency integrated with the process.

30|$|Done {{thoroughly}} at feasibility, with ‘reference class forecasting’ (Ansar et al. 2013), CBA {{provides a}} necessary though incomplete guide on project go-ahead. Conventionally it is numerical. Inexactness of number inputs into the CBA can be entered as statistical distributions and Monte Carlo techniques {{used to produce}} expected values with confidence limits. The most likely development (MLD) with variation about it should be adopted rather than ‘planning fallacy’ (Kahneman 2012) or optimistic EGAP (Flyvbjerg et al. 2003) that is unlikely ever to arise. Contemporary sensitivity analysis software helps detect where good data are needed, and which are the most critical <b>cost</b> and <b>benefit</b> <b>aspects</b> of the model. If the confidence limits from the Monte Carlo modelling are wide it means that even the numbers are warning that the project is risky. If the confidence limits are narrow there are still the uncertainties that the numbers have not captured, in particular about the future. Circumstances will change but precisely how is unknowable. To illustrate, return to our example of pumped storage schemes. These are huge investments with long operating lives over which payback is required. Yet even now a pilot pumped-heat electricity storage is being developed, anticipated to store energy at 75 % {{of the cost of}} conventional pumped storage. Might today’s pumped storage schemes become obsolete before capital outlay is repaid? Ansar et al. (2014) urge agile energy alternatives with shorter time horizons than conventional hydropower projects. To limit planning fallacy not only is experience of previous similar ventures relevant, but the proponents should not assume their new project is manned by smarter operators and thereby immune to past perils (Kahneman 2012).|$|R

40|$|Genetic {{transformation}} {{techniques for}} pest insects have enabled {{the development of}} novel methods to mitigate the enormous harm done by insects to human health (through transmission of diseases) and to agriculture (through damage to crops or livestock). I use mathematical modelling to analyse strategies using autocidal genetic constructs (dominant lethal genes that are repressible during mass-rearing); in parallel several research groups are developing the strains and the laboratory and field experimental work. Engineered insects would be released in large numbers and compete for mates, and their progeny would inherit one copy of a dominant lethal gene and die. The lethal mechanism can be made stage- or sex-specific. The aim {{is to reduce the}} number of pest insects in a population, suppressing numbers to a less harmful level or local elimination. I examine the evolutionary, ecological, and economic <b>cost</b> and <b>benefit</b> <b>aspects</b> of these novel interventions. I consider application of this genetic technology against agricultural pest insects, combined with genetically modified crop plants engineered to produce insecticidal toxins, to which field-evolved resistance is emerging. Using a theoretical framework, I analyse the gene frequency evolution of resistant alleles and show that strategies using genetic constructs that are selectively lethal only to females could help to manage both pests and resistance. I investigate potential resistance to the lethal mechanism of the genetic construct itself. I use population genetics and population dynamics models to explore the impact of heritable biochemically-based resistance on the effectiveness of genetic strategies for reducing populations of important pests in agriculture or public health. Released insects are homozygous for susceptibility to the lethal construct; this has an inherent element of resistance dilution. Finally, I analyse genetic vector control methods to reduce the transmission of human disease. I combine vector population dynamics and epidemiological models with techniques for assessing cost-effectiveness of a genetic strategy for controlling a vector mosquito, and show that disease elimination is feasible on a practical timescale and economically beneficial.
