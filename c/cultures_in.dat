Further, this study intends to propose practical ways to combine the organizational cultures of the both industries with one another by recognizing their differences. First, organizational <b>cultures</b> were recognized <b>in</b> order of rational culture, group culture, development culture and hierarchical <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> semiconductor industry, and in order of rational culture, hierarchical culture, group culture and development <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> automobile industry. Like this, there were differences <b>in</b> the organizational <b>culture</b> types recognized between the both industries. Second, semiconductor industry was high in affective commitment and job satisfaction than automobile industry, but low in normative commitment than automobile industry. Third, job satisfaction was affected by group culture and rational <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> semiconductor industry and by hierarchical culture, group culture and development <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> automobile industry. Affective commitment was affected by group culture and rational <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> semiconductor industry and by development culture and rational <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> automobile industry.

40|$|High {{concentrations}} of glucose have a protective {{effect on the}} glucoreceptor mechanism for insulin secretion during culture of pancreatic islets in chemically defined media. To study at what level glucose exerts this effect, insulin secretion from β-cell-rich mouse pancreatic islets was measured before and after culture for 1 week {{in the presence of}} different substances. Before culture, glucose and inosine were potent stimulators, mannose and fructose were less potent and xylitol had no effect on secretion. <b>Culture</b> <b>in</b> 3 mm-glucose resulted in a 10 -fold decrease in the insulin response to glucose stimulation. A less marked decrease was noted after <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> 20 mm- or 30 mm-glucose. Inosine-stimulated secretion was much decreased after <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> high {{concentrations of}} glucose, whereas the responses to mannose or fructose were unchanged. After <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> 30 mm-mannose, glucose-stimulated secretion was similar to that observed after <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> high concentrations of glucose, whereas the response to mannose had much decreased. There were no secretory responses to glucose or fructose after <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> 30 mm-fructose, or to glucose or xylitol after <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> 30 mm-xylitol. <b>Culture</b> <b>in</b> 10 mm-inosine did not preserve any significant response to glucose or inosine. The insulin contents of islets and culture media were higher after <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> high concentrations of glucose, mannose or inosine than after <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> fructose, xylitol or low concentrations of glucose. It is suggested that glucose, and to some extent mannose, preserves the glucoreceptor mechanism for insulin secretion by influencing an early stage in glucose metabolism, presumably glucokinase activity...|$|R

5|$|Although {{homosexuality}} among females {{has taken}} place in many <b>cultures</b> <b>in</b> history, a recent phenomenon is the development of family among same-sex partners. Before the 1970s, the idea that same-sex adults formed long-term committed relationships was unknown to many people. The majority of lesbians (between 60% and 80%) report being in a long-term relationship. Sociologists credit the high number of paired women to gender role socialization: the inclination for women to commit to relationships doubles in a lesbian union. Unlike heterosexual relationships that tend to divide work based on sex roles, lesbian relationships divide chores evenly between both members. Studies have also reported that emotional bonds are closer in lesbian and gay relationships than heterosexual ones.|$|E

5|$|As an example, the {{execution}} scene in The Kingdom of This World puts European and autochthonous <b>cultures</b> <b>in</b> opposition {{through the use}} of the spectator-performer relationship. In this spectacle situation, Carpentier is able to juxtapose the Europeans' experience of Macandal's body falling into the flames with the autochthonous (Afro-Haitian) experience of Macandal's body flying off the stake. Through the different, mutable views of the performance that he creates, Carpentier is able to represent an unstable cultural identity. As a second example, the scene that Ti Noel constructs around himself after the sacking of the Sans-Souci Palace presents the reader with a dramatic rehearsal in which Ti Noel represents culturally mobile subjectivity by performing different identities on his own.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{with small}} bands of nomadic hunter-gatherers, Native Americans have {{inhabited}} the Colorado River basin {{for at least}} 8,000 years. Between 2,000 and 1,000 years ago, the river and its tributaries fostered large agricultural civilizations – {{some of the most}} sophisticated indigenous <b>cultures</b> <b>in</b> North America – which eventually faded due to a combination of severe drought and poor land use practices. Most native peoples that inhabit the basin today are descended from other groups that settled in the region beginning about 1,000 years ago. Europeans first entered the Colorado Basin in the 16thcentury, when explorers from Spain began mapping and claiming the area, which later became part of Mexico upon its independence in 1821. Early contact between Europeans and Native Americans was generally limited to the fur trade in the headwaters and sporadic trade interactions along the lower river.|$|E
