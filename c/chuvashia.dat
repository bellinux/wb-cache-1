25|$|Meanwhile, the War in Chechnya spawned {{new forms}} of separatist {{activities}} in the Russian Federation. Resistance to the conscription of men from minority ethnic groups to fight in Chechnya was widespread among other republics, many of which passed laws and decrees on the subject. For example, the government of <b>Chuvashia</b> passed a decree providing legal protection to soldiers from the republic who refused {{to participate in the}} Chechen war and imposed limits {{on the use of the}} federal army in ethnic or regional conflicts within Russia. Some regional and local legislative bodies called for the prohibition on the use of draftees in quelling internal conflicts, while others demanded a total ban on the use of the armed forces in such situations. Russian government officials feared that a move to end the war short of victory would create a cascade of secession attempts by other ethnic minorities.|$|E
