40|$|BACKGROUND: Formation of clot {{fragments}} during mechanical thrombectomy for acute {{ischemic stroke}} can occlude the distal vasculature, which {{may reduce the}} rate of good clinical outcome. OBJECTIVE: To examine the hypothesis that distal embolization can be reduced using stent retriever thrombectomy in combination with Lazarus Cover technology. METHODS: Hard, fragment-prone clots were used to create middle cerebral artery occlusions in a vascular phantom. Three different treatment strategies using Solitaire FR included: group 1 -proximal flow control with an 8 F balloon guide catheter (BGC), group 2 -thrombectomy through a 6 F conventional guide catheter (CGC), and group 3 -a similar thrombectomy procedure to group 2 but including the Lazarus <b>Cover</b> <b>device.</b> The primary endpoint was distal emboli quantified by the number {{and size of the}} clot debris. RESULTS: The Cover-assisted stent retriever thrombectomy significantly reduced the generation of clot fragments 3 ̆e 200 mum as compared with thrombectomy with a CGC, and was similar to the BGC group. Particle size distribution recanalization, with only one failed recanalization with partial clot retention after three passes in one experiment of stent retriever thrombectomy through a CGC. Use of the adjunctive <b>Cover</b> <b>device</b> did not prolong the procedure as compared with control groups. CONCLUSIONS: For a fragment-prone clot, Solitaire thrombectomy in conjunction with the <b>Cover</b> <b>device</b> may lower the risk of distal embolization and is comparable to BGC-protected embolectomy...|$|E
40|$|The Cassini {{spacecraft}} {{has performed}} its four year Prime Mission at Saturn {{and is currently}} in orbit at Saturn performing a two year extended mission. 12 Its main engine nozzles are susceptible to impact damage from micrometeoroids and on-orbit dust. The spacecraft has an articulating device known as the Main Engine Assembly (MEA) cover which can close and shield the main engines from these threats. The cover opens to allow for main engine burns {{that are necessary to}} maintain the trajectory. Periodically updated analyses of potential on-orbit dust hazard threats have resulted in the need to continue to use the MEA cover beyond its intended use and beyond its design life.
