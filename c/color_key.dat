50|$|Around 1965, 3M invented an overlay {{system called}} <b>Color</b> <b>Key.</b> Basically, sheets of clear {{polyester}} were coated with UV-sensitive pigmented emulsions {{in the four}} process colors, cyan, magenta, yellow and black. Later, spot colors were created (<b>Color</b> <b>Key</b> Custom Colors). The sheets {{were exposed to the}} artwork via a carbon arc lamp, washed with water and process chemicals, and then dried.|$|E
50|$|There {{is also a}} form of <b>color</b> <b>keying</b> {{that uses}} light {{spectrum}} invisible to human eye. Called Thermo-Key, it uses infrared as the <b>key</b> <b>color,</b> which would not be replaced by background image during postprocessing.|$|R

50|$|If {{there are}} {{duplicate}} colours in the guess, they cannot all be awarded a key peg unless they {{correspond to the}} same number of duplicate colours in the hidden code. For example, if the hidden code is white-white-black-black and the player guesses white-white-white-black, the codemaker will award two <b>colored</b> <b>key</b> pegs for the two correct whites, nothing for the third white as there is not a third white in the code, and a <b>colored</b> <b>key</b> peg for the black. No indication is given {{of the fact that the}} code also includes a second black.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} of dominant color based extraction of key frames for sports video summarization. The visual features {{have been used to}} obtain play field color shots and non-play field color shots. For the every play field color shots dominant <b>colored</b> <b>key</b> frame has been extracted using color histogram analysis and created video summary. This provides users a way to swiftly browse a sports video in different levels of detail, without the need to view entire video. The promising results from user study on dominant <b>colored</b> <b>key</b> frame extraction indicate that the proposed scheme is efficient for video browsing, retrieval and video summarization for the applications of the internet and mobile devices...|$|R

5000|$|Robert C. Dorr (1905-1979) was an American {{artist who}} observed, in 1928, the {{harmonious}} effects of paint colors {{when using the}} same undertone of either blue or yellow. In 1934, in Chicago, Dorr began working on furniture design using his own color theory of undertones and developed his ideas on color psychology. He worked on a textile group for a manufacturer, after which he began working as a professional color consultant for cosmetics companies. Dorr created the <b>Color</b> <b>Key</b> System using color palettes where an individual's complexion is either cool (Key I) or warm (Key II). Those who are Key I have blue skin undertones, hair colors, even blue-white teeth, while Key II individuals have yellow skin undertones and hair colors, and creamy white teeth. The <b>Color</b> <b>Key</b> Program consists of two palettes divided into blue or yellow undertones, Key I and II, each containing 170 colors per fan. In Key I, orange is not represented in the palette, whereas in the Key II palette, magenta is missing. Orange and magenta are the color indicants of yellow and blue undertones. Dorr's <b>Color</b> <b>Key</b> Program took all races into consideration and no race was limited to any one Key palette. After moving to California in the late 1950s, Dorr taught courses and gave lectures on his <b>Color</b> <b>Key</b> Program {{until his death in}} 1979. The color company Devoe Reynolds originally developed, in paint chips, their Key 1 & Key 2 color matching system from Robert Dorr. According to Bernice Kentner, Dorr is the originator and [...] "unsung hero" [...] of color analysis.|$|E

50|$|Interlacing can be {{exploited}} to produce 3D TV programming, {{especially with a}} CRT display and especially for color filtered glasses by transmitting the <b>color</b> <b>keyed</b> picture for each eye in the alternating fields. This does not require significant alterations to existing equipment. Shutter glasses can be adopted as well, obviously with the requirement of achieving synchronisation. If a progressive scan display is used to view such programming, any attempt to deinterlace the picture will render the effect useless. For color filtered glasses the picture has to be either buffered and shown {{as if it was}} progressive with alternating <b>color</b> <b>keyed</b> lines, or each field has to be line-doubled and displayed as discrete frames. The latter procedure {{is the only way to}} suit shutter glasses on a progressive display.|$|R

50|$|By the 1970s, 3M {{developed}} Transfer Key technology, {{which used}} a cold lamination adhesive process. Successive layers of colored adhesive would be pressed on the substrate, exposed and washed away {{until all the}} colors existed on a single substrate. This later evolved into the Match Print product, which used a thermal transfer lamination process. The Match Print trade mark has since been sold to Kodak, which uses it today in its MATCHPRINT InkJet and MATCHPRINT Virtual products. Both <b>Color</b> <b>Key</b> and Match Print have also become generic names for types of prepress proofs. Later, other similar water process products such as DuPont Waterproof came on the market.|$|E

50|$|In 1994 Captain Universe finally gained {{its first}} one-shot, coinciding with a promotion, with {{the claim that}} readers could have a comic about {{themselves}} made for a fee. The comics were generally stock stories, with minor details (such as skin or hair <b>color,</b> <b>key</b> names or phrases, etc.) altered based on {{information provided by the}} purchaser. Veterinary student Jeff Christiansen, who would later become the force behind the resurgence of the Official Handbooks of the Marvel Universe in the mid-2000s was made the official Captain Universe of the comic so that it could be considered an in-continuity comic. The one-shot was titled X-Men/Captain Universe: Sleeping Giants.|$|E

2500|$|Also {{with this}} generation, each model of Taurus {{received}} different exterior trim. The lowest level Taurus L had light grey plastic mirrors and window trim, while the bumpers and side trim were also light grey. The GL, the mid priced model, got chrome window trim and body color mirrors, while still retaining the grey bumpers and side trim. The top-of-the-line LX model had its bumpers <b>color</b> <b>keyed,</b> {{as well as}} having the grey side trim replaced with <b>color</b> <b>keyed</b> body cladding. 1992 L and GL models (and the Mercury Sable GS) could also be ordered with a two-tone paint job, in which instead of being grey, the bumpers and side trim were painted a slightly darker shade of the vehicle's body color. [...] To cut costs, this was discontinued for the 1993 model year, as all models received color-matched trim and bumpers from that year onward.|$|R
50|$|PICMG 2.10 is a {{specification}} by PICMG {{that defines}} {{the use of the}} keying mechanisms defined in IEC 1076-4-101 for the J4/P4 connector and in IEEE 1101.10 for handle and cardguide hardware. Backplanes can be designed for 3.3V VIO or 5V VIO operation. These are differentiated by having 'Cadmium Yellow' <b>colored</b> <b>keys</b> for 3.3V or 'Brilliant Blue' color for 5V operation. If the cPCI card operates on a particular VIO voltage the card shall have the respective <b>colored</b> coding <b>key.</b> If the card is compatible with both voltages then it may not have any coding key. Other coding keys exists for use of backplanes and cards that support PICMG 2.5.|$|R
