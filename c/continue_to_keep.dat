5|$|The Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory of 1898 handed {{additional}} {{parts of}} Hong Kong (the New Territories) to Britain for 99 years, but excluded the Walled City, {{which at the}} time had a population of roughly 700. China was allowed to <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> officials there as long as they did not interfere with the defence of British Hong Kong. The following year, the Governor, Sir Henry Blake, suspected that the Viceroy of Canton was using troops to aid resistance to the new arrangements. On 16 May 1899, British forces attacked the Walled City, only to find the Viceroy's soldiers gone, leaving behind only the mandarin and 150 residents. The Qing dynasty ended its rule in 1912, leaving the Walled City to the British.|$|E
5|$|Polio {{vaccination}} {{programs have}} received resistance from {{some people in}} Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria (the three countries with remaining polio cases). There is distrust surrounding vaccines in Pakistan as in 2011 the CIA organized a fake vaccination program {{in order to help}} find Osama Bin Laden. Additionally, some people believe that the vaccines are secretly being used for sterilization of Muslims. In 2015, the World Health Organization announced a deal with the Taliban to encourage them to distribute the vaccine in areas they control. However, on September 11, 2016, two unidentified gunmen associated with the Pakistani Taliban, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, shot Zakaullah Khan, a doctor who was administering polio vaccines in Pakistan. The leader of the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar claimed responsibility for the shooting and says that the group will <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> doing these kinds of attacks. This resistance to and skepticism of vaccinations has consequently slowed down the polio eradication process within the three remaining countries.|$|E

25|$|Forceful {{government}} control measures, strong public support and enthusiastic citizen participation <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> rat infestations to a minimum. The effectiveness has been {{aided by a}} similar but newer program in Saskatchewan which prevents rats from even reaching the Alberta border. Alberta still employs an armed rat patrol to control rats along Alberta's borders. About ten single rats are found and killed per year, and occasionally a large localized infestation has to be dug out with heavy machinery, {{but the number of}} permanent rat infestations is zero.|$|E
25|$|Hopkins' {{support of}} Abraham Lincoln also often {{put him at}} odds with some of Maryland's most {{prominent}} people, particularly Supreme Court Justice Roger B. Taney, who continually opposed Lincoln's presidential decisions, such as his policies of limiting habeas corpus and stationing troops in Maryland. In 1862 Hopkins {{wrote a letter to}} Lincoln requesting the President not to heed the detractors' calls and <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> soldiers stationed in Maryland.

25|$|As part of {{his effort}} to name a Cabinet which {{included}} all elements of Indonesian politics, Wahid included Wiranto in the Cabinet as Coordinating Minister of Politics and Security. Wiranto was only in his position for three months when in January 2000, Wahid called for Wiranto to step down from his position on an overseas trip to Europe. It appeared as if the President saw Wiranto {{as an obstacle to}} his plan to reform the military and that he took the human rights abuses allegations seriously. Wiranto waited until Wahid returned before meeting with the President to argue his case. Wiranto seemed to have succeeded when Wahid decided to <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him on but changed his mind during the same day and Wiranto was removed from the Cabinet.|$|E

25|$|To Haig’s {{annoyance}} the War Cabinet {{had promised}} to monitor progress and casualties and, if necessary call a halt. Robertson arrived in France (22 July) to be handed a note from Kiggell, urging that the offensive <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> France from dropping out (even if Russia or Italy did). Over dinner Haig urged Robertson to “be firmer and play the man; and, if need be, resign” rather than submit to political interference and on his return Robertson wrote to Haig to assure {{him that he would}} always advise “supporting wholeheartedly a plan which has once been approved”. Robertson met with Cadorna and Foch (24 July) prior to another inter-Allied conference at Paris, and they agreed that the current simultaneous offensives must take priority over Allied reinforcements for Italy, even though it was now clear that the Kerensky Offensive was failing disastrously and that Germany might sooner or later be able to redeploy divisions to the west.|$|E

500|$|Barry and Oliver {{devise a}} plan to deliver Kendra and Carter as a ruse to {{get close enough to}} Savage to destroy the staff. The plan goes horribly wrong; Kendra's powers fail and Savage quickly overcomes the element of {{surprise}} and kills both her and Carter before using the staff to destroy Central City. Barry escapes and runs fast enough to go back in time to the point of the original negotiation before everyone else dies. Barry informs Oliver of his time travel and the mistakes that led to defeat. They change their approach to the plan and Barry is able to steal the staff. He and Oliver use it on Savage, burning his body. Kendra and Carter decide to use their powers to help others in another city. Cisco gives Kendra a tracking device. Oliver agrees to Samantha's conditions for him to see William.

2500|$|In its Fifth Assessment Report (2013), The IPCC {{found that}} recent {{observations}} of global average sea level rise {{at a rate}} of 3.2 [...] mm per year is consistent with the sum of contributions from observed thermal ocean expansion due to rising temperatures (1.1 [...] mm per year), glacier melt (0.76 [...] mm per year), Greenland ice sheet melt (0.33 [...] mm per year), Antarctic ice sheet melt (0.27 [...] mm per year), and changes to land water storage (0.38 [...] mm per year).
