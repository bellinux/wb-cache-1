Wind {{power is a}} promising and rapidly growing clean energy technology. Despite its environmentally friendly reputation, industrial wind energy generation can have serious impacts on wildlife. Bat and bird collision fatality rates have been alarmingly high at some wind farms. Proper siting of wind facilities may help minimize collision impacts; however, there is no reliable method for assessing risks prior to development. My goal {{was to develop a}} method for predicting fatality rates at prospective wind energy sites by monitoring acoustic activity of bats and birds. I monitored bat and bird activity using ultrasonic-acoustic detectors at 160 locations, in a variety of landscape settings to: 1) examine the utility of the detectors for monitoring bat and bird activity for pre-construction site assessment, 2) evaluate the ability of an automated bat <b>call</b> <b>identification</b> program to identify the species of recorded calls, 3) determine how pass rates relate to fatality rates, 4) examine how pass rates vary with respect to specific landscape features, 5) examine how activity differs before versus after a wind facility is built, and 6) investigate whether bat activity levels are elevated near turbines. Ground-based recording was found to be useful for studying near-ground bat activity patterns at multiple scales, but patterns of bird activity were apparent only at the coarsest geographic scale. The bat <b>call</b> <b>identification</b> program produced mixed results among species and regions. No relations between bat pass rates and fatality rates among wind farms were found. Large differences in bat and bird activity among geographic regions were found, with highest levels near Great Lakes coastlines. Also, bat and bird activity was elevated near edges of forested river corridors, relative to distances farther from the edge. Distance to water, distance to trees, and ecoregion were found to be good predictors of bat activity levels. Models of bird activity were of limited usefulness in explaining spatial variation in pass rates. Ground-based acoustic recorders were not found to be a good predictor of bat fatalities; however, they did reveal local and regional patterns that may be useful for siting wind energy facilities in low-impact areas...|$|E

40|$|Automatic {{identification}} of bird calls without manual intervention {{has been a}} challenging task for meaningful research on the taxonomy and monitoring of bird migrations in ornithology. In this paper we apply several techniques used in speech recognition to the automatic {{identification of}} bird calls. A new technique which computes the ensemble average on the FFT spectrum is proposed for identification of bird calls. This ensemble average is computed on the FFT spectrum of each bird and is called the Spectral Ensemble Average Voice Print (SEAV) of that particular bird. The SEAV of various birds are computed and {{are found to be}} different when compared to each other. A database of bird calls is created from the available recordings of fifteen bird species. The SEAV is then used for the identification of bird calls from this database. The results of identification using SEAV are then compared against the results derived from common classifiers used in speech recognition like dynamic time warping (DTW), Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM). A one level and two level classifier combination is also tried by combining SEAV classifier with the DTW classifier. The SEAV is computationally less expensive when compared to DTW or the GMM based classifiers while performing better than the DTW technique. Several new possibilities in automatic bird <b>call</b> <b>identification</b> using SEAV are also listed. 1...|$|E

To maximize {{the quality of}} recordings, we located detectors away from vegetative clutter (Britzke et al. 2013; Loeb et al. 2015). We programmed detectors to record from 30  min before sunset to 30  min after sunrise and defined each recorded file as a sequence of calls separated by ≥  3  s and lasting ≤  15  s. We used Kaleidoscope Pro 3.14 B (Wildlife Acoustics, Inc.) for automated noise (non-bat ultrasound) filtering, initial species classification, and to manually review the spectrograms of acoustic files.

Steady-state partitions of vowels are discriminated and identified mainly {{on the basis of}} harmonics or formants having been resolved by the critical-band filters of the auditory system and then grouped together. Speech-analog processing and perception of vowel-like communication sounds in mammalian vocal repertoires has not been demonstrated so far. Here, we synthesize 11 call models and a tape loop with natural wriggling calls of mouse pups and show that house mice perceive this communication call {{in the same way as}} we perceive speech vowels: they need the presence of a minimum number of formants (three formants—in this case, at 3. 8 + 7. 6 + 11. 4 kHz), they resolve formants by the critical-band mechanism, group formants together for <b>call</b> <b>identification,</b> perceive the formant structure rather continuously, may detect the missing fundamental of a harmonic complex, and all of these occur in a natural communication situation without any training or behavioral constraints.

40|$|Eavesdropping on {{the alarm}} calls {{of other species}} can provide {{vertebrates}} with valuable information about danger, and often responses to heterospecific calls seem to be acquired through learning. However, animals might not require learning to respond to heterospecific alarm calls that are acoustically similar to conspecific calls. Although previous work suggests that learning is necessary for superb fairy-wrens to develop responses to heterospecific alarms, acoustic similarity might also be important. We tested whether fairy-wrens responded to playback of unfamiliar alarm calls and if the strength of responses was affected by acoustic similarity to conspecific calls. We then determined which acoustic properties {{were likely to be}} used in alarm <b>call</b> <b>identification.</b> Birds fled to cover after playback of calls that were acoustically similar to their own but did not usually respond to less similar calls. Fairy-wren aerial alarm calls are high-frequency and rapidly frequency modulated; their probability of fleeing to playback of unfamiliar calls increased in response to calls with increasing peak frequencies, and they spent more time in cover following calls with a number of frequency cycles similar to their own. Fairy-wrens also responded strongly to relatively dissimilar calls of 1 allopatric species, possibly because these unfamiliar calls resembled those of a sympatric species to which they had learnt to respond. Our study shows that acoustic similarity can prompt responses to heterospecific alarm calls regardless of experience and together with previous work suggests that both acoustic similarity and learning are important for interspecific responses to alarm calls.

40|$|Currently, {{a variety}} of methods are {{available}} to monitor anurans, and little standardization of methods exists. New methods to monitor anurans have become available over the past twenty years, including PVC pipe arrays used for tree frog capture and Automated Digital Recording Systems (ADRS) used to remotely monitor calling activity. In addition to ADRS, machine-learning computer software, automated vocalization recognition software (AVRS), has been developed to automatically detect vocalizations within digital sound recordings. The use of a combination of ADRS and AVRS shows the promise {{to reduce the number of}} people, time, and resources needed for an effective call survey program. However, little research exists that uses the described tools for wildlife monitoring, especially for anuran monitoring. In the study, there were two problems addressed relating to AVRS. The first was the poorly understood relationship between auditory survey methods and physical survey methods. I tested this problem by using current auditory monitoring methods, ADRS and the AVRS Song Scope© (v. 3. 1), alongside more traditional physical monitoring methods that included drift fences, a PVC pipe array, and visual encounter transects. No significant relationship between physical and auditory community population measures was found. Auditory methods were also effective in the detection of call characteristic differences between urban and rural locations, further suggesting an influence of noise pollution. The second problem addressed was the <b>call</b> <b>identification</b> errors found in auditory survey methods. I examined the influence of treatments including the ADRS location, listener group, species, and season on the error rates of the AVRS Song Scope© (v. 3. 1) and groups of human listeners. Computer error rates were higher than human listeners, yet less affected by the treatments.

40|$|The caves of the Yorkshire Dales National Park are {{potentially}} an important assemblage of underground bat sites, but {{prior to this}} study nothing was known about the ecology of cave use. Between 2002 and 2005, 53 cave entrances were logged for swarming activity using automated echolocation call loggers. A subset was chosen for continuous monitoring outside the hibernation period and another for winter logging. Logging was followed up by trapping at caves with significant autumn bat activity. All bats caught were ringed, identified to species and sexed. Biopsies (3 mm diameter) were taken from each wing for genetic analysis. A {{large proportion of the}} caves surveyed were used by bats, but activity was concentrated in a small number of hotspots. Peak activity occurred during August and September, but significant activity was recorded in all months between March and October. All five swarming species were caught at most sites: Myotis brandtii, M. daubentonii, M. mystacinus, M. nattereri and Plecotus auritus. M. nattereri was the most abundant species late in September, but earlier other species made up a significant proportion of those caught. The sex ratio of swarming bats was heavily skewed towards males. Swarming activity was positively correlated with the degree of cave chamber development, cave length and shelter at the entrance, and negatively correlated with the amount of water the cave carried. Entrance size, altitude and the degree of connectivity between cave and summer habitat were not correlated with activity. In a multiple regression model, chamber development and hydrology were the best predictors of activity. Entrance orientation and shelter contributed towards the model but were less important. The regression model could explain 55 % of the variance in bat activity. Genetic diversity of Myotis nattereri, based on an analysis of six microsatellite loci, was high in swarming populations suggesting high gene flow and large effective populations. Most of the genetic variation was explained by variation among individuals within populations, but some was due to differences between swarming areas and by differences between populations within swarming areas. Isolation by distance was found between sites in six swarming areas between Cumbria and Sussex, but not between sites in the Yorkshire Dales. The differentiation observed was more logically explained on the basis of local geography and probable catchment areas.
