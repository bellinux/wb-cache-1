40|$|Whenever {{components}} {{are designed for}} use under demanding conditions like high temperatures or a chemically aggressive environment, ceramic materials are the materials of choice due to their high temperature resistance and chemical inertness. For the assembling of complex components, glassy or glass ceramic sealings are used to join the basic ceramic parts. The thermal and mechanical properties of these glass sealings have to match {{the properties of the}} ceramics very well in order to guarantee a tight connection of the ceramic parts. The development of glassy or glass <b>ceramic</b> <b>seals</b> still today {{takes a lot of time}} and effort. In the present work, sealants from the chemical systems MgO-BaO-B 2 O 3 -SiO 2 and CaO-Al 2 O 3 -B 2 O 3 -SiO 2 have been prepared and extensively characterised. Based on these sealants, methods have been developed that allow to modifiy their most important properties: viscosity and thermal expansion. After the glassy sealants had been prepared, fillers were added to the glass. For viscosity modification, crystalline phases with low melting temperatures were added. For the adaption of the thermal expansion coefficient, fillers with a thermal expansion coefficient different from the one of the sealant were added in different amounts. In order to prevent chemical reactions between glass and filler, the fillers were chosen to be coexisting phases of the glass composition. The present study shows that the studied methods are applicable for the adaption of viscosity and thermal expansion. In this way, it is possible to tailor the properties of a well-known seal to the needs of a new application or process and thus considerably simplify the development process of glassy or glass <b>ceramic</b> <b>seals</b> for specific applications...|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 79 - 86 Abradable seals are {{employed}} in turbomachinery to reduce leakage gaps between stationary and rotating parts to improve efficiency and stall margin. Thermally sprayed abradable seals {{have been used in}} the compressor section of jet engines since the late 1960 s. These seals are predominantly coatings made from composite material that derive their abradability from the use of low shear strength materials or form a porous, friable coating structure. Due to the extreme temperatures on the turbine side of gas turbine engines, brazed or welded metallic structures made from nickel (Ni) based alloys have typically been used to provide gas path sealing. When thermal shock resistant ceramics because available, oxide ceramic, mostly zirconia based high temperature abradable seals for the high pressure turbine stages were developed. For the highest temperature stages, thermally sprayed oxide ceramics with or without metallic strain isolators are frequently used. On stages with reduced temperatures both ceramic and metallic coatings of the McrA 1 Y type can be used.
