5|$|On 2 December 2013, {{after more}} than a year of {{testimony}} and over 12,000 pages of evidence, the presiding coroner instructed the jury to begin their deliberations, and requested they <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a verdict in Smith's death and recommendations on means to prevent a recurrence of such an event.|$|E
5|$|The {{goodwill}} {{generated by}} this surprising {{turn of events}} defused the situation, but to many observers the scene on the balcony was mere theatricality without long-term resonance. However pleased {{it may have been}} by the royal displays, the crowd insisted that the king <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> them to Paris.|$|E

After gaining access to the Sevii Islands, an entirely new region, the player discovers Lorelei in her house and convinces her to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> him. Once more, the protagonist must thwart the Team Rocket's plans on several occasions, recover two artifacts, the Ruby and the Sapphire, {{and put them in the}} main {{computer}} at One Island.

5|$|In 1914, aliens {{known as}} Mondoshawans {{arrive at an}} ancient Egyptian temple to collect, for {{safekeeping}} concerning World War I, the only weapon capable of defeating a great evil that appears every 5,000years. The weapon consists of four stones, containing the essences of the four classical elements, and a sarcophagus containing a fifth element {{in the form of}} a human, which combines the power of the other four elements into a divine light capable of defeating the evil. The Mondoshawans promise their human contact, a priest from a secret order, that they will <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> the weapon in time to stop the great evil when it returns.|$|E
5|$|The sixth {{match was}} between Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Jeff Hardy. MVP quickly beat down Hardy and {{dominated}} {{early in the}} match. Hardy tried to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a mule kick from the corner, but MVP {{moved out of the}} way, leading Hardy to crash the mat face first. MVP controlled most of the match, until Hardy finally had some offense with a rope-aided corner dropkick in the corner. With the upper hand, Hardy performed a Swanton bomb on MVP, but MVP moved out of the way. MVP tried to perform a running big boot, but Hardy countered into a drop toe hold. The match ended with Hardy winning the match, after performing the Whisper in the Wind, a move performed by executing a backflip from the top turnbuckle, then spinning 180°, landing on a fallen opponent back-first.|$|E
5|$|Ngwat-Mahop {{played in}} Red Bull Salzburg's opening {{match for the}} 2010–11 Bundesliga season, on 17 July 2010, coming in as a {{substitute}} in the 57th minute, in what was a 0–0 away draw against SV Kapfenberg. Three days later he once again played {{as a substitute for}} Jakob Jantscher, in his team's second leg match, against Faroese champions HB Torshavn for the second Qualifying round of the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League. He scored his first goal of the season in a match for the 1st round of the ÖFB-Cup against St. Pölten II, that Red Bull Salzburg won by 1–4. On 24 August, he made the cross that resulted in Red BullSalzburg's goal, in his team's second leg match for the third Qualifying round of the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League against Hapoel Tel Aviv. Ngwat-Mahop was substituted in the 65th minute of a match that ended an 1–1 draw, resulting in Red Bull Salzburg's elimination. Later it was made known that he was again injured, and due to this he made his <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> Red Bull Salzburg almost three months later, in a 2–0 home win against Sturm Graz. That was meant to be Ngwat-Mahop's last game with the Red Bull Salzburg shirt, as in January he was sold to Greek Superleague outfit Iraklis Thessaloniki for an undisclosed fee.|$|E

25|$|In early 2009, before spring training, {{third baseman}} Alex Rodriguez {{admitted}} to using steroids while {{playing for the}} Texas Rangers during the 2001–2003 seasons. This happened right before a hip injury to Rodriguez, and that stopped his playing time from early March until mid-May. A-Rod would <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a bang, having a 3-run homer on the first pitch he had seen since early spring training.|$|E
25|$|This {{is how it}} was for me. This is how I played it. It's just a pippy-poo {{little book}} and people <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> this {{diatribe}} about its great social significance. Well it's just because nobody ever got off his high horse long enough to write to single women in any form they could associate with. If they had, somebody else would be the arbiter for single women at this point instead of me.|$|E

25|$|His {{debut in}} the Octagon was a third fight with Heath Herring at UFC 73, {{promoted}} under various combinations of his name and nickname, but was officially introduced to the audience under his full name and nickname. Nogueira once again defeated Herring, via unanimous decision. During the first round, Herring landed a head kick that sent Nogueira to the canvas, in which unofficial judge Eddie Bravo thought the fight could have been stopped. Herring let Nogueira get back to his feet, and Nogueira was then able to recover and <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a dominant decision victory.|$|E
25|$|The next day, two Baldwin–Felts men, Hickey and Griggs, {{show up in}} {{town and}} take up {{residence}} at the Radnor boarding house. Danny at first refuses to give rooms to Hickey and Griggs, but Kenehan voluntarily moves to the hotel, freeing up a room for the two men and averting trouble for Mrs. Radnor. Hickey and Griggs then start their campaign against the union by forcibly evicting miners from company-owned houses in town. Mayor Testerman and Police Chief Sid Hatfield refuse to let them be evicted without eviction writs from Charleston. Hatfield deputizes all the men in town and tells them {{to go home and}} <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> their guns.|$|E
25|$|Assad {{has been}} banished by Solomon to the desert. The Queen of Sheba seeks {{him out to}} attempt to {{convince}} him to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> her to her kingdom. She finds him alone, {{not too far from}} Sulamith's retreat, and tries to seduce him. He rejects her advances and in a bitter soliloquy reveals his regret and desire for a death that might redeem his offense against God. Assad then prays for Sulamith, during which time he is engulfed in a violent sandstorm. He is later found barely alive by Sulamith and her companions. He begs for her forgiveness, which she bestows just before he dies in her arms.|$|E

25|$|On May 29 {{he faced}} Ralek Gracie, at the Saitama Super Arena in Dream 14. It {{would be the}} sixth time Sakuraba faced a Gracie, albeit {{this time with a}} deep age difference, given the Japanese (41) and the Brazilian (24)'s {{respective}} ages. During the match, the wrestler performed significantly against the young Gracie, but the latter kept dominating, evidencing a training specialized to counter Sakuraba's style. There was controversy {{towards the end of the}} fight, as Sakuraba seemed to have secured a kimura, only to the referee to pause the match to pull up Ralek's pants. The pause allowed the Brazilian to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> an armbar, which Kazushi escaped to meet a unanimous decision win for Gracie.|$|E
25|$|Like many auks, puffins eat both {{fish and}} zooplankton, but feed their chicks {{primarily}} with small marine fish {{several times a}} day. The prey species of the Atlantic puffin include the sandeel, herring and capelin. The puffins are distinct {{in their ability to}} hold several (sometimes over a dozen) small fish at a time, crosswise in their bill, rather than regurgitating swallowed fish. This allows them to take longer foraging trips, since they can <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> more food energy for their chick than a bird that can only carry one fish at a time. This behaviour is made possible by the unique hinging mechanism of their beak, which allows the upper and lower biting edges to meet at any of a number of angles.|$|E
25|$|Utah {{finds the}} {{location}} of the next ordeal: solo rock climbing with no safety beside Angel Falls in Venezuela. He finds Bodhi and Grommet and chases them on the climb, but Grommet falters, falling to his death. Utah catches up to Bodhi, but he falls backward down the waterfall, completing what would have been the last ordeal; Bodhi has to redo the fourth ordeal because he bailed out on the wave when he chose to save Johnny. Seventeen months later, Utah finds him in the Pacific facing another giant wave. As Utah tries to get Bodhi to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> him and pay for his crimes, he eventually lets Bodhi attempt to surf it, both knowing that he will not come back. The wave engulfs Bodhi, and Utah continues his career in the FBI and begins going through his own eight ordeals.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the quick}} scoring {{and the first}} Test result led many {{people to believe that}} Australia would <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a vengeance {{on the second day of}} the matcht. Instead, Steve Harmison bowled a maiden over first up to Justin Langer, and Matthew Hayden holed out to Harmison's new-ball partner Matthew Hoggard for a golden duck – the first of Hayden's career. The {{dismissal}} was to set the tone of the innings. Although Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer hit runs just as quickly as England had done, the umpire's finger went up twice more before lunch – Ponting swept to the opposing captain Vaughan for 61, and Damien Martyn was run out taking a risky single for 20. Once again, Vaughan was in the action, hitting the stumps with a throw from mid off. Langer and Michael Clarke continued after lunch in the same vein, but again, a couple of quick wickets – Clarke edging a quicker ball from Ashley Giles behind and Simon Katich falling in the same way to Andrew Flintoff swung it England's way. At 208 for 5, the Australians were struggling, but another good partnership between Langer and Gilchrist saw them to tea with no further loss.|$|E
25|$|Mydland {{died of a}} {{speedball}} overdose in July 1990. His death greatly affected Garcia, {{leading him}} {{to believe that the}} band's chemistry would never be the same. Before beginning the fall tour, the band acquired keyboardists Vince Welnick and Bruce Hornsby. The power of Hornsby's keys musically drove Garcia to new heights on stage. As the band continued through 1991, Garcia became concerned with the band's future. He was exhausted from five straight years of touring. He thought a break was necessary, mainly so that the band could <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> fresh material. The idea was put off by the pressures of management, and the touring continued. Garcia's decrease in both stamina and interest to continue touring caused him to use heroin again after several years of intermittent prescription opiate use. Though his relapse was brief, the band was quick to react. Soon after the last show of the tour in Denver, Garcia was confronted by the band with another intervention. After a disastrous meeting, Garcia invited Phil Lesh over to his home in San Rafael, California, where he explained that after the meeting he would start attending a methadone clinic. Garcia said that he wanted to clean up in his own way, and return to making music.|$|E
25|$|On January 17, the Bulldogs went on {{the road}} to play Portland, whom they beat 71–49. Despite two early fouls on Olynyk in the first half, Gonzaga shot 46.6% from the field. Olynyk would <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a strong second half to finish with 21 points, eight rebounds, one steal, and two blocks. The game {{extended}} Gonzaga's best start in school history with an eight-game winning streak. Two days later, they would travel to Hinkle Fieldhouse to play a non-conference game at #13 Butler {{as a part of the}} debut game of ESPN's College GameDay for the 2013 college basketball season. Gonzaga was ahead 33–32 at halftime, but Butler scored the first five points of the second half to take the lead. Ahead 63–62 with 3.5 seconds left, Stockton threw the ball inbounds and watched as it was stolen by Butler sophomore Roosevelt Jones, who took the buzzer beater shot to give Butler the 64–63 win. The team would recover and return home from their second loss of the season on January 24 by beating BYU 83–63. Olynyk scored 26 points on 9-for-9 shooting and was also 8-for-8 on free throws. The Zags won the rebound battle 37–29 and outscored BYU 42–28 in the paint while shooting 56.9% from the field.|$|E
