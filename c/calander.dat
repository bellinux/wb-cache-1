40|$|Given {{their unique}} set of properties, carbon {{nanotubes}} are rapidly gaining importance as stress/damage sensors in addition to as mere reinforcing elements in polymer composites. In this work, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) are used to monitor internal stresses developing during the curing process of thermoset materials. SWCNT-epoxy composites with high dispersion quality were obtained via <b>calandering.</b> In situ Raman spectroscopy was used to identify chemical and thermal induced stresses by following {{the changes in the}} G’-band versus time and temperature. Thermal shrinkage prompts a pronounced effect on the spectral shifts of the composite, pointing at its dominant role (over chemical shrinkage) {{on the development of the}} internal stress field. Above Tg, Raman shifts due to temperature increase are found to be negligible, confirming the existence of a stress releasing mechanism. Shift rate of the composites cooling from their processing temperatures depended on the combination of matrix/SWCNT type, pointing at the role of interfacial strength on the load transfer efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The {{thermoforming}} {{process is}} subject {{to a lot of}} variability with regard to the viscoelastic properties of the material, and the level of residual stresses caused by the manufacturing (extrusion and <b>calandering)</b> process of a plastic sheet. A robust control system must be able to identify and adjust to these perturbations in real time during the thermoforming process. The research project proposes two process sub-models, which predict the behavior of the elastic modulus and the level of frozen-in stresses. These two sub-models will be used in a model based control system, consisting of a number of process submodels encompassing different material properties and machine characteristics. A series of experiments was conducted using an industrial thermoforming machine to measure the elasticity and the level of frozen-in stresses in the material. A bubble inflation technique was used to determine the behavior of the elastic modulus in the transition state between solid and liquid. Additionally, a simulation of the sag that occurs during plastic sheet heating was developed to identify the level of frozen-in stresses...|$|R
40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that quality has become a major feature in the {{survival}} plan of many companies today. Each company employee must be committed to the use of effective methods to achieve optimum efficiency, productivity, and quality to produce competitive goods. Statistical Process Control (SPC), in its broad sense, is a collection of production methods and management concepts and practices that can be used throughout the company. SPC involves the use of statistical signals to identify sources of variation, to improve performance, and to maintain control production at higher quality levels. This work investigates the implementation phase of SPC in a company, which produce rubber flooring. SPC techniques were used to identify the variations of finished tiles and quantify these variations. Stepwise approach was initiated to control the processes and uplift the quality of the finished tiles. Selected processes were monitored, analyzed and improved through multidisciplinary process actions teams. By using awareness and pilot project phases SPC was successfully implemented in calendering line. Root causes for variations in the <b>calandering</b> line were studied through detailed cause and effect relations. Improvements were initiated by treating to the root causes. Using control charts out of control situations were identified and out of control action plan was prepared for to take prompt actions. Accuracy of the testing methods and calibration of measuring equipments were got more attention at each process step. Using planned control charts PATs managed to obtain well-described measurements, knowledge on process control and detection of process disturbances, product assurance, knowledge on the level of control of the process and control limits for process inherent variation. Improvements in rubber flooring quality and consistency were achieved through the use of SPC. This step was not easily or quickly achieved. It required extensive training at all levels, considerable planning, and most importantly, the consistent support from top management in committing the manpower and funding to make it happen...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} thesis is to explore the connection of paper machine wet end process variables to output quality and to specify the levels at which the variables produce the best achievable quality characteristics in multicriteria environment. While existing control methods are mainly based on staff experience, a model providing better predictability and controllability of the process would be of considerable value. The quality criteria in scrutiny are web breaks, variation in base paper grammage, machine <b>calander</b> moisture, machine <b>calander</b> ash content, steam to the machine and base paper holes. The causal relationship is studied using Robust Portfolio Modelling and Bayesian variable selection along with appropriate statistical tests. The methodology allows for making analysis amid uncertainty on both criterion preferences and model selection. Underlying latent factors are identified using Factor analysis and Independent component analysis. Consequently, a methodology for controlling the wet end performance is proposed. The data is adjusted with appropriate time variant process lags calculated from on-line measurement data. Level shifts of base paper grammage due to grade changes are isolated by dividing the data int...|$|E
40|$|In {{this essay}} we will {{highlight}} the professional role {{and development of}} teachers and recreation centers during the 20 th century. We will use the research of, among others, Finn <b>Calander</b> and Ann Pihlgren who have investigated and discussed {{the development of the}} recreation centers throughout the 20 th century. The theoretical basis for the work is social constructivism and the socio-cultural perspective. By using this theories, we will attempt to explain how the recreation center and the recreations center teachers work has evolved and what has driven this development. Furthermore, we will discuss the impact that the teachers’ certification has on the school centers’ teachers and their work. The teachers’ certification has caused some confusion regarding the purpose of the recreation center teachers' mission, both in the universities where the new recreation center teachers’ are trained and among the recreation teachers. We will compare our reasoning to Lgr 11 to see what the governing documents provides in terms of guidelines and guidance for the recreation center teacher profession. The informants who have been interviewed in this work are four recreation center teacher with several years of experience in the profession. The schools where we conducted the interviews, were chosen on the basis of our prior internships there, and due to their geographical locations. The informants were interviewed about the schools they had previous experience of the profession and any disparity they experienced between their assigned work and the actual work, as well as, whether this had changed significantly during their time in the profession. The interviewed informants described that they are no longer comfortable in the professional role they serve at schools as they feel more like extra teachers, something which they have not at all received training for, rather than the recreation center teachers that they are...|$|E
40|$|This project {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} carbon nanotubes as a filler in electrically conducting adhesives {{in order to enhance}} the electrical, mechanical and thermal performance. As the carbon nanotubes caused a marked increase in the viscosity of the adhesive, a low viscosity polymer matrix (< 100 mPas) was chosen. This allowed a high CNT content. Multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were chosen for the experiments because these are available in favorable quantities and at reasonable prices. In order to enhance the dispersion properties, the MWNTs were also treated chemically via ozone/UV and low pressure plasma. For mixing the MWNTs into the polymer matrix different methodologies were tested. Ultrasound was found to be a very effective method, but the dispersion energy drops dramatically when viscosities above 10, 000 mPas are reached. Hence high viscosity adhesives were treated using a <b>calander</b> as described in [1]. In general, good dispersion could be achieved by applying com binations of these two dispersion techniques. Adhesives were produced with varying CNT content, different CNT types and using different dispersion techniques. The influence of these parameters on the electrical resistance, thermal conductivity, impedance behavior and mechanical strength was investigated. In parallel, many samples were analyzed by TEM in order to get detailed knowledge of the adhesive nanostructure and learn how this structure is influenced by the above-mentioned parameters. Furthermore, the absorption of microwave radiation by the samples was investigated in order to further our understanding of microwave absorption by CNT-filled composites. Based on these results, the two standard formulations showing the best performance were chosen for bonding SMD components on a test assembly. For the curing of the adhesives two methods were used: Curing by microwave radiation and curing in a conventional oven at 130 °C. Whilst the conventional curing took 30 minutes, it was possible to complete...|$|E
40|$|The part of {{electronics}} packaging is steadily forced {{to adapt the}} requirements of the microelectronic industry. For future electronics application such needs will be: 1) steady miniaturisation of the electronic devices 2) high pin count up to 5000 i / o per device 3) pitches down to 20 mum 4) higher current density per devices 5) higher thermal dissipation loss This is only a small extract of the challenges facing the electronics packaging industry in the future. The aim and duty for electronics packaging is to realize a reliable package for future electronics. Commonplace materials for joining elements like solder are not able to solve these requirements. For example in [1] the authors describe that future IC's operating at high frequencies of 10 - 28 GHz, signal bandwidths of 20 Gbps and lower supply voltages require an estimated maximum of R (< 10 mOhm), L (< 5 - 10 pH) and C (< 5 - 10 fF). [l] Current joining elements can not meet these requirements. To solve these problems the electronics packaging industry researches technologies and materials of the nanotechnology. Especially researches concerning new materials for electronics packaging rise up since the last three years. One of the most researched new materials are Carbon Nanotubes (CNT). Carbon Nanotubes have superior mechanical, electrical and thermal properties. Due to these properties CNT are considered as promising candidates in packaging technology. The most interesting field of application is the use of the Carbon Nanotubes as filler in electrical conductive adhesives. The aim is to improve the performance of conductive adhesives in comparison to common products. This study deals with characterization of carbon nanotube / epoxy adhesives in electronics packaging. For this study we optimize the CNT - adhesive system by modification of the CNT, use of different dispersion technologies and under variation of the epoxy matrix. The resulting adhesives are characterized by measuring their viscosity, mech- anical strength and their thermal and electrical conductivity. For all studies Multi Wall Nanotubes were used which can be purchased at a reasonable price. For modification of the CNT they can be treated by low pressure plasma (cvd), UV / ozone treatment or modifiedchemically in solution to achieve a higher polarity resulting in a better dispersibility. Also bonding to the polymer matrix is improved. Success of the processes is studied by XPS and REM. For dispersion technology ultrasonic bath, speed mixing and/or treatment with a roll <b>calander</b> can be used. The polymer matrix is also varied in order to achieve an appropriate viscosity at the CNT-content of interest that enables good results in screen printing. Also CNT-polymer interaction can be adapted by varying polarity of the resin used. The distribution of CNT in the matrix is studied by TEM. The first investigations show that ultrasonic finger is the favourable dispersion technology to achieve well dispersed CNT. For modification of the CNT the plasma treatment came out to be efficient to give appropriate amounts of hydroxyl groups...|$|E
40|$|Proteases in Staphylococcal Arthritis Ann-Marie <b>Calander</b> Department of Rheumatology and Inflammation Research, Sahlgrenska Academy, Göteborg University, Guldhedsgatan 10 A, 413 46 Göteborg, Sweden Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a {{ubiquitous}} bacterium. Due to {{an increasing}} prevalence of immunodeficiency {{states in the}} world population {{and the emergence of}} antibiotic resistant strains, the incidence of S. aureus septicaemia and its complications is increasing worldwide, as is the mortality thereof. S. aureus has an impressive capacity to adjust to the environment since it has developed a multitude of invasive and evasive mechanisms to cope with host defence. Many studies have been performed mapping S. aureus virulence determinants with the aim of improving our ability to combat S. aureus infections. So far, little is known concerning the impact of S. aureus extracellular proteases on virulence. The aim of {{the first part of this}} thesis was to investigate the role of bacterial extracellular proteases as potential virulence factors in S. aureus induced septic arthritis. Inherent to this goal was to investigate whether there is a specific immune response to S. aureus extracellular proteases and if so, whether protease specific antibodies have any inhibitory function on the protease activity and thereby modulating the biological properties of the bacteria. The second part of this thesis aimed at shedding light on the impact of a host protease, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP- 9) on the development of septic arthritis. S. aureus strain 8325 - 4 with a known high production of extracellular proteases and its mutants lacking extracellular proteases, Aur-, Ssp- and SspB- were compared concerning their capacity to induce arthritis and to prevail in kidneys and joints. Total serum levels of IgG and IgM were measured, as were antibodies specific for the deleted proteases. Silencing of the ssp, aur, or sspB genes did not affect the clinical nor the histological course of septic arthritis. Polyclonal B-cell activation was illustrated by auto-antibody production and a 10 -fold increase in total IgG and a 50 % increase in total IgM. Specific antibody response was demonstrated since only mice infected with bacteria expressing SspB and V 8 responded with anti-protease specific antibody production. Functional capacity of the specific antibodies was illustrated by the fact that the V 8 protease antibodies inhibited the activity of the enzyme in vitro. To study the production of host protease MMP- 9 over time, zymographic analyses were performed of spleen homogenates at different time points after bacterial inoculation. At day 9 after inoculation there was a four-fold increase of MMP- 9 expression. To further investigate the role of MMP- 9 in infectious arthritis, MMP- 9 KO mice and their littermates C 57 Bl/ 6 wt mice, were inoculated i. v. with S. aureus. MMP- 9 deficient mice showed more clinical arthritis and thrived less well. Importantly, the MMP- 9 KO mice harboured significantly more bacteria in kidneys and joints than did their congenic controls, indicating MMP- 9 as an indispensable molecule in the clearance of the infective agent. Altogether this thesis shows that S. aureus proteases can evoke a specific immune response in the host, but that they are not essential in mediating bacterial arthritis. Furthermore, host MMP- 9 contributes to innate immune responses during septic arthritis.
