Assayers in Washington, D.C. <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> looking that gold ore was from the Coosa Mines because it was “the yellowest gold” submitted and its brilliant color set it apart.|$|E
25|$|Heirens's lawyers {{pressured}} {{him to take}} Tuohy's plea bargain. That deal, {{which was}} the topic of that closed-door meeting with Tuohy, stated that Heirens would serve one life sentence if he confessed to the murders of Josephine Ross, Frances Brown, and Suzanne Degnan. With {{the help of his}} lawyers, he began drafting a confession using the Chicago Tribune article as a guide:As it turned out, the Tribune article was very helpful, as it provided me with a lot of details I didn't know. My attorneys rarely changed anything outright, but I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> their faces if I had made a mistake. Or they would say, 'Now, Bill, is that really the way it happened?' Then I would change my story because, obviously, it went against what was known (in the Tribune).|$|E
500|$|The {{town meeting}} {{attracted}} a packed crowd of over a thousand, with Nixon supporters distributing anti-Voorhis literature at the door. The Senate proxies spoke first for their candidates, followed by Voorhis. Nixon, who had notified organizers {{that he would}} be late due to another commitment, arrived during Voorhis's speech, and remained backstage until the congressman had completed his talk. He then came onstage, shook hands with Voorhis, and delivered a fifteen-minute address. A question-and-answer period then followed, with a Nixon supporter asking Voorhis about his onetime Socialist registration, and about his views on monetary policy. [...] After the representative responded, a Voorhis supporter asked Nixon why he was making [...] "false charges" [...] about the supposed Voorhis CIO-PAC endorsement. [...] In response, Nixon reached into his pocket and pulled out a copy of a Southern California NCPAC bulletin mentioning the group's endorsement of Voorhis. [...] The congressman was unaware of the endorsement; those of his aides in the know had [...] "completely forgotten" [...] to tell him. [...] Nixon walked halfway across the stage and displayed it to Voorhis, asking him to read it for himself. Voorhis came from his seat and took it, and (according to Bullock, who served as timekeeper at the debate) [...] "mumbled" [...] that this seemed to be a different organization from the CIO-PAC. [...] Nixon reclaimed the document, and began to read out names {{of the members of the}} boards of directors of the two groups, [...] "It's the same thing, virtually, when they have the same directors." [...] The crowd began to cheer Nixon, who later wrote, [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> the audience reaction that I had made my point", and to jeer Voorhis, who wrote, [...] "They'd boo and laugh at my remarks, and this disturbed me." ...|$|E

6000|$|He <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> either {{her tone}} or {{expression}} with what anxiety she awaited his reply. [...] "Suppose {{we do something}} exciting, {{like going to the}} movies," [...] he suggested with a laugh.|$|R
6000|$|Eleanor was beckoning Jimmy, but {{the child}} went on. [...] "Well," [...] she said, [...] "he thinks you nice, I know. I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> it <b>by</b> {{the way he looked}} at you. Perhaps you didn't see him, but I did." ...|$|R
2500|$|The March 15 {{meeting was}} held in the [...] "New Building" [...] or [...] "Temple", a 40 by 70 foot (12 by 21 m) {{building}} at the camp. [...] After Gates opened the meeting, Washington entered the building to everyone's surprise. [...] He asked to speak to the officers, and the stunned Gates relinquished the floor. [...] Washington <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> the faces of his officers, who had not been paid for quite some time, that they were quite angry and did not show the respect or deference as they had toward Washington in the past.|$|E
2500|$|The {{gravitational}} constant appears in Newton's law of universal gravitation, {{but it was}} not measured until seventy-one years after Newton's death by Henry Cavendish with his Cavendish experiment, performed in 1798 (Philosophical Transactions 1798). Cavendish measured [...] implicitly, using a torsion balance invented by the geologist Rev. John Michell. He used a horizontal torsion beam with lead balls whose inertia (in relation to the torsion constant) he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> timing the beam's oscillation. Their faint attraction to other balls placed alongside the beam was detectable by the deflection it caused. Cavendish's aim was not actually to measure the {{gravitational constant}}, but rather to measure Earth's density relative to water, through the precise knowledge of the gravitational interaction. [...] In modern units, the density that Cavendish calculated implied a value for [...] of [...]|$|E
2500|$|After {{the attack}} on Peck's ranch the Apaches {{continued}} on towards Sycamore Canyon and the nearby homesteads, some twenty miles south of Arivaca. One of the homesteads was the cattle ranch of John [...] "Yank" [...] Bartlett and his partner Henry [...] "Hank" [...] Hewitt, located {{at the head of}} the canyon. On April 28, the day after the attack at Peck's ranch, a local man named Phil Shanahan was visiting the Bartlett ranch where his ten-year-old son, Little Phil Shanahan, was staying with Johnny Bartlett, the son of Yank Bartlett. Eventually Shanahan decided to ride back to his ranch, a few miles away, leaving his son, Little Phil, at the Bartlett ranch. Shortly after that the boys heard gunfire in the distance and then Shanahan stumbled back into view of the ranch house saying he had been shot. Yank <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> the wound that Shanahan needed a doctor so he told his son Johnny to ride to Oro Blanco to get help and alarm the townspeople. Yank also told Little Phil to go back to his home and warn his mother and his sisters. Phil made it to his house without incident and he took his family into the mountains where they hid until the following day. But, while the Shanahans were in hiding, the raiders attacked their house, stealing food, clothing and killing some cattle. Not long after Johnny left, he discovered three men [...] "dressed in black and acting as if they were drunk." [...] Afraid, Johnny turned around and went back, only to find that the Apaches had arrived and were firing into the house. Johnny rode through the firing to the door of the house, he was not hurt but his horse was wounded and died in the doorway. Yank returned the Apache's fire, while at the same time trying to tend to Shanahan's wound, and received a bullet to one of his shoulders, but he remained conscious and continued to fight. When it was dark, Yank sent Johnny out to ride to Oro Blanco again.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] said John Gayther, {{who had not}} cut a pea-stick for {{the last}} fifteen minutes; [...] "I suppose you <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> their uniforms which one of them belonged to your side--I mean the young lady could not tell?" ...|$|R

60|$|News? Such {{little things}} were news to us. A change of bakers--we <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> it <b>by</b> our bread. What made Pie-face Jones lay off a week? Was it {{vacation}} or sickness?

60|$|Old Man Coyote {{is himself}} a tireless runner. He {{is not so}} heavy as is Bowser, so does not tire as easily. Then, too, he had not wasted his breath as had Bowser with his steady baying. Old Man Coyote <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> the sound of Bowser's voice when the latter was {{beginning}} to grow tired, and he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> {{the fact that he}} often had a moment or two to sit down and rest before Bowser got dangerously near.|$|E

"Before {{you begin}} to tell us your story, young sir, we should be glad {{to know how it}} is that you speak our {{language}} so well; for indeed we <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> your accent that you are not a native of these parts, which is of course impossible, seeing that your father is an Englishman and captain of the ship lying off there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course. I believe you're {{a sort of}} honorary dog yourself. I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> it <b>by</b> the way {{you stopped}} that fight at Roville.

6000|$|For a {{long time}} the Indian {{remained}} silent, and I <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> the expression of his grave face whether my reasoning weighed with him or not; I therefore offered up a brief prayer that the Spirit of God might open his eyes--as well as my own--to see, and our hearts to receive, the truth, whatever that might be. Then I said,--"The thoughts of Big Otter are deep, what do they lead to?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure enough, {{there in}} the {{distance}} war some horsemen coming across the plain; but they war straggling, and not many of them. I could not make head nor tail of it.

60|$|The wail was {{immediately}} {{followed by a}} real scream of terror from the small lungs. Tarzan was electrified into instant action.

He thrust his jaw out sidewise, as his habit is when he pulls, and changed his leg. His voice was hard and heavy, and his ears were close to his big, plain Hambletonian head.|$|R
