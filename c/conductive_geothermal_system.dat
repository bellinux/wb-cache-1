Apparent resistivity maps were derived from the in-phase electric fields.

40|$|In 2013, {{there are}} less than 20 {{documented}} examples of operational <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> on mine sites worldwide. This is surprising, since on remote mine sites, where fuels {{may have to be}} shipped in over great distances, heating and cooling from low-enthalpy geothermal sources may have a significant advantage in operational cost over conventional energy sources. A review of factors affecting the feasibility of <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> on mining projects has been undertaken, and has identified the possible configurations of <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> suitable for the exploration, operational and closure phases of mine development. The geothermal opportunities associated with abandoned or legacy mines are also discussed. The potential categories of heat reservoirs associated with mine sites are: natural ground; backfilled workings; mine waste; dewatering pumping; and flooded workings/pit lakes. The potentially lower operational costs for heating and cooling must be offset against the capital cost of a <b>geothermal</b> <b>system.</b> The focus for mine operators should therefore be on identifying at feasibility stage those projects where conditions are favourable for <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems,</b> the potential risks are understood, the economics are likely to be beneficial, and <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> can be established while minimising additional capital costs...|$|R

40|$|<b>Geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> in the Basin and Range Province of {{the western}} United States {{probably}} differ in many respects from <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> already discovered {{in other parts of}} the world because of the unique tectonic setting. To investigate this, a study of the geothermal occurrences at Fly Ranch, approximately 100 miles north of Reno, Nevada, has been undertaken. Ample evidence for a <b>geothermal</b> <b>system</b> exists in this area, including the surface expression of heat flow in the form of hot springs, an extensive area of low electrical resistivity, and a high level of seismicity along faults bounding the thermal area.

40|$|The tectonic and magmatic {{framework}} of southeast Oregon provides the conditions {{necessary for the}} existence of geothermal energy resources. However, few detailed studies of <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> {{in this part of the}} Basin and Range have been conducted. Young bimodal magmatism and faulting associated with the High Lava Plains coupled with the encroachment of the Basin and Range tectonic province and potentially the Walker Lane have created the structural configuration, heat source, and secondary permeability necessary for <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> in southeast Oregon. The relative contribution of these provinces to the overall tectonomagmatic framework is less well understood. In this study, the <b>geothermal</b> <b>system</b> near Paisley, Oregon has been characterized by a detailed regional heat flow study, geologic mapping, aqueous geochemical analysis, a gravity survey, and a X-ray diffraction analysis of secondary alteration minerals. Based on these analyses, the Paisley <b>geothermal</b> <b>system</b> shares many aspects similar to Basin and Range <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems.</b> Geologic mapping has revealed a sequence of rocks with ages spanning from the mid Eocene-Present as well as structures related to the Basin and Range Province. A structural transfer zone connects two en-echelon normal faults in Summer Lake Basin, which controls the upwelling of thermal waters. The fault controlling fluid flow in the Paisley <b>geothermal</b> <b>system</b> was imaged using a gravity survey. Thermal water in the Paisley <b>geothermal</b> <b>system</b> has been determined to be of meteoric source, and is interpreted to be of Pleistocene age based on stable isotopes having average values of - 119. 59 ‰ and - 14. 18 ‰ for δD and δ 18 O, respectively. Recharge to the thermal aquifer is driven dominantly by topographic flow, with residence times on the order of 1000 s of years. Aqueous geochemistry was used to determine that the Paisley <b>geothermal</b> <b>system</b> is not magmatic in origin, with low values of magmatic SO 4, As, B, and high values of HCO 3 and Na. Geothermometers were used to calculate reservoir temperatures between 95 °C – 166 °C. These results were independently checked by X-ray diffraction studies of alteration mineral assemblages in reservoir rocks from two production wells drilled by Surprise Valley Electrification, which revealed similar temperatures for the stability field of mineral assemblages present in the wells. Because it has been determined that the Paisley geothermal fluids are not influenced by recent magmatism, the role of bimodal magmatism associated with the High Lava Plains on <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> in southeastern Oregon appears to be minimal. However, in areas where magmatism is younger than 2 million years, this may not be true. Like the <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> of the western Great Basin, the location of <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> in southeast Oregon is highly dependent on the regional structural architecture. Also similar to some <b>geothermal</b> <b>systems</b> of the Basin and Range, the source of water is not modern meteoric water, but is “fossil” water, which implies that production must be managed carefully to create a sustainable resource...|$|R

The modeled reservoir consists of three homogeneous segments: the cap rock and (vapor- and liquid-dominated) reservoir rock, which are crosscut by fault zones initiating vertical fluid flow.
