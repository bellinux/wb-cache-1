40|$|Hydro One, a major {{distribution}} of electricity in Ontario, has reported that approximately 16, 000 of the wood utility poles in its network of two million poles have been damaged by woodpeckers. With a cost of replacement of approximately $ 4000 per pole, replacing all affected poles is an expensive enterprise. Previous research conducted at UW attempted to quantify how different levels of woodpecker damage affected the pole strength. In {{the course of this}} research, some shear failures were observed. Utility poles being slender cantilevered structures, failures in shear are not expected. The objectives of this study were to determine the effective shear strength of wood utility poles and to determine the reliability of wood utility poles under different configurations, including poles that had been damaged by woodpeckers. An experimental programme was developed and conducted to determine the effective shear strength of wood poles. Red Pine wood pole stubs were used for this purpose. The stubs were slotted with two transverse half-depth cuts parallel to one another but with openings in opposite directions. A shear plane was formed between these two slots. The specimens were loaded longitudinally and the failure load was recorded and divided by the failure plane area to determine the shear strength. The moisture content of each specimen was recorded and used to normalize each data point to 12 % moisture content. The experimental study showed that the mean shear strength of the Red Pine specimens adjusted to 12 % moisture content was 2014 kPa (COV 47. 5 %) when calculated using gross shear area, and 2113 kPa (COV 40. 5 %) when calculated using net area. The shear strength of full-size pole specimens can be represented using a log-normal distribution with a scale parameter of λ = 0. 5909 and a shape parameter of ζ = 0. 5265. iii The reliability of Red Pine wood utility poles was determined analytically. A structural analysis model was developed using Visual Basic for Applications in Excel and used in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulation. Statistical distribution parameters for wind loads and ice accretion for the Thunder Bay, Ontario region were obtained from literature. Similarly, statistical data were obtained for the modulus of rupture and shear strength from previous research conducted at UW as well as the experimental programme conducted in this research. The effects of various properties on reliability were tested parametrically. Tested parameters included the height of poles above ground, <b>construction</b> <b>grade,</b> end- of-life criterion, and various levels of woodpecker damage. To evaluate the results of the analysis, the calculated reliability levels were compared to the annual reliability level of 98 % suggested in CAN/CSA-C 22. 3 No. 60826. Results of this reliability study showed that taller poles tend to have lower reliability than shorter ones, likely due to second-order effects having a greater influence on taller poles. The <b>Construction</b> <b>Grade,</b> a factor which dictates the load factors used during design, has {{a significant impact on the}} reliability of wood utility pole, with poles designed using <b>Construction</b> <b>Grade</b> 3 having a reliability level below the 98 % threshold. Poles designed based on <b>Construction</b> <b>Grade</b> 2 and 3 having reached the end-of-life criterion (60 % remaining strength) had reliability below this threshold whilst CG 1 -designed pole reliability remained above it. Wood poles with exploratory- and feeding-level woodpecker damage were found to have an acceptable level of reliability. Those with nesting-level damage had reliability below the suggested limits. Poles with feeding and nesting damage showed an increase in shear failure. The number of observed shear failure depended on the orientation of the damage. Woodpecker damage with the opening oriented with the neutral axis (i. e., the opening perpendicular to the direction of loading) produced a greater number of shear failure compared to woodpecker damage oriented with the extreme bending fibres...|$|E

50|$|A main {{threat to}} the species is the loss and {{disturbance}} of its cedar glade habitat. About 50% of the region's cedar glades have been lost since European settlement, and remaining glades are fragmented and altered by grazing, cultivation, and residential development. Many are affected by activity related to roadways, such as herbicides, road <b>construction,</b> <b>grading,</b> trash dumping, and off-road vehicles. Modified glades no longer maintain themselves through the natural processes of drought, wildfire, and erosion, and the openings shrink as woody vegetation closes in. The sunny open spots required by the plant are reduced.

ABSTRACT: High Strength Low Alloy (HSLA) steels were developed primarily for the automotive industry to replace low-carbon steels {{in order to improve}} the strength-to-weight ratio and meet the need for higher-strength <b>construction</b> <b>grade</b> materials. During this period, micro-alloyed or HSLA steels became an indispensable class for different applications like automobile industry, ship building, line pipe, pressure vessels, building construction, bridges, and storage tanks. Different welding techniques are used in this study to evaluate the mechanical properties of weldments of HSLA steel. Weldments are prepared using three welding processes such as shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), flux cored arc welding (FCAW) and friction stir welding (FSW). Friction stir welding (FSW) is a solid state technology that has attracted considerable interest since it was invented at TWI in 1991. Structural integrity issues in welding of HSLA steels are associated with different problems encountered in friction stir welding of these steels. The other important problem in welding HSLA steels is to prevent brittle fracture of welded joints due to increased strength of HSLA steels. The solid state characteristics of FSW eliminate the susceptibility of porosity and cracking. The objective is to determine the best welding process for HSLA steel by evaluatin...|$|E
40|$|Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) {{has been}} the most common {{forestry}} species in UK plantations for many decades. It is generally fast grown in short rotation, which has implications for quality. The harvested timber has a number of end-use applications. Of these, sawn <b>construction</b> <b>grade</b> timber is at the high end of market value. Currently, under one third of home grown sawn timber processed by sawmills achieves the required C 16 or higher grading for construction class timber. Presently there is significant standing stock of 40 years old or under. Improvements in timber quality would create significant benefits for growers and processors. Distortion in kiln dried sawn timber is a considerable barrier to improving grading classification and marketability. Twist in particular accounts for around six percent of the rejections after kiln drying. Additional twist when timber dries further; in storage, at construction sites or in-service, is perceived as a marketing issue. The focus of this work was to better understand the evolution of twist during the drying process and seek to improve quality by examining the key properties in sawn timber that contribute to the formation of twist. Samples of regularly processed full size (3 m in length) sawn timber were kiln dried with no restraint to promote maximum twist. This was done in three stages {{to assess the impact of}} intermittent drying. Measurements of twist, moisture content, acoustic velocity and basic dimensions were taken before and after each drying cycle. The results showed highly significant differences between battens containing the pith and those that did not. Drying in stages did not seem to affect the linearity of the moisture content against twist relationship. Twist was seen to develop at a consistent rate throughout the process regardless of the final amount of twist accrued or the position from which the batten was sawn. Where timber is likely to dry to lower moisture content after sale it is therefore possible to predict the additional twist from the moisture content expected and allow for it by stricter grading than the twist standard demands. Twist was seen to decrease slightly during a lengthy period of storage in controlled conditions between drying cycles. This may allude to a relaxation effect which could have implications for timber distortion in-service but this would require a more extensive study before any such conclusions could be drawn. A second batch of unrelated samples, were kiln dried to 12...|$|E
