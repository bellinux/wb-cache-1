5|$|The Army {{also tried}} to control poaching. In 1896, acting Superintendent Colonel S. B. M. Young stopped issuing firearm permits after {{discovering}} {{that large numbers of}} game and fish were being killed. Poaching <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> issue in the 21st century. The Army's administration of the park ended in 1914.|$|E

In 2006 a new freight park, known as the 3MG Mersey Multimodal Gateway, was opened in the West Bank area of the town. This provides a link for freight arriving by road, air or sea to be transferred to the rail network. It is expected to create up to 5,000 new jobs.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 20th century, heart disease had surpassed {{infectious}} disease as {{the leading cause of death}} in the United States, and it is currently the leading cause of deaths worldwide. Since 1948, the ongoing Framingham Heart Study has shed light on the effects of various influences on the heart, including diet, exercise, and common medications such as aspirin. Although the introduction of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers has improved the management of chronic heart failure, the disease <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> enormous medical and societal burden, with 30 to 40% of patients dying within a year of receiving the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The Adour was {{developed}} into both afterburning and non-afterburning models; the BAE Hawk, which had beaten the Jaguar {{to fulfill the}} Air Staff Target 362 trainer requirement, also adopted the non-afterburning Adour engine developed for the Jaguar. The Adour engine found use in several aircraft abroad, such as the McDonnell Douglas T-45 Goshawk, the Mitsubishi T-2, and the Mitsubishi F-1(which resembles the Jaguar). Even following the Jaguar's retirement in Europe, the Adour <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> active product with new variants being developed. As of February 2013, the Indian Air Force was considering fitting 125 Jaguars with new Honeywell F125IN engines.|$|E

5|$|The Pennsylvania Ministerium {{remained}} a constituent {{church of the}} General Council from 18671918. In 1918, following {{the celebration of the}} 400th anniversary of the Reformation, the three Lutheran church bodies of Eastern America (The General Synod, the General SynodSouth, and the General Council) reunited to form the United Lutheran Church in America. This event, while marking a watershed of unity among American Lutherans, also marked the end of the Pennsylvania Ministerium. The ULCA would later join with other American Lutherans, in 1962 in the Lutheran Church in America, and in 1988 in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (which <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> active church body and is a direct descendant of the Pennsylvania Ministerium).|$|E
5|$|As decolonisation {{proceeded}} {{throughout the}} British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather {{continued to use}} it as independent countries setting their own language policies. For example, the view of the English language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> official language of India. English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK. However English is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent English in India. David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who speak or understand English than {{any other country in the}} world, but the number of English speakers in India is very uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{and high}} tech {{research}} and development operations {{are located in the}} city, including the Lowell Observatory, Northern Arizona University, the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS) and the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) Flagstaff campus. Lowell Observatory <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> active astronomical observatory and a popular visitors center which hosts educational displays and tours. It has a distributed network of small telescopes which together create images of celestial bodies with much higher resolutions than any other single telescope can produce. Current research is involved in observations of near-Earth phenomena such as asteroids and comets. The observatory is also involved in a $30 million project with the Discovery Channel to build the Discovery Channel Telescope, a sophisticated, ground-based telescope with advanced optical capabilities for future projects. Lowell Observatory and NOFS are also collaborators on the major project, the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer, on nearby Anderson Mesa. NOFS is heavily involved with the science of star catalogs and astrometry, or the positions and distances of stars and celestial objects.|$|E

5|$|The Addolorata Society {{was started}} {{by a group of}} women parishioners in 1903 and <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> all-women society. The goal of the group is to find better ways to serve the church. The symbol of the Addolorata Society is the Blessed Mother because she symbolizes love. A member becomes a free life member when she turns eighty, as long as she has a member for at least fifteen years prior to her eightieth birthday. Some of their events include {{attending}} funeral Masses and collecting money to purchase altar linens, vestments, and altar lights. The presidents of the society since 1903 in chronological order are as follows: Mrs. Rose Spinelli, Mrs. Michelina Fragale, Mrs. Maria Greco, Mrs. Rose Pascuzzi, Mrs. Santa Bordonaro, Mrs. Anna Bordonaro, Mrs. Sabetta, Mrs. Carmina Chirella, Georgeanne Stearman, and Sandy Laney.|$|E
