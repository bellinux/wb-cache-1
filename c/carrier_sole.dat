40|$|In this study, {{we tested}} a new {{approach}} to facilitate the application of white rot fungi (WRF) under non-sterile conditions, by introducing grain sorghum as <b>carrier</b> and <b>sole</b> carbon and nutrient source for WRF. To this end, Trametes versicolor was immobilized on sorghum, and its ability to remove humic acid (HA) from synthetic and real industrial wastewater was studied. HA removal was measured as colour reduction and also analysed via size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Under sterile conditions, 80 % colour removal was achieved for both synthetic and real wastewater using immobilized WRF on sorghum, without adding any additional carbon or nutrient sources. Under non-sterile conditions, immobilized fungi could again remove 80 % of the colour and reached a maximum of 40 U/L laccase activity. In contrast, non-immobilized fungi cultivated in non-sterile wastewater supplemented with additional nutrients, reached only 10 % decolourization and maximum 5 U/L laccase activity. SEC analysis showed that bioremoval of HA by WRF was associated with degradation of HA. Finally, immobilized fungi were used to treat real wastewater, under non-sterile conditions, in a sequential batch order without renewing the immobilized fungi. Four batch feedings were conducted and 80 %, 70 %, 50 % and 40 % colour removal was achieved for each batch, respectively, over a total incubation period of 19 days. </p...|$|R

5000|$|On January 1, 2003, TNT {{launched}} a substitute feed called TNT Plus, {{although it does}} not appear this was ever reflected in the channel's on-air identity.

In theory, TNT Plus was to have been the <b>sole</b> <b>carrier</b> of Turner's NBA and NASCAR coverage from that point forward, while any providers still carrying the original TNT would have seen replacement programming instead.

3000|$|In {{contrast}} to conventional superconductors, the physical properties of organic superconductors directly reflect the electronic {{structure of the}} molecules they consist. Inabe et al. have first reported the thermoelectric power of single crystal K 3 C 60 and Rb 3 C 60 superconductors [10]. Nonlinear temperature dependences of S(T) with negative sign are documented above Tc for both K- and Rb-doped fullerides. The room-temperature value of S(T) is about − 11 μV/K, indicating the metallic nature in the normal state with electron as <b>sole</b> <b>carriers.</b> The absolute value of S decreases linearly until it drops discontinuously to zero at T c [...] and at a broad hump around 70 K. The analysis of density of states in K 3 C 60 reveals that low-frequency phonon modes are significant in normal state transport, and the nonlinear behavior in low-temperature regime (T < 70 K) is ascribed to phonon drag.|$|R

40|$|Answers to the title&#x 2032;s {{question}} {{have been}} influenced by a history in which an early science of consciousness was rejected by behaviourists on the argument that this entails commitment to ontological dualism and "free will" in the sense of indeterminism.

Nevertheless, a legacy within computational and information-processing views of mind rejects or de-emphasises a role for consciousness.

40|$|We compare {{different}} {{treatments of}} the constraints in canonical quantum gravity.

Quantization of the constraints in both the Dirac and ADM square root Hamiltonian approaches leads to the well known problems of time evolution. These problems of time are of both an interpretational and technical nature. In contrast, the geometrodynamic quantization procedure on the superspace of the true dynamical variables separates the issues of quantization from {{the enforcement of the}} constraints. The resulting theory takes into account states that are off-shell with respect to the constraints, and thus avoids the problems of time. We develop, for the first time, the geometrodynamic quantization formalism in a general setting and show that it retains all essential features previously illustrated in the context of homogeneous cosmologies...|$|R

50|$|For {{numerous}} reasons, in {{the opinion}} of US naval aviation historian Richard K. Smith, the Akron never got the chance to show what she was capable of. Initially, the idea had been to use her as a scout for the fleet (just as the German Navy zeppelins had been used during World War I), with her airplanes being simply useful auxiliaries, capable of extending her range of vision or of defending her against attacking enemy aircraft. Gradually, {{in the minds of the}} more forward-thinking officers familiar with airship and scouting fleet operations, this was reversed: she and the Macon came to be regarded as aircraft <b>carriers,</b> whose <b>sole</b> job was to get the scouting airplanes to the search area and then to support them in their flights. The mothership herself should stay in the background, out of sight of enemy surface units, merely acting as a mobile advanced base for the airplanes which should do all the actual searching. Any aircraft carrier could do this but only an airship could do it so quickly: her speed was at least twice that of a surface ship, enabling her to get to the scene or be switched from flank to flank quickly. But this was an experimental ship, a prototype, and it took time for this doctrine and suitable tactics to evolve. It also took time to develop the techniques of navigating, controlling and coordinating the scouts. At first, developments were hampered by inadequate radio equipment and by the difficulties encountered by the scout pilots in navigating, scouting and communicating from their cramped, open cockpits.|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundCurrent {{diagnostic}} tests are inadequate to detect typhoid cases, {{as well as}} the chronic <b>carrier</b> state, the <b>sole</b> reservoir of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. The current study was conducted to find new molecular signatures of pathogen/disease to understand the mechanism behind the host–pathogen interaction in enteric fever. MethodsProteomics-based studies were done to determine the expression of differentially expressed proteins in the plasma of controls, acute typhoid cases, and chronic typhoid carriers. Further, transcriptome-based analysis using reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was done in controls, acute typhoid cases, and chronic typhoid carriers. ResultsResults showed the upregulation of proprotein convertase subtilisin, furin, haptoglobin, and albumin in the plasma of chronic typhoid carriers. The elevation in mRNA expression of four differentially expressed proteins confirms the changes at the transcriptional level. Further, the increase in albumin and haptoglobin in chronic typhoid carriers shows their role in free radical generation, inflammation, and monocyte cell signaling. ConclusionThrough proteomics techniques, this study identified four proteins in the chronic typhoid carrier host that may have a role in the disease pathogenesis of enteric fever...|$|R

40|$|In their article 2 ̆ 2 Intermediality as Cultural Literacy and Teaching the Graphic Novel 2 ̆ 2 Geert Vandermeersche and Ronald Soetaert {{argue for}} the {{inclusion}} of the graphic novel for the teaching of cultural literacy and literature. As the printed book is no longer the <b>sole</b> <b>carrier</b> of cultural literacy, Vandermeersche and Soetaert postulate that literary culture must be repositioned in intermedial culture and practices. In order to do so, Vandermeersche and Soetaert apply Werner Wolf 2 ̆ 7 s typology of intermediality, aspects of narratology, and scholarship about comics. Following a theoretical discussion they analyze the graphic novel series The Unwritten, a text that thematizes the intermedial nature of (Western) culture today and mediates the function of literature and cultural literacy. Consequently, as Vandermeersche 2 ̆ 7 s and Soetaert 2 ̆ 7 s analysis suggests, narration incorporates references to and the thematization of other media and literary texts, which, in turn, creates embedded stories that try to link the entire fabric of literary culture together.

40|$|Kinesthesia is {{the sense}} of limb movement. It is {{fundamental}} to efficient motor control, yet its neurophysiological components remain poorly understood. The contributions of primary muscle spindles and cutaneous afferents to the kinesthetic sense have been well studied; however, potential contributions from muscle sensory group responses that are different than the muscle spindles have not been ruled out. Electrophysiological recordings in peripheral nerves and brains of male Sprague Dawley rats with a degloved forelimb preparation provide evidence of a rapidly adapting muscle sensory group response that overlaps with vibratory inputs known to generate illusionary perceptions of limb movement in humans (kinesthetic illusion). This group was characteristically distinct from type Ia muscle spindle fibers, the receptor historically attributed to limb movement sensation, suggesting that type Ia muscle spindle fibers may not be the <b>sole</b> <b>carrier</b> of kinesthetic information. The sensory-neural structure of muscles is complex {{and there are a number}} of possible sources for this response group; with Golgi tendon organs being the most likely candidate. The rapidly adapting muscle sensory group response projected to proprioceptive brain regions, the rodent homolog of cortical area 3 a and the second somatosensory area (S 2), with similar adaption and frequency response profiles between the brain and peripheral nerves. Their representational organization was muscle-specific (myocentric) and magnified for proximal and multi-articulate limb joints. Projection to proprioceptive brain areas, myocentric representational magnification of muscles prone to movement error, overlap with illusionary vibrational input, and resonant frequencies of volitional motor unit contraction suggest that this group response may be involved with limb movement processing...|$|R
40|$|Title of the paper: Biotechnical {{control of}} {{reproduction}} in sows {{and the opportunity}} of a hidden change of gene frequency for estrous behaviour Since {{more than three decades}} hormones have been used for the synchronisation of ovulation in sows often combined with timed artificial insemination. This will be done without considering the estrous behaviour. A selection with regard to symptoms of standing behaviour is not necessary. Regarding to {{that it is possible to}} breed pigs that are not suitable for that purpose. The aim of this study was to examine the opportunity of hidden gene frequency changes in the genetics of pigs in two herds of German Landrace. This will be shown by the example of the standing behaviour and especially the time they need to come in heat after weaning of the piglets. The basic datas was provided by two pig-breeding farms. The calculation is based only on the information to the 2 nd and 3 rd litter of these sows in order to reduce the influence of selection. It is assumed that the path of heredity is monofacturial. Only pigs with the genotype “aa” will be negatively affected. At the beginning the father of boars (SS) is the <b>sole</b> <b>carrier</b> of the defect gene. The gene frequency, frequency for homozygotes and the correct number of concerned pigs after 10 generations will be calculated for a more accurate description of the expansion of this gene. The gene frequency results in the balance of 0. 4 %. This figure has already been achieved after eight generations. According to this value the frequency of homozygotes is 0. 0017 % on all paths of heredity. After ten generations the population will contain 0. 0093 animals of the homozygot recessive genotype “aa”. There will be 0. 0055 male and 0. 0038 female pigs of the negative genotype. Finally, no negative effect of the usage of hormones for the synchronisation of ovulation in pigs has been proved...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of wildlife tourism {{has been dominated}} by ideologies informed by western colonialism and its values of nature. These ideologies, made transparent through communicative and interpretative discourses, influence the way management policies and practices are devised and enacted. The inherent scientific and utilitarian views are supported by a doctrine of separation. This is apparent in the dualism posed, and enacted, between nature and culture that sees humans as being the <b>sole</b> <b>carriers</b> of culture that separates them from the uncultured and uncivilised world of nature into which all other animals, and certainly untamed wildlife, belong. It justifies the use of non-humans for human purposes and continues to allow us to treat non-human animals and other forms of nature in often abominable ways. This thesis investigates two situations in which wildlife tourism occurs in Australia. Fraser Island and Penguin Island are two wildlife tourism destinations {{on opposite sides of the}} continent with very different wildlife but some very similar issues. From these two contexts data was collected through interviews, focus groups, participant observation, and from literary and documentary sources. Understanding the empirical data collected from these case studies is facilitated through a social constructionist view of discourse analysis that allows an unpacking of the messages and a stance from which to challenge the dominant ideologies that frame management and interaction. In the thesis I demonstrate that anthropology, in its incarnation as environmental anthropology and as a team player in a necessarily interdisciplinary approach to understanding and resolving environmental issues, has much to offer. This engagement has the potential to enhance not only the sustainable future of naturebased activities like wildlife tourism but also the relevance of anthropology in the postcolonial contemporary world. The need for a holistic framework encompassing all the stakeholders in any wildlife tourism venture is proposed. This approach to wildlife tourism is best serviced by examining perspectives, values and concerns of all members of the wildlife tourism community at any given destination. It is only through this type of holistic and situated focus that we can hope to effectively understand, and then manage, in the best interests of all parties. More specifically, and finally, I argue for a rethinking of the way wildlife tourism interactions are managed in some settings. The ideology of separation, enacted both conceptually and physically to create maintain boundaries, is demonstrated through the two case studies and the ways in which interactions between humans and wildlife are currently managed. An alternative is posed, that by reconstructing management in settings where wildlife tourists may be more accepting of their own responsibility towards nature, a model can be developed that allows people and wildlife to co-exist without ‘killing’ the natural instincts of either...|$|R
