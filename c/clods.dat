25|$|Early steel ploughs, {{like those}} for {{thousands}} of years prior, were walking ploughs, directed by the ploughman holding onto handles {{on either side of the}} plough. The steel ploughs were so much easier to draw through the soil that the constant adjustments of the blade to react to roots or <b>clods</b> was no longer necessary, as the plough could easily cut through them. Consequently, it was not long after that the first riding ploughs appeared. On these, wheels kept the plough at an adjustable level above the ground, while the ploughman sat on a seat; whereas, with earlier ploughs the ploughman would have had to walk. Direction was now controlled mostly through the draught team, with levers allowing fine adjustments. This led very quickly to riding ploughs with multiple mouldboards, dramatically increasing ploughing performance.|$|E
40|$|<b>Clod</b> {{crushing}} is {{a principal}} problem with soils of high clay content. Therefore, {{there is a need}} for determining the conditions for <b>clod</b> breaking and <b>clod</b> crushing. The objective of the work was to develop a special purpose tool for single <b>clod</b> breaking both by rigid support of the <b>clod</b> and by a single <b>clod</b> supported by soil and to develop a machine for <b>clod</b> crushing. Furthermore, the purpose was to determine the relationship between the specific energy requirement for <b>clod</b> crushing in the function of soil plasticity and the soil moisture content by the means of the developed tool and machine. The main result of the experiments is summarized in a 3 D diagram where the specific energy requirement for soil <b>clod</b> crushing is given in the function of the moisture content and the plasticity index for different clay soils...|$|R

500|$|No {{systematic}} {{studies have}} been done on the diet of the black currawong, but it is known to be omnivorous, feeding {{on a wide variety of}} foodstuffs including insects and small vertebrates, carrion, and berries. [...] Birds forage on the ground most often, but also in tree canopies. They use their bills to probe the ground or turn over <b>clods</b> of earth or small rocks looking for food. Birds have been seen using walking tracks to forage along. A group of ten birds were observed trying to break open ice on a frozen lake. They have been recorded foraging along the beach for fly larvae in beached kelp. Most commonly, black currawongs forage in pairs, but they may congregate in larger groups—flocks of 100 birds have descended on orchards to eat apples or rotten fruit. The species has been observed in a mixed-species flocks with forest ravens (Corvus tasmanicus), and silver gulls (Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae), white-faced herons (Egretta novaehollandiae), white-fronted chats (Epthianura albifrons), and European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) on the beach at Sundown Point. They have been observed securing dead larger prey to ease subsequent dismemberment; a parent currawong had wedged a dead chicken's wings under a log to facilitate pulling off portions such as legs and entrails to feed to its young, and another time hooked a dead rabbit on a spur of a log to rip it into pieces.|$|E

2500|$|The size {{distribution}} of {{gravel and sand}} particles are typically measured using sieve analysis. The formal procedure is described in ASTM D6913-04(2009). A stack of sieves with accurately dimensioned holes between a mesh of wires is used to separate the particles into size bins. A known volume of dried soil, with <b>clods</b> broken down to individual particles, is put {{into the top of}} a stack of sieves arranged from coarse to fine. The stack of sieves is shaken for a standard period of time so that the particles are sorted into size bins. This method works reasonably well for particles in the sand and gravel size range. [...] Fine particles tend to stick to each other, and hence the sieving process is not an effective method. If {{there are a lot of}} fines (silt and clay) present in the soil it may be necessary to run water through the sieves to wash the coarse particles and <b>clods</b> through.|$|E

Parts support was decent, but parts and hopups were in lower supply due to Kyosho's lack of a dedicated distributor.

2500|$|By 1895, Henri {{had come}} to reconsider his earlier love of Impressionism, calling it a [...] "new academicism." [...] He was urging his friends and proteges to create a new, more {{realistic}} art that would speak directly to their own time and experience. [...] He {{believed that it was}} the right moment for American painters to seek out fresh, less genteel subjects in the modern American city. [...] The paintings by Henri, Sloan, Glackens, Luks, Shinn, and others of their acquaintance that were inspired by this outlook eventually came to be called the Ashcan School of American art. [...] They spurned academic painting and Impressionism as an art of mere surfaces. [...] Art critic Robert Hughes declared that, [...] "Henri wanted art to be akin to journalism. [...] He wanted paint to be as real as mud, as the <b>clods</b> of horse-shit and snow, that froze on Broadway in the winter, as real a human product as sweat, carrying the unsurpressed smell of human life." [...] Ashcan painters began to attract public attention in the same decade in which the realist fiction of Stephen Crane, Theodore Dreiser, and Frank Norris was finding its audience and the muckraking journalists were calling attention to slum conditions.|$|E

[...] May it be pleasing before you, Lord, our God and God of our fathers, that a decree of want not be issued against us, not this day or this year, but if a decree of want should be issued against us, then let it be a want because of the performance of religious duties. [...] May it be pleasing before you, Lord, our God and God of our fathers, that this year be a year of cheap food, full bellies, good business; a year in which the earth forms <b>clods,</b> then is parched so as to form scabs, and then moistened with dew, so that your people, Israel, will not be in need of the help of one another. [...] And do not heed the prayer of travelers that it not rain.” The Rabbis of Caesarea added, “And concerning your people, Israel, that they not exercise dominion over one another.” And for {{the people who live in}} the Sharon plain he would say this prayer, “May it be pleasing before you, Lord, our God and God of our fathers, that our houses not turn into our graves.”.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Clod</b> and The Pebble is the {{exemplification}} of Blake's statement at {{the beginning}} of Songs of Innocence and of Experience that it is the definition of the [...] "Contrary States of the Human Soul." [...] It shows two contrary types of love. The poem is written in three stanzas. The first stanza is the <b>clod's</b> view that love should be unselfish. The soft view of love is represented by this soft <b>clod</b> of clay, and represents the innocent state of the soul, and a childlike view of the world. The second stanza connects the <b>clod</b> and the pebble. It gives the location of the <b>clod,</b> pleasantly singing his view while being trodden on by a cattle. At the end of the 2nd line the shift in views is signaled by a semicolon. This shift is further emphasized {{with the use of the}} word [...] "But" [...] {{at the beginning}} of the third line. The pebble is meanwhile in the river warbling his view. The final stanza is the pebble's view of selfish love, and it is set up in a parallel structure to the <b>clod's</b> stanza on unselfish love.|$|R
