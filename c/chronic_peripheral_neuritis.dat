40|$|Recombinant (r) outer surfaceproteins (Osp) A and B, {{flagellin}}, and an immunogenicregion of flagellin (41 -G) from Borrelia burgdorferi {{were evaluated}} using immunoblot and ELISA for usefulnessas substrates in diagnostictesting for Lymedisease. Antibodiesto rOspA, rOspB, and r-flagellin were detected by immunoblot and ELISA using the recombinant proteins. Patients with late disease responded to rOspA, rOspB, and r-flagellin, or only to r-flagellin, whereas patients with early disease showed no response or responded only to r-flagellin, Patients who developedantibodies to r-flagellin also responded to 41 -G. The data suggestthat recombinantB. burgdorferi antigens can serveas substrates for immunoblot and ELISA, whichmaybe helpful in diagnosing Lyme disease. Lyme {{disease is a}} tickborne infection caused by the spiro-chete Borrelia burgdorferi. The illness typically evolves in stages, beginning with erythema migrans and progressing through a stage of dissemination during which secondary skin lesions, carditis, meningitis, cranial neuritis, and inter-mittent arthritis can occur to a <b>chronic</b> stage with <b>peripheral</b> <b>neuritis</b> and persistent arthritis [I]. The diagnosis of Lyme disease is based on clinical history and physical findings; how-ever, {{in the absence of}} erythema migrans, the diagnosis can be difficult and laboratory tests may be needed for confirma-tion. ELISAs and immunoblots using whole organisms to mea-sure serologic immune responses to B. burgdorferi antigens are the most widely used tests, but specificity and sensitivity have varied widely [2, 3]. False-positive results can occur due to the presence of rheumatoid factor or antibody to other spirochetes, including those causing syphilis and periodontal disease [4 - 6].

This complication is normally rare when small dosages of the drug are used, but a hig incidence of the neuropathy has recently been observed in East Africa in a group of malnourished truberculous patients receiving isoniazid in comparatively low dosage (4 - 6 mg/kg body-weight daily). The present paper reports on 20 cases of <b>peripheral</b> <b>neuritis</b> encountered in Madras, India, among 338 poorly nourished tuberculous patients during a trial of four isoniazid regimens, two of low and two of high dosage (3. 9 - 5. 5 and 7. 8 - 9. 6 mg/kg bodyweight daily respectively). Nineteen of the 20 cases occurred in the two groups of patients receiving the high dosage and these 19 patients were found to have a higher mean serum level of free isoniazid than the patients in the same groups who did not develop the complication.

50|$|Peter Bostock {{was among}} several licensees {{in this area}} of Manchester who were {{suspected}} of unknowingly selling adulterated beer in 1900. The poisoned beer resulted in outbreaks of <b>peripheral</b> <b>neuritis</b> caused by arsenic poisoning that was traced by the Royal Commission to the raw materials found in brewing sugars at a refiners in Liverpool called Bostock & Co. of Garston (not thought to be a relation of the licensee). The company used a process involving sulphuric acid (made from arsenical iron pyrites) to manufacture glucose. Upon these findings, the Royal Commission recommended that 'a legal maximum of not more than one-hundredth of a grain of arsenic per gallon of liquid per pound of solid food be enforced'. By this point the damage had been done and up to four grains of arsenic were being found per pound of brewing sugar.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{whether there is}} an association between <b>chronic</b> <b>peripheral</b> neuropathy and coeliac disease. Methods: The cause of <b>chronic</b> <b>peripheral</b> neuropathy was first investigated in a group of 478 patients. Published reports were then examined systematically for an association between <b>chronic</b> <b>peripheral</b> neuropathy and coeliac disease. Cases were divided into two groups: group A, polyneuropathy preceding duodenal biopsy and controls undergoing duodenal biopsies; group B, coeliac disease preceding polyneuropathy. Patients with cerebellar ataxia, small fibre neuropathy, or a cause for their neuropathy were excluded. Results: In 425 of the 478 patients, a cause other than coeliac disease was established. In the patients with no determined cause for neuropathy, one had abnormally increased IgA antigliadin antibodies but duodenal biopsy was normal. Ten previous studies of patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>peripheral</b> neuropathies were reviewed. The incidence of biopsy proven coeliac disease in patients with polyneuropathy did not differ from the controls (group A). In patients with a proven coeliac disease (group B), polyneuropathy could not be diagnosed more often than in the general population.

In this study, we compared the response rate (RR), overall survival (OS), and toxicity of the combined chemotherapy regimen of liposomal paclitaxel plus cisplatin (LP) with those of TP as first-line treatments for advanced NSCLC. Methods A total of 100 patients were randomly selected to be treated with liposomal paclitaxel or paclitaxel at a dose of 150 mg/m 2 on day 1 plus cisplatin at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 2 per cycle every 21 days. Results All 100 patients were eligible. The median progression free survival was 5. 1 months vs 4. 2 months, the median OS was 9. 0 months vs 9. 3 months, and RR was 26 % vs 24 % in the LP and TP arms, respectively. No significant difference was observed (P= 0. 110, 0. 342 and 0. 890, respectively).
