40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{highlight}} some perspectives of Teacher Education in the North, especially connected to <b>cultural</b> <b>diversities</b> and the richness of the Sámi Schools in Sweden. Minorities and immigrants are almost invisible in the documents. Indigenous based education can evaluate experiences from the attempts to define and implement education in terms of a curriculum interpreted on the base of the national curriculum. The lack of experience in the educational decision making due to the Sámi culture and the discontinuity between school culture and community culture is obvious. <b>Cultural</b> <b>diversities</b> as well as dilemmas with language are often seen as obstacles. Development of culturally appropriate curriculum for <b>cultural</b> <b>diversities,</b> in this case Sámi schools is pointed out as an important area for research and development. The second area for development is teacher's professional identity in connection with cultural understanding and <b>cultural</b> <b>diversities.</b> A third area is knowledge of parental involvement in <b>cultural</b> <b>diversities</b> in school development. Cooperation with parents, elders, extended family and the indigenous community is an area of interest for future research. Teacher education is questioned in terms of democracy and tendencies of a mainstreamed education of teachers. A more receptive education based on the indigenous peoples needs is discussed. International research is highlighting cultural understanding, colonizing and decolonizing processes. A teacher working in a Sámi school needs a practice based and theoretical grounded teacher education. There is a lack of in service training of teachers in the same areas. Networks between the Teacher Educations Institutions in the North, in Sweden, Finland and Norway in Sápmi could serve as a point of departure in developing a research based education for teachers working with <b>cultural</b> <b>diversities</b> in the North.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{highlight}} some perspectives in education in compulsory schools and in teacher education in the North especially connected to cultural understanding and <b>cultural</b> <b>diversities.</b> Sensitivity in <b>cultural</b> understanding including curriculum texts about minorities is very limited {{and so is the}} cultural sensitivity towards and co-operation between home and community culture. <b>Cultural</b> <b>diversities</b> are often seen only as dilemmas. These challenges have been taken seriously in the longitudinal research-project introduced in this report. The issues will be dealt with through the Sámi culture. The first research question focuses on how parents and the local society can be involved in development of a culturally based curriculum. The second research question is dealing with how teachers and parents can support cultural understanding, and <b>cultural</b> <b>diversities</b> in the school context. The third research question is dealing with parental involvement and cooperation between school, parents, elders, extended family and the indigenous community.

Therefore, teaching English to multicultural groups of adults in Qatar, cannot be done effectively and efficiently, without taking the influence of <b>cultural</b> <b>diversities</b> and values, as well as the requirements of the adult learner, into account. This research deals with how native English speaking lecturers at one specific language centre in Qatar acknowledge these <b>cultural</b> <b>diversities</b> and values and how they accommodate adult learners in the multicultural classroom environment, by means of a literature study and an empirical investigation. Qualitative data collection was done by open-ended questionnaires to lecturers and learners, focus group interviews with lecturers and learners, individual interviews with lecturers, classroom observations and keeping of field notes. Findings revealed that lecturers are aware of the <b>cultural</b> <b>diversities</b> and values of learners who come into the classroom from different nationalities, and accommodated these learners without bias. These differences however, did not necessarily influence their teaching styles and lecturers remained focussed on teaching English as effectively as possible. Educational StudiesM. Ed.

40|$|Purpose – Social Innovation has {{attracted}} the attention of both Scholars and Practitioners for the last years, but very little investigations are actually available about the drivers that lie upon the adoption of social innovative practices at “for-profit” firm’s level. This is particularly true with reference to culture and <b>cultural</b> <b>diversities.</b> According to the underlined gap, our paper aims to investigate the role of culture, and <b>cultural</b> <b>diversities,</b> in defining Corporate Social Innovation (CSI). Design/methodology/approach – The paper is theoretically grounded and based on an inductive approach. An extensive literary review about Innovation and Corporate Social Responsibility - as well as about their cultural drivers - has been carried to gain a wide understanding of CSI as a trade-off between firms’ innovative attitude and their propensity to reach social aims. Hofstede’s cultural model has been, finally, used to interpret the cultural insights of CSI in two different contexts, Italy and Iran. Empirical evidences have been collected thanks to the contribution of the University of Azad, Iran. They allow us to complete the theoretical considerations developed about Iranian firms’ social orientation. Originality/value – Our paper contribute to the literature improving about CSI by developing a more comprehensive knowledge and culturally-based understanding within a still unexplored field. Practical implications – Our paper will expand the ability of both Academics and Practitioners to recognize culture as key driver of CSI. In doing this, it opens up future exploitations about the way culture and <b>cultural</b> <b>diversities</b> may be managed in order to improve the effectiveness of firms’ innovative practices with reference to corporate and collective well-being...|$|R
