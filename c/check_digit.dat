25|$|The {{underlying}} {{rules for}} IBANs {{is that the}} account-servicing financial institution should issue an IBAN, as {{there are a number}} of areas where different IBANs could be generated from the same account and branch numbers that would satisfy the generic IBAN validation rules. In particular cases where 00 is a valid <b>check</b> <b>digit,</b> 97 will not be a valid <b>check</b> <b>digit,</b> likewise, if 01 is a valid <b>check</b> <b>digit,</b> 98 will not be a valid <b>check</b> <b>digit,</b> similarly with 02 and 99.|$|E
25|$|If {{the final}} {{difference}} is 10, then the <b>check</b> <b>digit</b> becomes 0. To {{ensure that this}} does not happen, the standard recommends that serial numbers {{should not be used}} which produce a final difference of 10; however, there are containers in the market which do not follow this recommendation, so handling this case has to be included if a <b>check</b> <b>digit</b> calculator is programmed.|$|E

50|$|Such flaw {{against a}} single {{transposed}} pair of letters or digits {{would have been}} avoided using two <b>check</b> <b>digits</b> instead of just one (i.e. a 97 modulus instead of the 10 modulus, like in IBAN numbers which may also mix letters and digits).

25|$|ISO 6346 is an {{international}} standard covering the coding, identification and marking of intermodal (shipping) containers used within containerized intermodal freight transport. The standard establishes a visual identification system for every container that includes a unique serial number (with <b>check</b> <b>digit),</b> the owner, a country code, a size, type and equipment category {{as well as any}} operational marks. The standard is managed by the International Container Bureau (BIC).|$|E
25|$|Modular {{arithmetic}} {{is often}} used to calculate checksums that are used within identifiers. International Standard Book Number (ISBN) uses modulo 11 (if issued before 1 January, 2007) or modulo 10 (if issued on or after 1 January, 2007) arithmetic for error detection. Likewise, International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs), for example, make use of modulo 97 arithmetic to trap user input errors in bank account numbers. In chemistry, the last digit of the CAS registry number (a number which is unique for each chemical compound) is a <b>check</b> <b>digit,</b> which is calculated by taking the last digit of the first two parts of the CAS registry number times 1, the previous digit times 2, the previous digit times 3 etc., adding all these up and computing the sum modulo 10.|$|E

[...] Second, multiply each number by a weighting value. [...] This is a repeating pattern of 7,3,1. [...] For example, the first number is multiplied by 7, the second number by 3, the third by 1, the fourth by 7, the fifth by 3, etc. [...] Now, sum the products {{to obtain a}} single number. [...] Finally, divide the number by 10 and the remainder is your <b>check</b> <b>digit</b> (this {{is known as a}} modulo 10 calculation).|$|E

2500|$|According to the ECBS [...] "generation of the IBAN {{shall be}} the {{exclusive}} responsibility of the bank/branch servicing the account". The ECBS document replicates part of the ISO/IEC 7064:2003 standard as a method for generating <b>check</b> <b>digits</b> in the range 02 to 98. <b>Check</b> <b>digits</b> in the ranges 00 to 96, 01 to 97, and 03 to 99 will also provide validation of an IBAN, but the standard is silent {{as to whether or}} not these ranges may be used.|$|R

2500|$|Canada Post use 13 digit {{alphanumeric}} tracking numbers / barcodes {{for their}} pre-printed labels. [...] Bar codes consist of two letters, followed by eight sequence digits, and a ninth digit {{which is the}} <b>check</b> <b>digit.</b> The first two letters are the type of service (RN for registered mail, PG for express post envelopes). The last two characters are the letters CA. [...] The <b>check</b> <b>digit</b> ignores the letters and only concern itself with the first 8 numeric digits. The scheme is to multiply each of those 8 digits by a different weighting factor, (8 6 4 2 3 5 9 7). Add up the total {{of all of these}} multiplications and divide by 11. [...] The remainder after dividing by 11 gives a number from 0 to 10. Subtracting this from 11 gives a number from 1 to 11. [...] That result is the <b>check</b> <b>digit,</b> except in the two cases where it is 10 or 11. [...] If 10 it is then changed to a 0, and if 11 then it is changed to a 5. [...] The <b>check</b> <b>digit</b> may be used to verify if a barcode scan is correct, or if a manual entry of the barcode is correct.
