25|$|Many <b>Chassidim</b> of {{the seventh}} Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson felt {{that he is the}} Mashiach of the generation, even though he never said so himself.|$|E
25|$|As Rebbe, Rabbi Aharon {{was said}} to be {{incredibly}} charismatic. Stories related by the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, claimed that some <b>Chassidim</b> of Rabbi Dovber went to visit Rabbi Aharon and were so taken by his charisma that they stayed despite their promises to the contrary.|$|E
25|$|After Rabbi Aharon died, his son, Rabbi Haim Raphael HaLevi ben Aaron of Staroselye (d. 1842), became rebbe in his place. However, the dynasty did {{not last}} into the next generation. Many <b>chassidim</b> of the Strashelye {{returned}} to Chabad-Lubavitch in the third generation, accepting the Tzemach Tzedek as their Rebbe.|$|E
25|$|On the {{occasion}} of his Bar Mitzvah, his grandfather held a farbrengen. The farbrengen was attended by many thousands of <b>Chassidim</b> from across Eastern Europe and Russia. The Bar Mitzva {{was seen as a}} milestone for the Gurary dynasty. Special photographers were invited and the speech that Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak gave was published.|$|E
25|$|While {{his books}} are not {{commonly}} studied within Chabad circles today, they are widely respected for their scholarly insights and broad scope. Furthermore, the Toldos Avraham Yitzchak Rebbe instructed his <b>Chassidim</b> to study Rabbi Aharon's books. The discourses constitute explanations of passages in the Torah, or concepts in Torah thought, {{in the light}} of his Chassidic outlook.|$|E
25|$|Chabad publishes and {{distributes}} Jewish religious literature. Under Kehot Publication Society, Chabad's main publishing house, Jewish {{literature has}} {{been translated into}} 12 different languages. Kehot regularly provides books at discounted prices, and hosts book-a-thons. Kehot commonly distributes books written or transcribed from the rebbes of Chabad, prominent <b>chassidim</b> and other authors who have written Jewish materials.|$|E
25|$|During {{the latter}} portion of Rabbi Dovber’s life, his {{students}} dispersed over Europe, and after Rabbi Dovber's death, Rabbi Shneur Zalman became {{the leader of}} Hasidism in Lithuania, along with his senior colleague Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk. When Rabbi Menachem Mendel died (in 1788), Rabbi Schneur Zalman was recognized {{as leader of the}} <b>Chassidim</b> in Lithuania.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of Schneerson's death, the {{majority}} of Chabad <b>Chassidim</b> continue {{to see him as}} the most righteous Jewish leader of the time, the nasi hador, whose influence throughout the world remains very palpable. They acknowledge that he died, visit his grave and observe yahrtzeit. They tend to place little or no emphasis on whether or not the Schneerson will be mashiach. Instead they focus on actually trying to carry out and fulfill Schneerson's vision of making the world a better place.|$|E
25|$|When the Alter Rebbe left prison he was mistakenly {{brought to}} the home of a Misnagid (one opposed to Chassidus), who caused him to suffer with his questions. Afterwards, the Alter Rebbe said that the three hours he spent at the Misnaged’s home were more {{difficult}} than all the time he had spent in prison. In commemoration {{of the fact that the}} Alter Rebbe's liberation was not complete until he left the Misnagid's house, <b>Chassidim</b> mark 20 Kislev as a day of liberation as well.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1992, a special balcony was {{constructed}} on the upper level of the synagogue at 770 Eastern Parkway overlooking the main sanctuary to allow Schneerson to participate at the daily prayers. It soon became customary for many <b>chassidim</b> to recite the Yechi after prayer to which Schneerson made encouraging motions {{with his left hand}} (his right side had been paralyzed by the stroke). On certain occasions; the Rebbe made increasingly big signs of either encouragement or displeasure such as on Rosh Chodesh Kislev 1992 (5753); when the Rebbe moved his hand back and forth with extreme energy.|$|E
25|$|On March 2, 1992, while praying at the Ohel, {{the site}} where his {{father-in-law}} is buried, Schneerson suffered a massive stroke. That very evening, while he was being treated for his stroke and Chabad <b>Chassidim</b> around the world gathered for prayer, some of the messianists broke out in song and dance. It was {{during this period of}} illness and inability to communicate that the messianic movement reached its greatest fervor, and became more vocal of their hope that Schneerson would soon be the Mashiach. This also troubled many people who felt that it was being imposed upon Schneerson as something he had no control over.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} good friends, Rabbi Dovber and Rabbi Aharon {{disagreed}} about the emphasis on, and correct method of, emotional expression in Chassidic prayer. According to Rabbi Dovber, the greatest service a Jew can perform in worship is to totally nullify himself before The Creator. Therefore, maintained Rabbi Dovber, a person's meditation can {{appear to be}} cold and emotionless on the exterior, where the prayer causes the person praying to feel oneself one with The Creator. To that end, Rabbi Dovber prayed with great D'veikus (cleaving), rather than with Hispaylus (excitement), where the one praying gets excited over the Creator but remains, in his own feeling and understanding, a separate entity and existence. Rabbi Dovber prayed while perfectly still, hardly moving. His outward countenance remained completely unaffected. It {{is important to note}} this mode of davening was something personal to him, as he was able to conceal his emotions, rather than something he recommended for everyone. When the Rebbe DovBer noticed that his <b>chassidim</b> (followers) thought that they should be devoid of any emotional appearance, he wrote a public letter stating that this is wrong. His disagreement with Rabbi Aharon was rather that he felt that there must be an understanding of Godliness and a cleaving, in other words that one's emotional feeling be a lasting one, not one that would evaporate after a short time.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{authorities}} prohibit returning a handshake, even {{to avoid}} embarrassing the other person. For example, the Chazon Ish has been quoted as stating that shaking hands {{between men and}} women is [...] "absolutely forbidden" [...] This is also the opinion of Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky, Moshe Stern [...] Yitzchak Abadi, Yosef Hayyim, and Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg in his Sefer <b>Chassidim.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Schneerson {{argued that}} the volumes were not the [...] "personal possession" [...] of Gurary's grandfather, but the [...] "communal property" [...] of the Lubavitch Hasidim. This {{argument}} {{was supported by a}} letter from his father-in-law indicating that the books were the heritage of the entire Jewish community. [...] The organizational body that represents Lubavitch <b>Chassidim</b> - Agudas Chasidei Chabad (ACC), filed suit to retrieve the books.|$|E
2500|$|When Schneersohn came to America (he was {{the first}} major Chasidic leader to move {{permanently}} to the United States) two of his <b>chassidim</b> came to him, and said not to start up all the activities in which Lubavitch had engaged in Europe, because [...] "America is different." [...] To avoid disappointment, they advised him not even to try. Schneersohn wrote, [...] "Out of my eyes came boiling tears", and undeterred, the next day he started the first Lubavitcher Yeshiva in America, declaring that [...] "America is no different." [...] From 1940-1945, the Rebbe created a lot of turmoil within the US Jewish community since he refused to work with Rabbi Kalmanowitz and Rabbi Kotler of the VAAD in trying to help rescue more Jews out of Hitler's Europe. Instead, he focused heavily on trying to bring about the coming of the Messia. Also, instead of putting a most of his efforts into rescuing other Jews, he placed inordinate amount of time and energy in saving his books. Historian and head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Israel and Orthodox Jew Efraim Zuroff asks, [...] "How can one justify expending even a small amount of resources and energies to try and save the rebbe's library {{at a time when the}} rescue of lives should have taken precedence?" [...] One wonders why no one talked about using the funds and political contacts necessary for retrieving the books to save more Jews, but the Lubavitchers never discussed this matter. As Zuroff writes, Lubavitchers [...] "do not consider such a set of priorities controversial or in any way problematic", for the preservation of knowledge and torah learning is one of their highest priorities. In 1949, Schneersohn became a U.S. citizen, with his son-in-law Menachem Mendel assisting to coordinate the event. A special dispensation was arranged wherein the federal judge came to [...] "770" [...] to officiate at Rabbi Yoseph Yitzchak's citizenship proceedings, rather than the Rebbe travel to a courthouse for the proceedings. Uniquely, the event was recorded on color motion film. In 1950, Schneersohn died in his home in Brooklyn and many members, even the next Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson, declared him the Messiah. This caused a lot of problems for the Chabad community just like it would when Menachem Mendel Schneerson died in 1994, and many in the community declared him the Messiah. In 1951, Menachem Mendel Schneerson took over the leadership of Chabad and became the next Rebbe of Chabad. When this happened, many stopped declaring Rebbe Schneersohn the Messiah and focused on building out the community under the new Rebbe Schneerson (note: the confusion on names results from the fact that Rebbe Schneerson was the second cousin and son-in-law of Rebbe Schneersohn).|$|E

5000|$|There {{has been}} much debate {{regarding}} the extent and influence that this movement had on the Middle Ages and beyond. Scholars debate {{whether or not this}} pious community described in Sefer <b>Chassidim</b> existed beyond the imagination of Rabbi Judah the Pious. For instance, Yosef Dan posits that Sefer <b>Chassidim</b> was an individual work by Rabbi Judah the Pious, not a [...] "national work" [...] of Ashkenazic Jewry. He concludes that the community depicted within Sefer <b>Chassidim</b> was merely a blueprint for a structure that was never built. Rabbi Judah’s plans were never carried out. Many proofs motivated this approach. First, there is no reference in any Ashkenazic literature to any of the its particular ideas. Additionally, there is no external proof of existence for Pietistic communities. A controversial movement such as this one, which castigated much of the broader community, labeling them Reshaim, would certainly have been referenced by contemporary literature.|$|E
