5|$|With the film's Laserdisc release, Variety first {{reported}} in March 1994 that observers uncovered several scenes of antics from the animators that supposedly featured brief nudity of the Jessica Rabbit character.

Whether {{or not they were}} actually intended to depict the nudity of the character remains unknown. Many retailers said that within minutes of the Laserdisc debut, their entire inventory was sold out. The run was fueled by media reports about the controversy, including stories on <b>CNN</b> <b>and</b> various newspapers.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} our attempt at producing a state-of-the-art Twitter sentiment classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (<b>CNNs)</b> <b>and</b> Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs) networks. Our system leverages {{a large amount}} of unlabeled data to pre-train word embeddings. We then use a subset of the unlabeled data to fine tune the embeddings using distant supervision. The final <b>CNNs</b> <b>and</b> LSTMs are trained on the SemEval- 2017 Twitter dataset where the embeddings are fined tuned again. To boost performances we ensemble several <b>CNNs</b> <b>and</b> LSTMs together. Our approach achieved first rank on all of the five English subtasks amongst 40 teams.

5|$|I think {{a strong}} {{case can be made}} that {{political}} assassination actually does change things. If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well be president in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, {{but on the other hand}} I have to admit that if I clicked on <b>CNN</b> <b>and</b> heard somebody had blown Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.|$|E

40|$|Distinguishing edges {{caused by}} a change in depth from other types of edges is an {{important}} problem in early vi- sion. We investigate the performance of humans and com- puter vision models on this task. We use spherical imagery with ground-truth LiDAR range data to build an objective ground-truth dataset for edge classification. We compare various computational models for classifying depth from non-depth edges in small images patches and achieve the best performance (86 %) with a convolutional neural net- work. We investigate human performance on this task in a behavioral experiment and find that human performance {{is lower than the}} <b>CNN.</b> Although human <b>and</b> <b>CNN</b> depth re- sponses are correlated, observers’ responses are better pre- dicted by other observers than by the CNN. The responses of <b>CNNs</b> <b>and</b> human observers also show a slightly differ- ent pattern of correlation with low-level edge cues, which suggests that <b>CNNs</b> <b>and</b> human observers may weight these features differently for classifying edges. <br/...|$|R
