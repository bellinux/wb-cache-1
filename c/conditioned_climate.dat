5000|$|As {{stewards}} {{of the public}} trust, Museums bear a responsibility to maintain collections utilizing the most efficient methods available. Museums must do their part {{to ensure that there}} is a public to enjoy the collection and resources to exhibit the collection. One way museums can conserve resources is to incorporate energy saving practices into their daily operations, altering the facilities they already inhabit rather than building anew. Brophy and Wylie identify simple solutions such as installing motion sensors that turn the lights on when visitors enter the gallery and turn the lights off when they exit, such as those found at Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia. Those lightbulbs could even be replaced with long-lasting LED bulbs.Other museums that manipulate their facilities location include the Morgan Library, as identified by Brophy and Wylie, whose storage is [...] "carved out of Manhattan bedrock." [...] The bedrock provides natural cool storage without using electricity to generate an air <b>conditioned</b> <b>climate.</b> Thus neither money nor electricity are spent to control the climate of the storage space, which stresses not only museum funds but increasingly scarce electricity too.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} {{is to provide a}} clear and {{thorough}} conceptual analysis of the main candidates for a definition of climate and climate change. Five desiderata on a definition of climate are presented: it should be empirically applicable, it should correctly classify different climates, it should not depend on our knowledge, is should be applicable to the past, present and future and it should be mathematically well-defined. Then five definitions are discussed: climate as distribution over time for constant external <b>conditions,</b> <b>climate</b> as distribution over time when the external conditions vary as in reality, climate as distribution over time relative to regimes of varying external <b>conditions,</b> <b>climate</b> as the ensemble distribution for constant external <b>conditions,</b> and <b>climate</b> as the ensemble distribution when the external conditions vary as in reality. The third definition is novel and is introduced as a response to problems with existing definitions. The conclusion is that most definitions encounter serious problems and that the third definition is most promising...|$|R

Proximate exposures occur through air, food, water, and skin contact. Distal exposures cause adverse health conditions directly by altering proximate exposures, and indirectly through changes in ecosystems and other support systems for human health.|$|R
