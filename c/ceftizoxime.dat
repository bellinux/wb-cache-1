2500|$|Among Gram-negative bacteria, the {{emergence}} of resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins {{has been a major}} concern. It appeared initially in a limited number of bacterial species (C. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, and P. aeruginosa) that could mutate to hyperproduce their chromosomal class C β-lactamase. A few years later, resistance appeared in bacterial species not naturally producing AmpC enzymes (K. pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., P. mirabilis) due to the production of TEM- or SHV-type ESBLs. Characteristically, such resistance has included oxyimino- (for example <b>ceftizoxime,</b> cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime, as well as the oxyimino-monobactam aztreonam), but not 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins [...] (cephamycins; in other words, cefoxitin and cefotetan); has been blocked by inhibitors such as clavulanate, sulbactam, or tazobactam, and did not involve carbapenems and temocillin. Chromosomal-mediated AmpC β-lactamases represent a new threat, since they confer resistance to 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins (cephamycins) such as cefoxitin or cefotetan are not affected by commercially available β-lactamase inhibitors, and can, in strains with loss of outer membrane porins, provide resistance to carbapenems.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether (a) <b>ceftizoxime</b> can replace cefoxitin {{in the prevention}} and treatment of various infections in a major teaching hospital, (b) a previously applied two-stage intervention program is an effective method of instituting a therapeutic interchange of <b>ceftizoxime</b> for cefoxitin and (c) the replacement of cefoxitin with <b>ceftizoxime</b> results in a more cost-effective therapy. DESIGN: Two-phase, open, sequential study. SETTING: Tertiary care teaching hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred patients who received cefoxitin during the 6 months immediately {{before the start of}} the interchange program (phase 1) and 100 who received <b>ceftizoxime</b> during the 6 months immediately after the start of the program (phase 2) were randomly selected. RESULTS: The demographic characteristics of the two patient groups were similar except for sex (p < 0. 05). The cefoxitin doses were usually given every 6 hours (in 33 % of the cases) or every 8 hours (in 61 %), whereas the <b>ceftizoxime</b> doses were usually given every 12 hours (in 98 %). Prescriber distribution was stable throughout the study period, the Department of General Surgery being responsible for about 70 % of the orders. Prophylactic indications accounted for over 60 % of the treatment courses. The proportion of prophylactic treatment courses that resulted in a successful clinical outcome did not differ between the two groups (cefoxitin 92 % and <b>ceftizoxime</b> 91 %). Of the empiric or directed treatment courses clinical success or improvement was observed in 89 % of the cefoxitin and 91 % of the <b>ceftizoxime</b> recipients. Microbiologic eradication was seen in 65 % of the cefoxitin and 90 % of the <b>ceftizoxime</b> directed treatment courses. Pathogens isolated during therapy were similar in the two treatment groups. Diarrhea was the most common adverse effect, occurring in 8 % of the cefoxitin and 10 % of the <b>ceftizoxime</b> recipients; no Clostridium difficile or C. -difficile-producing toxin was identified in these patients. The <b>ceftizoxime</b> therapy was 36 % less expensive than the cefoxitin therapy on average, and the annual savings was estimated to be $ 83, 123. An estimated 5615 drug doses were avoided annually, for an additional savings of $ 24, 875 in drug administration. Therefore, the total estimated annual cost savings resulting from this two-stage interchange program was $ 107, 998. Given the cost of $ 4856 to implement and maintain the program, the estimated net savings for the first year was $ 103, 142.

Four rabbits, implanted with four chambers each, received each drug intramuscularly at {{a dose of}} 50 mg/kg every 3 hours for eight doses. Serum drug concentrations were measured after the eighth dose, and extravascular (chamber) concentrations were measured after the first and eighth doses. Cefotaxime (93 % bound to rabbit serum proteins) demonstrated a much lower peak chamber-to-peak serum percent penetration after the first dose (20 / 163 = 13 %) than did the less-bound (32 %) <b>ceftizoxime</b> (21 / 52 = 40 %, P less than 0. 002). Similarly, {{the ratio of the}} chamber fluid area under the curve to the serum area under the curve was significantly lower for cefotaxime (15 %) than for <b>ceftizoxime</b> (44 %, P less than 0. 002) after the first dose. Both agents approached equilibrium conditions between the intravascular and extravascular space by the eighth dose, and the ratios of chamber area under the curve to serum area under the curve of cefotaxime (76 %) and <b>ceftizoxime</b> (79 %) were similar. The peak-to-peak percent penetration of <b>ceftizoxime</b> (54 %) was still significantly higher than that of cefotaxime (41 %, P less than 0. 01), although the chamber concentration of cefotaxime (66. 2 micrograms/ml) was considerably higher than that of <b>ceftizoxime</b> (28. 2 micrograms/ml). This study illustrates (i) dampened peak-to-trough antibiotic level fluctuation seen at extravascular sites as compared with measured serum concentrations, (ii) the large differences in extravascular penetration between single- and multiple-dose studies, and (iii) the importance of serum protein binding in the delay, but not the prevention, of extravascular drug distribution...|$|E
40|$|A new {{cephalosporin}} derivative, <b>ceftizoxime</b> (syn FK 749), and its anti isomer, FR 14060, {{were compared}} in antibacterial activity, outer membrane permeability, stability to beta-lactamases, and affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), using Escherichia coli NIHJ JC- 2 and Enterobacter cloacae 58 - 5 as the test organisms. Although <b>ceftizoxime</b> was superior in antibacterial activity to FR 14060, no marked {{differences between the}} two agents were found in outer membrane permeability and stability to cephalosporinase. However, the affinity for PBPs and stability to penicillinase of <b>ceftizoxime</b> and FR 14060 differed significantly. Concentrations of <b>ceftizoxime</b> required to reduce [14 C]penicillin G binding by 50 % were below 1 microgram/ml for PBPs 1 a and 1 bs of E. cloacae 58 - 5 and below 3. 2 microgram/ml for PBPs 1 a and 1 bs of E. coli NIHJ JC- 2. A more than 10 -fold-higher concentration of FR 14060 was required for 50 % reduction of (14 C]penicillin G binding to PBP 1 bs of strains tested. <b>Ceftizoxime</b> was severalfold more stable than FR 14060 to penicillinase, but the antibacterial activity of both drugs against penicillinase-producing E. coli was as strong as against non-penicillinase-producing E. coli. These results indicate that {{the difference between the two}} compounds in antibacterial activity is likely to be due to differences in their abilities to inhibit peptidoglycan polymerization...|$|E

Comparison of this method with bioassay gave a linear regression line described by Y = 1. 11 + 0. 98 X, with a correlation coefficient of 0. 984. The anion-exchange extraction method is a fast, reliable method of preparing serum samples containing <b>ceftizoxime</b> for assay by liquid chromatography...|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} twenty-three episodes of infections in cancer {{patients}} with adequate neutrophil counts {{were treated with}} <b>ceftizoxime</b> (low dose: 1 g iv every 4 h, and high dose: 2 g iv every 4 h) {{for a minimum of}} 7 days or until 4 days after the patient became afebrile. One hundred and fourteen episodes in 105 patients were evaluated. The overall response rate in 68 patients with documented infection treated with low dose <b>ceftizoxime</b> was 50 % whether or not an organism could be obtained. Twenty of 25 patients (80 %) with fever of unknown origin (FUO) also responded to low dose <b>ceftizoxime.</b> The overall response rate in 82 episodes of infection treated with high dose <b>ceftizoxime</b> was 62 % in proven infections, 59 % when no organism could be found. Six of seven patients with FUO (86 %) responded. Overall response rate in Gram-positive infections was 75 %; in Gram-negative infections was 70 %. Rate of superinfection was low (6 %).

40|$|This {{article is}} {{a summary of the}} results of the {{comparative}} studies of <b>ceftizoxime</b> with a variety of currently acceptable antibiotic regimens. These studies include three major types of infections: lower respiratory, urinary tract and soft tissue. When indicated, I have combined and analysed the data collectively, so that in terms of numbers of cases treated, statistical inferences may be drawn. Finally, based on the reported data and my assessment of them, I have attempted to draw some conclusions concerning the clinical effectiveness of this antibiotic. Respiratory tract infections The therapeutic results of five independently conducted studies comparing <b>ceftizoxime</b> with either cefamandole or cefazolin in the therapy of lower respiratory infections (pneumonia and acute purulent tracheobronchitis and bronchitis) are summarized in Tabel I. In these studies, doses of 2 - 6 g/day of <b>ceftizoxime,</b> 4 - 8 g/day of cefamandole and 2 - 8 g/day of cefazolin were employed for 7 - 14 days. Dosing intervals were generally less frequent (8 - 12 hourly) for <b>ceftizoxime</b> than for cefamandole or cefazolin (6 hourly) ...|$|E
40|$|The veterinarians {{frequently}} use ceftriaxone intramuscularly {{in treatment}} of mastitis. Fibrosin®, a polyherbal drug is also commonly used as supportive therapy for let down of milk during mastitis. The {{present study was}} conducted to determine milk level of <b>ceftizoxime,</b> a major active metabolite of ceftriaxone and its effect on milk enzyme activity in lactating goats following single dose intramuscular administration of ceftriaxone (@ 50 mg / kg body weight) with or without one hour prior to oral administration of polyherbal drug (1. 9 gm). Twelve clinically healthy lactating Black Bengal goats were divided into two groups (namely Group I, group II) each containing six goats. A single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone was administered at 50 mg/kg body weight to each goat of group-I only, while a total dose of 1. 9 gm of polyherbal drug was administered orally to each goat of group-II before one hour of cefriaxone administration. Milk concentration of ceftriaxone and <b>ceftizoxime</b> were analyzed by HPLC. <b>Ceftizoxime</b> was detected in milk from 5 minutes to 24 hours post dosing following single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone without Fibrosin® administration. However, neither ceftriaxone nor <b>ceftizoxime</b> could be detected in milk following single intramuscular dosing of ceftriaxone with Fibrosin® administration. Milk alkaline phosphatase and catalase activity as well as reduced glutathione level did not differ significantly between group I and group II animals. Milk alkaline phosphatase activity was increased markedly following intramuscular administration of ceftriaxone indicating mammary tissue damage. Thus the present study showed that Fibrosin® should be avoided with intramuscular ceftriaxone for treatment of mastitis due to unavailability of ceftriaxone / <b>ceftizoxime</b> in milk. However, oral administration of Fibrosin can be preferred in other bacterial infections with concurrent administration of intramuscular ceftriaxone as it reduces milk residue of <b>ceftizoxime...</b>|$|E
40|$|The MIC and MBC {{activity}} of mezlocillin alone and {{in combination with}} two concentrations of <b>ceftizoxime,</b> moxalactam, and amikacin and a single concentration of cefoxitin was studied in a broth microdilution partial checkerboard against 472 strains of aerobic gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Azlocillin was tested alone {{and in the same}} combinations against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Of the gram-negative bacilli tested, 38 % were gentamicin resistant. Antagonism (less than or equal to a fourfold ureidopenicillin MIC increase) was observed frequently with combinations of ureidopenicillins plus cefoxitin and sporadically with ureidopenicillins plus <b>ceftizoxime</b> or moxalactam. Partial synergism (less than or equal to a fourfold ureidopenicillin MIC decrease) was evident with both combinations of ureidopenicillins plus amikacin and ureidopenicillins plus <b>ceftizoxime</b> or moxalactam, the percentage being dependent upon the individual species and combinations...|$|E
40|$|Minimum {{inhibitory}} {{concentrations of}} <b>ceftizoxime</b> for seven clinical isolates of Bacteroides fragilis {{were found to}} be markedly affected by inoculum size; the very low minimum inhibitory concentration values (less than or equal to 0. 25 microgram/ml) obtained in tests with most strains were not sustained when the inoculum was raised 100 -fold. Benzylpenicillin and cephalothin were also affected by inoculum size, but cefoxitin was not. Antibiotic assays showed that the strains inactivated <b>ceftizoxime</b> and cephalothin completely, benzylpenicillin partially, and cefoxitin not at all. Morphological investigations revealed that populations of B. fragilis responded differently to each of the four beta-lactam agents during {{the early stages of the}} encounter between B. fragilis and the antibiotic. Benzylpenicillin and cefoxitin induced spheroplast formation at lower concentrations than did <b>ceftizoxime.</b> Cephalothin evoked a novel morphological response that was not seen with other beta-lactam agents...|$|E
