5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, light does not travel along {{straight}} lines when it propagates in a gravitational field. Instead, it is deflected {{in the presence}} of massive bodies. In particular, starlight is deflected as it passes near the Sun, leading to apparent shifts of up 1.75 arc seconds in the stars' positions in the sky (an arc second is equal to 1/3600 of a degree). In the framework of Newtonian gravity, a heuristic argument <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> leads to light deflection by half that amount. The different predictions can be tested by observing stars that are close to the Sun during a solar eclipse. In this way, a British expedition to West Africa in 1919, directed by Arthur Eddington, confirmed that Einstein's prediction was correct, and the Newtonian predictions wrong, via observation of the May 1919 eclipse. Eddington's results were not very accurate; subsequent observations of the deflection of the light of distant quasars by the Sun, which utilize highly accurate techniques of radio astronomy, have confirmed Eddington's results with significantly better precision (the first such measurements date from 1967, the most recent comprehensive analysis from 2004).|$|E

This solution is essentially an application of the doctrine of double effect, which says that you may take action which has bad side effects, but deliberately intending harm (even for good causes) is wrong.|$|E

Unlike the situation with using expensive factory ammunition, handloaded match ammunition <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> is vastly more accurate, and, through reloading, that can be much more affordable, than anything that can be purchased, being customized for a particular rifle.|$|E
25|$|In many {{synthetic}} processes using {{transition metal}} catalysts, metal nanoparticles {{play an important}} role as the actual catalyst or as a catalyst reservoir. ILs are an appealing medium for the formation and stabilization of catalytically active transition metal nanoparticles. More importantly, ILs <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> incorporate coordinating groups, for example, with nitrile groups on either the cation or anion (CN-IL). In various C-C coupling reactions catalyzed by a palladium catalyst, it has been found that palladium nanoparticles are better stabilized in CN-IL compared to non-functionalized ionic liquids; thus enhanced catalytic activity and recyclability are realized.|$|E

50|$|The {{solderability}} of a substrate is {{a measure}} of the ease with which a soldered joint <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> to <b>that</b> material. Good solderability requires wetting (low contact angle) of the substrate by the solder.|$|R
25|$|Cryptography {{is central}} to digital rights {{management}} (DRM), a group of techniques for technologically controlling use of copyrighted material, being widely implemented and deployed {{at the behest of}} some copyright holders. In 1998, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which criminalized all production, dissemination, and use of certain cryptanalytic techniques and technology (now known or later discovered); specifically, those {{that could be used to}} circumvent DRM technological schemes. This had a noticeable impact on the cryptography research community since an argument <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> any cryptanalytic research violated, or might violate, the DMCA. Similar statutes have since been enacted in several countries and regions, including the implementation in the EU Copyright Directive. Similar restrictions are called for by treaties signed by World Intellectual Property Organization member-states.|$|E

25|$|The DMCA has {{affected}} the worldwide cryptography research community, since an argument <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> any cryptanalytic research violates, or might violate, the DMCA. The arrest of Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov in 2001, for alleged infringement of the DMCA, was a highly publicized example of the law's use to prevent or penalize development of anti-DRM measures. While working for ElcomSoft in Russia, he developed The Advanced eBook Processor, a software application allowing users to strip usage restriction information from restricted e-books, an activity legal in both Russia and the United States. Paradoxically, under the DMCA, it is not legal in the United States to provide such a tool. Sklyarov was arrested in the United States after presenting a speech at DEF CON and subsequently spent nearly a month in jail. The DMCA has also been cited as chilling to legitimate users, such as students of cryptanalysis (including, in a well-known instance, Professor Edward Felten and students at Princeton), and security consultants such as Niels Ferguson, who has declined to publish information about vulnerabilities he discovered in an Intel secure-computing scheme because of his concern about being arrested under the DMCA when he travels to the U.S.|$|E

A bee or bee colony that appears to have succumbed to a pathogen may not have died if it had not also been exposed to a sublethal dose of a pesticide and/or been subject to food stress (which might in turn be due to drought or heavy rain induced by climate change, or competition from a high density of honey bee hives placed nearby). Unfortunately, conducting well-replicated studies of the effects of multiple interacting stressors on bee colonies is exceedingly difficult. The number of stressor combinations rapidly becomes large, and exposure to stressors is hard or impossible to control with free-flying bees. Nonetheless, a strong argument <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> it is the interaction among parasites, pesticides, and diet that {{lies at the heart of}} current bee health problems." ...|$|E
