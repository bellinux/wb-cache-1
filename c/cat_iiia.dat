50|$|<b>CAT</b> <b>IIIa</b> -This {{category}} permits {{pilots to}} land {{with a decision}} height as low as 50 ft (15 m) and a RVR of 200 m. It needs a fail-passive autopilot. There must be only a 10−6 probability of landing outside the prescribed area.|$|E
50|$|The first {{aircraft}} {{to be certified}} to CAT III standards, on 28 December 1968, was the Sud Aviation Caravelle, followed by the Hawker-Siddeley HS.121 Trident in May 1972 (<b>CAT</b> <b>IIIA)</b> and to CAT IIIB during 1975. The Trident had been certified to CAT II on 7 February 1968.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to other operations, CAT III weather minima {{do not provide}} sufficient visual references to allow a manual landing to be made. CAT III minima depend on roll-out control and redundancy of the autopilot, because they give only enough time for the pilot {{to decide whether the}} aircraft will land in the touchdown zone (basically <b>CAT</b> <b>IIIa)</b> and to ensure safety during rollout (basically CAT IIIb). Therefore, an automatic landing system is mandatory to perform Category III operations. Its reliability must be sufficient to control the aircraft to touchdown in <b>CAT</b> <b>IIIa</b> operations and through rollout to a safe taxi speed in CAT IIIb (and CAT IIIc when authorized). [...] However, special approval has been granted to some operators for hand-flown CAT III approaches using a head-up display (HUD) guidance which provides the pilot with an image viewed through the windshield with eyes focused at infinity, of necessary electronic guidance to land the airplane with no true outside visual references.|$|E
50|$|RVR is {{also the}} main {{criterion}} {{used to determine the}} category of visual aids that are installed at an airport. The International Civil Aviation Organization ICAO stipulates in its Annex 14 that for RVR values above 550 m, CAT I lighting shall be installed, if RVR is between 300 m and 549 m then CAT II lighting is required. <b>CAT</b> <b>IIIa</b> is installed for RVR values between 175 m and 300 m. CAT IIIb is required for RVR values between 50 m and 175 m while there is no RVR limitation for CAT IIIc visual aids.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s it was {{designated}} {{as an international}} airport and was upgraded with a <b>CAT</b> <b>IIIa</b> instrument landing system. The runway was extended from 2,500 to 3,500 metres and terminal buildings for international flights, control tower, the official hall and the administrative building were constructed. The airport was named after aeronautics pioneer Traian Vuia in 2003. The following year work to expand the international terminal commenced; and in 2006 the aircraft parking facilities were enlarged. These measures were taken to cater to increasing air traffic {{and the construction of}} a new parking lot and an access road in the airport. The extension works for the international terminal were completed in 2007. In 2010 work to expand the domestic terminal was completed.|$|E
50|$|The airport has two {{parallel}} runways, aligned 01/19. The west runway 01L/19R is 3600 x 45 m, while the east runway 01R/19L is 2950 x 45 m. Both have taxiways, allowing 80 air movements per hour. The runways {{are equipped with}} <b>CAT</b> <b>IIIA</b> instrument landing system and the airport is supervised by a 91 m tall control tower. Once departing aircraft are 15 km away from the airport, responsibility is taken over by Oslo Air Traffic Control Center, which supervises the airspace with Haukåsen Radar. There are two ground radars at the airport, located on the far sides {{of each of the}} runways. Both at the gates and along the taxiways, there is an automatic system of lights that guide the aircraft.

50|$|In the United States, {{airports}} with CAT III {{approaches have}} listings for <b>CAT</b> <b>IIIa</b> and IIIb or just CAT III {{on the instrument}} approach plate (U.S. Terminal Procedures). CAT IIIb RVR minimums are limited by the runway/taxiway lighting and support facilities, and {{are consistent with the}} airport Surface Movement Guidance Control System (SMGCS) plan. Operations below 600 ft RVR require taxiway centerline lights and taxiway red stop bar lights. If the CAT IIIb RVR minimums on a runway end are 600 ft, which is a common figure in the U.S., ILS approaches to that runway end with RVR below 600 ft qualify as CAT IIIc and require special taxi procedures, lighting, and approval conditions to permit the landings. FAA Order 8400.13D limits CAT III to 300 ft RVR or better. Order 8400.13D (2009) allows special authorization CAT II approaches to runways without ALSF-2 approach lights and/or touchdown zone/centerline lights, which has expanded the number of potential CAT II runways.|$|E

40|$|This final thesis {{project is}} {{done at the}} Control Laws EXPERTISE Team at the Auto Flight Control Systems Department of THALES Avionics in Toulouse. The {{division}} currently works for both aircraft and helicopter manufacturers. An autopilot (AP) for use in commercial aircrafts must be certified by national authorities; in the EU this body is named European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). For landing there are different certification standards. The first standard is called CAT I which is used when weather conditions prevents the pilot from seeing the runway during the initial approach. The <b>CAT</b> <b>IIIa</b> {{on the other hand}} is the standard needed when the weather conditions are so adverse that the pilot cannot see the runway markings until 50 ft over the ground. This project aims to investigate the possibility to upgrade a given aircraft from a <b>CAT</b> <b>IIIa</b> to a CAT IIIb EASA certification. The CAT IIIb includes the <b>CAT</b> <b>IIIa</b> with an AP controlled runway rollout. The work includes the following: System analysis Proposition of a control law Implementation in non linear Simulink model Mock-up: Simulation visualization with synchronized Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA) and Primary Flight Display (PFD) The primary objective is not to search for the optimal solution for a CAT IIIb upgrade but rather to identify the eventual problems that will be encountered due to system architecture and rollout dynamics. First a system analysis is done. Here important information about the architecture is found. For example there is no connection between the nose wheel command and the auto flight system, which will be necessary, and some parts in the Fly-By-Wire (FBW) system have to be disconnected during the rollout. Also important is an analysis of the ground reaction model made by the client i. e. calculation of friction coefficients and forces. Next step is to develop a control law and a linear model for the rollout is therefore made. The absolute speed {{is supposed to be the}} rudder and the nose wheel, we obtain a 2 nd degree state space model with the yaw rate r [rd/s] and the lateral speed Vy [m/s] (AC - coordinates) states. Since the rudder only gives effect at relatively high speeds (over ≈ 100 knots) and the nose wheel due to stability only can be used at low speeds (under ≈ 50 kn) this can be seen as two different systems and one control law can be developed for each command. The commands are then distributed proportionally between these speeds. The maximal deviation from the runway for the nominal flight case with 15 knots of crosswind is acceptable. However, it does not converge until rather late in the rollout. Simulations with stronger crosswind and head wind have been made with good results. Wet runways or less landing mass seem to be the most degrading cases. At touch down a yaw bar appears in the FPD and shows the control target of the AP. The FMA is complemented with the mode rollout during that phase. The connection with the simulator makes it possible for the viewer to understand the relation between the different phases and the AP logics. The control law is stable for the nominal case and even for different masses and runway conditions. However, when these variables are changed simultaneously unstable behavior appears. The phase just after touchdown should be improved. The FMA and PFD with proper annunciation synchronized with the flight simulator enable the uninitiated to understand the CAT IIIb operation...|$|E
