2500|$|When fired, {{a portion}} of the {{propellant}} gases are evacuated into the gas cylinder through a [...] port, drilled at a 30° angle in the barrel, and a channel in the gas block. The high-pressure gases drive the piston rod (which is attached to the bolt carrier) rearward. During this rearward movement, a <b>cam</b> <b>slot</b> machined into the bolt carrier engages a cam pin on the bolt and rotates the bolt, unlocking the action. The arrangement of parts on the bolt carrier assembly provides for a degree of free travel, allowing gas pressure in the barrel to drop to a safe level before unlocking. To the immediate rear of the chrome-plated piston head is a notched ring which provides a reduced bearing surface and alleviates excess gas build-up. As the bolt carrier travels back, it compresses the return spring guided in a hollowed section of the bolt carrier and the return energy contained in the spring drives the moving assembly back forward, stripping a new round from the magazine and locking the action. The cocking handle is attached to the bolt carrier {{on the right side of}} the receiver and reciprocates with each shot; the handle is bent upwards allowing for operation with the left hand while the shooting hand remains on the pistol grip.|$|E
50|$|The MTB 1925 {{is fed from}} Carcano M91 clips {{that fall}} out of the bottom when the {{magazine}} is empty. The magazine follower closely resembles that of the M91. Despite appearing to be semiautomatic, it actually functions as a straight-pull manually-operated bolt action. The massive cylindrical bolt is in two sections of roughly equal size, front and rear. The rear section rotates when the bolt is opened via a spiral <b>cam</b> <b>slot</b> cut into it on the right side (possibly on the left as well, covered by the receiver). The front bolt segment does not turn.|$|E
50|$|When fired, {{propellant}} gases {{from the}} ignited cartridge following the projectile down the bore are vented through a gas port into a gas cylinder where they drive the piston and bolt carrier rearward. There is about 0.2 in of uninterrupted free travel calculated {{to permit the}} gas build-up in the bore to drop to a safe level before the carrier's <b>cam</b> <b>slot</b> rotates the bolt counter-clockwise to unlock. The locking lugs have no pitch therefore no primary extraction occurs during the unlocking sequence. A deeply seated spring-loaded claw extractor in the bolt head extracts the spent cartridge casing from the chamber and a spring-powered ejector fixed to the front feed mechanism trigger housing ejects the casing. The bolt carrier continues to the rear and compresses the recoil spring on its guide rod.|$|E
50|$|Adell and Baltzer, of L. S Starrett Co., {{patented}} {{a design}} with concentric shells and pins in <b>cam</b> <b>slots</b> as the triggering mechanism, and Adell and Starrett received a 1907 patent for a design using a sliding block actuated by a tapered bore {{in the body}} {{to hold back the}} hammer.|$|R
5000|$|The FG 42 was a select-fire {{air-cooled}} {{weapon and}} one of the first to incorporate the [...] "straight-line" [...] recoil configuration. This layout, combined with the side magazine, placed both the center of gravity and the position of the shoulder stock nearly in line with the longitudinal axis of the bore, a feature increasing controllability during burst or automatic fire. The operating system was derived from that used in the successful Lewis light machine gun with a gas piston-actuated turning-bolt locking mechanism. This system used pressurized exhaust gases from the bore and channeled them through a port drilled in the barrel into a gas cylinder located under the barrel. The rapid build-up of propellant gases imparted rearward pressure on a long-stroke piston, driving it backwards, while an extension of the bolt carrier interacted with a helical <b>camming</b> <b>slot</b> machined into the bolt carrier, converting this linear movement into an angular velocity and forcing the bolt into a rotary motion, clearing the locking juts and unlocking it near the end of the bolt carrier's travel. The weapon was locked into battery by two lugs on the bolt head which recessed into appropriate cavities machined into the receiver walls. Owing to its main intended use by paratroopers, the rear sight (which necessarily was rather high due to the straight stock design) was a flip-up construction.|$|R
50|$|To {{load the}} pistol grasp the {{breechblock}} on the serrated gripping surfaces {{on the sides}} and pull the machine straight to the rear. The magazine follower rises to hold the action open while the cross beam at the forward end of the slide compresses the recoil spring. Insert a loaded stripper clip into the clip guide {{in the face of}} the breech block and then strip the cartridges into the magazine, compressing the spring below the follower. An illustration of this process is shown in the , Mannlicher Rifles and Pistols, Smith, 1947. The spring lip at the top of the magazine serves to hold the cartridges. The cam on the right side of the frame, being forced up by the lesser arm of the mainspring, pushes the <b>cam</b> into the <b>slot</b> in the under surface of the breechblock slide and holds the machine back as explained above.|$|R
5000|$|George Chinn {{notes about}} the 1907 model that: [...] "While it was gas {{actuated}} {{by means of}} a piston, the French reversed the conventional principle. Instead of the piston thrust rearward furnishing the source of energy to operate the piece, the gas propels the piston forward to unlock the bolt. The piston is attached by a spring-loaded rod to a gear rack. This in turn engages a spur gear which is fastened to an actuating lever. When the lever is in the forward horizontal position and engages a <b>cam</b> <b>slot</b> in the bolt, the gun is locked. Upon firing, the gas drives the piston forward, compressing the spring and causing the spur gear to rotate clockwise. The actuating lever turns with the gear for a half revolution, retracting the bolt and stopping at the rear horizontal position. The driving spring then forces the piston rearward, which reverses the action and returns the bolt to battery." ...|$|E
50|$|The Hi-Power, {{like many}} other Browning designs, {{operates}} on the short-recoil principle, where the barrel and slide initially recoil together until the barrel is unlocked from the slide by a cam arrangement. Unlike Browning's earlier Colt M1911 pistol, the barrel is not moved vertically by a toggling link, but instead by a hardened bar which crosses the frame under the barrel and contacts a slot under the chamber, at the rearmost part of the barrel. The barrel and slide recoil together for a short distance but, as the slot engages the bar, the chamber and {{the rear of the}} barrel are drawn downward and stopped. The downward movement of the barrel disengages it from the slide, which continues rearward, extracting the spent case from the chamber and ejecting it while also re-cocking the hammer. After the slide reaches the limit of its travel, the recoil spring brings it forward again, stripping a new round from the magazine and pushing it into the chamber. This also pushes the chamber and barrel forward. The <b>cam</b> <b>slot</b> and bar move the chamber upward and the locking lugs on the barrel re-engage those in the slide.|$|E
50|$|The {{machine gun}} feeds from the {{left-hand}} side {{through a variety}} of disintegrating ammunition belt types: the American M13 linked belt, the German DM6 counterpart to the M13 or the segmented German DM1 belt. The ratcheting wheel feed unit was designed as an easily removable module that is inserted into the bottom portion of the feed block (installed in place of the standard magazine well), below the barrel axis. As a result of this configuration (the bolt passes over the belt), the ammunition belt is aligned upside down compared to most other belt-fed weapons (that is, the links face downward). The feed mechanism is actuated by the reciprocating movement of the bolt; a curved <b>cam</b> <b>slot</b> {{on the bottom of the}} bolt engages an actuator in the feed mechanism, rotating the double sprockets and positioning a new round in the feed path. Simple conversion from belt to magazine feed is possible by installing an adapter in the feed block which enables the use of H&K’s proprietary 20-round box magazine (from the G3 rifle) or a 50-round drum magazine. The HK21 uses a modified G3 receiver that has been extended to the front sight base and is equipped with a detachable bipod (mounted either in front of the feed mechanism or at the muzzle) and tripod and vehicle mounting points. The HK21 has close to a 48% parts interchangeability with the G3.|$|E
50|$|When fired, {{a portion}} of the {{propellant}} gases are evacuated into the gas cylinder through a 1.8 mm port, drilled at a 30° angle in the barrel, and a channel in the gas block.

5000|$|The SG 540 is an air-cooled, gas-operated, {{selective}} fire {{assault rifle}} that fires from a closed bolt position. SIG designers used a long-stroke piston-driven action (with the recoil spring {{wrapped around the}} piston rod itself) and an adjustable gas regulator with three settings: [...] "0"—used to launch rifle grenades, [...] "1"—used in normal operating conditions and [...] "2"—used in extreme environmental conditions or {{in the presence of}} heavy fouling. The firearm is locked into battery by means of a rotating bolt which features two heavy steel locking lugs. The bolt head is rotated by a control cam riding in a helical guide slot machined into the bolt carrier. When a shot is fired, propellant gases from the barrel are fed into the gas cylinder located above the barrel and impart rearward pressure on the piston rod, which drives the bolt carrier back. After a certain amount of free travel built into the system to allow the projectile to depart the barrel, residual gas pressures in the bore drop to a safe level, allowing the breech to be opened. The <b>cam</b> <b>slot</b> in the bolt carrier proceeds to actuate the camming stud in the bolt, rotating the bolt head out of engagement with the locking abutments in the receiver. The spent cartridge casing is extracted by a claw extractor contained in the bolt assembly while a protrusion on one of the internal bolt carrier guide rails in the upper receiver acts as the fixed ejector, removing the casing through a port {{on the right side of}} the receiver housing.|$|E
