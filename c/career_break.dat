5|$|Research for {{the film}} was done through {{available}} sources, such as online information and newspaper archives. Kom's videos {{played a key role}} in the research. The writer also had several telephone and email conversations with her regarding her biography. In her interactions with Quadras and Kumar, Kom was forthcoming when it came to the details of her life, and had significant input in the screenplay. However, Quadras revealed that his biggest challenge was to make the film authentic and cinematic yet not documentary-like, so he wrote the film in a manner that showed the struggles Kom went through as a female sportsperson who had to confront opposition from her father, politics and making a comeback after a long <b>career</b> <b>break.</b> The film only shows the period from her early struggles and her comeback after motherhood. Her fifth World Boxing Championship win and the London Olympics were left out because of the contract that permitted a depiction of Kom's life up to 2008. The contract {{for the film}} was signed at that time when Kom had not even qualified for the London Olympics.|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of the}} Fraunhofer project "Changing Company Cultures - Avoiding Career Breaks" is {{to develop}} new {{approaches}} {{on the basis of}} a comprehensive root cause analysis to avoid <b>career</b> <b>breaks</b> among women in management positions. As part of this, the project illustrates the importance of company culture for women's career opportunities: (1) The reasons for the <b>career</b> <b>breaks</b> of women in management positions can be found in the company-cultural framework conditions. The results show that individual measures are not sufficient to avoid <b>career</b> <b>breaks</b> by women. In order to increase the proportion of women in management positions, a comprehensive change in company culture is required. (2) The company-cultural factors identified as causes for <b>career</b> <b>breaks</b> by women are evident in varying degree from company to company. Not all companies are confronted by the same problem situation, but rather face culture-specific challenges. Four ideal-typical cultural patterns were identified. Their characteristics define the specific challenges to achieve the objective of "more women in management positions". As such, the four cultural patterns also provide starting points for the organisational-specific recommendations for action. The project was conducted by the Fraunhofer Society in collaboration with nine partner companies: Allianz Deutschland AG, BASF SE, Bayer AG, Bosch-Group, Daimler AG, Deutsche Bahn AG, EADS, Infineon Technologies AG and Microsoft...|$|R

John Goff of Daily Variety said the episode was well filmed and edited, and included a strong cast with performances [...] "above normal level of series work". Entertainment Weekly writer Bruce Fretts particularly praised Andre Braugher's performance: [...] "It's not often you actually witness a TV star being born...
