40|$|This paper {{examines}} intraday temporal {{relationships among}} arbitrage spreads, cash and futures price volatility, and <b>cash</b> <b>trading</b> volume, using transactions {{data for the}} Major Market Index futures contracts and the component stocks of the index. Results indicate that changes in the spread {{have a significant impact}} on cash and futures price volatility as well as on <b>cash</b> <b>trading</b> volume. The impact of the spread, however, is attenuated by the short-sale restriction in the cash market. Contrary to popular beliefs, a more volatile market leads to subsequent decreases in the spread, probably because of increases in the supply of arbitrage services or faster price adjustments. © 1993...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{potential}} contribution of cash market price manipulation to an option's value. When the underlying's transaction price follows an exogeneous fundamental process plus a price impact component influenced by trade, {{both sides of}} an option position may try to move the underlying cash price. Optimal <b>cash</b> <b>trading</b> strategies consist of a manipulation component and a liquidity provision for the other traders in the market. When the price impact is transitory, the optimal cash strategy may involve ``pre-liquidation'' of manipulative cash trades to reduce trading costs. We find that cash market manipulation can represent {{a significant portion of}} an option's value. The price impact of manipulation can be non-monotonic and the optimal <b>cash</b> <b>trading</b> strategy can be discontinuous in the number of longs and shorts. ...|$|E

40|$|The Market in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) aims to {{increase}} com-petition and to foster client {{protection in the}} European 8 ̆ 5 nancial market. Among other provisions, it abolishes the concentration rule and challenges the market power of existing trading venues. The directive introduces venue competition {{in order to achieve}} better execution and ultimately lower trading costs. In this paper I address the question of whether fostering competition between alternative trading venues alone may or not be able to impact actual competition in the market. I consider two reasons for why it may not: <b>cash</b> <b>trading</b> exhibits direct network e¤ects and the typical trading and post-trading bundling in the EU. I then propose an empiri-cal framework to evaluate the actual degree of competition between trading venues. This empirical approach constitutes, for the best of my knowledge, one of the 8 ̆ 5 rst attempts to structurally model 8 ̆ 5 nancial trading, which is instrumental for mea-suring empirically the impact of network e¤ects and of the bundle of trading and post-trading services as barriers to competition.

40|$|Under the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), in a one {{security}} and <b>cash</b> <b>trading</b> system, {{no one can}} outperform the buy-and-hold strategy in the long run. This classical proposition calls for a formal definition of outperforming trading rules. This article proposes a computational approach that completely departs from the probabilistic framework in which the question was originally formulated. Inspired by Schnorr’s definition of binary random string (Schnorr [Math. Syst. Theory, 1971, 5, 246 – 258]), computable functions are used to model effective trading rules {{that can be applied}} to financial price series. In the absence of transaction costs, a price sequence is said to be ‘unbeatable’, if no effective trading rule can generate indefinitely more profits than its buy-and-hold alternative. As a quantitative formulation of recent thoughts on EMH (e. g. Lo [J. Portfolio Manage., 2004, 30, 15 – 20], Kandhani and Lo [J. Invest. Manage., 2007, 5, 29 – 78], Hasanhodzic et al. [Quant. Financ., 2011, 11 (7), 1043 – 1050]), our definition reconsiders the notion of financial randomness and reconciles EMH with the performance of ‘constantly re-balanced portfolios ’ and ‘automated trading systems...|$|E

40|$|Small-scale grower (SSG) {{production}} in Mpumalanga province of South Africa has declined dramatically since the 2000 / 01 season. Tsb Sugar Ltd provided 811 consolidated remittance advice slips from the 2003 / 04 to 2006 / 07 seasons for analysis {{to obtain an}} insight into SSG financial returns. The results are indicative of the growers ’ annual <b>cash</b> <b>trading</b> account, and are expressed per unit of gross production to enable comparison. Results indicate that the sustainability of the sector is questionable, with 30 % of growers reliant on industry financial grants to generate a remuneration surplus. Scale economies do exist in the sector and a direct positive relationship exists between yield and unit returns. A grower’s choice of financial institution’s terms of trade has {{a significant impact on}} unit returns. Results show that declining yields may be a product of a reduced incentive to invest, brought about by continued poor terms of trade. Specific policy recommendations include improving performance by consolidating areas to take advantage of scale economies and increasing yields, and increasing the institutional savings to enable growers to ratoon their crops. Returns can be further improved, and sustainability enhanced, by restructuring current debt levels through lobbying financial institutions for debt restructuring...|$|E

Egg Clearinghouse, Inc. (ECI) provides a public forum for <b>cash</b> <b>trading,</b> intended to facilitate price discovery. Evidence from 1994 - 95 does not suggest that Umer Barry understates producer level prices on average.

Most eggs (90 - 95 %) are produced under contract trading on ECI, intended to influence the Urner or within integrated operations (ECI 1995), and Barry quotes, threatened to disrupt ECI's intended shell egg transactions from the producer level function as a price discovery mechanism (ECI through the retail level are typically priced by for- 1995).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays in empirical industrial organization. Chapter 1 introduces the three essays and describes their main results. In chapter 2, I examine consumer demand for variety. The consumption of a good typically creates satiation that diminishes the marginal utility of consuming more. This temporal satiation induces consumers to increase their stimulation level by seeking variety and therefore substitute towards other goods (substitutability across time) or other differentiated versions (products) of the good (substitutability across products). The literature on variety-seeking has developed along two strands, each focusing on only one type of substitutability. I specify a demand model that attempts to link these two strands of the literature. This issue is economically relevant because both types of substitutability are important for retailers and manufacturers in designing intertemporal price discrimination strategies. In chapter 3, which draws upon joint work with Peter Davis, we specify a new method of uncovering demand information from market level data on differentiated products. In particular, we propose a globally consistent continuous-choice demand model with distinct advantages over the models currently in use and describe the econometric techniques for its estimation. The proposed model combines key properties of both the discrete- and continuous-choice traditions: i) it is flexible {{in the sense of}} Diewert (1974), ii) it is globally consistent in the sense it can deal with entry and exit of products over time, and iii) incorporates a structural error term. In chapter 4, I examine market dominance and barriers to competition in financial trading venues. As of 1 November 2007, the Market in Financial Instruments Directive introduced venue competition in the European <b>cash</b> <b>trading</b> market. I argue that, although positive, the impact on the degree of actual competition may be limited due to two barriers to competition: i) direct network effects together with increasing returns to scale and ii) post-trading constraints...|$|E
