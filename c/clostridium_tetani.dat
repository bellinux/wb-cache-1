25|$|Tetanus {{is caused}} by the tetanus {{bacterium}} <b>Clostridium</b> <b>tetani.</b> Tetanus is an international health problem, as C.tetani spores are ubiquitous.

25|$|Tetanus* is {{a disease}} caused by the {{bacteria}} <b>Clostridium</b> <b>tetani</b> following wound contamination. Dogs are not very susceptible to tetanus. Signs include difficulty opening the mouth and eating, contraction of the facial muscles, and rigid extension of the limbs. Dogs may also get localized tetanus, signs of which include stiffness of a limb spreading {{to the rest of}} the body.|$|E
25|$|Tetanus {{is caused}} by an {{infection}} with the bacterium <b>Clostridium</b> <b>tetani,</b> which is commonly found in soil, saliva, dust, and manure. The bacteria generally enter through {{a break in the}} skin such as a cut or puncture wound by a contaminated object. They produce toxins that interfere with muscle contractions, resulting in the typical symptoms. Diagnosis is based on the presenting signs and symptoms. The disease does not spread between people.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clostridium</b> <b>tetani</b> is a rod-shaped, {{anaerobic}} {{species of}} pathogenic bacteria, {{of the genus}} Clostridium. Like other Clostridium genus species, it is Gram-positive, and its appearance on a gram stain resembles tennis rackets or drumsticks. C. tetani is found as spores in soil or in the gastrointestinal tract of animals. C. tetani produces a potent biological toxin, tetanospasmin, and is the causative agent of tetanus, a disease characterized by painful muscular spasms {{that can lead to}} respiratory failure and, in up to 10% of cases, death.|$|E
25|$|From about July 1942 {{to about}} September 1943, {{experiments}} {{to investigate the}} effectiveness of sulfonamide, a synthetic antimicrobial agent, were conducted at Ravensbrück. Wounds inflicted on the subjects were infected with bacteria such as Streptococcus, Clostridium perfringens (a major causative agent in gas gangrene) and <b>Clostridium</b> <b>tetani,</b> the causative agent in tetanus. Circulation of blood was interrupted by tying off blood vessels {{at both ends of}} the wound to create a condition similar to that of a battlefield wound. Infection was aggravated by forcing wood shavings and ground glass into the wounds. The infection was treated with sulfonamide and other drugs to determine their effectiveness.|$|E
500|$|Endospores show no {{detectable}} {{metabolism and}} can survive extreme {{physical and chemical}} stresses, such as high levels of UV light, gamma radiation, detergents, disinfectants, heat, freezing, pressure, and desiccation. In this dormant state, these organisms may remain viable for millions of years, and endospores even allow bacteria to survive exposure to the vacuum and radiation in space. According to scientist Dr. Steinn Sigurdsson, [...] "There are viable bacterial spores {{that have been found}} that are 40 million years old on Earth—and we know they're very hardened to radiation." [...] Endospore-forming bacteria can also cause disease: for example, anthrax can be contracted by the inhalation of Bacillus anthracis endospores, and contamination of deep puncture wounds with <b>Clostridium</b> <b>tetani</b> endospores causes tetanus.|$|E

50|$|In general, the {{treatment}} of clostridial infection is high-dose penicillin G, to which the organism has remained susceptible. Clostridium welchii and <b>Clostridium</b> <b>tetani</b> respond to sulfonamides. Clostridia are also susceptible to tetracyclines, carbapenems (imipenem), metronidazole, vancomycin, and chloramphenicol.|$|E

Phylogenetic analysis led to the identification of a monophyletic clade comprising characterized and predicted Na+-transporting PPases (Na+-PPases) within the K+-dependent subfamily. H+-transporting PPases (H+-PPases) are more heterogeneous and form at least three independent clades in both subfamilies.|$|E

There {{are several reasons}} for this: a snakebite may become infected, with the snake's saliva and fangs {{sometimes}} harboring pathogenic microbial organisms, including <b>Clostridium</b> <b>tetani.</b> Infection is often reported with viper bites whose fangs are capable of deep puncture wounds. Bites may cause anaphylaxis in certain people.|$|E
50|$|MenAfriVac is a {{freeze-dried}} vaccine of a polysaccharide from {{a type of}} Neisseria meningitidis called group A. The polysaccharide has been purified by affinity chromatography and bound to a carrier protein called tetanus toxoid.

50|$|Renshaw {{cells are}} also {{the target of the}} toxin of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>tetani,</b> a Gram positive, spore-forming {{anaerobic}} bacterium that lives in the soil. When wounds are contaminated with C. tetani, the toxin travels to the spinal cord where it inhibits the release of glycine, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, from Renshaw cells. As a result, alpha motor neurons become hyperactive, and muscles constantly contract.|$|E

50|$|Tetanus {{antitoxin}} is {{the protective}} antibody against <b>Clostridium</b> <b>tetani,</b> the bacterium that causes tetanus. The antibody develops after inoculation with tetanus toxin or toxoid or infection with <b>Clostridium</b> <b>tetani.</b> Tetanus toxoid {{should be given}} to infants from 6 to 8 weeks old, in three doses with 4 to 8 week intervals. Two more key doses should then be given at 6 to 12 months old and a later dose at the age of 4 to 6 before entering the schooling system. Tetanus toxoid is commonly given in combination with diphtheria toxoid acellular pertussis vaccine. The vaccine provides a protection against tetanus for at least 10 years. If an individual received all five doses, it is recommended that the individual get a single booster at the age of 50. Single boosters should be given if an individual has a tetanus prone wound and has not received the toxoid in the last 3 years.|$|E

50|$|Clostridial {{species are}} one of the major causes of food poisoning/gastrointestinal illnesses. They are anaerobic, gram-positive, spore-forming rods that occur {{naturally}} in the soil.

The use of toxins to damage the host is a method deployed by many bacterial pathogens.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are reports}} of shuriken being coated with poison, {{intended}} either as a throwing weapon or to be left in a conspicuous place for a victim to pick up. [...] Other reports indicate that shuriken may have been buried in dirt or animal feces and allowed to harbor the bacterium <b>Clostridium</b> <b>tetani</b> - if the point penetrated a victim deeply enough, the bacteria transferred into the wound could cause a then-incurable tetanus infection.|$|E

Well-known exotoxins include: botulinum toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum; Corynebacterium diphtheriae toxin, produced during life-threatening symptoms of diphtheria; tetanospasmin produced by <b>Clostridium</b> <b>tetani.</b> The toxic properties of most exotoxins can be inactivated by heat or chemical treatment {{to produce a}} toxoid. These retain their antigenic specificity {{and can be used}} to produce antitoxins and, in the case of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, are used as vaccines.|$|E
