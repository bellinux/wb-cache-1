25|$|Cotton Comes to Harlem: Based {{on a novel}} {{written by}} Chester Himes and {{directed}} by Ossie Davis. Features two black NYPD detectives: Coffin Ed Johnson (played by Raymond St. Jacques) and Gravedigger Jones (played by Godfrey Cambridge). They are on the hunt for a money-filled <b>cotton</b> <b>bale</b> stolen by a corrupt reverend named Deke O’Malley. Blazing Saddles star Cleavon Little makes an appearance in the film as well as comedian Redd Foxx in a role which led to his TV series Sanford & Son.|$|E
25|$|Land {{speculation}} was {{an important}} source of income as the first settlers sold out their claims for cash to newcomers and moved further west. The great majority of Kentuckians were farmers. They grew most of their own food, using the corn crop to feed hogs and to distill into whiskey. They obtained their cash from sales of burley tobacco, hemp, horses and mules. The hemp was spun and woven for <b>cotton</b> <b>bale</b> bagging and ropes. Tobacco was labor-intensive to cultivate; planters were attracted to Kentucky from Maryland and Virginia, where their own lands were near exhaustion from tobacco cultivation. Tobacco was a labor-intensive crop, and plantations in the Bluegrass region used slave labor, but on a smaller scale than the cotton plantations of the Deep South.|$|E
25|$|Sherman {{was able}} to {{concentrate}} his army faster than Beauregard had anticipated and arrived at Columbia {{on the afternoon of}} February 16. The only Confederates defending the city were small detachments from Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler's cavalry corps, Maj. Gen. Matthew Butler's cavalry division, and Lt. Gen. Stephen D. Lee's corps from the Army of Tennessee. Heavily outnumbered, Lt. Gen. Wade Hampton ordered an evacuation of the city without a fight, although they destroyed all bridges over the Congaree and Saluda Rivers in an attempt to delay the Union forces. Sherman occupied Columbia the following day. Much of Columbia burned to the ground in a fire that has engendered controversy ever since: some say it started when the Confederates set fire to cotton bales in the city, others say that drunken Union soldiers were fanning the flames of vengeance, while a few witnesses claimed that some of the fires were by accident. James W. Loewen researched the topic for his book, Lies Across America, and found that most likely, the <b>cotton</b> <b>bale</b> fires spread and caused most of the destruction. He did find that there were some fires started by Union soldiers, but the effects of these were minimal. Most likely, the Confederates' scorched earth policy was to blame for the burning of Columbia (in which not much of it burned). After the burning, Sherman was quoted as saying that he never gave the order to burn Columbia to the ground but he was not sorry that it happened.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is known}} as [...] "The Cottonbalers" [...] from an mythological {{incident}} cited during the Battle of New Orleans, while {{under the command of}} Andrew Jackson, when soldiers of the 7th Infantry Regiment held positions behind a breastwork of <b>bales</b> of <b>cotton</b> during the British attack. <b>Cotton</b> <b>bales</b> were in fact used on Line Jackson. <b>Cotton</b> <b>bales</b> were sunk into the mud to help create more stable platforms for cannons, not as breastworks.|$|R

Smith also landed a pair of 30-pounder Parrott guns, one from his flagship Rattler and the other from Forest Rose. He also sent ashore a 12-pounder howitzer. They were sited some 800 yards (730 m) from the fort, and were, like the guns in the fort, shielded by <b>cotton</b> <b>bales</b> covered with dirt.|$|R

50|$|Natchez {{has been}} the name of several steamboats, and four naval vessels, each named after the city of Natchez, Mississippi or the Natchez people. The current one has been in {{operation}} since 1975. The previous Natchez were all operated in the nineteenth century, most by Captain Thomas P. Leathers. Each of the steamboats since Leathers' first had as its ensign a <b>cotton</b> <b>bale</b> between its stacks.|$|E
50|$|The Distinctive Unit Insignia of the 7th Infantry, which {{consists}} of a <b>cotton</b> <b>bale</b> superimposed on two crossed bayonets, commemorates {{the role of the}} old 7th Infantry in the American victory at the Battle of New Orleans. The symbolism of the <b>cotton</b> <b>bale</b> derives from the fact that cotton bales, covered with mud, were sometimes incorporated into the defensive works behind which soldiers were positioned. But the old 7th Infantry is not in the lineage of the current 7th Infantry. In fact, none of the infantry regiments that were combined in 1815 to form the new 7th Infantry served at New Orleans. The old 7th Infantry is in the lineage of the current 1st Infantry. Indeed, the actions of the old 7th Infantry are noted in the section on the 1st Infantry above. The combined effects of the War Department Bulletins of June 11, 1923, and September 30, 1929, was to affirm that both the current 1st and 7th Infantry Regiments are entitled to claim credit for the campaigns earned by the old 7th Infantry during the War of 1812.|$|E

Over the next three months, he complained of back and chest pains, was subject to administrative segregation for refusing to work, and ultimately was treated for an irregular heartbeat.|$|E
50|$|The {{ecological}} {{benefits of}} the program are manifold; {{in addition to reducing}} pesticide use in the US, the fumigation of exported U.S. <b>cotton</b> <b>bales</b> with methyl bromide has also been significantly reduced. Fewer pesticide applications enable other insects to survive, including those that naturally prey on the boll weevil.|$|R

50|$|The fibers {{are used}} alone or blended with {{other types of}} fiber to make twine and rope. Jute butts, the coarse ends of the plants, are used to make {{inexpensive}} cloth. Conversely, very fine threads of jute can be separated out and made into imitation silk. As jute fibers are also being used to make pulp and paper, and with increasing concern over forest destruction for the wood pulp used to make most paper, the importance of jute for this purpose may increase. Jute {{has a long history of}} use in the sackings, carpets, wrapping fabrics (<b>cotton</b> <b>bale),</b> and construction fabric manufacturing industry.|$|E

It was also six boilers, but this one could hold 4,400 <b>cotton</b> <b>bales.</b> This one was used by Leathers until 1859. In 1860 it was destroyed while serving as a wharfboat at Baton Rouge, Louisiana.|$|R
50|$|After 1815 Milledgeville became {{increasingly}} prosperous and more respectable. Wealth and power gravitated toward the capital, {{and the surrounding}} countryside became {{caught up in the}} middle of a lucrative cotton boom as large plantations were developed, based on slave labor. <b>Cotton</b> <b>bales</b> regularly were set up to line the streets, waiting for shipping downriver to Darien.|$|R
