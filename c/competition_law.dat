5|$|By October 2007, Vildanden was {{in severe}} {{financial}} distress. An agreement {{was made with}} the municipal council, where the latter gave a credit loan to the airline. The route to Molde had given large deficits, and the company was forced to close it down. NOK2.3 million, equal to the airlines debt to the airport, was granted to the municipal-owned airport operator, and the company allowed to make an agreement where half the debt was deleted, {{and the other half}} made interest and principal-free for two years. At the same time, the management of Vildanden had to raise new capital equal to at least half the companies accounts payable, which was NOK8 million. The case raised local debate about whether it was the municipality's job to subsidize the airport and the airline.

5|$|In February 2013, {{planning}} permission for the redevelopment was granted. The {{cost of the}} project was estimated to be around £29.2million, of which £25.2million would come from government funding. It was initially planned for the work to begin in September 2013. Two months later however, Crusaders began legal proceedings against the redevelopment. The club called for the process to be judicially reviewed, believing it to be against European Union competition laws and also a form of State aid towards Linfield. When Crusaders played Linfield at Windsor Park at the end of April, their club officials were allegedly informed {{that they would not be}} welcome in the directors box or the boardroom during the game – an apparent reaction to Crusaders' legal challenge of the stadium redevelopment. In a hearing that took place on 22 May 2013, Crusaders' request was granted. It was ruled that it was a possibility for the redevelopment to be classed as state aid towards Linfield. The aspect of the challenge concerning <b>competition</b> <b>law</b> however, was dismissed.|$|E

5|$|Serving as Secretary of the Treasury in the {{administration}} of Rutherford B. Hayes, Sherman continued his efforts for financial stability and solvency, overseeing an end to wartime inflationary measures and a return to gold-backed money. He returned to the Senate after his term expired, serving there for a further sixteen years. During that time he continued his work on financial legislation, as well as writing and debating laws on immigration, business <b>competition</b> <b>law,</b> and the regulation of interstate commerce. Sherman was the principal author of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which was signed into law by President Benjamin Harrison. In 1897, President William McKinley appointed him Secretary of State. Failing health and declining faculties made him unable to handle the burdens of the job, and he retired in 1898 {{at the start of the}} Spanish–American War.

5|$|The {{government}} {{tried to}} enforce a controversial media law that would see Clarín lose licenses and be forced to sell most of its assets. The law was initially sanctioned as a <b>competition</b> <b>law</b> for the media, but critics pointed {{out that it is}} only being used to further the campaign against Clarín. The government had little interest in enforcing measures of the law that were not related to Clarín. Clarín launched a constitutional challenge against some articles of the law with the judiciary. The government released an anti-Clarín advertisement claiming it refused to obey the law and may be subverting democracy. The conflict led to disputes with the judiciary. Minister Julio Alak said that extending an injunction that allowed Clarín to keep its assets during the trial would be an insurrection, and it was rumored that judges who did not rule as the government wished might face impeachment. The court extended the inunction.|$|E

It is a study of whether antidumping laws should be replaced by either supra national (<b>Competition</b> <b>laws)</b> or harmonised domestic antitrust regimes, which penalise international predatory pricing without at the same time penalising non-predatory international price discrimination. It is suggested that progressive reforms of antidumping rules should become an agenda item of all future WTO Rounds and should focus on reconciling antidumping rules with antitrust treatment of predatory pricing practices. The progressive inclusion of antitrust criteria into WTO antidumping laws should be made a condition for progress in future WTO negotiations...|$|R
