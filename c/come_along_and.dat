He {{allows the}} {{remaining}} {{members of the}} posse to take the bullet-riddled bodies of the gang members back and collect the reward, while electing to stay behind, knowing what awaits the posse. After a period, Sykes arrives with a band of the previously seen Mexican rebels, who have killed off what's left of the posse along the way. Sykes asks Deke to <b>come</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> join the revolution. Deke smiles and rides off with them.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Ox, {{catching}} him alone, reveals Georges's true parentage, and persuades him {{to drink}} a magic potion {{that allows him to}} go beyond the limits of the probable and journey through the impossible. Eva, realizing what has happened, takes the potion and drinks some as well, so as not to desert Georges. A family friend, the dancing master Tartelet (from The School for Robinsons), is seduced by the opportunity to travel and drinks his own share of the potion before anyone can stop him. Ox sets off with all three travelers, while Volsius makes secret plans to <b>come</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> protect Georges from Ox's influence. Along the way, another Dane, Axel Valdemar, also gets mixed up into the journey and becomes a friend of Tartelet.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{theory can}} argue against the {{selection}} of the deferred gratification trait since there are both costs and risks associated with delaying gratification behavior. One such cost is the basic opportunity cost associated with time spent waiting. While waiting, individuals lose time {{that could be used to}} find other food. Seeking high calorie food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage. There are also two risks associated with being patient. First, there is a risk that another animal might get to the food first, also known as an interruption risk. Second, there is the risk that the chance to get the reward will be cut short, perhaps by a predator, also known as a termination risk. These costs and risks create situations in which the fitness of the individual is threatened. There are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in the real world. For example, animals that eat fruit have the option of eating unripe fruit right away, or waiting, delaying gratification, until it becomes ripe. The interruption risk plays a part here, because if the individual forgoes the unripe fruit, there is a chance that another individual may <b>come</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> get to it first. Also, in extractive foraging, such as with nuts and shellfish, the outer shell creates a delay. However, animals that can store food and defer eating are more likely to survive during harsh conditions, and thus delaying gratification may also incur an evolutionary advantage.|$|E

25|$|This {{plan was}} ready to be set in action in early March 1864, after {{somewhat}} belated communication initiated by Banks to inform Sherman and Porter of their roles in Halleck's strategy. Banks sent Sherman, Halleck, and Porter a report prepared by Major David Houston clearly showing the near impossibility of maintaining an occupation in Shreveport and east Texas without major resources. Most of Banks' men, accompanied by a large, poorly trained, cavalry force would march north toward the middle river. Banks would allow cotton speculators to <b>come</b> <b>along,</b> <b>and</b> Porter was bringing barges to collect cotton as lucrative naval prizes.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} Augusta National {{originated}} with Bobby Jones, {{who wanted to}} build a golf course after his retirement from the game. He sought advice from Clifford Roberts, who later became the chairman of the club. They came across a piece of land in Augusta, Georgia, of which Jones said: [...] "Perfect!

500|$|Dick Irvin once {{compared}} the styles of Syl Apps, previous {{captain of the}} Leafs, to Kennedy in how the two centres used their wingers. [...] "Apps used to hit the defense at top speed and Gordie Drillon would <b>come</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> pick up the garbage", said Irvin, whereas Kennedy would [...] "go into the corners and get the puck out to their wings." [...] Hap Day had said he could see Nels Stewart's influence on Kennedy. Like Stewart, Kennedy had a more upright lie on his hockey stick which kept the puck closer to his feet. Kennedy was also widely {{believed to be the}} best faceoff man in hockey and seldom lost an important faceoff. Along with his regular shift, he also played a role on the penalty kill.|$|E
500|$|Between 1970 and 1971, {{both the}} singles [...] "Louisiana Man" [...] and [...] "Where Is My Castle" [...] became top 20 hits on the Billboard Magazine country singles chart. In 1971 Smith's cover of Don Gibson's 1960 single [...] "Just One Time" [...] reached No.2 on the Hot Country Singles chart. An {{album of the}} same name was also released, which reached No.20 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. By the early 1970s, Smith started to {{incorporate}} more Gospel music into her regular studio albums and touring show. Smith later stated that by incorporating more Gospel music into her secular recording career would make her leap into Christianity [...] "count". In 1971, she released her third gospel album, <b>Come</b> <b>Along</b> <b>and</b> Walk with Me, which Smith later stated was her favorite gospel record out of the many she has made.|$|E

500|$|As a {{breeding}} stallion, Go Man Go {{continued to have}} {{a reputation as a}} scoundrel, although Kathlyn Green, wife of A. B. Green, disputed that image. She said that he liked to have his lip tugged, and would lean over the stall door waiting for people to <b>come</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> tug on it for him. However, she said of him [...] "he absolutely hated getting his feet dirty". Go Man Go passed through a number of hands after Green owned him, including Les Gosselin, Frank Vessels, and Harriett Peckham, who was his owner by 1972. In 1967, when Vessels sold his half-interest in Go Man Go to Briarwood Farms, the deal was said to be a record price for a Quarter Horse. Go Man Go died in 1983 and was buried near the headquarters of the Buena Suerte Ranch in Roswell, New Mexico. His crown-shaped granite headstone is engraved: [...] "Go Man Go, The King." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 2008 United States presidential election, Eastwood {{stated that}} he would be voting for John McCain, citing {{the fact that he had}} known McCain since he {{returned}} to the US in 1973 as a recently released POW. Eastwood said of McCain: [...] "I met him years ago when he first came back from Vietnam. This was back when (Ronald) Reagan was the governor of California and he had a big function for all of the prisoners of war who were released. I thought he was a terrific guy, a real American hero." [...] Nevertheless, Eastwood wished Barack Obama well upon his subsequent victory saying, [...] "Obama is my president now and I am going to be wishing him the very best because it is what is best for all of us." [...] Eastwood stated in 2010 of President Obama: [...] "I think he's a nice fella and I enjoyed watching him <b>come</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> I enjoyed watching him campaign and win the job.

500|$|Similar to {{the process}} for Yield and Binaural, band members worked on {{material}} individually before starting the recording sessions together. According to Cameron, everyone in the band had [...] "four or five" [...] ideas coming into the sessions, and there was [...] "a lot to just kind of weed through and work on." [...] The band often recorded material intended to be demo recordings, but lead vocalist Eddie Vedder would <b>come</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> record his vocals afterwards, stating, [...] "I just sang it, that's the take." [...] Regarding the creative process, guitarist Stone Gossard said that while playing alone [...] "the anal-retentive side of you goes, 'I think I could play better.'", but when reuniting [...] "the entire band goes 'No, it's great as it is,' then you just get in the mood and embrace it." [...] Gossard stated that [...] "the process of letting go is constant in this band", adding that bandmembers would arrive with [...] "a clear idea of what a song is going to be" [...] but eschew for other musical ideas while discussing the song with the group. Riot Act was the first Pearl Jam album to feature Kenneth [...] "Boom" [...] Gaspar on Keyboards, most notably on the song [...] "Love Boat Captain". According to Gaspar, the song initially developed out of a jam session he had with Vedder in Hawaii shortly after the two first met. When they were done, Vedder asked Gaspar if he was [...] "ready to go to Seattle." [...] According to Gossard, bringing in Gaspar was about being [...] "open to new things," [...] while Vedder stated Gaspar [...] "was able to find his place" [...] and fit in easily with the band dynamics. Guitarist Mike McCready {{said that he had}} always wanted the band to feature keyboards.|$|E
