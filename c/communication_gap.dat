40|$|Background: When {{it comes}} to brand <b>communication,</b> <b>gaps</b> can arise. These occur when the brand management’s view of the brand does not match the customers’ Brand image. In order to prevent {{reputation}} crises brand managements need to monitor the Brand identity and Brand image and identify possible gaps. Purpose: To identify and analyse what <b>communication</b> <b>gaps</b> that can occur between a company’s Brand identity and customers’ Brand image. Research question: What <b>communication</b> <b>gaps</b> can occur between a company’s Brand identity and the customers’ Brand image? Theory: Marketing Communication, Sender-Receiver model, Brand image and Brand identity focusing on Personality, Positioning, Vision & Culture and Relationship. Method: A case study of the Swedish food company Coop was conducted to investigate the relationship between their Brand identity and the customers’ Brand image. The case {{study was conducted in}} two steps; firstly, information concerning Coop’s Brand identity was gathered through in-depth interviews. Secondly, a questionnaire was handed out to Coop’s customers to see whether their Brand image was consistent with Coop’s Brand identity. The aim was to find similarities and dissimilarities between data and thereby identify <b>communication</b> <b>gaps.</b> Results: Several <b>communication</b> <b>gaps</b> were identified between Coop’s Brand identity and the customers’ Brand image {{when it came to the}} concepts of Personality, Positioning, Vision & Culture and Relationship. Coop experiences most <b>communication</b> <b>gaps</b> in Relationship, they has not managed to create close relationships with their customers...|$|R

Uemura was not very fond of cleaning toilets, so her grandmother told her that a beautiful goddess lives in the toilet, if she cleaned it every day, this goddess would make her into a beautiful woman. As Uemura grew older, the <b>communication</b> <b>gap</b> between her and her grandmother worsened and the two grew apart.

[...] A simple and conservative sort, Head of State Cemal Gürsel became Turkey's most popular figure, forbade display of his picture alongside Atatürk's in government offices, rode about in an open Jeep touring rural communities, talking to the peasants almost as if they were his children (Time, 6 January 1961). He was successful with his personal interventions in reducing the number of execution verdicts from the Yassıada tribunals from 15 down to three. Gürsel's plea for forgiveness and attempts along with several other world leaders for the reversal of the execution sentences and for the release of Adnan Menderes and two other ministers were rejected by the Junta. A member of the National Unity Committee writes in his memoirs that, upon Cemal Gürsel's intervention on the prevention of Menderes' execution, the chief prosecutor of the tribunal, Altay Ömer Egesel, said: ‘Let us hurry! They will save him (Menderes)!’, also arranging a contingency plan for conducting the execution in a Navy Destroyer {{in the event of a}} forgiveness operation in Imrali Island to save Menderes while, at the same time, placing a press release questioning the legal ability of Gürsel for an intervention.

40|$|Communication is {{essential}} for software development as its efficiency throughout the entire project life-cycle is {{a key factor in}} developing and releasing successful software products to the market. This paper reports on findings from an explanatory case study aiming at {{a deeper understanding of the}} causes and effects of <b>communication</b> <b>gaps</b> in a large-scale industrial set up. Based on an assumption of what causes <b>gaps</b> in <b>communication</b> of requirements and what effects such gaps have, a semi-structured interview study was performed with nine practitioners at a large market-driven software company. We found four main factors that affect the requirements communication, namely scale, temporal aspects, common views and decision structures. The results also show that <b>communication</b> <b>gaps</b> lead to failure to meet the customers’ expectations, quality issues and wasted effort. An increased awareness of these factors is a help in identifying what to address to achieve a more efficient requirements management, and ultimately more efficient and successful software development. By closing the <b>communication</b> <b>gaps</b> the requirements may continue all the way through the project life-cycle and be more likely to result in software that meets the customers’ expectations...|$|R
