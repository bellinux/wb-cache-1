5000|$|On June 30, 2013, Congressman Filemon Vela, Jr. {{resigned}} from the CHC, citing opposition to the Senate immigration bill which the CHC endorsed, saying: [...] "Opponents of serious immigration reform are extracting a pound of flesh in this process by conditioning a pathway to citizenship {{on the construction of}} more ineffective border fence." [...] The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has received support over the years from Mexican billionaire, Ricardo Pliego and Azteca America. [...] Andres Ramirez, a Nevada political consultant, and Kevin de Leon, the President Pro Tempore of the California State Senate, have worked together to get money from Azteca America to various caucus groups and political campaigns, as Pliego is a known rival to Carlos Slim, whom both deLeon and Ramirez have attacked through the use of phony groups such as Two Countries One Voice. Ramirez has appeared at functions for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. The effort to recruit past students and fellows involved in programs of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus causes some political bloggers to speculate over the effort by California State Senator Deleon and his colleague California State Senator Jim Beall to use their legislative staffs, some of whom have been involved in programs of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, to take over several local groups of California Democratic Party State Central <b>Committee</b> <b>delegations</b> for the purpose of establishing control for deLeon and his allies.|$|E

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{contribution}} that the European Parliament’s standing <b>committees,</b> <b>delegations</b> and inter-parliamentary assemblies make as diplomatic actors in the post-Lisbon Treaty period. These three types of bodies and institutions are grouped together, because in practice they work in complementary ways. The committees play a coordinating role, the delegations act as ‘embassies on the move’ and {{the participation of the}} European Parliament in inter-parliamentary assemblies represents the clearest institutional sign of the European Parliament’s external action. The {{article focuses on}} a case study: the involvement of the European Parliament in the EU’s partnership with the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of countries (ACP) through the Development Committee (DEVE), the competent European Parliament delegation, and the activities within the Joint Parliamentary Assembly. The article aims to analyse whether and how the European Parliament is able to play a distinctive diplomatic role through its standing <b>committees,</b> <b>delegations</b> and inter-parliamentary assemblies...|$|R
