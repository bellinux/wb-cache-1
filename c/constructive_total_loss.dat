5|$|She was {{subsequently}} refloated on 5 July and towed {{back to the}} UK. The subsequent survey declared her a <b>constructive</b> <b>total</b> <b>loss,</b> and the ship was sold to Thos W Ward by BISCO. Fury was towed Briton Ferry to be scrapped, arriving there on 18 September 1944.|$|E
5|$|The repairs were {{abandoned}} in March 1945 {{for lack of}} materials and the ship was moved from the dock to Ebisu Bay, Sasebo on 1 April. Efforts to camouflage the ship began on 23 April and she was reclassified as a guard ship on 20 June. Junyōs armament was ordered removed on 5 August and the ship was surrendered to the Allies on 2 September. An American technical team evaluated the ship's condition on 8 October and deemed her a <b>constructive</b> <b>total</b> <b>loss.</b> Junyō was stricken from the Navy List on 30 November and scrapped between 1 June 1946 and 1 August 1947 by the Sasebo Ship Company.|$|E

5000|$|The Bay class {{made use}} of the hull, machinery, lattice mast and {{superstructure}} of incomplete Loch class frigates. The armament was altered to suit them to the A/A role, with twin QF 4 in Mark XVI guns fore and aft in mounts HA/LA Mark XIX fitted with remote power control (RPC), controlled by a rangefinder-director Mark V carried on the bridge and fitted with radar Type 285 for range taking. Due to a shortage of supply of 4 in guns and mountings, many ships had these removed from laid up V and W class destroyer [...] "WAIR" [...] conversions and Hunt class destroyers that were <b>constructive</b> <b>total</b> <b>losses.</b> A pair of Mark V [...] "utility" [...] mounts for twin 40 mm Bofors guns were sited amidships, {{each with its own}} predictive Simple Tachymetric Director (STD) for fire control. The A/A armament was completed by a pair of mounts Mark V for twin 20 mm Oerlikon guns, carried in the bridge wings. Later, the Oerlikons were replaced with single mounts Mark VII for Bofors guns, a further pair of which were added amidships on raised platforms. For A/S use, a Hedgehog projector was carried on the fo'c'sle and the quarterdeck carried two racks and four throwers for up to 50 depth charges.|$|R
50|$|On June 2, 1991 a fire {{broke out}} onboard while the ship was in Venice, {{preparing}} to depart on a product exhibition cruise for Bosch. She partially sank in the shallow waters, and was declared a <b>total</b> <b>constructive</b> <b>loss</b> for the second time. In August {{of the same year}} she was towed to Pireus where she was laid up {{for the next three years}} awaiting buyers. Finally in 1994 a buyer emerged. The Greece-based Strintzis Line purchased the ship and renamed her Ionian Express, with intention to rebuild her as a car-passenger ferry for their Swansea Cork Ferries (although officially renamed Ionian Express, this name was never painted on her hull). A {{fire broke out}} in her engine room while the rebuilding at Perama, Greece, and for a third time the ship was declared a <b>total</b> <b>constructive</b> <b>loss.</b> No further buyers were found to restore the ill-fated ship, and she was towed to the scrapyard in Aliağa, Turkey, on 29 March 1995, and was subsequently broken up. Her engines were sold to Med Link Line and installed on their M/S Agios Andreas.|$|R
2500|$|On 14 October 1944 Magog joined Convoy ONS 33G in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. At 1925 local time, Magog was torpedoed {{and damaged}} by U-1223 near Pointe-des-Monts, Quebec (near Baie-Trinité, Quebec), losing [...] of her stern, killing 3 crew and {{injuring}} 3 others. After the torpedoing, Magog {{was taken in}} tow first by , then [...] {{to the safety of}} a bay, and later to Quebec by the salvage tug Lord Strathcona where she was eventually declared a <b>total</b> <b>constructive</b> <b>loss.</b> The crew was ordered not to discuss the action at the time by the Prime Minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King.|$|R
25|$|Renamed Empire Commerce, {{she served}} until 9 June 1940 when she struck a mine off Margate, Kent.

5|$|Extensive {{damage was}} found by the diver's {{preliminary}} examination of the ship, including tearing and inch-sized gaps in Astrids hull, as well as popped rivets and spread plates. The salvage company Blue Ocean, of Castletownbere, were appointed to recover the ship. The plans for the salvage operation consisted of removing around 3.5 tonnes of diesel fuel from the ship's fuel tanks, pumping {{water out of the}} ship and cutting away equipment including the rigging and masts, before a floating crane lifted the vessel from the rocks. The ship would then be taken to a nearby port to be handed over to the insurers. As of the end of July 2013 it was thought that the ship will never sail again, and that she would be written off as a <b>total</b> <b>constructive</b> <b>loss.</b> A month after sinking, Astrid was still under water.|$|R
500|$|The Yugoslav {{destroyer}} Ljubljana was {{the third}} and last Beograd-class destroyer built for the Royal Yugoslav Navy ( [...] , KJRM) during the late 1930s. Her main armament consisted of four Škoda [...] guns. In 1940, she ran aground on a reef off the Yugoslav port of Šibenik. Badly damaged, she was taken to port for repairs. She was still under repair when Yugoslavia was drawn into World War II by the German-led Axis invasion of that country in April 1941. Ljubljana was captured by the Italians, and after repairs were completed, saw active service in the Royal Italian Navy under the name Lubiana, mainly as a convoy escort on routes between Italy and the Aegean and North Africa. She was sunk or stranded off the Tunisian coast on 1 April 1943 and declared a <b>total</b> <b>constructive</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|R
25|$|Captain-class frigates {{acted in}} {{the roles of}} convoy escorts, anti-submarine warfare vessels, coastal forces control frigates and {{headquarters}} ships for the Normandy landings.

25|$|In 1969, Princess Italia {{began to}} operate cruises in Alaska, and {{continued}} both itineraries until 1973, when Crociere d'Oltremare canceled her charter to Princess. She was subsequently chartered to Costa Cruises, who changed her name back to Italia and operated her on cruises out of San Juan, Puerto Rico. In 1977 Costa purchased {{the ship and}} began chartering her to various companies. This ended in 1983 when Costa sold Italia to Ocean Cruise Line. Ocean Cruise Line renamed her Ocean Princess and had her do cruises in the Mediterranean during the summer, and in the Caribbean and Latin America during the winter. In March 1993, while cruising through the Amazon, the Ocean Princess struck a sunken wreck on the river bottom, causing her engine room and lower decks to flood. All passengers and crew were rescued unharmed, but the ship herself was declared a <b>Total</b> <b>Constructive</b> <b>Loss.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1946, Empire Buckler {{was sold}} to Houlder Bros and renamed Ovingdean Grange. She served Houlder's until 1959 when she {{was sold to}} Devon Shipping Co, Liberia, and renamed Sabrina.

25|$|Empire Chelsea. She {{was built}} for the Ministry of War Transport (MoWT). In 1947 she was sold and renamed Humbergate. Another sale in 1955 saw her renamed Springwear. In 1959, she was sold and renamed Lynnwear. In 1962 she was sold to Panama and renamed Dumbo. In 1968 she was arrested in Spain and sold by Court Order. She then ran aground and the sale was {{cancelled}} after the ship was declared a <b>constructive</b> <b>total</b> <b>loss.</b> Another sale resulted in plans to turn her into a floating nightclub, but these failed to come to fruition and she was scrapped c1970.|$|E
25|$|There was {{diesel oil}} leaking into the ocean. The {{concerned}} agencies were informed, and a salvage operation was attempted. On 23 May 2003 RMS Mülheim was declared a <b>constructive</b> <b>total</b> <b>loss.</b> The salvage work {{was provided by}} the leading company Wijsmuiler Salvage. To remove as much cargo as possible, a conveyor belt system was used. When the weather and tide permitted, workers on the wreck filled jumbo-sized bags with the ship's cargo. Those bags were then brought up the cliff by the conveyor, which had been placed on the cliff just above the wreck. The operation ended on 29 May 2003. Although most of the cargo was removed, some was lost to the ocean.|$|E
500|$|She was {{commissioned}} into the Royal Italian Navy {{under the name}} Lubiana in October, or November 1942. She served as an escort during 1942–43, operating on the Tunisian supply route {{from the beginning of}} 1943. From 9 February to 22 March 1943, Lubiana participated in a series of troop transport convoys for the German and Italian armies in North Africa. She was then involved in escorting another series of convoys to Tunisia commencing on 27 March. Sources vary regarding her exact fate. According to Roger Chesneau, she was sunk off the Tunisian coast by British aircraft on 1 April 1943, but Maurizio Brescia states she was stranded off Cap Bon on the Tunisian coast on the same day and declared a <b>total</b> <b>constructive</b> <b>loss.</b> David Brown records that she was stranded in bad weather about 04:00 on 1 April approximately [...] east of Ras El Ahmar while entering the Gulf of Tunis, and was abandoned after damage by heavy seas.|$|R
5000|$|While her {{forepart}} planted {{firmly on}} the shelving shore her stern was floating in 30 feet of water. As the tide fell the stern lost its support causing the ship to become severely hogged. Her seams opened, and about her midship sections the height between decks was reduced from over 6 feet (1.8 m) to less than 4 feet (1.2 m). [...] "Conditions on board were very bad with the after end of the ship from the mainmast sagging downwards, and the continuous sound of cracking, twisting, rending timber and rushing water below." [...] When the next tide made the stern failed to lift and the ship flooded freely through her open seams. Being evident that further attempts to tow the ship off would be to no purpose, the tugs were discharged and left for Liverpool the following morning. Two days after the grounding, in the evening of 16 April 1953, surveyors declared Conway a <b>total</b> <b>constructive</b> <b>loss.</b> The ship was not insured.|$|R
50|$|In September 1944, Vegreville {{returned}} to Canada and underwent a refit at Sydney. Following its completion, {{the ship was}} ordered back to the UK, arriving in February 1945. She joined the 31st Minesweeping Flotilla after returning to the UK. In April 1945, the 31st Minesweeping Flotilla joined the last large-scale combined operation in the European theatre in an attack on German naval bases in France {{that had been left}} untouched by Allied war effort to that point. Departing Plymouth on 12 April, the 31st Minesweeping Flotilla began operations in the mouth of the Gironde estuary on 14 April. They completed their duties on 16 April, unmolested by the Germans. While returning to Plymouth, the flotilla encountered a German trawler and captured it. On 23 April 1945 she suffered severe damage to her port engine in the English Channel off France and was forced to return to port. Once there she was declared a <b>total</b> <b>constructive</b> <b>loss</b> and beyond economical repair. She was paid off on 6 June 1945 and laid up at Falmouth. The ship remained there until taken to Hayle in May 1947 to be broken up.|$|R
25|$|In 1962, Lynnwear {{was sold}} to the South Star Corporation, Panama and renamed Dumbo. She was placed under the {{management}} of V & J A Ensenat, Spain. In October 1968, Dumbo was placed under arrest at Las Palmas. She was later sold at auction by Court Order. The winning bidder was Naviera del Odiel, SA. However, on 24 November 1968 she was driven ashore at Las Palmas. The ship was declared a <b>constructive</b> <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> and the offer for purchase of the ship was withdrawn by Naviera de Odiel. Ownership of the ship was assumed by the Port Authority at Las Palmas. Dumbo was refloated in May 1969 and beached. She was sold by auction on 10 December 1969. Her new owner intended to convert her to a floating nightclub but the plans were abandoned. The ship was eventually sold to Don Martin Juantey Malvarez and scrapped c1970.|$|E
500|$|Ben-my-Chrees wreck {{remained}} {{in place until}} 1920 when it was refloated by the salvage ship Vallette and towed to the port of Piraeus. The ship {{proved to be a}} <b>constructive</b> <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> and was broken up in Venice, Italy in 1923.|$|E
500|$|Sevastopol (...) {{was built}} by Shipyard No. 200, 61 Communards in Nikolayev. She was laid down on 5 November 1939 and {{estimated}} as 11.6% complete on 22 June 1941. She was captured by the Germans when they occupied Nikolayev in late 1941, but the Germans did little with her other than {{to use some of}} her material for defensive positions and some was apparently shipped to Germany. Before the Germans evacuated the city they damaged her building slip and hull with explosives and made her a <b>constructive</b> <b>total</b> <b>loss.</b> She was ordered scrapped on 24 March 1947 and her dismantling began shortly afterwards. It was completed in 1948.|$|E
5000|$|A {{dramatic}} nearby shipwreck was {{unrelated to}} {{the operation of the}} lighthouse. The veteran passenger liner La Janelle, once removed from her role as a cruise liner, lay at anchor off Port Hueneme on April 14, 1970 awaiting plans for conversion to a floating restaurant and fun palace. The owners were attempting to cut down on moorage costs by leaving the vessel at anchor in the open ocean, directly offshore. That was a bad mistake. With only one watchman aboard, the vessel fell victim to storm-tossed seas which rose to huge activities, causing the 465 ft ship to slip her anchor cables. In a dramatic episode of the sea, rescue parties managed to snatch the watchman from the deck, but the 40-year-old vessel, like a wounded whale, was tossed unceremoniously onto the beach, a <b>total</b> <b>constructive</b> <b>loss.</b> The California State Lands Commission became much concerned about the problem both from the standpoint of leaking oil and a menace to navigation. They voted unanimously to have the ship scrapped, [...] "as is, where is," [...] and accordingly put out bids. The big steel ship still remains but is being torn apart bit by bit by human and natural elements.|$|R
25|$|Empire Morn {{shifted to}} warmer waters the {{following}} year, and in April 1943 she joined convoy OS/KMS 46 bound for Gibraltar via Casablanca. She {{was carrying a}} cargo of equipment destined for naval, army and RAF forces. She arrived at Casablanca on 25 April 1943, and then set off for Gibraltar, and on 26 April 1943, at , she struck a mine that had been laid by U-117 on 10 April. A secondary explosion damaged the stern and blew out much of the crew accommodation. When the order was given to abandon ship, a head count of crew found 21 men missing. Among them was the 14-year old galley boy Raymond Steed. Steed's body was found two days later, and he became the second youngest person in the British services {{to die in the}} war. He was 14 years and 207 days old. It was thought that he was the youngest wartime service casualty until February 2010, when it was confirmed Reginald Earnshaw was actually younger, at 14 years and 152 days. The damaged Empire Morn was towed back into Casablanca, where she was expected to be declared a <b>total</b> <b>constructive</b> <b>loss.</b> She was however refloated and towed to Gibraltar, eventually arriving on 1 September 1943.|$|R
