50|$|In {{grinding}}, {{the wheel}} follows a simple path. For example, in plunge grinding a shaft, the wheel moves in towards {{the axis of}} the <b>part,</b> <b>grinds</b> it, and then moves back out. Since each slice of the wheel repeatedly contacts the same slice of the workpiece, any inaccuracies in the geometric shape of the grinding wheel will be transferred onto the part. Therefore, {{the accuracy of the}} finished workpiece geometry is limited to the accuracy of the truing dresser. The accuracy becomes even worse as the grind wheel wears, so truing must occur periodically to reshape it.|$|R

40|$|Casting {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{versatile}} manufacturing processes, given that it allows the manufacturing of complex geometry parts of different dimensions and made of several materials like cast iron, steel, brass or aluminium among others. Usually, casting is analyzed from the standpoint of the particularities of the process as well as from the characteristics of the parts that are obtained. Nevertheless, manufacturing implies the use of resources like materials and energy, with the production of the desired part but also with the generation of wastes and atmospheric emissions. In this work, a study about the necessary requirements for the sustainability of a foundry is presented. Also, the main wastes generated at the different phases of the process are analyzed (used sand, rejected metallic <b>parts,</b> <b>grinding</b> powder, etc.) as well as the way to minimize, reuse or recover those wastes according to the concept of “clean production”. It should be noticed that environmental rules are becoming more restrictive and therefore waste management costs are increasing...|$|R

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} process of metal parts {{is subjected to}} machining instabilities that can degrade the surface finish quality and the reliability of products. Some instabilities are of transient nature and traditional inspection systems are unable to adequately estimate the grade of affectation in the finished parts. Time-frequency analyses are techniques that overcome these limitations and have recently been incorporated in special industry inspection equipment {{to improve the quality}} of the manufactured <b>parts.</b> <b>Grinding</b> is a process used to get high precision and very smooth surface in flat or cylindrical parts because of the target applications such as the automotive industry where the highest standards can be found. This paper reports a technique to estimate the quality of ground parts based on timefrequency transforms that are used to enhance the defects. This makes it easier to implement the technique for surface characterization in online pass/no-pass inspection machines. The fundamentals of the methodology are revised and the technique is applied to the identification of vibration marks in cylindrical ground rods. Results show that this approach identifies adequately imperfections of transient nature and it is able to estimate the extension and amplitude of the defects on the surface of the manufactured parts...|$|R

40|$|Micro ceramic {{parts are}} used in electronics, {{medicine}} and MEMS for different purposes such as isolators, rigid supports and biocompatible components. Furthermore ceramics are increasingly used as a tool material since high hardness combined with inert surface properties against lubricants qualify them for micro stamping and forming tools. Especially polycristalline diamonds have a growing market in micro stamping and forming applications with tool geometries < 100 m and accuracies < 10 m at surface qualities 2 m. Mostly ceramics are processed by high precision grinding but for 3 -dimensional <b>parts</b> <b>grinding</b> processes do not offer the possibilities for small and complex geometries. Here laser ablation offers new possibilities by selective processing of all kind of technical ceramics. Using frequency tripled Nd:YAG-Lasers at wavelength of = 355 nm structures with single size geometries less that 10 m can be produced. For the manufacturing of 3 -D-parts and processing of mi cro structures on larger 3 D-Parts a multi-axes machine with 5 moving axes for the parts and additionally 2 scanning axes for fast laser movements have been set up. With this system different ceramic parts have been processed using a 5 W frequency tripled high repetition rate Nd:YAG-Laser. Optimum accuracies and surface qualities have been achieved using scanning strategies with varying scanning angles for subsequent ablation layers, a combination of contour mode and form filling scanning ablation. For a further increase of surface qualities in terms of roughness a combination of ablation and polishing using different laser parameters has been used leading to surface roughness < 0, 5 m at polycrystalline diamond...|$|R

In this paper, we describe a new extension to DDP that helps to disentangle these flows, permitting more precise results.
