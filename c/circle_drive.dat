The parks would be connected by a 23.5-mile (37.8-km) Fort <b>Circle</b> <b>Drive,</b> but these plans never made it off the drawing board, due to budget concerns and the political issues involved. Though many of the forts—including Fort Greble—did become parks, they were not connected in a grand plan surrounding Washington.
