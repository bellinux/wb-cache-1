His hard, straight four-seam fastball averages about , topping out at , and {{sets up a}} deceptive changeup in the high 70s to low 80s. Periodically, he throws a cutter early in the count to right-handed hitters and a curveball in the mid 70s. Nardi Contreras, who worked with Clippard as the Yankees' minor league pitching coordinator, indicated that Clippard's greatest success <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> curveball and changeup.|$|E
5|$|Most of what {{is known}} of Du Fu's life <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> poems. His {{paternal}} grandfather was Du Shenyan, a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu. Du Fu was born in 712; the exact birthplace is unknown, except that it was near Luoyang, Henan province (Gong county is a favourite candidate). In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family.|$|E
5000|$|A {{thousand}} limbs {{are integral}} to the Indian tradition: the Puruṣa sūkta of the Ṛgveda, for instance, describes the cosmic man Puruṣa as having [...] "a thousand heads ... a thousand eyes, a thousand feet." [...] Notably, the Kāraṇḍavyūha Sūtra contains a Buddhist adaptation of the Vedic Puruṣa myth, with Avalokiteśvara as the all-pervasive cosmic being from whose body springs various gods:"Āditya and Candra <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> eyes, Maheśvara <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> forehead, Brahmā <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> shoulders, Nārāyaṇa <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> heart, Devi Sarasvatī <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> canines, Vāyu <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> mouth, Dharaṇī <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> feet, and Varuṇa <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> stomach." ...|$|R

5|$|Mr. Bean {{often seems}} unaware of basic {{aspects of the}} way the world works, and the {{programme}} usually features his attempts at what would normally be considered simple activities, such as going swimming, using a television set, interior decorating, or going to church. The humour largely <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> original (and often absurd) solutions to problems and his total disregard for others when solving them, his pettiness, and occasional malevolence.|$|E
5|$|Byard {{played with}} trumpeter Maynard Ferguson {{in the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, {{and was a member}} of bands led by bassist Charles Mingus for several years, {{including}} on several studio and concert recordings. The first of his recordings as a leader was in 1960, but, despite being praised by critics, his albums and performances did not gain him much wider attention. In his 60-year career, Byard recorded at least 35 albums as leader, and more than 50 as a sideman. Byard's influence on the music <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> combining of musical styles during performance, and his parallel career in teaching.|$|E
5|$|Craig {{was born}} in Chester, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia (née Williams), was an art teacher, and his father, Timothy John Wroughton Craig, was the {{landlord}} of the pubs Ring o' Bells in Frodsham, Cheshire and the Boot Inn in Tarporley, Cheshire, having served as a midshipman in the Merchant Navy. Craig has distant French Huguenot and Welsh ancestry. Huguenot minister Daniel Chamier is among his ancestors, as is Sir William Burnaby, 1st Baronet. Craig's middle name, Wroughton, <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> great-great-grandmother, Grace Matilda Wroughton.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the extant}} {{information}} about {{the last few days}} of Poe's life <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> attending physician, Dr. John Joseph Moran, though his credibility is questionable. Poe was buried after a small funeral at the back of Westminster Hall and Burying Ground, but his remains were moved to a new grave with a larger monument in 1875. The newer monument also marks the burial place of Poe's wife, Virginia, and his mother-in-law, Maria. Theories as to what caused Poe's death include suicide, murder, cholera, hypoglycemia, rabies, syphilis, influenza, and that Poe was a victim of cooping. Evidence of the influence of alcohol is strongly disputed.|$|E
5|$|The first {{significant}} insight into Sorabji's life <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> correspondence with Peter Warlock, {{which began in}} 1913. At least {{partly as a result}} of Warlock's influence, Sorabji began to focus on composition and music criticism. In those letters he showed great interest in interacting with the world of musicians—an attitude that changed dramatically in later years. The {{first significant}} instance of such interaction took place in November 1919. Sorabji had sent several of his scores, including that of his First Piano Sonata, to Ernest Newman, who paid them no attention. Sorabji then played the piece to Ferruccio Busoni, who expressed some reservations about the work, but gave him a letter of recommendation, which helped Sorabji get it published.|$|E
5|$|Most of what {{is known}} about Blois' episcopate <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> acta, or records; 86 of them survive. There is an early 14th-century {{reference}} to Blois' matricula, which can mean register, list, or list of students, but given the distance in time from when it was recorded to Blois' episcopate, it is unclear what exactly was meant by this. Nor has any such document survived. Blois' acta show him to have been an active and diligent administrator, especially concerned with the establishment of vicarages and with parish care. He also spent time mediating disputes, including one in 1204 over a church at Eynesbury that was disputed between Saer de Quincy, the canons of Newnham Priory and monks of St Neot's Priory. Most of his clerks and household members appear to have been non-relatives, with only another William de Blois, appointed Archdeacon of Buckingham by the bishop before becoming Bishop of Worcester in 1218, being a relative.|$|E

5|$|Non-disabled sprinters have {{calves and}} ankles that return and amplify the energy {{supplied}} by their hips and knees, while Pistorius compensates with additional work {{because he does}} not have calves and ankles with their associated tendons and muscles. An analysis published by Engineering & Technology magazine estimates that in using the blades, Pistorius must generate twice the power from his gluteal and quadriceps muscles that a normal sprinter would. Other sources also credit core abdominal muscles and a faster arm swing. His trainer estimates that about 85 percent of his power <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> hips and the rest from his knees. This results in a gait that waddles slightly, as Pistorius swings his upper body to balance the springing action of the blades. The blades compress under his weight, then release as he moves forward, providing forward thrust from the tips as they return to their molded shape. As they spring off, he swings them slightly out to the side and throws them forward for the next stride.|$|E
5|$|Yao {{is one of}} China's most {{recognizable}} athletes, along with Liu Xiang. As of 2009, he had led Forbes' Chinese celebrities list in income and popularity for six straight years, earning US$51million (CN¥357million) in 2008. A major part of his income <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> sponsorship deals, as he is under contract with several major companies to endorse their products. He was signed by Nike {{until the end of}} his rookie season. When Nike decided not to renew his contract, he signed with Reebok. He also had a deal with Pepsi, and he successfully sued Coca-Cola in 2003 when they used his image on their bottles while promoting the national team. He eventually signed with Coca-Cola for the 2008 Olympics. His other deals include partnerships with Visa, Apple, Garmin, and McDonald's.|$|E

25|$|An Essay on the Writings and Genius of Shakespeare defends Shakespeare against {{criticism}} by {{supporters of the}} French style of drama, particularly against the attacks of Voltaire.

25|$|In {{spite of}} his stature as a historian, modern historians know {{relatively}} little about Thucydides's life.

Thucydides informs us that he fought in the war, contracted the plague and was exiled by the democracy. He may have also been involved in quelling the Samian Revolt.|$|E

25|$|Much of what {{is known}} about Lord Chunshen <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> {{biography}} in the Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji), written by the great Han Dynasty historian Sima Qian. The Shiji does not mention his family background, leading some historians to speculate that he descended from the State of Huang, judging by his surname. However, most modern historians, including Ch'ien Mu and Yang Kuan, believe that he was a son of King Huai of Chu, and younger brother of King Qingxiang of Chu.|$|E
25|$|Most {{evidence}} for Leland's {{life and career}} <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> own writings, especially his poetry.

Having lost both his parents at an early age, {{he and his brother}} were raised by Thomas Myles. Leland was educated at St Paul's School, London, under its first headmaster, William Lily. It was here that he already met some of his future benefactors, notably William Paget.|$|E
