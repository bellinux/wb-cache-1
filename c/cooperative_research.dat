These technologies include magnetic alignment of nanotubes, fabrication of nanotube membranes or buckypapers, production of nanotube composites, modeling of nanotube-epoxy interaction at the molecular level, and characterization of SWNT nanocomposites for mechanical properties, electrical conductivity, thermal management, radiation shielding and EMI attenuation. HPMI personnel also established Florida's first National Science Foundation (NSF) Industry/University <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Research</b> Center (IUCRC).|$|E

25|$|Lasers {{have been}} used with success to {{disperse}} several species of birds. However, lasers are species specific as certain species will only react to certain wavelengths. Lasers become more effective as ambient light levels decrease, thereby limiting effectiveness during daylight hours. Some species show {{a very short time}} to habituation (Airport <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Research</b> Program, 2011). The risks of lasers to aircrews must be evaluated when determining whether or not to deploy lasers on airfields (Federal Aviation Administration 2012). Southampton Airport utilises a laser device which disables the laser past a certain elevation, eliminating the risk of the beam being shone directly at aircraft and air traffic control tower (Southampton Airport 2014).|$|E
25|$|In {{groundbreaking}} research, Paul K. Boss and Mark R. Thomas of the CSIRO Plant Industry and <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Research</b> Centre for Viticulture in Glen Osmond, Australia, {{found that}} Pinot Meunier has a mutation (VvGAI1) that stops it from responding to gibberellic acid, a plant growth hormone. This leads to different, white-haired, leaf and shoot growth, {{and also to}} a slight stunting in growth, explaining why Pinot Meunier plants {{tend to be a}} bit smaller than Pinot noir. The mutation exist only in the outermost cell layer of the cultivar, the L1 or 'epidermal' layer, meaning Pinot Meunier is a chimera. Through tissue culture, it is thus possible to separate out plants containing both the mutant (L1) and non-mutant (L2) genotypes, yielding a normal Pinot noir -like genotype and an unusual looking L1-genotype vine with compressed internodes and thickly clustered leaves. The mutants could not produce full-grown tendrils, it seems that gibberellic acid converts grapevine flower buds into tendrils.|$|E

25|$|Historically, several {{buildings}} {{were built in}} conjunction with the Metromover and Metrorail systems in the 1980s. Both systems connect {{on the north side of}} Stephen P. Clark Government Center. The Knight Center Metromover station is built into the Miami Tower (formerly Bank of America Building); it is connected via pedestrian tunnel to the James L Knight Center under Downtown Distributor overpasses. Another private development, the ambitious Omni International Mall, colloquially known as the Omni, is connected to the Adrienne Arsht Center station (formerly Omni station), by a pedestrian bridge that was closed when the majority of the mall closed. Outside of the downtown area, the highly dense suburb of unincorporated Kendall in South Dade has been built up significantly around the busy Metrorail stations of Dadeland North and Dadeland South, both of which opened in 1984, in an area known as Dadeland. This area is an officially recognized transit-oriented development by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA)-sponsored Transit <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Research</b> Program (TCRP). Both stations consistently have over 6,000 weekday passengers as of the mid 2010s, and they form the southern terminus of the current Metrorail line.|$|E

500|$|In May 2012, the Army's Project Manager for Maneuver Ammunition System (PM MAS) {{began to}} {{emphasize}} the need for munitions suppliers to begin readying for GCV IFV ammunition needs. [...] Solutions ranged from 25mm to 50mm, but 30x173mm was identified as [...] "the most likely" [...] design to meet lethality and stowed kill requirements. [...] Specific requirements were for airburst capability to defeat infantry targets (with high explosive incendiary recognized as a [...] "less effective alternative"), armor-piercing rounds to defeat material threats, and training ammunition for each tactical round. [...] Potential candidates included five U.S. produced and three foreign-made rounds. [...] On 7 August 2013, a sources sought announcement was made for a <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Research</b> and Development Agreement for 30x173 mm ammunition: 2,700 rounds of Mk 238 Mod 1 High Explosive Incendiary-Tracer (HEI-T); 2,000 rounds of Mk 258 Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot-Tracer (APFSDS-T); 2,000 rounds of Mk 268 Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot-Tracer (APFSDS-T); and 2,000 rounds of Mk 317 Target Practice Discarding Sabot-Tracer (TPDS-T). [...] The announcement called for the cartridges to be compatible with the Bushmaster III weapon system, such as XM813 and/or Mk 44 Mod 1. [...] All interested participants had to provide the ammo quantities and associated information {{before the end of}} March 2015.|$|E
