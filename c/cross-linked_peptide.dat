Chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry has proven to be a powerful method not only for mapping protein-protein interactions of all natures, including weak and transient ones, but also for determining their interaction interfaces. One critical challenge remaining in this approach is how to effectively isolate and identify cross-linked products from a complex peptide mixture. In this work, we have developed a novel strategy using conjugation chemistry for selective enrichment of cross-linked products. An azide-tagged cross-linker along with two biotinylated conjugation reagents were designed and synthesized. Cross-linking of model peptides and cytochrome c as well as enrichment of the resulting <b>cross-linked</b> <b>peptides</b> has been assessed. Selective conjugation of azide-tagged <b>cross-linked</b> <b>peptides</b> has been demonstrated using two strategies: copper catalyzed cycloaddition and Staudinger ligation.

The association of plasma serotonin with markers of bone formation and bone resorption in hemodialysis patients was evaluated. Materials and Methods. Twenty-four hemodialysis patients (11 diabetics) and 22 healthy volunteers were enrolled into the study. Serotonin was assessed in platelet-free plasma, whereas the markers of osteoblastic activity N-terminal midfragment osteocalcin and total procollagen type- 1 aminoterminal propeptide {{as well as the}} marker of osteoclastic activity β-isomerized C-terminal <b>cross-linked</b> <b>peptide</b> of collagen type I were measured in serum. Serum intact parathyroid hormone was also assessed. Results. Serotonin did not significantly differ between hemodialysis patients and healthy volunteers. All evaluated markers of bone metabolism and intact parathyroid hormone were much higher in hemodialysis patients. Serotonin was significantly correlated with all evaluated markers of bone metabolism in hemodialysis patients. Serotonin was reversely related to the patients' age. Serotonin, osteocalcin, procollagen type- 1 aminoterminal propeptide, and β-isomerized C-terminal <b>cross-linked</b> <b>peptide</b> of collagen type I were much lower in diabetic hemodialysis patients. Conclusions. Serotonin may increase both bone formation and bone resorption in hemodialysis patients. The reverse relation of serotonin to patients' age as well as its lower levels in diabetic hemodialysis patients indicate that low plasma serotonin may contribute to the higher incidence of low-turnover bone disease that characterizes old and diabetic hemodialysis patients. </p...|$|E

Analyses of 3 H radioactivity in disc electrophoretic profiles of the CNBr peptides from bone collagens that had been treated with NaB 3 H indicated that a major site of intermolecular cross-linking in chicken bone collagen is located between the carboxy-terminal region of an α 1 chain and a small CNBr peptide, probably situated near the amino-terminus of an α 1 or α 2 chain in an adjacent collagen molecule. A small amount of this cross-linked CNBr peptide was isolated from a CNBr digest of chicken bone collagen by column chromatography. Amino acid analysis showed that the CNBr peptide, α 1 CB 6 B, the carboxy-terminal peptide of the α 1 chain, was the major CNBr peptide in the preparation, and the reduced cross-linking components were identified as hydroxylysinohydroxynorleucine (HylOHNle), with a smaller amount of hydroxylysinonorleucine (HylNle). However, the composition and the low recovery of the cross-linking amino acids suggested that the preparation {{was a mixture of}} CNBr peptides α 1 CB 6 B and α 1 CB 6 B cross-linked to a small CNBr peptide whose identity could not be determined.

A peptide which had the same amino acid composition, but contained the cross-linking compounds in their reducible forms, was isolated from a collagenase digest of chicken bone collagen that had not been treated with NaBH 4. The absence of the reduced cross-links from this peptide indicates that, at least for the cross-linking site from which the peptide derives, natural reduction is not a significant pathway for biosynthesis of stable cross-links.

These changes are likely {{to be related to the}} movement of the conserved cell wall segments within the cell surface during cell division...|$|E
40|$|Sheep were immunized by {{multiple}} injections of acid-extracted rat tail tendon tropocollagen. Antibody activity could be demonstrated by quantitative precipitation and passive haemagglutination against denatured tropocollagen. Immunodiffusion experiments showed strong precipitin lines with denatured tendon tropocollagen, and with peptides obtained by CNBr digestion of whole rat tail tendon. Immunoelectrophoresis showed one line with denatured tropocollagen but four lines with the CNBr digest of whole tendon indicating {{at least four}} antigenic determinants. Immunosorbents prepared from antisera raised against tropocollagen readily absorbed labelled peptides from CNBr digests of rat tail tendons reduced with tritiated borohydride. These peptides were recoverable by desorption with 1 M ammonia and had a hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine content typical of collagen but increased tyrosine levels. Presence of the normal reducible components of collagen known {{to be involved in}} cross-linking was confirmed by ion-exchange chromatography, and there was an increase in the proportion of fraction C. The majority of the tritium label was found in a <b>cross-linked</b> <b>peptide,</b> or group of peptides, with molecular weight around 60, 000. The technique therefore has the potential for further development in the isolation of specific collagen peptides...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{cross-linking}} {{combined with}} mass spectrometry (MS) {{has been used}} to elucidate protein structures and protein-protein interactions. However, heterogeneity of the samples and the relatively low abundance of <b>cross-linked</b> <b>peptides</b> make this approach challenging. As an effort to overcome this hurdle, we have synthesized lysine-reactive homobifunctional cross-linkers with the biotin {{in the middle of the}} linker and used them to enrich <b>cross-linked</b> <b>peptides.</b> The reaction of biotin-tagged cross-linkers with purified HIV- 1 CA resulted in the formation of hanging and intramolecular crosslinks. The peptides modified with biotinylated cross-linkers were effectively enriched and recovered using a streptavidin-coated plate and MS-friendly buffers. The enrichment of modified peptides and removal of the dominantly unmodified peptides simplify mass spectra and their analyses. The combination of the high mass accuracy of Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) MSand the tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) capability of the linear ion trap allows us to unambiguously identify the cross-linking sites and additional modification, such as oxidation. close 232...|$|R
40|$|Chemical cross-linking, {{together}} with mass spectrometry (MS), {{is a powerful}} combination for probing subunit interactions within static protein assemblies. To probe conformational changes in response to stimuli, we have developed a comparative cross-linking strategy, using lysine-specific deuterated and nondeuterated bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate cross-linking reagents (BS 3). Here we describe the experimental procedures {{as well as the}} data analysis, validation and interpretation. The protocol involves first assigning <b>cross-linked</b> <b>peptides</b> in the complex without ligand binding, or with post-translational modifications (PTMs) at natural abundance, using a standard procedure with labeled cross-linkers, proteolysis and assignment of <b>cross-linked</b> <b>peptides</b> after liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) and database searching. An aliquot of the protein complex is then exposed to a stimulus: either ligand binding or incubation with a phosphatase or kinase to bring about changes in PTMs. Two solutions [...] one containing the apo/untreated complex and the other containing the enzymatically modified/ligand-bound complex [...] are then cross-linked independently. Typically, nondeuterated BS 3 -d 0 is used for the untreated complex and deuterated BS 3 -d 4 is used for the experiment. The two aliquots are then incubated at equal concentrations, digested and processed as before. The ratios of labeled and unlabeled <b>cross-linked</b> <b>peptides</b> provide a direct readout of the effect of the stimulus. We exemplify our method by quantifying changes in subunit interactions induced by dephosphorylation of an ATP synthase. The protocol {{can also be used to}} determine the conformational changes in protein complexes induced by various stimuli including ligand/drug binding, oligomerization and other PTMs. Application of the established protocol takes ~ 9 d, including protein complex purification...|$|R
40|$|In the cell, most {{proteins}} {{carry out}} their functions as subunits of larger assemblies. Knowledge about the folding and mutual interactions of composing subunits is crucial to comprehend the dynamics and structures of such protein complexes and the molecular mechanisms underlying biological processes. Unfortunately, large complexes are often not amenable to techniques used to obtain detailed protein structural information like x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In this thesis chemical protein cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometric analysis (CXMS) has been utilized as a core approach to obtain structural information of proteins. With CXMS the identity of cross-linked amino acids and {{their position in the}} protein amino acid sequence is determined, yielding spatial distance restraints, since the linked residues cannot be father away in a cross-linked protein complex than the length of the spacer of the used crosslinker. With this information a topological map of subunit arrangements can be obtained. Although CXMS has been applied for more than a decade, the rareness and low abundance of <b>cross-linked</b> <b>peptides</b> in digests forms a main analytical challenge, since this circumstance hampers mass spectrometric analysis. In this thesis methodologies aimed at enrichment of <b>cross-linked</b> <b>peptides</b> have been developed and applied. These studies were performed both in isolated complexes and in complicated protein mixtures. In Chapter 2, 3 and 4, the development of enrichment approaches intended to isolate azide-containing <b>cross-linked</b> <b>peptides</b> of proteins/complexes for mass spectrometric analysis are described. In Chapter 5, the characterization of novel interaction using the methodology developed in this thesis is shown...|$|R
