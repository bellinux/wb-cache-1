5|$|The RNAi pathway {{is found}} in many eukaryotes, {{including}} animals, and is initiated by the enzyme Dicer, which cleaves long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules into short double-stranded fragments of ~20 nucleotide siRNAs. Each siRNA is unwound into two single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs), the passenger strand and the guide strand. The passenger strand is degraded and the guide strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The most well-studied outcome is post-transcriptional gene silencing, which occurs when the guide strand pairs with a <b>complementary</b> <b>sequence</b> in a messenger RNA molecule and induces cleavage by Argonaute 2 (Ago2), the catalytic component of the RISC complex. In some organisms, this process spreads systemically, despite the initially limited molar concentrations of siRNA.|$|E
25|$|Intentional {{degradation}} of mRNA is used {{not just as}} a defence mechanism from foreign RNA (normally from viruses) but also as a route of mRNA destabilisation. If an mRNA molecule has a <b>complementary</b> <b>sequence</b> to a small interfering RNA then it is targeted for destruction via the RNA interference pathway.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{detailed}} {{comparison of}} the MS data with predictions based on the known protein sequence {{may be used to}} define post-translational modifications, targeted approaches to data acquisition may also be used. For instance, specific enrichment of phosphopeptides may assist in identifying phosphorylation sites in a protein. Alternative methods of peptide fragmentation in the mass spectrometer, such as ETD or ECD, may give <b>complementary</b> <b>sequence</b> information.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Multiple-shift <b>complementary</b> <b>sequences</b> (MCS), a {{generalized}} form of Golay <b>complementary</b> <b>sequences,</b> have re-cently {{been introduced to}} encode OFDM signals, allowing a better trade-off between the code rate and peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR). However, a table of such sequences needs to be constructed by exhaustive search, a practically impossible task for a moderately large number of sub-carriers. As has been done for Golay <b>complementary</b> <b>sequences</b> and generalized Golay <b>complementary</b> <b>sequences,</b> this paper successfully identifies a class of MCS as the second order cosets of the first order Reed-Muller codes. We also present a new proof for the PMEPR of MCS. I...|$|R

25|$|Nucleotide {{excision}} repair is a DNA repair mechanism. There are three {{excision repair}} pathways: nucleotide excision repair (NER), base excision repair (BER), and DNA mismatch repair (MMR). In NER, the damaged DNA strand is removed and the undamaged strand is kept as {{a template for}} the formation of a <b>complementary</b> <b>sequence</b> with DNA polymerase. DNA ligase joins the strands together to form dsDNA. There are two subpathways for NER, which differ only in their mechanism for recognition: global genomic NER (GG-NER) and transcription coupled NER (TC-NER).|$|E
25|$|The {{integration}} of phage λ {{takes place at}} a special attachment site in the bacterial and phage genomes, called attλ. The sequence of the bacterial att site is called attB, between the gal and bio operons, and consists of the parts B-O-B', whereas the <b>complementary</b> <b>sequence</b> in the circular phage genome is called attP and consists of the parts P-O-P'. The integration itself is a sequential exchange (see genetic recombination) via a Holliday junction and requires both the phage protein Int and the bacterial protein IHF (integration host factor). Both Int and IHF bind to attP and form an intasome, a DNA-protein-complex designed for site-specific recombination of the phage and host DNA. The original B-O-B' sequence is changed by the integration to B-O-P'-phage DNA-P-O-B'. The phage DNA {{is now part of}} the host's genome.|$|E
25|$|The siRNA induced post {{transcriptional}} {{gene silencing}} starts with the assembly of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The complex silences certain gene expression by cleaving the mRNA molecules coding the target genes. To begin the process, {{one of the two}} siRNA strands, the guide strand, will be loaded into the RISC while the other strand, the passenger strand, is degraded. Certain Dicer enzymes may be responsible of loading the guide strand into RISC. Then, the siRNA scans for and direct RISC to perfectly <b>complementary</b> <b>sequence</b> on the mRNA molecules. The cleavage of the mRNA molecules is thought to be catalyzed by the Piwi domain of Argonaute proteins of the RISC. The mRNA molecule is then cut precisely by cleaving the phosphodiester bond between the target nucleotides which are paired to siRNA residues 10 and 11, counting from the 5’end. This cleavage results in mRNA fragments that are further degraded by cellular exonucleases. The 5’ fragment is degraded from its 3’ end by exosome while the 3’ fragment is degraded from its 5’ end by 5' -3' exoribonuclease 1(XRN1). Dissociation of the target mRNA strand from RISC after the cleavage allow more mRNA to be silenced. This dissociation process is likely to be promoted by extrinsic factors driven by ATP hydrolysis.|$|E

One of the main targets of mir-126 is the host gene EGFL7.

30|$|Since {{correlation}} {{functions of}} <b>complementary</b> <b>sequences</b> {{are based on}} a flock of element sequences jointly instead of a single sequence, these element sequences should be transmitted via different channels which are usually different carriers like the cases in [3, 4, 16]. Therefore, <b>complementary</b> <b>sequences,</b> such as IGC sequences and Z-complementary sequences, are more sensitive to frequency selective fading channel than mutually orthogonal ZCZ sequence sets which are unitary sequence sets.

2500|$|Multiple {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} concerning transgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly. [...] This organism has been a helpful genetic model for over 100 years, due to its well-understood developmental pattern. [...] The transfer of transgenes into the Drosophila genome has been performed using various techniques, including P element, Cre-loxP, and ΦC31 insertion. [...] The most practiced method used thus far to insert transgenes into the Drosophila genome utilizes P elements. The transposable P elements, also known as transposons, are segments of bacterial DNA that are translocated into the genome, without the presence of a <b>complementary</b> <b>sequence</b> in the host’s genome. [...] P elements are administered in pairs of two, which flank the DNA insertion region of interest. [...] Additionally, P elements often consist of two plasmid components, one known as the P element transposase and the other, the P transposon backbone. [...] The transposase plasmid portion drives the transposition of the P transposon backbone, containing the transgene of interest and often a marker, between the two terminal sites of the transposon. Success of this insertion results in the nonreversible addition of the transgene of interest into the genome. While this method has been proven effective, the insertion sites of the P elements are often uncontrollable, resulting in an unfavorable, random insertion of the transgene into the Drosophila genome.|$|E

Certain classes of these <b>complementary</b> <b>sequences</b> {{have been identified as}} a subset of second order cosets of the first order Reed-Muller codes. Since the code rates of these encoding schemes are prohibitively low for a large number of sub-carriers, it is necessary to find an efficient algebraic way to produce sufficient number of codewords such that the code rate of the encoding scheme is high enough. In this paper, we introduce generalized Rudin-Shapiro polynomials, a subset generalized Golay <b>complementary</b> <b>sequences,</b> to encode OFDM signals. In our encoding scheme, a matrix equation recursively produces a sufficient number of Rudin-Shapiro polynomials such that the code rate increases linearly with respect to the PMEPR.
