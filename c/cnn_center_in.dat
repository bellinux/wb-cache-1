50|$|Unable {{to resolve}} the arena situation, Kerner sold the Hawks to Atlanta real estate {{developer}} Tom Cousins and former Georgia governor Carl Sanders, who moved the team to Atlanta in 1968. While a new arena was being constructed, the team spent its first four seasons playing at Alexander Memorial Coliseum {{on the campus of}} Georgia Tech, winning their first Division title in the 1969-70 season with a 48-34 record in the Western Division. Cousins' firm soon developed the Omni Coliseum, a 16,500-seat, state-of-the-art downtown Atlanta arena, for the Hawks and the expansion Atlanta Flames hockey franchise, which opened in 1972 as the first phase of a massive sports, office, hotel and retail complex, most of which is now the <b>CNN</b> <b>Center.</b> Also <b>in</b> 1972, the Hawks debuted a new logo and new colors, trading the green and blue color scheme that the team had used for two years, in favor of white, gold, and red, the same colors the Flames used. The hawk head silhouette inside a circle remained as the team's logo, albeit simplified.|$|R
5000|$|The channel 17 {{transmitter}} {{was originally}} located at 1018 West Peachtree Street Northwest (it {{has since been}} relocated to the Atlanta suburb of North Druid Hills, Georgia), with the antenna located on a large self-supporting tower. The building at this site was once home to the studios of CBS affiliate WAGA-TV (now a Fox owned-and-operated station) and, later, channel 17, during its first three years as WJRJ-TV. Soon after being purchased by Turner, the station moved to new studio facilities a few blocks west at the former site of the Progressive Club, after briefly having had offices on Williams Street, across Interstate 75/85; these facilities now house Adult Swim and Williams Street Productions. It shared the ex-Progressive Club studios with CNN and Headline News until they moved into the <b>CNN</b> <b>Center</b> downtown <b>in</b> 1987. Initially, WTCG was identified as [...] "Channel 17" [...] both locally in Atlanta and on cable providers outside of that area. The same shows that ran on the local Atlanta broadcast were also aired nationally. After the station adopted WTBS as its callsign, Turner branded the station as [...] "Superstation WTBS" [...] with reference within the logo to the channel 17 frequency in Atlanta. Many cable providers throughout the country even carried it on channel 17.|$|R

50|$|The <b>CNN</b> <b>Center</b> opened <b>in</b> 1976 as the Omni Complex, {{which was}} a {{development}} by Cousins Properties. The Omni Coliseum, an NBA and NHL arena directly connected to the Omni Complex, opened 3 years earlier, on October 14, 1972. The Omni Complex largely sat vacant until CNN moved its headquarters there in 1987 from its Midtown Atlanta site (old home of the Progressive Club on 1050 Techwood Drive and home to Turner Broadcasting System). The facility originally offered office space to various business tenants, as well as consulates over the years. The main floor featured an indoor ice skating rink, {{as well as a}} small number of restaurants and a Gold Mine video arcade. More famously, Sid and Marty Krofft built an indoor amusement park called The World of Sid and Marty Krofft, inspired by the creations of the popular children's television producers. The park was the first indoor theme park and opened in 1976, but closed within six months. The complex also featured a multi-screen movie theater. For years, the theater offered showings of Gone with the Wind, Ted Turner's favorite movie. The theater was replaced during renovations to put in a new newsroom for CNN's website operations. The ice skating rink was filled in and a mosaic map of the world replaced it (featuring brass markers indicating the locations of CNN bureaux around the world). Prior to moving, CNN and Headline News were based in a former country club on Techwood Drive in Midtown Atlanta, sharing the facility with WTBS, which currently serves as the campus for nearly all other Turner networks and Turner Studios; the mansion facade also served as the logo for Turner's theatrical and home video arms during the 1990s. When CNN networks moved to the <b>CNN</b> <b>Center</b> on July 13, 1987, CNN Headline News (now known as HLN) was the first network to broadcast a show from it at 3.00 ET with its program # 96,915. Their sister channel started live programming at 6.00 p.m. ET of that day.|$|R
