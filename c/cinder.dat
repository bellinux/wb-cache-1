5|$|The steep conical <b>cinder</b> cones of Edziza {{were formed}} by lava {{fountain}} eruptions, emitting particles and blobs of congealed lava {{from a single}} vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as <b>cinder</b> around the vent to form a circular or oval cone. Edziza's <b>cinder</b> cones have bowl-shaped craters at their summits and rise {{more than a hundred}} metres above their surroundings. <b>Cinder</b> cones are widespread in British Columbia as well as throughout other volcanic terrains of the world.|$|E
5|$|The shaded north {{slopes of}} <b>cinder</b> cones provide more {{protection}} from direct sunlight and prevailing southwesterly winds {{and have a}} more persistent snow cover (an important water source in early spring). These parts of <b>cinder</b> cones are therefore colonized by plants first.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism in the Spanish Creek and Ray Lake {{areas were}} synglacial but {{continued}} after the glacial ice had melted away. Two <b>cinder</b> cones, known as Flourmill Cone and Pointed Stick Cone, {{were created in}} the Spanish Creek area. Lava flows from the two <b>cinder</b> cones lie on glaciated bedrock without an intervening paleosol, indicating an early Holocene age.|$|E

5|$|If magma were to rise {{towards the}} surface of Nazko, new {{earthquake}} swarms would occur, with {{a significant increase in}} the size and number of earthquakes. An eruption in the Nazko area would probably create a small <b>cinder</b> cone, similar to what formed Nazko Cone 7,200years ago. Immediate hazards related to <b>cinder</b> cone eruptions in the Nazko area would probably be forest fires and, if an eruption column were produced, redirection of nearby air traffic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{craft of}} sodium {{hydroxide}} roasting-aqueous leaching process is investigated {{for the treatment}} of a high arsenic pyrite <b>cinders,</b> a common by-product in vitriol industry. The pyrite <b>cinders,</b> containing 58. 27 % Fe, and 0. 98 % As, was conducted for the craft. The results demonstrated that iron concentrate with 58. 87 % Fe, 0. 13 % As and 87. 40 % of arsenic removal percentage was obtained under the optimal conditions (a roasting temperature of 1000 °C, a roasting duration of 120 min and a mass ratio of sodium hydroxide to pyrite <b>cinders</b> of 8 %). This craft can be used to utilize pyrite <b>cinders</b> and produce qualified concentrate as iron-bearing feed for steel industry, which will help to solve the pollution of pyrite <b>cinders</b> and extend raw material sourcing for Chinese steel industry...|$|R

5|$|Strombolian eruptions eject {{volcanic}} {{bombs and}} lapilli fragments that travel in parabolic paths before landing around their source vent.

5|$|The latest {{volcanic}} eruption created a small tree-covered basaltic <b>cinder</b> cone {{at the east}} end of Kostal Lake called Kostal Cone perhaps as recently as 400 years ago, {{making it one of the}} youngest volcanoes in Canada based on tree-growth data.|$|E
5|$|In {{the northwestern}} and northeastern {{parts of the}} shield volcano, basanite lava flows were erupted and are volumetrically subordinate. These {{represent}} the youngest known lavas of the Itcha Range. However, a <b>cinder</b> cone {{in the middle of}} the shield could be much younger, perhaps as young as the basanites at Nazko Cone to the east, which were erupted 340,000to 7,100years ago. The older basanites in the Itcha Range may have been erupted contemporaneously with the late feldspar hawaiites.|$|E
5|$|Magmatic eruptions have {{produced}} tephra, pyroclastic flows, and lava flows from summit vents and the Schriebers Meadow <b>cinder</b> cone. The most destructive and most frequent events at Mount Baker have been lahars or debris flows and debris avalanches; many, if not most, {{of these were}} not related to magmatic eruptions but may have been induced by magma intrusion, steam eruptions, earthquakes, gravitational instability, or possibly even heavy rainfall.|$|E

But they did not like to face facts, my dears, as very few people do; and so they invented a cock-and-bull story, which, I am sure, I never told them, that the smoke was the breath of a giant, whom some gods or other had buried under the mountain; and that the <b>cinders</b> were what the dwarfs roasted the little pigs whole with; and other nonsense of that kind. And, when folks are in that humour, I cannot teach them, save by the good old birch-rod." ...|$|R

5|$|Over {{the last}} 14.5million years, the Anahim hotspot has created at least 40volcanoes. They can be {{organized}} into three groupings: the eastern section, which comprises several small <b>cinder</b> cones {{and is the}} location of all modern volcanic activity; the central section, which consists of predominantly shield volcanoes; and the western section, {{all of which have}} since been reduced to remnants of eruptive breccia and high-level plutons and dike swarms. These form one of the six Neogene-Quaternary volcanic provinces in British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Parasitic cones of the Itcha Range shield {{were formed}} mainly during the Early Pleistocene mafic capping stage between 2.2and 0.8million years ago. These {{secondary}} vents are monogenetic in nature, meaning each cone was only active {{for a single}} eruption sequence before becoming extinct. The duration of volcanic activity at these cones can last from hours to years. Parasitic cones of the Itcha Range are small <b>cinder</b> cones situated at the summit and flanks of the shield volcano.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of these}} lava flows blocked rivers and streams, {{impounding}} small lakes and ephemeral ponds in the process. About 100,000years ago, basalt from the largest <b>cinder</b> cone in the park, Crater Hill, flowed over the area. The lava traveled into Coalpits and Scoggins Washes {{to the south}} and accumulated to a depth of over 400ft (122m) in the ancestral Virgin River valley near the present-day ghost town of Grafton, Utah. Water impounded behind the two blockages, forming Coalpits Lake and Lake Grafton respectively.|$|E

5|$|The 2007–2008 Nazko {{earthquakes}} were {{a series}} of small volcanic earthquakes measuring less than 4.0 on the Richter magnitude scale. They took place in the sparsely populated Nazko area of the Central Interior of British Columbia, Canada starting on October 9, 2007 and ending on June 12, 2008. They occurred just west of Nazko Cone, a small tree-covered <b>cinder</b> cone that last erupted about 7,200 years ago.|$|E
5|$|The Itcha Range {{is part of}} an east-west {{trending}} volcanic zone {{called the}} Anahim Volcanic Belt. This consists of large shield volcanoes, small <b>cinder</b> cones, lava domes and lava flows that become progressively younger from west to east. Several explanations have been made regarding the creation of this feature, each citing a different geologic process. If volcanic activity were to resume at the Itcha Range, Canada's Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan (IVENP) is prepared to notify people threatened by eruptions.|$|E
