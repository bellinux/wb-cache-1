If they give in to weakness, {{following}} the models of behavior that can rightly be considered a 'scandal in the contemporary world' (and these are, unfortunately, widely diffused models), {{in the depths of}} their hearts they still desire a beautiful and pure love. This is as true of boys as it is of girls. Ultimately, they know that only God <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> this love. As a result, they are willing to follow Christ, without caring about the sacrifices this may entail.|$|E

You've got to have enough narrative force {{to get people to}} finish the book, but if you <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> an exciting story, you can always make your points." [...] He stated that [...] "the whole point of the book is to raise awareness about the kiddie-sex tourism business in Thailand". Though the story uses more realism than the escapism typically associated with superhero fiction, Vachss did end the book with endorsements of two real non-profit groups; Don't! Buy! Thai! and End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism. The writing is not subtle, as Vachss noted [...] "If you don't get angry, you're not going to do anything". Understanding that the likely readers were young males with short attention spans, Vachss tried to be dramatic by using what author Adam Begley calls [...] "a motivational hat trick: sympathy for the victims, revenge, and a family calling".|$|E

500|$|When Stephen King {{created the}} {{character}} of Flagg, he based him around what he believed evil represented. To King, Flagg is [...] "somebody who’s very charismatic, laughs a lot, [...] tremendously attractive {{to men and women}} both, and [...] somebody who just appeals to the worst in all of us". This idea carries over into The Stand, in which Flagg first appears as the personification of evil opposing Mother Abagail, the personification of good. Character Tom Cullen ascribes to Flagg the ability to kill animals and inflict cancer at will, referring to him as the demon Legion, while character Glen Bateman refers to him as the Lovecraftian entity Nyarlathotep, among other ancient names. King wanted Flagg to embody a [...] "gigantic evil", although he intended the character to weaken by the end of The Stand. He said, [...] "I think the Devil is probably a pretty funny guy. Flagg is like the archetype of everything that I know about real evil, going back all the way to Charles Starkweather in the '50s—he is somebody who is empty and who has to be filled with other people's hates, fears, resentments, laughs. Flagg, Koresh, Jim Jones, Hitler—they're all basically the same guy". Although Flagg was not intended to represent Satan, this did not detract from what King sees as his ultimate goal. He notes that no matter who sees him or how he is seen as Flagg appears differently to different individuals, his message is the same: [...] "I know all the things that you want and I <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> to you and {{all you have to do}} is give me your soul".|$|E

To help illustrate [...] "what type of gift you want to give your future spouse" [...] one of the program's exercises includes fathers presenting their daughters with two [...] "purity rings". One ring symbolizing virginity is [...] "wrapped in white" [...] representing a [...] "pretty white package" [...] that [...] "they could give their spouses" [...] which is then contrasted by the father [...] "pulling another gift out of his pocket, which was tattered and torn". [...] Fathers are then told to explain that this torn and tattered package [...] "which still contained virginity, but it was “beat up, battered and had been around the block.” [...] Finally, Fathers can explain that [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> this pure, white gift, or you <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> the tattered one...that you can always be like the pure, white gift, but once you’re tattered, you can never go back to being like the pure gift.” ...|$|E

Indeed, which of the above eigenstates the system jumps to is given by a probabilistic law: the probability of the system jumping to the state is proportional to the absolute value of the corresponding numerical factor squared. These numerical factors are called probability amplitudes, and this relationship used to calculate probabilities from given pure quantum states (such as wave functions) is called the Born rule.|$|E

2500|$|The {{massacre}} of the 72 migrants, the mass graves with nearly 200 bodies, {{the assassination of}} the PRI candidate for state governor, Rodolfo Torre Cantú, the murder of two city mayors, the numerous prison breaks and killings, the escalating violence in Tamaulipas and the lack of media coverage, along with the political and police corruption, have brought analysts to conclude that Tamaulipas may in fact be (or become) a [...] "failed state." [...] According to Gary J. Hill, a drug war analyst and chief member of the DEA, the organized crime groups have [...] "gained ground over local governments," [...] and have gradually subverted the abilities of the politicians in Tamaulipas.

2500|$|NPC AI is {{determined}} {{primarily by the}} [...] "Fear/trust system". The trust system determines whether the NPCs will follow Blake's orders and join him in combat. To do so, the player must ensure the NPC trusts Blake, and does not suspect him of being a Thing. NPCs have four levels of trust; red, amber, green and 100%. Red means they are convinced Blake is a Thing and will attack him. Amber means they are {{not sure if he}} is a Thing, and although they won't attack him, they won't follow his orders. Green means they trust him and will follow his orders. 100% means they have complete faith in him, will follow his orders, and even if he attacks another NPC, they will support him. To gain the trust of NPCs, Blake <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> weapons and ammo, heal them, put himself at risk to protect them, or use a blood test kit on himself to prove he is not a Thing. Actions which deplete trust include accidentally shooting teammates, taking away teammate's weapons or ammo, or pointing a weapon at them for a sustained period of time to force them to do something.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1951 Dawson, as {{a cowboy}} entertainer, narrated a {{documentary}} film, directed by Rudall Hayward, on Australian rough riders at a Kyabram rodeo, {{which was to}} be broadcast on United States TV.

They're entitled to all the credit we <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> ... Rodeos and rough riders are just {{as much a part of}} our national heritage as symphonies and seascapes". In June that year Dawson and Dot travelled to the US where he recorded and played at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. While in New Jersey, he took the role of Petruchio in a stage version of the musical, Kiss Me, Kate. When Dawson returned to Australia in September 1952 he was hailed as an [...] "Australian singing 'cowboy' who has made good in the US at the expense of the world's best". For trick riding his palomino horse, Flash (1951–1982), was bedecked in American-style tack rather than Australian. Flash lived to be 31 years old and Dawson supplemented his feed by giving him porridge with a spoon. Echoing US singing cowboy, Roy Rogers, on 8 December 1952 Dawson starred in his own radio show, The Adventures of Smoky Dawson, which stayed on the air for ten years until 1962.|$|E
