50|$|The Ranger was an {{off-road}} Harley-Davidson motorcycle without lights, {{made only}} in 1962. It had an extra-low final-drive ratio of 7.0:1 (12-tooth <b>countershaft</b> <b>gear</b> and 84-tooth rear sprocket) with neither lighting system nor front fender. It {{is believed to}} have been built to consume their supply of 165 cc engines, which would not be needed for their other models.|$|E
50|$|In the 3 years {{leading up}} to 1913 William Brough had been {{developing}} a flat-twin engine in-line with the frame. It was very similar to the ABC engines of that period. This 497cc engine had overhead valves, 70mm bore and 64.5mm stroke, and had a magneto fitted above and a 2-speed gearbox below. By the end of 1914 it had replaced all other engines in the Brough range, and using it only 3-models were planned for 1915. The three models were the HS - which was fitted with a two-speed <b>countershaft</b> <b>gear</b> operated by dog clutches, with chain drive to the gearbox, and John Bull rubber belt drive to the rear wheel over an adjustable pulley allowing the top gear range to be varied. No clutch or kick-start was provided. The second model was the HB, which was fitted with a Sturmey-Archer 3-speed hub gearbox and handle starter. The third model was the HTT, which was very similar to the HS but fitted with a specially tuned engine with high-compression, lightweight steel pistons, different camshafts, and special front cylinder lubrication.|$|E

50|$|In some {{transmission}} designs (Volvo 850 and V/S70 series, for example) {{there are}} actually two countershafts, both driving an output pinion meshing with the front-wheel-drive transaxle's ring gear. This allows the transmission designer to make the transmission narrower, since each countershaft need only be half {{as long as a}} traditional <b>countershaft</b> with four <b>gears</b> and two shifters.|$|R
50|$|From 1913 the Duo was {{available}} {{with an extra}} chain driven <b>countershaft</b> with two <b>gears</b> and dog clutches before the drive went to the variable pulley arrangement, so that gear ratios extended from 4:1 to 16:1. The price went up with the change from 97 guineas to 106 guineas. In the Cyclecar Club's fuel economy competition the three Duos equipped with Lukin, Stewart-Precision and Solex carburettors recorded fuel consumptions of 40.3, 50.7 and 53.1 miles per gallon respectively.|$|R
50|$|The gear {{selector}} does not engage or disengage the actual gear teeth which are permanently meshed. Rather, {{the action of}} the {{gear selector}} is to lock one of the freely spinning gears to the shaft that runs through its hub. The shaft then spins together with that gear. The output shaft's speed relative to the countershaft is determined by the ratio of the two gears: the one permanently attached to the <b>countershaft,</b> and that <b>gear's</b> mate which is now locked to the output shaft.|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{behavior}} of a single-stage planetary gear set with helical gears of multishaft automotive automatic transmissions has been studied, in which one component of the planetary gear set is imposed by additional external vertical and axial loading from <b>countershaft</b> <b>gear</b> pair {{in addition to the}} moment. Under these combined loading conditions, the contributions of the deflections of the ring gear and the carrier cannot be neglected. A three-dimensional nonlinear time-variant dynamic model considering not only the transverse, torsional, axial, and rotational motions of the gears but also the elasticity of the mounted shafts has been developed by combining the lumped parameter method with finite element method. The natural modes and the forced vibration responses due to static transmission errors have been obtained. The proposed dynamic model is employed to describe the effects of the combined external loading condition and positioning on the dynamic {{behavior of}} a four-planet system...|$|E
50|$|Under one {{possible}} design, the transmission's input shaft has just one pinion gear, which drives the countershaft. Along the <b>countershaft</b> are mounted <b>gears</b> of various sizes, which rotate when the input shaft rotates. These gears {{correspond to the}} forward speeds and reverse. Each of the forward <b>gears</b> on the <b>countershaft</b> is permanently meshed with a corresponding gear on the output shaft. However, these driven gears are not rigidly attached to the output shaft: although the shaft runs through them, they spin independently of it, which is made possible by bearings in their hubs. Reverse is typically implemented differently; see the section on Reverse.|$|R
50|$|The car had an {{air-cooled}} 8 hp V-twin cylinder Chater-Lea engine {{driving the}} rear wheels through a two speed transmission with top gear being direct and the lower gear a chain reduction system. Reverse gear was obtained by diverting the drive through two friction wheels, one {{on the front of}} the propeller shaft and a larger one connected to the low <b>gear</b> <b>countershaft</b> in the transmission. The footbrake operated on {{the rear wheels}} with internal expanding shoes and the handbrake controlled a leather faced band contracting onto the main drive shaft. The final drive to the rear axle used a worm drive reduction system.|$|R

50|$|On a {{conventional}} rear-drive transmission, {{there are three}} basic shafts; the input, the output, and the countershaft. The input and output together are called the mainshaft, since they are joined inside the transmission so {{they appear to be}} a single shaft, although they rotate totally independently of each other. The input length of this shaft is much shorter than the output shaft. Parallel to the mainshaft is the countershaft. There are a number of gears fixed along the <b>countershaft,</b> and matching <b>gears</b> along the output shaft, although these are not fixed, and rotate independently of the output shaft. There are sliding dog collars, or dog clutches, between the gears on the output shaft, and to engage a gear to the shaft, the collar slides into the space between the shaft and the inside space of the gear, thus rotating the shaft as well. One collar is usually mounted between two gears, and slides both ways to engage one or the other gears, so on a four-speed there would be two collars. A front-drive transmission is basically the same, but may be simplified. There often are two shafts, the input and the output, but depending on the direction of rotation of the engine, three may be required. Rather than the input shaft driving the countershaft with a pinion gear, the input shaft takes over the countershaft's job, and the output shaft runs parallel to it. The gears are positioned and engaged just as they are on the countershaft and output shaft of a rear-drive. This merely eliminates one major component, the pinion gear. Part of the reason that the input and output are in-line on a rear drive unit is to relieve torsional stress on the transmission and mountings, but this isn't an issue in a front-drive as the gearbox is integrated into the transaxle.|$|R
