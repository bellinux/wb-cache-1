5|$|Modern {{reference}} books about aviation history represent the Coandă-1910 in various ways, if they mention the machine or the inventor at all. Some acknowledge Coandă as the discoverer of the Coandă effect but give Hans von Ohain the honour of designing the first jet engine to power an aircraft in manned flight, and Frank Whittle the honour of completing and patenting the first jet engine <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> flight. In their 1994 book American Aviation, authors Joe Christy and LeRoy Cook state that Coandă's 1910 aircraft {{was the first}} jet.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{received}} {{no information about}} the massacre until the summer of 1943, when Pooley, who {{had spent the last}} three years in a German hospital due to the injuries he had suffered in the massacre, was declared medically unfit and repatriated. British authorities did not believe Pooley's story on his arrival; it was not thought that the German army were <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> atrocities against British troops. Private O'Callaghan did not return to the United Kingdom until 1945 after the liberation of his prisoner-of-war camp. His confirmation of Pooley's story prompted an official investigation.|$|E

As Sarah predicted, the agents {{do not believe}} that Hank, an {{upstanding}} member of the community, would be <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> wrongdoing. Although he is ruled out as a suspect, Hank is told that the money was part of a ransom and that many of the bills' serial numbers were written down to track the cash. Hank realizes he cannot use the money without being caught; he goes home and burns it all. In a closing narration, Hank reflects on his losses; as he tries to move on with his life, the murderous events constantly haunt him.|$|E

5|$|Crime and Punishment {{focuses on}} the mental anguish and moral {{dilemmas}} of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in Saint Petersburg who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her cash. Raskolnikov, {{in an attempt to}} defend his actions, argues that with the pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime, while ridding the world of a vermin. He also commits the murder to test a theory of his that dictates some people are naturally <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> actions, and even have the right to perform them. Several times throughout the novel, Raskolnikov compares himself with Napoleon Bonaparte and shares his belief that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose.|$|E
5|$|Dawkins's meme {{refers to}} any {{cultural}} entity that an observer might consider a replicator {{of a certain}} idea or set of ideas. He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> replication, generally through communication and contact with humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of cultural evolution based on memes, a notion that {{is analogous to the}} theory of biological evolution based on genes.|$|E
5|$|Philip J. Currie of the University of Alberta has {{suggested}} that Tyrannosaurus may have been pack animals. Currie compared Tyrannosaurus rex favorably to related species Tarbosaurus bataar and Albertosaurus sarcophagus, fossil evidence from which Currie had previously used {{to suggest that they}} lived in packs. Currie pointed out that a find in South Dakota preserved three Tyrannosaurus rex skeletons in close proximity to each other. After using CT scanning, Currie stated that Tyrannosaurus would have been <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> complex behavior, because its brain size is three times greater than what would be expected for an animal of its size. Currie elaborated that Tyrannosaurus had a larger brain-to-body-size proportion than crocodiles and three times more than plant eating dinosaurs such as Triceratops of the same size. Currie believed Tyrannosaurus to be six times smarter than most dinosaurs and other reptiles. Because the available prey, such as Triceratops and Ankylosaurus, were well-armored, and that others were fast-moving, it would have been necessary for Tyrannosaurus to hunt in groups. Currie speculated that juveniles and adults would have hunted together, with the faster juveniles chasing down the prey and the more powerful adults making the kill, by analogy to modern-day pack hunters where each member contributes a skill.|$|E

The first Göktürk satellite is planned to be launched in 2013. The Turkish satellite is planned to be capable of taking satellite images of greater than two meters per pixel resolution, thus making Turkey the second nation in the world <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> a feat, after the United States.|$|E
25|$|Boole {{was born}} in Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England, the son of John Boole Sr (1779–1848), a {{shoemaker}} and Mary Ann Joyce. He had a primary school education, and received lessons from his father, but due to a serious decline in business, he had little further formal and academic teaching. William Brooke, a bookseller in Lincoln, may have helped him with Latin, which he may also have learned {{at the school of}} Thomas Bainbridge. He was self-taught in modern languages. In fact, when a local newspaper printed his translation of a Latin poem, a scholar accused him of plagiarism under the pretense that he was not <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> achievements. At age 16, Boole became the breadwinner for his parents and three younger siblings, taking up a junior teaching position in Doncaster at Heigham's School. He taught briefly in Liverpool.|$|E

25|$|Neurotoxic {{behavior}} of aluminum {{is known to}} occur upon entry into the circulatory system, where it can migrate to the brain and inhibit some of the crucial functions of the blood brain barrier (BBB). A loss of function in the BBB can produce significant damage to the neurons in the CNS, as the barrier protecting the brain from other toxins found in the blood {{will no longer be}} <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> action. Though the metal is known to be neurotoxic, effects are usually restricted to patients incapable of removing excess ions from the blood, such as those experiencing renal failure. Patients experiencing aluminum toxicity can exhibit symptoms such as impaired learning and reduced motor coordination. Additionally, systemic aluminum levels are known to increase with age, and have been shown to correlate with Alzheimer’s Disease, implicating it as a neurotoxic causative compound of the disease. Despite its known toxicity, aluminum is still extensively utilized in the packaging and preparing of food, while other toxic metals such as lead have been almost entirely phased-out of use in these industries.|$|E
500|$|Sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens's first {{association}} with the Mint was in 1891, when he served on a committee judging entries for the new silver coinage. [...] The Mint had offered only a small prize to the winner, and all invited artists (including St. Gaudens himself) refused to submit entries. The competition was open to the public, and the judging committee (which consisted of Saint-Gaudens, Mint Engraver Charles E. Barber, and commercial engraver Henry Mitchell) found no entry suitable. [...] This {{came as no surprise}} to Saint-Gaudens, who told Mint Director Edward O. Leech that there were only four men in the world <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> work, of whom three were in France and Saint-Gaudens was the fourth. [...] Barber, who had been Chief Engraver since 1879, felt that Saint-Gaudens overstated the case, and there was only one man <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> coinage work—Barber himself. [...] Leech responded to the failed competition by directing Barber to prepare new designs for the dime, quarter dollar, and half dollar, resulting in the Barber coinage, an issue which attracted considerable public dissatisfaction.|$|E
500|$|All Things Must Pass {{received}} {{almost universal}} critical acclaim on release – {{as much for}} the music and lyrical content as for the fact that, of all the former Beatles, it was the work of supposed junior partner George Harrison. Beatles author Robert Rodriguez has written of critics' attention being centred on [...] "a major talent unleashed, one who'd been hidden in plain sight all those years" [...] behind Lennon and McCartney. [...] "That the Quiet Beatle was <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> range," [...] Rodriguez continues, [...] "from the joyful 'What Is Life' to the meditative 'Isn't It a Pity' to the steamrolling 'Art of Dying' to the playful 'I Dig Love' – was revelatory." [...] Most reviewers tended to discount the third disc of studio jams, accepting that it was a [...] "free" [...] addition to justify the set's high retail price, although Anthony DeCurtis recognises Apple Jam as further evidence of the album's [...] "bracing air of creative liberation".|$|E

500|$|The year 2012 saw Cooper star in four films—The Words, Hit and Run, The Place Beyond the Pines, and Silver Linings Playbook. The mystery drama The Words failed commercially, as did {{the action}} comedy Hit and Run. In Derek Cianfrance's {{critically}} acclaimed crime drama The Place Beyond the Pines, Cooper played a rookie police officer, a role Cianfrance specifically wrote for him. The director drove five hours to Montreal to meet with Cooper to convince him {{to take on the}} role. Cianfrance described Cooper's character as someone [...] "paraded as a hero... But inside him corruption is going on, conflict is raging inside, guilt and shame are buried." [...] A writer from The Independent credited Cooper for [...] "excelling as an archetype, the principled man who is personally rather dislikeable", adding, [...] "I never imagined this actor <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> layered character work." [...] Despite positive reviews, the film had moderate box office returns.|$|E
500|$|When a {{group of}} French musicians led by Saint-Saëns tried to organise a boycott of German music during the First World War, Fauré and Messager dissociated {{themselves}} from the idea, though the disagreement did not affect their friendship with their old teacher. They were privately concerned that their friend {{was in danger of}} looking foolish with his excess of patriotism, and also his growing tendency to denounce in public the works of rising young composers, as in his condemnation of Debussy's En blanc et noir (1915): [...] "We must at all costs bar the door of the Institut against a man <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> atrocities; they should be put next to the cubist pictures." [...] His determination to block Debussy's candidacy for election to the Institut was successful, and caused bitter resentment from the younger composer's supporters. Saint-Saëns's response to the neoclassicism of Les Six was equally uncompromising: of Darius Milhaud's polytonal symphonic suite Protée (1919) he commented, [...] "fortunately, there are still lunatic asylums in France".|$|E

I had not known I was <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> rage ... I felt God had played a horrible trick on me." [...] To be at home every day for his young sons, Biden began the practice of commuting every day by Amtrak train for 1½ hours each way from his home in the Wilmington suburbs to Washington, D.C., which he continued to do throughout his Senate career. [...] In the aftermath of the accident, he had trouble focusing on work, and appeared to just go through the motions of being a senator. In his memoirs, Biden notes that staffers were taking bets on how long he would last. [...] A single father for five years, he left standing orders that he be interrupted in the Senate at any time if his sons called. [...] In remembrance of his wife and daughter, Biden does not work on December 18, the anniversary of the accident.|$|E

She had a bit of dried blood on her lip. She had no hair." [...] Hill also said he had heard them talking about [...] "dentistry work. It was something about pulling her teeth out with a pair of pliers." [...] Later, he was left alone in the house with Capper, who pleaded with him to untie her. He said: [...] "She asked me if I could help but I told her I couldn't. I asked her who she was. She said her name was Suzanne. She asked me if I could untie her. I said I couldn't do anything." [...] He later claimed that he was too afraid of Leigh to intervene or raise the alarm, saying: [...] "I thought they would batter me. If I'd said [...] they'd all have got me, wouldn't they? I didn't know what to do. I was too shocked to do anything." [...] While Capper was being held in the house, Leigh and Dudson met up with her sister's fiance Paul Barlow to help him repair his car. Barlow said: [...] "They could have told me there and then. The door would have been kicked down and I would have got Suzanne out. I did not think they were <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> savagery. Now all I want is ten minutes with them in a back room." ...|$|E
500|$|Dunn {{also claimed}} that Lodge put Diệm on hold {{in order to}} inform Conein where the Ngô {{brothers}} were so the generals could capture them. When confronted about Dunn's claim by a historian, Conein denied the account. It was also revealed that Conein had phoned the embassy early on the same morning to inquire about the generals' request for a plane to transport Diệm and Nhu out of Saigon. One of Lodge's staff told Conein that the plane {{would have to go}} directly to the faraway asylum-offering country, so that the brothers could not disembark at a nearby stopover country and stay there to foment a counter-coup. Conein was told that the nearest plane that was <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> a long range flight was in Guam, and it would take 24 hours to make the necessary arrangements. Minh was astounded and told Conein that the generals could not hold Diệm for that period. Conein did not suspect a deliberate delay by the American embassy. In contrast, a US Senate investigative commission in the early 1970s raised a provocative thought: [...] "One wonders what became of the US military aircraft that had been dispatched to stand by for Lodge's departure, scheduled for the previous day." [...] The historian Mark Moyar suspected that Lodge could have flown Diệm to Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines, which was under American jurisdiction, before taking him to the final destination. Moyar speculated that [...] "when Lodge had offered the jet the day before, he had done it to induce Diệm to give up {{at a time when the}} outcome of the insurrection was very much in doubt. Now that the coup clearly had succeeded, Lodge no longer needed to offer such an incentive." ...|$|E
