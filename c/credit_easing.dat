40|$|Housing {{prices and}} {{household}} borrowing {{are expected to}} be tightly connected to each other. Better availability of <b>credit</b> <b>eases</b> liquidity constraints of households, which is likely to lead to higher demand for housing. On the other hand, housing prices may significantly influence household borrowing through various wealth effects. Employing time series econometrics this study shows that since the financial liberalization in the late 1980 s there has been a significant two-way interaction between housing prices and housing loan stock in Finland. Before the financial deregulation the interaction was substantially weaker. Furthermore, housing appreciation has a notable positive impact on the amount of consumption loans withdrawn by households. It appears that there is no similar relationship between stock price movements and household borrowing. Understanding the two-way interaction between housing prices and credit is of importance, since the interdependence is likely to augment boom-bust cycles in the economy and increase the fragility of the financial sector. lending, borrowing, housing, dynamics...|$|R

50|$|<b>Credit</b> <b>easing</b> {{involves}} {{increasing the}} money supply, which presents inflationary risks that could weaken the dollar {{and make it}} less desirable as a reserve currency, affecting {{the ability of the}} U.S. government to finance budget deficits. The Fed is lending against increasingly risky collateral and in great amounts. The challenge to reduce the money supply at the right cadence and amount will be unprecedented once the economy is on firmer footing. Further, reducing the money supply as the economy begins to recover may place downward pressure against economic growth. In other words, raising the money supply to cushion a downturn will have a dampening effect on the subsequent upturn. There is also risk of inflation and devaluation of the currency. Critics have argued that worthy borrowers can still get credit and that <b>credit</b> <b>easing</b> (and government intervention more generally) is really an attempt to maintain a debt-driven standard of living that was unsustainable.|$|E
50|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 33AD is largely {{considered to be}} caused by <b>credit</b> <b>easing</b> policies that Tiberius took in order to limit the Aristocrats' wealth and land-ownership, and done in response to Augustus's massive private and public expenditures. Prior to 33AD, Augustus engaged in lavish spending in the public and private sector, while greatly encouraging land ownership and investment in real estate. Augustus thought that all citizens should have access to land and money. As a result, he aggressively engaged in a massive extension of credit into the real estate and public sector, and engaged in riskier and riskier loans. Due to his policies, land and real estate prices rose dramatically, benefitting his wealthy and noble land-owner friends who owned large amounts of property and invested heavily in real estate. Tiberius noticed such collusion, and looked to curb the amount of land that the wealthy and elites owned, as well as control the rapidly inflating money supply. He engaged in heavy austerity policies such as ordering for all loans be paid off immediately, and began confiscating property from the wealthy land-owners, in what is now known as monetary easing. By restricting loans for land purchasing, and the demand to pay loans in full, debtors were forced to sell off their property and real estate, which drastically dropped real estate and land prices. Paired with Tiberius' <b>credit</b> <b>easing</b> policy and the Senate naively demanding that people continue to invest in land despite what was going on, massive deflation occurred which ultimately cause the market to collapse. This {{financial crisis}} and Tiberius' engagement in Quantitative easing is one of the earliest records of monetary policy being used to adjust economic conditions. Some of Tiberius's practices are still used in monetary policy today.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyses}} disadoption {{of water}} harvesting technologies in Ethiopia {{where the average}} disadiption rate in the sample areas {{is as high as}} 42 %. Given that Ethiopia is a drought-prone country with 95 % of its crop production being rain-fed, such a high disadoption rate for irrigation technologies is surprising and urges investigation. Using panel data on 332 Ethiopian farm households collected in 2005 and 2010 we estimate a logit model to identify factors underlying disadoption. We find farm-household, economic, technology-specific, and natural condition variables that relate to disadoption. Mainly, shortage of plastic-sheets, altitude, and distance to market increase disadoption whereas education, experience with water harvesting (learning-by-doing), farm profit, availability of family labour, access to <b>credit,</b> <b>ease</b> of selling output, growing perennial crops, and distance from natural water sources decrease the probability of disadiption. There is no evidence that malaria has a significant effect on disadoption. Based on these findings, improved supply of plastic sheets and motor pumps, and advise to afmers on appropriate crops, credit and improved market accesses could ontribute to decreasing disadoption of water harvesting technologies...|$|R
5000|$|In {{introducing}} the Federal Reserve's {{response to the}} 2008-9 financial crisis, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke distinguished the new program, which he termed [...] "credit easing", from Japanese-style quantitative easing. In his speech, he announced, Our approach—which {{could be described as}} [...] "credit easing"—resembles quantitative easing in one respect: It involves an expansion of the central bank's balance sheet. However, in a pure QE regime, the focus of policy is the quantity of bank reserves, which are liabilities of the central bank; the composition of loans and securities on the asset side of the central bank's balance sheet is incidental. Indeed, although the Bank of Japan's policy approach during the QE period was quite multifaceted, the overall stance of its policy was gauged primarily in terms of its target for bank reserves. In contrast, the Federal Reserve's <b>credit</b> <b>easing</b> approach focuses on the mix of loans and securities that it holds and on how this composition of assets affects credit conditions for households and businesses.|$|E
5000|$|The Bank of Canada, {{a federal}} crown corporation, has the {{responsibility}} of Canada's monetary system. During the period that John Crow was Governor of the Bank of Canada—1987 to 1994— there was a worldwide recession and the bank rate rose to around 14% and unemployment topped 11%. In 1991, with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in office, {{the federal government and}} the Bank of Canada announced a new inflation targeting monetary policy that has been the cornerstone of Canada's monetary and fiscal policy ever since. Although since that time inflation-targeting has been adopted by [...] "most advanced-world central banks", in 1991 it was innovative and Canada was an early adopter when the then-Finance Minister Michael Wilson approved the Bank of Canada's first inflation-targeting in the 1991 federal budget. The inflation target was set at 2 per cent, which is the midpoint of an inflation range of 1 to 3 per cent. They established a set of inflation-reduction targets in order to keep inflation [...] "low, stable and predictable" [...] and to foster [...] "confidence in the value of money," [...] contribute to Canada's sustained growth, employment gains and improved standard of living.

The Bank of Canada uses three unconventional instruments to achieve the inflation target: [...] "a conditional statement on the future path of the policy rate," [...] quantitative easing, and <b>credit</b> <b>easing.</b>|$|E

When the policy rate is sufficiently low, this set-up gives rise to an (il-) liquidity premium on non-eligible assets. Then, a quantitative easing policy, which increases the size of the central bank's balance sheet, can increase real activity and prices, while a <b>credit</b> <b>easing</b> policy, which changes the composition of the balance sheet, can lower interest rate spreads, stimulate real activity, and reduce prices.

40|$|Under the {{financial}} turbulence, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) had launched {{a series of}} unprecedented monetary policies in the late 1990 s and the early 2000 s. The conventional monetary policies were not effective under liquidity trap.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} {{a brief summary}} of {{non-traditional}} monetary policy measures currently adopted by G 7 central banks and their provisional evaluation {{in the light of}} the Bank of Japan (BOJ) 's experience during the period of 1998 - 2006. The paper points out that although unprecedented measures seem to have been adopted by major central banks since 2007, many of them have been tried in one way or another in earlier episodes of financial crises, especially by the BOJ during 1998 - 2006 and are in this sense not new. We summarize the BOJ's and G 7 central banks' policies based on a typology of policies that can be used even when interest rates are very low. Non-traditional policy measures can be classified into managing interest rate expectations, targeted asset purchases and quantitative easing, all of which were used by the BOJ. The so-called <b>credit</b> <b>easing</b> can be considered to be a part of targeted asset purchases. In the current episode, targeted asset purchases or <b>credit</b> <b>easing</b> has been employed by most central banks, while expectations management and (strong forms of) quantitative easing have not been widely used. We explore reasons for such a choice of policy strategy in the current period. In addition, some important lessons can be learned about the effectiveness of non-traditional policies from what the BOJ and the Japanese government did and did not do during the early to mid 1990 s and its ultimate failure to avoid deflation. ...|$|E
