50|$|The {{probability}} {{of success is}} a concept closely related to <b>conditional</b> <b>power</b> and predictive <b>power.</b> <b>Conditional</b> <b>power</b> is the {{probability of}} observing statistical significance given the observed data assuming the treatment effect parameter equals a specific value. <b>Conditional</b> <b>power</b> is often criticized for this assumption. If we know the exact value of the treatment effect, {{there is no need}} to do the experiment. To address this issue, we can consider <b>conditional</b> <b>power</b> in a Bayesian setting by considering the treatment effect parameter to be a random variable. Taking the expected value of the <b>conditional</b> <b>power</b> with respect to the posterior distribution of the parameter gives the predictive power. Predictive power can also be calculated in a frequentist setting. No matter how it is calculated, predictive power is a random variable since it is a conditional probability conditioned on randomly observed data. Both <b>conditional</b> <b>power</b> and predictive power use statistical significance as the success criterion. However, statistical significance is often not sufficient to define success. For example, a health authority often requires the magnitude of the treatment effect to be bigger than an effect which is merely statistically significant in order to support successful registration. In order to address this issue, we can extend <b>conditional</b> <b>power</b> and predictive power to the concept of probability of success. For probability of success, the success criterion is not restricted to statistical significance. It can be something else such as a clinical meaningful result.|$|R

In this paper, I argue that this causal criterion of property identity is unsatisfactory, because it fails to provide a sufficient condition for the identification of properties. My argument for this claim is based on the observation that the summing of properties does not entail the summing of the <b>conditional</b> <b>powers</b> that they bestow on an object, but, rather, in some cases their subtraction. If so, the following causal structure seems possible: There are two properties, A and B. Each bestows a different set of <b>conditional</b> <b>powers</b> on its bearer, but the conjunctive property A-and-B bestows exactly the same set of <b>conditional</b> <b>powers</b> as either A or B.

40|$|For a {{long-term}} randomized clinical trial, {{it has become}} a well-accepted practice to include interim analyses in trial protocols. In addition to design an efficacy monitoring plan, investigators often develop a futility monitoring plan as well to prevent continuing a trial that has little chance to demonstrate treatment efficacy. <b>Conditional</b> <b>power</b> is the probability that the final analysis will result in rejection of the null hypothesis given data accumulated at interim analysis and a prespecified effect size. Because of its nice interpretation of the projection to the end of study, the <b>conditional</b> <b>power</b> is often built in decision rules to stop the trial for futility at interim analysis. An aggressive rule for futility stopping sets a relatively large threshold for the <b>conditional</b> <b>power</b> which may result in significant loss of overall power of the study.

40|$|Background: Sharing masked interim {{results by}} the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) with non-DSMB members is an {{important}} issue that can affect trial integrity. Our survey's objective is to collect evidence to understand how seemingly masked interim results or result extrapolations are interpreted and discuss whether these results should be shared at interim. Methods: Conducted a 6 scenario-question survey asking trial experts how they interpreted three kinds of seemingly masked interim results or result extrapolation measures (interim combined event rate, adaptive <b>conditional</b> <b>power</b> and “unconditional” <b>conditional</b> <b>power).</b> Results: Thirty-one current Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials group affiliates were invited for survey participation (February 2015). Response rate: 71. 0 % (22 / 31). About half, 52. 6 % (95 % CI: 28. 9 %– 74. 0 %), (10 / 19), correctly indicated that the interim combined event rate can be interpreted in three ways (drug X doing better than placebo, worse than placebo or the same) if shared at interim. The majority, 72. 2 % (95 % CI: 46. 5 %– 89. 7 %), (13 / 18), correctly indicated that the adaptive <b>conditional</b> <b>power</b> suggests relative treatment group effects. The majority, 53. 3 % (95 % CI: 26. 6 %– 77. 0 %), (8 / 15), incorrectly indicated that the “unconditional” <b>conditional</b> <b>power</b> suggests relative treatment group effects. Discussion/Conclusion: Knowledge of these three results or result extrapolation measures should not be shared outside of the DSMB at interim as they may mislead or unmask interim results, potentially introducing trial bias. For example, the interim combined event rate can be interpreted in one of three ways potentially leading to mistaken guesswork about interim results. Knowledge of the adaptive <b>conditional</b> <b>power</b> by non-DSMB members is telling of relative treatment effects thus unmasking of interim results...|$|R

Classical Brownian motion (Bm) techniques for statistical monitoring of {{clinical trial}}s were widely used. <b>Conditional</b> <b>power</b> argument and α-spending function based boundary crossing probabilities are popular statistical hypothesis testing procedures under the assumption of Brownian motion. However, it is not rare that the assumptions of Brownian motion are only partially met for trial data.

Fractional Brownian motion does not hold Markov property and future observations depend {{not only on the}} present observations but also on the past ones.

40|$|Large-scale {{randomized}} {{clinical trials}} are usually {{used to compare}} therapeutic effect of a new treatment {{to that of a}} standard treatment. Interim analyses are often performed at several occasions prior to the definitive analysis so that investigators can stop a trial early for ethical or economic reasons if the accumulating data shows enough evidence of superiority or futility of the new treatment. It has been recognized that the boundaries for the test statistics at those interim analyses need to be adjusted so that the overall type I error can be properly controlled. In contrary to adjustment for multiple testing in general practice, the theory on adjustment on boundaries for interim analyses have been well developed in past decades because of their sequential nature. At an interim analysis, one may be interested in estimating the chance for demonstrating the expected efficacy benefit from the new treatment at the definitive analysis. <b>Conditional</b> <b>power</b> provides such assessment based on currently available empirical data. Here we review and compare the operating characteristics of some fundamental methods and extensions in regulating the spending of exit probabilities at interim analyses under the null so that the overall type I error is controlled at the desired nominal level. Then we review the development and calculation of <b>conditional</b> <b>power</b> under a few typical settings.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} two topics in multivariate statistics. The first part develops an inference procedure and fast computation {{tool for the}} modal clustering method proposed by Li et al. (2007). The modal clustering, based on the kernel density estimate, clusters data using their associations within a single mode, with the final number of clusters equaling the number of modes, otherwise known as the modality {{of the distribution of}} the data. This method provides a flexible tool for clustering data of low to moderate dimensions with arbitrary distributional shapes. In contrast to Li and colleagues, we expand their method by proposing a procedure that determines the number of clusters in the data. A test statistic and its asymptotic distribution are derived to assess the significance of each mode within the data. The inference procedure is tested on both simulated and real data sets. In addition, an R computing package is developed (Modalclust) that implements the modal clustering procedure using parallel processing which dramatically increases computing speed over the previously available method. This package is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). The second part of this dissertation develops methods of statistical monitoring of clinical trials with multiple co-primary endpoints, where success is defined as meeting both endpoints simultaneously. In practice, a group sequential design method is used to stop trials early for promising efficacy, and <b>conditional</b> <b>power</b> is used for futility stopping rules. In this dissertation we show that stopping boundaries for the group sequential design with multiple co-primary endpoints should be the same as those for studies with single endpoints. Lan and Wittes (1988) proposed the B-value tool to calculate the <b>conditional</b> <b>power</b> of single endpoint trials and we extend this tool to calculate the <b>conditional</b> <b>power</b> for studies with multiple co-primary endpoints.
