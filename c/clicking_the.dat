5|$|Drowned God uses a point-and-click {{interface}} {{and first}} person perspective typical of games similar to Myst of the mid- to late-1990s. The player navigates and {{interacts with the}} game world by <b>clicking</b> <b>the</b> mouse on {{different parts of the}} screen. The mouse cursor changes shape depending on the action clicking will perform: an arrow for moving to another location, a face with an arrow to pick up or place Tarot cards, and an Eye of Providence for activating or interacting with objects in the environment. Frequent cutscenes provide background information and advance the storyline.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in Hatoful Boyfriend {{is similar}} to most other visual novels for the PC, with the {{controls}} limited to the mouse and the only interactions being clicking to forward the game's narrative or to choose between multiple plot choices. The keyboard {{can also be used}} instead of the mouse, with the 'enter' key serving the same purpose as <b>clicking.</b> <b>The</b> save button can be employed at any point during the game, which also features several pages of save slots, allowing gameplay to be easily picked up from prior to a choice the player made. An arrow button in the upper right corner also allows the player to skip dialogue and interactions they have already experienced.|$|E

5|$|The player kills enemies {{by firing}} daggers from their fingers. There are two firing options: <b>clicking</b> <b>the</b> left-mouse button fires a shotgun-like blast of daggers {{with a wide}} spread, and holding the mouse button down fires a precise, {{continuous}} stream of daggers. Some enemies have weak spots indicated by red crystals on their bodies. Once dead, the red crystals are dropped and can be gathered by the player to obtain attack upgrades, such as increased damage and homing daggers. The player dies when coming into physical contact with an enemy or falling off the stage. At {{the top of the}} screen, a timer displays how long the playthrough has lasted. The player's best survival time is published on a global leaderboard. Accessed via the leaderboard, replays of playthroughs can be downloaded and watched from either a first-person view or a top-down perspective.|$|E

25|$|A {{station is}} set by specifying an artist or song, or a {{combination}} of multiple items of any kind in a single station. Listeners can tune into established genre stations, other users' stations or create their own stations based on their musical interests. Each track played can be responded to with favorable (thumbs up) or unfavorable (thumbs down) buttons, which determine if it should be played, and if similarly classified songs should be played in the station. A second negative response to the same artist will ban that artist from the selected station unless the user has marked the artist positively on another occasion or if that artist is listed under the station's variety. No response is applicable to musical attributes or to albums. An unfavorable response immediately stops play of the track. <b>Clicking</b> <b>the</b> thumbs down or skipping to the next song too many times in a row will result in a short ban of skips. Pandora also utilizes short advertisements between every couple of songs.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} LucasArts {{adventure}} games, Full Throttle is a single-player video {{game in which}} the player controls {{the actions of the}} player character from a third-person perspective using a computer mouse and point and click interface. By positioning the cursor and <b>clicking</b> <b>the</b> left mouse button, the player causes the player character, Ben, to move around a scene. In certain contexts the cursor will become an arrow (if Ben is on foot) or a directional road sign (if Ben is riding his motorcycle); clicking these causes Ben to travel to another scene. As with other LucasArts graphic adventure games of the era, dialogue plays a large part in the game, presenting story elements and information necessary to advance. During conversations with other characters, several choices of dialogue are presented. The currently selected choice is highlighted, and once clicked, the player character responds with the selected choice. Choosing the correct response allows the player to advance the conversation and ultimately advance the scene.|$|E
25|$|The ribbon, a {{panel that}} houses a fixed {{arrangement}} of command buttons and icons, organizes commands {{as a set}} of tabs, each grouping relevant commands. The ribbon is present in Microsoft Word 2007, Excel 2007, PowerPoint 2007, Access 2007 and some Outlook 2007 windows. The ribbon is not user customizable in Office 2007. Each application has a different set of tabs that exposes functions that the application offers. For example, while Excel has a tab for the graphing capabilities, Word does not; instead it has tabs to control the formatting of a text document. Within each tab, various related options may be grouped together. The ribbon is designed to make the features of the application more discoverable and accessible with fewer mouse clicks as compared to the menu-based UI used prior to Office 2007. Moving the mouse scroll wheel while on any of the tabs on the ribbon cycles—through the tabs. The ribbon can be minimized by double <b>clicking</b> <b>the</b> active section's title, such as the Home text in the picture below. Office 2007 does not natively support removing, modifying or replacing ribbon. Third party add-ins, however, can bring menus and toolbars back to Office 2007 or customize the ribbon commands. Add-ins that restore menus and toolbars include Classic Menu for Office, ToolbarToggle, and Ubitmenu. Others like RibbonCustomizer enable the customization of ribbons. Office 2010 does allow user customization of the ribbon out of the box.|$|E

[...] Although the action unfolds in real-time, the player can pause the game by <b>clicking</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Freeze" [...] button and entering [...] "Freeze Time". [...] While in this mode, every unit stops its motion while a timer runs down; the player can freely issue and modify orders to the Marines. [...] Once the timer is depleted or the Freeze button is clicked again, every unit resumes its movement.

500|$|The game {{is played}} {{primarily}} through [...] "pointing and clicking" [...] with the mouse and a few keyboard commands. This system {{is also used to}} control the spacecraft, a breakaway from the traditional use of joysticks for space flight simulators. Observing their spacecraft from the rear, players fly their ships by moving the mouse in the direction they want the vessels to go. Freelancers spacecraft follow simplistic flight dynamics; however, a dash of realism is implemented by allowing the vessels to cut power to their engines and turn to face any direction while drifting along their original pathconservation of momentum. <b>Clicking</b> <b>the</b> mouse button shoots the ship's weapons at the location of the cursor. The interface has no radar display; the location of objects not shown on the screen are indicated by pointers at the screen's edges.

500|$|The player {{begins by}} {{creating}} a character, for whom traits such as gender, character class and skills may be selected. Skills range from diplomacy and lockpicking to blacksmithing. The game starts in the castle of Lord British, through which the player accesses other dimensions. The player character gains experience points by fighting, completing quests and exploring. During combat, the player attacks by <b>clicking</b> <b>the</b> screen: more damage is dealt when the player presses and holds the attack button. Depending on where the player clicks, different types of attacks—such as thrusts and slashes—occur. The player may cast spells by using an appropriate combination of [...] "runestones", which are collected throughout the game. When enough experience points have been accumulated, the player character levels up and gains hit points. Experience points also grant [...] "skill points", which allow the character to increase skill proficiency. Unlike in , skills are not improved at shrines; rather, they are increased by training with NPCs at the castle or in other dimensions.|$|E
500|$|Switching to the Terminator View Screen {{offers a}} first-person {{perspective}} of the mission through the Marines' eyes. [...] The Screen contains five monitors: a large primary monitor {{at the bottom and}} four smaller secondary displays arrayed above. [...] The primary monitor displays the view of the Marine under the player's control. [...] The character is moved by pressing the keyboard's cursor keys or <b>clicking</b> <b>the</b> directional arrows next to the monitor. [...] The mouse is also used to aim and shoot at targets, although the computer determines if an accurate shot kills the target. [...] The secondary monitors show the views of other squad members. [...] Although the player cannot control the movements of these Marines through these interfaces, he or she can click them to shoot the Marines' weapons at the centre of their views. [...] However, the player can take full control of a Marine by switching the character's view to the primary monitor.|$|E
