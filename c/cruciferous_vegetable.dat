High and low <b>cruciferous</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption was defined based on a median split in the control group.

The GSTA 1 polymorphism may have a modifying role as well: the OR for higher intake compared with lower intake was 1. 57 (0. 93 - 2. 65) for individuals homozygous for the low expression variant (TT genotype). This seemed to be stronger with younger age and higher red meat intake. <b>Cruciferous</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption and the combined GSTA 1 and GSTP 1 genotypes showed a statistically significant interaction (P = 0. 034).

Objective: We investigated the independent and combined effects of <b>cruciferous</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake and the GSTP 1 Ile 105 Val genetic polymorphism on breast cancer risk. Design: Analyses included 3035 cases and 3037 population controls who were participating in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study and for whom diet and genetic data were complete (87 % of cases and 85 % of controls). Results: With the use of multivariate logistic regression, the GSTP 1 Val/Val genotype was significantly associated with greater breast cancer risk (OR 1. 50; 95 % CI: 1. 12, 1. 99). The association was significantly greater in premenopausal women (OR 1. 69; 95 % CI: 1. 17, 2. 43) than in postmenopausal women (OR 1. 20; 95 % CI: 0. 74, 1. 92). Total <b>cruciferous</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake was not significantly associated with breast cancer risk, although subjects reporting greater turnip (P for trend 0. 001) and Chinese cabbage (P for trend 0. 049) intakes had a significantly lower postmenopausal breast cancer risk.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Cruciferous</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake is {{inversely}} {{associated with}} the risk of several cancers. Isothiocyanates (ITC) are hypothesized to be the major bioactive constituents contributing to these cancer-preventive effects. The polymorphic glutathione- S -transferase (GST) gene family encodes several enzymes which catalyze ITC degradation in vivo. Methods We utilized high throughput proteomics methods to examine how human serum peptides (the "peptidome") change in response to <b>cruciferous</b> <b>vegetable</b> feeding in individuals of different GSTM 1 genotypes. In two randomized, crossover, controlled feeding studies (EAT and 2 EAT) participants consumed a fruit- and vegetable-free basal diet and the basal diet supplemented with cruciferous vegetables. Serum samples collected {{at the end of}} the feeding period were fractionated and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry spectra were obtained. Peak identification/alignment computer algorithms and mixed effects models were used to analyze the data. Results After analysis of spectra from EAT participants, 24 distinct peaks showed statistically significant differences associated with <b>cruciferous</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake. Twenty of these peaks were driven by their GSTM 1 genotype (i. e., GSTM 1 + or GSTM 1 - null). When data from EAT and 2 EAT participants were compared by joint processing of spectra to align a common set, 6 peaks showed consistent changes in both studies in a genotype-dependent manner. The peaks at 6700 m/z and 9565 m/z were identified as an isoform of transthyretin (TTR) and a fragment of zinc α 2 -glycoprotein (ZAG), respectively. Conclusions <b>Cruciferous</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake in GSTM 1 + individuals led to changes in circulating levels of several peptides/proteins, including TTR and a fragment of ZAG.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} if cruciferous vegetables and coffee, two dietary inducers of glutatione-S-transferases, interact with GSTM- 1 genotype to alter risk of colon cancer. Data were available on 1579 incident cases of adenocarcinoma of the colon and 1898 population-based controls. Intake of cruciferous vegetables, specific types of <b>cruciferous</b> <b>vegetable,</b> and coffee were not associated with colon cancer; GSTM- 1 genotype did not modify these associations. However, age at diagnosis and cigarette smoking appeared to be important effect modifiers of the associations between GSTM- 1, cruciferous vegetables and colon cancer. Among GSTM- 1 null individuals, < 55 years at diagnosis, we observed an inverse association between colon cancer and high levels of <b>cruciferous</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake relative to people who did not eat cruciferous vegetables (ORs 0. 23 95 ␌I 0. 10 - 0. 54); broccoli was the <b>cruciferous</b> <b>vegetable</b> associated with the strongest inverse association (OR 0. 30 95 ␌I 0. 13 - 0. 70). Among younger individuals who were GSTM- 1 present (relative to those with GSTM- 1 null), we observed an inverse association with colon cancer regardless of level of <b>cruciferous</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake (OR 0. 74 95 ␌I 0. 30 - 1. 79 for no intake; OR 0. 44 95 ␌I 0. 21 - 0. 92 for < 4 servings/week; and OR 0. 44 95 ␌I 0. 19 - 0. 99 for 4 servings/week). These associations were further modified by cigarette smoking. People < 65 years of age who smoked had a greater reduction in risk of colon cancer from consumption of cruciferous vegetables than non-smokers at the same age.

Cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli and cabbage, contain distinctive compounds that can be utilized by gut bacteria. For example, glucosinolates can be hydrolyzed by certain bacteria, and dietary fibers can be fermented by a range of species. We hypothesized that <b>cruciferous</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption would alter growth of certain bacteria, thereby altering bacterial community composition. We tested this hypothesis in a randomized, crossover, controlled feeding study. Fecal samples were collected from 17 participants at the end of 2 14 -d intake periods: a low-phytochemical, low-fiber basal diet (i. e. refined grains without fruits or vegetables) and a high (“double”) <b>cruciferous</b> <b>vegetable</b> diet [basal diet + 14 g cruciferous vegetables/(kg body weight⋅d) ]. Fecal bacterial composition was analyzed by the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (tRFLP) method using the bacterial 16 S ribosomal RNA gene and nucleotide sequencing. Using blocked multi-response permutation procedures analysis, we found that overall bacterial community composition differed between the 2 consumption periods (δ = 0. 603; P = 0. 011). The bacterial community response to cruciferous vegetables was individual-specific, as revealed by nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination analysis. Specific tRFLP fragments that characterized each of the diets were identified using indicator species analysis. Putative species corresponding to these fragments were identified through gene sequencing as Eubacterium hallii, Phascolarctobacterium faecium, Burkholderiales spp., Alistipes putredinis, and Eggerthella spp. In conclusion, human gut bacterial community composition was altered by <b>cruciferous</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption, which could ultimately influence gut metabolism of bioactive food components and host exposure to these compounds...|$|E

Objective: To investigate the effects of daily intake of an aqueous solution of watercress on the growth of the experimental Ehrlich tumor (EET). Methods: Swiss mice were divided into three groups A, B and C (n = 6). The animals from the control group (A) received, by gavage, 0. 05 ml of saline throughout the experiment. The animals in group B, from {{the first day of the}} experiment, received daily, by gavage, 0. 05 ml of watercress aqueous solution (0. 5 g/ml).
