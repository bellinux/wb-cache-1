5|$|At {{the church}} council, Reverend Lovejoy tells Marge to use Christmas to bribe her back. Marge bakes cookies, decorates the home, and has Ralph and Milhouse dress as a pony in {{wrapping}} paper to tempt her, but Lisa {{runs from the}} home when she realizes what is happening. At the Buddhist temple she tells Richard Gere her family tried to trick her, but Gere informs her that while Buddhism is about one finding inner peace, it is also about respecting the diversity of other religions based on love and compassion - thus, Lisa is free to celebrate any holiday with her family including Christmas. Lisa goes back home, falling asleep beside the Christmas tree and tells everyone {{that she will be}} celebrating Christmas with them and continue paying lip service to Christianity while practicing Buddhism {{for the rest of her}} life. As Marge takes her to the kitchen to get some cookies for her, Lisa asks about her pony, and Marge tries unsuccessfully to <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> as Lisa calls out for her gift.|$|E
5|$|Kunivas' {{condition}} worsens, and Korris, Konmel, and Worf {{are present}} when he dies, {{and the three}} let out a fierce roar as per Klingon custom. As they return to the Klingons' quarters, Konmel is disappointed that Kunivas was not killed by an enemy, leading Worf to question {{the nature of the}} attack on the freighter; Korris and Konmel quickly <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> Worf forces Korris to reveal the truth: the three had commandeered the freighter, in order to seek out a place they could live as true Klingons, and the damage to the freighter was a result of a battle with a Klingon ship. When the two are seen near the ship's battle bridge, hoping to steal the drive section and escape the crew on the saucer, they are placed in the brig.|$|E

25|$|This {{leads to}} a {{discussion}} of the humans' sex organs, especially Nancy's breasts. The lizards do not have these organs. Nancy shows Sarah, who is fascinated. Leslie also wants to see, but Charlie is uncomfortable with the idea. To <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> Charlie asks about their children. Sarah and Leslie have produced seven thousand eggs. Leslie is appalled when he learns that the humans do not lay eggs. Nancy explains human gestation and that they have three children.|$|E
25|$|During {{the ride}} the car passed several service {{stations}} {{but the man}} did not stop. For about 90 minutes he drove back and forth around the backroads near Tracy. When Johns asked why he was not stopping, he would <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> When the driver finally stopped at an intersection, Johns jumped out with her daughter and hid in a field. The driver searched for her using his flashlight telling her {{that he would not}} hurt her, before eventually giving up. Unable to find her, he got back into the car and drove off. Johns hitched a ride to the police station in Patterson.|$|E
25|$|The band's {{break-up}} {{was announced}} shortly before Live 'n' Kickins release in early 1974, and Bruce released his fourth solo album Out of the Storm later that year. Also in 1974 he {{featured on the}} title track of Frank Zappa's album Apostrophe ('), recorded in November 1972. Bruce was credited with bass and co-authorship on the improvised track. When asked about Zappa in a 1992 interview, Bruce tried to <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> and jokingly insisted that he had played only cello parts. Outtakes from the session were released on the archival release The Crux Of The Biscuit in 2016. In 1973 Bruce recorded bass guitar for Lou Reed's Berlin album, playing on all but two tracks.|$|E

2500|$|Apple Dave â€“ A {{very strange}} rock star {{with the head}} of an apple. He likes to [...] "make your mum horny". He usually makes an {{appearance}} in order for Weebl to avoid answering a difficult/unexplanatory question.

[...] Cunningham tried to <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> Ultimately he did not deny it.|$|E
2500|$|Spooner {{says that}} Foster, who now reappears, should have pursued {{his dream of}} being a poet, instead of working for Hirst. Spooner shows great {{interest}} in seeing Hirst's photo album, but both Briggs and Foster discourage this. All four are now drinking champagne, and Foster, for his own pride and dignity's sake, abruptly asserts that he desired to work in this house of his own choice, where he feels privileged to serve as famous a writer as Hirst. Suddenly, Spooner asks desperately that Hirst consider hiring him as well, verbosely praising his own work ethic and other virtues. After all this, Hirst merely replies [...] "Let's <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> for the last time", and after a pause worriedly asks [...] "What have I said?" [...] Foster explains definitively that Hirst's statement means that he (Hirst) {{will never be able}} to <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> ever again. Hirst thinks back to his youth, when he mistakenly thought he saw a drowned body in a lake. Spooner now comments, [...] "No. You are in no man's land. Which never moves, which never changes, which never grows older, but which remains forever, icy and silent." [...] Hirst responds [...] "I'll drink to that!" [...] and the lights fade slowly to black.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2006, the {{unofficial}} website reported that The League of Gentlemen were to 'reunite' {{at the beginning}} of 2007, most likely to plan for the fourth series. Shearsmith and Pemberton appeared on The Russell Brand Show on 22 December 2006. When asked [...] "Will there be any more of The League of Gentlemen?", Shearsmith simply replied [...] "Yes" [...] but was quick to <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> and not reveal anything about a new series. On the official website, Shearsmith's blog entry for 23 May 2007 stated that the troupe had recently met up in London's West End: [...] "We discussed our next project - it seems we have hit upon something. Early days - but exciting nevertheless." ...|$|E

2500|$|An Italian {{libretto}} {{was quickly}} prepared under Verdi's supervision by the poet Ettore Caimi. The composer {{was aware that}} in Italy at that time, {{it would have been}} impossible to place the story in Sicily, as he notes to his publisher Giulio Ricordi in April 1855: [...] "I shall... (<b>change)</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> so as to render it acceptable for Italian theatres". Based on Scribe's suggestions for changing the location - [...] "I suggested that the Duke of Alba should just pack his bags once more and move to Lisbon" [...] - it became Portugal in 1640 while under Spanish control. Therefore, the title was changed to Giovanna de Guzman. [...] Overall, Verdi was not happy with the translation, which Budden regards as [...] "one of the worst ever perpetrated. However, some improvements were made when the opera reverted to its translated Italian title after 1861.|$|E
2500|$|Box re-enters {{from his}} {{dressing}} room, and they confront {{each other for}} the first time. Each orders the other to leave. Cox produces his receipt for rent, to prove the room is his, and Box does likewise. Realising they have been duped, they call for Bouncer, who arrives and promptly tries to <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> with yet another reprise of [...] "Rataplan! Rataplan!" [...] Finally cornered, he admits that the room belongs to both of them, but he says that he will have his little back second floor room ready later the same day. Both lodgers say they will take it, which Bouncer quickly points out makes no sense whatsoever. He leaves them to decide which will vacate the current room. Each suggests the other should leave, but neither will budge. Finally, they realise that it is all Bouncer's fault, and they may as well be friends. They serenade each other on the guitar.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} the band {{recorded}} White Light/White Heat, Nico had quit and Warhol had been fired, both against Cale's wishes. Warhol's replacement as manager was Steve Sesnick. In September 1968, Cale left the band at Reed's behest. Morrison and Tucker were discomfited by Reed's tactics but continued with the group. Cale's replacement was Boston-based musician Doug Yule, who played bass, keyboards and who would soon share lead vocal duties in the band with Reed. The group now took on a more pop-oriented sound and acted more {{as a vehicle for}} Reed to develop his songwriting craft. The group released two albums with this lineup: 1969's The Velvet Underground and 1970's Loaded. The latter included two of the group's most commercially successful songs, [...] "Rock and Roll" [...] and [...] "Sweet Jane". After the band's move to Atlantic Records' Cotillion label, their new manager pushed Reed to <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> matter of his songs to lighter topics in hopes of commercial success. Loaded had taken more time to record than the previous three albums together, but had not broken them through to a wider audience.|$|E
