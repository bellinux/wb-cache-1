That any knew of this panel outside my own household, I was doubtful. Yet the leader of the band did not hesitate a moment. He stepped directly to the panel, touched the <b>concealed</b> <b>button,</b> and as the door swung open he stood aside while his companions entered with me. Then he closed the panel behind him and followed us.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} type of rekel is the {{double-breasted}} variety, but many other styles exist. These include a single-breasted version (typical of the Breslover Hasidim), and <b>concealed</b> <b>button</b> version, which many Gerer, Bobover and Sanz-Klausenburger Hasidim wear. There is also a single breasted version with a shawl collar and attached gartel. Several styles of unlined rekelech exist, which are typically worn in hot weather, and often conform to the styles noted above. All rekelech share a right over left button style, the opposite of what one would find on most men's clothing. Unlike most long coats rekelech tend not have walking vents, but some of the <b>concealed</b> <b>button</b> and single-breasted rekelech do.|$|E

50|$|In the United States military, the German Armed Forces Badge for Weapons Proficiency (Schützenschnur) {{is one of}} the few pre-approved foreign awards, {{requiring}} {{no individual}} approval request to be forwarded up the serviceman's chain of command to the United States Senate for acceptance. Occasion and manner of wear of the Schützenschnur are governed by the individual services' uniform regulations (e.g., Army Regulation 670-1); such regulations additionally specify the placement of the <b>concealed</b> <b>button</b> on the uniform with which to affix the Schützenschnur's rope. Section 22-18 part b of the DA PAM 670-1 states the following.|$|E

5000|$|According to the TASS news agency, the {{aircraft}} [...] "had to alter its course {{as a result}} of forcible actions of an armed criminal on board and landed in the northeastern part of the People's Republic of China". In 1970, following the hijacking of Aeroflot Flight 244, aircraft captains in the Soviet Union were allowed to possess arms on board; but Abramyan, despite being armed, decided not to resist as it required unbuckling his seat's safety harness.

50|$|The guerrera, or {{campaign}} jacket {{worn with}} the rayadillo uniform {{was made of}} deep blue flannel and had two breast pockets with flaps. It was fastened by a single row of seven metal buttons. The jacket was patterned on the tunic officially prescribed for general wear by the infantry of the Spanish Peninsular Army on August 18, 1886. The guerrera was worn by Spanish troops stationed in the Philippines, Cuba and Puerto Rico. The Philippine-issue rayadillo patterned guerrera was distinguishable from those issued in Cuba and Puerto Rico by a standing collar and <b>concealed</b> <b>button</b> fly front.

5000|$|Various new and {{different}} forms of collar emerged in the 1920s. They diminished in sizes by the 1950s, but were huge in the 1930s. At {{the beginning of the}} 1970s, popular styles included the rounded collar, sausage dog collar, then extra wide collar and double cuffs from shirts, that fell on them often from fashions relating to synthetic fabrics like usually polyester. At the beginning of the 1960s bubic bangs came back, then later wide collars. The fashion of standing and federal collar, loops, rounded collars, haemoglobin collars , and the smallest collar, sometimes with <b>concealed</b> <b>button</b> fly on a [...] "smoking blouse", attached folds and stressed set-in-followed in the 1980s.

5000|$|The khaki Service Dress tunic adopted for the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in 1912 had a wide cloth panel (a plastron) {{across the}} chest with <b>concealed</b> <b>buttons,</b> {{since it was}} thought that the usual button {{arrangement}} would be liable to catch on the bracing wires used on aircraft at that time. This tunic was popularly known as the [...] "maternity jacket". The Naval Wing of the RFC, later the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS), wore naval uniform. On 1 April 1918, the RFC and RNAS merged to form the Royal Air Force (RAF). Initially, the uniforms of the former services continued in use, but on 1 May, an [...] "interim" [...] RAF uniform was approved which was basically the standard khaki Army Service Dress. A light blue version of Service Dress was approved for daily wear on 10 July, but this proved highly unpopular and many persisted with their old outfits. Finally, on 1 October 1919, the RAF Service Dress of a blue-grey colour, known as Air Force blue, was introduced.|$|R

50|$|The cassock (or soutane) {{comes in}} a number of styles or cuts, though no {{particular}} symbolism attaches to these. A Roman cassock often has a series of buttons down the front - sometimes thirty-three (symbolic of the years of the life of Jesus). In some English-speaking countries these buttons may be merely ornamental, with a <b>concealed</b> fly-front <b>buttoning,</b> known as a Chesterfield front, used to fasten the garment. A French cassock also has buttons sewn to the sleeves after the manner of a suit, and a slightly broader skirt. An Ambrosian cassock has a series of only five buttons under the neck, with a sash on the waist. A Jesuit cassock, in lieu of buttons, has a fly fastened with hooks at the collar and is bound at the waist with a cincture knotted on the right side.|$|R
60|$|The {{figure of}} the rider was thin, tall, and slender, but remarkably athletic, bony, and sinewy; like one who had all his life {{followed}} those violent exercises which prevent the human form from increasing in bulk, while they harden and confirm by habit its muscular powers. His face, sharp-featured, sun-burnt, and freckled, had a sinister expression of violence, impudence, and cunning, each of which seemed alternately to predominate over the others. Sandy-coloured hair, and reddish eyebrows, from under which looked forth his sharp grey eyes, completed the inauspicious outline of the horseman's physiognomy. He had pistols in his holsters, and another pair peeped from his belt, though he had taken some pains to <b>conceal</b> them by <b>buttoning</b> his doublet. He wore a rusted steel head piece; a buff jacket of rather an antique cast; gloves, of which that for the right hand was covered with small scales of iron, like an ancient gauntlet; and a long broadsword completed his equipage.|$|R
5000|$|Amateur {{historians have}} {{accused her of}} betraying the family by taking money from them and later informing their guards that the Romanov {{children}} had sewed jewels into their clothing. She allegedly told Rodionov that [...] "The buttons on her coat aren't buttons, they are diamonds; the aigrette of that hat conceals a diamond from the shah of Persia; and that belt there - underneath it are ropes of pearls. Such a proposition has been completely disproven since the Bolsheviks had no idea the jewels were in the clothes until after the execution. Yurovsky stated [...] "They shot the daughters but nothing happened, then Yermakov set the bayonet in motion and that didn't help; then they were finally finished off by being shot the head. Only in the forest did I discover what hampered the shooting of the daughters." [...] According to King and Wilson, Yurovsky wrote in his 1922 memoirs about [...] "the damn valuables and jewels we knew they had concealed in their clothes when they arrived, which caused troubles to no end." [...] It is fact that Yurovsky explained that while the truck was stuck in the forest, [...] "some of Yermakov's people started to pull at the girls' blouses, where they discovered the valuables.".."Things that had been sewn into the daughters' clothing were discovered when the bodies began to be undressed..The daughters had bodices made up of diamonds and other precious stones that served {{not just as a}} receptacle for valuables but as protective armor. This is why neither bullets nor bayonets yielded results during the shooting and bayonet blows..there turned out to be eighteen pounds of such valuables." [...] One of the large diamonds that had been carefully covered and <b>concealed</b> in a <b>button</b> was never discovered by the Bolsheviks, and was later found by the Whites after they took Ekaterinburg, trampled into the mud at the grave site. The relic was identified by two former servants who had helped the Grand Duchesses sew the jewels into the clothing.|$|R
