5|$|It is {{important}} to also note that images of the family depend upon the specific source in which the image is found {{and the type of}} audience that the source aims to reach.

5|$|Many {{institutes of}} higher {{education}} teach music in Italy. About 75 music conservatories provide advanced training for future professional musicians. There are also many private music schools and workshops for instrument building and repair. Private teaching is also quite common in Italy. Elementary {{and high school students}} <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> have one or two weekly hours of music teaching, generally in choral singing and basic music theory, though extracurricular opportunities are rare. Though most Italian universities have classes in related subjects such as music history, performance is not a common feature of university education.|$|E

25|$|Promotion is {{not based}} solely on merit but on {{position}} attained, level of education, and seniority. Officers with advanced degrees (for which study at the National Defence Academy qualifies) <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> attain grade VIII before reaching the retirement age of sixty to sixty-five. Those with a baccalaureate degree <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> reach grade VII (colonel), and those without university training will retire as captains or majors.

It is common for NCOs to transfer at some stage in their careers to civilian status at the equivalent grade, either in the Ministry for National Defence or in the police or prison services after further training.|$|E

25|$|Persistent {{hypertension}} {{is one of}} {{the risk}} factors for strokes, heart attacks, heart failure and arterial aneurysms, and {{is the leading cause of}} chronic kidney failure. Even moderate elevation of arterial pressure leads to shortened life expectancy.

25|$|As a result, when ex-convicts Richard Hickock (Lee Pace) and Perry Smith (Daniel Craig) are apprehended in Las Vegas and extradited to Holcomb, {{permission}} {{is given}} to Capote to interview them in their cells. The two men are tried and found guilty, but a lengthy period of appeals begins.

25|$|The Preston curve {{indicates}} that individuals born in richer countries, on average, <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> {{live longer than}} those born in poor countries. However, the link between income and life expectancy flattens out. This means that at low levels of per capita income, further increases in income are associated with large gains in life expectancy, but at high levels of income, increased income has little associated change in life expectancy. In other words, if the relationship is interpreted as being causal, then there are diminishing returns to income in terms of life expectancy.|$|E
25|$|The Department of Medical Equipments in the Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME) is {{responsible}} for supervising imports in this segment, but the import and distribution of such equipment is mostly handled by the private sector. Iran has undergone the primary stages of development in terms of industrialisation and a rather strong indigenous manufacturing capability exists in the country. Therefore, one <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> find a handful of local producers for basic medical equipment, making {{it very hard to}} penetrate into the Iranian market for similar imported ones.|$|E
25|$|The FAO program prepares U.S. {{military}} officers and officers of allied nations {{to be leading}} regional experts and to serve in key political-military assignments throughout Eurasia.

25|$|While most medical {{transcription}} agencies prefer {{candidates with}} a minimum of one year experience, formal instruction is not a requirement, and there is no mandatory test. Some hospitals require nothing more than a diploma for employment as a medical transcriptionist. The average pay range for an in-house MT in a hospital setting is $8/hr. However, MT/HDS <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> receive anywhere from $12-$19 an hour, depending if they are working in a union or non-union environment. This large gap is because the job is based on production, so the more an MT can produce, the more they can make.|$|E

It has around 357 pupils from Year 3 (approximately 7) to Year 8 (aged 13). The junior school {{has its own}} faculty of staff, own administration and management and a self-contained block of classrooms. This was complemented in 2003 by a new building which contained classrooms and other facilities, primarily for Year 7 and 8 pupils. The majority of Year 8 pupils <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> transfer into King's Senior School. The Head of the junior school is R Whymark.|$|E
25|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} may be self-limiting, frequently recurring, chronic or progressive. Most {{patients have}} severe symptoms lasting {{a few weeks}} to six months. 15 to 50 percent of cases involve recurrent bouts of arthritis. Chronic arthritis or sacroiliitis occurs in 15–30 percent of cases. Repeated attacks over many years are common, and patients sometimes end up with chronic and disabling arthritis, heart disease, amyloid deposits, ankylosing spondylitis, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, cardiac conduction abnormalities, or aortitis with aortic regurgitation. However, most people with reactive arthritis <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> live normal life spans and maintain a near-normal lifestyle with modest adaptations to protect the involved organs.|$|E

25|$|One {{national}} park, the Corcovado National Park, is internationally renowned among ecologists for its biodiversity (including big {{cats and}} tapirs) and is where visitors <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> see {{an abundance of}} wildlife. Corcovado is the one park in Costa Rica where all four Costa Rican monkey species can be found. These include the white-headed capuchin, the mantled howler, the endangered Geoffroy's spider monkey, and the Central American squirrel monkey, found only on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica and {{a small part of}} Panama, and considered endangered until 2008, when its status was upgraded to vulnerable. Deforestation, illegal pet-trading, and hunting are the main reasons for its threatened status.|$|E
25|$|The {{breach of}} a {{procedural}} legitimate expectation {{has been recognized}} {{as a form of}} procedural impropriety. This involves the idea that if a public authority has made a representation to an individual who will be affected by a decision that he or she <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> be consulted in advance of the decision being taken but does not do so, this is unlawful. The representation giving rise to such a legitimate expectation may either be an express promise given on behalf of an authority, or the existence of a regular practice which the claimant can reasonably expect to continue. These principles were accepted as part of Singapore law in Re Siah Mooi Guat.|$|E
25|$|Salaries {{of draft}} {{selections}} are fixed for two years.

Upon successfully trading to the Sydney Swans in 2013, marquee player Lance Franklin signed a 9-year contract with the club, reportedly worth over $10million and resulting in subsequent payments of $1.8million annually in consecutive seasons. The Total Player Earnings (TPE) – or total amount of revenue spent on reimbursement of AFL listed players – {{at the conclusion of the}} 2012 season was $173.7million, up by 13 per cent from $153.7million in 2011.|$|E
