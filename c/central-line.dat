40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{evidence-based}} project was to discover {{an effective way to}} decrease <b>central-line</b> associated bloodstream infections in patients within a hospital setting. Background: <b>Central-line</b> associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) are primary bloodstream infections in patients that had a central line in place within 48 hours before the development of the infection. CLABSI are associated with significant morbidity and mortality and effective methods for their prevention are needed. Method: A search was conducted using CINAHL, Google Scholar, and Ovid Nursing Database for current research experiments and meta-analysis regarding the reduction of <b>central-line</b> infections. Results: The use of Chlorhexidine-impregnated Dressings significantly reduced CLABSI rates. With chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings, there is a significant benefit for prevention of catheter colonization, the adverse effects were also rare and minor.

40|$|BackgroundPatients in the {{neonatal}} {{intensive care}} unit (NICU) {{are at high risk}} for healthcare-associated infections. Variability in reported infection rates among NICUs exists, possibly related to differences in prevention strategies. A better understanding of current prevention practices may help identify prevention gaps and areas for further research. MethodsWe surveyed infection control staff in NICUs reporting to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) to assess strategies used to prevent MRSA transmission and <b>central-line</b> associated bloodstream infections in NICUs. ResultsStaff from 162 of 342 NICUs responded (response rate 47. 3 %). Most (92. 3 %) NICUs use <b>central-line</b> insertion and maintenance bundles, but maintenance practices varied, including agents used for antisepsis and frequency of dressing changes. Forty-two percent reported routine screening for MRSA colonization upon admission for all patients. Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) use for central line care for at least one indication (central line insertion, dressing changes, or port/cap antisepsis) was reported in 82 NICUs (51. 3 %). Among sixty-five NICUs responding to questions on CHG use restrictions, 46. 2 % reported no restrictions.

Surveillance definitions for primary BSI distinguish those that are microbiologically documented from those that are not.

We analyzed prospective onsite surveillance data of nosocomial infections in a medical intensive care unit. Of the 113 episodes of primary BSI, 33 (29 %) were microbiologically documented. The overall BSI infection rate was 19. 8 episodes per 1, 000 <b>central-line</b> days (confidence interval [CI] 95 %, 16. 1 to 23. 6); the rate fell to 5. 8 (CI 3. 8 to 7. 8) when only microbiologically documented episodes were considered.

We conclude that laboratory-based surveillance alone will underestimate the incidence of primary BSI and thus jeopardize benchmarking. Primary {{bloodstream infection}} (BSI) is a leading, infectious complication among critically ill patients (1). It represents about 15 % of all nosocomial infections (2, 3) and affects approximately 1 % of all hospitalized patients (4), with an incidence rate of 5 per 1, 000 <b>central-line</b> days (5). The impact on patient outcome is tremendous; BSI increases the mortality rate (6, 7), prolongs patient stay in an intensive care unit (ICU) and in the hospital (7 – 9), and generates substantial extra costs (7, 8). For these reasons, surveillance and prevention of BSI are high priorities, and several interventions have proven to be effective (10 – 16). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance definitions of BSI delineate two distinct entities: infections that are microbiologically documented, and those that are not, called clinical sepsis (17). Although surveillance of the former can be laboratory based, detection of clinical sepsis requires prospective on-site surveillance.

30|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{methods that}} are currently accepted worldwide must be borne in mind, because differences in the methods used clearly introduced bias in trials on preventive strategies. In current French recommendations for patients with BSI, a positive quantitative [12, 13] or semiquantitative [14] catheter culture {{is needed to determine}} that the catheter caused the BSI. Alternatively, simultaneous comparative quantitative blood samples [15] or the difference in time to positivity of blood from the hub and peripheral blood [16] should be determined. However, the Centers for Disease Control definition of <b>central-line</b> associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) [17], which does not take catheter culture results into account, often is used as an acceptable surrogate. This definition requires a single blood culture positive for a pathogen (or two cultures positive for a common commensal) not recovered from any nonblood cultures during the 3 days preceding and 7 days following. This definition is insufficiently accurate [18, 19]. Considerable variability occurs among experts [20, 21] and hospitals [18] in the classification of infections as CLABSI or secondary bacteremia. In addition, this definition is obviously dependent of the number of blood cultures performed before introducing new antimicrobials and the number of nonblood cultures performed to look for an infectious focus responsible for secondary BSI.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Sternoclavicular septic {{arthritis}} {{is a rare}} condition and accounts only for 1 % of cases of {{septic arthritis}} in the general population. The most common risk factors are intravenous drug use, <b>central-line</b> infection, distant-site infection, immunosuppression, trauma and diabetes mellitus. This is a report of an unusual case where this type of arthritis was masquerading as rupture of the cervical oesophagus. Case presentation A 63 -year-old man presented complaining of right neck pain and dysphagia following a bout of violent coughing. Physical examination revealed cellulitis extending from the right sternoclidomastoid region to the anterior upper chest. Computed tomography showed inflammatory changes behind the right sternoclavicular joint with mediastinitis and ipsilateral pleural effusion. These findings raised the suspicion of spontaneous rupture of the cervical oesophagus. Management involved jejunal feeding along with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The inflammation, however, relapsed after discontinuation of the antibiotics and this time, computed tomography pointed to a diagnosis of arthritis of the sternoclavicular joint. The patient responded completely to a 6 -week course of oral penicillin, flucloxacillin and metronidazole. Conclusion Sternoclavicular arthritis is a rare condition that {{has been associated with}} a variety of predisposing factors.

Objective: To estimate the healthy life-years (HLYs) lost due to 6 incidents in English hospitals between the years 2005 / 2006 and 2009 / 2010, to compare burden across incidents, and estimate excess bed-days. Research Design: The study used cross-sectional analysis of the medical records of all inpatients treated in 273 English hospitals. Patients with 6 types of preventable incidents were identified. Total attributable loss of HLYs was estimated through propensity score matching by considering the hypothetical remaining length {{and quality of life}} had the incident not occurred. Results: The 6 incidents resulted in an annual loss of 68 HLYs and 934 excess bed-days per 100, 000 population. Preventable pressure ulcers caused the loss of 26 HLYs and 555 excess bed-days annually. Deaths in low-mortality procedures resulted in 25 lost life-years and 42 bed-days. Deep-vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolisms cost 12 HLYs, and 240 bed-days. Postoperative sepsis, hip fractures, and <b>central-line</b> infections cost < 6 HLYs and 100 bed-days each.

Hospital average length of stay is usually 5 - 10 days higher in these patients. In HIV positive/Aids patients HAI vary from 8, 7 and 15 % in prevalence. The aims {{of this study was}} to compare HAI data from HIV positive (HIV+) and HIV negative (HIV-) patients admitted to the adult Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of an Infectious Disease reference hospital located in the state of Ceara, Northeast Brazil. Approach: This was a retrospective study of all patients admitted to the Hospital Sao Jose ICU, from January 2006 to December 2007, which were diagnosed with a HAI. Results: During the study period, 144 cases of HAI were diagnosed in 106 patients. Sixty were HIV- and 46 HIV+. Eighty nine (62 %) HAI occurred in the HIV-group. The use of invasive devices, such as mechanical ventilation, <b>central-line</b> catheter and vesicle catheter, was identified in 114 HAI. Pneumonia was the most prevalent HAI (83 / 144 - 80 %), almost all of them related to mechanical ventilation (81 / 83 - 96 %).

40|$|Background: The {{last two}} decades have seen an {{unprecedented}} growth in initiatives aimed to improve patient safety. For the most part, however, evidence of their impact remains controversial. At the same time, the healthcare industry has experienced an also unprecedented growth in the amount and variety of available electronic data. Methods: In this paper, we provide {{a review of the}} use of routinely collected electronic data in the identification, analysis and surveillance of temporal patterns of patient safety. Results: Two important temporal patterns of the safety of hospitalised patients were identified and discussed: long-term trends related to changes in clinical practice and healthcare policy; and shorter term patterns related to variations in workforce and resources. We found that consistency in reporting is intrinsically related to availability of large-scale, fit-for-purpose data. Consistent reported trends of patient harms included an increase in the incidence of post-operative sepsis and a decrease in <b>central-line</b> associated bloodstream infections. Improvement in the treatment of specific diseases, such as cardiac conditions, has also been demonstrated. Linkage of hospital data with other datasets provides essential temporal information about errors, as well as information about unsuspected system deficiencies. It has {{played an important role in}} the measurement and analysis of the effects of off-hours hospital operation. Conclusions: Measuring temporal patterns of patient safety is still inadequate with electronic health records not yet playing an important role. Patient safety interventions should not be implemented without a strategy for continuous monitoring of their effect. 10 page(s...|$|E

One hundred and five (87. 5 %) completed the training, 5 (4. 1 %) withdrew after the first session, and 10 (8. 3 %) withdrew during practical sessions. After educational intervention, the overall CLABSI rate was reduced by 46 % (from 6. 86 to 3. 70 / 1000 CL-days). CLABSI rate was lower in children whose caregivers completed the training (1. 74 / 1000 CL-days, 95 % CI 0. 43 - 6. 94) compared with those who did not receive any training (12. 2 / 1000 CL-days, 95 % CI 7. 08 - 21. 0, P <  0. 05) or were in-training (3. 96 / 1000 CL-days, 95 % CI 1. 98 - 7. 91) at the time of infection. Caregiver training in CL management, applied within a multifaceted QI approach, reduced the rate of CLABSI in children with acute leukemia. Specific training and active involvement of caregivers in CL management may be effective to reduce CLABSI in high-risk children...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{number of}} {{antimicrobial}} impregnated discs to prevent <b>central-line</b> associated {{blood stream infection}} (CLABSI) are marketed but it is unclear which disc is most effective. Aim: To investigate the feasibility and safety of comparing two antimicrobial impregnated discs to prevent CLABSI. Methods: We conducted a single-centre, parallel group, randomised controlled trial in a 929 -bed, tertiary referral hospital. Hospital in-patients requiring a peripherally inserted central catheter were randomised to chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) or polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) disc dressing group. Dressings were replaced every 7 -days, or earlier, if clinically required. Participants were followed until device removal or hospital discharge. Feasibility outcomes included: proportion of potentially eligible participants who were enrolled; proportion of protocol violations; and proportion of patients lost to follow-up. Clinical outcomes were: CLABSI incidence, diagnosed by a blinded infection control practitioner; all cause BSI; and product-related adverse events. Findings: Of 143 patients screened, 101 (42 %) were eligible. Five (3. 5 %) declined participation. There was one post-randomisation exclusion. Two (2 %) protocol violations occurred in the CHG group. No patients were lost to follow-up. Three (3 %) blood stream infections occurred; two (2 %) were confirmed CLABSIs (one in each group) and one a mucosal barrier injury-related BSI. 1217 device days were studied; resulting in 1. 64 CLABSI/ 1000 catheter days. One (1 %) disc-related adverse events occurred in the CHG group. Conclusion: Disc dressings containg PHMB are safe to use for infection prevention at catheter insertion sites. An adequately powered trial to compare PHMB and CHG discs is feasible...|$|E
40|$|Candidemia is an {{important}} cause of mortality in healthcare settings. Peripheral lines {{are a source of}} candidemia, yet few studies have reported on the clinico-epidemiological features of candidemia due to peripheral-line associated blood stream infection (PLABSI). We conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study of all patients with candidemia between 2002 and 2013. PLABSI was defined as the presence of {{at least one of the}} following: the presence of phlebitis or the resolution of clinical symptoms after peripheral-line withdrawal, with careful exclusion of an alternative explanation for bacteraemia. We described the epidemiology of candidemia and assessed predictive factors of PLABSI due to Candida spp., peripheral line-associated candidemia (PLAC), compared with non-PLAC. A total of 301 episodes of candidemia, including 37 of PLAC, were diagnosed during the study period. <b>Central-line</b> associated blood stream infection, intra-abdominal infection, and infection of unknown source accounted for the remaining 233, 14, and 17 cases, respectively. The overall incidence rate of candidemia was 0. 11 / 1000 patient-days. In multivariate analysis, cephalosporin exposure (odds ratio [OR] = 2. 22, 95 % CI 1. 04 - 4. 77), polymicrobial bacteraemia/fungaemia (OR = 2. 87, 95 % CI 1. 02 - 8. 10), and ID specialist consultation (OR = 2. 40, 95 % CI 1. 13 - 5. 13) were identified as independent predictors of PLAC. Although non-PLAC had a higher mortality, the length of hospital stay after candidemia was similar between the two groups and candidemia duration was longer in the PLAC group. PLACs are {{an important}} cause of candidemia in hospitalized patients. Appropriate identification and management of PLAC are crucial...|$|E
40|$|The current {{field of}} {{research}} concerning the impact of railroads in Sweden beside from the State main-line network is relatively narrow. Including cultural impact to the area narrows the results even further. The {{purpose of this study}} is to open the field even more into the local societies and to what extent the impact of the introduction of railroad might have had on smaller county villages. Sweden holds a unique position concerning “station towns” or “railways towns” in terms of railway policy and the industrial development in towns that were affected by the railway, as the affected towns continued development were based on a hybrid between direct democracy and adaptations of city-law policies. This study takes place in Kisa, a small town in southern Östergötland that during the beginning of the 20 th century turned into a municipal community due to the building of Östra centralbanan (roughly translated Eastern <b>central-line).</b> The aim has been to apply and compare earlier results concerning station towns in general research with local research on the town of Kisa. The tools for investigating the impact of the railroad in Kisa include demographical, industrial and criminal development of the town. Local letters sent to the district moot, in Swedish termed as kommunalstämma, as well as an insight to the local newspaper are also presented in this study. The conclusions of this study approves in many forms to the results of earlier research, but also opens questions for further research regarding the interacting relationship between sociology, voluntary sector and cultural differences in the early industrial station towns...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) can colonize {{or cause}} infections in high-risk {{patients}} and contaminate the environment. Our {{objective was to}} describe the epidemiological investigation of an outbreak of VRE, the interventions made, {{and their impact on}} its control. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, descriptive, non-comparative study by reviewing the charts of patients with a VRE-positive culture in the University Hospital of Campinas State University, comprising 380 beds, 40 of which were in intensive care units (ICUs), who were admitted from February 2008 -January 2009. Interventions were divided into educational activity, reviewing the workflow processes, engineering measures, and administrative procedures. Results: There were 150 patients, 139 (92. 7 %) colonized and 11 (7. 3 %) infected. Seventy-three percent were cared for in non-ICUs (p = 0. 028). Infection was more frequent in patients with a <b>central-line</b> (p = 0. 043), mechanical ventilation (p = 0. 013), urinary catheter (p = 0. 049), or surgical drain (p = 0. 049). Vancomycin, metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and third-generation cephalosporin were previously used by 47 (31. 3 %), 31 (20. 7 %), 24 (16 %), and 24 (16 %) patients, respectively. Death was more frequent in infected (73 %) than in colonized (17 %) patients (p < 0. 001). After the interventions, the attack rate fell from 1. 49 to 0. 33 (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Classical risk factors for VRE colonization or infection, e. g., being cared for in an ICU and previous use of vancomycin, were not found in this study. The conjunction of an educational program, strict adhesion to contact precautions, and reinforcement of environmental cleaning were able to prevent the dissemination of VRE...|$|E
