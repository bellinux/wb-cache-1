50|$|In February 2009, OMTP {{expanded}} its Local Connectivity specification (based on micro-USB) to describe requirements for a <b>common</b> <b>charger</b> and common connector to enable {{sharing the same}} battery charger through different phones. The OMTP Common Charging and Local Data Connectivity was adopted by GSM Association in the Universal Charging System (UCS) initiative. This has been further endorsed by the CTIA and the ITU. In June, 2009 the European Commission reached an agreement with several major mobile phone providers on requirements for a common External Power Supply (EPS) to be compatible with new data-enabled phones sold in the European Union. The EPS shares most of the key attributes of the UCS charger.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2013 {{amendment}} to a [...] "Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament … {{relating to the}} making available on the market of radio equipment", the European Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection included a recommendation for [...] "... A renewed effort to develop a <b>common</b> <b>charger</b> ... being highly desirable and consequently ... beneficial in particular for consumers and other end-users." [...] The parliamentary proposal applies to all radio equipment (any [...] "product which intentionally emits or receives radio waves for communication") including mobile phones, tablet computers, car door openers, modems, etc. Yet, the draft law, approved overwhelmingly by the European Parliament on 13 March 2014, stipulates {{that it will be}} up to the European Commission to decide which specific types of radio equipment will have to be compatible with common chargers. [...] Once formally approved by the Council of Ministers, member states will have two years to transpose the new regulations into national laws and manufacturers will have an additional year after that to comply.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{provisions}} of the Commission Regulation no. 1794 / 2006 of 6 December 2006 laying down a <b>common</b> <b>charging</b> scheme for air navigation services. In the European Commission’s opinion the development of a <b>common</b> <b>charging</b> scheme for air navigation services provided during all phases of flight is important for the implementation of the Single European Sky. This scheme should be based on common harmonized rules and should improve economic efficiency. Three are the main principles of the charging scheme: remuneration, transparency and no discrimination. The analysis of the most significant provisions of the Regulation no. 1794 / 2006 (mechanism for calculating cost and charges of air navigation services, exemption of some type of services from air navigation charges, incentives) shows that the objectives have not been fully achieved. In fact, since the publication of this paper, the Regulation has been substantially modified...|$|R

40|$|In {{a chapter}} {{entitled}} “Of Identity and Diversity ” (Essay II. xxvii) {{written for the}} second edition of An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, John Locke presents his account of personal identity. It is surely the most famous treatment of that topic {{in the history of}} Western philosophy. 1 But while it often draws high marks for originality, it has also been criticized as circular and inconsistent. A <b>common</b> <b>charge</b> of circularity, datable at least to Joseph Butler (1736), is that Locke’s attempt to analyze personal identity in terms of memory fails because memory itself presupposes personal identity. One <b>common</b> <b>charge</b> of inconsistency, datable at least to George Berkeley (1732) and Thomas Reid (1785), is that Locke’s theory of personal identity leads, through the transitivity of identity, to contradictory consequences. A second <b>common</b> <b>charge</b> of inconsistency, however, concerns Section 13 of the chapter, in which Locke considers the possibility of a “transfer of consciousness ” in which “one intellectual Substance ” would “have represented to it, as done by it self, what it never did, and was perhaps done by some other Agent. ” Locke describes such a transfer of consciousness as involving “a fatal Error ” that would “draw Reward and Punishment with it, ” and he claims that God’s goodness could be expected to prevent the occurrence of such transfers if they were otherwise possible in the nature of things. It has seemed to many commentators that this section—which I will call “the Fatal Error Passage”—is utterl...|$|R
