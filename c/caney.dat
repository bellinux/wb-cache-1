5|$|US-60 next {{comes to}} a {{junction}} with SH-123 as it enters Bartlesville. The SH-123 junction lies a few feet into Washington County; south of the junction, US-60 and SH-123 form a concurrency, and the two routes curve slightly {{to the west and}} straddle the Washington–Osage county line. After only , US-60 turns to the east along Adams Boulevard, splitting away from SH-123, and fully enters Washington County. US-60 runs through downtown Bartlesville on Adams, then bridges the <b>Caney</b> River. The highway continues to an interchange with US-75. At this interchange, US-60 turns south and overlaps US-75 before splitting off to the east once again, leaving Bartlesville and, soon, Washington County behind.|$|E

25|$|Often, {{the general}} {{population}} lived in large circular buildings (bohios), constructed with wooden poles, woven straw, and palm leaves. These houses, built surrounding the central plaza, could hold 10-15 families each. The cacique and his family lived in rectangular buildings (<b>caney)</b> of similar construction, with wooden porches. Taíno home furnishings included cotton hammocks (hamaca), sleeping and sitting mats made of palms, wooden chairs (dujo or duho) with woven seats, platforms, and cradles for children.|$|E

During the Spanish–American War he fought with the 5th Army Corps in Cuba, and received the Silver Star for gallantry at the Battle of El <b>Caney.</b> From 1899 to 1902, {{he served in the}} Philippines during the insurrection and subsequently, after teaching law at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, participated in the Moro Expedition in the Philippines in 1905–1906. Bundy served within the United States until 1917, where he commanded a regiment on the United States–Mexico border.|$|E
25|$|Louisiana was {{inhabited}} by Native Americans for many millennia {{before the arrival}} of Europeans in the 16th century. During the Middle Archaic period, Louisiana was the site of the earliest mound complex in North America and one of the earliest dated, complex constructions in the Americas, the Watson Brake site near present-day Monroe. An 11-mound complex, it was built about 5400 BP (3500 BCE). The Middle Archaic sites of <b>Caney</b> and Frenchman's Bend have also been securely dated to 5600–5000 BP, demonstrating that seasonal hunter-gatherers organized to build complex constructions in present-day northern Louisiana. The Hedgepeth Site in Lincoln Parish is more recent, dated to 5200–4500 BP.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} at Sevilla, briefly occupied by American forces, {{turned out to}} be of little value for the aimed advance towards Santiago. General Shafter considered installing his headquarters at La Redonda once the landing was completed, moving it afterwards to El Pozo. The Spanish retreat did unbar the way to the strong points that covered Santiago on the east side, mainly Fort Aguadores, San Juan Hill, Canosa, El <b>Caney,</b> and Fort El Viso, where a set of bloody battles would be waged on July 1. Many of the Spanish officers and soldiers that fought at Las Guasimas de Sevilla were to be in the fight again at the bloody encounter of San Juan Hill.|$|E
25|$|The first {{settlement}} in the area was known as Floyd's Lane which was on a trail that ran from a Colorado River crossing on the west to a San Bernard River crossing on the east. A trail that ran beside <b>Caney</b> Creek connected the area to Wharton. Boling was founded in 1900 when the New York, Texas & Mexican Railroad built a line through the area. The settlement was named for Mary Bolling Vineyard, the then-6-year-old daughter of Robert E. Vineyard who had the town surveyed. By 1907 the town had a school, a store, a blacksmith shop, and about ten families. The school had four teachers and 104 black students. These children descended from the African-American slaves who worked the area's plantations in the pre-Civil War era. Their parents were sharecroppers or hired hands on the large land tracts which survived from the earlier time.|$|E
25|$|On 25 December 1894, three ships, the Lagonda, the Almadis and the Baracoa, {{set sail}} for Cuba from Fernandina Beach, Florida, loaded with armed men and supplies. Two {{of the ships}} were seized by U.S. {{authorities}} in early January, who also alerted the Spanish government, but the proceedings went ahead. The insurrection began on 24 February 1895, with uprisings all across the island. In Oriente the most important ones took place in Santiago, Guantánamo, Jiguaní, San Luis, El Cobre, El <b>Caney,</b> Alto Songo, Bayate and Baire. The uprisings in {{the central part of}} the island, such as Ibarra, Jagüey Grande and Aguada, suffered from poor co-ordination and failed; the leaders were captured, some of them deported and some executed. In the province of Havana the insurrection was discovered before it got off and the leaders detained. Thus, the insurgents further west in Pinar del Río were ordered to wait.|$|E
25|$|With Guantánamo Bay {{successfully}} occupied, US interest {{centered on}} operations at Santiago. An American expeditionary force of 17,000 officers and men under Major General William R. Shafter was landed {{east of the}} city at the small ports of Daiquirí and Siboney between 22 and 25 June, without opposition. A week later, on 1 July, the historic battles of El <b>Caney</b> and San Juan Hill ended in victory for U.S. forces, opening up the approaches to Santiago itself. On the morning of 3 July, a demand {{was sent to the}} Spanish commander, General Arsenio Linares, to surrender or suffer bombardment of the city as an alternative. On the same morning, the Spanish fleet under Admiral Pascual Cervera sallied forth from Santiago Bay, only to meet with complete destruction {{at the hands of the}} U.S. fleet. Major Spanish resistance at Santiago was at an end, although it was not until 15 July that a preliminary agreement was signed. U.S. forces occupied the city on 17 July.|$|E
25|$|Resistance in Santiago {{consolidated}} around Fort Canosa, while major {{battles between}} Spaniards and Americans {{took place at}} Las Guasimas on June 24, and at El <b>Caney</b> and San Juan Hill on 1 July, after which the American advance ground to a halt. Spanish troops successfully defended Fort Canosa, allowing them to stabilize their line and bar the entry to Santiago. The Americans and Cubans began a brutal siege of the city, which surrendered on July 16 after {{the defeat of the}} Spanish Caribbean Squadron. Thus, Oriente fell under the control of Americans and the Cubans, but U.S. General Nelson A. Miles would not allow Cuban troops to enter Santiago, claiming that he wanted to prevent clashes between Cubans and Spaniards. Thus, Cuban General Calixto García, head of the mambi forces in the Eastern department, ordered his troops to hold their respective areas and resigned, writing a letter of protest to General Shafter.|$|E
25|$|After the Spanish–American War {{began in}} April 1898, Allen left from his {{position}} in Germany and by June 1898 was placed in command of Troop D of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment. He then became a major of volunteers and was ordered off to Cuba. He and the volunteers served as scouts and on escort duty during the Santiago Land Campaign. They also fought on July 1, 1898, in the Battle of El <b>Caney.</b> On July 10, Allen {{took control of the}} town and its camp containing over 20,000 refugees. Though there was not adequate food nor medicine, a disaster was averted when Santiago de Cuba surrendered only six days later, allowing the refugees to return to their homes. Allen then developed a case of malaria or yellow fever and {{had to go back to}} the United States to recover. His service in the war made him highly regarded by Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt would later try to make Allen part of a planned division of volunteers during World War I, but the division was never formed.|$|E
25|$|Hostilities started {{hours after}} the {{declaration}} of war when a U.S. contingent under Admiral William T. Sampson blockaded several Cuban ports. The Americans decided to invade Cuba and to start in Oriente where the Cubans had almost absolute control {{and were able to}} co-operate, for example, by establishing a beachhead and protecting the U.S. landing in Daiquiri. The first U.S. objective was to capture the city of Santiago de Cuba in order to destroy Linares' army and Cervera's fleet. To reach Santiago they had to pass through concentrated Spanish defences in the San Juan Hills and a small town in El <b>Caney.</b> Between 22 and 24 June 1898 the Americans landed under General William R. Shafter at Daiquirí and Siboney, east of Santiago, and established a base. The port of Santiago became the main target of U.S. naval operations, and the American fleet attacking Santiago needed shelter from the summer hurricane season. Nearby Guantánamo Bay, with its excellent harbour, was chosen for this purpose and attacked on 6 June. The Battle of Santiago de Cuba, on 3 July 1898, was the largest naval engagement during the Spanish–American War, and resulted in the destruction of the Spanish Caribbean Squadron.|$|E

2500|$|The {{history of}} the <b>Caney</b> Fork {{from the end of}} the Civil War to the {{beginning}} of the 1920s tells the story of entrepreneur after entrepreneur attempting to harness the <b>Caney</b> Fork's alluring power potential only to be defeated by the river's volatile flash-flood tendencies.
