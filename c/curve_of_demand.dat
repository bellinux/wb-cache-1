According to its nature, the market economy is unstable and is in constant movement. Economy has an effective instrument for explanation of changes in economic environment; this tool is called the modelling of economic processes. The modelling of economic processes depends first and foremost on the building of economic model which is the base for the formalization of economic process, that is, the building of mathematical model. The effective means for formalization of economic process {{is the creation of}} the model of hypothetic or imaginary economy. The building <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> model is significant for the market of goods and services. The problem includes the receiving (as the result of modelling) definite functional properties <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> manufacturing feasibilities and demand according to which one can determine their mathematical model. Another problem lies in obtaining majorant properties <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> joint <b>demand</b> on the market of goods and services. Analysis of the latest researches and publications.

40|$|The new {{paradigms}} and {{latest developments}} in the Electrical Grid {{are based on the}} introduction of distributed intelligence at several stages of its physical layer, giving birth to concepts such as Smart Grids, Virtual Power Plants, microgrids, Smart Buildings and Smart Environments. Distributed Generation (DG) is a philosophy in which energy is no longer produced exclusively in huge centralized plants, but also in smaller premises which take advantage of local conditions in order to minimize transmission losses and optimize production and consumption. This represents a new opportunity for renewable energy, because small elements such as solar panels and wind turbines are expected to be scattered along the grid, feeding local installations or selling energy to the grid depending on their local generation/consumption conditions. The introduction of these highly dynamic elements will lead to a substantial change in the <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>demanded</b> energy. The aim {{of this paper is to}} apply Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF) in microgrid environments with curves and similar behaviours, using two different data sets: the first one packing electricity consumption information during four years and six months in a microgrid along with calendar data, while the second one will be just four months of the previous parameters along with the solar radiation from the site. For the first set of data different STLF models will be discussed, studying the effect of each variable, in order to identify the best one. That model will be employed with the second set of data, in order to make a comparison with a new model that takes into account the solar radiation, since the photovoltaic installations of the microgrid will cause the power demand to fluctuate depending on the solar radiation...|$|R

However, demand is the willingness and ability of a consumer to purchase a good under the prevailing circumstances; so, any circumstance that affects the consumer's willingness or ability to buy the good or service in question can be a non-price determinant <b>of</b> <b>demand.</b> As an example, weather could be a factor in the demand for beer at a baseball game.|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} the author justifies the {{necessity}} of creating a General theory of utility and value as categories of the value individual economic behaviour. They are constructed {{on the basis of}} the economics, and therefore, any comprehensive and fundamental economic exposition should be based on them. Together with the known in the literature theories of value and marginal utility, introduced and justified are notions of value and marginal utility (which at the individual level are subjective value and subjective marginal utility). A theory of the marginal value could not have, for the economic science, a lesser meaning than the theory of marginal utility (constructed by the Austrian subjective school). The creation of a relative theory of utility and value is suggested, in which the relative utility and value are comparable with each other and allow the analysis of the value economic behaviour of the individual. With the help of those relative categories it is possible to construct categories of added utility, added value and added product (as well as marginal added utility, marginal added value and marginal added product), which are totally compatible with the contemporary economics, deriving also the individual <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> product’s <b>demand</b> and supply, and the individual supply of labour. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{manufacturer}} wholesaling to {{a retailer}} a 'newsvendor-type' product {{such as a}} seasonal/fashion good or a perishable food item is considered here. It is known that such a manufacturer/retailer channel has difficulties in fully realizing the market's profit potential. We study a theoretical construct of such a channel and present practically useful results for a manufacturer trying to design more profitable pricing schemes. Specifically, we consider a 'dominant' manufacturer supplying a newsvendor-type product to a retailer. The retail market volume varies with the unit retail price according to a stochastic demand curve. We study the design and performance of 'price-only', 'buyback' and 'manufacturer-imposed retail price' schemes. All these schemes have been considered in earlier works. The {{first part of this}} paper studies some important but previously overlooked aspects of price-only and buyback schemes. We show that the performance of these schemes is strongly and somewhat counter-intuitively affected by the specific form <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> <b>curve</b> and <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> randomization. Thus, we identify hitherto neglected factors that must be carefully considered when designing pricing schemes for actual implementation. The second part of this paper demonstrates the practicality and merit of using buyback in conjunction with a manufacturer-imposed retail price - an arrangement overlooked in the literature because it is widely mistaken as illegal. Overall, the paper shows how a manufacturer can better realize the market's potential by: (i) modifying slightly the well-known buyback arrangement; and (ii) carefully modelling certain hitherto neglected aspects of the price/demand relationship - a conclusion quite contrary to what one might surmise from the current theoretical literature. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|In economics, a {{complementary}} good or complement {{is a good}} with a negative cross elasticity <b>of</b> <b>demand,</b> {{in contrast to a}} substitute good. This means a good's demand is increased when the price of another good is decreased. Conversely, the demand for a good is decreased when the price of another good is increased. If goods A and B are complements, an increase in the price of A will result in a leftward movement along the <b>demand</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> A and cause the demand curve for B to shift in; less of each good will be demanded. A decrease in price of A will result in a rightward movement along the <b>demand</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> A and cause the demand curve B to shift outward; more of each good will be demanded. Basically this means that since the <b>demand</b> <b>of</b> one good is linked to the <b>demand</b> <b>of</b> another good, if a higher quantity is <b>demanded</b> <b>of</b> one good, a higher quantity will also be <b>demanded</b> <b>of</b> the other, and if a lower quantity is <b>demanded</b> <b>of</b> one good, a lower quantity will be <b>demanded</b> <b>of</b> the other.

With substitute goods, however, the price and quantity <b>demanded</b> <b>of</b> one good is related inversely to the price and quantity <b>demanded</b> <b>of</b> a substitute good, meaning that if the price or quantity <b>demanded</b> <b>of</b> one good rises, the price or quantity <b>demanded</b> <b>of</b> its substitute will fall.|$|R

In the small scale range, where CHP can be particularly promising to match local heat and power demand, the technologies based on boilers coupled to steam turbines (ST) and bottoming Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) can be operated in flexible mode to match the energy demand. This is particularly important when high temperature heat is required (i. e. industrial end users). In the case of solid biomass fired CHP, the boiler + ST/ORC option could be competitive with the alternatives of boiler + Stirling engine, externally fired GT or gasification + ICE. In this paper, a thermo-economic comparison of the following biomass-CHP configurations is proposed: (A) boiler + ST + bottoming ORC, (B) boiler + ST, (C) boiler + ORC and (D) configuration (A) with option to switch on or off the bottoming ORC on the basis <b>of</b> the heat <b>demand</b> available. The focus is on a 1 MWt biomass boiler, and the plants are operated to serve residential (r), tertiary (t) and industrial (i) heat and power demand. The thermodynamic cycles are modeled by Cycle-Tempo, while the energy demand is modeled through simplified indicators (temperature <b>of</b> heat <b>demand,</b> equivalent thermal demand hours). On the basis of the results of thermodynamic simulations, upfront and operational costs assessment, and Italian energy policy scenario (feed-in tariffs for biomass electricity), the global energy conversion efficiency and investment profitability is estimated, for each CHP configuration and energy demand segment. The results indicate the optimal CHP configuration for each end user and the key technical and economic factors in the Italian legislative framework...|$|R
