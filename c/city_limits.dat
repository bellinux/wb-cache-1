5|$|By 2000, {{the city}} of Sacramento {{maintained}} the non-freeway portion of SR 160 within the <b>city</b> <b>limits</b> under a contract with Caltrans. However, since Caltrans's main goal is to move traffic efficiently, the city {{was not able to}} carry out pedestrian-friendly projects that they and local residents wanted. Under a law passed in July 1999, Caltrans was authorized to relinquish any part of Route 160 within the <b>city</b> <b>limits</b> to Sacramento. The two agencies agreed, and on October 19, 2000 the portion from the south <b>city</b> <b>limits</b> to the American River became the full responsibility of the city. A 2003 amendment to the Streets and Highways Code erroneously deleted not only this part, but the North Sacramento Freeway as well.|$|E

50|$|A <b>city's</b> <b>limit</b> may extend {{into more}} than one county, which can complicate certain matters of {{policing}} and taxation.

Where a city merges its government with that of its county to become a consolidated city-county, the <b>city</b> <b>limit</b> is usually considered to be expanded to occupy all of the previously-unincorporated area of the county, while other existing municipalities continue to exist but are permanently locked into their <b>city's</b> <b>limit</b> without the possibility of annexation (except possibly into a neighboring county). An independent <b>city's</b> <b>limit</b> separates it from being in any county at all. Similarly, cities and towns may or may not be considered part of the townships they are in.|$|R
