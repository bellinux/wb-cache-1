50|$|Early {{crossbar}} exchanges {{were divided}} into an originating side and a terminating side, while the later and prominent Canadian and US SP1 switch and 5XB switch were not. When a user picked up the telephone handset, the resulting line loop operating the user's line relay caused the exchange to connect the user's telephone to an originating sender, which returned the user a dial tone. The sender then recorded the dialed digits and passed them to the originating marker, which selected an outgoing trunk and operated the various crossbar switch stages to connect the <b>calling</b> <b>user</b> to it. The originating marker then passed the trunk call completion requirements (type of pulsing, resistance of the trunk, etc.) and the called party's details to the sender and released. The sender then relayed this information to a terminating sender (which could be on either the same or a different exchange). This sender then used a terminating marker to connect the <b>calling</b> <b>user,</b> via the selected incoming trunk, to the called user, and caused the controlling relay set to pass intermittent ring voltage of about 90 V AC at 20 Hz to ring the called user's phone bell, and return ringing tone to the caller.|$|E
50|$|P-Called-Party-ID: The URI {{originally}} {{indicated in}} the request-URI of a request generated by the <b>calling</b> <b>user</b> agent. When the request reaches the registrar (S-CSCF) of the called user, the registrar re-writes the request-URI on {{the first line of}} the request with the registered contact address (i.e. IP address) of the called user, and stores the replaced request-URI in this header field. In the IMS, a user may be identified by several SIP URIs (address-of-record), for instance, a SIP URI for work and another SIP URI for personal use, and when the registrar replaces the request-URI with the effective contact address, the original request-URI must be stored so that the called party knows to which address-of-record was the invitation sent.|$|E

40|$|The {{combination}} of position fixing mechanisms with location-dependent, geographical information, can offer truly customized personal communication services through the mobile phone or {{other type of}} devices. Prompted by the avalanche of technology advances in the aforementioned areas {{in this paper we}} present a generic framework for delivering Location Based Services (LBS). The framework is capable of providing the full functionality required for delivering LBS, starting from the specification of the service, covering issues like the deployment and maintenance of services, the service invocation and the final delivery of the produced results to the <b>calling</b> <b>user.</b> The main focus of the paper is on the technical specification, the design and the functionality of the framework. However, with the purpose of assessing the proposed architecture, a prototype implementation based on the discussed specifications was built and its performance was evaluated using a series of pilot services. ...|$|E
40|$|Wireless {{communications}} and IP networks will {{evolve into a}} new converged vision, which is called "beyond the third generation," where charging and billing will be essential tools for customer care to fight competition and to assure operator's revenue. This contribution proposes a business model for video-call billing founded on Bayes' decision testing. It {{is based on the}} end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) estimated by exploiting the tracing watermarking procedure, which has recently been introduced into the literature. In particular, we employ the watermark embedded in each transmitted video sequence to monitor the QoS of the communication link and adequately charge the <b>calling</b> <b>user,</b> depending on the received video quality. Adopting such a Bayesian business model, we translate the network operator's paradigm of "pay as you talk (and watch) " to "pay how you talk (and watch)," maximizing the operator's profit under a constrained video quality for end users. Wide simulation trials are conducted to characterize the effectiveness of the proposed method, using different business scenarios, confirming the validity of such an approach...|$|E

40|$|In 3 GPP networks, the {{signaling}} path between a <b>calling</b> <b>user</b> and a called user can be partitioned into segments, {{referred to as}} traffic legs. Each traffic leg may span networks belonging to different operators and will have its own characteristics that can be different from other traffic legs in the same call. A traffic leg might be associated with multiple SIP dialogs, e. g., in case a Back-to-Back User Agent (B 2 BUA) that modifies the SIP dialog identifier is located within the traffic leg. This document defines a new SIP URI parameter, ’iotl ’ (an abbreviation for Inter-Operator Traffic Leg). The parameter {{can be used in}} a SIP URI to indicate that the entity associated with the address, or an entity responsible for the host part of the address, represents the end of a specific traffic leg (or multiple traffic legs). The SIP URI ’iotl ’ parameter defined in this document has known uses in 3 GPP networks. Usage in other networks is also possible. Status of This Memo This is an Internet Standards Track document.

30|$|Another {{limitation}} {{is related to}} the data used for the experiment. Although many studies have shown that mobile phone data provide a good proxy for human mobility studies [16], potential sources of inaccuracy do certainly exist. The first major concern, as only the mobile phone users are included in the data set, is a possible bias related to the specificity of the sample taken into consideration. The very large number of customers involved in this study (35 % of the whole population) seems to go against this specificity bias, even if there might be some bias related {{to the fact that we}} consider a single operator in this study. Other authors have proposed different models of human mobility patterns (see for example [48]): Although the goal of this work is methodological, i.e., to propose a comparison of modeling different mitigation strategies considering the same underlying mobility model extracted from the CDRs, it would be interesting to investigate how different mobility models might affect our final results in terms of countermeasures? effectiveness. This is an issue that we plan to address in a future work. There might also be a positive correlation between user mobility and communication frequency [49]: as billing records collect location only when a communication event occurs, a frequently moving (and <b>calling)</b> <b>user</b> has more location points than a more static one. So the movements of low-mobility users can be underestimated. However, it has been shown that in particular CDRs reproduce long-distance travel patterns with a high accuracy especially compared to transportation surveys [50]. For this reason, our research, founded on sub-prefecture flows, is probably less affected by this bias.|$|E
