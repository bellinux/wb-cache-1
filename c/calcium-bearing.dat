5000|$|The cement {{is made by}} fusing {{together}} a mixture of a <b>calcium-bearing</b> material (normally calcium oxide from limestone) and an aluminium-bearing material (normally bauxite for general purposes, or refined alumina for white and refractory cements). The liquified mixture cools to a vesicular, basalt-like clinker which is ground alone to produce the finished product. Because complete melting usually takes place, raw materials in lump-form can be used. A typical kiln arrangement comprises a reverberatory furnace provided with a shaft preheater in which the hot exhaust gases pass upward as the lump raw material mix passes downward. The preheater recuperates most of the heat in the combustion gases, dehydrates and de-hydroxylates the bauxite and de-carbonates the limestone. The calcined material drops into the [...] "cool end" [...] of the melt bath. The melt overflows the hot end of the furnace into molds in which it cools and solidifies. The system is fired with pulverized coal or oil. The cooled clinker ingots are crushed and ground in a ball-mill.

One potentially long-term solution for offsetting these emissions is the capture and storage of carbon dioxide. In principle, fluid or gaseous carbon dioxide can be injected into the Earth's crust and locked up as carbonate minerals through chemical reactions with calcium and magnesium ions supplied by silicate minerals.

In this paper, the pure C-S-H phases (Ca/Si ratio: 0. 66 to 2. 0) were synthesized and used for the accelerated carbonation test. Synthesized C-S-H phases with different Ca/Si ratio were identified by X-ray diffraction and 29 Si nuclear magnetic resonance.

40|$|The {{interactions}} of trivalent lanthanides and actinides with secondary mineral phases such as calcite is of high {{importance for the}} safety assessment of deep geological repositories for high level nuclear waste (HLW). Due to similar ionic radii, <b>calcium-bearing</b> mineral phases are suitable host minerals for Ln(III) and An(III) ions. Especially calcite has been proven to retain these metal ions effectively by both surface complexation and bulk incorporation. Since anionic ligands (e. g., nitrate) are omnipresent in the geological environment and due to their coordinating properties, their influence on retentive processes should not be underestimated. Nitrate is a common contaminant in most HLW forms {{as a result of}} using nitric acid in fuel reprocessing. It is also formed by microbial activity under aerobic conditions. In this study, atomic force microscopy investigations revealed a major influence of nitrate upon the surface of calcite crystals. NaNO 3 causes serious modifications even in trace amounts (< 10 − 7 M) and forms a soft surface layer of low crystallinity on top of the calcite crystal. Time-resolved laser fluorescence spectroscopy of Eu(III) showed that, within this layer, Eu(III) ions are incorporated, while losing most of their hydration shell.

We {{show that this}} pattern {{can be explained by}} impact vaporization from interplanetary dust with variations being due to Mercury's radial and vertical excursions through an interplanetary dust disk having an inclination within 5 degrees of the plane of Mercury's orbit. Both a highly inclined dust disk and a two-disk model (where the two disks have a mutual inclination) fail to reproduce the observed variation in calcium exospheric abundance with Mercury true anomaly angle. However, an additional source of impacting dust beyond the nominal dust disk is required near Mercury's true anomaly () 25 deg +/- 5 deg. This is close to but not coincident with Mercury's true anomaly (= 45 deg) when it crosses comet 2 P/Encke's present day orbital plane. Interestingly, the Taurid meteor storms at Earth, which are also due to Comet Encke, are observed to occur when Earth's true anomaly is +/- 20 or so degrees before and after the position where Earth and Encke orbital planes cross. The lack of exact correspondence with the present day orbit of Encke may indicate the width of the potential stream along Mercury's orbit or a previous cometary orbit. The extreme energy of the escaping calcium, estimated to have a temperature greater than 50000 K if the source is thermal, cannot be due to the impact process itself but must be imparted by an additional mechanism such as dissociation of a <b>calcium-bearing</b> molecule or ionization followed by recombination...|$|E

T HE lattice parameters of synthetic alkali feldspars have been determined by Donnay and Donnay (1952), and the cell dimensions and angles of the triclinic members may be used to determine their com-position.

In contrast, Smith (1956) has shown that there is no reliable X-ray method for the determination of the composition of the sodic plagioclases, because the lattice parameters vary both with thermal state and chemical composition; however, if the composition is known an indication of the thermal state may be obtained.

This paper focusses on deep dry soil mixing (DDSM), which introduces cementitious binders to soft soils via a rotating auger drill, thereby producing soil-cement columns. Ordinary Portland cement (CEM-I) is globally used across the construction industry and is {{the most commonly used}} binder for DDSM applications due to its high strength performance. However, CEM-I production is one of the world׳s most energy intensive and expensive industrial processes, contributing 5 – 7 % of the world׳s total CO 2. There is now significant pressure on the cement and construction industries to greatly reduce their CO 2 emissions by developing “greener” alternatives to CEM-I, which are both more environmentally and financially sustainable in the long-term. Alkali activated industrial by-products (IBP׳s) such as ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), known as geopolymers have been identified as potential alternatives. These are advantageous due to negating the need to transfer IBP׳s to landfill, their abundance, negligible or zero production costs.

In 2008 the most populous state of NSW accounted for 158. 2 Mt of these emissions, with 76 Mt of NSW emissions from stationary sources, such as power plants. NSW has not located adequate porous and permeable sedimentary basins to sequester carbon dioxide in underground reservoirs. Mineral carbonation is an alternative method of reducing emissions of CO₂ by chemical reaction with magnesium or <b>calcium-bearing</b> rocks to form insoluble carbonates, which bind CO₂ {{in a form that}} is stable over geological time. Current methods seek to replicate the natural weathering process of silicate rocks such as peridotite and serpentinite to form carbonates such as magnesite, but reduce the time for the carbonation reaction to proceed. New processing approaches focus on environmentally sustainable aqueous reactions which eliminate the use of acids, and biodissolution of reactants or precipitation of products using bacteria, which would reduce the energy penalty. Value-added byproducts which could offset costs include magnesite, magnetite, silica, heat, nickel and chromite. Refractory magnesite bricks are currently used for a variety of steel-making and other furnaces, and potentially for insulated housing. The aim is to approach the estimated cost of geosequestration,which is possibly grossly underestimated due to inherent variability of each individual basin. Mineral carbonation should be evaluated in NSW, and other countries where geosequestration is a less than viable option in the short term. The mineral carbonation process represents a stable solution to storing carbon dioxide, without risk of leakage, without the need for monitoring and with the promise of products which will make the process economically viable...|$|E
40|$|Sensors {{demonstrate}} huge {{potential in}} civil engineering for monitoring the health condition {{and performance of}} concrete structures. Amongst various chemical deterioration mechanisms causing inadequate durability of concrete structures, carbonation {{is one of the}} most severe mechanisms. It occurs from the chemical reactions between intruded CO 2 and <b>calcium-bearing</b> phases, hence is accompanied by the formation of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and the decrease of the alkalinity of concrete pore solution, causing corrosion of rebar in concrete. Thus, detecting carbonation process, especially, determining the carbonation profile (i. e. the content of carbonation products formed against the depth into concrete structure), is of great importance to the diagnosis of the health condition of concrete structures and the prediction of service life. Unfortunately, existing sensors for health monitoring systems suffer from various limitations. Optical fibre Raman technology offers a unique opportunity for developing a novel chemical sensor system capable of monitoring the service-condition of concrete in situ. In the current work, a bespoke ‘coaxial’ optical fibre sensing platform based on Raman spectroscopy was successfully established with a 514. 5 nm laser. All the optics were tailored for efficiently exciting and receiving signals from cementitious materials, and their diameters were restricted within 0. 5 inch in order to explore the feasibility of developing an embeddable miniature sensor system in the future. This sensing system was then employed to detect the carbonation mechanism of a plain Portland cement (PC) paste. The calcium carbonate polymorphs as well as the carbonation profile in the PC paste was successfully recognised and established with the results being verified favourably by bench-mounted Raman, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Thermogravimetry (TG) analyses.

This paper focused on the space distribution of the geochemical features of the formation water in Shiwu depression and its indication of the water-rock interaction processes. The fluid dynamic fields control the space distribution of the formation water. Due to the penetration of the meteoric water, the salinity is below 4500 mg/L at the basin margin and the severely faulted central ridge and increased basin-ward to 7000 - 10000 mg/L. The vertical change of the formation water can be subdivided into 3 zones, which correspond respectively to the free replacing zone (depth 1650 m) in hydrodynamics. In the free replacing zone, the formation water is NaHCO 3 -type fluid with its salinity increased to 10000 mg/L. The formation Water in the obstructive replacing zone is Na 2 SO 4 -type fluid and its salinity decreased to 5000 mg/L- 7000 mg/L because of the dehydration of the mud rocks. The formation water from the lagged zone is CaCl 2 -type fluid, but its salinity decreased sharply at the depth of 1650 m and then increased vertically to 10000 mg/L. This phenomenon can be best explained by the osmosis effect rather than the dehydration of the mud rocks. The relationships of Cl [...] HCO 3 - and Na++K+-Ca 2 + show that the initial water-rock interaction is the dissolution of NaCl and <b>calcium-bearing</b> carbonate, causing the increase of Na+-k(+) -Ca 2 +-Cl- and salinity. The succeeding water-rock interaction is albitization, {{which leads to the}} decrease of Na+ and the increase of Ca 2 + simultaneously and generates CaCl 2 -type fluid. The above analysis shows that the geochemistry evolution of the formation water is governed by the water-rock interactions, while its space distribution is controlled by the hydrological conditions. The analyzed water-rock interaction processes have been proved by other geological observations, suggesting that the fluid geochemistry is viable method to trace the fluid-rock interaction processes and has a broad applications in practice. It {{is a common}} way to trace the fluid flow and hydrocarbon accumulation by studying on the geochemistry of formation water. This paper focused on the space distribution of the geochemical features of the formation water in Shiwu depression and its indication of the water-rock interaction processes. The fluid dynamic fields control the space distribution of the formation water. Due to the penetration of the meteoric water, the salinity is below 4500 mg/L at the basin margin and the severely faulted central ridge and increased basin-ward to 7000 - 10000 mg/L. The vertical change of the formation water can be subdivided into 3 zones, which correspond respectively to the free replacing zone (depth 1650 m) in hydrodynamics. In the free replacing zone, the formation water is NaHCO 3 -type fluid with its salinity increased to 10000 mg/L. The formation Water in the obstructive replacing zone is Na 2 SO 4 -type fluid and its salinity decreased to 5000 mg/L- 7000 mg/L because of the dehydration of the mud rocks. The formation water from the lagged zone is CaCl 2 -type fluid, but its salinity decreased sharply at the depth of 1650 m and then increased vertically to 10000 mg/L. This phenomenon can be best explained by the osmosis effect rather than the dehydration of the mud rocks.

40|$|Alkali acetate based deicers {{have been}} found to cause {{significant}} distress in airfield concrete pavements, allegedly by a mechanism similar to conventional Alkali-Silica Reaction (ASR). Prior research indicated that aggregates having a history of being susceptible to ASR may undergo active deterioration when exposed to alkali acetate deicers. Further, deicer exposure was suspected to cause changes in the CSH gel composition by formation of secondary reaction products. Preliminary laboratory investigations had shown that the conditions conducive to triggering ASR could mainly be attributed to a drastic increase (jump) in the pH of the deicing solution, which occurs when it comes in contact with calcium hydroxide. The focus {{of this study was to}} further investigate the interaction between potassium acetate deicer solution and concrete components in an attempt to gain a better perspective of the reaction mechanism and its relevance with respect to the distress observed in the field. Thus, the broad objectives of this study included a detailed laboratory-based investigation into the influence of deicers on concrete microstructure and also a forensic investigation of cores collected from selected airports whose deicing operations predominantly involved application of potassium acetate deicer. ^ The fundamental part of the investigation involved utilizing techniques such as pore solution analysis and SEM-EDX to study the deleterious interaction of potassium acetate deicer solution on cementitious systems. In addition, experiments were conducted to verify the “pH jump” phenomenon, monitor mortar bar expansions and to study the influence of the deicer solution on the stability of siliceous aggregates. Based on the results of comparative experiments performed using reactive as well as non-reactive aggregates, it was concluded that in accelerated laboratory conditions the potassium acetate deicer could induce ASR in test specimens containing reactive aggregates. Further, microscopic evaluation revealed the formation of a <b>calcium-bearing</b> potassium sulfate phase as a result of the chemical interaction between potassium acetate deicer and hydrated cement paste. ^ The forensic investigation component of the study comprised of a thorough microscopic investigation of field cores and determination of the profile of deicer penetration into the pavement. The results indicated more or less uniform level of damage throughout the depth of the pavement with no appreciable penetration of the deicer into the pavement. Consequently, this part of the study did not yield sufficient evidence to confirm the role of the deicer in inducing or heightening damage due to ASR in the pavement. ...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this project {{was to develop a}} superior, regenerable, calcium-based sorbent for {{desulfurizing}} hot coal gas with the sorbent being in the form of small pellets made with a layered structure such that each pellet consists of a highly reactive lime core enclosed within a porous protective shell of strong but relatively inert material. The sorbent can be very useful for hot gas cleanup in advanced power generation systems where problems have been encountered with presently available materials. An economical method of preparing the desired material was demonstrated with a laboratory-scale revolving drum pelletizer. Core-in-shell pellets were produced by first pelletizing powdered limestone or other <b>calcium-bearing</b> material to make the pellet cores, and then the cores were coated with a mixture of powdered alumina and limestone to make the shells. The core-in-shell pellets were subsequently calcined at 1373 K (1100 C) to sinter the shell material and convert CaCO{sub 3 } to CaO. The resulting product was shown to be highly reactive and a very good sorbent for H{sub 2 }S at temperatures in the range of 1113 to 1193 K (840 to 920 C) which corresponds well with the outlet temperatures of some coal gasifiers. The product was also shown to be both strong and attrition resistant, and that it can be regenerated by a cyclic oxidation and reduction process. A preliminary evaluation of the material showed that while it was capable of withstanding repeated sulfidation and regeneration, the reactivity of the sorbent tended to decline with usage due to CaO sintering. Also {{it was found that the}} compressive strength of the shell material depends on the relative proportions of alumina and limestone as well as their particle size distributions. Therefore, an extensive study of formulation and preparation conditions was conducted to improve the performance of both the core and shell materials. It was subsequently determined that MgO tends to stabilize the high-temperature reactivity of CaO. Therefore, a sorbent prepared from dolomite withstands the effects of repeated sulfidation and regeneration better than one prepared from limestone. It was also determined that both the compressive strength and attrition resistance of core-in-shell pellets depend on shell thickness and that the compressive strength can be improved by reducing both the particle size and amount of limestone in the shell preparation mixture. A semiempirical model was also found which seems to adequately represent the absorption process. This model can be used for analyzing and predicting sorbent performance, and, therefore, it can provide guidance for any additional development which may be required. In conclusion, the overall objective of developing an economical, reusable, and practical material was largely achieved. The material appears suitable for removing CO{sub 2 } from fuel combustion products as well as for desulfurizing hot coal gas...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 91 - 104) The {{purpose of}} this study was to create a model for interpreting the provenance of offshore, petroleum-bearing sandstone reservoirs in the Taranaki Basin of New Zealand using sand samples from modern streams in the region as proxies. Twenty sand samples from streams draining plutonic, metamorphic, and sedimentary terranes exposed on South Island, New Zealand, were collected for petrographic analysis. Sand samples were air-dried, sieved into five sand fractions from very fine to very coarse, made into thin sections, and stained for recognition of potassium- and <b>calcium-bearing</b> feldspar. Using a microscope equipped with an automated point-counting stepper stage, 400 grains per sample were point counted and separated into 102 monomineralic and lithic fragment grain categories. Recalculated parameters were plotted on various ternary diagrams and analyzed for trends in composition with grain size and terrane. Overall, sand derived from erosion of the Median Batholith tends to have less quartz than sand from the Karamea Batholith and a higher monomineralic percentage of plagioclase, while sand from the Karamea Batholith has a higher proportion of monomineralic potassium feldspar. Sand derived from erosion of the Buller Terrane is the most quartz-rich of the non-plutonic terrane samples. Feldspar is rare in all the Eastern province terranes (Caples, Torlesse, and Dun Mountain-Maitai and Brook Street). Sand from the Dun Mountain-Maitai and Brook Street terranes has the lowest quartz content and is recognizable by distinctive serpentine pseudomorphs replacing mafic minerals. Pervasive pumpellyite is characteristic of metamorphic lithic fragments derived from some Eastern Province terranes, particularly the Caples along with the Dun Mountain-Maitai and Brook Street, exposed to prehnite-pumpellyite metamorphism along the boundary between the Australian and Pacific plates. Marlborough Schist-, Caples- and Torlesse Terrane-derived sands are recognizable on the basis of relatively high monomineralic quartz plus epidote and clinozoisite/zoisite together with either pumpellyite or albite and almost no potassium feldspar. Older Taranaki Basin sandstones, such as the Cretaceous North Cape Formation, appear to be derived from plutonic sources such as the Karamea and Median batholiths; a more detailed comparison of specific feldspar components in offshore wells would help distinguish between the two. Sandstones that are more lithic-rich in some wells and more quartz-rich in others, such as the Late Cretaceous Rakopi Formation, may be derived from the same plutonic sources with input from metasedimentary/-metavolcanic sources such as the Buller and Takaka terranes. Based on quartz, feldspar, and lithic fragment proportions, the Miocene Moki and Mount Messenger formations appear to be derived from the Marlborough Schist (Caples Terrane and Rakaia subterrane of the Torlesse Terrane), with some input from plutonic sources. More detailed analysis of feldspar and lithic types is needed to better fingerprint specific sand sources in these and younger Tertiary reservoir sandstones, especially as the latter may have been partly derived from arc magmatic rocks. This project provides an empirical dataset for continued comparison and analysis of offshore petroleum-bearing deposits and their source on the South Island of New Zealand, and a benchmark of modern sand petrography against which the petrography of older sandstones within the basin can be compared...|$|E
