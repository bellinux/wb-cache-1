5|$|Although no {{speech or}} text is used {{anywhere}} in the game aside from credits and interaction hints in the main menu, the six flower dreams follow a narrative arc. The player's starting location in each stage appears to be near the ending location of the previous one, and {{through the course of}} the game the player approaches a distant city. The first levels focus on restoring life and <b>color</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> landscape. After activating a series of windmills, the player flies through a nighttime field, illuminating darkened strings of lights until they reach the city. The city is full of menacing metal structures, small arcs of electricity, and washed-out buildings; the player enlivens the city in the final two levels and transforms it into a bright and cheerful place.|$|E

5|$|Melanins are {{a family}} of dark-pigmented {{substances}} found {{in a wide range}} of organisms. Chemically they are closely related to dopamine, and there is a type of melanin, known as dopamine-melanin, that can be synthesized by oxidation of dopamine via the enzyme tyrosinase. The melanin that darkens human skin is not of this type: it is synthesized by a pathway that uses L-DOPA as a precursor but not dopamine. However, there is substantial evidence that the neuromelanin that gives a dark <b>color</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brain's substantia nigra is at least in part dopamine-melanin.|$|E
5|$|Terphenylquinones are {{chemical}} compounds that are widely distributed among the Basidiomycetes division of fungi. Ascocoryne sarcoides {{has been shown}} to contain a terphenylquinone named ascocorynin—a chemical derivative of the compound benzoquinone. This pigment, when in alkaline solution, turns a dark violet, similar in <b>color</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fruit bodies of the fungus. Ascocorynin has moderate antibiotic activity, and was shown in laboratory tests to inhibit the growth of several Gram-positive bacteria, including the widely distributed food spoilage organism Bacillus stearothermophilus; however, it has no effect on the growth on Gram-negative bacteria, nor does it have any anti-fungal activity.|$|E
5|$|The Sognsvann Line was {{finished}} upgraded to metro standard on 7 January 1993, allowing the first T1000 trains to operate through the Common Tunnel into the western network, converting {{parts of the}} Oslo Tramway to metro. The Røa Line {{was finished}} on 19 November 1995, allowing all trains from the east to operate through the city center. To have sufficient metro-compatible trains, six two-car T2000 units were bought, and during the mid-1990s {{were considered to be}} a possible replacement for the T1000s. Starting in 1995, Oslo Sporveier made an interior and livery upgrade to the T1000 trains. The main red <b>color</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exterior was kept, but the doors and around the windows were painted blue. The lights and seats were changed, and the latter colored gray. The interior walls were painted red at the end, white on the sides, blue on the doors and received yellow hand bars.|$|E

In 2008, colored reflector panels were added to the narrow second floor windows in order to provide more <b>color</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exterior.

5|$|Over the Stock Exchange floor, Pflueger {{mounted a}} ceiling {{composed}} of interconnected sheet metal strips above {{which he used}} indirect lighting to soften the edges and reduce shadows made by traders on the floor below. The result was so effective that Pflueger used it on a much larger scale above the audience seating at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, where it extended from and formed a continuity with the incised art on the proscenium. In Oakland, Pflueger flanked the stage with structures {{that appeared to be}} pillars supporting the proscenium but were instead layered, curved sheets of thin metal behind which lighting instruments cast light indirectly to give the columns a suffused glow. In 1931, he used the same concept to frame the stage at the Bal Tabarin (now Bimbo's 365 Club), and to bring a changing palette of <b>color</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ceiling above the dance floor. Pflueger filed for and, in 1934, received two architectural lighting design patents, one for his ceiling grid with indirect lighting and one for the thin metal panels hiding lighting instruments. He used the patented ceiling grid once more in the Patent Leather Bar, in 1939.|$|E
