5|$|Because Perl is an {{interpreted}} language, it {{can give}} problems when efficiency is critical; in such situations, {{the most critical}} routines <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> in other languages (such as C), which can be connected to Perl via simple Inline modules or the more complex but flexible XS mechanism.|$|E
5|$|In the infinite-dimensional case, an {{orthonormal}} basis {{will not}} be a basis in the sense of linear algebra; to distinguish the two, the latter basis is also called a Hamel basis. That the span of the basis vectors is dense implies that every vector in the space <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> as the sum of an infinite series, and the orthogonality implies that this decomposition is unique.|$|E
5|$|In {{view of the}} above, {{observe that}} for SQL's WHERE clause a {{tautology}} similar {{to the law of}} excluded middle <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>written.</b> Assuming the IS UNKNOWN operator is present, p OR (NOT p) OR (p IS UNKNOWN) is true for every predicate p. Among logicians, this is called law of excluded fourth.|$|E

5|$|In {{a perfect}} scenario, this would enable every block {{to be written}} to its maximum life so they all fail at the same time. Unfortunately, the process to evenly {{distribute}} writes requires data previously written and not changing (cold data) to be moved, so that data which are changing more frequently (hot data) <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> into those blocks. Each time data are relocated without being changed by the host system, this increases the write amplification and thus reduces {{the life of the}} flash memory. The key is to find an optimum algorithm which maximizes them both.|$|E
5|$|Let g = gcd(a,b). Since a and b {{are both}} {{multiples}} of g, they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> a=mg and b=ng, {{and there is}} no larger number G>g for which this is true. The natural numbers m and n must be coprime, since any common factor could be factored out of m and n to make g greater. Thus, any other number c that divides both a and b must also divide g. The greatest common divisor g of a and b is the unique (positive) common divisor of a and b that is divisible by any other common divisor c.|$|E
5|$|Spacetimes are the arenas {{in which}} all {{physical}} events take place‚Äîan event is a point in spacetime specified by its time and place. The basic elements of spacetime are events. In any given spacetime, an event is a unique position at a unique time. Because events are spacetime points, in classical relativistic physics, the location of an elementary (point-like) particle {{at a particular time}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> as (x, y, z, t). A spacetime is the union of all events {{in the same way that}} a line is the union of all of its points, formally organized into a manifold.|$|E

5|$|The Cape sparrow's {{calls are}} chirps {{similar to those}} of the house sparrow, but much more musical and mellow. The basic call is used in flight and while {{perching}} socially and transcribed as chissip, chirrup, chreep, or chirrichup. A loud, distinctive call used by the male to advertise nest ownership <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> as tweeng or twileeng; this call can be extended into a jerky and repetitive song, chip cheerup, chip cheerup.|$|E
5|$|The cursive {{style has}} many unorthodox {{characteristics}} uncommon to Western writing systems. Vowels can be dropped if {{the writer is}} in a hurry and feels the word is obvious as in an abjad, letters <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> above or below the base line depending on what precedes them, and êêÆ is placed on letters after they are already written as in an abugida. Furthermore, unlike the typeset alphabet, the cursive alphabet has no letter case. These characteristics could have arisen because Watt was a local expert in Pitman shorthand, which is written in a similar way.|$|E
5|$|Then if V'i = V {{for each}} i, the {{resulting}} direct sum <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> in exponential notation as V‚äïN, or simply VN {{with the understanding}} that the direct sum is the default. We can again replace the set N with a cardinal number n to get V'n, although without choosing a specific standard set with cardinality n, this is defined only up to isomorphism. Taking V to be the field R of real numbers (thought of as a vector space over itself) and n to be some natural number, we get the vector space that is most commonly studied in linear algebra, the real vector space Rn.|$|E

5|$|Because all {{languages}} have a {{very large}} number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the Arabic script), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.|$|E

25|$|A {{transposition}} is a permutation which exchanges {{two elements}} and keeps all others fixed; for example (1 3) is a transposition. Every permutation <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> {{as a product}} of transpositions; for instance, the permutation g from above <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> as g = (1 2)(2 5)(3 4). Since g <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> {{as a product of}} an odd number of transpositions, it is then called an odd permutation, whereas f is an even permutation.|$|E
