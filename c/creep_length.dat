The thickness of the rafts, however, remained equal to the initial gamma prime size at least up through the onset of tertiary creep; this is a clear indication of the stability of the finely-spaced gamma-gamma prime lamellar structure.

40|$|The camber at {{the time}} of bridge {{erection}} of prestressed concrete bridge girders predicted by the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) was observed to often overestimate the measured cambers of girders erected at bridge sites in Minnesota, which, in some cases, was causing significant problems related to the formation of the bridge deck profile, the composite behavior of the girders and bridge deck, delays in construction and increased costs. Extensive historical data was collected from two precasting plants and MN counties and it was found that, on average, the measured cambers at release and erection were only 74 % and 83. 5 %, respectively, of the design values. Through data collection, analysis, and material testing, {{it was found that the}} primary causes of the low camber at release were concrete release strengths that exceeded the design values, the use of an equation for concrete elastic modulus that greatly under-predicted the measured values, and thermal prestress losses not accounted for in design.

40|$|Background and Aims: The plastic {{alterations}} of clonal architecture {{are likely}} to have functional consequences, as they affect the spatial distribution of ramets over patchy environments. However, {{little is known about the}} effect of mechanical stresses on the clonal growth. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clonal plasticity induced by mechanical stress consisting of continuous water current encountered by aquatic plants. More particularly, the aim was to test the capacity of the plants to escape this stress through clonal plastic responses. Methods: The transplantation of ramets of the same clone in two contrasting flow velocity conditions was carried out for two species (Potamogeton coloratus and Mentha aquatica) which have contrasting clonal growth forms. Relative allocation to clonal growth, to creeping stems in the clonal biomass, number and total <b>length</b> of <b>creeping</b> stems, spacer <b>length</b> and main <b>creeping</b> stem direction were measured. Key Results: For P. coloratus, plants exposed to water current displayed increased total <b>length</b> of <b>creeping</b> stems, increased relative allocation to creeping stems within the clonal dry mass and increased spacer length. For M. aquatica, plants exposed to current displayed increased number and total <b>length</b> of <b>creeping</b> stems. Exposure to current induced for both species a significant increase of the proportion of creeping stems in the downstream direction to the detriment of creeping stems perpendi Conclusions: This study demonstrates that mechanical stress from current flow induced plastic variation in clonal traits for both species. The responses of P. coloratus could lead to an escape strategy, with low benefits with respect to sheltering and anchorage. The responses of M. aquatica that may result in a denser canopy and enhancement of anchorage efficiency could lead to a resistance strategy. ...|$|R

Ukupno je zabilježeno 59 svojti biljaka. Od vrsta svojom nazočnošću prevladavale su paprati i to posebice u donjem dijelu ponikve i na dnu gdje je smanjena osvijetljenost i pove­ćana vlažnost zraka i tla u odnosu na rub ponikve.

(Fig. 1), formed in tectonically crushed Upper Cretaceous carbo­nate layers (limestone and breccia). Apart from karstification, which is evident in two speleological features, its {{development}} is today mostly affected by the slope processes (collapsing, landsliding and soil <b>creeping).</b> The <b>length</b> of the peripheral axis of the collapsed doline Japage is 64 m in the N-S direction, and 63 m in the E-W direction. In terms of dimensions, it is the largest such pheno­menon on the territory of Žumberak. The depth between the lowest point of the periphery and the bottom is 15 m. The highest altitude difference is 37. 7 m. The doline’s volume is 54. 000 m 3. The measurement of microclimatic parameters in Japage (carried out from 2007 to 2009) proved temperature inversion during the warm part of the year (Fig. 2). The relative air humidity is higher at the bottom, and lower towards the margins of the doline’s rim (Tab. 1). During the vegetation period in 2007 and 2008, the flora of Japage doline was also re­searched. Plants growing at various depths and expositions were registered, and a part of them was recorded in the profiles N-S and E-W (Fig. 5). The listed plants underwent the analysis of ecological indicator values and life forms. Al­together 59 plant taxa were registered (Tab. 2). Seventeen of them, i. e. 29 % of the total number of the recorded taxa is protected by the Nature Protection Act, and three are listed in the Red Book of Vascular Flora of Croatia as near threa­tened (NT). The life form analysis showed the predominance of hemicryptophy­tes and geophytes, corresponding to the moderate climate zone Japage belongs to. Ferns were the predominant species, particularly in the lower part of the doline and at its bottom, which has less sunlight and higher air humidity and soil moisture compared to the doline’s upper marginal parts (Fig. 6). Based on the analysis of ecological indicator values of the doline’s floristic composition (Fig. 7), we came to the conclusion that the soil in Japage is moderately moist, mostly low acidic to alkaline.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine if slow stable sub-critical crack growth may occur in ice. The Double Torsion fracture toughness geometry was used to explore this phenomena in first year large grained columnar sea ice, and fine grained freshwater columnar ice. The sea ice was tested during a field trip to Resolute NWT during April 1987, and the freshwater ice tested in the cold room at the Institute for Marine Dynamics in St. John's Nfld, from July 1987 to Jan 1988. [...] No sub-critical crack growth was observed in either type of ice. All crack growth was abrupt. In sea ice loading was up to one hour long, and in lab grown ice deadweight loading was applied for five days. This set the limit below which any sub-critical crack growth may have taken place as approximately 2 x 10 ⁻⁹ m/s. Quasi-static loading up to five minutes was also applied, as arrest was more likely after quick loading. [...] The fracture toughness of the sea ice was 113 ± 38 kNm⁻³/², for 0. 06 < K < 44 kNm⁻³/²S⁻¹, - 20 °C < temperature < - 14 °C; and for the fine grained ice 124 ± 38 kNm⁻¹/², 0. 7 < K < 85 kNm⁻³/², at - 20 °C. The arrest stress intensity factor was 91 ± 28 kNm⁻³/³ for the sea ice and 89 ± 14 kNm⁻³/² for the freshwater ice, rate independent, and similar to the high loading rate, or creep free fracture toughness of the two ices. The instability of all crack growth in ice was argued to be a consequence of the stability of the ice crystal structure against dislocation emission. The rate dependence of ice toughness is due to the screening of the crack tip by the dislocation mechanism of <b>creep.</b> [...] Crack <b>length</b> was not load rate dependent. It was suggested that the switch of failure mode in ice indentation by structures is a consequence of the rate dependent material properties of ice, possibly the modulus. A risk analysis, based on the material properties of creep crack growth, and the probability distribution function for ice strength, was shown to be inapplicable to ice. The arrest stress intensity factor was used to modify the model of indentation in ice, to accommodate this as a new crack length criterion, and to accommodate the stress relief influence of ice micro cracking...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{need for}} regional development has led engineers to find safe ways {{to construct the}} infrastructure of transportation on soft soils. Soft soil {{is not able to}} sustain external loads without having large deformations. The geotechnical properties of soft soil which is known for its low bearing capacity, high water content, high compressibility and long term settlement as well. In pavement engineering, either highway or runway as an infrastructure, a pavement encompasses three important parts namely traffic load, pavement and subgrade. Traffic load generated from tire pressure of vehicle and/or airplane wheels are usually around 550 kPa even more {{on the surface of the}} pavement. Pavement generally comprises granular materials with unbounded or bounded materials located between traffic load and subgrade, distributing the load to surface of subgrade. One of the promising soil improvement techniques is a piled embankment. When geosynthetics layer is unrolled over piles, it is known as geosynthetics supported piled embankment. Particularly in deep soft soil, when piles do not reach a hard stratum due to large thickness of the soft soil, the construction is an embankment on floating piles. Furthermore, because of different stiffness between piles and subsoil, soil arching effect would be developed there. By using Finite Element analysis, some findings resulted from experimental works and several field tests around the world as field case studies are verified. Some important findings are as follows: the stress concentration ratio is not a single value, but it would be changed depending on the height of embankment, consolidation process of subsoil, surcharge of traffic load, and tensile modulus of geosynthetics as well. Ratio height of embankment to clear piles spacing (h/s) around 1. 4 can be used as a critical value to distinguish between low embankment and high embankment. When geosynthetics is applied to reinforce a pavement/embankment, the vertical distance of geosynthetics layers and number of geosynthetics layers depend on the quality of pavement material. The lower layer of geosynthetics withstands a tensile stress higher than upper layer. Primary reinforcements for geosynthetics in piled embankments are located at span between piles with maximum strains at zones of adjacent piles. Traffic load that passes through on the surface of the pavement can reduce the soil arching, but it can be restored during the off peak hours. Settlements of embankments on floating piles can accurately be modelled using the consolidation calculation type, whereas the end-bearing piles may be used the plastic calculation type. Longer piles can be effectively applied to reduce a <b>creep.</b> By applying <b>length</b> of floating piles more than 20 % of soft soil depth, it would have a significant impact to reduce a creep on a deep soft soil...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. December 2011. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisor: Dr. Catherine French. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 225 pages, appendices A-H. The camber, or total net upward deflection, of prestressed concrete bridge girders {{is the result}} of the eccentric axial compression force provided by prestressing strands which counteract the deflections due to gravity loads. At the time of strand release, the deflection behavior of prestressed concrete girders is considered to be elastic, and it is common for bridge designers to use elastic camber calculations to predict the camber at release. To estimate the girder camber at bridge erection, a multiplier method is typically used which amplifies the camber at release to roughly account for the time-dependent effects (e. g., creep and shrinkage) that occur between release and erection. Additionally, there are numerous factors which affect the camber at erection and are not known at the time of design, including the girder storage condition in the precasting yard (i. e., bunking) and the age of the girder at erection, that further lead to potential errors in the estimates of the girder camber at erection. The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) uses the release camber calculations, based on gross section properties and elastic shortening losses, and a multiplier method to predict the camber at release and erection, respectively. An accurate estimate of camber at erection is important, because if the girders that arrive at a bridge site have cambers that are much lower or much higher than the expected design erection camber, it causes significant problems related to the formation of the bridge deck profile, the composite behavior of the girders and bridge deck, negative or very high stool height requirements, delays in construction and increased costs. It was recently observed that girders were being erected at bridge sites in Minnesota with cambers that were often much lower than predicted. The main side effect of this problem is required stool heights that are too high, especially at midspan. If the required stool heights approach the height of the protruding top flange shear reinforcement, the composite action needed between the girders and the bridge deck cannot be achieved, thus requiring the use of additional reinforcement or changing the entire bridge deck profile, which adds cost and creates delays. To account for this issue, MnDOT switched in late 2007 from the multiplier method recommended by Leslie A. Martin (1977) and PCI (2010), to a universal multiplier of 1. 5. However, the problem persisted and added costs and delays continued to occur. The primary objective of this study was to investigate and determine the cause of low girder camber at both release and bridge erection, which was observed by MnDOT, and to create an improved method for camber prediction, through modified calculations (if necessary) and a new set of multipliers. This objective was achieved through examination of extensive camber records from precasting plants and from in-situ measurements during erection of Minnesota I-girders, instrumentation and camber monitoring of fourteen girders from release to erection, concrete material testing, an analysis of prestress losses due to thermal effects, and PBEAM time-dependent camber modeling to investigate various effects including creep and shrinkage, girder support conditions during storage and age at erection. Extensive historical fabrication data was collected from two precasting plants (referred to as Plant A and B) for 1067 girders produced between 2006 and 2010. Camber at erection data was collected from the counties for 768 of those girders. On average, it was found that the measured camber at release for those 1067 girders was only 74 % of the design value. Furthermore, it was found that the measured camber at erection for the 768 girders was only 83. 5 %, on average, of the design value; and that girders erected at early ages almost always had cambers that were significantly lower than the design value. Because the predicted camber at erection is obtained by amplifying the elastic camber at release, inaccurate estimates of the camber at release can compound the problems of estimating the camber at erection. Various factors that affect the release camber were investigated, including concrete strength and modulus of elasticity, and variation in the strand prestress force. It was found that the increased concrete strengths achieved at the precasting plants (15. 5 % over the specified design value, on average) decrease camber due to the increased elastic modulus. Multiple concrete cylinder samples from both precasting plants were tested to investigate the concrete strength and elastic modulus over time. It was found that the ACI 363 R- 10 expression used by MnDOT to estimate the concrete modulus of elasticity from the specified concrete compressive strength greatly underestimates the elastic modulus of concrete produced at both precasting plants. The Pauw (ACI 318 - 08, AASHTO LRFD 2010) equation was determined to be the best predictor of the concrete elastic modulus, and when used to recalculate the release camber predictions for the 1067 historical girders, yielded significantly more accurate results. A thermal effects analysis was conducted to determine the effect of concrete and ambient temperatures on the strand stress at release. It was found that the combined thermal effects (and strand relaxation) cause a reduction in strand stress at release of approximately 3 %, on average. The position of each girder in the bed was also found to cause variations in prestress force through the redistribution of draped strand stress due to the harping sequence (at Plant A) and friction losses (at Plant B). Finally, it was found that high strand density, though often found in long MN-shape girders which had slightly lower release cambers, was not a major cause of reduced release camber. Thus, it was determined that the major causes for the discrepancy in release camber predictions and observed cambers were the increased concrete release strengths, the fact that the ACI 363 equation for concrete elastic modulus underestimated the measured elastic moduli, and strand prestress losses due to thermal effects. The effects of these primary factors were considered in re-predicting the cambers of a select data set for which detailed fabrication data, including curing and temperature records, were known. The girders included in this data set were those from which the concrete material samples were obtained, the instrumented girders, and selected girders from the historical data set. It was found that the accuracy of the re-predicted cambers was much greater than the original design cambers, and that the amount of variability in the results was reduced. Recommendations for modified camber calculations were made based on average effects (i. e., 15. 5 % release concrete strength increase, the Pauw equation for estimating concrete elastic modulus, and thermal prestress losses of 3 %). These recommendations were then tested against the entire historical girder database, and it was found that the discrepancy between measured and design camber values improved from approximately 74 % to 99 %, on average. This result confirmed that the revised release camber calculations provided much more accurate camber predictions than the original design equations. It should be noted that the overall scatter was not reduced because the recommendations were implemented in an average sense to all 1067 girders in the historical database. Once the discrepancy between measured and design release camber values was determined, various factors that affect long-term and erection camber were investigated, including solar radiation, relative humidity, concrete <b>creep</b> and shrinkage, <b>length</b> of cure and bunking/storage conditions. The program PBEAM was also validated for use in release and long-term camber modeling. It was found that solar radiation affects the measurement of camber by as much as 15 % during the course of a day, emphasizing that camber is a constantly fluctuating value. Relative humidity was found to cause changes in concrete creep and shrinkage and induce camber variability. High relative humidity during the winter months was also observed to cause slight increases in camber. Through PBEAM validation, it was found that the ACI 209 R- 92 concrete creep and shrinkage models provided the best results for long-term camber predictions and that the Mokhtarzadeh ACI 209 variation models provided a consistent lower bound. As such, the ACI 209 R- 92 creep and shrinkage models were used in the time-dependent camber modeling predictions. Weekend curing was found to cause lower erection cambers than weekday-cured girders, even though the camber discrepancy at release was less evident, due to additional stress recovery from cooler curing conditions. Finally, it was found that bunking/storage conditions led to increased cambers, additional camber variability, and possible exceedance of codified stress limits. Bunking limitations were recommended in order to limit these undesirable effects. These observations and results were used to create PBEAM inputs and ensuing long-term camber predictions for girders of varying depth and length. From these results, four “sets” of multipliers were created by comparing the long-term camber predictions to the current MnDOT and improved release camber predictions. Two of the sets of multipliers were developed to be applied to the MnDOT approach to predict release camber, and the other two were developed to be applied to the improved release camber predictions. For each approach, one set was based on a single multiplier to best predict erection camber and the other set recommended four different multipliers that reflected approximate age ranges for the girders at erection. These four different sets of multipliers were then applied to the historical girder data set and compared to the measured erection camber data. It was found that all four sets of multipliers greatly improved the erection camber predictions, with average measured vs. adjusted design erection camber percent values of 95. 6 %- 97. 1 %. However, only the “time-dependent” multipliers, which accounted for four potential ranges in girder age at erection, reduced the amount of scatter in the results. In particular, these multipliers alleviated the problem of over-predicted erection cambers for girders erected at early ages. Both the improved release camber predictions and the “Improved Time-Dependent” multipliers are recommended to be used by MnDOT for future camber predictions. In addition to the recommendations for the modified camber calculations at release and the new set of multipliers, recommendations for girder fabrication were also created to reduce camber variability and improve girder production at the precasting plants. Included in these recommendations are limitations for bunking/storage conditions and a spreadsheet created to produce more accurate temperature corrections (for Plants A and B). It was found that the amount of camber variability that can be expected using the recommended calculations and multipliers is approximately ± 15 %, or even lower if the girder fabrication recommendations are put into practice...|$|R
