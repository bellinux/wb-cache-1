The main industrial discharges originate from food, textile, pulp and paper, <b>chemical,</b> <b>tanning</b> and metal processing and electrical industries.

The impact of these toxic discharges on the marine environment and the sewage treatment works have been investigated. Increased concentrations in the water column and the sediments have been reported but there are no indications of accumulation of toxic metals in the body of benthic organisms. The impact on the imminent operation of the treatment works fur the sewage of Athens, have been investigated with the aid of pilot and bench scale studies. The results did not indicate a serious inhibition of the sensitive digestion and nitrification processes. However due to the high concentrations of the heavy metals, with average values approaching threshold values, it is important that appropriate action is taken to control industrial discharges through a revised and rational regulatory framework...|$|E

Objectives: the two goals for this study were to determine a) the optimal patch testing concentration for the four most widely used and rich of tannins vegetable tans (chestnut, mimosa, quebracho and tara) and b) the prevalence of irritant and allergic reactions to the four vegetable tans and two vegetable-tanned skins (sole leather, vacchetta). Materials and Methods: in phase 1 find the optimal patch testing concentration of the four vegetable tans diluted in petrolatum; this was evaluated by a serial dilution test (5, 2 and 1 %) in 100 subjects with various skin diseases. In phase 2, sensitization and irritation potential of the four vegetable tans in petrolatum 2 % and the two vegetable-tanned skins were investigated in 563 patients patch tested for eczematous dermatitis or any suspected allergic skin disorder. Results and discussion: the study demonstrates that optimal concentration to test vegetable tans in petrolatum is 2 % and that delayed positive reactions to tans are very rare (0. 4 %) and not clinically relevant, while those to vegetable-tanned skins (1. 2 %) are more frequent but probably relevant only in 3 of the 7 patients.

40|$|Abstract: Chromium (III) salts are {{the most}} widely used <b>chemicals</b> for <b>tanning</b> processes, but 60 - 70 % of total {{chromium}} salts reacts with the hides. In the other word, about 30 - 40 % of the chromium amount remains in the solids and liquid wastes (especially spent tanning solutions). Therefore, the removal and recovery of the chromium content of these wastewaters are necessary for environmental protection and economic reasons. Removal and recovery of chromium were carried out by using precipitation process. For this purpose, three precipitating agents calcium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and magnesium oxide were used. The effects of pH, stirring time, settling rate and sludge volume were studied in batch experiments. Results show that the optimum pH is 8 - 9 and the good sludge with high settling rate and lower volume obtain by the MgO precipitating agent.

In 1926 four chemical companies merged to form Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). As the century progressed there was diversification of industry.

40|$|The {{leather tanning}} {{industry}} {{is characterized by}} the production of different kinds of effluents, generated in each step of leather processing. These effluents have various chemical compounds which may cause toxicity and endocrine disruption and are thus known as endocrine disrupting <b>chemicals</b> (EDC). <b>Tanning</b> stabilizes the protein structure of the hide and imparts heat stability, enhanced tensile properties, and resistance to microbial degradation. Currently most high quality leather is "chrome-tanned," produced by treatment of the hide with salts of the mineral chromium. In this study, the wastewater characteristics and ecotoxicity before and after tanning and retanning processes using mimosa tannin are assessed. Vegetable leather production procedure was followed using one dose mimosa tannin. Leather quality was evaluated according to standard methods. Wastewater characteristics showed that mimosa contributed high organic content to the wastewater. Although vegetable tannin was used the effluent toxicity was observed in tanning and retanning effluents. The preliminary results also showed that leather quality tests failed or at minimum level to comply with the standard values indicating that there is still a need to optimize the procedure including mimosa dose.

Petronas Penapisan Melaka Light Crude (B) with TAN values of 2. 52 was studied. The ammoniated polyethylene glycol (PEG) was used as the deacidifying agent in this study with a concentration range of 100 - 2500 mg/L.

The microstructure and <b>chemical</b> constituent of <b>TaN</b> coatings were characterized, and were found to consist of a hard fcc-TaN outer layer. Besides, the addition of TaN coatings greatly increased the hardness and modulus of pristine Ti from 2. 54 ± 0. 20 to 29. 88 ± 2. 59 GPa, and from 107. 19 ± 6. 98 to 295. 46 ± 19. 36 GPa, respectively. Potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies indicated that TaN coating exhibited higher MIC resistance in comparison to bare Ti and TiN-coated coating in two bacteria-containing artificial saliva solutions. Moreover, the biofilm experiment showed that the TaN-decorated Ti sample possessed good antibacterial performance. The SEM and XPS results after biofilm removal demonstrated that TaN film remained its integrity and stability, while TiN layer detached from Ti surface in the bio-corrosion tests, demonstrating the anti-MIC behavior and the strong binding property of TaN coating to Ti substrate.

40|$|Waste {{management}} in the leather industry worldwide {{is an issue of}} major importance for both solid and liquid wastes. It has been recognised that there are major environmental impacts from the poorly managed disposal of such wastes and these have a clear health impact upon human society. Within Europe, under EU driven legislation, the costs of wastes management are increasing rapidly and there is a clear need to research improved methods to cost effectively deal with leather industry wastes. Biodegradation (anaerobic), as a management option, of solid wastes from the leather industry is an area that is attracting increased interest in recent years as being a technique that has wide public acceptability as well as process efficiency. However, tanning agents that prolong the lifetime of leather goods {{have a negative impact on}} biodegradation and this needs to be addressed before efficient treatment can occur. To drive the agenda this research has the aims of • Highlighting the effects of tanning agent on anaerobic digestion. • Understanding the mechanism(s) by which different leather tannages can biodegraded. • Developing a process to reverse the action of tannage. Leather solid wastes were anaerobically digested using Serum Bottle Assays (SBA). The effect of a range of vegetable, mineral and aldehyde tanning agents of leather on the rate of anaerobic digestion was assessed. Common tanning agents used included; myrica, valonea, glutaraldehyde and chrome. To further identify key factors for cost effective anaerobic digestion, tanned hide powders and tanned leathers were also pre-treated using autoclaving, liming, enzymes etc, in an attempt to determine whether tannage may be reversed. Major techniques used in the research include: anaerobic digestion, Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP), Total Solids contents (TS), Gas Chromatography (GC) and Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Hydrolysable tannins are less resistant to anaerobic digestion than condensed tannins. However, enzymatic pre-treatment reduces the resistance and this offers a new effective pre-treatment route. Thermal pre-treatment also decreased resistance to anaerobic digression especially for chrome, glutaraldehyde, myrica and tannic acid <b>tanned</b> leathers. <b>Chemical</b> pre-treatment also generally lowered the resistance to anaerobic digestion. Selective pre-treatment offers a means of improving the cost effectiveness of anaerobic digestion of leather and therefore enabling a new waste management method to be adopted by the industry. A relationship emerges, in some cases, between <b>chemical</b> structure of <b>tanning</b> agent and inhibition of anaerobic digestion. This offers the possibility of producing new, designed organic tanning agents with, suitable properties, to be adopted by the industiy, The research agenda within the leather industry is still ongoing and recommendations for future research are addressed...|$|R
