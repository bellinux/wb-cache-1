40|$|The {{consequences}} of K recycling and accumulation in the renal medulla were examined {{by measuring the}} effect of elevated K concentration on ion transport by the medullary thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. Perfused and bathed in vitro, thick limbs from both mouse and rabbit displayed a graded, reversible reduction of transepithelial voltage after increasing K concentration from 5 to 10, 15, or 25 mM. The effect was reproducible whether osmolality was 328 or 445 mosmol/kg H 2 O, and whether K replaced Na or <b>choline.</b> Net <b>chloride</b> absorption and transepithelial voltage were reduced by almost 90 % when ambient K concentration was 25 mM. When either lumen or bath K was increased to 25 mM, net Na absorption was reduced. There was spontaneous net K absorption when perfusate and bath K concentration was 5 mM. Analysis of transepithelial K transfer after imposition of chemical gradients demonstrated rectification in the absorptive direction. Absorption of K by this segment provides a means to maintain high medullary interstitial concentration. Accumulation of K in the outer medulla, by reducing NaCl absorption, would increase volume flow through the loop of Henle and increase Na and water delivery to the distal nephron. K recycling thus might provide optimum conditions for K secretion by the distal nephron...|$|R

Methods Sweat patches were placed on eight trained adolescent Highland dancers (age = 13. 6 ± 2. 3 yr), who then participated in a dance class for 2 hours. Patches were removed, and the sweat recovered via centrifugation. The sweat was subsequently analyzed for betaine, <b>choline,</b> sodium, potassium, <b>chloride,</b> lactate, glucose, urea and ammonia. Results Betaine was present in the sweat of all subjects (232 ± 84 μmol·L - 1), which is higher than typically found in plasma. The concentration of several sweat components were correlated, in particular betaine with most other measured components. Conclusion Betaine, an osmoprotectant and methyl donor, is a component of sweat that may be lost from the body in significant amounts. </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the release of}} acetylcholine (ACh) and dopamine (DA) using a novel probe through which striatal neurons could be both superfused and stimulated electrically in both anesthetized and freely moving awake animals. Optimal stimulation parameters for eliciting ACh release from cholinergic neurons differed from those required for eliciting DA release from dopaminergic terminals: at 0. 6 ms pulse duration, 20 Hz and 200 microA, ACh release increased to 357 +/- 30 % (P < 0. 01) of baseline and was blocked {{by the addition of}} tetrodotoxin (TTX). Pulse durations of 2. 0 ms or greater were required to increase DA release. Unlike ACh release, DA release showed no frequency dependence above 5 Hz. The maximal evoked releases of ACh and DA were 556 +/- 94 % (P < 0. 01) and 254 +/- 38 % (P < 0. 05) of baseline, respectively. Peripheral administration of <b>choline</b> (Ch) <b>chloride</b> (30 - 120 mg/kg) to anesthetized animals caused dose-related (r = 0. 994, P < 0. 01) increases in ACh release; basal release rose from 117 +/- 7 % to 141 +/- 5 % of initial baseline levels (P < 0. 05) and electrically evoked ACh release rose from 386 +/- 38 % to 600 +/- 34 % (P < 0. 01) in rats given 120 mg/kg. However, Ch failed to affect basal or evoked DA release although neostigmine (10 microM) significantly elevated basal DA release (from 36. 7 fmol/ 10 min to 71. 5 fmol/ 10 min; P < 0. 05). In awake animals, Ch (120 mg/kg) also elevated both basal (from 106 +/- 7 % to 154 +/- 17 %; P < 0. 05) and electrically evoked (from 146 +/- 13 to 262 +/- 16 %; P < 0. 01) ACh release.

In contrast to the graded inward spread of contraction initiated by a moderate depolarization, the contraction in response to a strong negative current was observed to spread transversely around the whole perimeter but not {{through the center of the}} fiber.

The valuable investigations of A. J.

As a result of recent investigations on the embryonic hearts of Fundulus, Armstrong (2) concluded that acetylcholine {{does not have a}} dirept action on the cardiac musculature but produces its action by stimulating the intramyocardial vagus postganglionic fibers which in turn inhibit the heart.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{reducing}} the external sodium concentration, [Na]o, on resting potential, action potential, membrane current, and transient current reversal potential in Myxicola giant axons was studied. Tris chloride {{was used as a}} substitute for NaCl. Preliminary experiments were carried out to insure that the effect of Tris substitution could be attributed entirely to the reduction in [Na]o. Both <b>choline</b> and tetramethylammonium <b>chloride</b> were found to have additional effects on the membrane. The transient current is carried largely by Na, while the delayed current seems to be independent of [Na]o. Transient current reversal potential behaves much like a pure Nernst equilibrium potential for sodium. Small deviations from this behavior are consistent with the possibility of some small nonsodium component in the transient current. An exact PNa/PK for the transient current channels could not be computed from these data, but is certainly well greater than unity and possibly quite large. The peak of the action potential varied with [Na]o as expected for a sodium action potential with some substantial potassium permeability at the time of peak. Resting membrane potential is independent of [Na]o. This finding is inconsistent with the view that the resting membrane potential is determined only by the distribution of K and Na, and PNa/PK. It is suggested that PNa/PK's obtained from resting membrane potential-potassium concentration data do not always have the physical meaning generally attributed to them...|$|R
