50|$|Adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), {{which is}} also known as <b>cobamamide</b> and dibencozide, is, along with {{methylcobalamin}} (MeCbl), one of the active forms of vitamin B12. It is available as a nutritional supplement, along with cyanocobalamin, methylcobalamin, and hydroxocobalamin.|$|E
50|$|Cobalamin analogs {{prepared}} by this method include the naturally occurring coenzymes methylcobalamin and <b>cobamamide,</b> and other cobalamins {{that do not}} occur naturally, such as vinylcobalamin, carboxymethylcobalamin and cyclohexylcobalamin. This reaction is under review {{for use as a}} catalyst for chemical dehalogenation, organic reagent and photosensitized catalyst systems.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} these studies was to {{evaluate}} {{the effect of the}} cryoselection of carp sperm of multiple age groups depending on the quality of thawed sperm after modification of the composite cryoprotective medium, which was used for the dilution of native sperm before freezing. Methodology. Coenzyme B 12 (<b>cobamamide),</b> blood plasma of Prussian carp (Carassius gibelio), which was subjected to natural cold-acclimation, and purified protein antifreeze tmAFP isolated from larval mealworm (Tenebrio molitor), which also was subjected to natural cold-acclimation, were sued as modifiers. Findings. The results of the study demonstrated that qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the defrosted sperm, results of the incubation, rearing of embryos and larvae of Nyvky scaled carp (NLC), as well as fish culture parameters of produced young-of-the-year depended from on the composition of cryoprotective medium. The best results were demonstrated for the experimental groups, obtained {{with the use of the}} cryoprotective solution supplemented with purified antifreeze protein tmAFP. The larvae obtained from the sperm cryopreserved with the addition of cryoprotective medium TmAFP had better resistance to dehydration, surpassing the experimental groups obtained from the modifiers of Prussian carp plasma and <b>cobamamide.</b> There is a consolidation in the action of the related extracellular cryoprotectors, which were isolated from the cold-resistant organisms. And carp produced with their used demonstrated better performance during their rearing. The fact can be established that the manifestation of cryoselective effect depends on the integrity of sperm hereditary material and does not depend on the effect of extremely low temperatures on the cell membranes. Originality. There were the first experiments, where Prussian carp plasma and antifreeze protein tmAFP were used as extracellular cryoprotectors. Practical value. The modifications of composite cryoprotective media with the use of extracellular cryoprotectants and <b>cobamamide</b> examined in this paper can be recommended for the cryopreservation of carp sperm with a goal to create cryobanks of fish genetic resources as well as for their large scale reproduction...|$|E
40|$|Following our {{previous}} {{works on the}} morphology (Pica et al., 1983) and cytochemistry (Grimaldi et al., 1983) of the blood cells of Torpedoes, hereunder are reported {{the results of the}} observations on histological sections and imprints of lymphomieloid tissues, spleen and thymus before and after injections with cobalamide and folic acid. Erythropoiesis, lymphocytopoiesis, thrombocytopoiesis and, very likely, monocytopoiesis take place in the spleen. Erythroid cells are: proerythroblasts, basophilic erythroblasts I and II, acidophilic erythroblasts and mature erythrocytes. Lymphocytopoiesis evolves from lymphoblast to promielocyte and mature small lymphocyte. Thrombocytopoiesis starts from prothrombocytes and evolves first into round thrombocytes and then into spindle shaped ones. Monocytopoiesis occurs in lymphomieloid tissue (oesophageal and epigonal) through maturative stages similar to theose of mammals: mieloblasts, promielocytes and mielocytes both neutrophilic and eosinophilic. In the animals caught in autumn which show a slowed hemopoiesis, the treatment with injections of <b>cobamamide</b> and folic acid produces an increase of mithotic index both in red and white cells and their maturation speedrate rises to the same level as the maximum of summer season. Thymus consists of lobes and lobules which contain a cortex and a medulla as in man. The cell types here present: epithelial-reticular cells which grow and fill of acidophilic granules, large adypocytes and Hassal's corpuscles. Lymphocytopoiesis does not presumably take place here...|$|E
