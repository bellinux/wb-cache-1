40|$|Abstract. Customs unions {{constitute}} {{agreements to}} engage in free intra-union trade and to levy <b>common</b> <b>external</b> <b>tariffs</b> on trade with non-members. Existing theoretical models do not agree on how the <b>common</b> <b>external</b> <b>tariffs</b> are chosen; different, somewhat ad hoc choice rules have been employed. In this paper, a model of customs union formation is developed in which the Pareto principle and the assumption of unanimity are used to construct a mechanism for the choice of <b>common</b> <b>external</b> <b>tariffs.</b> The model is structured as a three-stage game in which union members select <b>common</b> <b>external</b> <b>tariffs</b> that yield utility outcomes that are Pareto optimal and dominate the stand-alone alternative. Numerical examples are use to demonstrate the wide range {{in the nature of}} these outcomes. Our results are discussed in relation to the delegation principle developed by Gatsios and Karp and to modeling approaches reported in the customs unions literature. The paper emphasizes the importance of modeling the formation of the customs union agreement...|$|R

In this way, the products from the free-trade zones can have the more favorable tax treatment established under Southern Common Market, given to the merchandise produced in the normal customs zones of each member state or, {{in the case of}} certain special products, can have the normal customs treatment prevailing in each nation. Products coming from outside of Mercosur are highly taxed so that local companies do not feel the need to compete with large international companies.|$|E
25|$|Two of the {{original}} core objectives of the European Economic Community were {{the development of a}} common market, subsequently becoming a single market, and a customs union between its member states. The single market involves the free circulation of goods, capital, people, and services within the EU, and the customs union involves the application of a <b>common</b> <b>external</b> <b>tariff</b> on all goods entering the market. Once goods have been admitted into the market they cannot be subjected to customs duties, discriminatory taxes or import quotas, as they travel internally. The non-EU member states of Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland participate in the single market but not in the customs union. Half the trade in the EU is covered by legislation harmonised by the EU.|$|E
25|$|Inter-territorial {{co-operation}} {{between the}} Kenya Colony, the Uganda Protectorate, and the Tanganyika Territory was formalised in 1948 by the EAHC. This provided a customs union, a <b>common</b> <b>external</b> <b>tariff,</b> currency, and postage. It also dealt with common services in transport and communications, research, and education. Following independence, these integrated activities were reconstituted and the EAHC {{was replaced by}} the EACSO, which many observers thought would lead to a political federation between the three territories. The new organisation ran into difficulties {{because of the lack of}} joint planning and fiscal policy, separate political policies, and Kenya's dominant economic position. In 1967, the EACSO was superseded by the EAC. This body aimed to strengthen the ties between the members through a common market, a common customs tariff, and a range of public services to achieve balanced economic growth within the region.|$|E

25|$|An import or {{export tariff}} (also called customs duty or impost) is a charge for the {{movement}} of goods through a political border. Tariffs discourage trade, {{and they may be}} used by governments to protect domestic industries. A proportion of tariff revenues is often hypothecated to pay government to maintain a navy or border police. The classic ways of cheating a tariff are smuggling or declaring a false value of goods. Tax, tariff and trade rules in modern times are usually set together because of their common impact on industrial policy, investment policy, and agricultural policy. A trade bloc is a group of allied countries agreeing to minimize or eliminate tariffs against trade with each other, and possibly to impose protective tariffs on imports from outside the bloc. A customs union has a <b>common</b> <b>external</b> <b>tariff,</b> and the participating countries share the revenues from tariffs on goods entering the customs union.|$|E
25|$|As a {{first step}} towards the CSME, Haiti was due to enter the trade in goods regime of the Single Market in January 2010 (earlier targets had been for some time in 2009) but could not do so because of the earthquake. Up until that point much work had been done by CROH and its Haitian {{government}} counterpart, the Bureau de Coordination et de Suivi or BCS (Office of Coordination and Monitoring), on the technical work necessary to bring the Haitian national tariff {{in line with the}} Caricom <b>Common</b> <b>External</b> <b>Tariff</b> (CET). The next step that had to be taken for Haiti to commence full free trade in goods within the CSME was therefore for the Haitian Parliament to pass legislation adopting the Caricom External tariff as Haiti’s national tariff. In mid 2009, the Government of Haiti announced that it would be ready to participate fully in free trade in goods within the CSME by 1 January 2010; and in fact through a revised Custom Act adopted by the Haitian Parliament in late 2009, 20-30% of the Caricom CET was incorporated into the Haitian national tariff. However soon after Haiti's progress towards full adoption of the CET began to stall with the dismissal of the Government of Prime Minister Michèle Pierre-Louis in November 2009 and was then put on hold {{as a result of the}} January 2010 earthquake. To assist in stimulating economic activity, the Council for Trade and Economic Development (COTED) in December, approved a request for some Haitian products to be exported within the Single Market on a non-reciprocal preferential basis for three years. Consultations are on-going towards approval of additional items from an original list which Haiti submitted. The concession became effective from 1 January 2011. CARICOM Secretariat officials are continuing their training exercises with Haitian customs officials to facilitate their understanding of the CSME’s trading regime.|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} the Michigan Model of World Production and Trade to {{simulate}} the economic effects on the NAFTA member countries and other major trading countries/regions of a prospective new round of WTO multilateral trade negotiations, the variety of free trade agreements (FTAs) that the NAFTA members have negotiated or are considering, and {{the adoption of a}} system of <b>common</b> <b>external</b> <b>tariffs</b> by the NAFTA members. We estimate that an assumed reduction of post-Uruguay Round tariffs on agricultural and industrial products and services barriers by 33 percent in a new WTO trade round would increase world welfare by $ 613. 0 billion, with gains of $ 177. 3 billion for the United States, $ 13. 5 billion for Canada, $ 6. 5 billion for Mexico, and significant gains for all other industrialized and developing countries. If there were global free trade, world welfare would increase three-fold to $ 1. 9 trillion and the country/region gains would be similarly larger. Regional FTAs such as an expansion of NAFTA to include Chile and a Western Hemisphere FTA would increase global and member-country welfare but much less than a new WTO multilateral trade round would. Separate bilateral FTAs negotiated or being considered by Canada, Mexico, and the United States would have positive, though generally small, welfare effects on the partner countries, but potentially disruptive sectoral employment shifts in some countries. There would be trade diversion and detrimental welfare effects on some nonmember countries for both the regional and bilateral FTAs analyzed. If the NAFTA members were to adopt a system of <b>common</b> <b>external</b> <b>tariffs</b> to replace their existing differentiated <b>external</b> <b>tariffs,</b> a system based on trade weights would have less distortive effects on trade and welfare than a system based on simple averages or production-weighted tariffs. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{employs the}} CGE {{approach}} to appraise three distinctive issues. Using hypothetical data, Essay 1 estimates how customs union outcomes {{are sensitive to}} market size and competitiveness. Further, <b>common</b> <b>external</b> <b>tariffs</b> are adjusted to ensure necessarily welfare-improving outcomes, thereby completely eliminating trade diversion. The results confirm that members’ gains are proportional to the union size, {{and the degree of}} market competition significantly alters the welfare outcome. Once <b>common</b> <b>external</b> <b>tariffs</b> are endogenised, members gain less while the whole world gains more as non-members become unaffected by trade diversion. Essay 2 assesses the FTAs Thailand has reached with Japan, China, India, Australia and New Zealand. The model constructed in Essay 1 is extended to accommodate the GTAP 6. 0 database. It explicitly determines commodity market competition by sector and labour market paradigm by skill level to better reflect economic reality. Among these FTAs, JTEPA is the best, whilst TNZCEPA is the least beneficial FTA for Thailand. The gains from bilateral FTAs are trivial compared to those from the groupings that include ASEAN. Overall, trade diversion is offset by trade creation, thus the world finds all of the Thailand’s FTAs welfare-improving, albeit marginal. Essay 3 evaluates tax issues for India. It investigates the implications of domestic tax hikes tailored for the rebalancing of government revenue after an FTA among ASEAN, India, China and Japan. Income tax emerges as most effective, whereas production tax appears as least favourable. However, once taking into account the existence of untaxable economic activities, the most benign options measured by real output become consumption, production, income, and factor input taxes, respectively. Hence, the introduction of the substitution elasticity between taxable and untaxable goods largely alters the outcomes, and the informal sector ought not to be neglected if the government is to gauge true effects of domestic tax tools...|$|R

40|$|This {{analysis}} {{is concerned with}} the direct impacts of the regulation of food markets under SACU on food security in the BLS countries. There are two basic rules in SACU determining trade in food and non-food products (Ettinger, 1974; Maasdorp, 1986). The first of these is that common tariffs exist for trade {{with the rest of the}} world. The second is that the internal market of SACU represents a free-trade area. The <b>common</b> <b>external</b> <b>tariffs</b> of SACU are fixed by the Republic of South Africa. These rules of SACU link the agricultural price policy in the Republic of South Africa with food imports and food security in the BLS countries. It is the objective of this paper to investigate this linkage which has been hitherto ignored in the literature. The paper analyzes quantitatively how the agricultural policy of the Republic of South Africa affects food security in Botswana and particularly how this was transmitted via the rules of SACU during the period 1969 - 84. The analysis begins by describing the institutional relationship between agricultural price policy in South Africa and food security in the BLS countries. Section 3 considers empirically what impacts agricultural policy in South Africa has had upon the food import sector of Botswana, and the magnitude, trends and instabilities of these economic variables are investigated. The {{analysis is}} based upon econometrically estimated food import demand equations for Botswana. Section 4 takes into consideration the effects of the customs union remittances received from SACU by Botswana. The effects of customs union membership, as they apply to food security in Botswana are tested by the hypothesis as to whether the joint impact of the <b>external</b> <b>tariff</b> policy on food and of customs union revenues was positive or negative. Finally, in section 5 the main results of the analysis are summarized and suggestions for further research are indicated. ...|$|R
