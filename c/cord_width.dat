5000|$|Each type of sail, {{acting as}} an airfoil, has {{characteristic}} coefficients of lift (CL [...] ) and lift-induced drag (CD [...] ) {{at a given}} angle of attack, which follow that same basic form of:Where force (F) equals lift (L) for forces measured perpendicular to the airstream to determine C = CL or force (F) equals drag (D) for forces measured {{in line with the}} airstream to determine C = CD on a sail of area (A) and a given aspect ratio (length to average <b>cord</b> <b>width).</b> These coefficients vary with angle of attack (αj for a headsail) with respect to the incident wind (VA for a headsail). This formulation allows determination of CL and CD experimentally for a given sail shape by varying angle of attack at an experimental wind velocity and measuring force on the sail {{in the direction of the}} incident wind (D—drag) and perpendicular to it (L—lift). As the angle of attack grows larger, the lift reaches a maximum at some angle; increasing the angle of attack beyond this critical angle of attack causes the upper-surface flow to separate from the convex surface of the sail; there is less deflection of air to windward, so the sail as airfoil generates less lift. The sail is said to be stalled. At the same time, induced drag increases with angle of attack (for the headsail: αj [...] ).|$|E
40|$|The interrenal and {{medullary}} cords {{as well as}} {{the blood}} vessels and connective tissue proportions in the adrenal glands of the male Nigerian fowl (Gallus domesticus) and guinea-fowl (Numida meleagris) were studied by microstereological techniques. Laying domestic fowl of the Rhode Island Red breed were entirely defeathered and maintained in a hot, humid pen for a period of three months, after which the adrenal glands were also studied microstereologically. Interrenal <b>cord</b> <b>width</b> was also measured in all the birds studied. The interrenal cords of the subscapular zone were consistently wider than those cords in the inner zone of the adrenal glands. This clearly suggested morphological zoning. The proportion of interrenal tissue was significantly greater in the guinea-fowl than in the Nigerian fowl, but the medullary tissue and the blood vessels and connective tissue were not significantly different. Interrenal hypoplasia or medullary hyperplasia occurred in the defeathered Rhode Island Red fowl as compared to the control birds of the same breed and sex. The significance of these findings is discussed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} a fluid dynamic study of blood flow within the umbilical vessels {{of the human}} maternal-fetal circulatory system. In particular it evaluates {{the efficacy of the}} umbilical coiling index (UCI) in predicting the blood vessel pressure drop, and develops clinically viable indices for the quantification of umbilical cord flow resistance. A numerical approach is developed employing the finite element method via the open-source c++ code oomph-lib, available from the University of Manchester. This permits the description of an umbilical vessel geometry as a fully three-dimensional rigid tube in order to consider a wide range of cords subject to steady and unsteady boundary conditions. The thesis is composed of three main studies. The first concerns steady incompressible Newtonian flow through model geometries representative of the umbilical vessels. It is found that the UCI is unable to distinguish between cords of significantly varying pressure and flow characteristics, which are typically determined by the vessel curvature, torsion and length. Larger scale geometric non-uniformities superposed over the inherent coiling, including cords exhibiting width and/or local UCI variations as well as loose true knots, typically produce a small effect on the total pressure drop. Crucially, this implies that a helical geometry of mean coiling may be used to determine the steady vessel pressure drop through a more complex cord. The presence of vessel constriction, however, drastically increases the steady pressure drop and alters the flow profile. The second study provides an analysis of pulsatile incompressible Newtonian flow through arterial geometries. The steady pressure drop is found to approximate the time-averaged value with high accuracy over a wide range of arteries. Furthermore, the relative peak systolic pressure measured over the period is found to remain virtually constant and approximately 25 % below the equivalent straight pipe value for a large range of non-straight vessels. Interestingly, this suggests that the coiled structure dampens extreme pressures within the arterial cycle and may provide another possible evolutionary benefit to the coiled structure of the cord. Having shown the UCI ineffective at predicting the vessel pressure drop, the third and final study presents two alternative indices for the diagnosis of cord pathology based on steady calculations. The umbilical pressure index, PX, and ow index, QX, quantify the deviation of a cord geometry from typical conditions by considering the steady pressure and ow-rate, respectively. These indices are calculated based on a combination of empirical and interpolated numerical data and require only one additional geometric measurement to the calculation of the UCI; namely the <b>cord</b> <b>width.</b> Together the indices provide a non-invasive measure of the flow-resistance inherent to a particular cord geometry, and allow comparison with typical values in pregnancy. Further testing of the indices is required to determine their efficacy in a clinical setting, however, their simple and robust nature ensures that they are promising candidates. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The whorls of the protoconch are decollated, thepit left in {{the apex}} of the type shows that it must have been strongly immersed in the first of the turns of the teleoconch. The 4½ whorls of the teleoconch are strongly rounded, and feebly shouldered at the summit. They are marked by rather slender axial ribs, of which 20 occur upon all the turns. In addition to the axial ribs, the whorls are marked by 5 spiral cords, which are a little stronger than the ribs. The cords are about as wide as the spaces that separate them. Their junctions with the ribs form rounded tubercles, while the spaces enclosed between them are strongly impressed concaved pits. The suture is not channeled. The base of the shell is rather long, somewhat inflated, and well rounded. It ismarked by 10 strong spiral cords, which decrease in size gradually and regularly from the periphery to the umbilical chink. The grooves between these spiral cords, which are about equal to the <b>cords</b> in <b>width,</b> are armed by numerous slender axial riblets. The oval aperture is decidedly effuse anteriorly. The posterior angle is acute. The thin outer lip is rendered wavy at the edge by the external sculpture. The inner lip is long, oblique, curved, and somewhat revolute. It is provided with a strong oblique fold at its insertion. The parietal wall is covered by a moderately thick callus.|$|R
5000|$|... (Original {{description}} by Paul Bartsch) The size of {{the shell}} varies between 10 mm and 20 mm. The shell has a regularly conic shape. It is flesh colored, with squarish maculations of chestnut brown, the latter occupy a zone extending from the periphery {{to the middle of}} the whorl, and are separated from each other by a space about equal to the width of the brown spots. On the base, the spiral cords are dotted with maculations of the same color. There are at least two nuclear whorls, apparently smooth. The postnuclear whorls are marked by spiral cords and axial riblets forming tubercles at their junction, thus lending the spiral cords a granulated appearance. Of these cords, 3 occur upon the first, 4 upon the second, 7 upon the third, 8 upon the fourth, and 10 upon the penultimate turn between the periphery and the summit. These spiral cords are separated on all but the body whorl by spaces about equal to the <b>cords</b> in <b>width.</b> On the last turn, however, the sulci are broader and the tuberculated cords are less regular than on the preceding turns. The sutures are slightly constricted. The periphery of the body whorl is decidedly angulated, and marked by a broad spiral cord. The base of the shell is short, slightly rounded, and marked by 14 somewhat flattened spiral cords of somewhat irregular width, increasing slightly in width from the periphery to the umbilical area. The spaces that separate them are also of somewhat irregular width, but in general are almost as wide as the cord. In addition to the spiral sculpture, the base is marked by numerous coarse lines of growth which cut the cords but do not render them tuberculated. The aperture is subcircular. The posterior angle is obtuse;. The outer lip is thin. The columella is strongly curved and reflected over the base as a slight callus at the umbilical area.|$|R
