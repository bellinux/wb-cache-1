This bell is one of 53 full-sized replicas made in France and donated by the United States government to each state. Oregon received its copy on July 4, 1950. Throughout the grounds are native trees and shrubs, including blue spruce, Oregon-grape (the state flower), giant sequoia, <b>coast</b> <b>redwood,</b> Japanese maple, dogwood species, Bradford pear, cherry tree species, English holly, rhododendron, and magnolia tree species. One Douglas-fir tree was grown using a seed that rode aboard Apollo 14 to the Moon in 1971 and was transplanted to the capitol in 1976 from Oregon State University.|$|E

25|$|However, Tharp's {{attempts}} to conserve the giant sequoias were at first met with only limited success. In the 1880s, white settlers seeking {{to create a}} utopian society founded the Kaweah Colony, which sought economic success in trading Sequoia timber. However, Sequoia trees, unlike their <b>coast</b> <b>redwood</b> relatives, were later discovered to splinter easily and therefore were ill-suited to timber harvesting, though thousands of trees were felled before logging operations finally ceased.|$|E
25|$|Ferndale {{is a city}} in Humboldt County, California, United States. Its {{population}} was 1,371 at the 2010 census, down from 1,382 at the 2000 census. The city contains dozens of well-preserved Victorian storefronts and homes. Ferndale is the northern gateway to California's Lost Coast and the city, which is sited {{on the edge of}} a wide plain near the mouth of the Eel River, is also located near the extensive preserves of <b>Coast</b> <b>Redwood</b> forests.|$|E
25|$|The low {{mountains}} of the ecoregion {{are covered by}} highly productive, rain-drenched evergreen forests that are home to the three tallest conifer species in the world: <b>Coast</b> <b>redwood,</b> Coast Douglas-fir, and Sitka spruce. Historically, Sitka spruce forests dominated the fog-shrouded coast, while a mosaic of western redcedar, western hemlock, and seral Douglas-fir blanketed the inland areas. Today, Douglas-fir plantations are prevalent on the intensively logged and managed landscape. Lithology influences land management strategies; slopes underlain by sedimentary rock {{are more susceptible to}} failure following clearcutting and road building than those underlain by volcanic rock.|$|E

25|$|The {{wood from}} {{immature}} trees is less brittle, with recent tests on young plantation-grown trees showing it similar to <b>coast</b> <b>redwood</b> wood in quality. This is resulting in {{some interest in}} cultivating giant sequoia as a very high-yielding timber crop tree, both in California and also in parts of western Europe, where it may grow more efficiently than coast redwoods. In the northwest United States, some entrepreneurs have also begun growing giant sequoias for Christmas trees. Besides these attempts at tree farming, the principal economic uses for giant sequoia today are tourism and horticulture.|$|E
25|$|Before American settlement, Ferndale was a glade {{of giant}} ferns {{reaching}} {{more than six}} feet, surrounded by alder, willow, Sitka spruce, Douglas fir, <b>coast</b> <b>redwood,</b> swampy land and windswept prairies. The area was populated by the southern Wiyot people, centered along the Eel River where they caught lamprey eels, salmon and sturgeon in iris leaf fish nets, collected shellfish along the river and at its mouth, while cultivating only a California species of tobacco. The town was established in 1852 from settlement by Willard Allard, Seth Louis Shaw and his brother Stephen W. Shaw.|$|E
25|$|Sequoiadendron giganteum (giant sequoia; {{also known}} as giant redwood, Sierra redwood, Sierran redwood, Wellingtonia or simply Big Treea {{nickname}} used by John Muir) is the sole living species in the genus Sequoiadendron, and one of three species of coniferous trees known as redwoods, classified in the family Cupressaceae in the subfamily Sequoioideae, together with Sequoia sempervirens (<b>coast</b> <b>redwood)</b> and Metasequoia glyptostroboides (dawn redwood). The common use of the name sequoia generally refers to Sequoiadendron giganteum, which occurs naturally only in groves on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California.|$|E
