40|$|An {{apparatus}} and method for the low-temperature thermo-mechanical training of shape memory alloys (SMA) has been developed. The experimental SMA materials are being evaluated as prototypes for applicability in novel thermal management systems for future <b>cryogenic</b> applications. <b>Alloys</b> providing two-way actuation at cryogenic temperatures are the chief target. The mechanical training regimen {{was focused on}} the controlled movement of rectangular strips, with S-bend configurations, at temperatures as low as 30 K. The custom holding fixture included temperature sensors and a low heat-leak linear actuator with a magnetic coupling. The fixture was mounted to a Gifford-McMahon cryocooler providing up to 25 W of cooling power at 20 K and housed within a custom vacuum chamber. Operations included both training cycles and verification of shape memory movement. The system design and operation are discussed. Results of the training for select prototype alloys are presented...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Cryogenic</b> {{mechanical}} <b>alloying</b> is used {{to incorporate}} a poly(methyl methacrylate-b-isoprene) (MI) diblock copolymer into blends of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polyisoprene (PI). Mechanical milling of the copolymer promotes {{a reduction in the}} molar mass of the M block, as discerned from glass transition temperature measurements performed by thermal calorimetry, and induces chemical cross-linking of the I block, as determined from sol-gel analysis. These effects become more pronounced with increasing milling time. Morphological characterization of PMMA-rich PI/MI/PMMA blends by X-ray and electron microscopies reveals that the characteristic size scale of the minority phase decreases with increasing MI content, as well as milling time. The nanostructural features observed in such blends are retained at relatively high MI concentrations during subsequent melt-pressing. Impact testing demon-strates that the blends become tougher upon addition of the MI copolymer, even at relatively low copolymer concentrations. Blend toughness likewise increases with increasing milling time up to a point, beyond which phase inversion occurs within the ternary blends (the PI becomes continuous) and impact strength sharply decreases...|$|R
40|$|A {{steel alloy}} is {{produced}} by a process which includes using cold rolling at room temperature and subsequent heat treatment at temperatures ranging from 500 C to 650 C. The resulting alloys exhibits excellent strength and toughness characteristics at <b>cryogenic</b> temperatures. This <b>alloy</b> consists essentially of about 10 to 16 percent by weight nickel, to about 1. 0 percent by weight aluminum, and 0 to about 3 percent by weight {{of at least one}} of the following additional elements: copper, lanthanum, niobium, tantalum, titanium, vanadium, yttrium, zirconium and the rare earth metals, with the balance being essentially iron.

40|$|Five {{metallurgical}} treatments {{have been}} tested as means of stabilizing mirrors that are made of aluminum alloy 6061 and are intended for use in <b>cryogenic</b> applications. Aluminum <b>alloy</b> 6061 is favored as a mirror material by many scientists and engineers. Like other alloys, it shrinks upon cool-down from room temperature to cryogenic temperature. This shrinkage degrades the optical quality of the mirror surfaces. Hence, the metallurgical treatments were tested to determine which one could be most effective in minimizing the adverse optical effects of cooldown to cryogenic temperatures. Each of the five metallurgical treatments comprises a multistep process, the steps of which are interspersed with {{the steps of the}} mirror-fabrication process. The five metallurgical-treatment/fabrication. - process combinations were compared {{with each other and with}} a benchmark fabrication process, in which a mirror is made from an alloy blank by (1) symmetrical rough machining, (2) finish machining to within 0. 006 in. (. 0. 15 mm) of final dimensions, and finally (3) diamond turning to a mirror finish...|$|R
40|$|DIN 1. 4110 {{martensitic}} {{stainless steel}} is largely used in the cutlery industry due to its high corrosion resistance associated with high mechanical resistance. However, when this material works under corrosion and wear conditions at the same time, their synergistic effect can accelerate the degradation process of the <b>alloy.</b> <b>Cryogenic</b> heat treatments have been proposed to improve the dimensional stability and mechanical properties, since they minimize the amount of retained austenite. The aim of this work is to study the effect of deep cryogenic heat treatment at - 80 ºC and at - 196 ºC on the corrosion resistance and tribocorrosion behavior of DIN 1. 4110 {{martensitic stainless steel}}. The microstructure, hardness, corrosion resistance and tribocorrosion behavior were evaluated. Although the heat-treated samples presented higher hardness and lower corrosion current density (icorr) compared to samples in spheroidized condition, their material removal under tribocorrosion conditions increased, which demonstrated the synergy between corrosion and wear...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue and {{fracture}} of cylindrical and spherical shells containing a through crack {{and subjected to}} internal pressure or torsion are considered. The stress intensity factor ratios giving the effect of curvature are obtained as functions of a dimensionless shell parameter. By using the conventional plastic strip model the plastic zone size around the crack tip and the crack opening displacement are calculated. The calculated COD values are shown {{to be in good}} agreement with the experimental results. The fracture criterion of critical COD is verified by using the results of the burst tests in titanium and aluminum <b>alloy</b> <b>cryogenic</b> pressure vessels. Modified fatigue crack propagation models taking into account the bending effect in shells are introduced and are applied to the analysis of experimental data obtained from flat plates, and cylindrical shells under axial tension, internal pressure, and torsion. Finally, the paper includes the effect of humidity on the crack growth rate and the effect of load biaxiality on the rupture strength...|$|R
40|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy {{was used to}} study time-temperature-precipitation (TTP) behavior in aluminum-lithium (Al-Li) 2195 alloy. Al-Li 2195 (nominally Al + 4 percent Cu + 1 percent Li + 0. 3 percent Ag + 0. 3 percent Mg + 0. 1 percent Zr) was initially solutionized for 1 hr at 950 F and then stretched 3 percent. Heat treatments were conducted for up to 100 hr at temperatures ranging from 200 to 1, 000 F. TTP diagrams were determined for both matrix and subgrain boundaries. Depending upon heat treatment conditions, precipitate phases (such as GP zone, theta'', theta', theta, delta', T 1, TB, and T 2) {{were found in the}} alloy. The TTP diagrams were applied as a guide to avoid T 1 precipitation at subgrain boundaries, {{as part of an effort}} to improve the <b>alloy's</b> <b>cryogenic</b> fracture toughness (CFT). New understanding of TTP behavior was instrumental in the development of a two-step artificial aging treatment that significantly enhanced CFT in Al-Li 2195...|$|R
40|$|Through- and surface-cracked {{specimens}} of two thicknesses {{were tested in}} uniaxial tension. Surface-cracked specimens were generally found to be stronger than through-cracked specimens with the same crack length. Apparent surface-crack fracture toughness calculated using the Anderson modified Irwin equation remained relatively constant for cracks as deep as 90 percent of the sheet thickness. Subcritical growth of surface cracks was investigated. Comparison of chamber and open air welds showed chamber welds to be slightly tougher. Both methods produced welds with toughness that compared favorably {{with that of the}} parent metal. Weld efficiencies were above 94 percent. Prepared by Lewis Research Center. "November 1971.

40|$|Titanium alloy (Ti- 6 - 4) is {{currently}} being proposed for the manufacturing of pressure vessels (PV) for storage of compressed helium gas, which are mounted inside the ARES I's liquid hydrogen (LH 2) tank. At <b>cryogenic</b> temperature, titanium <b>alloys</b> usually have the highest strength-to-weight ratio property and have been considered as the metallic materials of choice for lightweight PV operating in LH 2 environment. Titanium PV s are also considered as heritage hardware {{because they have been}} used by NASA for the Saturn IV-B rocket s LH 2 tank in the mid 1960 s. However, hydrogen embrittlement is possible if Ti- 6 - 4 alloy is exposed to gaseous hydrogen at certain pressure and temperature during the LH 2 tank filling and draining operations on the launch pad, and during the J 2 X engine burn period for the ARES I s upper stage. Additionally, the fracture toughness and ductility properties of Ti- 6 - 4 are significantly decreased at cryogenic temperature. These factors do not necessary preclude the use of titanium PV in hydrogen or at cryogenic applications; however, their synergistic effects and the material damage tolerance must be accounted for in the mission life assessment for PV s, which are considered as fracture critical hardware. In this paper, an overview of the risk assessment for Ti- 6 - 4 alloy, strategy to control hydrogen embrittlement and brief metallic material trade study for PV operating in LH 2 tank will be presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} is to characterize the fracture behavior and to define the fracture mechanisms for new Al-Li-Cu alloys, with emphasis {{on the role of}} indium additions and <b>cryogenic</b> temperatures. Three <b>alloys</b> were investigated in rolled product form: 2090 baseline and 2090 + indium produced by Reynolds Metals, and commercial AA 2090 -T 81 produced by Alcoa. The experimental 2090 + In alloy exhibited increases in hardness and ultimate strength, but no change in tensile yield strength, compared to the baseline 2090 composition in the unstretched T 6 condition. The reason for this behavior is not understood. Based on hardness and preliminary Kahn Tear fracture experiments, a nominally peak-aged condition was employed for detailed fracture studies. Crack initiation and growth fracture toughness were examined as a function of stress state and microstructure using J(delta a) methods applied to precracked compact tension specimens in the LT orientation. To date, J(delta a) experiments have been limited to 23 C. Alcoa 2090 -T 81 exhibited the highest toughness regardless of stress state. Fracture was accompanied by extensive delamination associated with high angle grain boundaries normal to the fatigue precrack surface and progressed microscopically by a transgranular shear mechanism. In contrast the two peak-aged Reynolds alloys had lower toughness and fracture was intersubgranular without substantial delamination. The influences of cryogenic temperature, microstructure, boundary precipitate structure, and deformation mode in governing the competing fracture mechanisms will be determined in future experiments. Results {{contribute to the development of}} predictive micromechanical models for fracture modes in Al-Li alloys, and to fracture resistant materials...|$|R
40|$|The crack {{initiation}} and growth fracture resistance of Al-Cu-Li and Al-Cu-Li-In alloys were characterized and optimized for cryogenic tank applications. Presently, {{the effects of}} stress state and temperature is being determined on the fracture toughness and fracture mechanisms of commercially available Vintage 3 2090 -T 81 and experimental 2090 +In-T 6. Precracked J-integral specimens of both alloys were tested at ambient and cryogenic temperatures in the plane stress and plane strain conditions. Considering ambient temperature, results showed that 2090 -T 81 exhibited the highest toughness in both plane strain and plane stress conditions. For the plane strain condition, reasonable {{crack initiation}} and growth toughness of 1090 -T 81 {{are associated with a}} significant amount of delamination and transgranular fracture. Plane stress toughnesses were higher and fracture was characterized by shear cracking with minimal delaminations. In comparisons, the fracture behavior of 2090 +In-T 6 is significantly degraded by subgrain boundary precipitation. Toughness is low and characterized by intersubgranular fracture with no delamination in the plane stress or plane strain conditions. Intersubgranular cracking is a low energy event which presumably occurs prior to the onset of slip band cracking. Copious grain boundary precipitation is atypical of commercially available 2090. At <b>cryogenic</b> temperatures, both <b>alloys</b> exhibit increased yield strength, toughness, and amount of delamination and shear cracking. The change in fracture mode of 2090 +In-T 6 from intersubgranular cracking at ambient temperature to a combination of intersubgranular cracking, shear cracking, and delamination at cryogenic temperature is the subject of further investigation...|$|R
