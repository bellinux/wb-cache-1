50|$|Tabulator {{functions}} {{were implemented}} with both mechanical and electrical components. Control panels simplified {{the changing of}} electrical connections for different applications, but changing most tabulator's use still required mechanical changes. The IBM 407 was the first IBM tabulator that did not require such mechanical changes; all the 407's functions were electrically controlled and were completely specified by the application's control panel and <b>carriage</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} of the 407 was directed {{by the use of}} a removable control panel and a <b>carriage</b> <b>tape.</b> Exit hubs (impulse emitting) on the control panel are wired to entry hubs (impulse accepting) for the task to be done (see Wiring of unit record equipment). There are hubs for each card column (at both reading stations), print position, counter digit, and so on. Logic tests were also available.|$|E
50|$|While {{replaced}} by an electronic version later on, line printers initially used a piece of looped physical paper punch tape to control {{the movement of the}} paper while printing. This tape is called a carriage control tape and was mounted on the printer. The length of the carriage control tape had to be exactly the same at the length of one sheet of paper. The looped <b>carriage</b> <b>tape</b> was moved synchronously with the stream of endless paper.|$|E

50|$|The {{operation}} of the 421 was directed {{by the use of}} a removable control panel and a <b>carriage</b> <b>tape.</b> By means of the control panel, any column of the card could be wired to any print column, by means of a wire link (the end terminals of which were inserted into slots in the control panel). When the control panel wiring was complete, the control panel was inserted into the guides in the machine, and a hand-operated lever moved the control panel so that the wire links made contact with corresponding terminals in the machine.|$|E
5000|$|The 402 and 403 were {{primarily}} {{controlled by a}} removable control panel. Additional controls included a <b>carriage</b> control <b>tape</b> and mechanical levers called hammersplits and hammerlocks, that controlled some printing functions. Both the [...] and [...] were considered smaller models of the prior model IBM 405.|$|R
50|$|Many {{printers}} supported ASA {{carriage control}} characters which provided a limited {{degree of control}} over the paper, by specifying how far to advance the paper between printed lines. Various means of providing vertical tabulation were provided, ranging from a paper <b>carriage</b> control <b>tape</b> loop to fully electronic (software-controllable) tab simulation.|$|R
50|$|Like most IBM {{printers}} of the era, the 1403 used fan-folded {{paper with}} perforated edges for tractor feeding. A <b>carriage</b> control <b>tape</b> or, later, a buffer, under program control, specified form length and the form line where printing {{was to begin}} so that paper of various sizes could be used.|$|R
50|$|By {{convention}} {{the position}} {{on a sheet of}} paper where the first print line has to be written was associated with Channel 1. For example, if the first line of text had to always be on physical line 3 for a given form, then the channel 1 hole had to be punched in line 3 of the <b>carriage</b> control <b>tape.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{machine was}} {{programmed}} primarily {{with a plastic}} tape that moved synchronously with the typewriter <b>carriage.</b> Each <b>tape</b> would typically handle one application. The tape mechanism was mounted behind the carriage in the typewriter unit. Further programming was provided in the card machines program drums. Programs were only executed as the machine typed or spaced over a column - tabbing or carriage returning was not recognised.|$|R
50|$|The line {{printers}} had 12 {{sensors to}} recognize 12 independent {{positions on the}} <b>carriage</b> control <b>tape.</b> Each position was called a channel, numbered from 1 to 12. If a hole was punched for a channel, then this hole marked a position that the printer could 'jump to' quickly by advancing until the hole was sensed by the corresponding channel sensor. This is called skip to channel number n.|$|R
50|$|Mainframe {{printers}} {{originally had}} a <b>Carriage</b> control <b>tape,</b> with 12 channels (1 through 9 and A through C) {{that can be}} assigned a fixed position on the page by punching a hole, allowing the printer to skip a variable distance down the page to a fixed location. Newer printers such as the IBM 4248 have done away with the physical tape and use a Forms Control Buffer (FCB) containing {{an image of the}} tape data. Normally only channel 1 is preassigned, {{to the top of the}} page.|$|R
50|$|In {{its basic}} form, a tabulating machine would read one card at a time, print {{portions}} (fields) {{of the card}} on fan-fold paper, possibly rearranged, and add one or more numbers punched on the card {{to one or more}} counters, called accumulators. On early models, the accumulator register dials would be read manually after a card run to get totals. Later models could print totals directly. Cards with a particular punch could be treated as master cards causing different behavior. For example, customer master cards could be merged with sorted cards recording individual items purchased. When read by the tabulating machine to create invoices, the billing address and customer number would be printed from the master card, and then individual items purchased and their price would be printed. When the next master card was detected, the total price would be printed from the accumulator and the page ejected {{to the top of the}} next page, typically using a <b>carriage</b> control <b>tape.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>carriage</b> control <b>tape</b> was a loop of {{punched tape}} {{that was used}} to {{synchronize}} rapid vertical page movement in most IBM and many other line printers from unit record days through the 1970s. The tape loop was as long as the length of a single page. A pin wheel moved the tape accurately using holes {{in the center of the}} tape. A hole punched in one of the other channels represented a particular position on the page. Channel one was typically used to indicate the top of the page and might be the only channel used. Another channel might indicate the summary line on an invoice, enabling rapid skipping to that line. IBM provides a special manual punch that allowed accurate placement of the channel punches. Skipping occurred under computer control, but a form feed switch on the printer control panel allowed a manual skip to the top of the page. The tapes could be easily changed when new, continuously fed forms were loaded into the printer.|$|R
50|$|The Line Casting Control or LCC product {{generated}} paper tapes for Linotype and Intertype automatic typesetters. In {{addition to}} punching a tape containing {{the text to}} be typeset, it turned on a lamp easily seen by the operator {{to show that the}} text on the line being typed could be typesetâ€”it was within justifiable range. The LCC had a four-wheel rotary escapement, and a set of gears between the carriage rack and the escapement, to permit the smallest unit of spacing at the escapement to be quite small at the <b>carriage.</b> The spring-tensioned <b>tape</b> that moved the carriage had far more tension (possibly 20 lbs?) than did a standard Flexowriter.|$|R
