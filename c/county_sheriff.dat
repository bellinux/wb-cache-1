5|$|District constable was {{powerless}} {{to stop the}} violence. In the 1840s, most suburban districts of Philadelphia were policed by elected constables and part-time watchmen.

5|$|In the November 2, 1880 {{election}} for Pima <b>County</b> <b>sheriff,</b> Democrat Shibell ran against Republican Bob Paul, who {{was expected to}} win. Votes arrived as late as November 7, and Shibell was unexpectedly reelected. He immediately appointed Johnny Behan as the new deputy sheriff for eastern Pima County, a job that Wyatt wanted.

5|$|The Democrats' success {{continued}} down the ballot. Meehan {{did not run}} for re-election, and the race for <b>county</b> <b>sheriff</b> pitted two incumbent city councilmen against {{each other for the}} job: Democrat William M. Lennox and Republican Cornelius S. Deegan, Jr. The office of sheriff was another holdover county office. The sheriff, whose job differed from that of the chief of police, was the chief law enforcement officer of the court. Lennox came out ahead, and would hold the job for the next twenty years.|$|E
5|$|The murders {{occurred}} eleven {{days before}} the Maryland Democratic Party's primary election to determine its candidate for the Prince George's <b>County</b> <b>sheriff.</b> As there were no candidates running for sheriff in any other parties, {{the winner of the}} primary election would automatically run unopposed in the general election itself. The incumbent sheriff lost reelection to the union president, who vowed to implement new measures to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.|$|E
5|$|After {{the assault}} on his deputies, El Paso <b>County</b> <b>Sheriff</b> M.F.

Convinced that Bowers had exaggerated the extent of the chaos in the region, Tarsney recommended the withdrawal of troops; Waite concurred. The state militia left Cripple Creek on March 20.|$|E

5|$|After {{the deaths}} of the Gienkes, {{authorities}} began to investigate the cluster of deaths. The <b>county</b> <b>sheriff,</b> Fred Roshon, soon discovered that Martha Wise had signed at a local drug store for a series of purchases of large quantities of arsenic. An autopsy on Lily Gienke confirmed the presence of arsenic in her digestive tract. Brought in for questioning by the sheriff, Wise at first claimed she had obtained the arsenic to kill rats, but eventually confessed that she had used it to poison family members by putting it in water buckets and coffee pots the family drank out of.|$|E
5|$|Behan {{testified that}} when he searched Tom McLaury for a weapon prior to the gunfight, he was not thorough, and that Tom {{might have had a}} pistol hidden in his waistband. Behan's {{testimony}} was significant, since he was a prime witness for the prosecution but had equivocated on this point. Behan's sympathy to the Cowboys was well known, and during the trial he firmly denied he had contributed money to help Ike with his defense costs. However, documents were located in 1997 that showed Behan served as guarantor for a loan to Ike Clanton during the Spicer hearing. Since Wyatt planned to run against Behan for <b>County</b> <b>Sheriff,</b> Behan had an incentive to help convict Wyatt.|$|E
5|$|Behan {{utilized}} his existing {{position and}} his superior political connections to successfully lobby for the position. He also promised Wyatt {{a position as}} his undersheriff if he was appointed over Wyatt. Wyatt withdrew from the political contest and the governor and legislature appointed Behan to the job of Cochise <b>County</b> <b>sheriff</b> on February 10, 1881. Behan reneged on his deal with Earp and appointed Harry Woods as undersheriff instead. Behan said he broke his promise to appoint Earp because Wyatt Earp used Behan's name to threaten Ike Clanton when Wyatt recovered his stolen horse from Clanton.|$|E
