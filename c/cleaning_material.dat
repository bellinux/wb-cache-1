500|$|In {{the medieval}} era {{the river was}} used to {{transport}} Hamstone from the quarry at Ham Hill {{for the construction of}} churches throughout the county. Later, in the 19th century, coal from south Wales, for heating, Bath bricks, bricks and tiles would be carried. Brick making, which had been carried out intermittently in Bridgwater from the 17th century, by the late 18th century had expanded into an industry based on permanent brickyards in the Bridgwater area adjacent to the Parrett. The brick and tile industry made use of the local alluvial clays and the Parrett's coastal trade, using ketches mostly based at Bridgwater to transport their products, which were heavy and bulky, and to bring in coal to heat the kilns. The 19th century industrial revolution opened up mass markets leading to further expansion of the industry, particularly beginning in 1850 when the duty (tax) on bricks was abolished. Brick and tile works, making use of river transport, were opened in the 1840s and 1850s south of Bridgwater at North Petherton and Dunwear, in Bridgwater itself, and downstream at Chilton Trinity, Combwich, Puriton and Pawlett. Numerous brickworks were also opened elsewhere in Somerset, but many of them used the railways to transport their products; some 264 sites are listed in the Somerset Industrial Archaeological Society's Gazetteer of sites. Silt was also dredged from the river over a [...] stretch between Somerset Bridge and Castle Fields, Bridgwater, to make Bath bricks, an early abrasive <b>cleaning</b> <b>material</b> patented in 1827.|$|E

50|$|Exterior {{alterations}} to {{the house}} and its outbuildings for the most part have been associated with the numerous floods of the Delaware River and as such are part of the house's history. There are no visible effects of the various floods on the interior. Damage caused by the flood of 1903 necessitated the replacement of windows and several doors. At the same time, the brick exterior was painted and one story, hipped roof porches were added to the front and west facades. The flood of 1936 damaged the northeast wall of the barn's stone foundation and resulted in the wall's partial replacement with poured concrete. A one story shed roof enclosed porch was added {{to the rear of the}} house in the late nineteenth century, encompassing the cistern. Damage caused by the flood of 1955 necessitated the removal of all three porches. As part of the cleanup from the flood, the exterior paint was removed with an unknown <b>cleaning</b> <b>material.</b> The methodology was changed after workers damaged the surface of the brick on a portion of the east facade of the rear addition. The shed, swept off its foundation and moved several blocks by the 1955 flood, was subsequently returned to its original location. The current one-story porch, glass-enclosed with a metal shed roof, at the rear of the house, is situated on the site of the nineteenth-century porch and a c. 1960 replacement. None of these alterations has greatly affected the integrity of the structure itself or its vernacular Georgian features.|$|E

The reliability of assemblies which have been cleaned with vapor degreasing and spray cleaning can be seriously compromised by residual contaminants leading to solder joint failure, board corrosion, and even electrical failure of the mounted parts.

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} {{cavitation}} is highly discussed and published phenomenon {{not only in}} a negative sense, but in the positive use also. In hydraulic systems the cavitation is undesirable phenomena specific by cavitation wear and noise. These systems operate at ever-increasing operating conditions (pressure and flow). For this reason, this phenomenon occurs in many technical applications. The problem cavitation is very large, so {{it is necessary to}} define the area of scientific interest. Currently, there is an increasing interest in the fields of mathematical and experimental research in hydraulic elements and systems engineering practice. The paper is focused on modelling of shape of cavitation area and influence of air content primarily on the simple geometry of plane nozzle, where the water is flowing. Introduction- the Use of Cavitation Today Cavitation reaches into many branches; it has been understood in a negative sense mainly. The targeted use of the cavitation is over time more frequent in practical aspects, i. e. drilling, cutting material, <b>cleaning,</b> <b>material</b> coating, applications in chemistry, biology, super cavitation use in transport etc...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} an outlook {{on the design}} and application, in the {{cultural}} heritage field, of new tools for diagnostic and cleaning use, based on biocompatible hydrogels and electrochemical sensors, is reported. The use of hydrogels is intriguing {{because it does not}} require liquid treatment that could induce damage on artworks, while electrochemical biosensors not only are easy to prepare, but also can be selective for a specific compound and therefore are suitable for monitoring the cleaning process. In the field of restoration of paper artworks, more efforts have to be done in order to know how to perform the best way for an effective restoration. Rigid Gellan gel, made up of Gellan gum and calcium acetate, was proposed as a paper cleaning treatment, and selective biosensors for substances to be removed from this gel have been obtained by choosing the appropriate enzymes to be immobilized. Using this approach, it is possible to know when the cleanup process will be completed, avoiding lengthy and sometimes unnecessary <b>cleaning</b> <b>material</b> applications...|$|E
30|$|Brown squares plotted in Fig.  4 {{refer to}} the COD values {{determined}} by a separate water purification test at 25  °C using 15 L of artificial waste water under aeration containing 100  mL of milk and porous ceramics (750  g). The COD decreased from 216 to 14.6 and 11.6  mg L− 1 in 1 and 2  weeks, respectively. The latter value reflects water purification rate of 94.6 %. Not to say, water purification rate depends on the mass ratio of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>material</b> (porous ceramics) to the waste water; the higher is the mass ratio, the higher is the purification rate. All the experimental results evidently indicate that the porous ceramics prepared by recycling volcanic ash and waste glass {{could be a very}} effective material for water purification. This porous ceramics will be effectively utilized at different facilities like fish farm, fish reserve, household-water treatment, public waste water treatment, etc. It is noted that porous ceramics had better be cleaned mechanically and washed with clean water to remove the waste sludge or excess sludge so that the porous ceramics could keep its intrinsic high water-cleaning capability.|$|E
