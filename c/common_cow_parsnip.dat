50|$|Heracleum sphondylium, {{commonly}} known as hogweed, <b>common</b> hogweed or <b>cow</b> <b>parsnip,</b> is a herbaceous perennial or biennial plant, in the umbelliferous family Apiaceae that includes fennel, cow parsley, ground elder and giant hogweed. It is native to Europe and Asia. The common name eltrot may also be applied, but is not specific to this species. Umbelliferous plants are so named because of the umbrella-like arrangement of flowers they produce. The North American species Heracleum maximum (also called <b>cow</b> <b>parsnip)</b> is sometimes included as a subspecies of H. sphondylium.|$|R

50|$|The water parsnip (swamp parsnip, Sium suave), western water hemlock (Cicuta douglasii, poison hemlock) {{and spotted}} water hemlock (Cicuta maculata, spotted parsley, spotted cowbane) all have white flowers in large {{compound}} umbels, {{which can lead}} to misidentification. All water hemlock and poison hemlock are highly poisonous, but water parsnip is not. Both have clusters of small white flowers shaped like umbrellas, and have the same habitat near the shore line of lakes and rivers. Water parsnip has leaves only once compound, and water hemlock has leaves which are three times compound. Water hemlock has a large swelling at the stem base, and has bracts at the base of each small flower cluster, not {{at the base of the}} main flower head. The Water parsnip has small bracts at the base of flowers and main flower head as well. Yarrow from the Asteraceae family (Achillea millefolium) also has many small white flowers in a cluster. However the yarrow has feathery looking leaves which are pinnately separated into small narrow segments. The <b>cow</b> <b>parsnips</b> (Heracleum lanatum, Heracleum maximum) are also confused in this group with similar flower groupings. However, the <b>cow</b> <b>parsnips</b> have large, broad leaves, and an unpleasant odour.|$|R
50|$|Many farms grew cabbage, {{cucumbers}}, potatoes, garlic, carrots, beans, beets, turnips, radishes, and pumpkins. In {{summer and}} autumn, {{a great deal}} of fruit were eaten fresh. Pickled cucumbers were used for preparing dishes. Beets and pumpkins were eaten steamed as a dessert. Shschi (cabbage soup) was a traditional soup consisting of cabbage and potatoes cooked in chicken broth with onions and carrots added at the end.

The family vacationed on the Pacific coast in Gearhart, Oregon, where Beard was exposed to Pacific Northwest cuisine. Common ingredients of this cuisine are salmon, shellfish and other fresh seafood; game meats such as moose, elk, or venison; mushrooms, berries, small fruits, potatoes, kale and wild plants such as fiddleheads or young pushki (Heracleum maximum, or <b>cow</b> <b>parsnip).</b>|$|R
50|$|Harsh {{conditions}} at higher altitudes limit tree growth above the tree line, creating an alpine ecosystem. The tree line at Kenai Fjords is between 750 and 1000 ft above sea level. The alpine regions support shrubby grown to alders, devil's club, elderberry, lady fern, <b>cow</b> <b>parsnip</b> and other plants. Herbaceous plants can grow {{in areas with}} better soils, supporting grasses, Nootka lupine, fireweed and other perennial plants. Higher alpine regions support a dwarf shrub community less than 1 ft high, at a very slow rate of growth. Dwarf plants in this region include bog blueberry, partridgefoot, black crowberry and Aleutian mountainheath, {{all of which are}} vulnerable to damage from foot traffic.|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} ten years an {{investigation}} which has been in progress at the Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station gives direct support to the belief that a good producing and highly profitable dairy herd may be built up from a foundation of <b>common</b> <b>cows</b> if the proper methods of breeding, feeding, and management obtain. The offspring resulting from mating a good pure bred dairy sire with <b>common</b> <b>cows,</b> if given generous care, will show greater production in both milk and butterfat than will their dams. The results of this investigation, herein presented in only a preliminary way, will be treated more conclusively in a subsequent publication. Owing to the present increasing demand for dairy products, due to a wider dissemination of knowledge concerning their food value, {{as well as to the}} shortage occasioned by the abnormal conditions confronting the dairy industry, investigations of this character, which tend to point out practical means of increasing both the productivity of the <b>common</b> <b>cow</b> and her offspring, are highly important. According to government reports, there are in the United States over 23, 000, 000 so-called dairy animals, the average production of which is less than half that secured where proper methods of selection, breeding, and feeding are followed. To increase the feeding capacity of our present herds, to stimulate the breeding of better cows, and to further the selection of profitable cows is a goal worthy of the best efforts of the dairy farmer. Any information that will afford guidance to him in the building up of his dairy herd from this foundation of <b>common</b> <b>cows</b> is of immediate value and far reaching importance...|$|R
50|$|The Tatar cuisine {{relies heavily}} on the main {{agricultural}} products of the region - cereals and livestock. Fruits and vegetables were much less developed in the region's agriculture, although {{the relative importance of}} the potato began to increase {{from the end of the}} 19th century. Local vegetables included onions, carrot, horseradish, turnips, pumpkins, beets and, in small quantities, also cucumbers and cabbage. Fruits were mainly grown in orchards on the right bank of Volga, including local apple, cherries, raspberries, and currants. The forests were a source for wild berries, walnuts, hops, <b>cow</b> <b>parsnip,</b> sorrel, mint, and common wild leeks. Mushrooms were not typical in traditional Tatar cooking, and they began to be used only recently, especially among the urban population. Cattle and sheep provided beef and mutton, both equally popular among the Tatars. Horse meat was eaten boiled, salted, and cured. Milk was used primarily in dairy products, such as curds, sour cream, etc. Poultry was widespread in local farms (chickens, geese), and eggs were a popular dish, eaten in various forms. Beekeeping in the forest-steppe belt produced an abundance of honey for local consumption.|$|R
