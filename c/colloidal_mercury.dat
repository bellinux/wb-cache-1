40|$|Effective {{removal of}} mercury {{contamination}} from {{water is a}} complex and difficult problem. In particular, mercury treatment of natural waters is difficult because of the low regulatory standards. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency has established a national ambient water quality standard of 12 parts-per-trillion (ppt), whereas the standard is 1. 8 ppt in the Great Lakes Region. In addition, mercury is typically present in several different forms, but sorption processes are rarely effective {{with more than one}} or two of these forms. To meet the low regulatory discharge limits, a sorption process must be able to address all forms of mercury present in the water. One approach is to apply different sorbents in series depending on the mercury speciation and the regulatory discharge limits. Four new sorbents have been developed to address the variety of mercury species present in industrial discharges and natural waters. Three of these sorbents have been field tested on contaminated creek water at the Y- 12 Plant. Two of these sorbents have demonstrated very high removal efficiencies for soluble mercury species, with mercury concentrations at the outlet of a pilot-scale system less than 12 ppt for as long as six months. The other sorbent tested at the Y- 12 Plant is targeted at <b>colloidal</b> <b>mercury</b> that is not removed by standard sorption or filtration processes. At the Y- 12 Plant, <b>colloidal</b> <b>mercury</b> appears to be associated with iron, so a sorbent that removes mercury-iron complexes in the presence of a magnetic field was evaluated. Field results indicate good removal of this mercury fraction from the Y- 12 waters. In addition, this sorbent is easily regenerated by simply removing the magnetic field and flushing the columns with water. The fourth sorbent is still undergoing laboratory development, but results to date indicate exceptionally high mercury sorption capacity. The sorbent is capable of removing all forms of mercury typically present in natural and industrial waters, including Hg{sup 21 }, elemental mercury, methyl mercury, and <b>colloidal</b> <b>mercury.</b> The process is also showing very fast kinetics, which allows for higher flow rates and smaller treatment units...|$|E

40|$|Mercury {{was widely}} used in U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) weapons facilities, {{resulting}} in {{a broad range of}} mercury-contaminated wastes and wastewaters. Some of the mercury contamination has escaped to the local environment, particularly at the Y- 12 Plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where approximately 330 metric tons of mercury were discharged to the environment between 1953 and 1963 (TN & Associates, 1998). Effective removal of mercury contamination from water is a complex and difficult problem. In particular, mercury treatment of natural waters is difficult because of the low regulatory standards. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency has established a national ambient water quality standard of 12 parts-per-trillion (ppt), whereas the standard is 1. 8 ppt in the Great Lakes Region. In addition, mercury in the environment is typically present in several different forms, but sorption processes are rarely effective with {{more than one or two}} of these forms. To meet the low regulatory discharge limits, an effective sorption process must be able to address all forms of mercury present in the water. One approach is to apply different sorbents in series depending on the mercury speciation and the regulatory discharge limits. ADA Technologies, Inc. has developed four new sorbents to address the variety of mercury species present in industrial discharges and natural waters.

These sorbent technologies, used in tandem or individually depending on the treatment needs, can provide DOE sites with a cost-effective method for reducing mercury concentrations to very low levels mandated by the regulatory community. In addition, the technologies do not generate significant amounts of secondary wastes for disposal. Furthermore, the need for improved water treatment technologies is not unique to the DOE. The new, stringent requirements on mercury concentrations impact other government agencies as well as the private sector. Some of the private-sector industries needing improved methods for removing mercury from water include mining, chloralkali production, chemical processing, and medical waste treatment. The next logical step is to deploy one or more of these sorbents at a contaminated DOE site or at a commercial facility needing improved mercury treatment technologies. A full-scale deployment is planned in fiscal year 2000...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} has involved a geochemical, petrographic, and spectographic study of quicksilver mineralization. It {{has been found}} that cinnabar can be deposited only from alkaline sulphide ion concentration which is, in turn, partially dependent on the alkalinity of the solution. Such alkaline solutions are capable of dissolving silica, but carbonate and alkaline earth ions cannot exist together in such alkaline solutions. Any carbonatization of quicksilver deposits must thus represent a stage in the period of mineralization distinct from the period of cinnabar deposition. However, silica is often deposited syngenetically with cinnabar and the relationship of cinnabar and silica (unlike that of cinnabar and carbonate) is so intimate that the cinnabar occurs, in some places, as an extremely fine dispersion throughout associated silica. Associated with quicksilver mineralizing solutions are small amounts of a number of heavy metals as iron, chromium, manganese, arsenic, antimony, gold, silver, copper, zinc, nickel, germanium, lead, and cobalt. Of these elements, copper, silver, cobalt, lead, and germanium are always differentially concentrated in the cinnabar and such differential concentrations as have been observed are independent of the geographical and geological location of the deposit and are likewise independent of the type of wall rock in which the deposit occurs. The varying shades of cinnabar coloration cannot be attributed to any spectrographically determinable concentrations of any elements nor to the total amount of impurity which is differentially concentrated in the cinnabar. The cinnabar-bearing solutions gain access into the wall rocks through fractures and intergranular voids and the greater part of all cinnabar ores is the result of such open-space filling. When the openings become filled, however, the solutions are quite capable of replacing the adjacent wall rock. If the wall rock is out of equilibrium with the quicksilver mineralizing solutions, the adjustment of equilibrium and consequent precipitation of mercuric sulphide will be quite rapid. Precipitation of cinnabar is caused primarily by relief of pressure, evaporation of solvent, and wall rock reaction. Except in ammoniacal solutions, a decrease in temperature will not cause precipitation. Dilution of solutions causes the precipitation of metacinnabar and <b>colloidal</b> <b>mercury.</b> Such dilution is probably responsible for the native mercury which is a common, minor component of many quicksilver deposits. Acidification will likewise precipitate metacinnabar, but not cinnabar. The infrequent occurrences of metacinnabar can best be explained by near-surface dilution or acidification of hypogene solutions. Insofar as temperature and alkalinity are concerned, pyrite or both pyrite and marcasite could be formed simultaneously with cinnabar of metacinnabar or both. However, where marcasite occurs with cinnabar alone (as is quite commonly the case), the marcasite has probably been deposited separately form the cinnabar. Since cinnabar (rather than metacinnabar) is deposited only from hot alkaline solutions and since oxidized mercury minerals are very rare, supergene deposition of cinnabar must be a very local and a very uncommon occurrence. Some cinnabar darkens rapidly on exposure to sunlight and it is suggested that this darkening may involve the formation of a surficial layer of <b>colloidal</b> <b>mercury</b> in solid solution in the cinnabar. </p...|$|E
