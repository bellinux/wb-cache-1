5|$|During the Bahraini uprising, {{in which}} he led {{numerous}} protests, he has <b>clashed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> political authorities and security forces. As well as criticizing the Bahraini government itself, {{he has also been}} sharply critical of the role of Bahrain's allies, including the United States.|$|E
5|$|Étienne-Maurice Falconet's marble Milo of Croton (1754) secured his {{admission}} to the Académie des beaux-arts, but was later criticized for lack of nobility. The work <b>clashed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> classical ideal requiring a dying hero to express stoic restraint.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{frequently}} <b>clashed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> prison's management {{over the}} mistreatment {{of his fellow}} prisoners. Sometimes he was put into solitary confinement, with one stay lasting 16 months. When Berkman smuggled reports of corruption and brutality outside the prison, resulting in an investigation, {{he was taken to}} the dungeon and put in a straitjacket.|$|E

50|$|When the RNA {{transcript}} reaches 7 nucleotides long, transcription {{enters the}} elongation phase, {{the beginning of}} which is characterised by the collapsing of the DNA bubble and the ejection of TFIIB. This {{is thought to be}} because <b>the</b> nascent RNA <b>clashes</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> B linker helix when it is 6 bases long and upon further elongation to 12-13 bases it will <b>clash</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> B-reader and B-ribbon leading to dissociation. The DNA duplex also <b>clashes</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> B linker above the rudder (caused by rewinding of the DNA into a double helix).|$|R
50|$|The last {{elections}} were in 2012. Normally these elections take place every four years, but the 2017 {{elections were}} postponed {{for a year}} {{in order to avoid}} <b>clashing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 2016 Welsh Assembly election, which itself was postponed by a year to avoid <b>clashing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> previous year's general election.|$|R
5|$|Despite his return, Serevi's {{team did}} not {{do well in the}} first two legs of the 2008–09 World Sevens Series, losing their semi-finals in both to South Africa. He also <b>clashed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Fiji Rugby Union over being left out of player {{selection}} duties. As a result, he was dismissed on 29 January 2009. Iliesa Tanivula took over the post {{for the rest of the}} series.|$|E
5|$|During {{the martial}} law era, Manila became a hot-bed of {{resistance}} activity as youth and student demonstrators repeatedly <b>clashed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{police and military}} which were subservient to the Marcos regime. After decades of resistance, the non-violent People Power Revolution (predecessor to the peaceful-revolutions that toppled the iron-curtain in Europe), ousted the authoritarian Marcos from power.|$|E
5|$|In Britain, the women's {{movement}} was {{allied with the}} Labour party. In the U.S., Betty Friedan emerged from a radical background to take leadership. Radical Women is the oldest socialist feminist organization in the U.S. and is still active. During the Spanish Civil War, Dolores Ibárruri (La Pasionaria) led the Communist Party of Spain. Although she supported equal rights for women, she opposed women fighting {{on the front and}} <b>clashed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> anarcha-feminist Mujeres Libres.|$|E

5|$|A {{dispute over}} the {{composition}} of a Surrey side chosen to play a high-profile game in 1909, after several professional players were omitted for disciplinary reasons, led to an increasingly bitter argument between Crawford and the Surrey authorities. Crawford was told he had no future with the club, and moved to Australia. There, {{he worked as a}} teacher and continued his cricket career with South Australia. This arrangement had a controversial end, when he <b>clashed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> South Australian Cricket Association over money and moved to New Zealand to play for Otago.|$|E
5|$|Air Marshal Murdoch led the RAAF {{through the}} {{build-up}} of Australia's {{commitment to the}} Vietnam War beginning in the mid-1960s. He <b>clashed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Chief of the General Staff (CGS), Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, over the latter's recommendation in mid-1965 to deploy two UH-1 Iroquois helicopters to Vietnam. Wilton believed that both services would benefit from gaining familiarisation with air/ground operations in the region before large-scale commitment of Australian forces. Murdoch dismissed the idea on resourcing grounds, {{despite the fact that}} two-thirds of the RAAF's UH-1 complement had been purchased {{for the express purpose of}} army cooperation.|$|E
5|$|Al-Mu'tasim's reign {{was also}} marked by {{continuous}} warfare. His generals {{led the fight}} against internal rebellions. The two major internal campaigns of the reign were against the long-running Khurramite uprising of Babak Khorramdin in Adharbayjan, which was suppressed by al-Afshin in 835–837, and against Mazyar, the autonomous ruler of Tabaristan, who had <b>clashed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Tahirids and risen up in revolt. Al-Mu'tasim himself led a major campaign in 838 against the Byzantine Empire, with his armies defeating Emperor Theophilos and sacking the city of Amorium. The Amorium campaign was widely celebrated, and became a cornerstone of caliphal propaganda, cementing al-Mu'tasim's reputation as a warrior-caliph.|$|E

5|$|Although Lenin was {{influenced}} by agrarian-socialist Pëtr Tkachëvi, he and the Social-Democrats <b>clashed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Socialist–Revolutionary Party (SR), who were inspired by the defunct People's Freedom Party. Advocating a Narodnik agrarian-socialist platform, the SR emphasised the revolutionary role of the peasant, who in 1881 numbered 75 million, {{in contrast to the}} 1 million urban proletariat in Russia. In contrast, the Marxists believed that the peasant class' primary motivation was to own their land, and that they were capitalists; instead, they saw the proletariat as the revolutionary force to advance socialism.|$|E
5|$|Although no HV attack {{occurred}} in the area during the UNPROFOR mandate, elements of the plan were used by the 3rd Battalion of the PPCLI as the HV <b>clashed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina (ARSK) in the January 1993 Operation Maslenica. The 2nd Battalion of the PPCLI implemented the plan in March 1993 to demonstrate UNPROFOR resolve. The UNPROFOR Sector West deputy commander considered the plan impractical except for deterrence, due to security concerns.|$|E
5|$|As Chief of the Air Staff at {{the onset}} of World WarII, Goble <b>clashed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Federal Government over {{implementation}} of the Empire Air Training Scheme, which he believed would be detrimental to the defence of Australia. He stepped down as leader of the RAAF in early 1940, and {{spent the rest of the}} war in Ottawa as Air Liaison Officer to Canada. Goble died in 1948 at the age of fifty-six, two years after retiring from the military.|$|E

5|$|Cameroon is {{a member}} of both the Commonwealth of Nations and La Francophonie. Its foreign policy closely follows that of its main ally, France (one of its former colonial rulers). Cameroon relies heavily on France for its defence, {{although}} military spending is high in comparison to other sectors of government. Biya has <b>clashed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> government of Nigeria over possession of the oil rich Bakassi peninsula (however, this was resolved with the Greentree Agreement) and with Gabon's president, El Hadj Omar Bongo, over personal rivalries.|$|E
5|$|Chocolina was {{originally}} {{meant to be}} a waitress in Serendipity, but her design impressed Toriyama enough that he expanded her role into something akin to a shop clerk, and the director wrote a new backstory and new dialogue for her. Isamu Kamikokuryo said that though Chocolina's jovial manner and scanty outfit at times <b>clashed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> game's overall atmosphere, he felt she was a good inclusion. Chocolina is voiced by Julie Nathanson in English and Seiko Ueda in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|During {{his year}} of consulship in 519 {{relations}} with the East Roman Empire flourished and the Acacian schism between the Eastern and Western Christian churches was ended. Whilst Eutharic was nominally a statesman, politician and soldier of the Roman Empire, {{he was also an}} Arian, whose views <b>clashed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Catholic majority; as consul enforcing Theoderic's tolerant policy towards the Jewish people, he incurred resentment from the local Catholics, whose traditions were less than tolerant. Following disturbances in Ravenna, where Catholics burnt down a number of synagogues, Eutharic's siding with the Jewish people of Ravenna was reported with resentment in a fragmentary contemporary chronicle.|$|E

5|$|Heber was {{interested}} {{in all aspects of}} Indian life and quickly made friends, both with the local population and with the representatives of non-Anglican churches. Occasionally his easy manner and lavish hospitality <b>clashed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> principles of the more puritan and evangelical of his clergy; one such, Isaac Wilson of the CMS, used a sermon to mount a direct attack on the bishop after what he considered were excessive celebrations following a baptismal service. Wilson was forced to apologise after Heber threatened him with a Consistory court.|$|E
5|$|In April 1784, the Rowans {{and five}} other {{families}} set out for a tract of land on the Long Falls of the Green River that Rowan had purchased before leaving Pennsylvania. The party arrived on May 11, 1784, and constructed a fort which they dubbed Fort Vienna. The fort, then located approximately 100 {{miles from the nearest}} white settlement, is the present-day town of Calhoun. The settlers at Fort Vienna frequently <b>clashed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Shawnee who used the area as a hunting ground. The Rowans would remain at Fort Vienna for six years.|$|E
5|$|Mathias {{was elected}} to the Senate in 1968, {{unseating}} the incumbent Democrat, Daniel Brewster, who twenty years earlier had been his roommate while attending the University of Maryland School of Law. He continued his record as a liberal Republican in the Senate, and frequently <b>clashed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> conservative wing of his party. For a few months in late 1975 and early 1976, Mathias considered running an insurgent presidential campaign in an attempt to stave off the increasing influence of conservative Republicans led by Ronald Reagan.|$|E
