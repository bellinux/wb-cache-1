30|$|We {{argue that}} the public {{perception}} of geothermal energy is affected by several factors. These factors {{may be related to}} the purpose of the project (producing electricity versus furnishing heat to local networks or industries), the <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> with local policies, or the quality of the upstream dialog with the local population. We use several conceptual tools to help shed light on variations in public support to GPs. The distinction we propose between “locally anchored” and “unbound” projects accounts for the way that a project is socially shaped. “Locally anchored” projects are the outcome of a long, concerted dialog between operators and local actors, whereas “unbound” or exogenous ones are developed thanks to a favorable economic and national political context. They are externally managed and often ignore local specificities (Chavot et al. 2019). 3 The social shaping of a project obviously affects its public perception and may elicit diverse reactions: somewhat consensual support in the case of locally anchored projects and criticism and resistance in the case of unbound projects. However, the form and strength of oppositional social movements or support to a project largely depends on the social situation and identity of the actors and stakeholders.|$|E
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this article was first of all to examine how local {{governance}} may conflict with the state framework in the field of energy transition. We have scrutinized the development of deep geothermal projects (GPs) in Alsace and proposed the distinction between locally anchored and unbound project to clarify how relationships between local governance and promoters may affect the social acceptance of a project. In the case of the two locally anchored projects, i.e., Illkirch-Graffenstaden and Wissembourg, upstream discussion and partnerships between operator and municipal government have reinforced the <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> with local policy, which may have facilitated its acceptance by the local population. Conversely, imposing geothermal projects without prior debate, merely invoking energy transition—as has been the case for the unbound projects of La Robertsau and Eckbolsheim—has generated lasting, and sometimes violent misunderstandings between operators, local elected officials and residents. It appears overall that disseminating information upstream and encouraging public input is necessary to facilitate the social acceptance of a project. In any case, a project will be better understood if residents can discuss it, make contributions, and have the opportunity to reject it.|$|E

Contemporary intercultural travel {{is a global}} journey, a circumnavigation {{at the speed of}} light that underwrites all the comings and goings, the departures and arrivals, the transmissions and receptions that are implicit in this title. Hence, From Here to Diversity examines the motivations, characteristics and implications of cultural interactions in their perpetual movement, devoid of spatial or temporal borders, in a dangerous but stimulating indefinition of limits. In the contemporary intercultural dialogue, new voices are making themselves heard, as valuable sources of study: the voices of women; non-occidentals; the non-powerful; forgotten narratives of a past that was as intercultural as the present (after all, what is colonialism other than a perverse form of interculturality?); global entertainment; tourism; oral literature; diaries; mythical narratives; the cinema; ethnography; new teachings, among so many others. Because this project is also intercultural at its source and subject, From Here to Diversity: Globalization and Intercultural Dialogues adds to the <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> by including contributions from the most wide-ranging backgrounds and nationalities, without fear of the alterity that, after all, we propose to study...|$|E

40|$|Compressed Sensing (CS) {{is a novel}} {{technique}} for simultaneous signal sampling and compression based on <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> a sparse representation of signal and a projected dictionary, where ∈R^m× d is the projection matrix and ∈R^d× n is the dictionary.

However, teachers in poor schools in the rural areas generally find it difficult to conduct practical work. An outreach project ‘Science for Rural Communities’ was launched to address this problem. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the nature and <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> and its influence on science teachers’ content knowledge, skills and classroom practice. The research is situated within a qualitative interpretive paradigm and has adopted an evaluative research design, underpinned by grounded theory as a method of analysis. The use of an evaluative framework normally used for curriculum innovation was adapted for the exploration of impact of the teachers’ professional development project. Teachers reported that they benefitted from participation in the project in various ways, such as increased conceptual understanding of science knowledge, improved practical skills and enhanced confidence. However, there were some inconsistencies identified in terms of project intentions and project outcomes.

Situating the study within the field of Practical Theology, Zerfass’ model is used to address the theoretical, contextual and practical aspects of the research problem. In determining what each section and each chapter should contain, the following questions are used as a guide: What is it that the reader should know, recognise and acknowledge after reading the particular section or chapter? How does a section or a chapter contribute towards exploring the stated hypothesis and how are the research steps outlined in Zerfass’ model used to guide the <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project?</b> The research process was initiated with the placing of the "problem" within the context of the UCCSA. Special attention was given to the definition of certain phrases used in UCCSA. Furthermore, the form of government operating in the church was also considered. A comparison was made with other church models. As the researcher’s interest is the election process, the weaknesses in the current election procedures was discussed. A brief biblical perspective on elections was also stated. The findings of this process was that the UCCSA is 'governed' by its understanding and acceptance of the covenant relationship that exists between God and the people as well as between the members of the church. This relationship, therefore, also informs the election processes in the churc...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{architectural}} projects which interpret {{literature as}} program we discuss design reasoning when no routine models {{of problem solving}} apply. We address three aspects of formulation: defining the design charge {{so that it can}} be retrospectively stated independent of the actual proposal; defining a language of formal operations; and defining the intrinsic aims of design that are only intimated through the proposal itself. The <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> is a function of the way in which formal properties interact, and the way in which they sustain analogical or metaphorical relationships to text: how the patterns of subdivision, connection, differentiation, positioning, movement or perception associated with built space relate to textual figures, concepts, structure, or narrative. The possibility of constructing architectural meaning in this way implies an underlying model of space as a morphic language which works primarily through the constitution of generic and significant relationships rather than the combination of previously objectified elements. The gradual articulation of the design charge is mediated by a process of diagramming. Diagrams express as spatial constructions the conditions and concepts abstracted from text; also, they act as notations of constructive operations which are themselves spatial. Diagrams can be abstractive or pictorial, dense or discrete. They document two aspects of an integral process of reasoning: First, an exploration of how concepts, whether directly, analogically or metaphorically transferred from text to shape, may relate to produce a more complex idea; second, how formal properties co-vary and how an emergent design proposal engages and activates a field of formal possibility...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: {{the main}} {{purpose of this article is}} to explore the {{feasibility}} of using the ISM-Interpretive Structural Modeling method to prioritize the phases in the management of the LNG plant construction project. To achieve this goal, the following tasks must be solved in the article: identify the phases of the project at the planning stage that affect the Final Investment Decision (FID); draw up a reachability matrix that defines the interrelations between the phases of the project; split the phases of the project into hierarchical levels; construct a directed graph model and a diagram of the degree of influence and <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> phases facilitating the adoption of strategic management decisions and the coordination of internal and external stakeholders.  Methods: this article is based on the concept of project management and complex systems, which can be investigated using the Interpretive Structural Modeling method, with reference to the specifics of LNG plants. Results: the phases of the project were identified and the relationships between them in the planning phase influencing the FID were established. As a result of modeling, the phases of the project were aligned in a hierarchical structure of the directed graph and positioned on the influence and connectivity diagram, which allows the Project Office of the company to correctly determine priorities in coordination of project participants. Conclusions and Relevance: the present studies show that the method of Interpretive Structural Modeling is effective in identifying and modeling complex relationships between the phases of the project, as a result of which it is possible to build a strategy for the adoption of the Final Investment Decision. This methodology can be extended to subsequent stages of the project. Project managers can prioritize and rank the phases of the project by levels to make effective management decisions to improve the coordination of internal and external stakeholders involved in the implementation of this project. The practical application of the results will improve the management processes between the Project Office and company departments and external stakeholders.  </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{university}} {{has become the}} subject of much critical debate in the social sciences in recent years. While earlier interpretations, such as those of Weber (see Shils, 1973), Parsons (Parsons and Platt, 1973), Bourdieu (1988, 1996), emphasized the autonomy of the university {{within the context of a}} social theory of modernity, the recent appraisals are more critical and call into question the very <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> of modernity in the postmodern and global age. Four debates can be identified. 1. The entrenched liberal critique, which can be called a cultural critique since it is primarily concerned with the university as a medium of cultural reproduction. The liberal idea of the university—associated with the positions of Allan Bloom (1987), who bemoans the attack on the traditional curriculum in the name of diversity, and Russell Jacoby (1987), who regrets the decline of the public intellectual who has disappeared from the university—on the whole looks backwards to the golden age of an earlier university. Despite the different positions within this broad stance that derives from the neo-humanist tradition, the tendency is to see the university in crisis because of the decline of the autonomy of culture, be it the culture of critique or, in its more conservative version, the traditional culture of the canon. 2. The postmodern thesis, associated with Lyotard (1984) and recently restated by Bill Readings (1996), announces the end of the university along with the end of the nation-state. It is claimed that knowledge has lost its emancipatory role and the very notion of universality, or even the very idea of a curriculum, is now impossible, given the fragmentation of knowledge, as in, for instance, the separation of teaching and research. 3. The reflexivity thesis, which is best associated with claims that there is a new mode of knowledge based on a more reflexive relationship between user and producer, offers a less dramatic theory but one nevertheless that announces the obsolescence of the university (Gibbons et al., 1984). As a Mode 2 paradigm around applied knowledge emerges, the university, which is caught up in the more hierarchical and disciplinary-based Mode 1 knowledge production, becomes, it is claimed, increasingly irrelevant to the postfordist economy. 4. The globalization thesis draws attention to the instrumentalization of the university as it embraces market values and information technology. According to various authors, the university is far from irrelevant to capitalism, as the previous thesis would claim, but is in fact fully integrated into it and, as a new manageralism takes over the university, there is a resulting loss of academic freedom (Curie and Newson, 1998; Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff, 1997; Slaughter and Leslie, 1997). This thesis suggests that the {{university has}} become a major player in the global market and in information-based capitalism. What are we to make of these announcements of crisis and even of the decline of the university? I believe a more nuanced interpretation is possible...|$|E

To remedy this detachment, this research focuses on <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> a biomimetic design methodology that employs spatial experience as a means of communication. This design methodology is then applied to three densely urbanized sites through <b>the</b> insertion <b>of</b> a footbridge overpass. Toronto, Singapore, and Perth, are each located in varied climatic regions, providing highly varied biota from which the biomimetic design methodology is based. Each overpass, features five spatial components, each communicating specific environmental status levels taken from the immediate surrounding natural environment. Each overpass is then analyzed in terms <b>of</b> how effectively <b>the</b> five components perform spatial communication. Possible improvements are explored, both in terms of spatial communication, and <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biomimetic language. <b>Projected</b> future applications are considered, and explorations of alternative uses are analyzed...|$|R

40|$|Though Abraham Lincoln {{was not a}} {{political}} philosopher per se, in word and in deed he did grapple with many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most pressing and timeless questions in politics. What is <b>the</b> moral basis <b>of</b> popular sovereignty? What are the proper limits on <b>the</b> will <b>of</b> <b>the</b> majority? When and why should we revere the law? What are we to do when <b>the</b> letter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law {{is at odds with}} what we believe justice requires? How is our devotion to a particular nation related to our commitment to universal ideals? What {{is the best way to}} protect the right to liberty for all people? The contributors to this volume, a methodologically and ideologically diverse group of scholars, examine Lincoln 2 ̆ 7 s responses to these and other ultimate questions in politics. The result is a fascinating portrait of not only Abraham Lincoln but also the promises and paradoxes <b>of</b> liberal democracy. <b>The</b> basic liberal democratic idea is that individual liberty is best secured by a democratic political order that treats all citizens as equals before the law and is governed by the law, with its limits on how the state may treat its citizens and on how citizens may treat one another. Though wonderfully coherent in theory, these ideas prove problematic in real-world politics. <b>The</b> authors <b>of</b> this volume approach Lincoln as <b>the</b> embodiment <b>of</b> this paradox—“naturally antislavery” yet unflinchingly committed to defending proslavery laws; defender <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common man but troubled by <b>the</b> excesses <b>of</b> democracy; devoted to <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> equal natural rights yet unable to imagine a harmonious, interracial democracy. Considering Lincoln as he attempted to work out <b>the</b> meaning and <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liberal democratic <b>project</b> in practice, these authors craft a profile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 16 th president 2 ̆ 7 s political thought from a variety of perspectives and through multiple lenses. Together their essays create the first fully-dimensional portrait of Abraham Lincoln as {{a political}} actor, expressing, addressing, and reframing <b>the</b> perennial questions <b>of</b> liberal democracy for his time and our own.

40|$|Coherentism {{maintains}} that coherent beliefs {{are more likely}} to be true than incoherent beliefs, and that coherent evidence provides more confirmation of a hypothesis when the evidence is made coherent by the explanation provided by that hypothesis. Although probabilistic models of credence ought to be well-suited to justifying such claims, negative results from Bayesian epistemology have suggested otherwise. In this essay we argue that the connection between coherence and confirmation should be understood as a relation mediated by the causal relationships among the evidence and a hypothesis, and we offer a framework for doing so by fitting together probabilistic models <b>of</b> <b>coherence,</b> confirmation, and causation. We show that the causal structure among the evidence and hypothesis is sometimes enough to determine whether <b>the</b> <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evidence boosts confirmation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hypothesis, makes no difference to it, or even reduces it. We also show that, ceteris paribus, it is not <b>the</b> <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evidence that boosts confirmation, but rather <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evidence to <b>the</b> <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evidence conditional on a hypothesis. ...|$|R
