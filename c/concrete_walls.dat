40|$|Abstract: Pumice {{concrete}} and volcanic concrete used in low-rise rural residential building more and more. In {{order to better}} realize the pumice <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> and cinder <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> compressive strength, respectively to make three slices of pumice <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> and three slices of cinder <b>concrete</b> <b>wall,</b> wall compressive experiment was carried out. The experimental {{results showed that the}} compressive strength of pumice <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> and volcanic <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> meet the requirements of the bearing capacity of masonry structure. Foreword Because the low-rise building’s strength request of concrete in rural area is not high, we can use local made lightweight aggregate of lightweight aggregate concrete {{to meet the needs of}} the project. The experiment mainly studies that the wall’s compressive strength of scoria {{concrete and}} pumice <b>concrete.</b> Each <b>wall</b> made 3 pieces, and the concrete grade is CL 15. The measurements of height×width×thickness is 900 × 900 × 250 (mm). General situation of experiment The preparation of lightweight aggregate concrete According to the Technical Specification for Lightweight Aggregate Concrete[1]（in Chinese ）,the scoria concrete and pumice concrete mix proportion of CL 15 as following: cement: 210 kg/m 3, fly-ash: 90 kg/m 3,water: 150 kg/m 3,fine sand: 380 kg/m 3,pumice/scoria: 570 kg/m 3.

40|$|The thermal {{insulation}} properties of foam concrete were investigated {{as a function}} of porosity using the parameters of effective density, the effective heat conductivity and the effective specific heat and a predictive mathematical model determined. Using the model and a foam concrete density of 580 kg/m 3 the theoretically calculated heat conductivity was 0. 145 W/(m•K) compared with the experimental measured value by TPS of 0. 142 W/(m•K). The relative error between the heoretical value and the experimental value was very low at 2. 1 %. The effective specific heat within the model was 967. 05 J/kg•K and the experimental value was 920 J/kg•K, with a relative error of 5. 1 %. The insulation model was then added to a heat transferring model to calculate the temperature field of foam <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> during a fire incident. Finally, the temperature field of a foam <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> and a traditional dense <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> during the same fire incident were calculated and compared. Comparing the temperature field of the foam <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> with the traditional <b>concrete</b> <b>wall,</b> it was found that at a surface temperature in the foam <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> of 1039 ℃at 360 s in the side closed to the fire, the lowest temperature in the foam <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> remained at 20 ℃, for a thickness of 7 mm.

5|$|Populations are dense in {{the higher}} {{mountain}} regions of Tasmania. Widespread throughout the state, their presence is known on King Island, located north-west from Tasmania. The ant prefers rural areas, found in warm, dry, open eucalypt woodlands; the climate provides the ant with isolation and warmth. This environment also produces the ant's food, which includes nectar and invertebrate prey. In suburban areas, this ant is found in native vegetation, and use rockeries, cracks in <b>concrete</b> <b>walls,</b> dry dirt and grass to build nests. One study found suburbs with voluminous vegetation cover such as Mount Nelson, Fern Tree and West Hobart host jack jumper populations, while the heavily urbanised suburbs of North Hobart and Battery Point, do not.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{commenced}} on {{the pilot}} separation plant before a chemical process for separating plutonium from uranium had been selected. In May 1943, DuPont managers {{decided to use}} the bismuth-phosphate process. The plant consisted of six cells, separated from each other and the control room by thick <b>concrete</b> <b>walls.</b> The equipment was operated remotely from the control room. Construction work was completed on 26 November, but the plant could not operate until the reactor started producing irradiated uranium slugs. The first batch was received on 20 December, allowing the first plutonium to be produced in early 1944. By February, the reactor was irradiating a ton of uranium every three days. Over the next five months, the efficiency of the separation process was improved, with the percentage of plutonium recovered increasing from 40 to 90 percent. X-10 operated as a plutonium production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to research activities. By this time, 299 batches of irradiated slugs had been processed.|$|E

The victims undressed in an outer chamber and walked into the gas chamber, which was disguised as a shower facility. Some were even issued soap and a towel. The Zyklon B was delivered by ambulance to the crematoria by a special SS bureau known as the Hygienic Institute. The actual delivery of the gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor. After the doors were shut, SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes {{in the side of the}} chamber. The victims were dead within 20 minutes. Despite the thick <b>concrete</b> <b>walls,</b> screaming and moaning from within could be heard outside. In one failed attempt to muffle the noise, two motorcycle engines were revved up to full throttle nearby, but the sound of yelling could still be heard over the engines.|$|E
5|$|Skyline Drive was {{originally}} lined with miles of chestnut log guardrails. However, the guardrails rotted and were removed in the 1950s and not replaced.

In 1983, the Federal Highway Administration began work to replace several of the original stone walls on the drive with <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> that used the original stone as a veneer. The road was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 28, 1997. On September 22, 2005, Skyline Drive was designated a National Scenic Byway.

5|$|The rivers were as heavily guarded {{as other}} parts of the border. On the Elbe, East Germany {{maintained}} a fleet of about 30 fast patrol boats and West Germany had some 16 customs vessels. The river border was closely watched for escapees, many of whom drowned attempting to cross. Numerous bridges blown up in the closing days of the Second World War remained in ruins, while other surviving bridges were blocked or demolished on the East German side. There were no ferry crossings and river barges were rigorously inspected by the GDR border guards. To prevent escape attempts, the East German river banks were barricaded with a continuous line of metal fences and <b>concrete</b> <b>walls.</b> At one location, Rüterberg on the Elbe, the border fortifications completely surrounded the village and sealed off the inhabitants from the rest of East Germany as well as the West.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{fact that}} Indonesia {{is located in}} the Pacific Ring of Fire in which some big {{earthquakes}} frequently occur has increased concern on the needs for temporary shelter and building safety. Hence, the use of lightweight pre-cast wall becomes one of the ideal choices to fulfill the need of rapid temporary shelter and to increase building safety. This paper reported the investigation of the properties of pre-cast hollow <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> panel with different thickness of partition using self compacting concrete technology. The test of concrete properties consists of compressive strength of mortar, flexural strength of hollow <b>concrete</b> <b>wall,</b> the density of the wall. In addition, the flexural strength is tested on the hollow <b>concrete</b> panel <b>wall</b> with the dimension of 1, 000 x 300 x 120 mm. The result shows that the hollow <b>concrete</b> panel <b>wall</b> satisfies the properties requirement for <b>concrete</b> <b>wall.</b> Moreover, the pre-cast hollow <b>concrete</b> panel <b>wall</b> with the partition thickness of 15 mm is the most optimum dimension of the panel wall and becomes one of appropriate technologies to provide rapid shelter for post disaster area...|$|R
