5|$|The Quebec Agreement {{established}} the <b>Combined</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee {{to coordinate the}} efforts of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. Stimson, Bush and Conant served as the American members of the <b>Combined</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee, Field Marshal Sir John Dill and Colonel J. J. Llewellin were the British members, and C. D. Howe was the Canadian member. Llewellin returned to the United Kingdom at the end of 1943 and was replaced on the committee by Sir Ronald Ian Campbell, who in turn was replaced by the British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Halifax, in early 1945. Dill died in Washington, D.C., in November 1944 and was replaced both as Chief of the British Joint Staff Mission and {{as a member of the}} <b>Combined</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee by Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson.|$|E
5|$|The {{matter of}} {{cooperation}} {{had to be}} taken up at the highest level. In September 1943, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and President Roosevelt negotiated the Quebec Agreement, which reinstated cooperation between Britain, the United States and Canada. Chadwick, Oliphant, Peierls and Simon were summoned to the United States by the director of Tube Alloys, Sir Wallace Akers, to work with the Manhattan Project. The Quebec Agreement established a new <b>Combined</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee to direct the joint project. The Americans disliked Akers, so Chadwick was appointed technical advisor to the <b>Combined</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee, {{and the head of the}} British Mission.|$|E
5|$|By March 1943 Conant {{decided that}} British help would benefit {{some areas of}} the project. James Chadwick and one or two other British {{scientists}} were important enough that the bomb design team at Los Alamos needed them, despite the risk of revealing weapon design secrets. In August 1943 Churchill and Roosevelt negotiated the Quebec Agreement, which resulted in a resumption of cooperation between scientists working on the same problem. Britain, however, agreed to restrictions on data on the building of large-scale production plants necessary for the bomb. The subsequent Hyde Park Agreement in September 1944 extended this cooperation to the postwar period. The Quebec Agreement established the <b>Combined</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee to coordinate the efforts of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. Stimson, Bush and Conant served as the American members of the <b>Combined</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee, Field Marshal Sir John Dill and Colonel J. J. Llewellin were the British members, and C. D.

30|$|As {{the market}} {{competition}} increases, the equilibrium price and producers’ total profit decreased, while the total trading volume, consumers’ surplus {{and social welfare}} increased. The total social welfare increased by 10.2, 10.9 and 12.0 % in Scenario 2, Scenario 3 and Scenario 4, respectively, compared with Scenario 1. Therefore, a single policy (in Scenario 2 and Scenario 3) is Pareto improving compared with the complete monopoly scenario (Scenario 1), and the <b>combined</b> <b>policies</b> (Scenario 4) is Pareto improving compared with a single policy scenario. From the aspect of total social welfare, <b>combined</b> <b>policies</b> will make a better market equilibrium, because {{as the number of}} market participants increases, the market power of each company is undermined and consumers’ market power is enhanced.|$|R

5|$|The Combined Development Trust was {{proposed}} by the <b>Combined</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee on 17 February 1944. The declaration of trust was signed by Churchill and Roosevelt on 13 June 1944. The trustees were approved at the <b>Combined</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee meeting on 19 September 1944. The United States trustees were Groves, who was elected chairman, geologist Charles K. Leith, and George L. Harrison. The British trustees were Sir Charles Hambro, {{the head of the}} British Raw Materials Mission in Washington, D.C., and Frank Lee from HM Treasury. Canada was represented by George C. Bateman, a deputy minister and member of the Canadian Combined Resources Board. Each of the three governments had its own raw materials resources staff, and the Combined Development Trust was a means of coordinating their efforts.|$|E
5|$|The September 1944 Hyde Park Agreement {{extended}} both {{commercial and}} military cooperation into the post-war period.

5|$|Even {{before the}} Quebec Agreement was signed, Akers had already cabled London with {{instructions}} that Chadwick, Peierls, Oliphant and Francis Simon should leave immediately for North America.

5|$|In August 1943, the Quebec Agreement subsumed the British Tube Alloys project {{into the}} Manhattan Project, and {{established}} the <b>Combined</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee {{to control the}} Manhattan Project. A final agreement was spelt out on 20 May 1944. Under it, the Americans would assist {{with the construction of}} a heavy water-moderated nuclear reactor in Canada, and would provide technical assistance with matters such as corrosion and the effects of radiation on materials. They would not provide details about plutonium chemistry or metallurgy, although irradiated uranium slugs were made available for the British to work it out for themselves. A sticking point was the director of the Montreal Laboratory, Hans von Halban, who was a poor administrator, did not work well with the Canadians, and was regarded as a security risk by the Americans. In April 1944 a <b>Combined</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee meeting at Washington agreed that Montreal Laboratory scientists who were not British subjects would leave, and Cockcroft would become the new director of the Montreal Laboratory in May 1944.|$|E
5|$|In September 1942, the {{director}} of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), Vannevar Bush, suggested Styer be appointed director of the Manhattan Project, but Somervell did not wish to lose his services, and engineered the appointment of Groves instead. On 23 September 1942, Styer {{became a member of the}} Military Policy Committee, a group chaired by Bush (with James B. Conant as his alternate) with Rear Admiral William R. Purnell as its third member. As director, Groves was answerable to the Military Policy Committee, which was responsible for the higher direction of the Manhattan Project. When the <b>Combined</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee was formed in September 1943 by the Quebec Agreement, its chairman, Secretary of War Henry Stimson, had Styer appointed as his deputy. Styer also became chairman of its technical subcommittee, which included America's Richard Tolman, Britain's James Chadwick and Canada's C. J. Mackenzie. The technical subcommittee became very influential, as it furnished most of the data on which the <b>Combined</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee based its decisions.|$|E

5|$|The first {{occasion}} was on 8 September 1943, on {{the afternoon}} after Stimson discovered {{that he was the}} chairman. The first meeting established a Technical Subcommittee chaired by Major General Wilhelm D. Styer. Because the Americans did not want Akers on the Technical Subcommittee due to his ICI background, Llewellin nominated Chadwick, whom he also wanted to be Head of the British Mission to the Manhattan Project. The other members were Richard C. Tolman, who was Groves's scientific adviser, and C. J. Mackenzie, the president of the Canadian National Research Council. It was agreed that the Technical Committee could act without consulting the <b>Combined</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee whenever its decision was unanimous. The Technical Subcommittee held its first meeting on 10 September, but negotiations dragged on. The <b>Combined</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee ratified the proposals in December 1943, by which time several British scientists had already commenced working on the Manhattan Project in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{announced}} that the British government concurred {{with the use of}} nuclear weapons against Japan, which would be officially recorded as a decision of the <b>Combined</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee. As the release of information to third parties was also controlled by the Quebec Agreement, discussion then turned to what scientific details would be revealed in the press announcement of the bombing. The meeting also considered what Truman could reveal to Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, at the upcoming Potsdam Conference.|$|E
5|$|Cooperation did {{not long}} survive the war. Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and the Hyde Park Agreement was not binding on {{subsequent}} administrations. In fact, it was physically lost. When Wilson raised {{the matter in}} a <b>Combined</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee meeting in June, the American copy could not be found. The British sent Stimson a photocopy on 18 July 1945. Even then, Groves questioned the document's authenticity until the American copy was located years later in the papers of Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, Jr., Roosevelt's naval aide, apparently misfiled by someone unaware of what Tube Alloys was, who thought {{it had something to}} do with naval guns.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} notions of European spatial planning. Some {{of them are}} {{analysed}} thanks to the theoretical framework of complexity. For us, the notions involved {{in the definition of}} policies are also the product of a political process.

30|$|Furthermore, {{the profit}} of LI in Scenario 3 is only equal to 20.2 % {{of that in}} Scenario 4. As is aforementioned, LT has cost {{advantages}} compared with LI, when TPA is introduced, LT will lower the market price, and other suppliers have to follow the downward trend. LI will lend most regasification capacity to LT to collect the rental income rather than directly import with a relatively high cost. However, given the situation that SOCs will suffer great loss after only the TPA is implemented, it may bring about a social acceptability issue on market reform implementation. If business separation and TPA are both implemented simultaneously in Scenario 4, the profit and production of the new entrant LT is 79.0 % lower than that in Scenario 3. Since DP, LI, LT become independent companies, LI has to keep its market share to ensure its market power. Therefore, LT cannot rent as much capacity as in Scenario 3. Obviously, the investors would prefer the single policy of TPA rather than <b>combined</b> <b>policies.</b> Therefore, from the aspect of diversity of LNG importer and nurturing new market participants, the single policy of TPA will play a more effective role than <b>combined</b> <b>policies.</b>|$|R

5|$|Hans von Halban {{had proved}} to be an unfortunate choice as he was a poor administrator, and did not work well with Mackenzie or the NRC. The Americans saw him as a {{security}} risk, and objected to the French atomic patents claimed by the Paris Group (in association with ICI). In April 1944 a <b>Combined</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee meeting at Washington agreed that Canada would build a heavy water reactor. Scientists who were not British subjects would leave, and Cockcroft became the new director of the Montreal Laboratory in May 1944. E. W. R. Steacie became assistant director and head of the Chemistry division when Paneth left. Volkoff eventually succeeded Placzek as head of the Theoretical Physics division. Halban remained as head of the nuclear physics division.|$|E
5|$|This partly {{resulted}} from the arrest for espionage of British physicist Alan Nunn May, who {{had worked in the}} Montreal Laboratory, in February 1946, while the legislation was being debated. It was but {{the first of a series}} of spy scandals. The arrest of Klaus Fuchs in January 1950, and the June 1951 defection of Donald Maclean, who had served as a British member of the <b>Combined</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, left Americans with a distrust of British security arrangements. The remaining British scientists working in the United States were denied access to papers that they had written just days before.|$|E
5|$|Under the 1943 Quebec Agreement {{with the}} United Kingdom, nuclear weapons {{would not be}} used against another country without mutual consent. Stimson {{therefore}} had to obtain British permission. A meeting of the <b>Combined</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee {{was held at the}} Pentagon on July 4, 1945. Stimson and Vannevar Bush represented the United States; Britain was represented by the head of the British Joint Staff Mission, Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson; and Canada by Clarence D. Howe. In addition, Harvey Bundy, Sir James Chadwick, Groves, Lord Halifax, George L. Harrison, and Roger Makins were all present at the meeting by invitation.|$|E

5|$|At {{the meeting}} with Roosevelt on October 9, 1941, Bush {{advocated}} cooperating with the United Kingdom, and he began corresponding with his British counterpart, Sir John Anderson. But by October 1942, Conant and Bush agreed that a joint project would pose security risks and be more complicated to manage. Roosevelt approved a Military Policy Committee recommendation stating that information given to the British {{should be limited to}} technologies that they were actively working on and should not extend to post-war developments. In July 1943, on a visit to London to learn about British progress on antisubmarine technology, Bush, Stimson and Bundy met with Anderson, Lord Cherwell and Winston Churchill at 10 Downing Street. At the meeting, Churchill forcefully pressed for a renewal of interchange, while Bush defended current policy. Only when he returned to Washington did he discover that Roosevelt had agreed with the British. The Quebec Agreement merged the two atomic bomb projects, creating the <b>Combined</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee with Stimson, Bush and Conant as United States representatives.|$|E
5|$|During the war, all {{the uranium}} from the Congo {{had gone to}} the United States, as had that {{captured}} in Europe by the Alsos Mission, even though some of it passed through British hands. The entire output of the Shinkolobwe mine was contracted to the Combined Development Trust until 1956, but in March 1946 there were fears that the mine might be exhausted in 1947, resulting in a severe uranium shortage. After some negotiation, Groves and Chadwick agreed on a division of uranium ore production, with everything up to March 1946 going to the United States, and supplies being shared equally thereafter. At the <b>Combined</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee meeting on 31 July 1946, the financial arrangements were adjusted. Previously, the two countries had split the costs equally; henceforth each would only pay for what they actually received. Britain was therefore able to secure the uranium it needed without having to outbid the United States, and paid for it in sterling, while receiving reimbursement for the supplies allocated to the United States in dollars, thus easing Britain's dollar shortage.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{negotiations}} {{continued with}} the Americans. Oliver Franks, the British Ambassador to the United States, lodged a formal request on 2 August 1951 {{for use of}} the Nevada Test Site. This was looked upon favourably by the United States Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, {{and the chairman of the}} United States Atomic Energy Commission, Gordon Dean, but opposed by the Robert A. Lovett, the Deputy Secretary of Defense and Robert LeBaron, the Deputy Secretary of Defence for Atomic Energy Affairs. The British government had announced on 7 June 1951 that Donald Maclean, who had served as a British member of the <b>Combined</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, had been a Soviet spy. In view of security concerns, Lovett and LeBaron wanted the tests to be conducted by Americans, with British participation limited to Penney and a few selected British scientists. Truman endorsed this counterproposal on 24 September 1951.|$|E
