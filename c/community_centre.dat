40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationships}} between state and community with respect to public internet access points (PIAPs) in <b>community</b> <b>centres</b> in the UK.

The main argument is that {{while there is a}} government policy and associated initiatives, <b>community</b> <b>centres</b> are appropriating the support government provides for internet access into their own organisations, and acting independently to shape the provision of ICTs at the local level. ...|$|R
