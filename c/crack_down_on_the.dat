25|$|The 2008 Morelia grenade attacks {{took place}} on September 15, 2008, when two hand grenades were thrown onto a crowded plaza, killing ten people and {{injuring}} more than 100. Some see these efforts as intended to sap the morale of government agents assigned to <b>crack</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cartels; others see them {{as an effort to}} let citizens know who is winning the war. At least one dozen Mexican norteño musicians have been murdered. Most of the victims performed what are known as narcocorridos, popular folk songs that tell the stories of the Mexican drug trade—and celebrate its leaders as folk heroes.|$|E

At the end of 1935, however, stressing the need for peace and internal order, Carías began to <b>crack</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opposition press and political activities. Meanwhile, the PNH, at the president's direction, began a propaganda campaign stressing that only the continuance of Carías in office could give the nation continued peace and order.

25|$|Several factors {{contributed to}} the Heungseon Daewongun‘s {{decision}} to <b>crack</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Catholics. Perhaps the most obvious was the lesson provided by China, that it had apparently reaped nothing but hardship and humiliation from its dealing with the western powers - seen most recently in its disastrous defeat during the Second Opium War. No doubt also fresh in the Heungseon Daewongun‘s mind was {{the example of the}} Taiping Rebellion in China, which had been infused with Christian doctrines. 1865 had seen poor harvests in Korea as well as social unrest, which may have contributed to a heightened sensitivity to the foreign creed. The crackdown may also have been related to attempts to combat factional cliques at court, where Christianity had made some inroads.|$|E

25|$|The 1971 war and {{separation}} of East-Pakistan demoralized and shattered the nation. President General Yahya Khan {{handed over the}} political power to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto of the Pakistan Peoples Party. With PPP's coming to power, the democratic socialists and visionaries came to the power {{for the first time}} in the country's history, under a democratic transition. Bhutto made critical decision after dismissing chiefs of army, navy and the air force while authorized home confinement orders for General Yahya Khan and several of his collaborators. He adopted the East-Pakistan Commission's recommendations and authorized large-scale court-martial of army officers tainted for their role in East Pakistan. To keep the country united, Bhutto launched a series of internal intelligence operations to <b>crack</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fissiparous nationalist sentiments and movements in the provinces. Proponents of socialism were supported as part of the internal policies and the PPP faced serious challenges, both on internal and foreign fronts.|$|E

President Zia made strong use of installing high-profile military officers from joint services of joint forces in civilian posts, ranging from central government to provisional governments. Gradually, the socialist influence in the public policies were dismantled disbanded, instead {{a new system of}} capitalism was revived with the introduction of corporatization and Islamization. The populist front against Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto scattered, with far right-wing conservatives allying with General Zia's government and encouraging the military government <b>crack</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pro-Soviet left-wing elements in the country. The left-wing alliance led by Benazir Bhutto was brutalized by Zia who took every mean of aggressive measures against the movement. Further, in his time, secessionist uprisings in Balochistan were put down successfully by the provincial governor, General Rahimuddin Khan. In 1984, Zia held a referendum asking the civil society for the support of his religious programme that received overwhelming support and extended the term of General Zia as country's administrator for next five years.|$|E

25|$|At 12 noon, French Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé {{organised}} {{a crisis}} team, and Charles Pasqua, Interior Minister of France, met his aides. French Prime Minister Édouard Balladur was recalled from his Christmas vacation in Chamonix, France, {{and other government}} officials were recalled from their vacations. Balladur recalled spending his entire afternoon on the telephone, trying to determine {{what was happening and}} feeling confusion. According to Balladur, the Algerian authorities wanted to <b>crack</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> terrorists and that Balladur encountered difficulties discussing the events. At one point, the hijackers dropped the demand for the release of the party leaders. Two hours after the hijacking began, the hijackers asked the captain to depart for Paris so the hijackers could hold a press conference there. The captain could not take off as the aircraft boarding stairs were still attached to the A300 and the Algerian authorities blocked the runway with parked vehicles. When the captain, forced by the hijackers, asked for the removal of the boarding stairs, the Algerian authorities, determined not to give in to any of the hijacker demands, refused. The hijackers announced that they would detonate the aircraft unless the Algerian authorities gave in to the demands.|$|E
25|$|Armed with batons, PAD forces {{surrounded}} Parliament {{and used}} razor wire barricades {{to prevent the}} legislature from meeting to hear Samak's replacement, Somchai Wongsawat, formally announce his policies. The government decided to <b>crack</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> protesters. Police used tear gas but many bullets were fired at the protesters. Many protesters got seriously wounded; some even lost legs, causing over a hundred injuries. One additional PAD leader was killed, claimed by the police, when the bomb in his car went {{off in front of}} the headquarters of the Chart Thai Party, a member of the government coalition. Several protesters lost their hands and legs, although it was not clear whether these injuries were caused by tear gas rounds or the ping-pong grenades. Pornthip Rojanasunand, Director of the Central Institute of Forensic Science, claimed that the loss of one particular PAD member's leg could not have been the result of tear gas usage, but came from a more powerful explosion. After viewing photographs of Angkhana Radappanyawut's injuries, Pornthip Rojanasunand suggested unequivocally that the death was caused by the explosion of a tear gas canister. She also stated that {{there was no need to}} conduct further investigations into the death and injuries of protesters because it became clear that they were caused by weapons of police. Investigations took place while charges against the police and government were filed by many protesters.|$|E
500|$|In December 1975, {{attempting}} {{to circumvent the}} restrictions of the banning order, the BPC declared Biko their honorary president. After Biko and other BCM leaders were banned, a new leadership arose, led by Muntu Myeza and Sathasivian Cooper, who were {{considered part of the}} Durban Moment. Myeza and Cooper organised a BCM demonstration to mark Mozambique's independence from Portuguese colonial rule in 1975. Biko disagreed with this action, correctly predicting that the government would use it to <b>crack</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> BCM. The government arrested around 200 BCM activists, nine of whom were brought before the Supreme Court, accused of subversion by intent. The state claimed that Black Consciousness philosophy was likely to cause [...] "racial confrontation" [...] and therefore threatened public safety. Biko was called as a witness for the defence; he sought to refute the state's accusations by outlining the movement's aims and development. Ultimately, the accused were convicted and imprisoned on Robben Island.|$|E
