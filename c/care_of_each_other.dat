Five groups of short-haired guinea pigs were observed. The guinea pigs were filmed. Next, video records were analysed using ethograms and description of social behaviour between group members. Data record was written down to ethograms every 1 minute for a periof of 24 hours. Observed activities were food intake, resting (including sleep), movement and comfort beahaviour (grooming). Generally, eighteen guinea pigs (in five groups) were observed. Guinea pigs are friendly animals, they create stable and well-organised groups. None aggressive behaviour was observed between group members. Besides small conflicts because of age difference, food or interruption during sleep. The oldest sows were dominant and their place was close to food. It was found out that guinea pigs rested the most (726 minutes, half-day). Food intake made up 590 minutes (41 %) and movement 84 minutes (6 %). More active were younger guinea pigs and boar who was housed with two sows.

50|$|The {{population}} of Locke swelled {{with the growing}} season and harvest. Most of the reclaimed land in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta including Locke was used for cash crops, including asparagus, potato, sweet potatoes, white beans, pears, and apples. There would {{be as many as}} 1000 to 1500 Chinese people living in Locke. Farmhands shared rooms in the boarding houses. Chinese residents living in the homes behind Main Street also took in Chinese farm laborers. Chinese immigrants in Locke started patterns in California agriculture that are continued today in the Sacramento-San Joaquin region, including contracted labor, tenant farming, sharecropping, and the piece wage system. A community garden existed in the back and there was a special oven to make roast pigs on Sundays. Chinese communities congregated in solidarity under difficult labor and social conditions fostered by legislation such as the Chinese Exclusion Act, creating community gardens that maintained cultural relevancy in the form of growing Chinese cabbage, snow peas, leafy vegetables, winter melon, and tomatoes. Baptist missionary Dr. Charles Shepherd would bring in his Chungmei home boys for the pear harvest at the end of July. Life in Locke {{had a great deal of}} accord.

So she had repaired to the parlour, and Miss Mercy, after many remonstrances, had settled her there; and when the good little lady had gone home to her sister's tea, Isabel lay on the sofa, wrapped in her large soft shawl, languidly attempting a little work, and feeling the room dreary, and herself very weak, and forlorn, and desponding, as she thought of James's haggard face, and the fresh anxieties that would be entailed on him if she should become sickly and ailing. The tear gathered on her eyelash as she said to herself, 'I would not exert myself when I could; perhaps now I cannot, when I would give worlds to lighten one of his cares!' And then she saw one little bit of furniture standing awry, in the manner that used so often to worry his fastidious eye; and, in the spirit of doing anything to please him, she moved across the room to rectify it, and then sat down in the large easy chair, wearied by the slight exertion, and becoming even more depressed and hopeless; 'though,' as she told herself, 'all is sure to be ordered well.

In particular, the SFL theory of modality(Halliday 1994) and Engagement (Martin and White 2005) and Goffman’s (1999 [1967]) notion of face were used as tools of analysis. The analysis reveals that participants use a variety of linguistic choices and discourse strategies to maintain face during the discussion of this sensitive topic of xenophobia. The participants make an effort to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>other’s</b> face (desires to be appreciated and left free of any imposition) and keep conflicts to a minimum even when they at times disagree and give incriminatory information about <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> It also reveals that the participants, in addition to maintaining face, also construct and negotiate identities which in turn help build in-group solidarity and provide a sense of belonging to them...|$|R
