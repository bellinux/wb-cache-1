40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} odd components of <b>co-trees</b> and graph embeddings. We show that any graph G must share {{one of the following}} two conditions: (a) for each integer h such that G may be embedded on Sh, the sphere with h handles, there is a spanning tree T in G such that h = 1 2 (β(G) −ω(T)), where β(G) and ω(T) are, respectively, the Betti number of G and the number of components of G − E(T) having odd number of edges; (b) for every spanning tree T of G, there is an orientable embedding of G with exact ω(T) + 1 faces.

Three general methods for writing network equations are described in Chapter 2. 1. They are the node equations, the loop equations, and the hybrid equations. This section outlines another method, the signal flow graph (SFG) method of characterizing a linear network. Consider first the construction of signal flow graphs for linear networks without controlled sources. For all practical networks, the independent voltage sources (E) contain no loops, and the independent current sources (J) contain no cutsets.

40|$|Many {{different}} {{methods have been}} devised to solve the nonlinear systems of equations that model water distribution networks. Probably the most popular is Todini and Pilati's global gradient algorithm (GGA). Given the GGA's success, alternative methods have not aroused much interest. One example is the <b>co-tree</b> method, which requires some cumbersome steps in its implementation. In this paper, a reformulated co-trees method (RCTM) is presented that simplifies the procedure by manipulating the incidence matrix into trapezoidal form: a lower triangular block at the top representing a spanning tree and rectangular block below it representing the corresponding <b>co-tree.</b> This reordering leads to significant efficiencies that make the RCTM competitive with the GGA in certain settings. The new method has some similarities to the loop flows corrections formulation, and it is shown, by application {{to a set of}} eight case study networks with between 932 and 19, 647 pipes and between 848 and 17, 971 nodes, to be between 15 and 82 % faster than the GGA in a setting, such as optimization using evolutionary algorithms, where the methods are applied hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of times to networks with the same topology. It is shown that the key matrix for the RCTM can require as little as 7 % of the storage requirements of the corresponding matrix for the GGA. This can allow for the solution of larger problems by the RCTM than might be possible for the GGA in the same computing environment. Unlike some alternatives to the GGA, the following features make the RCTM attractive: (1) it does not require a set of initial flows that satisfy continuity; (2) {{there is no need to}} identify independent loops or the loops incidence matrix; (3) a spanning tree and <b>co-tree</b> can be found from the incidence matrix without the addition of virtual loops, particularly when multiple reservoirs are present; and (4) it does not require the addition of a ground node and pseudoloops for each demand node and does not require the determination of cut sets. In contrast with the GGA, the RCTM does not require special techniques to handle zero flow problems that can occur when the head loss is modeled by the Hazen-Williams formula (a sufficient condition is given). The paper also (1) reports a comparison of the sparsity of the key RCTM and GGA matrices for the case study networks; (2) shows mathematically why the RCTM and GGA always take the same number of iterations and produce precisely the same iterates; and (3) establishes that the loop flows corrections and the nullspace methods (previously shown by Nielsen to be equivalent) are actually identical to the RCTM.

Gauging is an important issue in computational electromagnetism, whenever discrete vector potentials have to be computed.

40|$|Driven Langevin {{processes}} {{have appeared}} {{in a variety of}} fields due to the relevance of natural phenomena having both deterministic and stochastic effects. The stochastic currents and fluxes in these systems provide a convenient set of observables to describe their non-equilibrium steady states. Here we consider stochastic motion of a (k - 1) -dimensional object, which sweeps out a k-dimensional trajectory, and gives rise to a higher k-dimensional current. By employing the low-temperature (low-noise) limit, we reduce the problem to a discrete Markov chain model on a CW complex, a topological construction which generalizes the notion of a graph. This reduction allows the mean fluxes and currents of the process to be expressed in terms of solutions to the discrete Supersymmetric Fokker-Planck (SFP) equation. Taking the adiabatic limit, we show that generic driving leads to rational quantization of the generated higher dimensional current. The latter is achieved by implementing the recently developed tools, coined the higher-dimensional Kirchhoff tree and <b>co-tree</b> theorems.

With respect to any spanning tree T of G we have a fundamental cycle basis of G formed by the m-n+ 1 fundamental cycles, each one corresponding {{to one of the}} <b>co-tree</b> edges. The problem of determining one such basis minimising the sum of the length of its cycles (MinFCB) is known to be NPhard. Applications exist in organic chemistry, periodic scheduling, and electrical networks. A recent result proves that no polynomial time approximation scheme can exist for MinFCB unless P=NP. The problem of determining a tree with respect to which the longest fundamental cycle is minimum is also NP-hard. When fundamentality is not required, that is when one looks for a basis of the cycle space of the graph, both problems are solvable in polynomial time. Constructive heuristics have been proposed in the literature, which are fast and an obvious first choice for very large instances. However they tend to produce solutions which are far from optimal. We report about on-going research on Local Search approaches for MinFCB. A formulation as Mixed Integer Programming problem is presented and proved effective for obtaining bounds.

This dissertation presents a magnetic vector potential formulation implemented with edge elements to simulate eddy current phenomenon. The additional degree of freedom associated with the magnetic vector potential is fixed with the help of tree and <b>co-tree</b> separation from graph theory. The validity of the method is verified using well-known benchmark problems.;A phenomenological signal inversion scheme is proposed to characterize defect profiles from eddy current probe signals.

40|$|Cyclic {{timetabling}} {{for public}} transportation companies is usually modeled by the periodic event scheduling problem. To deduce a mixed-integer programming formulation, artificial integer variables {{have to be}} introduced. There {{are many ways to}} define these integer variables. We show that the minimal number of integer variables required to encode an instance is achieved by introducing an integer variable for each element of some integral cycle basis. An integral cycle basis consists of |A | − |V | + 1 oriented cycles of a directed graph D = (V, A) that enable any oriented cycle of the directed graph to be expressed as an integer linear combination. The solution times for the originating application vary extremely with different integral cycle bases. However, our computational studies show that the width of integral cycle bases is a good empirical measure for the solution time of the MIP. Clearly, integral cycle bases permit a much wider choice than the former standard approach, in which integer variables are associated with the <b>co-tree</b> arcs of some spanning tree. Hence, to formulate better solvable integer programs, we present algorithms that construct integral cycle bases of small width. To that end, we investigate classes of directed cycle bases that are closely related to integral cycle bases, namely (generalized) fundamental and undirected cycle bases. This gives rise to both, a compact classification of directed cycle bases and notable reductions of running times for cyclic timetabling...|$|E
