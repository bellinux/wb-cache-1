40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVE Estimating the {{incidence}} rate of pressure ulcers and verifying {{factors associated with}} this occurrence in a cohort of hospitalized patients. METHOD This is a cohort study in which the considered outcome was the time until pressure ulcer occurrence. Estimated effect of the variables on the <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>ratio</b> of the outcome was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Variable selection occurred via the Logrank hypothesis test. RESULTS The sample consisted of 442 adults, with 25 incidents of pressure ulcers. Patients with high scores on the Braden scale presented {{a higher risk of}} pressure ulcer incidence when compared to those classified into the low score category. CONCLUSION These results reinforce the importance of using the Braden Scale to assist in identifying patients more likely to develop pressure ulcers...|$|E
40|$|Weight lifting has {{generally}} been proscribed for women with breast-cancer–related lymphedema, preventing them from obtaining the well-established health benefits of weight lifting, including increases in bone density. Methods We performed a randomized, controlled trial of twice-weekly progressive weight lifting involving 141 breast-cancer survivors with stable lymphedema of the arm. The primary outcome was the change in arm and hand swelling at 1 year, as measured through displaced water volume of the affected and unaffected limbs. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of exacerbations of lymphedema, number and severity of lymphedema symptoms, and muscle strength. Participants were required to wear a well-fitted compression garment while weight lifting. Results The proportion of women who had an increase of 5 % or more in limb swelling was similar in the weight-lifting group (11 %) and the control group (12 %) (<b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>ratio,</b> 1. 00; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 88 to 1. 13).

40|$|Measures {{and models}} for causal {{inference}} in cross-sectional studies: arguments for {{the appropriateness of}} the prevalence odds ratio and related logistic regression Michael E Reichenheim 1 *, Evandro SF Coutinho 1, 2 Background: Several papers have discussed which effect measures are appropriate to capture the contrast between exposure groups in cross-sectional studies, and which related multivariate models are suitable. Although some have favored the Prevalence Ratio over the Prevalence Odds Ratio – thus suggesting the use of log-binomial or robust Poisson instead of the logistic regression models – this debate is still far from settled and requires close scrutiny. Discussion: In order to evaluate how accurately true causal parameters such as Incidence Density Ratio (IDR) or the <b>Cumulative</b> <b>Incidence</b> <b>Ratio</b> (CIR) are effectively estimated, this paper presents a series of scenarios in which a researcher happens to find a preset ratio of prevalences in a given cross-sectional study.

40|$|Background Timely and {{accurate}} identification {{of people with}} latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is important for controlling Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). There is no gold standard for diagnosis of LTBI. Screening tests such as interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) and tuberculin skin test (TST) provide indirect and imperfect information. This systematic review compared two types of IGRAs QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-GIT) and T-SPOT.

40|$|Sources of time-variant {{exposure}} to toxic substances are identified and examined for {{their effects on}} the estimation of response. It is shown that only time-averaged target tissue concentrations are required to obtain rigorous risk estimates from the one-hit and multihit models. In contrast, detailed concentration histories need to be retained throughout analyses involving two-event models with intermediate-stage clonal growth advantage (clonal two-stage) and multistage models. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>ratios,</b> based on the exact to time-averaged treatment of concentration time dependencies, are evaluated for substances whose toxic responses exhibit moderate (arsenic) and strong (ethylene dibromide) dependence on time of actual exposure. These ratios reveal that time-averaged dose approximations may lead to several orders of magnitude error in both the multistage and clonal two-stage models if exposure periods are short, and that 3. 4 -fold (arsenic) and 8 -fold (ethylene dibromide) errors still exist even when an actual two-thirds lifetime exposure is averaged over a full lifetime. Finally, the effects of time-variant exposure on risk estimation due to migration and birth-death in an epidemiological setting are examined. A residence time distribution calculation shows that, if these effects are ignored for a population orally exposed to arsenic and characterized by an out-migration rate in excess of 5 %/yr, response errors will exceed an order of magnitude...|$|R

40|$|One {{question}} {{of particular importance}} in phase III HIV vaccine trials is the choice of efficacy measure (EM) to validly and precisely estimate the true vaccinal efficacy. Traditional EMs, based on hazard rate ratio (HRR) or <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>ratio</b> (CIR) are time-sensitive to mode of vaccine action and population heterogeneities. Through Monte-Carlo simulation, the performance of HRR and CIR based EMs are examined across different trial designs and vaccine and population characteristics. A new EM based on log-spline hazard regression (HARE) is proposed. Given that vaccinal properties (mode of action, time-lag, waning) are unknown a priori, appropriate selection of EM is problematic, and HRR and CIR can be unreliable to estimate the true maximum efficacy of candidate products. Non-random sexual mixing can exacerbate biases in HRR and CIR. HARE can offer valid estimation across different modes of vaccine action and in presence of frailty effects, contrary to its traditional counterparts. Our simulation studies highlight the weaknesses of widely used EMs while offering guidelines for trial design and suggesting new avenues for statistical analysis...|$|E

40|$|A {{standard}} {{field trial}} {{was carried out}} to assess {{the effect of a}} commercial Neospora-vaccine based on whole killed tachyzoites (Bovilis–Neoguard, Intervet®) on the abortion rate. Eight hundred and seventy-six cows, over 2. 5 months pregnant, belonging to 25 Costa Rican dairy herds, were used in the analysis. For each cow vaccinated, a cow of the same herd, breed and age category, was selected as control. The period of administration of treatments extended from June to November of 2000. The treatments were administered in two, 5 ml doses 1 month apart, the first dose given between day 75 and 90 of gestation. The incidence of abortion among all treated cows was of 16. 0 % (140 / 876). The treatment specific incidence was 11. 2 % (49 / 438) and 20. 8 % (91 / 438) for the vaccinated and the placebo group, respectively. The prevented fraction by vaccination amounted to 0. 46 (95 % CI: 0. 26, 0. 61), and the <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>ratio</b> for the vaccinated group was 0. 54. The Cox hazard ratio was 0. 51 (95 % CI: 0. 37, 0. 72), meaning that the force of abortion is reduced twice in the vaccinated group.

40|$|OBJECTIVES. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} a nosocomial outbreak of hepatitis A that occurred in the burn treatment center of a referral hospital. METHODS. Retrospective cohort and case-control studies were performed to determine acquisition rates and risk factors for transmission. Adjusted infection rates were calculated by week of exposure. A case-control study was conducted to determine potential mechanisms for nosocomial acquisition. Recently infected health care workers were defined as case patients; exposed, serosusceptible health care workers without infection served as controls. RESULTS. The outbreak of hepatitis A affected 11 health care workers and 1 other burn patient (1 secondary patient case). All 11 health care workers became ill after the admission of a man and his 8 -month-old son who developed hepatitis A while in the hospital. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> risk <b>ratio</b> was elevated for health care workers caring for either the infant or the father during the same week of exposure. The case-control study implicated the behavior of eating on the hospital ward as the single most important risk factor for infection. CONCLUSION. Inadequate hand-washing and subsequent oral contamination appear responsible for the outbreak. Hospitals may witness other institutional outbreaks if health care workers regularly eat on the wards...|$|R

Incidence rates have decreased since the initiation of pneumococcal vaccines, but antibiotic resistant strains continue to emerge and place a heavy burden on healthcare systems to treat such serious resistant infections. This study looks at risk factors that increase a patients probability of contracting a drug resistant strain of S. pneumo. Methods: Confirmed cases of S. pneumo were acquired through the Active Bacterial Core Surveillance program from 2009 - 2012 {{for the state of}} Georgia. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> rates, odds <b>ratios</b> and Pearson’s chi square were calculated to test for trends. Multi-logistic regression model was designed to control for covariates. Antibiotic Susceptibility results were analyzed by resistant profiles through WHONET. Results: <b>Cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> rates have decreased significantly, however antibiotic resistant and multidrug resistant strains have increased. Incidence rates for children less than five and adults over 65 have decreased, however, the burden of disease remains in young to middle adults. Antibiotic resistant strains have shifted from penicillin to erythromycin and cefotaxime. Discussion: Interventions need to be targeted towards young to middle aged adults. Antibiotic stewardship programs should seek uniform guidelines to battle the increasing emergence of multidrug resistant strains...|$|R

The {{purposes of this}} work were to compare baseline lymphedema prevalence in the physical activity and lymphedema (PAL) trial cohort and to subsequently compare {{the effect of the}} weight-lifting intervention on lymphedema, according to four standard diagnostic methods. The PAL trial was a randomized controlled intervention study, involving 295 women who had previously been treated for breast cancer, and evaluated the effect of 12 months of weight lifting on lymphedema status. Four diagnostic methods were used to evaluate lymphedema outcomes: (i) interlimb volume difference through water displacement, (ii) interlimb size difference through sum of arm circumferences, (iii) interlimb impedance ratio using bioimpedance spectroscopy, and (iv) a validated self-report survey. Of the 295 women who participated in the PAL trial, between 22 and 52 % were considered to have lymphedema at baseline according to the four diagnostic criteria used. No between-group differences were noted in the proportion of women who had a change in interlimb volume, interlimb size, interlimb ratio, or survey score of ≥ 5, ≥ 5, ≥ 10 %, and 1 unit, respectively (<b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>ratio</b> at study end for each measure ranged between 0. 6 and 0. 8, with confidence intervals spanning 1. 0). The variation in proportions of women within the PAL trial considered to have lymphoedema at baseline highlights the potential impact of the diagnostic criteria on population surveillance regarding prevalence of this common morbidity of treatment. Importantly though, progressive weight lifting was shown to be safe for women following breast cancer, even for those at risk or with lymphedema, irrespective of the diagnostic criteria used...|$|E
40|$|Intermittent {{delivery}} of piped water {{can lead to}} waterborne illness through contamination in the pipelines or during household storage, use of unsafe water sources during intermittencies, and limited water availability for hygiene. We assessed the association between continuous versus intermittent water supply and waterborne diseases, child mortality, and weight for age in Hubli-Dharwad, India. We conducted a matched cohort study with multivariate matching to identify intermittent and continuous supply areas with comparable characteristics in Hubli-Dharwad. We followed 3, 922 households in 16 neighborhoods with children < 5 y old, with four longitudinal visits over 15 mo (Nov 2010 -Feb 2012) to record caregiver-reported health outcomes (diarrhea, highly credible gastrointestinal illness, bloody diarrhea, typhoid fever, cholera, hepatitis, and deaths of children < 2 y old) and, at the final visit, to measure weight for age for children < 5 y old. We also collected caregiver-reported data on negative control outcomes (cough/cold and scrapes/bruises) to assess potential bias from residual confounding or differential measurement error. Continuous supply had no significant overall association with diarrhea (prevalence ratio [PR] = 0. 93, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 83 - 1. 04, p = 0. 19), bloody diarrhea (PR = 0. 78, 95 % CI: 0. 60 - 1. 01, p = 0. 06), or weight-for-age z-scores (Δz = 0. 01, 95 % CI: - 0. 07 - 0. 09, p = 0. 79) in children < 5 y old. In prespecified subgroup analyses by socioeconomic status, children < 5 y old in lower-income continuous supply households had 37 % lower prevalence of bloody diarrhea (PR = 0. 63, 95 % CI: 0. 46 - 0. 87, p-value for interaction = 0. 03) than lower-income intermittent supply households; in higher-income households, {{there was no significant}} association between continuous versus intermittent supply and child diarrheal illnesses. Continuous supply areas also had 42 % fewer households with ≥ 1 reported case of typhoid fever (<b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>ratio</b> [CIR] = 0. 58, 95 % CI: 0. 41 - 0. 78, p = 0. 001) than intermittent supply areas. There was no significant association with hepatitis, cholera, or mortality of children < 2 y old; however, our results were indicative of lower mortality of children < 2 y old (CIR = 0. 51, 95 % CI: 0. 22 - 1. 07, p = 0. 10) in continuous supply areas. The major limitations of our study were the potential for unmeasured confounding given the observational design and measurement bias from differential reporting of health symptoms given the nonblinded treatment. However, {{there was no significant difference}} in the prevalence of the negative control outcomes between study groups that would suggest undetected confounding or measurement bias. Continuous water supply had no significant overall association with diarrheal disease or ponderal growth in children < 5 y old in Hubli-Dharwad; this might be due to point-of-use water contamination from continuing household storage and exposure to diarrheagenic pathogens through nonwaterborne routes. Continuous supply was associated with lower prevalence of dysentery in children in low-income households and lower typhoid fever incidence, suggesting that intermittently operated piped water systems are a significant transmission mechanism for Salmonella typhi and dysentery-causing pathogens in this urban population, despite centralized water treatment. Continuous supply was associated with reduced transmission, especially in the poorer higher-risk segments of the population...|$|E
40|$|Magister Public Health - MPHBackground: Multidrug {{resistant}} tuberculosis (MDR TB) is {{a growing}} threat globally. The large TB by treating all patients as in-patients in a specialized tuberculosis (TB) hospital. The clinics, increase in the incidence and prevalence of MDR TB in South Africa {{in recent years has}} impacted on the way in which MDR TB is managed within the health services. It became logistically difficult to manage MDR which are run by nurses and/or general medical officers, are then required to manage this more complex form of TB, with limited resources, less experience and assumingly with less MDR TB knowledge. Of particular concern is that shifting of the patient management from specialized TB hospitals to Primary Health Care clinics which might worsen the already poor MDR TB treatment outcomes. There has been minimal assessment of the management of MDR TB at clinic level and hence the comparison of treatment outcomes for those patients initiated on treatment in clinics compared to in-patients in specialized TB hospitals is urgently needed. Aim: To compare the treatment outcomes and the effectiveness of medication regimens provided to MDR TB patients initiated on treatment in specialized TB hospitals as inpatients, to that of MDR TB patients initiated on treatment as outpatients at community clinics within the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Methodology Study Design: A retrospective cohort study was undertaken, as the length of treatment for a MDR TB patient can be for 24 months or longer and this study was based on treatment outcome data. Study Population and sample: The study population was uncomplicated MDR TB patients initiated on treatment in hospitals and clinics from January 2010 to December 2012. The sample comprised of 568 participants that were laboratory confirmed to have MDR TB and had the outcomes of their treatment recorded in an electronic database or a paper register. Data Collection: The researcher collected MDR TB information from standardized MDR TB registers as well as an electronic MDR TB database. Analysis: Data was analyzed comparing the exposed (clinic initiated) and unexposed (hospital initiated) cohorts incidence of 4 key treatment outcomes, namely: successfully treated, failed treatment, died and defaulted treatment. Bivariate analysis (relative and absolute) was done to determine the <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>ratio</b> and cumulative incidence difference and multivariate logistic regression analysis for the adjusted odds ratio to control for confounders and effect modifiers. Ethics: Permission to conduct this research was obtained from the relevant authorities. The confidentiality of the participants as per the Department of Health policy and in adherence to general ethical guidelines was strictly maintained. The study proposal received ethical clearance and approval from the University of the Western Cape Research Committee. Results: All participants within this study received the appropriate treatment as per the MDR TB guidelines. The incidence rate for the main outcomes of this study indicated that successfully treated for the clinic initiated participants was 41 % and 31 % for the hospital initiated participants. 'Defaulted' treatment was 39 % and 41 %, 'failed' treatment 7 % and 13 % and 'died' was 14 % and 16 %, respectively. The clinic initiated participants appeared to have better treatment outcomes on bivariate analysis, however on multivariate analysis, {{there was no difference in}} the treatment outcomes of the clinic initiated participants compared to the hospital initiated participants, and therefore the clinic initiated treatment is seen as effective. The time to treatment initiation for clinic and hospital initiated participants is excessively long for both cohorts, with a median of 29 days, and 37 days respectively. The key findings of note in the multivariate analysis is that the Human Immunodeficiency Virus positive (HIV+) participants provided with antiretrovirals therapy (ART) were, based on adjusted cumulative incidence ratios, 6. 6 times more likely to have a successfully treated outcome (95 % CI 1. 48 - 29. 84), and were 0. 2 times less likely to die (95 % CI 0. 08 - 0. 53). Having a previous cured history of TB and no previous history of TB were 2. 9 times more likely to have a successfully treated outcome (95 % CI 1. 48 - 5. 56) and were 0. 1 times (0. 04 - 0. 38) less likely to fail treatment. An interesting finding was that participants living in the rural districts were 2. 6 times more likely to die. Conclusion: Clinic initiated treatment for uncomplicated MDR TB is as effective as hospital initiated treatment. Also, those provided with ART and those without previous TB or who had a previous bout of TB cured, had better outcomes. Main Recommendations: The Western Cape health department should continue with the decentralization of MDR TB services to the clinics and could safely consider expanding the decentralization to include uncomplicated Pre-extensively drug-resistant TB and Extensively drug-resistant TB patients. Offering ART to HIV+ patients should be mandatory. The delays in the time to treatment initiation of MDR TB need to be further investigate...|$|E

An attempt to reach this objective was exemplified by a vaccination campaign against serogroup C meningococci in the federal state of Santa Catarina, in Brazil. A polysaccharide vaccine against serogroup C meningococci was administered to all individuals between 6 months and 14 years of age in March, 1996, in the municipalities that had the highest incidence of meningococcal disease in the previous year. All cases of the disease due to this serogroup observed in Santa Catarina during a 1 -year period before and after the vaccination were included in the analysis. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> rate <b>ratio</b> was calculated for the unvaccinated compared to the vaccinated area. As a second step, the ratio of this quantity for the period before and after the vaccination, i. e. the ratio of the rate ratios (RRR), was calculated. One minus RRR was used to estimate the vaccine effectiveness. In the general population, the vaccine effectiveness was 74. 3 % (95 % confidence intervals 52. 7 % to 99. 6 %). In children 6 months to 14 years, vaccine effectiveness was 93. 1 % (85. 2 % to 100 %).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Improved {{treatment}} {{has increased the}} life expectancy of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but few studies have {{addressed the issue of}} second cancer in patients treated for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The aims of this study were to determine the incidence and time free of second cancers in this subset of patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated a cohort of 1280 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who were first treated between 1988 and 2003. We utilized the central database of the Gruppo Italiano Studio Linfomi, which includes data on demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, treatment and follow-up of all patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma enrolled in clinical trials. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 51 months, 48 patients had developed a second cancer: 13 hematologic malignancies and 35 solid tumors. The overall standardized <b>incidence</b> <b>ratio</b> in our cohort (with a median age of 58 years) matched that of the general Italian population. The <b>incidence</b> <b>ratio</b> of second tumors was age related, and the age groups 20 - 39 and 40 - 59 years showed an increased risk. Overall, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> of second cancer was 8. 2 % at 15 years.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} differences in the incidence characteristics of coal workers’ pneumoconiosis (CWP) based on data from four large state-owned colliery groups of China, by comparing the <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> rates of CWP. We investigated 87, 904 coal workers from the Datong, Kailuan, Fuxin, and Tiefa Colliery Groups, who were exposed to dust for at least 1 year. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> rate of CWP was calculated with the life-table method and stratified analysis among coal workers with different occupational categories during different years of first dust exposure. Our results showed the <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> rate of Datong was higher than that of any other colliery group among workers with different occupational categories during different years of first dust exposure. For Datong workers who started their dust exposure in the 1970 s, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> rates of CWP among tunneling, mining, combining, and helping workers were 34. 77 %, 10. 20 %, 34. 59 %, and 4. 91 % during the observed time of 34 years, respectively. For those in the 1980 s, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> rates were 32. 29 %, 13. 51 %, 2. 98 %, and 0. 47 %, respectively. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> rates of Fuxin and Tiefa were the lowest. In conclusion, the Datong colliery has the highest <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> rate of CWP among the four studied collieries, followed by Kailuan. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> rates of Fuxin and Tiefa were the lowest. Additional dust-proofing measures for decreasing dust concentrations are still necessary...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{effect of}} {{recovery}} from obesity on cardiovascular risk factors {{is not well}} understood in Japanese children. Methods: We analyzed follow-up data from the Iwata city population-based study of schoolchildren in Japan. The Iwata Board of Education conducted health screenings of children aged 10 and 14 years. A total of 914 children aged 10 years (451 boys and 463 girls, 87. 1 % of all children in the city in 1997) were followed until 14 {{years of age and}} classified by pattern of obesity as Normal, Recovered, Worsened, or Persistent. Results: Of the 914 children, 111 (12 %) were obese at 10 years of age. Of those children, 44 (40 %) were no longer obese at 14 years (ie, Recovered). At follow-up, Recovered boys had the greatest decrease in non-HDL cholesterol (mean ± SE, − 21. 3 ± 3. 6 mg/dL) among the 4 groups, and Recovered girls had a significantly lower level of non-HDL cholesterol (Recovered, 107. 1 ± 5. 4 mg/dL vs. Persistent, 126. 1 ± 4. 5 mg/dL). The Recovered boys also had a significantly higher level of HDL cholesterol at age 14 (Recovered, 67. 2 ± 2. 7 mg/dL vs. Persistent, 53. 3 ± 2. 1 mg/dL). In the Recovered group, 68 % of children who were dyslipidemic at baseline had normal cholesterol levels at age 14. The recovery rate from dyslipidemia was significantly higher in the Recovered group (<b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> rate <b>ratio,</b> 2. 5; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 4 – 4. 7) as compared with the Persistent group. Conclusions: Dyslipidemia was reversed in children who recovered from obesity. Our findings suggest that reducing obesity is beneficial to the health of Japanese schoolchildren.

40|$|Background: Sickness absence is {{a public}} health problem with {{economic}} consequences for individuals and society. Although sickness absence and chronic diseases are correlated, few studies exist concerning the role of chronic disease in all-cause sickness absence. The aim {{was to assess the}} <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> of sickness absence and examine the accompanying burden of chronic diseases among the sick-listed. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed with data from 2008. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> of all-cause sickness absence (≥ 14 days) was calculated based on all newly sick-listed individuals (N = 12, 543). The newly sick-listed sample and a randomized general population sample (n = 7, 984) received a questionnaire (participation rates: 54 % and 50 %). To assess the burden of self-reported chronic diseases, standardized <b>incidence</b> <b>ratios</b> (SIR) were calculated. Results: Estimated one-year <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> was 11. 3 % (95 % CI: 11. 2 – 11. 3), 14. 0 % (13. 9 – 14. 1) for women and 8. 6 % (8. 5 – 8. 6) for men. Gender differences were consistent across all age groups, with highest <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> among women aged 51 – 64 years, 18. 2 % (18. 0 – 18. 5). For women, the burden of chronic disease was significantly higher for nine out of twelve disease groups, corresponding numbers for men were nine out of eleven disease groups (standardized for age and socio-economic status). Neoplastic diseases had the highest SIR with 4. 3 (3. 4 – 5. 2) for women and 4. 2 (2. 8 – 5. 6) for men. For psychiatric and rheumatic diseases the respective SIR’s were 1. 7 for women and 1. 8 for men. The remaining disease groups had an elevated risk of 20 - 60 % (SIR 1. 2 – 1. 6). The risk of reporting a co-morbidity was increased for women (SIR 1. 4 (95 % CI 1. 4 – 1. 5)) and men (SIR 1. 5 (1. 4 – 1. 7)) among the sick-listed. Conclusions: Register data was used to estimate of the <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> of sickness absence in the general population. A higher burden of chronic disease among the newly sick-listed was found. Targeting long-term health problems may be an important public health strategy for reducing sickness absence. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{survival}} {{data that are}} collected from phase III clinical trials on breast cancer, a patient may experience more than one event, including recurrence of the original cancer, new primary cancer and death. Radiation oncologists are often interested in comparing patterns of "local" or "regional" recurrences alone as first events to identify a subgroup of patients {{who need to be}} treated by radiation therapy after surgery. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> function provides estimates of the cumulative probability of locoregional recurrences in the presence of other competing events. A simple version of the Gompertz distribution is proposed to parameterize the <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> function directly.

40|$|Background: Compared {{with the}} general population, {{patients}} with a previous colorectal cancer are at higher risk for a second colorectal cancer, but detailed risk analysis by subsite is scarce. Objective: Our goal {{was to investigate the}} risk of a second cancer in relation to subsite as a basis for planning surveillance strategies,. Design, setting, and patients: This was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively designed, population-based cancer registry (The Netherlands Cancer Registry). Patients with a stage I, II, or III colorectal cancer diagnosed between 1989 and 2008 were included. Main outcome measures: <b>Cumulative</b> <b>incidence,</b> standardized <b>incidence</b> <b>ratio,</b> and absolute excess risk for second primary cancers in subsites of the colon and rectum were estimated for follow-up periods of 2 to 5, 6 to 10, and more than 10 years after the index cancer in patients older than 50 years and in those aged 50 years or younger. Results: A total of 123, 347 patients had a first invasive colorectal cancer diagnosed between 1989 and 2008. Of these, 1849 patients (1. 5 %) had a second colorectal lesion that was found more than 1 year after the initial cancer and diagnosed as a second primary colorectal cancer. In patients older than 50 years, the 20 -year <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> for second cancers was 3. 4 % in the proximal colon, 1. 2 % in the distal colon, and 1. 2 % in the rectum. More than 60 % of second cancers occurred within 5 years after the index cancer. The standardized <b>incidence</b> <b>ratio</b> was highest in the proximal-colon (1. 9; 95 % CI, 1. 8 – 2. 0), followed by the distal-colon (1. 0, 95 % CI, 0. 9 – 1. 1), and the rectum (0. 9, 95 % CI, 0. 8 – 1. 0). The corresponding absolute excess risks per 10 000 person years were 9 in the proximal colon, 0. 1 in the distal colon, and 1 in the rectum. After 5 years of follow-up, elevated risk was observed only in the proximal colon. A similar risk pattern was observed in patients younger than 50 years. The absolute excess risk for a second cancer in the proximal colon increased over time. The proportion of stage III and stage IV second cancers increased from 31 % during the first 5 years of follow-up to 38 % after 10 years of follow-up. Limitations: Limitations of this study included lack of data regarding polypectomy rates and interval of surveillance colonoscopies. Conclusions: Compared {{with the general}} population, individuals with previous colorectal cancer have a higher risk for a second cancer in all subsites of the colon and rectum. Among long-term survivors older than 50 years, risk remains elevated only in the proximal colon. Further studies should be encouraged to develop a suitable surveillance method for aging, high-risk, long-term colorectal cancer survivors...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of dialysis on {{the incidence of}} cancer in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) remains to be clarified. In this study, we evaluated the incidence rate and type of cancer among patients with ESRD, compared to the general population, through a prospective 7 -year follow-up. We also calculated the <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> rate of cancer associated with ESRD, with stratification to control for the competing risk of death. This prospective observational cohort study was conducted using data from a nationwide study on patients with ESRD in Korea. A total of 5, 235 patients, ≥ 18 years old, with ESRD were identified from the national registry as being treated by dialysis between August 2008 and December 2014. The standardized <b>incidence</b> <b>ratio</b> (SIR) and <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> rate of specific cancers were evaluated and compared to the general population. A total of 5, 235 participants were included. During the 7 year observation period, 116 (2. 2 %) participants had been diagnosed as cancer. The SIR of overall cancer was 0. 94 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 72 - 1. 19] and was comparable to the rate for the general population. Although the digestive organs were the most frequent site of a primary site cancer (N = 39, 33. 6 %), the SIR was highest for urinary tract cancer [4. 7, 95 % CI, 2. 42 - 8. 19]. The five year standardized <b>cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> of cancer was higher for females than for males, and for non-diabetic compared to diabetic causes of ESRD.

This study evaluates ECS as a predictor of local, axillary, and supraclavicular recurrence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: International Breast Cancer Study Group Trial VI accrued 1475 eligible pre- and perimenopausal women with node-positive breast cancer who were randomly assigned to receive three to nine courses of classical combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil. ECS status was determined retrospectively in 933 patients based on review of pathology reports. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>incidence</b> and hazard <b>ratios</b> (HRs) were estimated using methods for competing risks analysis. Adjustment factors included treatment group and baseline patient and tumor characteristics. The median follow-up was 14 years.
