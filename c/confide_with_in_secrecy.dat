[...] The pair have not seen each other {{for some time and}} Nancy has changed. Nancy is a punk and more [...] "strong-willed" [...] than Becca remembers her. The actress added that Nancy is nothing like Becca. Her arrival gives Becca someone to <b>confide</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> her relationship with Justin Burton (Chris Fountain).|$|R

She is the first friend that Teru <b>confides</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> her knowledge that she is aware that Kurosaki and DAISY are the same person. Haruka is frequently the first to come to Teru's defense at school, often leading their other friends to join suit. She {{is a member of the}} school's art club, track team, and ghost club.|$|R
5000|$|The word Furtivos has two {{meanings}} in Spanish: people hunting game illegally (poachers) and somebody who harbor secret thoughts. The director's {{intention was to}} imply both. For Borau the film is about secrets and persecution. He explained that before looking for it in a dictionary, he only associated the word furtivo <b>with</b> something done <b>in</b> <b>secrecy.</b> The English translation of the title, Poachers, does not capture the full meaning of the original. Borau explained: [...] "I wanted to show that under Franco, Spain was living a secret life. Virtually everyone in this film is a Furtivo." ...|$|R

The band formed in 2007 and broke up in 2010.The vocalist, Chris Roetter {{claims that the}} band members all felt they should part ways. Before the band disbanded, they {{performed}} on the Scream the Prayer Tour, with multiple acts such as, Haste the Day, Corpus Christi (who Roetter filled in for on Vocals), A Plea for Purging, and Project 86. They have also played <b>with</b> <b>Confide,</b> <b>In</b> Fear and Faith, It Prevails, and LoveHateHero.|$|R
50|$|The {{access to}} a client's data as {{provided}} by the institution in question is usually limited to law enforcement agencies and requires some legal procedures to be accomplished prior to such action (e.g.: court order issued, etc.). This applies to bank account information or medical record. In some cases the data is by definition inaccessible to third parties and should never be revealed; this can include confidential information gathered by attorneys, psychiatrists, psychologists, or priests. One well known result that can seem hard to reconcile {{is that of a}} priest hearing a murder confession, but being unable to reveal details to the authorities. However, {{had it not been for}} the assumed confidentiality, it is unlikely that the information would have been shared in the first place, and to breach this trust would then discourage others from <b>confiding</b> <b>with</b> priests <b>in</b> the future. So, even if justice was served in that particular case (assuming the confession lead to a correct conviction), it would result in fewer people taking part in what is generally considered a beneficial process. This could also be said of a patient sharing information with a psychiatrist, or a client seeking legal advice from a lawyer.|$|R
50|$|Luna Palacios: Red hair in ponytail, 22 {{years old}} and of Mexican descent. She has the power of precognition. She {{is the only one}} among the group who doesn't have control over her power; her visions of the future appear to her either {{randomly}} or shortly before the actual event. She was a bank teller at the Bank of Mexico. There was a robbery at the bank and the getaway car hit and killed Carlita, Luna's little sister. There is often tension between her and Martin due, apparently, to their previous relationship. She is also the one Phillip prefers to <b>confide</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> his more sensitive and personal issues.|$|R
40|$|Upper layer {{wireless}} security {{relies on the}} computational intractability assumption for solving certain number-theoretic problems. These methods can be complemented by techniques that exploit, at the physical layer, the intrinsic properties of the wireless channel and interference. This paper considers communications <b>with</b> intrinsic <b>secrecy</b> <b>in</b> the presence of spatially distributed nodes, namely legitimate users, eavesdroppers, and interferers. We characterize the role of aggregate interference on intrinsic network secrecy, providing insights into regimes in which interference is beneficial for network secrecy...|$|R
40|$|Distributed {{precoding}} has provento {{be capable}} of enhancing the secrecy capacity of the multi-relay wiretap system. An iterative distributed precoding and channel state information (CSI) sharing scheme {{can be used to}} reduce the CSI overhead at each relay node. However, in practical applications, the CSI of each relay node cannot be perfectly known to themselves, especially that of the relay-eavesdropper channels. Thus, partial CSI for the relay-eavesdropper links is assumed, and the corresponding distributed precoding and CSI sharing schemes are investigated. Under the assumption that the average value of the relay-eavesdropper channel is known at each relay node, an extended iterative distributed precoding and CSI sharing scheme is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that with the increase of the power ratio of the constant part to the random part of the relay-eavesdropper channels, the proposed scheme with partial CSI performs increasingly close to the one <b>with</b> perfect CSI <b>in</b> <b>secrecy</b> capacity...|$|R
