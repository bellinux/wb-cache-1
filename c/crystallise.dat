5|$|The stable {{alkali metals}} are all silver-{{coloured}} metals except for caesium, {{which has a}} pale golden tint: {{it is one of}} only three metals that are clearly coloured (the other two being copper and gold). Additionally, the heavy alkaline earth metals calcium, strontium, and barium, as well as the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, are pale yellow, though the colour is much less prominent than it is for caesium. Their lustre tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation. They all <b>crystallise</b> in the body-centered cubic crystal structure, and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited.

5|$|The {{physical}} and chemical properties of the alkali metals can be readily explained by their having an ns1 valence electron configuration, which results in weak metallic bonding. Hence, all the alkali metals are soft and have low densities, melting and boiling points, as well as heats of sublimation, vaporisation, and dissociation. They all <b>crystallise</b> in the body-centered cubic crystal structure, and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited. The ns1 configuration also results in the alkali metals having very large atomic and ionic radii, as well as very high thermal and electrical conductivity. Their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone valence electron in the outermost s-orbital to form the +1 oxidation state, due to the ease of ionising this electron and the very high second ionisation energy. Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group. The chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme radioactivity; thus, the presentation of its properties here is limited. What little is known about francium shows that it is very close in behaviour to caesium, as expected. The physical properties of francium are even sketchier because the bulk element has never been observed; hence any data that may be found in the literature are certainly speculative extrapolations.|$|E

25|$|Thorium {{tetrachloride}} (ThCl4, white, m.p.770°C) {{is produced}} by heating thoria in an organochloride compound such as carbon tetrachloride. The usual method of purification is crystallisation from an aqueous solution and then heating the product above 100°C to dehydrate it. Further purification {{can be achieved by}} subliming it. Its melting and boiling points are respectively 770°C and 921°C. It undergoes a phase transition at 405°C, with a low-temperature α phase and high-temperature β phase. Nevertheless, the β phase usually persists below the transition temperature. Both phases <b>crystallise</b> in the tetragonal crystal system and the structural differences are small.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>crystallising</b> mannitol from different binary mixtures of acetone/water on the resultant physical properties and to determine the effects of any changes on in vitro aerosolisation performance, when the different mannitol crystals were used as a carrier in dry powder inhaler formulations containing salbutamol sulphate. Mannitol particles were <b>crystallised</b> under controlled conditions by dissolving the sugar in water and precipitating the sugar using binary mixtures of acetone/water in different percentages as anti-solvent media. For comparison purposes the physical properties and deposition behaviour of commercially available mannitol were also studied. SEM showed that all <b>crystallised</b> mannitol particles were more elongated than the commercial mannitol. Solid state studies revealed that commercial mannitol and mannitol <b>crystallised</b> using acetone in the presence of 10 - 25 % v/v water as anti-solvent was beta-polymorphic form whereas mannitol <b>crystallised</b> in the presence of a small amount of water (0 - 7. 5 %) was the alpha-form. All the <b>crystallised</b> mannitol samples showed poor flowability. Nevertheless, the powdered <b>crystallised</b> mannitol and commercial samples were blended with salbutamol in the ratio 67. 5 : 1. The aerosolisation performance of the formulations containing the engineered mannitol (evaluated using Multi Stage Liquid Impinger) was considerably better than that of the commercial mannitol formulation (the fine particle fraction was increased from 15. 42 % to 33. 07 - 43. 99 %, for the formulations containing <b>crystallised</b> mannitol). Generally, carriers having a high tapped density and high fraction of fine carrier particles produced a high FPF. The improvement in the DPI performance could be attributed to the presence of elongated carrier particles with smooth surfaces since these are believed to have less adhesive forces between carrier and the drug resulting in easier detachment of the drug during the inhalation...|$|R

However, the Verneuil process could also be used for the production of other stones, including blue sapphire, which simply required ferric oxide to be substituted for chromium oxide, as well as more elaborate ones, such as star sapphires, where titania (titanium dioxide) was added and the boule was kept in the heat longer, allowing needles of rutile to <b>crystallise</b> within it. In 1947, the Linde Air Products division of Union Carbide pioneered the use of the Verneuil process for creating such star sapphires, until production was discontinued in 1974 due to overseas competition.|$|E

500|$|Writing for the TV play progressed through May and June, and on 15 June mixing for Dave Davies' solo LP was {{completed}} (tapes for this record were eventually delivered to Pye and Reprise Records, although it never saw official release). A press release {{announced that the}} Arthur LP was scheduled for a late July release. As Davies and Mitchell completed their script, the Arthur TV play began to <b>crystallise,</b> and British filmmaker Leslie Woodhead was assigned the role of director. By early September production was scheduled to begin, with a planned broadcast of late September, but these plans were continually delayed. As problems with the TV play got progressively worse—and, consequently, distracted the Kinks from completing the post-production of the album—the release dates for both projects were pushed further and further back. In early October Ray Davies moved from Borehamwood back to his old family home on Fortis Green, in Muswell Hill, and travelled to Los Angeles, where he delivered the tapes to Reprise for Arthurs American release. The album's release date was finally set for 10 October, and the Kinks began gearing up for an upcoming US tour to support the album, for which they would depart on 17 October. Shooting for the TV play was eventually set for 1 December. Roy Stonehouse {{was hired as a}} designer, and the casting {{was completed}}; however, the show was cancelled at the last minute when the producer was unable to secure financial backing.

2500|$|Endeavour (depth 2200–2400 m) is a {{northern}} {{segment of the}} Juan de Fuca Ridge which, in turn, {{is part of the}} complex, 80,000km long mid-ocean ridge system spanning the World Ocean. Juan de Fuca Ridge is a medium rate spreading centre (~6cm/yr) forming the divergent boundary between the Pacific (to the west) and the Juan de Fuca (to the east) tectonic plates [...] At these divergent boundaries, convection currents in the mantle rise up as magma, emerge through the rifts as lava, and <b>crystallise</b> as new rock (basalts and gabbro). These processes continually create new ocean crust. Hydrothermal vents, which typically form along these mid-ocean ridges, are fissures from which geothermally heated water flows. The water flowing out of vents is dominantly seawater drawn into the system through the faults, porous sediments, and volcanic rocks. As the cool seawater moves through the sediment and rock towards the hot magma, the water becomes super heated (300-400°C) and rich in dissolved mineral elements (such as sulphur, iron, zinc and copper) from the young ocean crust. When the hot effluent is expelled, it encounters the cold, ambient seawater (about 2°C) minerals precipitate from the element-rich vent water. At the Endeavour segment, a notably vigorous venting area, black smokers form at the high temperature vents,where the effluent is precipitating iron sulphides.This gives the plumeits dark colour and deposits sulphide-minerals, creating chimneys up to 30 m in height. There are 6 known vent fields with distinct morphologies spaced about 2km apart along the axial rift valley of the segment.|$|E
2500|$|This {{starting}} material is finely powdered, {{and placed in}} a container within a Verneuil furnace, with an opening at the bottom through which the powder can escape when the container is vibrated. While the powder is being released, oxygen is supplied into the furnace, and travels with the powder down a narrow tube. This tube is located within a larger tube, into which hydrogen is supplied. At the point where the narrow tube opens into the larger one, combustion occurs, with a flame of at least [...] at its core. As the powder passes through the flame, it melts into small droplets, which fall onto an earthen support rod placed below. The droplets gradually form a sinter cone on the rod, the tip of which is close enough to the core to remain liquid. It is at that tip that the seed crystal eventually forms. As more droplets fall onto the tip, a single crystal, called a boule, starts to form, and the support is slowly moved downward, allowing the base of the boule to <b>crystallise,</b> while its cap always remains liquid. The boule is formed {{in the shape of a}} tapered cylinder, with a diameter broadening away from the base and eventually remaining more or less constant. With a constant supply of powder and withdrawal of the support, very long cylindrical boules can be obtained. Once removed from the furnace and allowed to cool, the boule is split along its vertical axis to relieve internal pressure, otherwise the crystal will be prone to fracture when the stalk is broken due to a vertical parting plane.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the mechanistic evaluation of physicochemical properties of new engineered lactose on aerosolisation performance of salbutamol sulphate (SS) delivered from dry powder inhaler (DPI). Different <b>crystallised</b> lactose particles were obtained from binary mixtures of butanol:acetone. The sieved fractions (63 - 90 μm) of <b>crystallised</b> lactose were characterised in terms of size, shape, flowability, true density and aerosolisation performance (using multiple twin stage impinger (MSLI), Aerolizer ® inhaler device, and salbutamol sulphate as a model drug). Compared to commercial lactose, <b>crystallised</b> lactose particles were less elongated, covered with fine lactose particles, and had a rougher surface morphology. The <b>crystallised</b> lactose powders had a considerably lower bulk and tap density and poorer flow when compared to commercial lactose. Engineered carrier with better flow showed improved drug content homogeneity, reduced amounts of drug " deposited" on the inhaler device and throat, and a smaller drug aerodynamic diameter upon inhalation. Aerodynamic diameter of salbutamol sulphate increased as lactose aerodynamic diameter decreased (linear, R 2 = 0. 9191) and/or as fine particle lactose content increased (linear, R 2 = 0. 8653). Improved drug aerosolisation performance in the case of <b>crystallised</b> lactose particles was attributed to lower drug-carrier adhesion forces due to a rougher surface and higher fine particle content. In conclusion, this work proved that using binary combinations of solvents in crystallisation medium is vital in modification of the physicochemical and micromeritic properties of carriers to achieve a desirable aerosolisation performance from DPI formulations. Among all lactose samples, lactose particles <b>crystallised</b> from pure butanol generated the highest overall DPI formulations desirability. © 2011 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
