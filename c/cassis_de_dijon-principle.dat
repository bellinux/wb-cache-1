40|$|This piece {{specifies}} how {{and where}} the <b>Cassis</b> <b>de</b> Dijon case influenced EU internal market regulation. For a start, I will place the case into the more general context of internal market integration. I will then highlight the different concepts {{that have been developed}} from the <b>Cassis</b> <b>de</b> Dijon case such as e. g. the theory of the information paradigm, the confident consumer, the principle of mutual recognition, and the “new approach”. I will show how each of these concepts has developed in the course of internal market law. Finally, I will conclude that albeit that these principles have come under attack from various sources, the lessons drawn from <b>Cassis</b> <b>de</b> Dijon still remain the yardstick for the evaluation of internal market law today. I have to apologize for the lack of modesty by relying occasionally on works that I have published earlier. I take this contribution also as an opportunity to react to criticism on previous publications of mine by putting them into the more general context of internal market regulation...|$|R

5000|$|The case {{concerned}} {{the sale of}} [...] "Cassis de Dijon" [...] (a type of crème <b>de</b> <b>cassis)</b> in Germany by an importer and retailer (Rewe). Crème <b>de</b> <b>cassis</b> is a blackcurrant liqueur produced in France containing 15% to 20% alcohol by volume. The German government had a law stipulating that products sold as fruit liqueur had to contain at least 25% alcohol by volume. Therefore, the Bundesmonopolverwaltung für Branntwein (a section of the German Federal Ministry of Finance) told Rewe that the <b>Cassis</b> <b>de</b> Dijon might be imported: on the other hand, it advised the importer that its marketing wasn't allowed in Germany. The importer argued that this represented an effect equivalent to a quantitative restriction on trade in breach of article 30 of the Treaty of Rome.|$|R

50|$|The European Court of Justice (ECJ) {{adopted the}} concept {{in its own}} {{jurisprudence}} concerning the free movement of goods within the European Internal Market. The rule has arisen {{in the context of}} Article 34 and 35 TFEU (ex 29 TEC) which prohibit quantitative restrictions on imports and exports (or measures having equivalent effect). In <b>Cassis</b> <b>de</b> Dijon (Rewe-Zentrale AG v Bundesmonopolverwaltung für Branntwein) the ECJ drew a distinction between measures in breach of Article 34 TFEU which were indistinctly applicable as opposed to distinctly applicable.|$|R

The Court held that a regulation applying to both imported and to domestic goods (an [...] "indistinctly applicable measure") that produces an effect equivalent to a quantitative import restriction is an unlawful restriction on the free movement of goods. The case is a seminal judicial interpretation of article 34 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.|$|R
50|$|The Commission also {{relied upon}} the European Court of Justice's <b>Cassis</b> <b>de</b> Dijon jurisprudence, under which member states {{were obliged to}} {{recognise}} goods which had been legally produced in another member state, unless the member state could justify the restriction by reference to a mandatory requirement. Harmonisation would only be used to overcome barriers created by trade restrictions which survived the Cassis mandatory requirements test, and to ensure essential standards {{where there was a}} risk of a race to the bottom.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} how to explain the influence that rulings of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) have on the political decision-making of the EU. It will be argued that a framework developed by Kingdon which follows the garbage can model of Cohen, March and Olson is a good approach to conceptualising this influence. This framework explains political processes in terms of problems, solutions, participants and choice opportunities. In order to illustrate the argument, two famous rulings, Dassonville and <b>Cassis</b> <b>de</b> Dijon, are examined in detail. Both rulings dealt with the same subject but had different impacts on political decision-making. The difference in influence depended on the conditions of the political arena at the time the rulings were given and not on their legal contents...|$|R

5000|$|Legally the Directive did {{not bring}} {{anything}} into EU law that was not already in the EC Treaty as interpreted by the Court of Justice. The [...] "country of origin" [...] principle had been gradually introduced into EU law on the freedom of movement of goods in the <b>Cassis</b> <b>de</b> Dijon case (1979) and into other areas, notably services and establishment, soon after. Secondary legislation cannot introduce rights and obligations that do not already have a basis in the Treaty. In this respect, the original draft of the Services Directive was not a novelty, but a clarification of the case law of the European Court of Justice, and {{a continuation of the}} [...] "country of origin" [...] principle, which had already been applied in the TV Without Frontiers Directive, the Second Banking Directive, the Third Insurance Directive, the E-Commerce Directive and others.|$|R
40|$|EUROPEAN UNION LEGAL INTEGRATION {{has been}} the subject of a rich, {{interdisciplinary}} literature. Studies on the powers of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the dynamics of preliminary rulings, on the constitutionalization of the Treaties, and the reach of EU law into national legal systems, abound. Scholars have theorized that the ECJ and EU law have been a driving force of integration, perhaps the driving force in times of eurosclerosis as suggested by <b>Cassis</b> <b>de</b> Dijon and other famous rulings. It is all the more surprising then that we know little about the professions that partake in the process, the judges, jurists and lawyers that are implicated. We now have many studies on the Commission or the Parliament and on Brussels interest groups. EU policy studies tend to focus on actors within these institutions, only mentioning in passing the relevant jurisprudence in their area. Lega...|$|R

40|$|The EU {{has come}} a long way since its {{foundation}} as the European Economic Community in 1957. Starting out as a purely economic union, the integration process has progressively entered into areas of political, social and cultural concern for the Member States. Meanwhile, the institutionalised ‘logic of the market’ and related harmonisation increasingly lead to tensions not only with varying socio-economic and legal systems, but also with different political and cultural perceptions. ‘Conflicts-law constitutionalism’ aims at developing new awareness for Europe’s conflict constellations and their (re-) interpretation with respect to socio-economic diversity, the social embeddedness of markets and the different regulatory cultures in the Member States. Therefore, it does not only serve for critical re-construction of the integration process but also aims at a ‘third way’ between the defence of the nation state and a quasi-federalist streamlining of Europe`s diversity. This is illustrated with five prominent and topical conflicts where market interests interfere with political, social and cultural preferences: the legendary <b>Cassis</b> <b>de</b> Dijon case, the labour law cases of Viking and Laval, the fully harmonised unfair commercial practices law, the promotion of renewable energies and the regulation of genetically-modified organisms.

40|$|The {{rules on}} {{environmental}} protection were quite late {{included in the}} founding treaties of the former European Communities. After Single European Act entered into force, there was legal basis for the secondary legislation of the European Community and later European Union. In {{the practice of the}} Court of Justice of the European Communities and later Court of Justice of the European Union, the issue of environmental protection has been discussed in several important cases. The Court has established which legal basis is appropriate for enacting regulations and directives related to environment. The case law on relation between the freedom of movement of goods and principle of environmental protection is of special importance because it is necessary to find a balance between these two principles. The judgment in the case of 'Danish bottles' is significant because it has confirmed that environmental protection is one of the primary objectives of the Community. Moreover, it has added one obligatory requirement to the list of exceptions from the freedom of movement of goods, which was mentioned in the case <b>Cassis</b> <b>de</b> Dijon. The ECJ has also discussed principles of environmental protection because by developing this area they were established and now have a significant influence on other EU policies...|$|R
