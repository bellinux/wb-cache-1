40|$|The {{influence}} of the radius of circular ribs on the maximum stresses and deformations of a <b>corner</b> <b>bracket</b> was analyzed. The results were obtained using simulations based on finite element method. Two geometries were studied: with one and two ribs. For each of these two geometries the radius of the ribs was ranged between 3 mm and 9 mm. The parts were subjected to bending. The simulations show that the increase of the ribs radius generates a substantial decrease of the maximum stresses and the maximum deformations...|$|E
40|$|With recent {{innovations}} in technology, 3 D printing {{has become a}} rapidly expanding manufacturing method {{that is being used}} {{for a wide range of}} applications. Their ability to build parts layer by layer instead of cutting away initial material allows this method to have almost no wasted material, creating the potential for a much more efficient, cost effective process. In order to continue the growth of this manufacturing strategy, the performance of 3 D printers need to be enhanced to ensure equal or higher quality of produced parts in comparison to other manufacturing methods that are more commonly used. One important part of the performance that is key to making high quality parts is the stability of the 3 D printer’s frame. No matter how accurate the printer head is, if the structure moves while the printing process is taking place, the accuracy of the produced will be limited. A detailed analysis was done to study the base <b>corner</b> <b>bracket</b> of the 3 D printer structure that is used in the IME labs so that the part can be redesigned to reduce the frames motion. The original design for this part was 3 D printed and was made out of ABS plastic. Even though the part seemed extremely strong, by using simulation software, it was found that while the printer is operating, this part can deform as much as 1. 34 * 10 ^- 4 mm at specific locations. By making this part out of 1 / 82 ̆ 2 steel sheet metal, the same loads would cause this part to deform 1. 54 * 10 ^- 5 mm. This mean that the new design would allow for the deflection of this part to be reduced by almost 90...|$|E
