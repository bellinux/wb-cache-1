5|$|According to the parataxonomic {{system used}} to {{classify}} fossil eggs, Gobioolithus is <b>classified</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> oofamily Gobioolithidae, which, in turn, is <b>classified</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prismatic morphotype (also called the neognath morphotype) of the ornithoid basic type. A cladistic analysis performed by Varricchio and Barta (2015) (pictured below) found Gobioolithus to be a sister taxon to Styloolithus. However, they considered Styloolithus different enough from Gobioolithus to warrant its excluslion from Gobioolithidae.|$|E

5|$|Gorgosaurus is <b>classified</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{theropod}} subfamily Albertosaurinae {{within the}} family Tyrannosauridae. It is most {{closely related to the}} slightly younger Albertosaurus. These are the only two definite albertosaurine genera that have been described, although other undescribed species may exist. Appalachiosaurus was described as a basal tyrannosauroid just outside Tyrannosauridae, although American paleontologist Thomas Holtz published a phylogenetic analysis in 2004 which indicated it was an albertosaurine. More recent, unpublished work by Holtz agrees with the original assessment. All other tyrannosaurid genera, including Daspletosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, are <b>classified</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subfamily Tyrannosaurinae. Compared to the tyrannosaurines, albertosaurines had slender builds, with proportionately smaller, lower skulls and longer bones of the lower leg (tibia) and feet (metatarsals and phalanges).|$|E

5|$|A {{controversy}} exists {{about the}} recognition of Peleinae and Patholopinae, comprising the genera Pelea and Pantholops respectively, as subfamilies. In 2000, American biologist George Schaller and palaeontologist Elisabeth Vrba suggested the inclusion of Pelea in Reduncinae, though the grey rhebok, the sole species of Pelea, is highly different from kobs and reduncines in morphology. Pantholops, earlier <b>classified</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Antilopinae, was later placed in its own subfamily, Pantholopinae. However, molecular and morphological analysis supports the inclusion of Pantholops in Caprinae.|$|E

5|$|According to Takahashi, the inamyloid spores, the diverticulate cap cuticle hyphae, and {{the dark}} pigment in the gill hyphae suggest that the fungus is best <b>classified</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> section Hiemales of the genus Mycena. Because of its {{medium-sized}}, partly collybioid fruit bodies (i.e., small to medium-sized with white spore prints and convex caps, similar to species once placed in the genus Collybia), the white cord-like rhizomorphs, and its distinctly intervenose gills, it has an isolated position within the section.|$|E
