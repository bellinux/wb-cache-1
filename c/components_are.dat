5|$|After an implant is placed, the {{internal}} <b>components</b> <b>are</b> covered {{with either a}} healing abutment, or a cover screw. A healing abutment passes through the mucosa, and the surrounding mucosa is adapted around it. A cover screw is {{flush with the surface}} of the dental implant, and is designed to be completely covered by mucosa. After an integration period, a second surgery is required to reflect the mucosa and place a healing abutment.|$|E
5|$|At {{present the}} group are concentrating on {{amassing}} the many frame components at their Midlands storage facility prior to assembly before relocation to the Great Central Railway in Leicestershire. Due to {{an issue with}} the Frame plates and horn guides being out of true a new set have been manufactured and delivered to Ian Riley & Son (Bury) Ltd (24/4/2014). The remaining <b>components</b> <b>are</b> in a queue with an aim to start frame assembly in late 2014 or 2015.|$|E

50|$|At {{the level}} of the mid-proximal phalanx or mid-metacarpal, the distal <b>component</b> <b>is</b> {{transferred}} to the proximal component. The tendons of the distal <b>component</b> <b>are</b> preserved {{as the rest of the}} distal <b>component</b> <b>is</b> amputated. The neurovascular bundle which supplies the distal <b>component</b> <b>is</b> reserved and transferred proximally.|$|R
50|$|In many {{epicyclic}} gearing systems, {{one of these}} three basic <b>components</b> <b>is</b> held stationary; {{one of the two}} remaining <b>components</b> <b>is</b> an input, providing power to the system, while the last <b>component</b> <b>is</b> an output, receiving power from the system. The ratio of input rotation to output rotation is dependent upon the number of teeth in each gear, and upon which <b>component</b> <b>is</b> held stationary.|$|R
5|$|Gene {{expression}} in prokaryotes {{is influenced by}} an RNA-based system similar in some respects to RNAi. Here, RNA-encoding genes control mRNA abundance or translation by producing a complementary RNA that anneals to an mRNA. However these regulatory RNAs are not {{generally considered to be}} analogous to miRNAs because the dicer enzyme is not involved. It has been suggested that CRISPR interference systems in prokaryotes are analogous to eukaryotic RNA interference systems, although none of the protein <b>components</b> <b>are</b> orthologous.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{nutritional}} {{significance of these}} components is defined not only by their structure or macronutrient category, {{but also by the}} physiological role that each nutrient serves. As a quantitatively minor presence within milk, MFGM likely contributes little to energy production, but its constituents may confer structural and functional benefits. Many of these nutrients are known to play important functional roles within the gut, brain, and elsewhere in the body; the functions of other <b>components</b> <b>are</b> still being elucidated.|$|E
5|$|Neon plasma has {{the most}} intense light {{discharge}} at normal voltages and currents of all the noble gases. The average color of this light to the human eye is red-orange due to many lines in this range; it also contains a strong green line which is hidden, unless the visual <b>components</b> <b>are</b> dispersed by a spectroscope.|$|E

In the power of adapter, even harmonic <b>component</b> <b>is</b> extremeley less and only the odd harmonics <b>component</b> <b>is</b> found. When analysed THD of leaking sound open-type earphone far from 1 m, as a result, even harmonic <b>component</b> <b>was</b> 2 % and odd harmonic <b>component</b> <b>was</b> 35. 5 %. THD of the diaphragm was affected by THD of electric signal...|$|R

5|$|Silver-containing brazing alloys {{are used}} for brazing {{metallic}} materials, mostly cobalt, nickel, and copper-based alloys, tool steels, and precious metals. The basic <b>components</b> <b>are</b> silver and copper, with other elements selected according to the specific application desired: examples include zinc, tin, cadmium, palladium, manganese, and phosphorus. Silver provides increased workability and corrosion resistance during usage.|$|E
5|$|Similar to xenon, neon content {{observed}} in samples of volcanic gases is enriched in 20Ne, {{as well as}} nucleogenic 21Ne, relative to 22Ne content. The neon isotopic content of these mantle-derived samples represents a non-atmospheric source of neon. The 20Ne-enriched <b>components</b> <b>are</b> attributed to exotic primordial rare gas components in the Earth, possibly representing solar neon. Elevated 20Ne abundances are found in diamonds, further suggesting a solar neon reservoir in the Earth.|$|E
5|$|T. cruzi {{can also}} be {{transmitted}} through blood transfusions. With the exception of blood derivatives (such as fractionated antibodies), all blood <b>components</b> <b>are</b> infective. The parasite remains viable at 4°C for at least 18 days or up to 250 days when kept at room temperature. It is unclear whether T. cruzi can be transmitted through frozen-thawed blood components.|$|E
40|$|An {{advanced}} on-board spacecraft data system <b>component</b> <b>is</b> presented. The <b>component</b> <b>is</b> computer-based {{and provides}} science data acquisition, processing, storage, and base-band transmission functions. Specifically, the <b>component</b> <b>is</b> {{a very high}} rate solid state recorder, serving as a pathfinder for achieving the data handling requirements of next-generation hyperspectral imaging missions...|$|R

50|$|This {{provides}} for two inputs and one output. Usually, in an automatic transmission, one <b>component</b> <b>is</b> held fixed, while another <b>component</b> <b>is</b> input, {{and the remaining}} <b>component</b> <b>is</b> used for output. By choosing a set of components for held, input, and output, the planetary gear will increase or decrease speed and change direction.|$|R
5|$|The Minneapolis–St. Paul area is {{the second}} largest {{economic}} center in the Midwest, behind Chicago. The economy of Minneapolis today is based in commerce, finance, rail and trucking services, health care, and industry. Smaller <b>components</b> <b>are</b> in publishing, milling, food processing, graphic arts, insurance, education, and high technology. Industry produces metal and automotive products, chemical and agricultural products, electronics, computers, precision medical instruments and devices, plastics, and machinery. The city at one time produced farm implements.|$|E
5|$|The <b>components</b> <b>are</b> {{placed in}} a {{tantalum}} crucible and fired in a helium atmosphere. As the reaction progresses, the resulting halide compounds and molten dysprosium separate {{due to differences in}} density. When the mixture cools, the dysprosium can be cut away from the impurities.|$|E
5|$|The {{components}} in an electric circuit {{can take many}} forms, which can include elements such as resistors, capacitors, switches, transformers and electronics. Electronic circuits contain active components, usually semiconductors, and typically exhibit non-linear behaviour, requiring complex analysis. The simplest electric <b>components</b> <b>are</b> those that are termed passive and linear: while they may temporarily store energy, they contain no sources of it, and exhibit linear responses to stimuli.|$|E

50|$|The {{intent of}} an {{aftermarket}} <b>component</b> <b>is</b> {{not necessarily to}} modify the appearance, sound, or performance of the vehicle in question. While that is almost always the goal if the aftermarket <b>component</b> <b>is</b> replacing a fully working <b>component,</b> it <b>is</b> frequently the case that when the stock or factory component has worn out that an aftermarket <b>component</b> <b>is</b> either more widely available or less expensive than a factory or OEM replacement.|$|R
30|$|The {{synthetic}} velocities (0.2 – 2  Hz) {{were compared}} with those observed in Case 1 (Fig.  2). The agreement between the observed and synthetic waves is satisfactory at many stations. At KMMH 16, the coincidence of the NS <b>components</b> <b>is</b> almost perfect including the pulses, while the amplitude of the EW <b>component</b> <b>is</b> underestimated, which is {{probably due to the}} fact that the coincidence of the mechanism between the large and the small evens is not perfect. Similarly, the coincidence of the NS <b>component</b> <b>is</b> almost perfect at KMM 011, while the EW <b>component</b> <b>is</b> underestimated. The result for the EW component at KMM 006 is good, while the NS <b>component</b> <b>is</b> underestimated.|$|R
5|$|Titan's <b>components</b> <b>are</b> {{air-cooled}} by heat sinks, {{but the air}} is chilled {{before being}} pumped through the cabinets. Fan noise is so loud that hearing protection is required for people spending more than 15 minutes in the machine room. The system has a cooling capacity of 23.2 MW (6600 tons) and works by chilling water to 5.5 °C (42 °F), which in turn cools recirculated air.|$|E
5|$|Zeta Coronae Borealis is {{a double}} star with two blue-white {{components}} 6.3arcseconds apart that can be readily separated at 100xmagnification. The primary is of magnitude5.1 and the secondary is of magnitude6.0. Nu Coronae Borealis is an optical double, whose <b>components</b> <b>are</b> a similar distance from Earth but have different radial velocities, hence {{are assumed to be}} unrelated. The primary, Nu1 Coronae Borealis, is a red giant of spectral type M2III and magnitude 5.2, lying 640±30 light-years distant, and the secondary, Nu2 Coronae Borealis, is an orange-hued giant star of spectral type K5III and magnitude 5.4, estimated to be 590±30light-years away. Sigma Coronae Borealis, on the other hand, is a true multiple star system divisible by small amateur telescopes. It is actually a complex system composed of two stars around as massive as the Sun that orbit each other every 1.14days, orbited by a third Sun-like star every 726years. The fourth and fifth <b>components</b> <b>are</b> a binary red dwarf system that is 14,000AU distant from the other three stars. ADS 9731 is an even rarer multiple system in the constellation, composed of six stars, two of which are spectroscopic binaries.|$|E
5|$|Any {{mechanical}} component will unavoidably possess both mass and stiffness. This translates in electrical terms to an LC circuit, that is, a circuit consisting of an inductor and a capacitor, hence mechanical <b>components</b> <b>are</b> resonators {{and are often}} used as such. It is still possible to represent inductors and capacitors as individual lumped elements in a mechanical implementation by minimising (but never quite eliminating) the unwanted property. Capacitors may be made of thin, long rods, that is, the mass is minimised and the compliance is maximised. Inductors, on the other hand, may be made of short, wide pieces which maximise the mass {{in comparison to the}} compliance of the piece.|$|E
30|$|Besides, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} ILSR can be {{regarded}} as a special case of IGDR, when the local-mean diffusion component and global-bias diffusion <b>component</b> <b>are</b> set to zeros. Similarly, IPR can be regarded as a special case of IGDR, when the local-mean diffusion <b>component</b> <b>is</b> designed by the local-set and the global-bias diffusion <b>component</b> <b>is</b> set to zero.|$|R
5000|$|Assemble-Measure-Move (AMM) {{processes}} where a <b>component</b> <b>is</b> positioned approximately in an assembly, {{the position}} of the <b>component</b> <b>is</b> measured and then it is moved towards its specified position. This process may be iterated a number of times before the <b>component</b> <b>is</b> within its specified position, alternatively 'real time' measurements may be used to 'track' the component into location.|$|R

5|$|Breathing quality gases do not {{normally}} deteriorate during storage in steel or aluminium cylinders. Provided there is insufficient water content to promote internal corrosion, the stored gas will remain unchanged for years if stored at temperatures within the allowed working range for the cylinder, usually below 65°C. If {{there is any}} doubt, a check of oxygen fraction will indicate whether the gas has changed (the other <b>components</b> <b>are</b> inert). Any unusual smells would be {{an indication that the}} cylinder or gas was contaminated at the time of filling. However some authorities recommend releasing most of the contents and storing cylinders with a small positive pressure.|$|E
5|$|Computers may be {{impacted}} by volcanic ash, with their functionality and usability decreasing during ashfall, {{but it is}} unlikely they will completely fail. The most vulnerable <b>components</b> <b>are</b> the mechanical components, such as cooling fans, cd drives, keyboard, mice and touch pads. These components can become jammed with fine grained ash causing them to cease working; however, most can be restored to working order by cleaning with compressed air. Moist ash may cause electrical short circuits within desktop computers; however, will not affect laptop computers.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's {{electrostatic}} {{machine is}} a high-voltage static electricity generating device used by Benjamin Franklin in the mid-eighteenth century for research into electrical phenomena. Its key <b>components</b> <b>are</b> a glass globe which turned on an axis via a crank; a cloth pad {{in contact with}} the spinning globe; a set of metal needles to conduct away the charge developed on the globe by its friction with the pad; and a Leyden jara high-voltage capacitorto accumulate the charge. Franklin's experiments with the machine eventually led to new theories about electricity and inventing the lightning rod.|$|E
