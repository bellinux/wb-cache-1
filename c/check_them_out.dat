500|$|After {{the more}} {{produced}} Rings Around the World, which {{relied heavily on}} computers and electronics, the group were keen to make Phantom Power [...] "a little more human" [...] with guitarist Huw Bunford stating: [...] "with technology {{you can do anything}} these days, but sometimes less is more". Many songs on the album are acoustic based and bass player Guto Pryce has claimed that they sounded [...] "pretty good right from the start" [...] which also contributed to the decision to avoid [...] "over-tweak them in the studio". Despite this the group did work electronic loops into several tracks after Ciaran bought a large number of [...] "sound effect and light music" [...] vinyl records from a man who worked in the same building. According to Rhys: [...] "he knocked on the door just as we were beginning the album: [...] "hey, I've got these records to sell, are ya interested?" [...] And Cian went down to <b>check</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> and gave him a hundred pounds on the spot and carried 700 albums back to our tiny room".|$|E

Paul Kosky, a Melbourne-based engineer-producer, {{who had worked with}} Crowded House, Rage Against the Machine, Kate Ceberano, and The Clouds, was looking for a new band to manage and record. Kosky had heard [...] "Kettle" [...] on the radio and decided to <b>check</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> at Push Over. In March 2000 Kosky {{recalled}} that their rhythm section were musically weak, although the siblings showed [...] "a raw talent I knew could be turned into a global appeal." [...] The group signed to his management company in 1997 and his new recording label, Wah Wah Music (established with US-based investor, Chris Robinson) in the following year. Kosky helped develop the band for two years and, as their manager, arranged a distribution deal with Roadshow Music (which also had a contract with Savage Garden) for his own label.|$|E
2500|$|In {{that city}} in October 1936, the band had a {{recording}} session which the producer John Hammond later described as [...] "the only perfect, completely perfect recording session I've ever {{had anything to}} do with". Hammond had heard Basie's band by radio and went to Kansas City to <b>check</b> <b>them</b> <b>out.</b> He invited them to record, in performances which were Lester Young's earliest recordings. [...] Those four sides were released on Vocalion Records under the band name of Jones-Smith Incorporated; the sides were [...] "Shoe Shine Boy", [...] "Evening", [...] "Boogie Woogie", and [...] "Lady Be Good". [...] After Vocalion became a subsidiary of Columbia Records in 1938, [...] "Boogie Woogie" [...] was released in 1941 as part of a four-record compilation album entitled Boogie Woogie (Columbia album C44). [...] When he made the Vocalion recordings, Basie had already signed with Decca Records, but did not have his first recording session with them until January 1937.|$|E

2500|$|The {{sections}} build {{with more}} guitar layers, each complementary to the intro, with the drums entering at 4:18. [...] The extended Jimmy Page guitar solo in the song's final section was {{played for the}} recording on a 1959 Fender Telecaster {{given to him by}} Jeff Beck (an instrument he used extensively with the Yardbirds) plugged into a Supro amplifier, although in an interview he gave to Guitar World magazine, Page also claimed, [...] "It could have been a Marshall, but I can't remember". Three different improvised solos were recorded, with Page agonising about deciding which to keep. Page later revealed, [...] "I did have the first phrase worked out, {{and then there was the}} link phrase. I did <b>check</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> beforehand before the tape ran." [...] The other guitar parts were played using a Harmony Sovereign H1260 acoustic guitar and a Fender Electric XII guitar (a 12-string guitar that was plugged directly to the soundboard); these can be heard on the left and right recording channels respectively. For live versions, Page switched to a Heritage Cherry Gibson EDS-1275 6/12 Doubleneck guitar. The final progression is a i-VII-VI (natural minor) progression (Am-G-F), a mainstay of rock music.|$|E

5000|$|Anyway, {{dragging}} {{myself back}} into the modern day a recent arrival at CackBlabbath was the new single from Black Country rockers Liberty Lies. Now when I first <b>checked</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> a while back they were a band who just seemed to be missing something, there was definite potential but they just didn’t quite have that edge…Well, fast forward a few months and the band have a new lineup, a new musical direction and a new single called Confessions Of An Effigy. Oh, and an edge, they definitely found their edge. The “A” side (kids, ask your parents) is the titular Confessions Of An Effigy which hints at just how far Liberty Lies have come. It’s a mature and confident effort which showcases the band’s development into fully fledged home grown rockstars in waiting. It also demonstrates their transformation from their previous blues rock form into something harder and heavier. - Lain.|$|R
