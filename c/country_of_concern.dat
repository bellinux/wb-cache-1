[...] Mexico and Spain both report {{problems}} recovering internationally abducted children from each other's countries.

[...] This mutual noncompliance in honoring the Hague treaty has prompted some to say that both countries are paying each other with the same currency. [...] In 2009 two Spanish fathers made the news in Mexico and Spain for the difficulties they were having in recovering their abducted children from the grandparents of their wives who had recently died of cancer. [...] In both cases the Mexican family filed amparo appeals blocking enforcement of judicial decisions ordering the children returned home to their surviving custodial parent in Spain. [...] One father, after 13 months of litigation and being granted custody of the child in Mexico but denied the ability to leave the country till the decision became final, fled the country and returned to Spain before the legal process finished amidst objections by Mexican authorities that he had acted illegally by removing his son before Mexican courts had finished the lengthy appeal process.|$|E

The presence of certain species in neighbouring regions, together with notes on their distribution and trends, offers valuable information for the interpretation of the status of these species in one’s own study area.

30|$|The {{purpose of}} {{constructing}} or extending a SAM {{will not be}} fulfilled unless we demonstrate its applicability in policy making for that <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern.</b> Therefore, in this section we have described some analyses using the SAM database. First, we have estimated the contribution of various social groups of Indian households on net domestic product (NDP) of India of the year 2007 – 2008. Further we have compared their contribution to NDP with their contribution in total population of India in the year 2007 – 2008. The purpose of this estimate is to understand the average productivity of various social groups of households in India. If {{it is found that}} a particular category of households contributes smaller share in NDP but occupies larger share of population, {{it can be argued that}} this households group is lower productive than other group of households. Secondly, we have estimated types of labour supply by the various social groups of household to understand the causes of lower contribution in NNP. Thirdly, we have estimated the Gini coefficients for rural and urban households separately to understand the level of income inequality within each social group of households. Finally, we have applied SAM multiplier model to analyse the impact of agriculture sectors growth on rural income inequality.|$|E
40|$|Until {{the end of}} the 1990 s, Nicaragua {{was marked}} with social {{conflict}} and internal political struggles. From 2000 until 2006 Nicaragua experienced a relatively democratic period, in which the country drafted Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) with participation of the civil society. In this period, the openness of the political system and the participatory dimension of the PRSPs helped to strengthen civil society and increase policy influencing. As a result a shift took place away from service delivery and towards more lobbying and advocacy. The election of Ortega in 2006 (Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN)) as president introduced the shrinking of this democratic space. From that moment onwards, donors encountered difficulties in dealing with the participation conditionality. At the same time, civil society organizations (CSOs) found it difficult to counterbalance the increasing undemocratic tendencies despite their efforts to organize mobilizations. This paper argues that the NAA, which pushes civil society into the watchdog role, is rather troublesome in contexts which are politically closing down. Imposing the single role of watchdog on civil society is ineffective. The NAA should not be treated as a rigid blueprint but, rather, as a guideline for policy implementation dependent on the actual situation in the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Informal {{and illegal}} {{construction}} {{has been a}} part of Montenegro’s development since the 1990 s. It is estimated that there are around 100 000 informal/illegal constructions in Montenegro, which is approximately 1 / 3 of the total housing stock in the country (Onsrud 2010). Illegal and informal construction is common on the whole territory of the country and often in concentrated living areas, thus creating a whole informal settlement. A typical feature of such construction is either absence of a licence for construction, or construction differing from the conditions of the licence. Most commonly the illegal/informal construction occurs on the investor’s private land, but such construction also occurs on the municipal land. The informal/illegal construction has a negative effect on the country’s development. There are various reasons for the increase of illegal construction in the country. One of such reasons is insufficient land administration during the past two decades. The procedures for obtaining a building permit and registration of property are awfully long, time consuming and costly. The system is so complicated that even the local authorities have difficulties understanding all of the procedures. The local authorities are imposed to double-check and even triple-check all the necessary documentation submitted by the investors for obtaining a building permit, which makes the system very little productive and costly. Amongst other reasons for illegal/informal construction are migration, rapid urbanization, establishment of a free market economy in the country and corruption. The lack of sufficient legislation on illegal/informal structures also contributed to the investors’ fearless attitude towards the illegal/informal construction. The main goal of this study is to describe the existing situation and to contribute to the theoretical understanding of the possible reasons for which illegal/informal construction occurs. This thesis includes the discussion of different aspects that are connected to the problem of informal settlements such as property rights, land administration, public regulations, development and negative impact on the environment. This thesis is based on the knowledge gained through the study of available literature about the theme and a fieldwork in the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern...</b>|$|E
