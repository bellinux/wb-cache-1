5|$|During {{the end of}} {{his final}} season at Vicenza, Baggio {{shattered}} both the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the meniscus of his right knee while playing against Rimini on 5 May 1985, while attempting a slide tackle. The injury occurred two days before his official transfer deal to Fiorentina had been finalised, and it seriously threatened his career, at age 18. Although several team doctors feared he would not play again, Fiorentina retained their faith in him, agreeing to <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> transfer as well as fund the required surgery, one of many reasons for Baggio's attachment to the club.|$|E

5|$|Parker {{originally}} wanted Robert De Niro to {{play the}} role of Harry Angel, but the actor expressed interest in playing Louis Cyphre. De Niro did not fully <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> role until after many discussions with Parker. Jack Nicholson was also considered for the role of Angel. Parker met with Nicholson in Los Angeles to discuss the project, but the actor declined. Parker also met with Mickey Rourke, who expressed a strong interest in playing Angel and secured the leading role after a meeting with Parker in New York.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the reason}} for Somerset's poor {{performances}} was their inability to consistently field their best players; at least four of their better cricketers were unable to <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> full fixture list, and in all the county played 30 different people in their eight matches. Faint praise was offered to the batting of William Herbert Fowler, Newton and Edward Sainsbury in The Sportsman, but the bowling was considered by Wisden to be sub-standard, particularly that of Arnold Fothergill.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the morning, the Germans mopped up British {{survivors}} and stragglers in hiding around Arnhem bridge. It took several hours {{to clear the}} bridge of debris allowing German armour to cross and reinforce Nijmegen. Crucially, the British had held the bridge long enough to allow Nijmegen bridge to be captured by the 82nd Airborne and Guards' Armoured Division working together. With the resistance at the bridge crushed, the Germans had more troops available to <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Oosterbeek engagement, although this changed suddenly in the afternoon.|$|E

Lacking the necessary funding, they approached RCTI in search of sponsorship but were refused, and laughingly told that they should try holding a concert at the National Monument. Undeterred, Chrisye, Subaktyo, and Gutawa put together a group of artists and began rehearsals. Around the time of RCTI's fourth anniversary, the television station relented and agreed to fund the concert as part of their celebrations; the thousands of tickets available sold out within a week.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{continued}} to tour with the Pixies through 2005 and 2006. Though the Catholics were effectively defunct, they released two separate albums of B-sides and rarities, Snake Oil and One More Road for the Hit, on iTunes, {{with an eye}} towards a future CD release. Thompson was also working on more new solo material with Feldman {{in the first part}} of 2006, some of which they performed live. In the fall of 2006, Thompson began his first solo tour since 2003, taking Feldman, Billy Block, and Duane Jarvis along as his backing band. In October 2006, Thompson announced plans for the Pixies to start rehearsing and recording a new album in January 2007, but it is believed that no recording took place because of the reluctance of another member of the Pixies to <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> project. In December 2006, he released the compilation Christmass album; a collection of new studio tracks, hotel room sessions, and live acoustic recordings from a solo tour the previous summer.|$|E
5|$|From early April 1965, Ubon {{became an}} {{important}} base for United States Air Force (USAF) attacks on North Vietnam during the Vietnam War, and No.79 Squadron became part of an integrated air defence system controlled by the USAF on 25June. This changed {{the status of the}} squadron's presence in Thailand, and RAAF Headquarters assessed that the North Vietnamese would be justified in regarding it as forming part of the air campaign against their country. Due to the threat of counter-attacks on Ubon, the base's ground defences were upgraded during 1966; this included the construction of defensive positions for No.79 Squadron's aircraft and personnel as well as the deployment of a detachment of RAAF airfield defence guards. While the squadron did not play {{an active role in the}} war, it supported the US effort by providing air defence for Ubon and taking part in exercises with USAF aircraft in which the Sabres adopted tactics used by North Vietnamese MiG-17 fighters. In December 1965 the commander of the United States Pacific Air Forces, General Hunter Harris, Jr., wrote to the chief of the RAAF, Air Marshal Alister Murdoch, to suggest that No.79 Squadron join the USAF operations against the Ho Chi Minh trail in southern Laos which were being covertly conducted by Ubon-based aircraft. The Thai Government indicated that it would allow the squadron to be used for this purpose as long as the Australian operations were conducted without a formal agreement or any public announcement. On 2March 1966 the Australian Cabinet decided to reinforce the Army and RAAF force in South Vietnam, but rejected the option of expanding the scope of RAAF operations in Thailand. This decision was made on the grounds that the expanded force in South Vietnam and existing deployments to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore represented the maximum forces Australia could <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> region.|$|E
