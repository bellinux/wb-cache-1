This involves cutting slots in the pavement at each joint, placing dowel bars in the slots, then filling them with concrete patching material.

25|$|One of {{the major}} {{advantages}} of <b>concrete</b> <b>pavements</b> is they are typically stronger and more durable than asphalt roadways. They also can be grooved to provide a durable skid-resistant surface. A notable disadvantage is that they typically can have a higher initial cost, and can be more time-consuming to construct. This cost can typically be offset through the long life cycle of the pavement. Concrete pavement can be maintained over time utilizing a series of methods known as concrete pavement restoration which include diamond grinding, dowel bar retrofits, joint and crack sealing, cross-stitching, etc. Diamond grinding is also useful in reducing noise and restoring skid resistance in older concrete pavement.|$|E

Aiming at the {{problems}} of the <b>concrete</b> <b>pavement</b> transverse joint, and the characteristics of prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>pavement</b> and continuously reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>pavement,</b> a transversely prestressed continuous <b>concrete</b> <b>pavement</b> with oblique-reinforced is presented. ABAQUS software is adopted to establish respectively two three-dimensional finite element models of plain <b>concrete</b> <b>pavement</b> and transversely prestressed continuous <b>concrete</b> <b>pavement</b> with oblique-reinforced for calculating mechanical behavior under the standard load. The results show that, with a <b>concrete</b> <b>pavement</b> slab transversely prestressed, a finite prestressing force exist in longitudinal by bonding among oblique-reinforced and concrete, and there isnâ€™t tensile stress under the load, so the possibility of slab breakage due to tensile stress is low. Due to its excellent performance, in addition its great load-carrying capacity and overall stability, the investigation is valuable for the research of seamlessly prestressed pavement...|$|R

40|$|Until {{the early}} 1990 s, curling and warping of Portland cement <b>concrete</b> <b>{{pavement}}</b> did not concern pavement engineers in many transportation agencies. Since beginning {{construction of the}} interstate system in the United States in the late 1950 s through the late 1980 s, the performance of Portland cement <b>concrete</b> <b>pavement</b> {{has been associated with}} properties of <b>concrete</b> as a <b>pavement</b> material. In those years developed standards and design guidelines emphasized better concrete materials and construction control. At the time, combining curling and loading stresses was quite controversial {{due to the nature of}} the load-carrying capacity of <b>concrete</b> <b>pavement</b> and the occurrence of types of loads. Arguments developed that the types of loads (traffic and curling) rarely occurred at the same time of day. The <b>concrete</b> <b>pavement</b> design principle did not include the effects of curling and warping of <b>concrete</b> <b>pavement</b> as determining design factors in pavement performance. This research project was initiated as a response from the INDOT Pavement Steering Committee related to the joint spacing of Jointed Plain <b>Concrete</b> <b>Pavement</b> in Indiana. There was an initiative in the Committee to reduce the joint spacing from 18 feet to 15 feet as a way to reduce premature <b>concrete</b> <b>pavement</b> deterioration. There was an indication that some newly paved JPCP had transverse cracks even before the pavement section was opened to traffic. In this experimental study, several important conclusions were drawn from temperature analysis, stress-strain analysis, and other data analysis.

To minimize the effects of traffic congestions, the study is intended to assess the feasibility of using Precsat <b>Concrete</b> <b>Pavement</b> (PCP) method in INDOT pavement construction. The research investigated the state-of-the-art of the PCP methods lately developed in United States. The conventional <b>concrete</b> <b>pavement</b> methods such as Portland Cement <b>Concrete</b> <b>Pavement</b> (PCCP) including Jointed Plain <b>Concrete</b> <b>Pavement</b> (JPCP), Jointed Reinforced <b>Concrete</b> <b>Pavement</b> (JRCP), and Continuously Reinforced <b>Concrete</b> <b>Pavement</b> (CRCP) were reviewed and compared with PCP methods. With the speedy construction and lower user impact cost of PCP, the PCP methods were further studied. It was found that Precast Prestressed <b>Concrete</b> <b>Pavement</b> (PPCP) is used in Texas and California; Super-slab method in New York.

Tire-pavement noise highly depends on the characteristics of pavement texture. Therefore, estimation of texture characteristics may give useful information to predict tire-pavement noise. This study aimed to find the relationship between tire-pavement noise and MPD(Mean Profile Depth) for <b>concrete</b> <b>pavement.</b> METHODS: MPD and tire-pavement noise were collected on the number of expressway sections including Central Inland Test Road in Korea.

50|$|Three main {{types of}} <b>concrete</b> <b>pavements</b> {{commonly}} used are Jointed plain concrete pavement (JPCP), jointed reinforced concrete pavement (JRCP), and continuously reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>pavements</b> (CRCP). JPCPâ€™s are constructed with contraction joints which direct the natural cracking of the pavement. These pavements {{do not use}} any reinforcing steel. JRCPâ€™s are constructed with both contraction joints and reinforcing steel to control the cracking of the pavement. High temperatures and moisture stresses within the pavement creates cracking, which the reinforcing steel holds tightly together. At transverse joints, dowel bars are typically placed to assist with transferring the load of the vehicle across the cracking. CRCPâ€™s solely rely on continuous reinforcing steel to hold the pavementâ€™s natural transverse cracks together. Prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>pavements</b> have also {{been used in the}} construction of highways; however, they are not as common as the other three. Prestressed pavements allow for a thinner slab thickness by partly or wholly neutralizing thermally induced stresses or loadings.|$|E

Temperature and humidity are important impact factors of <b>concrete</b> <b>pavement</b> cracking. Base on the analysis of temperature and humidity inside and outside the tunnel, this paper studies the influence of temperature and humidity on the continuously reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>pavement</b> cracking conditions of the test-road, and the application of continuously reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>pavement</b> in the tunnel and outside by investigating the crack development. It is found that the daily temperature difference is 2 Â°C in the tunnel, the annual temperature difference and humidity are 8. 9 Â°C and 75 âˆ¼ 85 %, respectively. Temperature during the construction and curing temperature and humidity of continuously reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>pavement</b> is of great influence on the crack occurrence. Cracks outside the tunnel occur more and are with concentrated distribution in the early stage. Crack distribution in the tunnel is more reasonable. After eight months including a winter, the crack number increased significantly outside, while the spacing was wider and the width was smaller in the tunnel. Results show that appropriate temperature and humidity can guarantee a cement road application, continuously reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>pavement</b> crack form is more reasonable, performance in the crack width is small, the spacing is big, which reduces the possibility of punchout and spalling...|$|R
