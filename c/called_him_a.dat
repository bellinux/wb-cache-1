5|$|Friar Simon {{had lain}} sick for some time. He died at Guðey. His corpse was {{afterwards}} carried up to Kintire where the Greyfriars interred {{him in their}} Church. They spread a fringed pall over his grave, and <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> Saint.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary sources also {{differed}} on his status. Foreign visitors often <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> chief, {{especially during}} his capacity as royal governor, {{but most of}} his contemporaries like Samuel Kamakau, missionary Hiram Bingham I, and even King Kamehameha III considered him a makaʻāinana or commoner. Kapeau {{was one of the}} first non-royal Hawaiians to receive a western education from the missionaries who arrived in Hawaii in 1820.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's {{success in}} the United States came a little later, when Michigan State University Press started {{publishing}} his books. His {{first visit to the}} country was on a fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation, and he lectured at various universities including Michigan State University and the University of California, Berkeley. Around this time, John Updike noticed his work and compared Narayan to Charles Dickens. In a review of Narayan's works published in The New Yorker, Updike <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> writer of a vanishing breed—the writer as a citizen; one who identifies completely with his subjects and with a belief in the significance of humanity.|$|E
50|$|The {{contemporary}} writers <b>call</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> Serb, but do {{not mention}} his genealogy, while the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, a later, more dubious source, <b>calls</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> cousin to previous ruler Jovan Vladimir (r. 990-1016).|$|R
5000|$|Sadanand {{never went}} to college and was a self-taught {{journalist}}. J. K. Singh <b>calls</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> great journalist but a poor business manager and a [...] "sad failure". Rangaswami Parthasarathy <b>calls</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> able editor, an innovator and a fearless patriot.|$|R
50|$|Critics <b>call</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> mystic and existential writer.|$|R
5|$|Gandhi {{focused his}} {{attention}} on Indians while in South Africa. He {{was not interested in}} politics. This changed after he was discriminated against and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach because of his skin colour by a white train official. After several such incidents with Whites in South Africa, Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, he felt he must resist this and fight for rights. He entered politics by forming Natal Indian Congress. According to Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, Gandhi's views on racism are contentious, in some cases distressing to those who admire him. Gandhi suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied him his rights, the press and those in the streets bullied and <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> parasite, semi-barbarous, canker, squalid coolie, yellow man, and other epithets. People would spit on him as an expression of racial hate.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, Tillman accused {{his junior}} {{colleague}} from South Carolina, John L. McLaurin, {{of corruption in}} a speech to the Senate. McLaurin, who had been a Tillmanite before breaking from him after being elected to the Senate, <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> liar, whereupon Tillman rushed across the Senate floor and punched McLaurin in the face. McLaurin reciprocated, giving Tillman a bloody nose before the Sergeant at Arms and senators intervened. The body immediately went into closed session, and held both men in contempt. The Senate considered suspending them, but Tillman argued that it was unfair to deprive South Carolina of her representation, though the body could certainly expel the two men—knowing he had enough Democratic votes to prevent it. In the end, both men were censured, and later that year, Tillman arranged for McLaurin, whose term ended in 1903, to not be re-elected.|$|E
5|$|When Bart is sent by {{his captors}} into town {{to buy a}} case of antifreeze, he sees a gendarme and tries to ask for help, but the gendarme does not {{understand}} English and only gives Bart a piece of candy. Bart walks away, despairing over his own stupidity, then suddenly begins speaking French to himself. Realizing he has become fluent in the language, he runs back to the gendarme and tells him about the winemakers, who are swiftly arrested and Bart finishes his stay in France being hailed as a hero. He is awarded a medal for his bravery and he is kissed by a French beauty queen. Back in Springfield, Adil is caught by the FBI, forcing him to be deported back to Albania {{in exchange for their}} own child spy. Bart returns to his family, bringing them gifts from France. Back at home trying out the gifts, Homer has difficulty opening a wine bottle, but is pleased to hear Bart speak French, oblivious that Bart has just <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> buffoon.|$|E

25|$|The {{reactions}} on Riis's admission {{have been}} mixed. Some critics have <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> cheater, {{and that the}} results he achieved in his career were worthless. Others have labelled him {{as a victim of}} the doping culture that was rampant in professional road cycling, and have insisted that he should not be scapegoated for a wider problem.|$|E
25|$|Even {{during his}} lifetime, people were {{unsure of the}} degree to which Washington {{believed}} in Christianity. As noted above, some of his contemporaries <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> deist. Debate continues to this day regarding whether he is best categorized as a deist or as a Christian, and some writers have introduced other terms to describe a blending of the two.|$|E
25|$|Sharpton, Maddox, and Mason {{generated}} a national media sensation. The three claimed that officials {{all the way}} up to the state government were trying to cover up defendants in the case because they were white.

However, during a Test on England's 1989–90 {{tour of the}} West Indies he criticised the umpire Lloyd Barker, claiming that he had {{allowed himself to be}} pressurised by the West Indies captain, Viv Richards, into wrongly giving Rob Bailey out caught down the leg side. Barker threatened to sue, believing incorrectly that Martin-Jenkins had <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> cheat. The case was settled by the BBC without going to court.|$|E
25|$|Harrison Ford, {{who played}} Deckard in the film, {{has said that}} he did not think Deckard was a replicant, and {{has said that he}} and {{director}} Ridley Scott had discussions that ended in the agreement that the character was human. According to several interviews with Scott, Deckard is a replicant. Deckard collects photographs which are seen on his piano, yet has no obvious family beyond a reference to his ex-wife (who <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> “cold fish"). In a scene in which Deckard talks with Rachael, their pupils both appear to shine—a characteristic of replicants.|$|E
25|$|But {{cooperation}} {{within the}} Committee of Public Prosperity, since April 1793 {{the de facto}} executive government, started to break down. On 29 June 1794, three colleagues of Robespierre at 'the Committee' <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> dictator in his face – Robespierre baffled left the meeting. This encouraged other Convention members to also defy Robespierre. On 26 July, a long and vague speech of Robespierre wasn't met with thunderous applause as usual but with hostility; some deputies yelled that Robespierre should {{have the courage to}} say which deputies he deemed necessary to be killed next, what Robespierre refused to do.|$|E
