25|$|The {{prototype}} car, SP 618000 {{was turned}} out in December, 1968 and tested through 1969. Chevrolet conducted vibration and low-speed crash tests to make sure nose-down Vegas wouldn't shift or be damaged in railcar collisions. Chevrolet's goal was to deliver Vegas topped with fluids and ready {{to drive to the}} dealership. To do this Vega engineers had to design a special engine oil baffle to prevent oil from entering the No. 1 cylinder, batteries had filler caps located high up on the rear edge of the case to prevent acid spilling, the <b>carburetor</b> <b>float</b> bowl had a special tube that drained gasoline into the vapor canister during shipment, and the windshield washer bottle stood at a 45 degree angle. Plastic spacers were wedged in beside the powertrain to prevent damage to engine and transmission mounts. The wedges were removed when cars were unloaded. The rail car doors were opened and closed by means of a forklift truck.|$|E
50|$|Cork is an {{excellent}} gasket material. Some <b>carburetor</b> <b>float</b> bowl gaskets are made of cork, for example.|$|E
50|$|Engine {{flooding}} was {{a common}} problem with carbureted cars, but newer fuel-injected ones are immune to the problem when operating within normal tolerances. Flooding usually occurs during starting, especially under cold conditions or because the accelerator has been pumped. It can also occur during hot starting; high temperatures may cause fuel in the <b>carburetor</b> <b>float</b> chamber to evaporate into the inlet manifold, causing the air/fuel mixture to exceed the upper explosive limit. High temperature fuel may also result in a vapor lock, which is unrelated to flooding but has a similar symptom.|$|E
50|$|Fuel {{injection}} {{systems are}} {{also able to}} operate normally regardless of orientation, whereas <b>carburetors</b> with <b>floats</b> {{are not able to}} operate upside down or in microgravity, such as encountered on airplanes.|$|R
5000|$|Daimler {{invented the}} <b>float</b> <b>carburetor</b> {{which was used}} until {{replaced}} by fuel injection ...|$|R
5000|$|Chevrolet {{introduced}} a mechanical fuel injection option, made by General Motors' Rochester Products Division, for its 283 V8 engine in 1956 (1957 U.S. model year). This system directed the inducted engine air across a [...] "spoon shaped" [...] plunger that moved {{in proportion to}} the air volume. The plunger connected to the fuel metering system that mechanically dispensed fuel to the cylinders via distribution tubes. This system was not a [...] "pulse" [...] or intermittent injection, but rather a constant flow system, metering fuel to all cylinders simultaneously from a central [...] "spider" [...] of injection lines. The fuel meter adjusted the amount of flow according to engine speed and load, and included a fuel reservoir, which was similar to a <b>carburetor's</b> <b>float</b> chamber. With its own high-pressure fuel pump driven by a cable from the distributor to the fuel meter, the system supplied the necessary pressure for injection. This was a [...] "port" [...] injection where the injectors are located in the intake manifold, very near the intake valve.|$|R
5000|$|A severe form {{of engine}} {{flooding}} occurs when excessive liquid fuel enters the combustion chamber. This reduces the dead {{volume of the}} combustion chamber and thus places a heavy load on the starter motor, such that it fails to turn the engine. Damage (due to excessive compression and even dilution of the lubricating oil with fuel) can also occur. This condition {{is known as the}} engine [...] "flooding out." [...] Possible causes of too much liquid fuel in the engine include a defective <b>carburetor</b> <b>float</b> that is not closing the fuel inlet needle valve, or debris caught in the needle valve preventing it from sealing.|$|E
50|$|KB Khimavtomatika's {{original}} mandate was {{to develop}} aviation fuel systems for Soviet military during World War II. Kosberg had spent ten years working at the Central Institute of Aircraft Engine Construction on fuel systems and was tapped to run the new bureau. Approaching German armies required the group to relocate to Berdsk, Siberia, where Kosberg {{and his team of}} about 30 specialists developed direct injection fuel systems, eventually implemented on the La-5, La-7, Tupolev Tu-2 and Tu-2D. The new fuel systems provided a significant increase in performance over conventional gasoline fuel systems and eliminated <b>carburetor</b> <b>float</b> problems caused by aggressive combat flying. They competed with direct injection systems developed by Daimler Benz at the time. After the end of the war, the design bureau was moved to Voronezh, where it continued to design fuel systems for piston, turboprop and jet aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|The 71 {{series is}} very popular in marine applications, {{not only as a}} {{propulsion}} engine in small craft (Gray Marine 6-71) but as auxiliary power to drive generators, winches and other heavy shipboard machinery. The Motor Lifeboat CG36500 featured in [...] "The Finest Hours" [...] movie had a used Detroit 4-71 added AFTER the SS Pendleton rescue, and is still in service. Serial number is #1420. Her original engine was a Sterling Petrel 6 cylinder gas engine, which suffered fuel starvation when the boat rolled violently due to the <b>carburetor</b> <b>float</b> getting hung up.The inline 6-71 engine, in all of its variations, was also available as a 'pancake engine' (here variably called either 6L-71 or 6N-71) for horizontal (underfloor) mount applications, such as on larger Crown and Gillig school buses and articulated puller transit buses (such as the Crown-Ikarus 286).|$|E
50|$|The initial {{engine was}} the Ford 170 CID L straight-6, {{modified}} with solid valve lifters, a 6 USqt L oil pan, heavy-duty fuel pump, oil-bath air cleaner, and a <b>carburetor</b> with a <b>float</b> bowl compensated against tilting.|$|R
5000|$|Dorris is {{credited}} with developing and patenting the <b>float</b> <b>carburetor,</b> an innovation that was used for decades. For much of the Dorris production life the slogan was [...] "Built up to a standard, not down to a price." ...|$|R
5000|$|The fuel {{stored in}} the chamber (bowl) {{can be a problem}} in hot climates. If the engine is shut off while hot, the {{temperature}} of the fuel will increase, sometimes boiling ("percolation"). This can result in flooding and difficult or impossible restarts while the engine is still warm, a phenomenon known as [...] "heat soak". Heat deflectors and insulating gaskets attempt to minimize this effect. The Carter Thermo-Quad <b>carburetor</b> has <b>float</b> chambers manufactured of insulating plastic (phenolic), said to keep the fuel 20 degrees Fahrenheit (11 degrees Celsius) cooler.|$|R

50|$|In 1885, Wilhelm Maybach and Gottlieb Daimler {{developed}} a <b>float</b> <b>carburetor</b> for their engine {{based on the}} atomizer nozzle. The Daimler-Maybach carburetor was copied extensively, leading to patent lawsuits, but British courts rejected the Daimler company's claim of priority in favor of Edward Butler's 1884 spray carburetor used on his Petrol Cycle.|$|R
50|$|The Rotax 277 {{features}} a single piston ported, air-cooled cylinder head and cylinder, utilizing either a fan or free air for cooling. Lubrication is pre-mixed fuel and oil. The 277 {{has a single}} Bosch flywheel magneto generator 12 volt ignition system and {{is equipped with a}} 36 mm Bing double <b>float</b> <b>carburetor,</b> with either a hand lever or cable choke.|$|R

5000|$|Most {{aircraft}} of the 1920s and 1930s had a float-type carburetor. They {{are adequate}} for civil aircraft which normally fly upright, but present {{a problem for}} aerobatic aircraft which fly upside-down or otherwise are subject to negative G, especially military fighters. In a <b>float</b> <b>carburetor,</b> the <b>float</b> operates a valve which keeps the fuel level in the carburetor consistent despite varying demands. If the mixture is too rich, the float rises and restricts the fuel flowing in to the float chamber. When the mixture leans, the float falls and allows more fuel in. However, since the float is dependent on gravity to function, the float behaves opposite of its intended design when the aircraft is inverted. It will further enrich a too-rich mixture, or further lean a too-lean mixture. Either condition will cause the engine to stop running. If an airplane equipped with a float-type carburetor is flown under zero-G or negative-G conditions, the fuel metering cannot be relied upon to create a mixture that can be ignited, and the engine will stop running. The problem was keenly felt by the RAF during {{the first years of}} the war, as the Rolls-Royce Merlin equipped Hurricanes and the Spitfires suffered this effect, unlike the direct fuel injection engines of their German counterparts. The problem was solved by installing a flow-restricted orifice that opened only when flying inverted or under negative-G conditions (the R.A.E. restrictor was known as [...] "Miss Shilling's orifice"), but this was only a stopgap solution.|$|R
5000|$|Johnson and Busk were {{themselves}} {{responsible for the}} construction of the first commercial chainsaw, [...] "Jobu Senior," [...] which had an [...] "Aspin" [...] engine with a standard <b>carburetor</b> with <b>float</b> chamber. Whenever the saw was placed on the side, the carburetor had to be rotated accordingly. Jobu Senior weighed 17.5 kg and was only applicable for felling and bucking.The next model was Junior, which was released on the market in 1952. The engine in Junior was manufactured by Jobu themselves. Junior came with its predecessor carburetor solution that still had to be rotated. The weight was reduced to 10.4 kg. This saw became very popular, and around 40 000 units were produced. Jobu Tiger, which came in 1960, was a major advance. This model had a diaphragm carburetor that worked in all positions.|$|R
50|$|The Rotax 447 {{features}} piston-ported, air-cooled {{cylinder heads}} and cylinders, utilizing either a fan or free air for cooling. Lubrication is {{by use of}} pre-mixed fuel and oil. The engine can be equipped with either one or two piston-type <b>float</b> <b>carburetors.</b> The dual-carburetor version uses Bing model 84 carburetors. The single-carburetor version uses a Bing model 54 carburetor. An optional High Altitude Compensation kit is available. It is typically installed with an induction-pulse-driven diaphragm fuel pump to provide fuel pressure.|$|R
50|$|The new {{front-wheel-drive}} {{was a vast}} {{improvement over}} the old Megola design. The weight of the engine was lower. The front wheel with integrated engine had a combined weight of 50 kg (110 lb). Additionally, a custom <b>carburetor</b> without a <b>float</b> needle didn’t have the problems caused by vibration. And finally, the light-weight battery ignition allowed trouble-free engine starts and helped to keep the engine weight low. The distributor and the points were located in the hub. The technicians originally intended to build a dynastarter. These improvements {{would have been impossible}} to add to the old Megola design.|$|R
2500|$|With {{the success}} of the 1952 season, {{independent}} or [...] "privateer" [...] riders could now purchase a [...] "catalog" [...] version of the 125 DOHC, now available through the company. [...] The Sport Competizione racer had many of the same features as the factory bike. These included a multi-plate clutch, gear-driven oil pump, Dell'Orto 27mm SS1 <b>carburetor</b> and remote <b>float</b> chamber. The bike was nicknamed the [...] "Boy Racer". In 1953, the race engineers adopted the Earles-type forks to help with handling problems on the works racers. The 1953 season saw the introduction of the 350 Four. [...] MV’s racing efforts now included the 500cc, 350cc and 125cc class.|$|R
50|$|Like a <b>float</b> <b>carburetor,</b> a {{pressure}} carburetor has a barrel with a venturi inside it through which air flows {{on its way}} to the engine cylinders. However, it does not have a float to control the flow of fuel into the carburetor. Instead, it has four chambers in a row separated by flexible diaphragms. The diaphragms are attached concentrically to a shaft which operates a wedge-shaped servo valve. This valve controls the rate at which fuel can enter the pressure carburetor. Inside the barrel, downstream of the throttle sits the discharge valve, which is a spring-loaded valve operated by fuel pressure that controls the rate that fuel is discharged into the barrel.|$|R
