500|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey {{is a member}} of the family Cebidae, the family of New World monkeys containing {{squirrel monkey}}s, capuchin monkeys, tamarins and marmosets. Within the family Cebidae, it {{is a member of}} the subfamily Saimiriinae, the subfamily containing squirrel monkeys. It is one of five recognized species of squirrel monkey, and the only species occurring outside South America. The Central American Squirrel Monkey is placed in genus Saimiri (Voigt, 1831) along with all the other squirrel monkey species. Among the squirrel monkeys, the Central American squirrel monkey is most closely related to the <b>common</b> <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> (Saimiri sciureus) and the bare-eared squirrel monkey (Saimiri ustus) and these three species form the S. sciureus species group.

40|$|Primates {{are known}} for being highly social species, living in groups of various {{compositions}} with different social structures. The study of social or observational learning has largely focussed on investigating non-human primates’ abilities to imitate, with a more recent shift towards examining {{the social context of}} social learning. This shift has presented opportunities to investigate how the social context of different species affects the diffusion of socially learnt behaviours. In this thesis, I set out to monitor the spread of different experimentally seeded and naturally occurring socially learned behaviours in brown (tufted) capuchin monkeys (Sapajus sp.) and <b>common</b> <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkeys</b> (Saimiri sciureus). These species were selected as they form mixed species groups in the wild, and display marked differences in their social tolerances, thus presenting the opportunity to investigate conspecific and heterospecific social learning in related but differently bonded social groups. My results show evidence of social learning from conspecifics in capuchin and <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkeys,</b> attesting to that already documented in capuchin monkeys and indicating for the first time, that <b>common</b> <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkeys</b> can learn socially. Additionally, I demonstrate that capuchin monkeys are influenced by <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkeys</b> when foraging for food in mixed species groups. Furthermore, although <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkeys</b> are not as socially tolerant as capuchin monkeys, individuals who were better connected within the foraging test area learned experimentally-seeded techniques of models faster and more faithfully. When performing socially contagious anointing behaviours, regardless of tufted capuchin monkeys being influenced by the amount of resources provided for them to anoint with, they still performed more socially anointing than has been previously documented in other captive species, corroborating the levels of social anointing demonstrated in semi-free ranging groups. Further support was found for anointing demonstrating a social bonding and medicinal function in tufted capuchin monkeys...|$|R

40|$|Francisella tularensis, a small Gram-negative facultative {{intracellular}} bacterium, is the causative {{agent of}} tularaemia, a severe zoonotic disease transmitted to humans mostly by vectors such as ticks, flies and mosquitoes. The disease is endemic {{in many parts}} of the northern hemisphere. Among animals, the most affected species belong to rodents and lagomorphs, in particular hares. However, in the recent years, many cases of tularaemia among small monkeys in zoos were reported. We have developed a real-time PCR that allows to quantify F. tularensis in tissue samples. Using this method, we identified the spleen and the kidney as the most heavily infected organ containing up to 400 F. tularensis bacteria per simian host cell in two <b>common</b> <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkeys</b> (Saimiri sciureus) from a zoo that died of tularaemia. In other organs such as the brain, F. tularensis was detected at much lower titres. The strain that caused the infection was identified as F. tularensis subsp. holarctica biovar I, which is susceptible to erythromycin. The high number of F. tularensis present in soft organs such as spleen, liver and kidney represents a high risk for persons handling such carcasses and explains the transmission of the disease to a pathologist during post-mortem analysis. Herein, we show that real-time PCR allows a reliable and rapid diagnosis of F. tularensis directly from tissue samples of infected animals, which is crucial in order to attempt accurate prophylactic measures, especially in cases where humans or other animals have been exposed to this highly contagious pathogen...|$|R
40|$|ArticleCopyright © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015 Comparative {{studies of}} primate {{personality}} offer informative {{insights into the}} evolutionary origins of personality structure in primate species. Primate personality research has however focused on {{a limited number of}} species. We investigated personality in three relatively understudied species: Sulawesi black crested macaques (Macaca nigra), Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus) and <b>common</b> <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkeys</b> (Saimiri sciureus). A 38 item questionnaire was sent to all European zoological institutions holding the study species and keepers were required to rate animals on all items. Assessments achieved good levels of inter-rater reliability. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) revealed Sociability and Dominance personality dimensions in all study species, an Emotionality dimension in both M. nigra, and M. sylvanus, a Cautiousness dimension in S. sciureus and a Human-Animal Sociability dimension in M. sylvanus. Sociability and Dominance dimensions were shown to have good construct validity, as assessed through appropriate relationships with sex and age and correlations with behavioural measures. The Sociability, Dominance, Emotionality and Cautiousness dimensions were comparable with analogous dimensions in other primate species but aggressive-type traits did not load onto the Dominance dimension in M. nigra and M. sylvanus. We suggest that this may be attributed to their more tolerant social systems compared to other primate species. The Human-Animal Sociability dimension could not be compared with other primate studies as, to date, there has been limited investigation of human-directed personality dimensions in captive primates. Our findings suggest that the two Macaca species are more similar to each other, in terms of their personality structure, than either is to S. sciureus which indicates phylogenetic similarity is an important predictor of personality. However further comparative analysis of a wider range of primate species is needed to inform theories regarding the evolution of primate personality structure.
