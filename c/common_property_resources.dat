50|$|The Guassa Area {{originated}} as a community-based {{natural resource}} management system known as “Qero” over 400 years ago. It {{is one of}} the oldest known conservation areas in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Qero system is organized by two formally elected chiefs who oversee the beneficiary communities to ensure equitable resource distribution, and enforce the bylaws protecting the <b>common</b> <b>property</b> <b>resources.</b> Based on traditional tenure patterns, rules of protection and utilization as well as enforcement are essential aspects of the Qero system. Further organization of the user community into parishes gave the Guassa area the status of consecrated land, under the protective patronage of the parish, which reinforced the Qero system with the prestige, power, and authority of another important local level institution. In the process, the Guassa <b>common</b> <b>property</b> <b>resources</b> became a kind of sacred entity. Following the 1974 popular revolution, the government nationalized all rural land in the country, disbanded all local level land tenure and common property natural resource management institutions. This agrarian reform destroyed the functionality of the Qero system and the Guassa area was turned into an open access resource, which resulted in extreme decline of natural resources in the area.|$|E
50|$|The {{basic problem}} is that if people ignore the {{scarcity}} value of the commons, they can end up expending too much effort, over harvesting a resource (e.g., a fishery). Hardin theorizes that {{in the absence of}} restrictions, users of an open-access resource will use it more than if they had to pay for it and had exclusive rights, leading to environmental degradation. See, however, Ostrom's (1990) work on how people using real <b>common</b> <b>property</b> <b>resources</b> have worked to establish self-governing rules {{to reduce the risk of}} the tragedy of the commons.|$|E

Scott Gordon. The theoretical framework showed that the <b>common</b> <b>property</b> nature of fisheries results in competition between individual operators to increase their share of the catch, which can ultimately lead to excessive capital, such as fishing vessels and gear, overfishing and <b>resource</b> wastage. In <b>common</b> <b>property</b> fisheries, individual operators face an incentive to harvest as many fish as quickly as possible to pre-empt the activities by other operators.|$|R

50|$|Even {{though much}} of {{mainstream}} journalism considers Malthusianism the only view of environmentalism, most sociologists {{would disagree with}} Malthusianism since social organizational issues of environmental degradation are more demonstrated to cause environmental problems than abstract population or selfishness per se. For examples of this critique, Ostrom in her book Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action (1990) argues that instead of self-interest always causing degradation, it can sometimes motivate people {{to take care of}} their <b>common</b> <b>property</b> <b>resources.</b> To do this they must change the basic organizational rules of resource use.

The symmetric Nash equilibrium involves excessive participation (a <b>common</b> <b>property</b> <b>resource</b> problem) if participants’ payoffs are decreasing (in the number of participants), and insufficient participation if payoffs are increasing. With decreasing payoffs there can be many equilibria, but with increasing payoffs there are only three.

Her observations contradict claims that common-pool resources must be privatized or else face destruction in the long run due to collective action problems leading to the overuse of the core resource (see also Tragedy of the commons).|$|E

40|$|Using {{data from}} villages in three districts of Western Rajasthan, this paper {{describes}} the decline in area and deterioration in quality of <b>common</b> <b>property</b> <b>resources</b> over three decades. The decline of <b>common</b> <b>property</b> <b>resources</b> is associated with institutional changes in the villages. The introduction of land reforms in the early 1950 s led to large-scale privatization of <b>common</b> <b>property</b> <b>resources,</b> reduced the private cost of use of <b>common</b> <b>property</b> <b>resources,</b> and slackened their upkeep by disrupting the traditional management system. Increased commercialization of livestock farming, increased use of tractors, and demographic pressure also played roles in the process. Farmers adjusted to shrinking <b>common</b> <b>property</b> <b>resources</b> by reducing herd size, by changing its composition, and by relying more on private resources to rear animals. These changes tend to reduce the comparative advantage of livestock farming in the arid region. Since the shrinkage of <b>common</b> <b>property</b> <b>resources</b> is largely {{a result of the}} transfer of submarginal lands from grazing to cropping, resource degradation is accelerated...|$|E
40|$|In {{the wake}} of 25 years of {{unsuccessful}} single-fisheries management in the Gulf of Maine, there has been growing support for reform. Ecosystem management has been proposed as one alternative, but the information needed to manage whole ecosystems is greatly lacking. Implementing fully-protected marine protected areas (MPAs) {{is one way to}} preserve habitat {{while at the same time}} acquiring data for future ecosystem management. Under the current institutional arrangement in the Gulf, engineering agreement for MPAs is difficult due to the differing goals of varied user groups. The situation is reflective of a <b>common</b> <b>property</b> <b>resource</b> problem in that there are many individual users with no property rights reaping benefits from a shared resource, the Gulf of Maine. The result is overexploitation of the resource, in this case fish and associated biota and habitat. <b>Common</b> <b>property</b> <b>resource</b> dilemmas have been well studied by political scientists such as Elinor Ostrom.
