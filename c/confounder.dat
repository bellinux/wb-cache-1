40|$|Background: Instrumental {{variable}} (IV) analysis {{appears to}} be an attractive method to adjust for confounding in pharmacoepidemiological research. One of the underlying assumptions is that the IV should be independent of <b>confounders.</b> If this assumption is violated, the IV estimate can be severely biased. Objectives: To explore the usefulness of balance measures commonly used in propensity score methods, using a simulated data, to quantitatively verify the assumption that the IV should be independent of <b>confounders.</b> Methods: We simulated cohorts of varying sample sizes, binary IV and exposure, continuous outcome, and several <b>confounders.</b> Different associations among IV, exposure, and <b>confounders</b> were considered and 10, 000 replications were used in each scenario. Data were analyzed using the two-stage least squares method. The balance of <b>confounders</b> across IV levels was assessed using the standardized difference. Values of the standardized difference that are close to zero indicate a balance of <b>confounders</b> across IV groups. We also estimated the correlation between the standardized difference and bias of the IV estimates. Results: Bias of IV estimates increased with weaker IVs (i. e., weak association between IV and exposure) and increasing values of the standardized difference (i. e. decreasing balance of <b>confounders</b> across IV categories). IV estimates were more biased than those of classical regression estimates with increasing values of the standardized difference, and a weak IV amplified this bias. Conclusions: Balance measures that are commonly used in propensity score methods can be useful tools to quantitatively verify one of the assumptions underlying IV analysis, i. e., that the IV should be independent of <b>confounders.</b> However, these balance measures only quantify the balance of observed <b>confounders</b> and not of unobserved <b>confounders...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Propensity score (PS) {{methods are}} {{frequently}} used within economic evaluations based on nonrandomized data {{to adjust for}} measured <b>confounders,</b> but many researchers omit {{the fact that they}} cannot adjust for unmeasured <b>confounders.</b> Objective: To illustrate how confounding due to unmeasured <b>confounders</b> can bias an economic evaluation despite PS matching. Methods: We used data from a previously published nonrandomized study to select a prematched population consisting of 121 patients (46. 5 %) who received endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and 139 patients (53. 5 %) who received open surgical repair (OSR), in which sufficient data regarding eight measured <b>confounders</b> were available. One-to-one PS matching was used within this population to select two PS-matched subpopulations. The Matched PS-Smoking Excluded Subpopulation was selected by matching patients using a PS model that omitted patients’ smoking status (one of the measured <b>confounders),</b> whereas the Matched PS-Smoking Included Subpopulation was selected by matching patients using a PS model that included all eight measured <b>confounders.</b> Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were assessed within both subpopulations. Results: Both subpopulations were composed of two different sets of 164 patients. Balance within the Matched PS-Smoking Excluded Subpopulation was achieved on all <b>confounders</b> except for patients’ smoking status, whereas balance within the Matched PS-Smoking Included Subpopulation was achieved on all <b>confounders.</b> Results indicated that the ICER of EVAR over OSR differed between both subpopulations; the ICER was estimated at $ 157, 909 per life-year gained (LYG) within the Matched PS-Smoking Excluded Subpopulation, while it was estimated at $ 235, 074 per LYG within the Matched PS-Smoking Included Subpopulation. Discussion: Although effective in controlling for measured confounding, PS matching may not adjust for unmeasured <b>confounders</b> that may bias the results of an economic evaluation based on nonrandomized data...|$|R

But this letter was writ in vain. Providence ordered things another way. We sailed directly for Nanquin, and in about thirteen day's sail, came to an anchor at the south-west point of the great gulf of that place, where we learned, that two Dutch ships were gone the length before us, and that we should certainly fall into their hands. We were all at a great loss in this exigency, and would very gladly have been on shore almost any where; but our old pilot told me, that if I would sail to the southward about two and forty leagues, there was a little port called Quinchange, where no European ships ever came, and where we might consider what was further to be done. Accordingly we weighed anchor the next day, calling only twice on shore by the way to get fresh water. The country people very courteously sold us roots, tea, rice, fowls, and other provisions. After five days sail we came to the port, and landed with unspeakable joy. We resolved to dispose of ourselves and effects in any other way possible, than enter on board that ill-fated vessel more; for no state can be more miserable than a continued fear, which is a life of death, a <b>confounder</b> of our understandings, that sets the imagination at work to form a thousand frightful things that may never happen. And we scarce slept one night without dreaming of halters, yard-arms, or gibbets, of fighting, being taken, and being killed; nay, so violent were our apprehensions, that we would bruise our hands and heads against the sides of the cabin, as though actually engaged. The story of the Dutch cruelty at Amboyns, often came into our thoughts when awake; and, for my part, I thought my condition very hard; that after so many difficulties and such signal deliverances, I should be hanged in my old age, though innocent of any crime that deserved such punishment; but then religion would seem to represent to me, as though the voice of it had said; 'consider, O man! what sins you have been formerly guilty of; which now thou art called to an account for, to expiate with thy blood! And as to thy innocence, what art thou more innocent than thy blessed Redeemer, Jesus Christ, who suffered for thy offences, and to whose providence you ought to submit, let what will happen?' After this, natural courage would inspire me to resist to the last drop of blood, and sooner die than suffer myself to be taken by boorish, rascally Dutchmen, who had arts to torment beyond death itself.|$|E

There has been discussion about the amount of bias in exposure effect estimates that can plausibly occur due to residual or unmeasured confounding.

40|$|PURPOSE: In {{observational}} {{studies on}} influenza vaccine effectiveness, confounding {{variables such as}} individual chronic diseases often are pooled before inclusion into a multivariable regression model. It has been suggested, however, that the pooling of <b>confounders</b> induces residual confounding, although empirical evidence is scarce. We set out to {{study the effects of}} combining several <b>confounders</b> into classes of co-morbidity. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study on the association between influenza vaccination and mortality, the effect of pooling of 20 individual diagnoses into three dichotomous co-morbidity variables indicating the presence of at least one of a range of diagnoses was studied. The sample size allowed for adjustments for 22 <b>confounders</b> (age, sex, and 20 individual cardiovascular, pulmonary, or oncologic diagnoses). RESULTS: After adjustment forage and sex, further adjustment for 20 separate <b>confounders</b> or the three pooled co-morbidity variables resulted in comparable estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness: odds ratio 0. 78 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 62 - 0. 98) and odds ratio 0. 74 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 59 - 0. 93), respectively. CONCLUSION: We conclude that pooling of several (related) <b>confounders</b> in influenza vaccine effectiveness studies in health care databases is unlikely to induce important residual confounding.
