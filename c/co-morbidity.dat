Twenty surveys were analyzed, providing results for 6,743 adult refugees from seven countries. In the larger studies, 9% were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and 5% with major depression, with evidence of much psychiatric <b>co-morbidity.</b> Five surveys of 260 refugee children from three countries yielded a prevalence of 11% for post-traumatic stress disorder.

Worldwide, tens of thousands of refugees and former refugees resettled in Western countries probably have post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E
25|$|The era {{since the}} 1980s flourished, in large part, because of {{contributions}} {{made in the}} 1970s, a decade during which child psychiatry witnessed a major evolution {{as a result of}} the work carried out by Michael Rutter. The first comprehensive population survey of 9- to 11-year-olds, carried out in London and the Isle of Wight, which appeared in 1970, addressed questions that have continued to be of importance for child psychiatry; for example, rates of psychiatric disorders, the role of intellectual development and physical impairment, and specific concern for potential social influences on children's adjustment. This work was influential, especially since the investigators demonstrated specific continuities of psychopathology over time, and the influence of social and contextual factors in children's mental health, in their subsequent re-evaluation of the original cohort of children. These studies described the prevalence of ADHD (relatively low as compared to the US), identified the onset and prevalence of depression in mid-adolescence and the frequent <b>co-morbidity</b> with conduct disorder, and explored the relationship between various mental disorders and scholastic achievemment.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{widespread}} use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in the US has resulted in diagnosis at earlier age and cancer stage, the vast majority of cases are still diagnosed in men older than 65 years, and approximately 25% of cases are diagnosed in men older than 75 years. Though US National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend using life expectancy greater than or less than 10 years to help make treatment decisions, in practice, many elderly patients are not offered curative treatment options such as radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy and are instead treated with hormonal therapy or watchful waiting. This pattern can be attributed to factors such as medical <b>co-morbidity</b> and patient preferences is regard to quality of life in addition to prostate cancer specific risk factors such as pretreatment PSA, Gleason score and clinical stage. As the average life expectancy increases due to advances in the treatment of cardiovascular, pulmonary and other chronic diseases, it is likely that more elderly patients will be living long enough to suffer the consequences of their prostate cancer. Therefore, there is currently much interest in the role of aggressive prostate cancer treatment modalities such as with surgery or radiation in the elderly population who have localized disease.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Chronic {{heart failure}} (HF) is {{frequently}} accompanied {{by one or}} more <b>co-morbidities.</b> The presence of <b>co-morbidities</b> in chronic HF is strongly correlated to HF severity and impaired outcome. AREAS COVERED: This review will address several <b>co-morbidities</b> with high prevalence and/or high impact in patients with chronic HF, including diabetes, anemia, hematinic deficiencies, and hyperkalemia. The background and subsequent pharmacotherapeutic options of these <b>co-morbidities</b> will be discussed. For this review, a MEDLINE search was performed. EXPERT OPINION: Heart failure is increasingly considered a multimorbid syndrome, including metabolic derangements and chronic inflammation. Persistent metabolic derangements and low-grade inflammation might lead to progression of HF and the development of <b>co-morbidities.</b> Although several co-morbidity-specific drugs became available in the past decade, most of these therapies are studied in relatively small cohorts using surrogate end-points. Therefore, larger studies are needed to address whether treating these <b>co-morbidities</b> will improve patient outcome in chronic HF...|$|R

25|$|RA reduces {{lifespan}} {{on average}} {{from three to}} twelve years. According to the UK's National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society, Young age at onset, long disease duration, the concurrent presence of other health problems (called <b>co-morbidity),</b> and characteristics of severe RA—such as poor functional ability or overall health status, a lot of joint damage on x-rays, the need for hospitalisation or involvement of organs other than the joints—have been shown to associate with higher mortality". Positive responses to treatment may indicate a better prognosis. A 2005 study by the Mayo Clinic noted that RA sufferers suffer a doubled risk of heart disease, independent of other risk factors such as diabetes, alcohol abuse, and elevated cholesterol, blood pressure and body mass index. The mechanism by which RA causes this increased risk remains unknown; the presence of chronic inflammation has been proposed as a contributing factor. It {{is possible that the}} use of new biologic drug therapies extend the lifespan of people with RA and reduce the risk and progression of atherosclerosis. This is based on cohort and registry studies, and still remains hypothetical. It is still uncertain whether biologics improve vascular function in RA or not. There was an increase in total cholesterol and HDLc levels and no improvement of the atherogenic index.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Mental health <b>co-morbidities</b> are {{prevalent}} in hepatitis C (HCV), and in practice often considered a contraindication for initiation of treatment. A systematic review {{was conducted to}} explore whether and how current HCV clinical practice guidelines address pre-existing mental health <b>co-morbidities.</b> METHODS A {{review of the literature}} was undertaken to identify guidelines for the management of HCV, published in English, between 2002 and January 2015. Characteristics of the guidelines were recorded and key themes on mental health were summarized across predefined stages in the patient journey (diagnosis, pre-HCV drug therapy, on HCV drug therapy, post-HCV drug therapy, advanced disease or palliative care). RESULTS Twenty-five HCV clinical guidelines were included. Referral to psychiatrist is generally recommended as pre- and in-treatment assessment of mental health <b>co-morbidities</b> but HCV guidelines do not offer explicit instructions on how to manage mental health <b>co-morbidities.</b> Post-treatment assessment of mental health <b>co-morbidities</b> were lacking.

40|$|Introduction: In the Western world, chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) is predominantly caused by long-term smoking, {{which results in}} pulmonary inflammation that is often associated with systemic inflammation. A number of co-morbid conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, muscle wasting, type 2 diabetes and asthma, may coexist with COPD; these and other <b>co-morbidities</b> not directly related to COPD are major causes of excess morbidity and mortality. Aim: This review sets out to explore the most frequent <b>co-morbidities</b> in COPD and their implications for treatment. Method: Review of the literature on <b>co-morbidities</b> of COPD. Results: <b>Co-morbidities</b> are frequent, but often remain undiagnosed in the COPD patient. In order to provide the best possible care for people with COPD, the physician should be aware of all potential <b>co-morbidities</b> that may arise, and the critical role that effective management of these <b>co-morbidities</b> can play in improving patient outcomes. Conclusions: Increased awareness of the potential <b>co-morbidities</b> of COPD, although potentially adding to the general practitioner's work burden, may provide insights into this difficult disease state and possibly improve each individual's prospects for effective management.

40|$|SummaryPatients {{with chronic}} obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) are often characterised by {{a range of}} characteristic <b>co-morbidities</b> that interfere with their pulmonary disease. In addition to a mere association with <b>co-morbidities,</b> a complex pathophysiological interaction and mutual augmentation occurs between COPD and its <b>co-morbidities</b> that may result in disease progression and increased morbidity and mortality. An interdisciplinary approach is required both for diagnosis and treatment to target <b>co-morbidities</b> early {{in the course of the}} disease. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the interaction with cerebrovascular disease and endocrinological <b>co-morbidities</b> in COPD patients. There is growing evidence that COPD is an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke, increasing the risk about twofold. Stroke risk in COPD patients increases with the severity of the disease as measured by the degree of airflow limitation. The presence of cardiovascular risk factors is of particular importance for stroke prevention in COPD patients. Endocrinological <b>co-morbidities</b> are also important and many are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Impaired glucose metabolism ranges from insulin resistance to overt diabetes mellitus, which is a frequent finding and is associated with worse outcome...|$|R

[...] The economic cost was mostly borne by individuals between 30 – 49 years old. In another study conducted with data from eight European countries, 77% of alcohol dependent patients suffered from psychiatric and somatic <b>co-morbidity,</b> which in turn increased systematic healthcare and economic cost.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There are {{a subset}} of {{potentially}} modifiable <b>co-morbidities</b> that may be targeted in the preoperative phase {{with a view to}} optimizing control and improving post-operative outcomes. This study aims to estimate the effect of potentially modifiable <b>co-morbidities</b> on post-operative outcomes and to identify potential targets for preoperative management. METHODS: Retrospective data on hospital separations in South Australia were analyzed using multiple regression to estimate the association between nine potentially modifiable <b>co-morbidities</b> and length of stay, post-operative complications and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: After adjusting for primary diagnosis, age, gender and other potential confounders, significant increases in length of stay and complications were recorded for eight and six of the nine modifiable <b>co-morbidities,</b> respectively. As examples, previous heart failure was associated with a 54 % increase in length of stay and an odds ratio of 1. 75 for complications. Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was associated with a 38 % increase in length of stay and an odds ratio of 1. 64 for complications. CONCLUSIONS: A set of potentially modifiable <b>co-morbidities</b> is associated with a range of poorer post-operative outcomes, relative to patients without those <b>co-morbidities.</b> There is a clinical rationale that outcomes will be worse in the subset of patients for whom such <b>co-morbidities</b> are poorly controlled, and that timely intervention to improve control in the period prior to surgery will improve post-operative outcomes. Further research is required on post-operative outcomes for patients with and without controlled <b>co-morbidities</b> and on the effects of timely intervention to improve control prior to surgery.

This study uses a microsimulation model, Health&WealthMOD, to quantify the impact of <b>co-morbidities</b> on the labour force participation and economic circumstances of 45 - to 64 -year-old Australians with arthritis. The {{results show that the}} probability of being out of the labour force increases with increasing number of <b>co-morbidities.</b> However, there was no statistically significant difference in the amount of weekly private income received by people with arthritis and no <b>co-morbidities,</b> and people with arthritis and one or two <b>co-morbidities.</b> However, those with arthritis and three or more <b>co-morbidities</b> received a weekly private income 72 % lower than people with arthritis alone (95 % CI − 82, − 57).
