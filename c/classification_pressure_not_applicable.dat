30|$|Two {{major factors}} are {{required}} for changing the slip direction of olivine from [100] to [001] - namely, water (Jung and Karato 2001 a; Jung et al. 2006) and pressure (Mainprice et al. 2005; Jung et al. 2009; Ohuchi et al. 2011). Of these two factors, <b>pressure</b> is <b>not</b> <b>applicable</b> in this study. Jung et al. (2009) reported that the LPO of olivine changes from A- to B-type at pressures in excess of 3  GPa. This pressure corresponds {{to a depth of}} approximately 90  km. Ohuchi et al. (2011) also reported that the B-type LPO of olivine was formed at even higher pressures, about 7  GPa at T[*]=[*] 1, 220 °C and 1, 400 °C. However, for the anorthosite bodies in the Lindås Nappe complex surrounding the samples, the Grenvillian orogeny occurred at a pressure of 1  GPa and the Caledonian orogeny occurred at 1.5 to 2.1  GPa (Austrheim and Griffin 1985; Glodny et al. 2008; Jamtveit et al. 1990). In both cases, the pressure was less than 3  GPa, and hence, <b>pressure</b> alone could <b>not</b> have changed the easiest slip direction of olivine in the study area.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe pressure-dependent {{diffusion}} and partitioning {{of single}} lipid fluorophores in DMPC and DPPC monolayers were investigated {{with the use}} of a custom-made monolayer trough mounted on a combined fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and wide-field microscopy setup. It is shown that lipid diffusion, which is essential for the function of biological membranes, is heavily influenced by the lateral pressure and phase of the lipid structure. Both of these may change dynamically during, e. g., protein adsorption and desorption processes. Using FCS, we measured lipid diffusion coefficients over a wide range of lateral pressures in DMPC monolayers and fitted them to a free-area model as well as the direct experimental observable mean molecular area. FCS measurements on DPPC monolayers were also performed below the onset of the phase transition (Π < 5 mN/m). At higher <b>pressures,</b> FCS was <b>not</b> <b>applicable</b> for measuring diffusion coefficients in DPPC monolayers. Single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry clearly showed that this was due to heterogeneous partitioning of the lipid fluorophores in condensed phases. The results were compared with dye partitioning in giant lipid vesicles. These findings are significant in relation to the application of lipid fluorophores to study diffusion in both model systems and biological systems...|$|R
