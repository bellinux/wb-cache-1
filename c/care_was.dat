The ship, together with its 205-strong crew, had been loaned by the Royal Navy for the occasion.|$|E
5|$|After the Civil War, Powell {{was made}} a baronet by Charles II. Although it is {{unrecorded}} when Bodiam Castle was dismantled (slighted), it was probably after it was bought by Powell. During and after the Civil War, many castles were slighted {{to prevent them from}} being reused. Not all were destroyed completely, and in some cases <b>care</b> <b>was</b> taken not to unnecessarily deface the structure. At Bodiam, it was deemed sufficient to dismantle the barbican, the bridges, and the buildings inside the castle. When Nathaniel Powell died in 1674 or 1675, Bodiam Castle was passed on to his son, also called Nathaniel. After the second Nathaniel, the castle came into the possession of Elizabeth Clitherow, his daughter-in-law.|$|E

He would learn throughout his life to speak and write not only his native Portuguese, but also Latin, French, German, English, Italian, Spanish, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Sanskrit, Chinese, Occitan and a Tupi–Guarani language. His passion for reading allowed him to assimilate any information. Pedro II, was not a genius, although he was intelligent and possessed a facility for accumulating knowledge.|$|E
5000|$|The vast {{majority}} of children who would otherwise need foster <b>care</b> <b>are</b> in kinship <b>care,</b> that <b>is,</b> in the <b>care</b> of grandparents or other relatives. [...] Most kinship <b>care</b> <b>is</b> done informally, without the involvement of a court or public organization. However, in the U.S., formal kinship <b>care</b> <b>is</b> increasingly common. In 2012, {{a quarter of all}} children in formal foster <b>care</b> <b>were</b> placed with relatives.|$|R
5000|$|Ordinary and {{extraordinary}} <b>care</b> <b>are</b> distinguished by some bioethical theories, including {{the teaching of}} the Catholic Church.

40|$|Using {{spiritual and}} {{religious}} resources gives {{patients and families}} strength to cope during a crisis, but nurses often do not offer spiritual care (Kloosterhouse 2 ̆ 6 Ames, 2002). The purpose of this phenomenological {{study was to explore}} nurses 2 ̆ 2 lived experience of giving spiritual care. A descriptive phenomenological approach was used to interview 4 nurses. Data were analyzed using Colaizzi 2 ̆ 7 s (1978) phenomenological method. Five themes <b>were</b> identified: spiritual <b>care</b> <b>is</b> patient-centered, spiritual <b>care</b> <b>is</b> an important part of nursing, spiritual <b>care</b> can <b>be</b> simple to give, spiritual <b>care</b> <b>is</b> not expected but is welcomed by patients, and spiritual <b>care</b> <b>is</b> given by diverse caregivers. Spiritual <b>care</b> <b>is</b> an integral part of nursing and nurses can support patients with spiritual interventions...|$|R

According to Paul the queen then {{recruited}} the king's cubicularius (bedchamberlain), Peredeo, into the plot, after having seduced him. When Alboin retired for his midday rest on June 28, <b>care</b> <b>was</b> taken to leave {{the door open and}} unguarded. Alboin's sword was also removed, leaving him defenceless when Peredeo entered his room and killed him. Alboin's remains were allegedly buried beneath the palace steps.|$|E
5|$|Several {{institutions}} bear her name, {{starting with}} the two Curie institutes – the Maria Skłodowska–Curie Institute of Oncology, in Warsaw; and the Institut Curie in Paris. She is the patron of Maria Curie-Skłodowska University, in Lublin, founded in 1944; and of Pierre and Marie Curie University (Paris VI), France's pre-eminent science university.

5|$|The {{dimensions}} of a Book of the Dead could vary widely; the longest is 40m long while some are {{as short as}} 1m. They are composed of sheets of papyrus joined together, the individual papyri varying in width from 15cm to 45cm. The scribes working on Book of the Dead papyri took more care over their work than those working on more mundane texts; <b>care</b> <b>was</b> taken to frame the text within margins, and to avoid writing on the joints between sheets. The words peret em heru, or 'coming forth by day' sometimes appear on the reverse of the outer margin, perhaps acting as a label.|$|E
50|$|Breeder costs {{consist of}} {{prenatal}} care, postnatal {{care and maintenance}} of breeding status. Prenatal <b>care</b> <b>is</b> the amount of maternal investment during fetus gestation and postnatal <b>care</b> <b>is</b> the investment following birth. Examples of prenatal <b>care</b> <b>are</b> fetal, placentae, uterus and mammary tissue development. Postnatal examples are lactation, food provisions and guarding behavior.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} fairly weigh whether in {{absentia}} <b>care</b> <b>is</b> beneficial or dangerous, {{it is helpful}} to examine the past, because remote <b>care</b> <b>is</b> not simply a phenomenon of the cyber era.

50|$|The {{cost-effectiveness}} {{of preventive}} <b>care</b> <b>is</b> a highly debated topic.

5|$|The {{station was}} opened as Westminster Bridge on 24 December 1868 by the steam-operated District Railway (DR) (now the District line) when the railway opened {{the first section}} of its line from South Kensington. It was {{originally}} the eastern terminus of the DR and the station cutting ended at a concrete wall buffered by timber sleepers. The approach to the station from the west runs in cut and cover tunnel under the roadway of Broad Sanctuary and diagonally under Parliament Square. In Broad Sanctuary the tunnel is close to Westminster Abbey and St Margaret's church and <b>care</b> <b>was</b> required to avoid undermining their foundations when excavating in the poor ground found there.|$|E
5|$|After a {{few days}} out of the line, the {{battalion}} resumed its advance on 20 April with the 6th Brigade, still as its reserve. However, {{a few days}} later the vehicle in which Norman, the battalion's commander, was travelling ran over a landmine. Norman was wounded and had to be medically evacuated. He was replaced by the second-in-command of the 26th Battalion, Major A. Barnett, who was promoted to lieutenant colonel. The advance continued, effectively unopposed, with the 25th Battalion leading. Despite expecting the worst, it crossed the Po River with minimal difficulty on 25 April and the Adige River was traversed the next day, again with relative ease. The 9th Infantry Brigade then took over the advance, with the 6th Brigade taking over as the divisional reserve. Although the war was nearly over, <b>care</b> <b>was</b> still required as the battalion moved forward through the towns of Padua and Gorizia, before the surrender of all German forces in Italy on 2 May.|$|E
50|$|Home care, (also {{referred}} to as domiciliary care, social care, or in-home <b>care),</b> <b>is</b> supportive <b>care</b> provided in the home. <b>Care</b> may <b>be</b> provided by licensed healthcare professionals who provide medical care needs or by professional caregivers who provide daily care to help to ensure the {{activities of daily living}} (ADLs) are met. In home medical <b>care</b> <b>is</b> often and more accurately {{referred to}} as home health care or formal care. Often, the term home health <b>care</b> <b>is</b> used to distinguish it from non-medical care, custodial care, or private-duty <b>care</b> which <b>is</b> <b>care</b> that <b>is</b> provided by persons who are not nurses, doctors, or other licensed medical personnel.|$|R

5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the hospice {{philosophy}} <b>is</b> that the <b>care</b> <b>is</b> patient-centered, to treat the whole patient. Many healthcare agencies in the US market themselves as patient-centered; for hospice, this patient-directed <b>care</b> <b>is</b> integral and interwoven throughout the <b>care</b> which <b>is</b> provided. Related Medicare regulations reflect this philosophy.|$|R
5|$|Another {{widespread}} trait among modern birds is {{parental care}} for young after hatching. Jack Horner's 1978 {{discovery of a}} Maiasaura ("good mother lizard") nesting ground in Montana demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among ornithopods, suggesting this behavior might also have been common to all dinosaurs. There is evidence that other non-theropod dinosaurs, like Patagonian titanosaurian sauropods, also nested in large groups. A specimen of the Mongolian oviraptorid Citipati osmolskae was discovered in a chicken-like brooding position in 1993, which may indicate that they had begun using an insulating layer of feathers to keep the eggs warm. Parental care being a trait common to all dinosaurs is supported by other finds. For example, a dinosaur embryo (pertaining to the prosauropod Massospondylus) was found without teeth, indicating that some parental <b>care</b> <b>was</b> required to feed the young dinosaurs. Trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among ornithopods from the Isle of Skye in northwestern Scotland. Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely that all dinosaurs cared for their young to some extent either before or shortly after hatching.|$|E
5|$|Castro's {{government}} emphasised social {{projects to}} improve Cuba's standard of living, often {{to the detriment}} of economic development. Major emphasis was placed on education, and during the first 30 months of Castro's government, more classrooms were opened than in the previous 30 years. The Cuban primary education system offered a work-study program, with half of the time spent in the classroom, and the other half in a productive activity. Health <b>care</b> <b>was</b> nationalized and expanded, with rural health centers and urban polyclinics opening up across the island to offer free medical aid. Universal vaccination against childhood diseases was implemented, and infant mortality rates were reduced dramatically. A third part of this social program was the improvement of infrastructure. Within {{the first six months of}} Castro's government, 600 miles of roads were built across the island, while $300 million was spent on water and sanitation projects. Over 800 houses were constructed every month in the early years of the administration in an effort to cut homelessness, while nurseries and day-care centers were opened for children and other centers opened for the disabled and elderly.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{practical}} limitations {{of meetings with}} 74 members {{on a regular basis}} (the total number of members from the five Chambers), the Charter called for a board of directors comprising nineteen members of the five Chambers. Van Rensselaer was chosen a member of this College of XIX, as it was called. It is said that <b>care</b> <b>was</b> exercised in the selection of the directors of each chamber, and only men of wealth and the highest known integrity were eligible for the trust. Van Rensselaer was apparently known as an unusually clear-headed man and an able and practical merchant who did not limit himself to his own branch of trade. These qualities presumably garnered the trust needed to be elected to the College of XIX.|$|E
40|$|Access to palliative <b>care</b> <b>is</b> unequally {{distributed}} across Sweden {{and thus}} {{does not meet}} the needs. The holistic perspective of palliative <b>care</b> <b>is</b> sometimes contrasted with the usual medical focus on organ failure and disease. Palliative consultation teams provide specialist palliative care competencies for staff caring for patients in primary care, nursing homes and in hospitals. Efforts to increase knowledge and skills in palliative <b>care</b> <b>is</b> needed at undergraduate university level and through postgraduate and specialist training. Well organized cooperation between municipalities, county councils and primary <b>care</b> <b>is</b> crucial for patients {{in the final stages of}} life...|$|R

5|$|Early in 1794, {{engraver}} Robert Scot began preparing {{designs for}} the silver dollar. Scot's initial design depicted a bust of Liberty, while his reverse featured an eagle, both required by the 1792 Coinage Act. Scot's design closely followed his design for the cent, but with the Phrygian cap removed. Government officials later instructed Scot to include a wreath around the eagle and to move the denomination from the reverse face {{to the edge of}} the coin. After receiving approval, Scot began engraving the hubs for the new silver dollar. Extra <b>care</b> <b>was</b> taken during the engraving of this denomination, because the dollar would be the largest American coin, and would thus receive the most scrutiny from foreign nations. The lettering was executed by Frederick Geiger, who had worked as a typographer for various books and newspapers. After the dies were created, several copper test pieces were struck. Officials decided to add fifteen stars around the periphery, representing the fifteen states that had ratified the Constitution to that point, to the right-facing Liberty on the obverse.|$|E
5|$|Hospice {{care in the}} United States is a {{type and}} {{philosophy}} of end-of-life care which focuses on the palliation of a terminally ill patient's symptoms. These symptoms can be physical, emotional, spiritual or social in nature. The concept of hospice {{as a place to}} treat the incurably ill has been evolving since the 11th century. Hospice <b>care</b> <b>was</b> introduced to the United States in the 1970s in response to the work of Cicely Saunders in the United Kingdom. This part of health care has expanded as people face a variety of issues with terminal illness. In the United States, it is distinguished by extensive use of volunteers and a greater emphasis on the patient's psychological needs in coming to terms with dying.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} summer of 1920, a total of 50,028 Maine Centennial half dollars were {{produced}} at the Philadelphia Mint, including 28 pieces reserved for inspection and testing at the 1921 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. No special <b>care</b> <b>was</b> taken in the minting; they were ejected into bins and many display bag marks. They were sent to Maine and placed on sale through the Office of the State Treasurer at a price of $1. Thirty thousand sold immediately and they remained on sale through the treasurer's office until all fifty thousand were vended, though this did not happen until at least 1929. Bowers speculated that had the full 100,000 authorized coins been struck, most of the additional quantity would have been returned to the Mint and melted for lack of buyers. Many pieces were spent {{in the years after}} 1920 and entered circulation.|$|E

40|$|This paper clarifies the {{relationship}} between an injurer 2 ̆ 7 s wealth level and his care choice by highlighting the distinction between monetary and non-monetary <b>care.</b> When <b>care</b> <b>is</b> non-monetary, wealth-constrained injurers generally take less than optimal <b>care,</b> and <b>care</b> <b>is</b> increasing in their wealth level under both strict liability and negligence. In contrast, when <b>care</b> <b>is</b> monetary, injurers may take {{too much or too}} little care under strict liability, and <b>care</b> <b>is</b> not strictly increasing in injurer wealth. Under negligence, {{the relationship}} between injurer <b>care</b> and wealth <b>is</b> similar in the two formulations. However, when litigation costs are added to the model, {{the relationship between}} injurer care and wealth becomes non-monotonic under both liability rules...|$|R

5|$|The {{film was}} {{produced}} in Telugu and Tamil versions, with a slightly different cast for each. Gemini Ganesan appeared as Abhimanyu in the Tamil version, which was portrayed by Akkineni Nageswara Rao in Telugu. Savitri was retained as the female lead in Tamil also, where her character was named Vatsala instead of Sasirekha. Sachu played the younger version of the character in Tamil. N. T. Rama Rao, hesitant to play Krishna after a negative response to his cameo appearance in Sontha Ooru (1956), agreed at Venkata Reddy's insistence and special <b>care</b> <b>was</b> taken with his costume and body language; Mayabazar {{was the first of}} Rama Rao's many appearances as Krishna. According to Rama Rao's widow Lakshmi Parvathi, Nagi Reddy and Chakrapani had initially rejected Venkata Reddy's proposal to cast Rama Rao as Krishna, but he persuaded them into believing that Rama Rao was good for the role. As Rama Rao had a broad chest, Venkata Reddy suggested a slight narrowing to look apt as Krishna. In addition to following other suggestions by Venkata Reddy, Rama Rao read the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata and other puranas to understand Krishna's character and present it properly. S. V. Ranga Rao, described by Nageswara Rao as the film's male lead in interviews, played the character of Ghatotkacha.|$|E
5|$|The first {{enlisted men}} to be {{recruited}} in 1873 came {{from a wide variety}} of backgrounds, but most had some military experience. Many of the men enlisting in this tranche were later dismissed as unsuitable for service, less than half completing their term of enlistment, and more <b>care</b> <b>was</b> taken in later recruiting. Initially, a majority of the force were of Canadian origin but the number originating from Britain rose steadily during the 1880s until they made up over half of all new recruits, with British-born mounted police also tending to predominate in the non-commissioned cadre, mainly because they chose to stay longer in the force. Although the number of Canadian-born recruits increased for a while, the economic boom of the 1910s made the task much harder, and the mounted police opened a recruitment office in London; by 1914 almost 80 percent of the force had been born in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The magazines, {{situated}} deep {{under the}} casemates, consist of alternating pairs of shell and cartridge rooms accessed via an ammunition passage {{at the front}} and a lighting passage behind. Great <b>care</b> <b>was</b> taken to reduce {{the possibility of an}} accidental explosion. The magazine workers wore special clothes and shoes to eliminate the risk of striking sparks and the floors of the cartridge stores were covered by wooden battens. The lighting was provided from oil lamps situated behind glass windows and accessed only from the lighting passage, which was physically separated {{from the rest of the}} magazine. Sets of lifting gear enabled the workers to winch the cartridges and ammunition up to the casemates, with which they could communicate via voice tubes.|$|E

40|$|Using {{data from}} a 1974 {{household}} survey, accessibility to ambulatory <b>care</b> <b>is</b> compared for residents of an inner-city area (East Baltimore) whose usual source of <b>care</b> <b>is</b> an HMO (the East Baltimore Medical Plan) and residents of the same area with other usual sources of <b>care.</b> Accessibility <b>is</b> measured by the probability of receiving care for an episode of illness. Results from multivariate linear and probit regressions indicate that children using the HMO {{are more likely to}} receive <b>care</b> than <b>are</b> children with other usual care sources, but no significant differences in the probability of receiving <b>care</b> <b>are</b> found among adults. Evidence of a substitution of telephone care for in-person <b>care</b> <b>is</b> also found among persons using the HMO. Data from a 1971 household survey of the same area suggest that selectivity is not an important confounding factor in the analysis...|$|R
