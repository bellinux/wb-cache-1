5|$|The crown-of-thorns starfish, {{like other}} starfish such as Metrodira subulata, has <b>conspicuous</b> {{coloration}} and <b>conspicuous</b> long, sharp spines, {{as well as}} chemical defences {{in the form of}} saponins; this evidence is argued to be sufficient for such species to be considered aposematic.|$|E
5|$|A large, <b>conspicuous</b> mushroom, Amanita muscaria is {{generally}} common and numerous where it grows, {{and is often}} found in groups with basidiocarps in all stages of development.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{clothing}} and accessories, some other well-known brands are <b>conspicuous</b> in the film.|$|E
5|$|Marsupials such as opossums and {{the common}} brushtail possum have also {{developed}} noticeable sublingua with a plica mediana and a less specialized, but <b>conspicuous,</b> plica fimbriata.|$|E
5|$|Pallidus group: Species with <b>conspicuous,</b> long, downward-pointing hairs, and {{a smooth}} (non-plicate) inner peridium.|$|E
5|$|The oystercatchers are large, <b>conspicuous</b> {{and noisy}} plover-like birds, with strong bills used for smashing or prising open molluscs.|$|E
5|$|When {{using its}} own web to catch {{other species of}} salticids, P. fimbriata conceals its <b>conspicuous</b> palps, which it does not do when {{stalking}} a web-spider or occasionally a moving fly.|$|E
5|$|White-tailed {{deer and}} other prey mammals flag with <b>conspicuous</b> (often black and white) tail {{markings}} when alarmed, informing the predator {{that it has}} been detected.|$|E
5|$|After his censure, McCarthy {{continued}} senatorial duties {{for another}} {{two and a half}} years, but his career as a major public figure had been unmistakably ruined. His colleagues in the Senate avoided him; his speeches on the Senate floor were delivered to a near-empty chamber or were received with <b>conspicuous</b> displays of inattention.|$|E
5|$|Agonistic vocalisations: Eklund {{used this}} term as a {{reference}} to a combination of growls, moans, and hisses that is followed by spitting, a feature more <b>conspicuous</b> in cheetah than in other cats. In addition to spitting, the cheetah will hit the ground with its front paws.|$|E
5|$|Also defined herewith: orbital ring. A visible ring of {{feathers}} around a bird's eye; the eye-ring is often paler than the surrounding feathers. By contrast, an orbital ring is bare skin ringing the eye. In some species, such as little ringed plover, the orbital ring {{may be quite}} <b>conspicuous.</b>|$|E
5|$|Among moths with deimatic behaviour, the {{eyed hawkmoth}} (Smerinthus ocellatus) {{displays}} its large eyespots, moving them slowly {{as if it}} were a vertebrate predator such as an owl. Among butterflies, the peacock butterfly Aglais io is a cryptic leaf mimic with wings closed, but displays 4 <b>conspicuous</b> eyespots when disturbed, in a display effective against insectivorous birds (flycatchers).|$|E
5|$|Andean {{cocks-of-the-rock}} face {{slightly larger}} predators than smaller songbirds. Predators {{are attracted to}} leks by the <b>conspicuous</b> behavior of the displaying males. The animals reported to prey on adult cocks-of-the-rock including hawk-eagles, hawks, forest-falcons, jaguar, mountain lion, ocelot and the boa constrictor.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{coloration}} is {{the general}} appearance of an animal resulting from the reflection or emission of light from its surfaces. Some animals are brightly coloured, while others are hard to see. In some species, such as the peafowl, the male has strong patterns, <b>conspicuous</b> colours and is iridescent, while the female is far less visible.|$|E
5|$|Aposematic species do {{not need}} to hide or stay still as cryptic organisms do, so aposematic {{individuals}} benefit from more freedom in exposed areas and can spend more time foraging, allowing them to find more and better quality food. Aposematic individuals can similarly make use of <b>conspicuous</b> mating displays.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism is {{paradoxical}} {{in evolutionary}} terms, {{as it makes}} individuals <b>conspicuous</b> to predators, so they may be killed and the trait eliminated before predators learn to avoid it. If warning colouration puts the first few individuals at such a strong disadvantage, it would never last in the species long enough to become beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Attalea {{includes}} both large trees and small acaulescent palms which occupy {{a number of}} different ecological niches. Dense stands of some of the larger species are <b>conspicuous</b> elements on the landscape, while smaller species are found in both in the forest understorey and in savannas.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes are {{territorial}} on {{the breeding}} grounds, with distinctive threat displays, but are more gregarious during migration and in wintering areas. Pairs {{stay in their}} territory throughout the year where the climate is sufficiently temperate. This common and <b>conspicuous</b> species {{has given rise to}} a number of literary and cultural references, frequently related to its song.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{is given}} that <b>conspicuous</b> {{animals such as}} {{caterpillars}} really are distasteful. Animals with actual poisons are discussed, and how these are secreted, used in bites and stings, or kept to make the animal bitter tasting.|$|E
5|$|For <b>conspicuous</b> bravery near Festubert on 24 November 1914, in {{entering}} a German sap and destroying a traverse {{in the face}} of the enemy's bombs, and for subsequently rescuing, under heavy fire, a wounded man who was lying exposed in the open.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the Albert Bridge was rewired {{and painted}} {{in an unusual}} colour scheme {{designed}} {{to make it more}} <b>conspicuous</b> in poor visibility, and avoid being damaged by ships. At night it is illuminated by 4,000bulbs, making it one of west London's most striking landmarks. In 2010â€“2011, these were replaced with LEDs.|$|E
5|$|Like the French, the German air {{services}} used {{a variety}} of disruptive camouflage patterns until April 1917, when lozenge camouflage was introduced; it used up to five colors. German aircraft were however sometimes painted in deliberately <b>conspicuous</b> colors, like the bright red of Manfred von Richthofen's Albatros D.III, advertising the pilot's prowess to intimidate the enemy.|$|E
5|$|Many animals, {{including}} moths, butterflies, mantises, phasmids, and cephalopods such as octopuses, {{make use}} of patterns of threatening or startling behaviour, such as suddenly displaying <b>conspicuous</b> eyespots, so as to scare off or momentarily distract a predator, thus giving the prey animal an opportunity to escape.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species in}} this order have five arms and {{two rows of}} tube feet with suckers. There are <b>conspicuous</b> {{marginal}} plates on the arms and disc. Some species have paxillae and in some, the main pedicellariae are clamp-like and recessed into the skeletal plates. This group includes the cushion stars, the leather star and the sea daisies.|$|E
5|$|Richardson's last stage role of {{the decade}} was in 1969, as Dr Rance in What the Butler Saw by Joe Orton. It was a <b>conspicuous</b> failure. The public hated the play and made the fact vociferously clear at the first night.|$|E
5|$|Solitary animals {{defend a}} {{territory}} and avoid social {{interactions with the}} members of its species, except during breeding season. This is to avoid resource competition, as two individuals of the same species would occupy the same niche, and to prevent depletion of food. A solitary animal, while foraging, can also be less <b>conspicuous</b> to predators or prey.|$|E
5|$|Squamous-cell {{carcinoma}} {{accounts for}} about 30% of lung cancers. They typically occur close to large airways. A hollow cavity and associated cell death are commonly found {{at the center of}} the tumor. About 9% of lung cancers are large-cell carcinoma. These are so named because the cancer cells are large, with excess cytoplasm, large nuclei and <b>conspicuous</b> nucleoli.|$|E
5|$|The Red Spot was {{reportedly}} lost from sight {{on several occasions}} between 1665 and 1708 before becoming quite <b>conspicuous</b> in 1878. It was recorded as fading again in 1883 and {{at the start of}} the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The body becomes wider {{towards the}} head, {{which has a}} <b>conspicuous</b> mandibular groove. It also bears a pair of stalked {{compound}} eyes, {{as well as a}} sessile median eye, two pairs of antennae, and the mouthparts. The mouthparts comprise a labrum, directed backwards over the mouth and pairs of mandibles, paragnatha, maxillules and vestigial maxillae.|$|E
5|$|The central adrenomedullary vein, in the adrenal medulla, is {{an unusual}} type of blood vessel. Its {{structure}} {{is different from the}} other veins in that the smooth muscle in its tunica media (the middle layer of the vessel) is arranged in <b>conspicuous,</b> longitudinally oriented bundles.|$|E
5|$|The {{typical owls}} are small to large solitary nocturnal birds of prey. They have large {{forward-facing}} eyes and ears, a hawk-like beak and a <b>conspicuous</b> circle of feathers around each eye called a facial disk.|$|E
5|$|The {{typical owls}} are small to large solitary nocturnal birds of prey. They have large {{forward-facing}} eyes and ears, a hawk-like beak and a <b>conspicuous</b> circle of feathers around each eye called a facial disk. One species {{has been recorded}} in Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|The {{typical owls}} are small to large solitary nocturnal birds of prey. They have large {{forward-facing}} eyes and ears, a hawk-like beak, and a <b>conspicuous</b> circle of feathers around each eye called a facial disk.|$|E
5|$|The {{typical owls}} are small-to-large solitary nocturnal birds of prey. They have large {{forward-facing}} eyes and ears, a hawk-like beak, and a <b>conspicuous</b> circle of feathers around each eye called a facial disk. Eight {{species have been}} recorded in Maryland.|$|E
5|$|This <b>conspicuous</b> yellow bird has {{inspired}} poems by Robbie Burns and John Clare, and its characteristic song has influenced works by Beethoven and Messiaen. The children's writer Enid Blyton helped to popularise the standard English {{representation of the}} song.|$|E
5|$|Typical owls {{are small}} to large solitary nocturnal birds of prey. They have large {{forward-facing}} eyes and ears, a hawk-like beak and a <b>conspicuous</b> circle of feathers around each eye called a facial disc. There are about 199 species worldwide, with four recorded in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
