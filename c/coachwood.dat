25|$|Impressive {{groves of}} {{turpentine}} (Syncarpia glomulifera) and blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis) trees {{may be seen}} growing straight {{up into the sky}} forming an open canopy with widely spaced trunks. In these characteristic areas they are generally considered open forest, they may have a grassy understory, a sclerophyll shrubbery or alternatively they may have a rainforest subcanopy or a rainforest understory with growth being densest nearest to the valley floor or permanent watercourses. In these turpentine forests often hundreds of cabbage palms (Livistona australis) may be seen growing in dense tall thickets which are rarely touched by fire or they may exist as young plants in open grassy spaces which are burnt regularly enough not to form visible trunks. Rainforest pockets are dominated by jackwood and sassafras. The lilli pilli (Acmena smithii) produces a fruit edible raw. Another common species is the <b>coachwood</b> (Ceratopetalum apetalum) which were used extensively from Australian rainforests to manufacture horse-drawn coaches.|$|E
