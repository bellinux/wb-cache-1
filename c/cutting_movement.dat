40|$|BACKGROUND: A custom moulded ankle {{orthosis}} with hinged joints potentially {{offers a}} better {{control over the}} subtalar joint and the ankle joint during lateral <b>cutting</b> <b>movements,</b> due to total contact design and increase in material strength. OBJECTIVES: To test the above hypothesis by comparing it to three other available orthoses. STUDY DESIGN: Repeated measures. METHODS: Eight subjects {{with a history of}} ankle sprains (Grade 2), and 11 subjects without such history performed lateral <b>cutting</b> <b>movements</b> in four test conditions: 1) non-orthotic, 2) custom-moulded ankle orthosis with hinges, 3) Sport-Stirrup, and 4) elastic ankle sleeve with plastic support. A VICON motion analysis system was used to study the motions at the ankle and subtalar joints. RESULTS: The custom-moulded ankle orthosis significantly lowered the inversion angle at initial contact (p = 0. 006) and the peak inversion angle (p = 0. 000) during lateral <b>cutting</b> <b>movements</b> in comparison to non-orthotic condition, while the other two orthoses did not. The three orthoses did not affect the plantarflexion motions, which had been suggested by previous studies to be important in shock wave attenuation. CONCLUSIONS: The custom-moulded ankle orthosis with hinges could better control inversion and thus expected to better prevent ankle sprain in lateral <b>cutting</b> <b>movements.</b> CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Custom-moulded ankle orthoses are not commonly used in preventing ankle sprains.

40|$|AbstractCutting {{movements}} in football (soccer) induce high loads on the {{anterior cruciate ligament}} in the knee. The injury risk {{is affected by the}} shoe-surface interaction. For the evaluation of different influencing factors of this interaction the TrakTester, a custom-made device, was used. To obtain significant results from testing ACL loading a realistic plantar pressure distribution in the shoe is required. Using the TrakTester several <b>cutting</b> <b>movements</b> were carried out using two different foot models with the resultant plantar pressure analysed with three different systems: The original foot model with Parotec insoles (24 integrated sensors; Paromed GmbH, Markt Neubeuern, Germany), the modified version of this foot model with Pedar-X insoles (99 sensors; novel GmbH, Munich, Germany) and the inflexible model was surveyed with the OpenGo science system (13 sensors, Moticon, Munich, Germany). For the inflexible model distinct angles between the lower leg and the surface were adjusted and the obtained plantar pressure distributions were analyzed. As the first version showed high pressures in the arch region, it was modified to reduce the load in this area. A second inflexible model induced the pressure in the heel and forefoot region. For various angles similar plantar pressure distributions were obtained. Highest pressures were applied on the medial side of the heel and forefoot with minor load in the arch region. This corresponds to literature data investigating <b>cutting</b> <b>movements</b> with subjects. Tests with the inflexible foot model achieved similar and realistic patterns of the plantar pressure distribution for different angles. This is an important precondition to obtain reproducible data for ACL loading during <b>cutting</b> <b>movements...</b>|$|R

Interestingly, a greater horizontal propulsion impulse was found with the SCS during 45 -degree cutting (P    0. 05).

40|$|An {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) tear is a debilitating injury that occurs in {{tens of thousands of}} athletes per year, often requiring surgery and long stints of rehabilitation. A major sports movement that can cause an ACL tear is the noncontact, lateral <b>cutting</b> <b>movement.</b> Different variables associated with this movement have been shown to manipulate the stresses and body angles of the hip, knee and ankle joints. Some of these manipulations can lead to an increased risk of ACL injuries. One such variable, first tested by Mclean et al (2004), is the incorporation of a defender in front of the cutting participant. In our study, 10 participants performed the <b>cutting</b> <b>movement</b> at 45 ° at a controlled velocity under 4 different conditions: with no defender present, with a stationary defender present, with a defender moving slightly forward, and with a defender moving to the left. With the use of reflective markers, motion detecting video cameras and a force platform, kinetic and kinematic data were collected at the ankle, knee and hip joints.

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Fast medio-lateral movements, {{frequent}} in {{a number}} of sports activities, are associated with lower extremity injuries. These injuries may occur as a result of excessive musculoskeletal stresses on the joints and their associate structures. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effect of running speed and turning movement on the three-dimensional moments at the ankle, knee, and hip joints. Data were collected using video cameras and force plate. Eight male recreational basketball players were tested during slow (1. 5 m/s), moderate (3. 0 m/s), and fast running (4. 5 m/s) and when cutting to the right or left (+ 60, + 30, 0, - 30, and - 60 °). The inverse dynamics approach was used to integrate the body segment parameter, kinematic and force plate data, and to solve the resultant joint moments. At the ankle joint, inversion/eversion, dorsi/plantar flexion, and internal/external rotation moments of the ankle joint increased with running speed (p<. 05). At the knee joint, flexion/extension and abduction/adduction moments increased with running speed except flexion moment that decreased with running speed (p<. 05). At the hip joint, internal/external rotation, flexion/extension, and abduction/adduction moments increased with running speed (p<. 05). In medial <b>cutting</b> <b>movements,</b> greater abduction moments of the ankle, adduction moments of the knee and external rotation and adduction of the hip were found (p<. 05). In lateral <b>cutting</b> <b>movements,</b> greater inversion and adduction moments of the ankle, abduction moments of the knee and hip were found (p<. 05). These findings reinforce the intuitive notion that fast medio-lateral turning movements produce substantially greater musculoskeletal loading on the joint structures than does straight running and consequently have greater potential for inducing lower extremity injuries such as ankle sprain or anterior cruciate ligament injury...|$|R

50|$|Women {{have been}} known to suffer ACL {{injuries}} more frequently than men; current research gives some explanations for this. The joint through which the anterior cruciate ligament passes, along with the actual size of the anterior cruciate ligament, is significantly smaller in women than in men. This makes it more susceptible to damage. Along with these aspects, women tend to not activate their hamstring muscles as much as their male counterparts during certain <b>cutting</b> <b>movements</b> causing less stability in the knee joint. In addition, the quadriceps angle, or Q-angle, between the anterior superior iliac spine and patellar ligament may contribute to the predisposition of ACL tears. There is some evidence that suggests since women are known to have larger Q-angles than their male counterparts, they might be more susceptible to ACL tears.|$|R

The aim of the current investigation was to examine the influence of high and low cut American football specific footwear on tibial accelerations and three-dimensional (3 D) kinematics during three sport specific movements. Twelve male American football players performed three movements, run, cut and vertical jump whilst wearing both low and high cut footwear. 3 D kinematics of the lower extremities were measured using an eight-camera motion analysis system alongside tibial acceleration parameters which were obtained using a shank mounted accelerometer. Tibial acceleration and 3 D kinematic differences between the different footwear were examined using either repeated measures or Friedman’s ANOVA. Tibial accelerations were significantly greater in the low cut footwear in comparison to the high cut footwear for the run and cut movements.

30|$|Parkour {{can also}} help develop an athlete’s {{capacity}} to effectively use turning and <b>cutting</b> <b>movements,</b> suggested as a critical skill in team sports [20]. Parkour practitioners target improvements in turning ability and spatial awareness using the ‘tic tac’ technique, during which athletes have to approach obstacles and take off with a change of direction. The intention here is for the athlete to clear the obstacles or use perceptual variables, such as time to contact with the object, to regulate {{the next phase of}} movement [21]. A shared task goal in parkour and team sports is to react to perturbations in a performance environment, and the ‘tic tac’ activity could transfer between athlete development programmes. In team sports, this activity would target the compensatory athletic skills required during phase transitions where athletes couple their movements at various speeds relative to the movements of opponents, teammates and direction of the ball [8, 22]. The transfer of specific athletic skills using the affordance landscape is dependent on several factors such as the skill level, injury status and maturation of the athlete, and sport practitioners should adapt the difficulty of the activities during practice programmes accordingly.|$|R

40|$|The {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) is frequently rup-tured in European team handball, US college and high school sports (basketball, soccer, and gymnastics), and other sports and levels. 2, 3, 22, 28, 29 Female athletes are at an increased risk for ACL injuries with an injury rate 3 to 5 times higher than men. Although a number of hypotheses have been suggested to explain this gender difference, the etiology is still unknown. 15, 19, 21 Over the past 2 decades, several studies have been car-ried out to understand the anatomy, function, and mechan-ical properties of the ACL. Because of advances in surgical techniques and rehabilitation, reconstruction of the ACL has become a relatively routine procedure. However, although {{an understanding of the}} etiology of ACL injuries is essential to develop effective prevention methods, little attention has been focused on the injury mechanisms of these injuries in team sports. Injured players report that the injuries often occur in a <b>cutting</b> <b>movement</b> or landing from a jump and, apparently, without direct body con-tact. 7, 28, 29 Myklebust et al 28, 29 reported on the mechanisms of ACL injury on a total of 115 injuries (male and female) in 2 studies and found that 95 % and 89 % of the players reported that the injuries occurred without player-to-player contact. The injured players also reported that most of the injuries occurred in a move they had done numerous times before.

40|$|Background Hashemi et al. (2011) {{put forward}} a new theory of ACL injury mechanism, named the ‘hip {{extension}} knee flexion paradox’ that attempted to integrate itself with the most convincing findings in ACL research. This theory of mechanism stated that non-contact ACL injury would occur when the following four criteria are simultaneously met: 1) the tibial plateau has a posterior slope 2) the knee is near full extension upon application of a dynamic ground reaction force 3) activation of musculature about the knee is delayed and 4) hip extension and knee flexion occur concurrently. In their paper, Hashemi et al. (2011) also suggest that fatigue may {{play an important role}} in increasing the risk of non-contact ACL injury by delaying activation of musculature about the knee joint. Hip-knee coordination and the effect of fatigue on it, have however not previously been investigated. Purpose The purpose of this study was to quantify hip – knee coordination in the sagittal plane during a 45 ° <b>cutting</b> <b>movement.</b> Methods Nine female team sports players with experience at international or national level and no history of ACL injury were recruited. Written consent was obtained at the time of testing. Cutting was assessed under pre and post fatigue conditions, whilst motion capture data were collected for the lower limbs using QTM (Qualysis AB, Göteburg, Sweden). In each condition, ten successful 45 ° cuts were captured for the dominant leg. The fatiguing protocol comprised drop maximal vertical jumps and a multi-directional short sprint exercise. Hip and knee sagittal joint angles were extracted between the time of foot contact to 40 ms, the window in which ACL injury is believed to occur. A coordination pattern of 1) hip flexion – knee flexion, 2) hip extension – knee flexion, 3) hip extension – knee extension, 4) hip extension knee flexion was determined for each time point. The average time that each participant spent in each coordination pattern was calculated and the median coordination pattern was determined for each participant at each time point. Wilcoxon tests were executed in SPSS (IBM SPSS Version 22, Armonk, NY) to determine the effect of fatigue on the percentage time spent in hip extension – knee flexion and hip extension – knee extension. Results The average modal coordination pattern of the group, both pre- and post-fatigue, was to extend the hip and knee for the first 10 ms after foot contact. By 25 ms, all participants had changed coordination pattern to flex at the knee whilst continuing to extend at the hip. Both pre- and post-fatigue, a greater percentage of time (p< 0. 05) was spent in hip extension – knee flexion than in hip extension – knee extension. No change was seen in the percentage time spent in hip extension – knee flexion after fatigue. Practical Applications Most players adopted a hip extension – knee extension pattern at foot contact before switching to hip extension – knee flexion. The initial observation of hip extension – knee extension was interesting as it represents stiffness at both the hip and knee joint, which has been suggested as high risk for non-contact ACL injury (Pollard et al., 2010). The latter coordination pattern has also been hypothesised as high risk for non-contact ACL injury and was dominant both pre- and post-fatigue. The absence of change in coordination patterns after fatigue suggests this risk factor was not accentuated as a result of a short duration fatiguing protocol in an elite, healthy population...|$|E

The {{idea of a}} robot providing assistance in the medical field is very promising. Due to the myriad of unresolved issues a full therapist robot is still out of our reach. In this study we approach the problem in an application area that is sufficiently constrained to allow us {{a certain degree of}} practical success. Concretely we present a system description of a robotic scrub nurse (RSN) for microsurgery. We identify robot interfacing as a crucial problem to be solved. In that regard we examine how spoken language could be utilized, how vision could guide robot motion, and finally we examined human-robot interaction at the haptic level. For the haptic interface we have designed and evaluated a shape conforming grasp mechanism. Such an approach is uncommon in the robotic industry where per-task adapter-style exchangeable grasping mechanisms are mounted on the robot for each run. While industrial robots deal with few instruments and must lift heavy weights, our problem domain contains hundreds of instruments and prohibits any type of crushing or <b>cutting</b> <b>movements.</b> Our results provide an integration study of the various components for assistant robots. Furthermore we contribute novel insights in the design of grasp planning methods, visual tracking methods and natural language dialogue systems...|$|R
60|$|The place fascinated me. I had not {{dreamed that}} a sawmill {{could be brought}} to such a pitch of {{mechanical}} perfection, and I wondered how long the timber would last at that rate of <b>cutting.</b> The <b>movement</b> and din tired me, and I went outside upon a long platform. Here workmen caught the planks and boards as they came out, and loaded them upon trucks which were wheeled away. This platform was a world in itself. It sent arms everywhere among the piles of lumber, and once or twice I was as much lost as I had been up in the forest.|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{describe}} {{lower extremity}} injuries for badminton in New Zealand. Methods: Lower limb badminton injuries {{that resulted in}} claims accepted by the national insurance company Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) in New Zealand between 2006 and 2011 were reviewed. Results: The estimated national injury incidence for badminton injuries in New Zealand from 2006 to 2011 was 0. 66 %. There were 1909 lower limb badminton injury claims which cost NZ$ 2, 014, 337 (NZ$ value over 2006 to 2011). The age-bands frequently injured were 10 – 19 (22 %), 40 – 49 (22 %), 30 – 39 (14 %) and 50 – 59 (13 %) years. Sixty five percent of lower limb injuries were knee ligament sprains/tears. Males sustained more cruciate ligament sprains than females (75 vs. 39). Movements involving turning, changing direction, shifting weight, pivoting or twisting were responsible for 34 % of lower extremity injuries. Conclusion: The knee was most frequently injured which {{could be due to}} multi-planar loading. Turning or <b>cutting</b> <b>movements</b> typically involve motion in the frontal and transverse planes that may place the knee at greater risk of injury than movement in the sagittal plane alone. Further research on badminton specific movements is warranted to better understand the mechanisms of lower extremity injuries in the sport. Sports medicine and support personnel should take into account the susceptibility of the knee to injury when designing training and injury prevention programmes given the large number of change of direction movements during badminton...|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of the soil cutting force through vibrating tools was the object of many studies {{during the second half}} of the last century. These studies initially focused on soil movement by bulldozers and then on soil tillage in agriculture. Over the past years, the field of tree-nursery mechanization has been employing this knowledge due to the use of equipment with oscillating tools for root-balling plants. Transportation and planting must be performed with the roots contained in a hemispherical ball of the original soil. This hemispherical root-ball is obtained by using a vibrating semicircular blade that cuts the soil underneath the plant. The blade oscillator is complex because the blade must oscillate and advance in the frame to cut the root-ball. For this reason, we correlated the oscillation and <b>cutting</b> <b>movements</b> with the oscillator features through a dynamic analysis using the Hong’s formulae for Coulomb friction with a harmonic forcing torque. The resulting periodic motion has a substantial phase lag with respect to the forcing torque generated by the rotation of eccentric masses; instead, the amplitude predicted with the Coulomb friction is 15 % lower than the amplitude calculated without friction. Experiments were also conducted to verify the value of these amplitudes and to determine the correlations between the cutting torque of the blade in typical tree-nursery soil and the blade diameter. All the correlations proposed in this article, together with the performed literature survey, were useful for drafting new design guidelines for mechanical oscillators...|$|R
