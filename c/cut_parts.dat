2500|$|In 2005 the OMAC STEP-NC Working Group hosted an AP238 testing {{forum in}} Orlando to {{demonstrate}} 5-axis parts machined using AP238 CC1 machine independent toolpaths. Four CAD/CAM systems produced AP238 machining programs for milling a 5-axis test part (an NAS 979 circle/diamond/square with an inverted NAS 979 cone {{test in the}} center). Each run {{on a pair of}} CNCs configured for completely different machine geometries (AB tool tilt vs. BC table tilt). [...] In addition, Boeing <b>cut</b> <b>parts</b> on a variety of machines at their Tulsa facility and a machine at NIST in Gaithersburg.|$|E
2500|$|Laser cutting {{may be used}} to form {{intricate}} designs from PMMA sheets. PMMA vaporizes to gaseous compounds (including its monomers) upon laser cutting, so a {{very clean}} cut is made, and cutting is performed very easily. However, the pulsed lasercutting introduces high internal stresses along the cut edge, which on exposure to solvents produce undesirable [...] "stress-crazing" [...] at the cut edge and several millimetres deep. Even ammonium-based glass-cleaner and almost everything short of soap-and-water produces similar undesirable crazing, sometimes over the entire surface of the <b>cut</b> <b>parts,</b> at great distances from the stressed edge. Annealing the PMMA sheet/parts is therefore an obligatory post-processing step when intending to chemically bond lasercut parts together.|$|E

50|$|Because of {{the angles}} {{that can be}} <b>cut,</b> <b>part</b> {{programs}} may need to have additional cuts to free the part from the sheet. Attempting to slide a complex part at a severe angle from a plate can be difficult without appropriate relief cuts.|$|R

50|$|Piercing {{involves}} {{cutting of}} clean holes with a resulting scrap slug. The operation is called die cutting {{and can also}} produce flat components where the die, the shaped tool, is pressed into a sheet material employing a shearing action to cut holes.

5000|$|Bending {{is done by}} {{hammering}} (manual or powered) or via {{press brakes}} and similar tools. Modern metal fabricators use press brakes to either coin or air-bend metal sheet into form. CNC-controlled backgauges use hard stops to position <b>cut</b> <b>parts</b> in order to place bend lines in the correct position. Off-line programming software now makes programming the CNC-controlled press brakes seamless and very efficient.|$|E

5000|$|Edge {{quality for}} water jet <b>cut</b> <b>parts</b> is defined {{with the quality}} numbers Q1 through Q5. Lower numbers {{indicate}} rougher edge finish; higher numbers are smoother. For thin materials, the difference in cutting speed for Q1 could {{be as much as}} 3 times faster than the speed for Q5. For thicker materials, Q1 could be 6 times faster than Q5. For example, 4 in thick aluminium Q5 would be [...] and Q1 would be , 5.8 times faster.|$|E
50|$|Single-crystal {{aluminum}} oxide (sapphire - Al2O3) is a transparent ceramic. Sapphire's crystal structure is rhombohedral and thus its properties are anisotropic, varying with crystallographic orientation. Transparent alumina is currently {{one of the}} most mature transparent ceramics from a production and application perspective, and is available from several manufacturers. But the cost is high due to the processing temperature involved, as well as machining costs to <b>cut</b> <b>parts</b> out of single crystal boules. It also has a very high mechanical strength - but that is dependent on the surface finish.|$|E

5000|$|Disco DJ, mixer and remixer Tom Moulton {{invented the}} [...] "disco break" [...] or {{breakdown}} {{section in the}} early 1970s. Moulton had been remixing a dance record (”Dreamworld” by Don Downing) which [...] "immaculated" [...] (went to a higher key) towards the end, {{and he wanted to}} <b>cut</b> <b>parts</b> together that were in different keys. To do this, he separated two sections with non-tonal information. He edited in a section of drums, and the aesthetic effect was pleasing to dancers at the club. The placement was also useful for club DJ's, providing a rhythm-only section of the recording over which to begin mixing in the next record.|$|E
