5|$|The stomach in the <b>cephalothorax</b> {{acts as a}} pump {{that sends}} the food deeper into the {{digestive}} system. The mid gut bears many digestive ceca, compartments with no other exit, that extract nutrients from the food; most are in the abdomen, which {{is dominated by the}} digestive system, but a few are found in the <b>cephalothorax.</b>|$|E
5|$|Anatomically, spiders {{differ from}} other {{arthropods}} {{in that the}} usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, the <b>cephalothorax</b> and abdomen, and joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel. Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae. In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the <b>cephalothorax.</b> Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure.|$|E
5|$|Spiders a {{class of}} arachnids have four pairs of legs; a body of two segments—a <b>cephalothorax</b> and an abdomen. Spiders have no wings and no antennae. They have {{mouthparts}} called chelicerae which are often connected to venom glands as most spiders are venomous. They have a second pair of appendages called pedipalps attached to the <b>cephalothorax.</b> These have similar segmentation to the legs and function as taste and smell organs. At {{the end of each}} male pedipalp is a spoon-shaped cymbium that acts to support the copulatory organ.|$|E
5000|$|Both sexes {{have black}} <b>cephalothoraxes</b> and abdomens, with the urticating hair patch golden. The coxae, trochanters and femurs are also black, but the patellae, tibiae, metatarsi, and tarsi are reddish light brown.|$|R
30|$|The pre-cooked <b>cephalothoraxes</b> of 20 shrimps were {{separated}} and powderized by grinding with liquid nitrogen in a Waring blender (AY 46, Moulinex, Guangdong, China). To extract PPO, the powder from the <b>cephalothoraxes</b> with different pre-cooking times (50 g) was mixed with 150 mL of 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 1.0 M NaCl and 0.2 % Brij 35 {{according to the}} method of Simpson et al. (1987) with a slight modification. The mixture was stirred continuously at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 8, 000 ×g at 4 °C for 30 min using a refrigerated centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Avanti J-E Centrifuge, Fullerton, CA, USA). Solid ammonium sulfate was added into the supernatant to obtain 40 % saturation. The mixture was allowed to stand at 4 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at a speed of 12, 500 ×g at 4 °C for 30 min. The obtained pellet was collected and dispersed in a minimum volume of 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The pellet solution was dialyzed against 15 volumes of the same buffer at 4 °C with three changes overnight. After dialysis, insoluble materials in the dialysate were removed by centrifugation at 3, 000 ×g at 4 °C for 30 min, and the supernatant was used as ‘crude PPO extract’.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, {{a better}} {{understanding}} of biochemical properties and kinetics of PPO is needed to control and inhibit its action. PPO from the <b>cephalothoraxes</b> of various crustaceans such as pink shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris; Penaeus duorarum) (Zamorano et al. [2009]; Simpson et al. [1988]; Chen et al. [1997]), white shrimp (Penaeus striferus) (Simpson et al. [1988]; Chen et al. [1997]), prawn (Penaeus japonicus) (Benjakul et al. [2005]; Montero et al. [2001 b]) and lobster (Nephrops norvegicus; Homarus Americanus) (Yan et al. [1990]; Opoku-Gyamfua and Simpson [1993]) have been purified and characterised. PPO from different crustaceans showed different molecular weight, optimum pH, thermal stability and kinetic parameters.|$|R
5|$|The <b>cephalothorax</b> of Z.sexpunctatus is {{bronze to}} black in color. Like all Zygoballus spiders, the <b>cephalothorax</b> is box-like in shape, being widest at the {{posterior}} lateral eyes. Numerous white or pale blue scales cover the clypeus ("face") and chelicerae. This covering extends around {{the sides of}} the carapace, ending beyond the posterior median eyes. In males, the labium is two-fifths as long as the maxillae, and as wide as it is long. The chelicerae of males are greatly enlarged and obliquely oriented, with each chelicera having a prominent inner tooth and a long, curved fang.|$|E
5|$|Spiders are chelicerates, which {{differ from}} other {{arthropods}} {{in that the}} usual body segments are fused into only two tagmata, the <b>cephalothorax</b> and abdomen. Jumping spiders have a distinctive rectangular carapace. All spiders' abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of silk glands within their abdomen. The <b>cephalothorax</b> and abdomen are joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel, which allows the abdomen to move while spinning silk. While most jumping spiders do not build webs to catch prey, they use silk for other purposes, including moulting and laying eggs.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{arthropod}} {{central nervous}} system consists {{of a pair of}} nerve cords running below the gut, with paired ganglia as local control centers in all segments; a brain formed by fusion of the ganglia for the head segments ahead of and behind the mouth, so that the esophagus is encircled by this conglomeration of ganglia. Except for the primitive Mesothelae, of which the Liphistiidae are the sole surviving family, spiders have the much more centralized nervous system that is typical of arachnids: all the ganglia of all segments behind the esophagus are fused, so that the <b>cephalothorax</b> is largely filled with nervous tissue and there are no ganglia in the abdomen; in the Mesothelae, the ganglia of the abdomen and the rear part of the <b>cephalothorax</b> remain unfused.|$|E
30|$|Pacific white shrimp (L. vannamei) {{with a size}} of 55 to 60 shrimps/kg were {{purchased}} from a supplier in Songkhla, Thailand. The shrimp, freshly caught and completely free of additives, were kept in ice with a shrimp/ice ratio of 1 : 2 (w/w) and transported to the Department of Food Technology, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai within 1 h. Upon arrival, the shrimp were washed in cold water and stored in ice until used (not more than 3 h). The <b>cephalothoraxes</b> of the shrimp were separated, pooled and powdered by grinding with liquid nitrogen in a Waring blender (AY 46, Moulinex, Foshan, Guangdong, China). The powder obtained was kept in a polyethylene bag and stored at − 20 °C for not more than 2 weeks.|$|R
5000|$|The cyathaspidids of Cyathaspidida were tadpole-like {{animals with}} drum-shaped, cigar-shaped or {{wedge-shaped}} <b>cephalothoraxes,</b> and were anatomically similar to several other heterostracan groups. However, with some groups, {{such as the}} traquairaspids, cardiopeltids, and corvaspidids, this similarity appears to be superficial. With other groups, namely the tolypelepidids, the similarity suggests a close relationship. The type genus of the tolypelepidids, Tolypelepis, in particular, {{was determined to be}} the sister-taxon of Cyathaspidida. [...] Originally, the cyathaspidid genera were organized together within the family Cyathaspididae. Later, the genera were then organized into subfamilies, and these subfamilies would eventually be promoted to full familial status, including Irregularaspididae, Anglaspididae, Poraspididae, Ctenaspididae, etc. In 2013, Lundgren and Blom reassessed several specimens of cyathaspidids, and reorganized them into three families, Cyathaspidae, Ariaspidae and Ctenaspidae.|$|R
50|$|The Australian garden {{orb weaver}} spider (Eriophora transmarina) {{is a very}} common species of spider with many {{variants}} in size, shape, and colour across the coastal regions of the eastern states of Australia. They have very large abdomens when well-fed and exhibit a tremendous colour-range from off-white through tan, brown to almost black. They have a roughly leaf-shaped pattern {{on the top of}} their abdomen with a complex outline that is darker than the surrounding area. There may also be several whitish spots or one or more stripes. The spiders' <b>cephalothoraxes</b> (heads) and proximal (closer to the body) leg segments are usually darker, mostly reddish or reddish brown. They are able to change their colour with each moult to better match the background upon which they rest during the day.|$|R
5|$|Females of the {{jumping spider}} Portia fimbriata have bodies 6.8 to 10.5millimetres long, while those of adult males are 5.2 to 6.5millimetres long. The Queensland variety is {{typically}} {{smaller than the}} Northern Territory variety. The <b>cephalothorax</b> is about 4millimetres long and 3millimetres wide, and the abdomen about 4millimetres long and 2.2millimetres wide. The front of the <b>cephalothorax</b> is large and angular, and the face is broad, high and flat. In Australia and Taiwan, both sexes have a generally dark brown carapace, reddish brown chelicerae ("jaws"), a brown underside, and dark brown palps with white hairs. Both sexes also have fine, faint markings and soft fringes of hair. However, the female has a white fringe just above the chelicerae, while the back half of the male's <b>cephalothorax</b> has a white band round the bottom edge and a white groove down the back. While male spiders' palps are larger than females', the palps of P.fimbriata females have a fringe of hair that makes them look about as larger as males'. The abdomens of both sexes are dark brown, with white spots on the upper side. Wanless' female from New Guinea has an orange carapace and chelicerae with sooty markings, palps mainly light yellow, legs orange-brown legs, and abdomen light yellow. Wanless also found a male from the Amboina area in Indonesia, showing an orange-brown carapace and chelicerae, yellow-brown to orange-brown palps, orange-brown legs and a light yellowish abdomen.|$|E
5|$|The Chelicerata are {{arthropods}} as they have: segmented {{bodies with}} jointed limbs, all {{covered in a}} cuticle made of chitin and proteins; heads that are composed of several segments that fuse during {{the development of the}} embryo; a much reduced coelom; a hemocoel through which the blood circulates, driven by a tube-like heart. Chelicerates' bodies consist of two tagmata, sets of segments that serve similar functions: the foremost one, called the prosoma or <b>cephalothorax,</b> and the rear tagma is called the opisthosoma or abdomen. However, in the Acari (mites and ticks) there is no visible division between these sections.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of a}} {{crustacean}} {{is composed}} of segments, which are grouped into three regions: the cephalon or head, the thorax, and the pleon or abdomen. The head and thorax may be {{fused together to form}} a <b>cephalothorax,</b> which may be covered by a single large carapace. The crustacean body is protected by the hard exoskeleton, which must be moulted for the animal to grow. The shell around each somite can be divided into a dorsal tergum, ventral sternum and a lateral pleuron. Various parts of the exoskeleton may be fused together.|$|E
30|$|Protease {{activity}} of pre-cooked Pacific white shrimp {{is depicted in}} Figure[*] 1 b. As the pre-cooking time increased, the continuous decreases in the proteolytic {{activity of}} shrimp <b>cephalothoraxes</b> were observed (p[*]<[*] 0.05). When pre-cooking time reached 30 s, the relative proteolytic activity was sharply decreased from 9.65 % to 1.86 %. The remaining proteases {{might be able to}} activate proPPO to PPO to some degree, thereby inducing melanosis in pre-cooked shrimp during storage (Manheem et al. 2012). It has been suggested that the activation of proPPO is regulated by serine proteases in the hemolymph (Zamorano et al. 2009). Serine and cysteine proteases were reported to be the major proteases in the Pacific white shrimp (Thepnuan 2007). The accessibility of proteolytic enzymes to proPPOs is another important factor affecting melanosis of shrimp (Manheem et al. 2012). Furthermore, proteolytic enzymes leaching from the digestive tract may contribute to proPPO activation during storage (Zamorano et al. 2009). In addition, Yan and Taylor (1991) reported that the activity of PPO from Norway lobster heads including the viscera increased after being activated by endogenous proteases.|$|R
30|$|The {{extraction}} of PPO from the powdered <b>cephalothoraxes</b> of Pacific white shrimp {{was carried out}} according to the method of Nirmal and Benjakul ([2009 b]) with a slight modification. The powder (25 g) was mixed with 75 mL of the extracting buffer (0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 1.0 M NaCl and 0.2 % Brij- 35). PMSF at 1 mg/mL was also added to the extracting buffer to prevent proteolysis by indigenous proteases. The mixture was stirred continuously at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 8, 000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min using a refrigerated centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Avanti J-E Centrifuge, Fullerton, CA, USA). Solid ammonium sulphate was added into the supernatant to obtain 40 % saturation and allowed to stand at 4 °C for 30 min. The precipitates formed were collected by centrifugation at 12, 000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellets were dissolved in a minimum volume of extracting buffer and dialysed with 50 volumes of cold extracting buffer with three changes overnight. The insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 3, 000 × at 4 °C for 30 min.|$|R
40|$|The {{crab spider}} Xysticus sabulosus (HAHN, 1832) is a sit-and-wait predator, typical for sandy {{habitats}} in Europe and Flanders. In the Flemish coastal dunes, {{the species is}} very abundant in grey and blond dunes. lts abdominal and cephalothorical colour varies from almost completely white to dark brown. During autumn 2001, we investigated crypsis as a function ofthe occupied micro- and macrohabitat. Our results indicate that (1) Colouration differs between the populations. The species is darker in a grey dune completely covered with dried (brown) mosses and in a humid dune slack covered with algae, than in populations from a sea inlet and from a blond dune. The colouration of a population from a grey dune with mosses, lichens and bare sand is intermediate. (2) Individual cephalothoracal colouration is, in contrast to abdominal colouration, related to microhabitat selection: individuals with darker <b>cephalothoraxes</b> occupy hunting sites with a higher coverage of mosses, while those with a pale one are found in microhabitats with a high amount of nude sand. The observed spider colour-environment covariation between populations is probably the result of natural selection or colour alteration during the juvenile development. Further research on these possible underlying mechanisms remains, however, necessary...|$|R
5|$|The prosoma {{is formed}} in the embryo by fusion of the acron, which carries the eyes, with {{segments}} two to seven, which all have paired appendages, while segment one is lost during the embryo's development. Segment two has a pair of chelicerae, small appendages that often form pincers, segment three has a pair of pedipalps that in most sub-groups perform sensory functions, while the remaining four <b>cephalothorax</b> segments have pairs of legs. In primitive forms the acron has a pair of compound eyes on the sides and four pigment-cup ocelli ("little eyes") in the middle. The mouth is between segments two and three.|$|E
5|$|Zygoballus sexpunctatus is {{a species}} of jumping spider which occurs in the southeastern United States {{where it can be}} found in a variety of grassy habitats. Adult spiders measure between 3 and 4.5mm in length. The <b>cephalothorax</b> and abdomen are bronze to black in color, with reddish brown or {{yellowish}} legs. The male has distinctive enlarged chelicerae (the mouthparts used for grasping prey) and front femora (the third, and typically largest, leg segments). Like many jumping spiders, Z. sexpunctatus males exhibit ritualized courtship and agonistic behavior.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the eight}} legs of a spider {{consists}} of seven distinct parts. The part closest to and attaching the leg to the <b>cephalothorax</b> is the coxa; the next segment is the short trochanter that works as a hinge for the following long segment, the femur; next is the spider's knee, the patella, which acts as the hinge for the tibia; the metatarsus is next, and it connects the tibia to the tarsus (which may {{be thought of as}} a foot of sorts); the tarsus ends in a claw made up of either two or three points, depending on the family to which the spider belongs. Although all arthropods use muscles attached to the inside of the exoskeleton to flex their limbs, spiders and a few other groups still use hydraulic pressure to extend them, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. The only extensor muscles in spider legs are located in the three hip joints (bordering the coxa and the trochanter). As a result, a spider with a punctured <b>cephalothorax</b> cannot extend its legs, and the legs of dead spiders curl up. Spiders can generate pressures up to eight times their resting level to extend their legs, and jumping spiders can jump up to 50 times their own length by suddenly increasing the blood pressure in the third or fourth pair of legs. Although larger spiders use hydraulics to straighten their legs, unlike smaller jumping spiders they depend on their flexor muscles to generate the propulsive force for their jumps.|$|E
30|$|DEAE-Sephacel {{fraction}} containing PPO {{from the}} <b>cephalothoraxes</b> of Pacific white shrimp {{was subjected to}} activity staining as per the method of Nirmal and Benjakul ([2009 a]). The fraction was mixed with the sample buffer containing SDS {{at a ratio of}} 1 : 1 (v/v). The sample (3 -μg protein) was loaded onto the polyacrylamide gel made of 7.5 % separating gel and 4 % stacking gel and subjected to electrophoresis at a constant current of 15 mA/gel using a Mini Protein II unit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Richmond, CA, USA). After separation, one of the two identical gels was immersed in a 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 15 mM L-DOPA for 25 min at 25 °C. The activity zone appeared as a brown band. Another gel was stained with 0.125 % Coomassie Brilliant Blue R- 250 and destained in 25 % methanol and 10 % acetic acid. To estimate the molecular weight of PPO, the markers including myosin from rabbit muscle (200 kDa), β-galactosidase from Escherichia coli (116 kDa), phosphorylase b from rabbit muscle (97 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), glutamic dehydrogenase from bovine liver (55 kDa), glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase from rabbit muscle (36 kDa) and carbonic anhydrase from bovine erythrocytes (29 kDa) were used.|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} smoking {{and the presence of}} aromatic herbs on the quality of freshwater prawns muscle (Macrobrachium rosenbergii), through the analysis of sensory characteristics and proximate composition. Fifty-five freshwater thermally stunned prawns, with average weight of 33. 9 ± 13. 49 g, were used. After <b>cephalothoraxes</b> and carapaces removal, the freshwater prawns were washed, weighed, identified, immersed in brine solution (20 %) and then smoked at a temperature of 50 to 90 °C. The experimental design was completely randomized with two treatments (T 1 = smoked freshwater prawns with herbs; T 2 = smoked freshwater prawns without herbs), with 25 experimental units per treatment. After smoking, samples were frozen (- 18 C) for proximate composition analysis and portions were sensorially evaluated by 40 tasters based on a simple stimulus method. The smoked freshwater prawns showed medium values of crude protein (44. 72 %), total lipids (1. 39 %) and ashes (3. 04 %) comparatively higher than the values of the in natura freshwater prawns (16. 80 %, 0. 30 % and 0. 89 %, respectively).

40|$|The pond wolf spider Pardosa pseudoannulata, an {{important}} natural predatory enemy of rice planthoppers, is found widely distributed in paddy fields. However, {{data on the}} genes involved in insecticide action, detoxification, and response are very limited for P. pseudoannulata, which inhibits the development and appropriate use of selective insecticides to control insect pests on rice. We used transcriptome construction from adult spider <b>cephalothoraxes</b> to analyze and manually identify genes enconding metabolic enzymes and target receptors related to insecticide action and detoxification, including 90 cytochrome P 450 s, 14 glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), 17 acetylcholinesterases (AChEs), 17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), and 17 gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, as well as 12 glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) unigenes. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis revealed the different subclassifications of P 450 s and GSTs, some important sequence diversities in nAChRs and GABA receptors, polymorphism in AChEs, and high similarities in GluCls. For P 450 s in P. pseudoannulata, the number of unigenes belonging to the CYP 2 clade was much higher than that in CYP 3 and CYP 4 clades. The results differed from insects in which most P 450 genes were in CYP 3 and CYP 4 clades. For GSTs, most unigenes belonged to the delta and sigma classes, and no epsilon GST class gene was found, which differed from the findings for insects and acarina. Our results will be useful for studies on insecticide action, selectivity, and detoxification in the spider and other related animals, and the sequence differences in target genes between the spider and insects will provide important information {{for the design of}} selective insecticides...|$|R
5|$|There is {{a notable}} but {{variable}} trend towards fusion of other ganglia into the brain. The brains of horseshoe crabs {{include all the}} ganglia of the prosoma plus those {{of the first two}} opisthosomal segments, while the other opisthosomal segments retain separate pairs of ganglia. In most living arachnids, except scorpions if they are true arachnids, all the ganglia, including those that would normally be in the opisthosoma, are fused into a single mass in the prosoma and there are no ganglia in the opisthosoma. However, in the Mesothelae, which are regarded as the most primitive living spiders, the ganglia of the opisthosoma and the rear part of the prosoma remain unfused, and in scorpions the ganglia of the <b>cephalothorax</b> are fused but the abdomen retains separate pairs of ganglia.|$|E
5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders are coelomates {{in which}} the coelom is reduced to small areas round the {{reproductive}} and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a hemocoel, a cavity that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows. The heart is a tube in {{the upper part of the}} body, with a few ostia that act as non-return valves allowing blood to enter the heart from the hemocoel but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front end. However, in spiders, it occupies only the upper part of the abdomen, and blood is discharged into the hemocoel by one artery that opens at the rear end of the abdomen and by branching arteries that pass through the pedicle and open into several parts of the <b>cephalothorax.</b> Hence spiders have open circulatory systems. The blood of many spiders that have book lungs contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin to make oxygen transport more efficient.|$|E
5|$|Like all arthropods, chelicerates have {{segmented}} {{bodies with}} jointed limbs, all {{covered in a}} cuticle made of chitin and proteins. The chelicerate bauplan consists of two tagmata, the prosoma and the opisthosoma, except that mites have lost a visible division between these sections. The chelicerae, which give the group its name, are the only appendages that appear before the mouth. In most sub-groups, they are modest pincers used to feed. However, spiders' chelicerae form fangs that most species use to inject venom into prey. The group has the open circulatory system typical of arthropods, in which a tube-like heart pumps blood through the hemocoel, which is the major body cavity. Marine chelicerates have gills, while the air-breathing forms generally have both book lungs and tracheae. In general, the ganglia of living chelicerates' central nervous systems fuse into large masses in the <b>cephalothorax,</b> but there are wide variations and this fusion is very limited in the Mesothelae, which are regarded as {{the oldest and most}} primitive group of spiders. Most chelicerates rely on modified bristles for touch and for information about vibrations, air currents, and chemical changes in their environment. The most active hunting spiders also have very acute eyesight.|$|E
40|$|International audienceCrustaceans {{from the}} Jurassic of Normandy (France) were {{described}} in the 19 th and {{at the beginning of}} the 20 th century (Bassompierre, 1938; Morière, 1882; Raspail, 1901) and later revised by Hée (1924) and Van Straelen (1925). In Calvados, the Vaches Noires cliffs expose interesting layers for the study of decapods from the Upper Callovian to Middle Oxfordian, which can be compared to the equivalent English Oxford Clay Formation. Before our work, only two taxa assigned to erymids, were {{described in the}} Callovian-Oxfordian of Villers-sur-Mer: Eryma villersi MORIÈRE, 1882 (Upper Callovian, Lamberti Zone) and E. morieri HÉE, 1924 (Lower Oxfordian, Mariae Zone); another was cited as “small crustaceans not yet described” (Callovian-Oxfordian). A first preliminary study was published by Charbonnier & Gendry (2014) to synthesize the knowledge about Jurassic crustaceans of the ‘Vaches Noires’. Here, we provide an updated synthesis of the biostratigraphy and add new informations about taxa found in the Jurassic of the ‘Vaches Noires’ with the evidence of erymids (Eryma villersi MORIÈRE, 1882 - Upper Callovian; Erymidae indet. - Lower Oxfordian), mecochirids (Mecochirus socialis (VON MEYER, 1841) - Upper Callovian to Lower Oxfordian), glypheids (Glyphea regleyana (DESMAREST, 1822); Glypheopsis sp. – Upper Callovian) and pagurids (Goniochirus cristatus CARTER, 1886 – Upper Callovian; indeterminate propods – Middle Oxfordian). Eryma villersiPhotograph: Jean-Philippe PezyPage 36 This locality appears to be the richest decapods deposit of Normandy. Of particular interest is pyritised specimens of M. socialis preserved in small calcareous nodules. We analyzed about thousand of them found in place in several layers during our prospects in the foreshore and cliffs of Villers-sur-Mer (France) and Weymouth (England). Preliminary results show that M. socialis and E. villersi occupied different environments. Erymids are found as isolated fingers or <b>cephalothoraxes</b> at the surface of condensed-levels in mudflat above storm-wave base (indurated marls); articulated chelipeds are found in quieter environment with high sedimentation rate but without mecochirids. Episodic accumulations of mecochirids in nodules at several beds (until 72 % of nodules with rests), mostly articulated, are indicating regular mass-decay. These levels globally poor in fossils are highly disturbed. Also, some episodic accumulations rich in Mesosaccella CHAVAN, 1946 (an infaunal deposit-feeder with some specimens in life position) found at the same level argue for a burrowing taking place later, when more oxygenated conditions have settled on the bottom, some centimeters above mecochirids. Unfortunately, almost all nodules are crossed by small burrows probably attributable to worms, leading to a cracked-aspect of carapaces. All of this indicate dysoxic bottom-water conditions in the Marne de Dives Formation. The presence of Glyphea regleyana and Glypheopsis sp. is documented for the first time in the Upper Callovian of France (Charbonnier & al., 2013) and fill the gap between Bathonian and Oxfordian occurrences for G. regleyana. Both are usually found in the same beds as erymids but their remains are very rare in proportions and suggest a different habitat for glypheids. Curiously, no isolated chelipeds were found, only <b>cephalothoraxes</b> and an incomplete molting, all in nodules. Finally, epibionts (serpulids) have been found on seven specimens of Mecochirus that highlight new biotic interactions. ReferencesBassompierre P. & Cardinet, J. 1938.

5|$|The body of {{the coconut}} crab is, like that of all decapods, divided into a front section (<b>cephalothorax),</b> which has 10 legs, and an abdomen. The front-most pair of legs has large chelae (claws), with the left being larger than the right. The next two pairs, as with other hermit crabs, are large, {{powerful}} walking legs with pointed tips, which allow coconut crabs to climb vertical or overhanging surfaces. The fourth pair of legs is smaller with tweezer-like chelae at the end, allowing young coconut crabs to grip {{the inside of a}} shell or coconut husk to carry for protection; adults use this pair for walking and climbing. The last pair of legs is very small and is used by females to tend their eggs, and by the males in mating. This last pair of legs is usually held inside the carapace, in the cavity containing the breathing organs. There is some difference in color between the animals found on different islands, ranging from orange-red to purplish blue; in most regions, blue is the predominant color, but in some places, including the Seychelles, most individuals are red.|$|E

25|$|In arachnids, the sternum is the ventral (lower) {{portion of}} the <b>cephalothorax.</b> It {{consists}} of a single sclerite situated between the coxa, opposite the carapace.|$|E
25|$|Brown recluse spiders {{are usually}} between , but may grow larger. While {{typically}} light to medium brown, they range in color from whitish to dark brown or blackish gray. The <b>cephalothorax</b> and abdomen {{are not necessarily}} the same color. These spiders usually have markings on the dorsal side of their <b>cephalothorax,</b> with a black line coming from it that looks like a violin with the neck of the violin pointing {{to the rear of the}} spider, resulting in the nicknames fiddleback spider, brown fiddler, or violin spider.|$|E
25|$|Like {{other members}} of the genus Cyrtophora, the upper side of the <b>cephalothorax</b> of double-tailed tent spiders are flattened. The <b>cephalothorax,</b> the sides of the abdomen, and the legs are covered with white hairs. Its leg formula is I,II,III,IV – that is, the longest legs are the first pair at the front, the second pair the next longest, the third pair shorter than the second, and the last pair the shortest. The eight eyes are more or less of equal size and {{arranged}} in two recurved rows.|$|E
25|$|Jewel spiders have a {{distinctive}} appearance {{that makes them}} relatively easy to identify. The <b>cephalothorax</b> is black in colour with a bluish metallic sheen. It is covered with small white hairs (setae). The carapace (upper part of the <b>cephalothorax)</b> is rectangular in shape. The sternum (chest) is brownish black, with a yellow central area. The chelicerae (fangs) are black with four to six small teeth. The maxillae and other mouthparts are black at the base, lightening to brown and bright yellow at the tips. The pedipalps are dark brown.|$|E
25|$|The hunting {{behaviour}} of the Salticidae is confusingly varied {{compared to}} that of most spiders in other families. Salticids hunt diurnally as a rule, which is consistent with their highly developed visual system. When it detects potential prey, a jumping spider typically begins orienting itself by swivelling its <b>cephalothorax</b> to bring the anterior median eyes to bear. It then moves its abdomen into line with its <b>cephalothorax.</b> After that, it might spend some time inspecting the object of its attention and determining whether a camouflaged or doubtful item of prey is promising, before it starts to stalk slowly forward. When close enough, the spider pauses to attach a dragline, then springs onto the prey.|$|E
25|$|Arachnids {{are further}} {{distinguished}} from insects {{by the fact}} {{they do not have}} antennae or wings. Their body is organized into two tagmata, called the prosoma, or <b>cephalothorax,</b> and the opisthosoma, or abdomen. The <b>cephalothorax</b> is derived from the fusion of the cephalon (head) and the thorax, and is usually covered by a single, unsegmented carapace. The abdomen is segmented in the more primitive forms, but varying degrees of fusion between the segments occur in many groups. It is typically divided into a preabdomen and postabdomen, although this is only clearly visible in scorpions, and in some orders, such as the Acari, the abdominal sections are completely fused. A telson is present in scorpions, where it has been modified to a stinger, and in the Schizomida, whip scorpions and Palpigradi.|$|E
