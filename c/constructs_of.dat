5|$|Lesbianism, or the {{suggestion}} of it, began early in filmmaking. The same <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> how lesbians were portrayed—or for what reasons—as what had appeared in literature were placed on women in the films. Women challenging their feminine roles was a device more easily accepted than men challenging masculine ones. Actresses appeared as men in male roles because of plot devices as early as 1914 in A Florida Enchantment featuring Edith Storey. In Morocco (1930) Marlene Dietrich kisses another woman on the lips, and Katharine Hepburn plays a man in Christopher Strong in 1933 and again in Sylvia Scarlett (1936). Hollywood films followed the same trend set by audiences who flocked to Harlem to see edgy shows that suggested bisexuality.|$|E

Euro-American culture generally assumes heterosexuality, unless otherwise specified. Cultural norms, values, traditions and laws facilitate heterosexuality, including <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> marriage and family. Efforts are being made to change these attitudes, and legislation is being passed to promote equality.|$|E

The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) assesses {{the level of}} 18 symptom <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> psychosis such as hostility, suspicion, hallucination, and grandiosity. It {{is based on the}} clinician's interview with the patient and observations of the patient's behavior over the previous 2–3 days. The patient's family can also answer questions on the behavior report. During the initial assessment and the follow-up, both positive and negative symptoms of psychosis can be assessed using the 30 item Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS).|$|E
25|$|Miyagawa’s {{works are}} known for their themes of {{exploring}} memory and finding identity. She said once in an interview, “I believe everything we know about ourselves is entirely based on memory—history, science, art, religion are all <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> human memory.” Her plays are often written in fluid time and space, rather than in a traditional linear timeline. Many of her works draw from Japanese literature and art forms for inspiration and also employ characters that are ghosts. Her works have explored a variety of issues, such as the interactions between Eastern and Western cultures, feminism, drug addiction, and the death penalty.|$|E
25|$|Social-cognitive {{models of}} {{behavior}} change include the <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> motivation and volition. Motivation {{is seen as}} a process that leads to the forming of behavioral intentions. Volition {{is seen as a}} process that leads from intention to actual behavior. In other words, motivation and volition refer to goal setting and goal pursuit, respectively. Both processes require self-regulatory efforts. Several self-regulatory constructs are needed to operate in orchestration to attain goals. An example of such a motivational and volitional construct is perceived self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is supposed to facilitate the forming of behavioral intentions, the development of action plans, and the initiation of action. It can support the translation of intentions into action.|$|E

25|$|The {{rules for}} the {{organization}} are many, and conforming to them can be difficult for dancers who prefer individual accolades over {{being part of a}} team. Other university students often state that the extensive list of rules takes away the identity and expression of the individual. The team defends itself by reminding others that the being part of the organization is elective, not mandatory, and that the rules are in place to insure a level playing field for everyone, and designed to bring out an individual's qualities within the <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> a team. As ambassadors of Texas State University, the state of Texas, and the USA, team members gladly adhere to the rules set forth by the organization.|$|E
25|$|Some voice teachers, however, {{organize}} registers differently. There {{are over}} a dozen different <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> vocal registers in use within the field. The confusion which exists concerning what a register is, and how many registers there are, {{is due in part}} to what takes place in the modal register when a person sings from the lowest pitches of that register to the highest pitches. The frequency of vibration of the vocal folds is determined by their length, tension, and mass. As pitch rises, the vocal folds are lengthened, tension increases, and their thickness decreases. In other words, all three of these factors are in a state of flux in the transition from the lowest to the highest tones.|$|E
25|$|Murmurs sound {{characterized}} the quieter, introverted {{side of the}} first wave of alternative rock in the United States. The sound was new at the time, though not stepping beyond the <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> traditional rock music. The guitars have a bright, ring-like chime that brought on comparisons to The Byrds, and the bass guitar has the bright punchy sound of the Rickenbacker favored by Mike Mills. Mills carries much of the melodic element of the music on the bass, contributing to the moody sound of early R.E.M. albums. Also contributing to this sound is the distant singing of Michael Stipe whose obscure lyrics, sung indistinctly, lend to the mystery and depth of the music.|$|E

25|$|Methods {{to control}} genome editing with small {{molecules}} include an allosteric Cas9, with no detectable background editing, that will activate binding and cleavage upon {{the addition of}} 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT), 4-HT responsive intein-linked Cas9s or a Cas9 that is 4-HT responsive when fused to four ERT2 domains. Intein-inducible split-Cas9 allows dimerization of Cas9 fragments and Rapamycin-inducible split-Cas9 system developed by fusing two <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> split Cas9 with FRB and FKBP fragments. Furthermore, other studies have shown to induce transcription of Cas9 with a small molecule, doxycyline. Small molecules {{can also be used}} to improve Homology Directed Repair (HDR), often by inhibiting the Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway. These systems allow conditional control of CRISPR activity for improved precision, efficiency and spatiotemporal control.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Elana Maryles Sztokman, in {{her book}} The Men's Section: Orthodox Jewish men in an Egalitarian World {{conducted}} research into the identities and tensions among men who belong to partnership minyans. She found that many Orthodox Jewish men choose to attend these settings due to dissatisfaction with {{the ways in which}} Orthodoxy socializes men into <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> masculinites. Orthodoxy, according to the research, constructs a masculinity that is rooted in obedience, unquestioning performance, emotionlessless, conformity, and elitism. Men who attend partnership minyans are often disillusioned from those constructs and seek a space where they are welcome to think and act for themselves, to be warm and inclusive, to challenge socially-accepted conventions within Orthodox synagogues, and to act out a less exclusively-cerebral and more humanely emotional-spiritual variation of Jewish masculinity. This book, incidentally, won the 2012 National Jewish Book Council Award.|$|E

500|$|Since poetry {{was highly}} stylized, it is {{difficult}} to determine when a poet speaking as a woman actually was a woman, or a man speaking as a woman. This adds to the difficulty of attribution, especially of anonymous writers. There is some debate as to whether or not the poems by the trobairitz represent genuine feminine voices, since they worked within the highly circumscribed conventions of the troubadours. Matilda Bruckner suggests that the trobairitz [...] "spoke in her own voice as channeled through the voices of many others". By manipulating the strict <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> troubadour lyric, the trobairitz were able to create their own [...] "fictions of the female voice".|$|E
500|$|According to Franklin, the {{selective}} fragments or pseudorealities that become news stories are produced {{to attract and}} hold people's attention {{by focusing on the}} unusual over the usual. She acknowledges that no one is forced to watch television or listen to radio; people can explore other channels of communication. But the pseudorealities created by the media are still there [...] "and the world is structured to believe in them." [...] She argues that images from afar have taken over much of our everyday reality like an immensely powerful occupation force.

500|$|The {{principle}} of [...] "methodological individualism", {{which holds that}} social scientists should seek to understand collectivities (such as nations, cultures, governments, churches, corporations, etc.) solely as the result and {{the context of the}} actions of individual persons, can be traced to Weber, particularly to the first chapter of Economy and Society, in which he argues that only individuals [...] "can be treated as agents in a course of subjectively understandable action". In other words, Weber argued that social phenomena can be understood scientifically {{only to the extent that}} they are captured by models of the behaviour of purposeful individuals, models that Weber called [...] "ideal types", from which actual historical events will necessarily deviate due to accidental and irrational factors. The analytical <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> an ideal type never exist in reality, but provide objective benchmarks against which real-life constructs can be measured.|$|E
