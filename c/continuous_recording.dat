25|$|Some {{cassettes}} {{were made}} to play a continuous loop of tape without stopping. Lengths available are from around 30 seconds to a standard full length. They are used in situations where a short message or musical jingle is to be played, either continuously or whenever a device is triggered, or whenever <b>continuous</b> <b>recording</b> or playing is needed. Some include a sensing foil on the tape to allow tape players to re-cue. From as early as 1969 various patents have been issued, covering such uses as uni-directional, bi-directional, and compatibility with auto-shut-off and anti-tape-eating mechanisms. One variant has a half-width loop of tape for an answering machine outgoing message, and another half-width tape on spools to record incoming messages.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis is {{relatively}} easy when all the symptoms of narcolepsy are present, but if the sleep attacks are isolated and cataplexy is mild or absent, diagnosis is more difficult. It is also possible for cataplexy to occur in isolation. Three tests that are commonly used in diagnosing narcolepsy are the polysomnogram, the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), and administration of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. These tests are usually performed by a sleep specialist. The polysomnogram involves <b>continuous</b> <b>recording</b> of sleep brain waves {{and a number of}} nerve and muscle functions during night time sleep. When tested, people with narcolepsy fall asleep rapidly, enter REM sleep early, and may often awaken during the night. The polysomnogram also helps to detect other possible sleep disorders that could cause daytime sleepiness.|$|E
500|$|The band {{embarked}} on a headlining tour in the United States in April and May 2005, {{then went on to}} tour in Europe. Starting at the end of June, they toured North America as part of the Sounds of the Underground tour, then joined Fear Factory on the Transgression Tour in the U.S. Throughout the tour, Fear Factory bassist Stroud performed with both bands at every concert. Strapping Young Lad concluded the year with a tour in the UK. While on tour, the band started writing the next album, then continued the work in January 2006, and finished the album by May. In the same month, Townsend announced his intention to [...] "take a hiatus from making records for a while" [...] after the end of touring due to exhaustion from <b>continuous</b> <b>recording</b> and producing for the past ten years.|$|E

40|$|The current mean {{sea level}} (MSL) <b>continuous</b> <b>record,</b> {{essential}} to understanding the climate evolution, is computed with the altimetric measurements of the TOPEX/Poseidon mission, succeeded by Jason- 1 and later Jason- 2. The accurate continuity of the record is ensured by the conservation of the "historical" TOPEX orbit {{as well as by}} calibration phases between the successive missions which enable a rigorous computation of their relative biases. In order to extend the current MSL record, Jason- 3 will be the natural successor of Jason- 2 : on the same orbit with a calibration phase. Shortly after Jason- 3, another altimetric climate-oriented mission, Sentinel- 3 a, will be launched on a different orbit. In this paper, simulated altimetric sea level data are used to study the sensitivity of the MSL <b>continuous</b> <b>record</b> to the change of the "historical" orbit for the new Sentinel- 3 a orbit. By estimating the impact of the absence of calibration phase on the MSL <b>continuous</b> <b>record</b> trend accuracy at the global and regional scales and the impact of the orbit change on the long-term continuity of this MSL record, this study shows that linking Sentinel- 3 a data instead of Jason- 3 to the MSL <b>continuous</b> <b>record</b> would not meet climate user requirements regarding the MSL trend accuracy...|$|R

50|$|The {{move from}} film to digital {{technology}} has greatly reduced {{the difficulty in}} use of these technologies with unpredictable behaviors, specifically via the use of <b>continuous</b> <b>recording</b> and post-triggering. With film high-speed cameras, an investigator must start the film then attempt to entice the animal to perform the behavior {{in the short time}} before the film runs out, resulting in many useless sequences where the animal behaves too late or not at all. In modern digital high-speed cameras, the camera can simply record continuously as the investigator attempts to elicit the behavior, following which a trigger button will stop the recording and allow the investigator to save a given time interval before and after the trigger (determined by frame rate, image size and memory capacity during <b>continuous</b> <b>recording).</b> Most software allows saving a subset of recorded frames, minimizing file size issues by eliminating useless frames before or after the sequence of interest. Such triggering {{can also be used to}} synchronize recording across multiple cameras.|$|E
