25|$|The Soviet {{space program}} was {{aggressive}} in broadening {{the pool of}} <b>cosmonauts.</b> The Soviet Intercosmos program included <b>cosmonauts</b> selected from Warsaw Pact member countries (Czechoslovakia, Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania) and later from allies of the USSR (Cuba, Mongolia, Vietnam) and non-aligned countries (India, Syria, Afghanistan). Most of these <b>cosmonauts</b> received full training for their missions and were treated as equals, but were generally given shorter flights than Soviet <b>cosmonauts.</b> The European Space Agency (ESA) {{took advantage of the}} program as well.|$|R
5000|$|The three spacesuits for the Voskhod 1 <b>cosmonauts</b> were omitted; {{there was}} neither the room nor the payload {{capacity}} for the Voskhod to carry them. The original Voskhod {{had been designed}} to carry two <b>cosmonauts,</b> but Soviet politicians pushed the Soviet space program into squeezing three <b>cosmonauts</b> into Voskhod 1. The only other space flight in the short Voskhod program, Voskhod 2, carried two suited <b>cosmonauts</b> [...] - [...] of necessity, {{because it was the}} flight on which Alexei Leonov made the world's first walk in space.|$|R

5|$|Soyuz TM-30 was {{the first}} spaceflight for flight {{commander}} Zalyotin, who became a <b>cosmonaut</b> in 1990 and completed his general training two years later in 1992. TM-30 was the third visit to space made by flight engineer Kaleri, who became a <b>cosmonaut</b> in 1984 and completed general training in 1986. He served as flight engineer aboard the Soyuz TM-14 and TM-24 missions to Mir in 1992 and 1996-7, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Apollo 11 was {{the second}} all-veteran multi-person crew (the first being Apollo 10) in human spaceflight history. A {{previous}} solo veteran flight had been made on Soyuz 1 in 1967 by Soviet <b>cosmonaut</b> Vladimir Komarov.|$|E
50|$|The Soviet {{space program}} was {{aggressive}} in broadening {{the pool of}} <b>cosmonauts.</b> The Soviet Intercosmos program included <b>cosmonauts</b> selected from Warsaw Pact members (from Czechoslovakia, Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania) and later from allies of the USSR (Cuba, Mongolia, Vietnam) and non-aligned countries (India, Syria, Afghanistan). Most of these <b>cosmonauts</b> received full training for their missions and were treated as equals, but especially after the Mir program began, were generally given shorter flights than Soviet <b>cosmonauts.</b> The European Space Agency (ESA) {{took advantage of the}} program as well.|$|R
25|$|All Soviet <b>cosmonauts,</b> {{starting}} from Yuri Gagarin, {{as well as}} foreign citizens {{who participated in the}} Soviet space program as <b>cosmonauts,</b> received Hero award for each flight (but no more than twice).|$|R
50|$|In September 1983, a Soyuz rocket being {{launched}} {{to carry}} <b>cosmonauts</b> to the Salyut 7 space station exploded on the pad, causing the Soyuz capsule's abort system to engage, saving the two <b>cosmonauts</b> on board.|$|R
5|$|In the source, {{the pilot}} wore {{traditional}} World War II headgear, but Lichtenstein altered the headgear {{to that of}} a <b>cosmonaut,</b> astronaut or modern air force pilot of the Cold War era.|$|E
5|$|Polyakov's {{record for}} longest {{cumulative}} time in space of 678 days over two missions stood until surpassed in 1999 by <b>cosmonaut</b> Sergei Avdeyev {{with a total}} of 747 days in space during three different missions.|$|E
5|$|The film's costumes were {{designed}} by Shane Mahan and Kate Hawley, who spent several months on the costumes of the Jaeger pilots. The Russian pilot suits are old-fashioned and echo <b>cosmonaut</b> space suits.|$|E
5000|$|Although Poljot watches are {{commonly}} associated with the Soviet Space Program, Vostok watches were also frequently worn in space by the Russian <b>cosmonauts.</b> Vostok watches were famously worn by the <b>cosmonauts</b> Georgi Grechko and Yuri Romanenko.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cosmonauts</b> Leonid Popov and Valery Ryumin spent 185 days in space, {{setting a}} new space {{endurance}} record. Ryumin had completed a previous mission only eight months before. They hosted four visiting crews, {{including the first}} Hungarian, Cuban and Vietnamese <b>cosmonauts.</b>|$|R

The [...] "probe-and-drogue" [...] docking system (left) permitted internal transfer of <b>cosmonauts</b> from the Soyuz to the station.|$|R
5|$|The {{final year}} of Phase One began with the flight of Space Shuttle Endeavour on STS-89. The mission {{delivered}} <b>Cosmonaut</b> Salizhan Sharipov to Mir and replaced David Wolf with Andy Thomas, following Wolf's 119-day Increment.|$|E
5|$|The station {{received}} 16 <b>cosmonaut</b> crews, {{including six}} long-duration crews, with the longest expedition lasting 185 days. Resident crew missions were identified with an EO prefix, whilst short-duration missions were identified with EP.|$|E
5|$|Vladimír Remek (born 26 September 1948) is a Czech {{politician}} and diplomat {{as well as}} a former <b>cosmonaut</b> and military pilot. He flew aboard Soyuz 28 from 2 to 10 March 1978, becoming the first Czechoslovak in space and the only Czech in space. As the first <b>cosmonaut</b> from a country other than the Soviet Union or the United States, and with the entry of the Czech Republic into the European Union, Remek is considered to be the first astronaut from the European Union. Remek {{was a member of the}} European Parliament between 2004 and 2013 and, since 2014, has been the Czech Ambassador to Russia.|$|E
50|$|Aimakhanov and Aidyn Aimbetov were {{selected}} as the first class of Kazakh <b>cosmonauts</b> in 2002, for the Kazakhstan National Space Agency, KazCosmos. They trained at Star City as <b>cosmonauts</b> from 2003 to 2009, until the world financial crisis indefinitely postponed the prospective Kazakhstan mission.|$|R
25|$|James Oberg, in {{his book}} Red Star in Orbit, wrote how the Soviet {{government}} airbrushed out the <b>cosmonaut's</b> image from an official 1961 photograph of the first six <b>cosmonauts</b> selected for training, while British researcher Rex Hall showed that five people had been erased from an earlier group photograph of 16 <b>cosmonauts.</b> Clumsy attempts were later made to further doctor the historic photographs, with the insertion of imaginative but nonexistent photo details {{to account for the}} absence of the original members of the group.|$|R
50|$|In Russia, <b>cosmonauts</b> {{are awarded}} Pilot-Cosmonaut of the Russian Federation upon {{completion}} of their missions, often accompanied with the award of Hero of the Russian Federation. This follows the practice established in the USSR where <b>cosmonauts</b> were usually awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union.|$|R
5|$|Polyakov was {{selected}} as a <b>cosmonaut</b> in Medical Group 3 on March 22, 1972. His first flight into space occurred on Soyuz TM-6 in 1988. After staying aboard the Mir space station and conducting research for 240 days, Polyakov returned to Earth aboard Soyuz TM-7.|$|E
5|$|Ryder has {{one full}} sibling, a younger brother, Urie(named {{in honor of}} the first Soviet <b>cosmonaut,</b> Yuri Gagarin), and two half-siblings from her mother's prior marriage: an older half-brother, Jubal Palmer, and an older half-sister, Sunyata Palmer. Ryder's family friends were her godfather, Timothy Leary, the Beat Movement poets Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and the science fiction novelist Philip K. Dick.|$|E
5|$|After {{completion}} of NSYNC's PopOdyssey Tour, Bass moved to Star City, Russia, in much publicized {{pursuit of a}} seat on a Soyuz space capsule. Bass was certified by both NASA and the Russian Space Program after several months of <b>cosmonaut</b> training, and planned to join the TMA-1 mission to the International Space Station. However, after his financial sponsors backed out, Bass was denied {{a seat on the}} mission.|$|E

5|$|Czech {{astronomer}} Antonín Mrkos {{discovered an}} asteroid in September 1978 and named it 2552 Remek after the <b>cosmonaut.</b> Remek is {{featured in a}} 2009 independent comedy film called Osadne about three residents from Osadné that seek out Remek at his office in Brussels to help tourism in their town. Sculptor Jan Bartoš created a statue of Remek and Gubarev, which is located at Háje metro station in Prague. Another statue of Remek is located in Košice, Slovakia.|$|E
5|$|Incidents {{had also}} {{occurred}} in the Soviet space program, but due to the government's policy of secrecy, these were not disclosed until well after the Apollo 1 fire. <b>Cosmonaut</b> Valentin Bondarenko died on March 23, 1961, from burns sustained in a fire while participating in a 15-day endurance experiment in a high-oxygen isolation chamber, {{less than three weeks}} before the first Vostok manned space flight; this was disclosed on January 28, 1986.|$|E
5|$|Laika is memorialised in {{the form}} of a statue and plaque at Star City, Russia, the Russian <b>Cosmonaut</b> {{training}} facility. Created in 1997, Laika is positioned behind the cosmonauts with her ears erect. The Monument to the Conquerors of Space, constructed in 1964, also includes Laika. On 11 April 2008 at the military research facility where staff had been responsible for readying Laika for the flight, officials unveiled a monument of her poised on top of a space rocket. Stamps and envelopes picturing Laika were produced, as well as branded cigarettes and matches.|$|E

50|$|Russian astronauts {{are called}} <b>cosmonauts.</b> After initial training, <b>cosmonauts</b> are {{assigned}} {{as either a}} test-cosmonaut (космонавт-испытатель, kosmonavt-ispytatel’) or a research-cosmonaut (космонавт-исследователь, kosmonavt-issledovatel’). A test-cosmonaut has a more difficult preparation than a research-cosmonaut and can be the commander or the flight engineer of a spacecraft, while a research-cosmonaut cannot.|$|R
50|$|Space travel {{presents}} significant hazards, {{mostly to}} the direct participants (astronauts or <b>cosmonauts</b> and ground support personnel), but also carry the potential of disaster {{to the public at}} large. Accidents related to space travel have killed 22 astronauts and <b>cosmonauts,</b> and a larger number of people on the ground.|$|R
