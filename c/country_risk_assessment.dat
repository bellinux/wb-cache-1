40|$|<b>Country</b> <b>risk</b> affects {{cross-border}} investments significantly. Therefore, {{this paper}} aims {{to understand the}} concept of <b>country</b> <b>risk</b> and the available <b>country</b> <b>risk</b> <b>assessments</b> (models), by comparing and evaluating them. Secondly, the effectiveness of these assessments in predicting an economic downturn will be analysed. Lastly, this paper investigates the determinants behind the <b>country</b> <b>risk</b> models, using <b>country</b> credit ratings as a proxy. The effectiveness analysis is based on the comparison of the credit ratings with the respective real GDP growth of Malaysia, Mexico, Japan and Portugal in a case study approach. Thereafter, Spearman’s rank order correlation coefficient analysis will be performed to investigate the determinants of the <b>country</b> <b>risk</b> models. Results from the case study approach show that <b>country</b> <b>risk</b> <b>assessments</b> generally could not predict an impending economic slowdown. In addition, the correlation coefficient analysis illustrates that some variables have in general weak correlations to the credit ratings. For instance, the real GDP growth has mostly weak relationships with the ratings and tends to be statistically insignificant. On the other hand, lending and deposit interest rates have relatively strong correlations to the credit ratings and are significant at 0. 01 level for some of the ratings. In addition, Mexico and Japan have the tendency to produce opposite results with the same set of indicators. Even though investors should not rely on these <b>country</b> <b>risk</b> <b>assessments</b> to forecast a major crisis, the models could act as the basis of risk management.

40|$|The {{size and}} number of {{international}} transactions, especially in the energy sector, has grown significantly in the last decade. In this context the analysis of country risk and its assessment becomes even more relevant. Firms develop risk assessment processes that intend to be rational and objective; however, {{it is necessary to}} investigate whether <b>country</b> <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> is in practice also relying on subjective measures. The purpose of this dissertation is to explore the relevance of subjectivity in <b>country</b> <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> in the energy sector. Seven in-depth interviews have been carried out with professionals working for a number of major global firms active in the energy sector in order to investigate their conceptualisation of country risk and their risk assessment procedures. The work has been further contextualised focusing on Spain, given the backdrop of political instability, economic crisis and renewed opportunities for energy investment and trading. The thematic analysis shows that, when assessing country risk specifically looking at economic factors, quantitative measures are utilised; however in the case of political factors, more subjective qualitative measures are considered. This last aspect demonstrates the subjectivity of political risk assessment, {{which is one of the}} main findings of this research. The assessment of political risk in the energy industry can be coined with the term art, intended as a subjective measure, while the assessment of economic risk can easily be summarised with the term science. It is critical to investigate how sector professionals assess risk and to what extent subjectivity impacts the risk assessment process, especially with reference to country risk. A better understanding of such aspects can help develop more accurate risk-management techniques and risk indicators for investors and traders in the energy sector in order to better quantify, manage and minimise country risk...|$|E

The last two decades of international commercial bank lending, similar to other periods in history, have witnessed a classical boom-and-bust financial cycle.

Environmental scanning is well covered in the literature. Although <b>country</b> <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> may be regarded as a specialist sub-set of environmental scanning, the sources of information in terms of independence, objectivity, accuracy, trustworthiness and absence of bias, to inform this process are not well explored in the literature. This study addresses this gap. We survey multinationals operating from Jordan and examine sources of information within a corporation-specific characteristics framework. The main findings are that multiple sources of information are used, of which internal sources are the most important, both personnel at headquarters and personnel abroad. Analysis of the survey data on the basis of corporation-specific characteristics revealed no significant correlations. There are implications for governments with regard to perceived reliability of the information they collect and make available to multinationals. There are also implications for multinationals in terms of resourcing of personnel, especially those based abroad, and a need for an awareness of the reliance often placed on such sources.   </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of financial risks {{is a problem}} of major interest for corporate entities (organizations, financial institutions, firms, etc.). The vulnerable economic and financial environments necessitate the development of operational approaches to measure and control financial risks. Most of the methodologies that have been proposed in the past employ a probabilistic notion of risk. This paper proposes an alternative approach to measure financial risks, considering their multidimensional nature. The proposed approach is based on the multicriteria decision aid (MCDA) method Multi-Group Hierarchical DIScrimination (M. H. DIS). The aim of the M. H. DIS method within the financial risk assessment context is to develop a set of additive utility functions that classify the considered alternatives (firms, investment projects, portfolios, countries, etc.) into predefined risk classes. The efficiency of the method is illustrated through a case study regarding the <b>country</b> <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> problem. Using the M. H.

Research Design & Methods: This paper, after surveying definitions and typologies of risks, proposes the analysis of the relationship between economic security and country risk in EU Baltic Sea region countries based on statistical data from 2012. The results were optimized by implementing MOORA (Multi-Objective Optimization by Ratio analysis) and MULTIMOORA (MOORA plus Full Multiplicative Form) methods.

In this paper we proxy for country risk in EM by using time-varying beta. We extend existing literature by applying a dynamic conditional correlation GARCH model. After confirming beta is time varying in twenty EM over the period January 1995 to December 2008 we investigate the GARCH (1, 1) model and find the t-distribution generates the lowest forecast errors compared to the normal error distribution and a generalised error distribution. In a comparison of previous modelling techniques the results of our modified Diebold-Mariano test statistics suggest that the Kalman Filter model outperforms the GARCH model and the Schwert and Seguin (1990) model. Using a DCC-GARCH model our evidence suggests that considering dynamic betas can improve beta out-of-sample predicting ability and therefore offers potential gains for investors. Finally, we find dynamic betas across EM are strongly associated with each nation's interest rates, US interest rates and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) {{and to a lesser extent}} the exchange rates. Our results have some similarities to those in previous studies of developed markets in the economic determinants of time-varying beta but differences exist in the results on best model to forecast time-varying beta.

Not all hazards are detected and risks are estimated insufficiently. Furthermore, risks are mostly assessed after {{the design of the}} product and/or production process.

This paper proposes an approach to semi-automatically derive risk from a virtual reality (VR) model of a machine. The focus is on the specific category of crushing hazard. These include situations where a human being might be hurt by being crushed. The VR model is based on a CAD model which mostly has been developed during the design phase of almost all technical products. The core idea is to identify moving parts of the machine and to calculate possible crushing zones by automatic distance approximations. The used algorithm relies on geometric CAD data.

40|$|This {{work has}} a single aim, {{focusing}} on developing a political risk model relevant for tourism organisations, which are operating in an increasingly complex and turbulent international environment. It pays {{particular attention to the}} language of risk (how risks are articulated and described), the culture of risk (how risks are viewed), and the risk process (how they are analysed and assessed). The work critically evaluates a variety of methods that can be utilised to scan, analyse and assess political hazards and risks. It finds that many of the existing methods of political and <b>country</b> <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> are limited and not sufficiently contextualised {{to the needs of the}} tourism industry. Whilst many models can have an attractive façade of using positivistic methods to calculate political risks, in practice these are fraught with problems. The study also highlights a more complex relationship between tourism and political instability, whereby tourism can be characterised as much by its robustness, as its sensitivity. A model is developed which primarily adapts a systems theory approach, whereby a language, culture and practical process is developed through which the analysis of various factors and indicators can take place. The approach adopted has a number of stages, which vary in the amount of data necessary for the analysis and assessment of political risks. The model begins by utilising existing travel advice databases, moving onto an analysis of the frequency of past events, then to the nature of the political system itself, finishing with an analysis and assessment of more complex input factors and indicators which relate to notions of causation. One of the more provocative features of the model is the argument that it is more than possible to make an assessment of the risks that the political environment can pose to a tourism organisation, without necessarily understanding theories of causation.

Tissue was exposed to LPS, dexamethasone, respiratory and contact allergens. Viability of PCLS was determined with WST- 1, LDH and LIVE/DEAD staining for confocal microscopy. Cytokine contents were detected with Luminex technology and ELISA. Employing LPS and dexamethasone we were able to show that the inflammatory response in PCLS resemble the in vivo situation very closely. Repeated stimulation with LPS (intra- and inter-assay variances < 20 %) showed that human PCLS might also be suitable to characterize respiratory irritation and inflammation induced by chemicals. PCLS were exposed to 20 chemicals and IC 50 were calculated. We currently investigate cytokine patterns (e. g. IL- 1, TNF, IL- 8) for the differentiation between respiratory and contact allergens. Indeed, IL- 8 production is increased after stimulation with TMA whereas DNCB failed to induce the release of IL- 8 to the same extent. It suggests that the combination of cytokine production with cytotoxic data may represent a promising in vitro model for the screening of allergens...|$|R
