40|$|The paper {{explains}} {{what is a}} <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> buildings and what is a sustainability certification of buildings. Many certification bodies are recognized in Italy, they promote procedures for evaluating sustainability in construction and for measuring energy efficiency. These procedures are often {{different from each other}} and the comparison of differences and similarities is the central topic of this paper. The first part of the paper proposes the analysis of the Italian legislation on energy performance certificates (which is in compliance with European Union guidelines) in comparison with CasaClima certification, with the LEED protocol, and with ITACA protocol. The second part of the paper examines one case study to compare the methods of assessment and to test them in a the practical point of view. The third part of the paper summaries similarities and differences between norms and certifications today applicable in Italy...|$|R

Glavni cilj diplomskega dela je predstaviti energetsko učinkovitost obravnavane stanovanjske stavbe in predlagati ustrezne ukrepe, ki izboljšajo njeno energetsko učinkovitost. Na podlagi izmer stavbe smo naredili tlorise in načrte, ki so osnova za izračun toplotnih izgub stavbe. Nato smo s pomočjo programske opreme Gradbena fizika URSA 3 izračunali toplotne izgube in potrebno energijo za ogrevanje stavbe v skladu s pravilnikom o toplotni zaščiti in učinkoviti rabi energije v stavbah. Glede na dobljene rezultate smo predlagali ukrepe in primerjali možne prihranke energije z obstoječim stanjem. <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> a {{building}} is a document with key data about consumption of energy for heating {{a building}}. The main objective of the thesis is to present energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> a residential building and to suggest appropriate measures, which improve its energy efficiency. Based on {{the dimensions of the}} building we made floor plans and plans, which are the basis for calculation of heat losses of the building. Afterwards we used Building physics URSA 3 to calculate heat losses and energy needed for heating the building in accordance with Regulations on heat protection and the effective energy use in buildings.

40|$|The {{building}} sector consumes {{the largest}} part of common final energy {{consumed in the}} European Union and therefore this sector has a huge potential for reducing the energy consumption. Part of the strategy which aims to limit the use of energy in buildings represent in 2002 adopted Directive on Energy Performance of Buildings (2002 / 91 / EC) and revised EPBD Directive 2010 / 31 / EU which is an upgrade of the first one and sets some further strengthened requirements. Additionally to the provisions targeted to these objectives, the Directive prescribes the introduction of an energy performance <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> building. The energy performance certificate is a document containing {{the information about the}} building energy performance including recommendations for increasing the energy efficiency. From January 1, 2015 the energy performance <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> building is obligatory required in Republic of Slovenia when selling the entire building or a part thereof and when renting a building for a period of one year or more. The main purpose of this thesis is to examine the impact <b>of</b> energy performance <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> buildings on the real estate prices in Republic of Slovenia in the period after its enforcement. The first part of diploma thesis presents the general information about the energy performance <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> building and includes an analysis of four studies that provide key findings in the field <b>of</b> energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> buildings and the impact <b>of</b> energy performance <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> buildings on the real estate prices in other countries. Research in other countries has shown that energy performance <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> buildings have some impact on the real estate prices. In following part the public opinion survey by using a questionnaire is presented. By means of the questionnaire we analysed the impact <b>of</b> energy performance <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> buildings on the real estate prices in Republic of Slovenia and the public attitudes towards the energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> buildings. The data obtained were analysed by using the SPSS program and some results were compared with other studies. We found that the energy performance <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> buildings (so far) have no major impact on the real estate prices as in Republic of Slovenia the energy performance <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> buildings do not have the tradition yet. However, the buyers of the buildings are slowly starting to consider the data on the energy classes of buildings...|$|R
