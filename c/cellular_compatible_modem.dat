40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{outcome for}} {{glioblastoma}} patients remains dismal for its invariably recrudesces within 2 cm of the resection cavity. Local immunotherapy {{has the potential}} to eradicate the residual infiltrative component of these tumors. Here, we report the development of a biodegradable hydrogel containing therapeutic T lymphocytes for localized delivery to glioblastoma cells for brain tumor immunotherapy. Thermoreversible poly(ethylene glycol) -g-chitosan hydrogels (PCgels) were optimized for steady T lymphocyte release. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed the chemical structure of poly(ethylene glycol) -g-chitosan, and rheological studies revealed that the sol-to-gel transition of the PCgel occurred around ≥ 32 °C. T lymphocyte invasion through the PCgel and subsequent cytotoxicity to glioblastoma were assessed in vitro. The PCgel was shown to be <b>cellular</b> <b>compatible</b> with T lymphocytes, and the T lymphocytes retain their anti-glioblastoma activity after being encapsulated in the PCgel.

In the tested design the robot weapon is a nucleic acid fully contained in the inner of the tube and linked to a single point of the internal face of the flap. Upon actuation the nanorobot moves the flap extracting the nucleic acid that assembles into a hemin/G-quadruplex horseradish peroxidase mimicking DNAzyme catalyzing a colorimetric reaction or chemiluminescence generation. The actuation switch is triggered by an external nucleic acid (target) that interacts with a complementary nucleic acid that is beard externally by the nanorobot (probe). Hybridization of probe and target produces a localized structural change that results in flap opening. The flap movement is studied on a two-dimensional prototype origami using Förster resonance energy transfer and is shown to be triggered by a variety of targets, including natural RNAs.

Large {{regions of the world}} are too sparsely populated to be economically served by terrestrial cellular communications. Since satellites are well suited to this application, TRW filed with the FCC on May 31, 1993 for the Odyssey construction permit. Odyssey will provide high quality wireless communication services worldwide from satellites. These services will include: voice, data, paging, and messaging. Odyssey will be an economical approach to providing communications. A constellation of 12 satellites will be orbited in three, 55 deg. inclined planes at an altitude of 10, 354 km to provide continuous coverage of designated regions. Two satellites will be visible anywhere in the world at all times. This dual visibility leads to high line-of-sight elevation angles, minimizing obstructions by terrain, trees and buildings. Each satellite generates a multibeam antenna pattern that divides its coverage area into a set of contiguous cells. The communications system employs spread spectrum CDMA on both the uplinks and downlinks. This signaling method permits band sharing with other systems and applications. Signal processing is accomplished on the ground at the satellite's 'Gateway' stations. The 'bent pipe' transponders accommodates different regional standards, as well as signaling changes over time.

We propose a new scheduling algorithm, which bounds the throughput ratio (Rmax R min) between the best-channel user and the worst-channel user and maximizes the total throughput. Thus, it can guarantees minimum bandwidth by adapting the through-put ratio (Rmax R min). Furthermore, if the user data in the queue is less than the accommodation size of the assigned slot, there will be a loss of efficiency. We add a function to the scheduler to protect the system from this performance degradation. ...|$|R

Applications include fiber restoration; bringing B-ISON to remote or temporary sites; SOH broadcasting. The design relies on an advanced coding/modulation scheme and state-of-the-art signal processing to achieve excellent power/bandwidth performance and robust synchronisation.

40|$|TonEBP is {{a member}} of the Rel family of {{transcriptional}} activators, distinct from other members NFκB and NFAT. In the medulla of mammalian kidney, TonEBP is a local differentiation factor that stimulates the transcription of several genes. The activity of TonEBP is regulated by changes in diuretic status mainly at the level of nucleocytoplasmic distribution. Some of the genes stimulated by TonEBP encode transporters and a synthetic enzyme for <b>cellular</b> accumulation of <b>compatible</b> osmolytes, which protect cells from the deleterious effects of hypertonicity by lowering cellular ionic strength. Other genes include the vasopressin-regulated urea transporters that play a key role in building up high urea concentrations in the renal medulla during antidiuresis and a heat shock protein 70 that protects cells from the deadly effects of urea. TonEBP is also abundantly expressed in other tissues such as brain, heart, liver, and activated T-cells.

40|$|To optimally design {{circuits}} {{for operation}} at high intensities of ionizing radiation, and to accurately predict their a behavior under radiation, precise device models are needed that include both stationary and dynamic {{effects of such}} radiation. Depending on the type and intensity of the ionizing radiation, different degradation mechanisms, such as photoelectric effect, total dose effect, or single even upset might be dominant. In this paper, the authors consider the photoelectric effect associated with the generation of electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor. The effects of low radiation intensity on p-II diodes and bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) were described by low-injection theory in the classical paper by Wirth and Rogers. However, in BJTs <b>compatible</b> with <b>modem</b> integrated circuit technology, high-resistivity regions are often used to enhance device performance, either as a substrate or as an epitaxial layer such as the low-doped n-type collector region of the device. Using low-injection theory, the transient response of epitaxial BJTs was discussed by Florian et al., who mainly concentrated {{on the effects of}} the Hi-Lo (high doping - low doping) epilayer/substrate junction of the collector, and on geometrical effects of realistic devices. For devices with highly resistive regions, the assumption of low-level injection is often inappropriate, even at moderate radiation intensities, and a more complete theory for high-injection levels was needed. In the dynamic photocurrent model by Enlow and Alexander. p-n junctions exposed to high-intensity radiation were considered. In their work, the variation of the minority carrier lifetime with excess carrier density, and the effects of the ohmic electric field in the quasi-neutral (q-n) regions were included in a simplified manner. Later, Wunsch and Axness presented a more comprehensive model for the transient radiation response of p-n and p-i-n diode geometries. A stationary model for high-level injection in p-n junctions was developed by Isaque et al. They used a more complete ambipolar transport equation, which included the dependencies of the transport parameters (ambipolar diffusion constant, mobility, and recombination rate) on the excess minority carrier concentration. The expression used for the recombination rate was that of Shockley-Reed-Hall (SRH) recombination which is dominant for low to mid-level radiation intensities. However, at higher intensities, Auger recombination becomes important eventually dominant. The complete ambipolar transport equation including the complicated dependence of transport parameters on the radiation intensity, cannot be solved analytically. This solution is obtained for each of the regimes where a given recombination mechanism dominates, and then by joining these solutions using appropriate smoothing functions. This approach allows them to develop a BJT model accounting for the photoelectric effect of the ionizing radiation that can be implemented in SPICE...|$|R
40|$|Tonicity {{responsive}} enhancer binding protein (TonEBP) is {{the transcription}} factor that regulates tonicity responsive expression of proteins that catalyze <b>cellular</b> accumulation of <b>compatible</b> osmolytes. In cultured MDCK cells, hypertonicity stimulates {{the activity of}} TonEBP via a combination of increased protein abundance and increased nuclear localization. For investigating regulation of TonEBP in the kidney, rats were subjected to water loading or dehydration. Water loading lowered urine osmolality and mRNA expression of sodium/myo-inositol cotransporter (SMIT), a target gene of TonEBP, in the renal medulla; dehydration doubled the urine osmolality and increased SMIT mRNA expression. In contrast, overall abundance of TonEBP and its mRNA measured by immunoblot and ribonuclease protection assay, respectively, was not affected. Immunohistochemical analysis, however, revealed that nuclear distribution of TonEBP is generally increased throughout the medulla in dehydrated animals compared with water loaded animals. Increased nuclear localization was particularly dramatic in thin limbs. Notable exceptions were the middle to terminal portions of the inner medullary collecting ducts and blood vessels, where a change in TonEBP distribution was not evident. Immunohistochemical detection of SMIT mRNA revealed that the changes in nuclear distribution of TonEBP correlate with expression of SMIT. It is concluded that under physiologic conditions, nucleocytoplasmic distribution is the dominant mode of regulation of TonEBP in the renal medulla. close 515...|$|R

Two independent lines of transgenic (Tg) mice that overexpress the dominant-negative form of OREBP specifically in the collecting ducts were generated to study the physiological role of OREBP in the kidney. These Tg mice exhibited polyuria, polydipsia due to impaired urine concentrating ability. There was a reduction in the mRNA expression level of AQP- 2, UTA- 1 and UTA- 2 in both renal medulla and renal epithelial cells of Tg mice but no change in the AQP- 3 expression. However, during dehydration, Tg mice were able to concentrate their urine to ~ 30 % of that in the non-Tg mice and there was up-regulation of AQP- 2 and UTA- 1 mRNA expression.

The need for a greater territorial coverage of mobile telephone service, due to the continuous request of users and to the presence of more operators in the market, led an intensification of the installations that not only made to a progressive decrease the power radiated from individual installations, it also required that they be placed closer to homes with consequent concern of the population for their own health.

Decreased Pdcd 4 protein stability due to PI 3 K-mTOR-p 70 S 6 K 1 dependent phosphorylation of Pdcd 4 followed by β-TrCP 1 -mediated ubiquitination, and proteasomal destruction of the protein was characterized as a major mechanism contributing to the loss of Pdcd 4 expression in tumors. In an attempt to identify stabilizers of Pdcd 4, we used a luciferase-based high-throughput <b>compatible</b> <b>cellular</b> assay to monitor phosphorylation-dependent proteasomal degradation of Pdcd 4 in response to mitogen stimulation. Following a screen of approximately 2000 compounds, we identified 1, 2 -bis(4 -chlorophenyl) disulfide as a novel Pdcd 4 stabilizer. To determine an initial structure-activity relationship, we used 3 additional compounds, synthesized according to previous reports, and 2 commercially available compounds for further testing, in which either the linker between the aryls was modified (compounds 2 - 4) or the chlorine residues were replaced by groups with different electronic properties (compounds 5 and 6). We observed that those compounds with alterations in the sulfide linker completely lost the Pdcd 4 stabilizing potential. In contrast, modifications in the chlorine residues showed only minor effects on the Pdcd 4 stabilizing activity. A reporter with a mutated phospho-degron verified the specificity of the compounds for stabilizing the Pdcd 4 reporter. Interestingly, the active diaryl disulfides inhibited proliferation and viability at concentrations where they stabilized Pdcd 4, suggesting that Pdcd 4 stabilization might contribute to the anti-proliferative properties. Finally, computational modelling indicated that the flexibility of the disulfide linker might be necessary to exert the biological functions of the compounds, as the inactive compound appeared to be energetically more restricted...|$|R
