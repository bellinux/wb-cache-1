40|$|The {{characterisation}} of {{the risk}} of (new) chemicals to species/communities, when both the exposure/environmental concentration and effects (species sensitivity) are variable and uncertain, is the central issue in Probabilistic Environmental Risk Assessment. The spatial variability {{is one of the largest}} components of the total variability. This paper tries to explicitly account for this spatial variability by georeferencing the exposure, effect and finally probabilistic risk. Geo-referencing makes the risk assessment more refined and realistic. In addition, it is also highlighted that geo-referencing the effects of <b>chemicals</b> (<b>species</b> sensitivity distribution) is still a large unexplored area but has large potential to improve probabilistic ecological risk assessments...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIt's {{important}} for the safety planning of the chemical industrial park to calculate the safety capacity of the park as chemical industrial parks developed fast in recent decades in our country. This paper defined the safety capacity of chemical industrial park and improved the calculation methods which had been presented. The safety capacity of chemical industrial park could be calculated by using the indictors of the safety capacity (individual risk, social risk and potential risk), in the basic information of the park, such as the production scale of enterprises in the park, layout and the population distribution and so on. The new method presented the concepts of hazardous chemicals equivalent to research {{the impact of the}} hazardous <b>chemicals</b> <b>species</b> to the safety capacity. The effect of population distribution will also be considered when calculating the safety capacity. Besides, the domino effect should be discussed to fix the safety capacity of the chemical industrial park when the park is at full load condition. Then, the real safety capacity of the park could be calculated. Finally, the analysis process of the appropriate safety capacity is illustrated with an application example in a certain chemical industrial park...|$|R
25|$|Bags {{of cement}} {{routinely}} have {{health and safety}} warnings printed on them because not only is cement highly alkaline, but the setting process is exothermic. As a result, wet cement is strongly caustic (water pH = 13.5) and can easily cause severe skin burns if not promptly washed off with water. Similarly, dry cement powder in contact with mucous membranes can cause severe eye or respiratory irritation. Some trace elements, such as chromium, from impurities naturally present in the raw materials used to produce cement may cause allergic dermatitis. Reducing agents such as ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) are often added to cement to convert the carcinogenic hexavalent chromate (CrO42âˆ’) into trivalent chromium (Cr3+), a less toxic <b>chemical</b> <b>species.</b> Cement users need also to wear appropriate gloves and protective clothing.|$|E
25|$|Sulfate {{aerosols}} promote complex {{chemical reactions}} on their surfaces that alter chlorine and nitrogen <b>chemical</b> <b>species</b> in the stratosphere. This effect, together with increased stratospheric chlorine levels from chlorofluorocarbon pollution, generates chlorine monoxide (ClO), which destroys ozone (O3). As the aerosols grow and coagulate, they settle {{down into the}} upper troposphere where they serve as nuclei for cirrus clouds and further modify the Earth's radiation balance. Most of the hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF) are dissolved in water droplets in the eruption cloud and quickly {{fall to the ground}} as acid rain. The injected ash also falls rapidly from the stratosphere; most of it is removed within several days to a few weeks. Finally, explosive volcanic eruptions release the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and thus provide a deep source of carbon for biogeochemical cycles.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{structures}} {{can also}} form by diagenesis or {{the formation of}} a soil (pedogenesis) when a sediment is exposed above the water level. An example of a diagenetic structure common in carbonate rocks is a stylolite. Stylolites are irregular planes where material was dissolved into the pore fluids in the rock. This can result in the precipitation of a certain <b>chemical</b> <b>species</b> producing colouring and staining of the rock, or the formation of concretions. Concretions are roughly concentric bodies with a different composition from the host rock. Their formation can be the result of localized precipitation due to small differences in composition or porosity of the host rock, such as around fossils, inside burrows or around plant roots. In carbonate based rocks such as limestone or chalk, chert or flint concretions are common, while terrestrial sandstones can have iron concretions. Calcite concretions in clay are called septarian concretions.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of atmospheric particulates that can act as CCN. The particles may be composed of dust or clay, soot or black carbon from grassland or forest fires, sea salt from ocean wave spray, soot from factory smokestacks or internal combustion engines, sulfate from volcanic activity, phytoplankton or the oxidation of sulfur dioxide and secondary organic matter formed by the oxidation of volatile organic compounds. The ability of these different types of particles to form cloud droplets varies according to their size and also their exact composition, as the hygroscopic properties of these different constituents are very different. Sulfate and sea salt, for instance, readily absorb water whereas soot, organic carbon and mineral particles do not. This is made even more {{complicated by the fact that}} many of the <b>chemical</b> <b>species</b> may be mixed within the particles (in particular the sulfate and organic carbon). Additionally, while some particles (such as soot and minerals) do not make very good CCN, they do act as ice nuclei in colder parts of the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Polanyi's PhD {{studies at}} Manchester University focused on {{measuring}} {{the strengths of}} chemical bonds using thermal dissociation, building on Warhurst's graduate studies using a sodium flame apparatus to determine {{the likelihood that a}} collision between a sodium atom and another molecule would lead to a chemical reaction. For the majority of his career, Polanyi's research has focused on chemical dynamics, attempting to determine the mechanics of a chemical reaction, and the properties of <b>chemical</b> <b>species</b> in the transition state. While at the National Research Council (NRC), Polanyi evaluated transition state theory for its predictive powers, coming {{to the conclusion that the}} theory was flawed, largely due to a lack of knowledge about the forces at play in the transition state. Near the end of his stay at NRC, Polanyi worked in Gerhard Herzberg's lab, using spectroscopy to examine vibrational and rotational excitation in iodine molecules. During Polanyi's time at Princeton University, he worked with Sir Hugh Taylor and his colleagues, Michael Boudart and David Garvin. He was influenced by studies conducted at Princeton looking at the vibrationally excited reaction products between atomic hydrogen and ozone.|$|E

Micro-XAS enables the characterization of the local structure of the elements within subcellular structures in terms of oxidation state, site ligation, and coordination.
