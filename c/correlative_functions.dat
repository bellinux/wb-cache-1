40|$|Cognitive {{advancement}} in collaborative learning is diverse, complex and interdisciplinary, involving research in technology, pedagogy, psychology and sociology. The state-of-the-art computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) tools mainly focus on promoting communication between learners whilst they {{are engaging in}} collaborative learning activities. In order to explore the elements that support cognitive advancement {{for the design of}} CSCL tools, we have undertaken a literature-based analysis of both technological and non-technological perspectives on CSCL, and have derived several essential design elements from the analysis. We propose a new conceptual model by combining these elements, which aims to provide encompassing support for collaborative learning activities and to address the <b>correlative</b> <b>functions</b> that the derived elements can provide for the design of CSCL tools for cognitive advancement. We also discuss implementation issues which affect the conceptual model and suggest how our collaborative learning tool can be built as a multi-agent system...|$|E

40|$|Proceedings of International {{conference on}} Agricultural and Biological Sciences (ABS 2015) held in Beijing, China on July 25 - 27, 2015 With larger {{planting}} areas {{being used in}} greenhouses, evaluating crop evapotranspiration in a greenhouse has garnered greater attention. Currently, calculating the reference crop evapotranspiration for a greenhouse crop through using the Penman-Monteith formula recommended by FAO is difficult because the wind speed in a greenhouse is approximate zero. In order to calculate reference crop evapotranspiration in a greenhouse by the Penman-Monteith modified formula, a simplified model for calculating reference crop evapotranspiration in a greenhouse was proposed based on the energy balance equation, which was the <b>correlative</b> <b>function</b> between reference crop evapotranspiration and radiation and temperature. The model's parameters were obtained through meteorological data taken {{from the inside of}} a greenhouse in 2011. Then, the model was validated by using meteorological data within the greenhouse in 2012, and the fitted value of the model agreed with the calculated value of the formulas with a determination coefficient (R 2) of 0. 9554. This model is an easy means of calculating the reference crop evapotranspiration in a greenhouse because less meteorological factors are needed. Furthermore, the model provides a theoretical basis for crop irrigation in greenhouses. Peer Revie...|$|R

In actual process, the wear of the tool could affect the material removal function, and make the process unstable, thus in fact, it is difficult to make a deterministic manufacturing. The focus of the present paper is on wearing characteristics of sub-aperture tools and the wear evenness as the main objectives. To make a further study, material removal function of the tool is firstly established through theoretically modelling, next, a <b>correlative</b> <b>function</b> with weighted factors is built, which is suitable for specifying the wearing degree of the tool. Finally, to discover the relationship between the material removal rate and the tool wearing characteristics, and to optimize the grinding process, analysis and experiments are then carried out on a K 9 glass specimen by means of three kinds of tool materials, i. e., polyurethane pad, aluminum plate and pitch based on the proposed technique and model.

40|$|Much {{attention}} has been given to the understanding and quantification of the availability of nutrients and contaminants for receptors such as soil microflora, soil dwelling organisms, and crops and vegetation. Many of the current concepts of bioavailability are based on <b>correlative</b> <b>functions</b> and on (pedo) transfer functions, that relate the chemical’s concentration in soil, via soil properties that are known to affect chemical binding, to a chosen biological effect. Despite the power of these approaches, mechanistic understanding is sought, that is based on the chemical behaviour in the soil system and that reflects the receptor’s characteristics. A major incentive for this need to develop a mechanistic approach is it’s generality and the potential for real prediction and incorporation in (decision support) models. In this paper, the soil (or rhizosphere) system is represented as a competitive system with regard to chemical sorption and bio-uptake. To arrive at working mechanistic bioavailability approaches, several major complications need to be dealt with, such as competition for the chemicals by soil and biota, soil-biota feedback functions, ecological aspects such as the functioning of the food web, spatial and temporal variability of biotic and abiotic factors. Illustrations of the potential of the mechanistic approach as well as complicating factors that need to be resolved are provided for several receptors.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{comparison of}} different methods for identifying the dynamic characteristics of objects associated with thermal energy generation or the medium cooling in the cooling systems of internal-combustion engines. Reaction identification to the reference exposure is considered, videlicet – stepwise, impulse and harmonic. The {{study shows that}} {{on a number of}} occasions for the type of objects being involved their application is unacceptable. In those instances it is expediential to apply statistical characteristics of the input and output signals, i. a. to employ the data of so-called passive experiment. In which case the task is divisible into two stages – determination of statistical characteristics of the variates at the ins and outs of the object and calculation of the dynamic characteristics based on them. The statistical characteristics of the variates at the input and output are obtained through time averaging of values of the variates dependent on the ordinate of the processes. Inasmuch as stochastic processes occurring in the objects under examination possess ergodic property, their averaged values are constant. All the data required for calculating characteristics of the linear systems appears in their <b>correlative</b> <b>functions.</b> Heat generating objects as well as the cooling systems of internal-combustion engines are the objects fed back by the regulator. Therefore, in this instance cross-correlated functions are employed for determining their dynamic characteristics. The suggested random-input analytical method for dynamic characteristics constitutes a good match with the results of active experiments reported in a variety of sources. This allows recommending the random signals estimation method of dynamic characteristics for the involved type of objects.  </p...|$|E

An innovation {{step in the}} field of Pol I-Promoter associated transscription factors made {{it for the first time}} possible to examine the structures of such interactions. The intention was to map DNA in small DNA-protein-complexes via phosphate detection by means of high-resolution electron microscopy (EM), especially the electron energy loss spectroscopy, and to optimize the image possibilities {{of molecular}} biologically important marking elements - B, N, F, Fe, J -. A novel instrument configuration with highly sensitive detection on basis of a SSCCD-camera with image analysis and the LEO 912 OMEGA with integrated energy dispersive filter should have been developed for this purpose. Easy handling for molecular biological applications had been an important aim of this development. The methods for P-detection having been described so far do not allow reliable results. More intensive basic analysis had therefore been necessary. The DNA imaging had not fully been reached. However, a two-window-process had been developed and applied for a patent determining the background to the phosphor element signal via a mass thickness standard.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{procedure}} for {{the determination of}} rupture complexity from a joint inversion of static and seismic data. Our fault parameterization involves multiple fault segments, variable local slip, rake angle, rise time, and rupture velocity. To separate the spatial and temporal slip history, we introduce a wavelet transform that proves effective at studying the time and frequency characteristics of the seismic waveforms. Both data and synthetic seismograms are transformed into wavelets, which are then separated into several groups based on their frequency content. For each group, we use error functions to compare the wavelet amplitude variation with time between data and synthetic seismograms. The function can be an L 1 + L 2 norm or a <b>correlative</b> <b>function</b> based on the amplitude and scale of wavelet functions. The objective function {{is defined as the}} weighted sum of these functions. Subsequently, we developed a finite-fault inversion routine in the wavelet domain. A simulated annealing algorithm is used to determine the finite-fault model that minimizes the objective function described in terms of wavelet coefficients. With this approach, we can simultaneously invert for the slip amplitude, slip direction, rise time, and rupture velocity efficiently. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic data are used to assess the ability to recover rupture slip details.

With describing non-isothermal dumbbell spring, as the function of temperature, the non-linear elastic coefficient expression causes the appearance of temperature gradient in stress constitutive equations. Following the constitutive equation of Hookean dumbbell model, non-isothermal stress constitutive equations of FENE and FENE-P models are derived. In deriving process of constitutive equations, the second moment approximation is used to closure FENE model. Using the non-isothermal constitutive equations, numerical simulations of polymer flow through shear cavity and planar contraction cavity are presented.

40|$|In {{computer}} vision, {{image compression}} mainly {{refers to the}} problem of reducing the memory size of a digital image. Mainly problems regarding data transferring over internet might require an image data to be of comparatively lesser memory size. Moreover high bandwidth is also required for transmission of high quality image data. Image compression provides solution to this problem. Now in order to retrieve the image of lesser size there is a considerable amount of loss of image data. For this problem optimized method is chosen to provide a final image which is comparatively of smaller memory size than the original image, yet it is quite visually similar to the original image. In this paper, we are trying to segment the original image using K-Means clustering method. Let us consider a grey level image of M XN size, now we know there are in total 0 - 255 grey level intensity values i. e 8 bits for each pixel therefore the total size of the image will be M XN X 8 bits. Now in our approach we have segmented the image into K clusters. Let the set of cluster centres be (c 1, c 2, [...] ., ck) i. e. we have seen that on segmentation of the image into 8 (k= 8) segments better results are obtained, hence the total image can be replaced accordingly with 8 grey level intensity values, so the 8 values can be represented by 3 bits (000, 001, …… [...] , 111). Now if we represent the image with 8 grey level values there is a high loss of data. In our approach we have tried to minimize the loss of data using <b>correlative</b> coefficient <b>function.</b> In every iteration of K-Means clustering algorithm we have compared the segmented image with the original image until the loss of data is minimized (the value of <b>correlative</b> co-efficient <b>function</b> should be maximum) and then the iteration is stopped. In this approach the compressed image is of M XN X 3 bits memory size, hence there is 62. 5 % decrease of the memory size of the compressed image, but still there is above 90 % visual similarity of the compressed image with the original image. So in our approach the main bottleneck of image compression is satisfied considerably. Advanced techniques of image processing and analysis find widespread use in medicine. In medical applications, image data are used to gather details regarding the process of patient imaging whether it is a disease process or a physiological process. Information provided by medical images has become a vital part of today’s patient care. The images generated in medical applications are complex and vary notably from application to application.

Therefore, {{there is a}} need for reliable climate proxies to increase knowledge of past and future Arctic climate change. Annual shoot length increase of the circumarctic dwarf shrub species Cassiope tetragona represents such a new climate proxy. We measured annual shoot length increase of 32 plant samples of the circumarctic dwarf shrub species C. tetragona using the presence of wintermarksepta within the stems, resulting in a 169 year growth chronology (1840 - 2008) for a High Arctic site on Svalbard. This is the longest growth chronology for dwarf shrub species produced up to now. Relationships between climate and Cassiope growth were investigated through <b>correlative,</b> response <b>function</b> and forward stepwise multiple regression analysis. July average air temperature was found to be the most important factor determining growth, by itself capable of explaining 41 % of the variance in shoot growth between 1912 and 2008.

A multiple regression model explaining growth with current July and previous year September temperature, combined with previous growth of lag 1, 2 and 5 years as predictors explains 70 % of the observed variance in growth. July temperatures and previous year September precipitation sums alone explain 59 % of the variance in standardized growth. Mean July air temperature was reconstructed for the period between 1876 and 2007 by a growth-temperature transfer model, using current and following year's growth.

Also, the activation parameters and partial molar Gibbs free energy of activation of viscous flow against compositions were investigated.

BackgroundThe goal {{of these studies}} was to explore {{the possibility of using}} gene {{expression profiles}} of circulating leukocytes as a functional fingerprint of nephritic disease activity. MethodsThis feasibility study utilized IgA nephropathy (IgAN) as a model system. Genes differentially expressed in IgAN patients were identified by Affymetrix GeneChip® microarrays, and compared with gene expression of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) glomerulonephritis, and with healthy volunteers. Of the genes identified, 15 transcriptionally up-regulated were validated in a larger cohort of patients using TaqMan® polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To test whether increased expression of these genes correlated with disease activity, cluster analyses were performed utilizing the TaqMan® PCR values. Taking a mathematical approach, we tested whether gene expression values were <b>correlative</b> with kidney <b>function,</b> as reflected by serum creatinine and creatinine clearance values. ResultsWe identified 15 genes significantly correlative with disease activity in IgAN. This gene signature of IgAN patients' leukocytes reflected kidney function. This was demonstrated in that mathematically generated theoretical values of serum creatinine and creatinine clearance correlated significantly with actual IgAN patient values of serum creatinine and creatinine clearance. There was no apparent correlation with hematuria and proteinuria. The expression levels of this same gene set in ANCA glomerulonephritis or Lupus nephritis patients were not correlative with serum creatinine or creatinine clearance values.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Left {{ventricular}} (LV) hypertrophy is a {{risk factor}} for cardiovascular death, but the genetic factors determining LV size and predisposition to hypertrophy are not well understood. We have previously linked the quantitative trait locus cardiac mass 22 (Cm 22) on chromosome 2 with cardiac hypertrophy independent of blood pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. From an original cross of spontaneously hypertensive rat with F 344 rats, we derived a normotensive polygenic model of spontaneous cardiac hypertrophy, the hypertrophic heart rat (HHR) and its control strain, the normal heart rat (NHR). METHODS AND RESULTS: To identify the genes and molecular mechanisms underlying spontaneous LV hypertrophy we sequenced the HHR genome with special focus on quantitative trait locus Cm 22. For <b>correlative</b> analyses of <b>function,</b> we measured global RNA transcripts in LV of neonatal HHR and NHR and 198 neonatal rats of an HHR × NHR F 2 crossbred population. Only one gene within locus Cm 22 was differentially expressed in the parental generation: tripartite motif-containing 55 (Trim 55), with mRNA downregulation in HHR (P <  0. 05) and reduced protein expression. Trim 55 mRNA levels were negatively correlated with LV mass in the F 2 cross (r = - 0. 16, P =  0. 025). In exon nine of Trim 55 in HHR, we found one missense mutation that functionally alters protein structure. This mutation was strongly associated with Trim 55 mRNA expression in F 2 rats (F =  10. 35, P <  0. 0001). Similarly, in humans, we found reduced Trim 55 expression in hearts of subjects with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the Trim 55 gene, located in Cm 22, is a novel candidate gene for polygenic LV hypertrophy independent of blood pressure...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{claims that}} the rhetorical design of John 2 ̆ 7 s Gospel {{encourages}} an 2 ̆ 7 ideal 2 ̆ 7 reader to construct a particular characterisation of the Jews {{in light of the}} OT citations in John 1 : 19 - 12 : 15. This claim builds upon the work of earlier scholars who noted that the OT citations in 1 : 19 - 12 : 15 were prefaced by a distinct 2 ̆ 7 formula 2 ̆ 7 ( [...] .) which indicated a <b>correlative</b> rhetorical <b>function</b> of those citations - namely, that the content of the citations witnessed to Jesus in his public ministry before the Jews. In most of the OT citations found in 1 : 19 - 12 : 15, the Jews constitute the direct narrative audience (1 : 23; 6 : 31, 45; 10 : 34), or they are otherwise present in the scene (e. g. 2 : 17; 7 : 37 - 39; 12 : 15). The OT citations in John 1 : 19 - 12 : 15 aim to bring the Jews to faith in Jesus, and also the ideal reader of the narrative. The contention of this thesis is that, ironically, the Jews do not come to faith through the citations, but rather, become increasingly obdurate towards Jesus. The ideal reader succeeds in coming to faith in Jesus through a process of 2 ̆ 7 othering 2 ̆ 7 the Jews by constructing them as negative characters {{in the context of the}} OT citations. It is argued that in the task of character construction, the reader relies upon direct and indirect means of character definition, as articulated in the narratological theory of Ewen/Rimmon-Kenan. It is shown that while direct means of character definition are relatively sparse in the pericopae under analysis, there is much indirect character presentation for the reader to construct a portrait of the Jews. This includes the response of the Jews to the content of the OT citations, indicated by their speech and actions.;However, the Jews are not only characterised by their response, but also by another aspect of what I have categorised as 2 ̆ 7 indirect presentation 2 ̆ 7, namely, the ways in which the broader, allusive contexts of the OT citations function to characterise the Jews 2 ̆ 7 intertextually 2 ̆ 7 particularly by signifying the OT 2 ̆ 7 glory 2 ̆ 7 motif. This thesis therefore utilises aspects of intertextuality theory to argue that the reader interprets the Jews in view of the Gospel 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 7 retelling 2 ̆ 7 of the biblical story. The function of the OT citations in John 1 : 19 - 12 : 15 and the presentation of the Jews within this context are primarily rhetorical and ideological, rather than being motivated only by historical contingencies or by Christological reflection...|$|R
6000|$|By what process does {{a changed}} part modify other parts? By modifying their {{functions}} {{in some way}} or degree, seems the necessary answer. It is indeed, imaginable, that where the part changed is some dermal appendage which, becoming larger, has abstracted more of the needful material from the general stock, the effect may consist simply in diminishing the amount of this material available for other dermal appendages, leading to diminution of some or all of them, and may fail to affect in appreciable ways the rest of the organism: save perhaps the blood-vessels near the enlarged appendage. But where the part is an active one--a limb, or viscus, or any organ which constantly demands blood, produces waste matter, secretes, or absorbs--then all the other active organs become implicated in the change. The functions performed by them have to constitute a moving equilibrium; and the function of one cannot, by alteration of the structure performing it, be modified in degree or kind, without modifying the functions of the rest--some appreciably and others inappreciably, according to the directness or indirectness of their relations. Of such inter-dependent changes, the normal ones are naturally inconspicuous; but those which are partially or completely abnormal, sufficiently carry home the general truth. Thus, unusual cerebral excitement affects the excretion through the kidneys in quantity or quality or both. Strong emotions of disagreeable kinds check or arrest the flow of bile. A considerable obstacle to the circulation offered by some important structure in a diseased or disordered state, throwing more strain upon the heart, causes hypertrophy of its muscular walls; and this change which is, so far as concerns the primary evil, a remedial one, often entails mischiefs in other organs. [...] "Apoplexy and palsy, in a scarcely credible number of cases, are directly dependent on hypertrophic enlargement of the heart." [...] And in other cases, asthma, dropsy, and epilepsy are caused. Now if a result of this inter-dependence as seen in the individual organism, is that a local modification of one part produces, by changing their <b>functions,</b> <b>correlative</b> modifications of other parts, then the question here to be put is--Are these correlative modifications, when of a kind falling within normal limits, inheritable or not. If they are inheritable, then the fact stated by Mr. Darwin that [...] "when one part is modified through continued selection," [...] "other parts of the organization will be unavoidably modified" [...] is perfectly intelligible: these entailed secondary modifications are transmitted pari passu with the successive modifications produced by selection. But what if they are not inheritable? Then these secondary modifications caused in the individual, not being transmitted to descendants, the descendants must commence life with organizations out of balance, and with each increment of change in the part affected by selection, their organizations must get more out of balance--must have a larger and larger amounts of re-organization to be made during their lives. Hence the constitution of the variety must become more and more unworkable.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The control of cell adhesion to synthetic polymers is {{a key factor in}} tissue engineering, resting on the ability to direct specific cell types to adhere and proliferate in order to stimulate tissue reconstruction. But often the surface properties are compromised {{for the sake of the}} bulk properties, leading to surfaces that do not support sufficiently the level of bioactivity required and accordingly the polymeric biomaterial will fail clinically. Laser treatment offers a unique means of enhancing the osteoblast cell response of the surface of a polymeric biomaterial, whilst keeping the already sufficient bulk properties intact. To this end, infra-red (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) lasers have been employed to modify the wettability characteristics of nylon 6, 6, as wetting is often the primary factor dictating the adhesion and bonding potential of materials, as a route to enhancing the surface in terms of osteoblast cell response. What is more, modifying wettability characteristics in this way is a highly attractive means of estimating the biofunctionality of a polymer. IR (CO 2) and UV (F 2 and KrF excimer) lasers were employed to carry out two different processes: laser whole area irradiative processing and laser-induced patterning. With both CO 2 and the excimer lasers changes in the wettability characteristics could be effected with subsequent enhancement of osteoblast cell response. This was also the case with both laser-induced patterning and laser whole area irradiative processing. Essentially, an approach has been established whereby the osteoblast cell response on the surfaces of laser treated nylon 6, 6 can be predicted through the laser-induced wettability characteristics modification, particularly for the laser whole area irradiative processed nylon 6, 6. This ultimately allows one to determine the osteoblast cell response of the laser surface treated nylon 6, 6 surfaces directly from the laser operating parameters. In concurrence with established wetting theory the laser whole area irradiative processing of the nylon 6, 6 surfaces caused increased surface roughness, increased surface oxygen content, increased polar component, γP, and increased total surface energy, γT; thereby generating surfaces displaying reduced contact angle, θ, making the nylon 6, 6 surfaces more hydrophilic. The laser-induced patterned samples differed from current theory insofar as the nylon 6, 6 surfaces became less hydrophilic due to an increase in θ despite an increase in surface roughness, an increase in surface oxygen content, an increase in γP and an increase in γT. This phenomena can be explained by the transition in wetting regimes from a Wenzel regime to a mixed-state wetting regime. Nevertheless, collation of the wettability characteristics results revealed that θ was a strong <b>correlative</b> decreasing <b>function</b> of both γ P and γT, indicating that surface energy played a large role in determining the wetting nature of the nylon 6, 6. It was found that for all laser whole area irradiative processed nylon 6, 6 surfaces the osteoblast cell response was an increasing correlative and therefore predictive function of θ and was a decreasing function of γP. To an extent, the surface oxygen content and surface roughness could be used indirectly to foretell the osteoblast cell response of the nylon 6, 6 surfaces. This is on account of the CO 2 and KrF excimer laser whole area irradiative processing bringing about increased surface Abstract iii toxicity, which above a certain level hindered the osteoblast cell response. For the laser-induced patterned nylon 6, 6 samples there did not appear to be any particular correlative trend between the modified surface parameters and osteoblast cell response. This can be accounted for by the transition in wetting regimes. Another important factor is that cell morphologies were modulated over all samples which suggests that varying surface parameters on account of laser surface treatment gave rise to variations in cell signaling. It was determined that θ, γP and γT all had very strong correlative relationships with the cytotoxicity. The cytotoxicity reduced upon an increase in θ until a minimum constant was achieved, whereas the cytotoxicity remained constant at low γP and γT until a point at which the cytotoxicity began to increase. These results are noteworthy as they allow one to deduce that, with constant cytotoxicity levels, the osteoblast cell response appeared to be modulated by the wettability characteristics. But once the cytotoxicity increased, the toxicity began to dominate and so negated the identified positive wettability characteristic correlations with osteoblast cell response. Practically, the surface roughness and surface oxygen content could be implemented indirectly to estimate the cytotoxicity. Increase in cytotoxicity was the result of the laser processing with higher fluences generating excessive melting. As a result of this, it is possible to deduce that there was a maximum threshold fluence, beyond which the toxicity of the nylon 6, 6 began to dominate, giving rise to a less enhanced osteoblast cell response. On account of the correlative trends which have been identified between the laser surface treatment, wettability characteristics and osteoblast cell response of nylon 6, 6 it is likely for one to have the ability to estimate the osteoblast cell response in vitro. This is significant as it indicates that laser surface modification of polymeric materials could have tremendous potential for application within the field of regenerative medicine...|$|R
