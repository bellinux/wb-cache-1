40|$|Abstract:- This work {{presents}} {{the achievement of}} a monitoring, recording, processing and interpretation concept, at laboratory scale, of the pressure inside the combustion chamber for a spark-ignition engine, based on electronic equipment, which measures the values of 17 parameters that describe the operation of an internal-combustion engine. The measured pressure depends on the <b>crankshaft’s</b> <b>position.</b> Is used a pressure transducer with strain-gauge socket, and measurement of the <b>crankshaft’s</b> <b>position</b> with a speed transducer with variable reluctance. From experimental data, on one hand, can be analyzed the pressure modification in the combustion chamber depending on the <b>crankshaft’s</b> <b>position,</b> {{and on the other}} hand, the maximum pressure modification in the cylinder depending on the speed...|$|R
5000|$|The HCS is {{distinguishable}} {{from the}} original Valencia by the [...] "mirrored" [...] arrangement of the spark plugs (they appear to [...] "point inward" [...] towards each other), the block, head and rocker cover being painted gray (the original Valencia was painted black), {{the presence of a}} <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> just above the starter motor, and the absence of a distributor drive on the rear face of the cylinder block.|$|E
50|$|It uses 2 {{ignition}} coils and no ignition distributor. Cylinders are fired in pairs (dual fire) - 1 and 4 together, and 2 and 3 together. The <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> is sensing {{the movement of}} two radially opposed position plates on the flywheel, {{one of which is}} magnetized, and the other is not. Thus, the engine management has precise information which group of cylinders to fire, and which group of injectors to spray.|$|E
50|$|As of the 2013 model year, the 4.3L {{was still}} in {{production}} although the distributor was eliminated in the late 2000s where a coil-on-plug ignition system (using a 58x <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> based on the GEN IV LSx) was phased in. This resulted in a new design timing cover with a wider bottom flange, making it incompatible with the 1996-06 LU3/L35. The only vehicles using the 4.3L by that time were the GMT900 light duty trucks and vans.|$|E
50|$|A <b>{{position}}</b> <b>sensor</b> is any {{device that}} permits position measurement. It {{can either be}} an absolute <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> or a relative one (displacement <b>sensor).</b> <b>Position</b> <b>sensors</b> can be linear, angular, or multi-axis.|$|R

In this paper, we discussed the working principle of the Hall sensor, and proposed a new method on direction recognizing technology. The dual Hall sensor structure has automatical direction recognizing and pre-positioning function, which can improve the adaptability of the sensor. Meanwhile, this new design {{can be used for}} other <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> applications...|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinder}} block was redesigned {{for use with}} a balance shaft. Cylinder heads (10238181 casting) used with the L35 will have intake ports with eyebrows that clear the fuel injectors. Timing cover flange area was thickened in 1995 {{when some of the}} balance shaft motors had a 6 bolt timing cover - some engines had a <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> (in conjunction with a redesigned distributor containing a pickup assembly which functions as a camshaft position sensor) when OBDII was phased in.|$|E
50|$|The {{functional}} objective for the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> is {{to determine}} the position and/or rotational speed (RPM) of the crank. Engine Control Units use the information transmitted by the sensor to control parameters such as ignition timing and fuel injection timing. In a diesel the sensor will control the fuel injection. The sensor output may also be related to other sensor data including the cam position to derive the current combustion cycle, this is very important for the starting of a four stroke engine.|$|E
50|$|Most engine {{systems have}} {{idle speed control}} built into the ECU. The engine RPM is {{monitored}} by the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> which plays a primary role in the engine timing functions for fuel injection, spark events, and valve timing. Idle speed is controlled by a programmable throttle stop or an idle air bypass control stepper motor. Early carburetor-based systems used a programmable throttle stop using a bidirectional DC motor. Early Throttle body injection (TBI) systems used an idle air control stepper motor. Effective idle speed control must anticipate the engine load at idle.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} realize the micromation of <b>position</b> <b>sensors,</b> and extend the {{application}} area into micro scale, this paper designs a novel micro <b>position</b> <b>sensor,</b> Mace SAW (Surface Acoustic Wave) <b>position</b> <b>sensor,</b> which can be fabricated with MEMS technology. Its key components are IDTs (Interdigital Transducers) and reflective grooves. The structure and working principles of the sensor are introduced theoretically, and the manufacture process is then put forward...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{performance}} of precision mechatronic systems is restrained by the linearity, bandwidth and resolution of <b>position</b> <b>sensors.</b> Unfortunately, these parameters {{may not be}} available {{in a form that}} allows direct comparison between sensors or the prediction of closedloop performance. This article presents concise definitions for the linearity, drift, bandwidth and resolution of <b>position</b> <b>sensors.</b> These definitions allow <b>position</b> <b>sensors</b> to be readily compared and the {{performance of}} feedback systems to be accurately predicted...|$|R
50|$|One area {{in which}} VR sensors excel, however, is in {{high-temperature}} applications. Because operating temperature {{is limited by the}} characteristics of the materials used in the device, with appropriate construction VR sensors can be made to operate at temperatures in excess of 300°C. An example of such an extreme application is sensing the turbine speed of a jet engine or engine cam shaft and <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> control in an automobile.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes, {{the sensor}} may become burnt or worn out - or just die {{of old age}} at high mileage. One likely cause of <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> failure is {{exposure}} to extreme heat. Others are vibration causing a wire to fracture or corrosion on the pins of harness connectors. Many modern crankshaft sensors are sealed units and therefore will not be damaged by water or other fluids. When it goes wrong, it stops transmitting the signal which contains the vital data for the ignition and other parts in the system.|$|E
5000|$|Data {{representing}} {{the amount of}} power output desired by the driver (sometimes known as [...] "engine load") is also used by the engine control unit in calculating the amount of fuel required. A throttle position sensor (TPS) provides this information. Other engine sensors used in EFI systems include a coolant temperature sensor, a camshaft or <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> (some systems get the position information from the distributor), and an oxygen sensor which is installed in the exhaust system {{so that it can}} be used to determine how well the fuel has been combusted, therefore allowing closed loop operation.|$|E
50|$|AMC-Renault uses a fully {{integrated}} {{electronic engine control}} system made by RenixThe Renix electronic ignition system consists of a solid-state Ignition Control Module (ICM), a distributor, a <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor,</b> and an Electronic Control Unit (ECU). The Renix ECU has a powerful microprocessor that was advanced technology for its time. It also incorporates an engine knocking sensor that allows the computer to know if detonation is occurring, thus allowing the computer to make adaptive control by individual cylinder corrections to prevent pinging. The knock detection uses the signal from a wide bank accelerometer mounted on the cylinder head. Good {{signal to noise ratio}} is obtained primarily through angular discrimination.|$|E
40|$|An {{electronic}} <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> for {{use with}} a power operated vehicle accessory, such as a power liftgate. The <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> includes an elongated resistive circuit that is mounted such that it is stationary and extends along {{the path of a}} track portion of the power operated accessory. The <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> further includes a contact nub mounted to a link member that moves within the track portion such that the contact nub is slidingly biased against the elongated circuit. As the link member moves under the force of a motor-driven output gear, the contact nub slides along the surface of the resistive circuit, thereby affecting the overall resistance of the circuit. The <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> uses the overall resistance to provide an electronic position signal to an ECU, wherein the signal is indicative of the absolute position of the power operated accessory. Accordingly, the electronic <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> is capable of providing an electronic signal that enables the ECU to track the absolute position of the power operated accessory...|$|R

5000|$|The Olds 403 {{was used}} by Buick and Pontiac in {{addition}} to Oldsmobile. The engine was only produced through 1979. Output was [...] and [...] The Toronado version of the 1977 Oldsmobile 403 engine was fitted with a crank triggered ignition system. Parts peculiar to this system include a toothed disc between the harmonic balancer and the crank pulley, the adjacent sensor (which predated the modern-day <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor,</b> which Oldsmobile used with their Quad 4 in the late 1980s with a cast-in toothed section of the crankshaft), a special distributor, an engine temperature sensor, and a rudimentary computer mounted inside the car, under the dash. No other years or models were provided with this system.|$|E
50|$|In {{a typical}} Jeep application, the {{ignition}} control module (ICM) {{is located in}} engine compartment. It consists of a solid-state ignition circuit, {{as well as an}} integrated ignition coil that can be removed and serviced separately. Electronic signals from the ECU to the ICM determine the amount of ignition timing or retard needed to meet engine power requirements. The ECU provides an input signal to the ICM. The ICM has outputs for a tach signal to the tachometer and a high voltage signal from the coil to the distributor. The <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> senses TDC (Top Dead Center) and BDC crankshaft positions, as well as engine rpm. This sensor is secured by special shouldered bolts to flywheel/drive plate housing and is not adjustable.|$|E
50|$|The AW4 is {{also used}} behind the 2.5 L (150 CID) AMC Straight-4 engine. It has a {{removable}} bell housing with a mount for the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor.</b> Early AW4s used 21-spline output shafts. In 1991 the AW4 was changed to a 23-spline output shaft, concurrent with adoption of the High Output (commonly known as H.O.) inline six-cylinder engine. Some sources state that the output shaft spline change occurred for the 1990 model year. The change most likely occurred during the 1990 model run with early 1990 models receiving 21-spline transmission and later models receiving 23-spline. If swapping transmissions in 1990 model year vehicles either swap the transfer case as well or make sure to check spline count. The input on the transfer case can also be changed to match the output shaft spline count. Rear-wheel-drive-only transmissions {{all have the same}} spline count on the output shaft, only 4x4 models are affected by differing spline count.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>positioning</b> <b>sensor</b> detects the {{characteristics}} of the magnetic fields at a given point in space. One <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> is located in the catheter tip and six more are in six patches affixed to the patient's chest and back. By having the second set of <b>position</b> <b>sensors</b> as a reference, the relative position of the catheter tip may be calculated. This offers improved accuracy within the magnetic fields along with detection of any patient movement. The relative position is important as it allows the location data to be referenced to patient anatomy.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Currently, the {{application}} of permanent magnet synchronous motor is {{in a wide range}} of electric vehicle. Field oriented control algorithm is the main way to control permanent magnet synchronous motor, the magnetic field oriented control must be precise to get the rotational position of the motor. Therefore, the performance of the motor <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> directly affects the accuracy of the magnetic field oriented control. There are three main kinds of sensors: photoelectric <b>position</b> <b>sensor,</b> magnetic <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> and magnetic sensor. Due to its superior performance, {{the application}} of magnetic <b>position</b> <b>sensors</b> is increasingly widespread.

40|$|This paper studies an {{absolute}} <b>positioning</b> <b>sensor</b> for a high-speed maglev train and its fault diagnosis method. The absolute <b>positioning</b> <b>sensor</b> {{is an important}} sensor for the high-speed maglev train to accomplish its synchronous traction. It is used to calibrate the error of the relative <b>positioning</b> <b>sensor</b> {{which is used to}} provide the magnetic phase signal. On the basis of the analysis for the principle of the absolute <b>positioning</b> <b>sensor,</b> the paper describes the design of the sending and receiving coils and realizes the hardware and the software for the sensor. In order to enhance the reliability of the sensor, a support vector machine is used to recognize the fault characters, and the signal flow method is used to locate the faulty parts. The diagnosis information not only can be sent to an upper center control computer to evaluate the reliability of the sensors, but also can realize on-line diagnosis for debugging and the quick detection when the maglev train is off-line. The absolute <b>positioning</b> <b>sensor</b> we study has been used in the actual project...|$|R

The cylinder heads were redesigned, using improved ports and combustion chambers similar to those in the Generation II LT1, resulting in significant power increases. The intake manifold bolt pattern was also changed to four bolts per cylinder head instead of the [...] "traditional" [...] five bolts. The cylinder block timing cover lip was thickened for use with the plastic timing cover (redesigned for use with a <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> with integrated dowel pins - cylinder blocks for 1996+ do not have dowel pins in the timing cover flange) held with 8 bolts and the water pump bypass hole on the RH deck and below the water pump passage undrilled. Also the fuel pump boss is still present but undrilled (which dates back to the 1992 model year).|$|E
50|$|The {{most notable}} {{change of the}} RC45 when {{released}} {{was the use of}} Programmed Fuel Injection. Fuel injection had been used on bikes previously but these had either been rather antiquated analog computers or very simple digital units with a minimal number of sensors for input, which resulted in very crude fueling. The RC30 had used 38 mm constant velocity carburettors which, for road use are quite nice, maintaining a high air velocity across a wide rpm range, though were not as well suited for racing. The RC45 did away with carburetors and in their absence a brace of four 46 mm throttles were replaced, Honda now had the throttle area it needed to make big horsepower at high revolutions. The system Honda used on the RC45 was very similar to the system used on the NR750. Contrary to popular belief the RC45’s fuel injection is not like a 4-stage carburetor, rather it is a proper fuel only system. Honda kept the ignition system separate. The Honda system obtained information from the following sensors: <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor,</b> camshaft position sensor, air temperature sensor, coolant temperature sensor, manifold absolute pressure sensor, throttle position sensor, barometric sensor and battery voltage. With all of these sensors relaying information to the ECU, Honda could have quite easily incorporated the ignition control unit. The reason that they had not came down to the supplier of parts: they had different manufacturers supplying the ecu and cdi units. Regardless, it allowed the use of very large throttle plates seamlessly over a very wide engine operating range. The engine of the RC45 also used many magnesium castings, as of rather recently, it has become quite common to see fuel injection and magnesium engine parts on motorcycles, though in the early-to-mid 1990’s this was expensive and incredibly innovative.|$|E
50|$|The Trionic system lacks a {{camshaft}} position sensor. This sensor {{is normally}} {{a prerequisite for}} a sequential pre ignition/pinging regulation and fuel injection. Saab Trionic must decide whether cylinder one or cylinder four ignites when the crank shaft position sensor indicates that cylinder one and four is at TDC. This is done by help of ionization current. One of the poles of the secondary coil of the spark coils {{is connected to the}} spark plugs in an ordinary manner. The other pole isn’t grounded directly but connected to an 80 V voltage. This means that an 80 V voltage is applied across the spark gap of the spark plugs, except when the spark is fired. When combustion has occurred the temperature in the combustion chamber is very high. The gases are formed as ions and start to conduct electric current. This results in a current flowing in the spark plug gap (without resulting in a spark). The ionisation current is measured in pairs, cylinder one and two is one pair and cylinder three and four in the other pair. If combustion occurs in cylinder one or two the ignition cassette sends battery voltage (B+) pulse to the ECU, pin 17. If the combustion takes place in cylinder three or four the B+ pulse is fed to pin 18 in ECU. If the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> indicates that cylinders one and four are at TDC and a B+ pulse enters the ECU via pin 17 simultaneously, then the ECU know that it is cylinder one that has ignited. Upon starting, the ECU doesn’t know which cylinder is in compression phase, hence ignition is initiated in both cylinders one and four and 180 crank shaft degrees later sparks in cylinder two and three are fired. As soon as the combustion signals enters the ECU via pin 17 and pin 18 the ignition and fuel injection is synchronised to the engines firing order. The combustion signals are also used to detect misfires.|$|E
