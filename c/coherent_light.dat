The intensity field is interrogated using 3-D cross-correlation techniques to yield a velocity field.|$|E

25|$|Pure monocrystalline silicon is used {{to produce}} silicon wafers used in the {{semiconductor}} industry, in electronics, and in some high-cost and high-efficiency photovoltaic applications. Pure silicon is an intrinsic semiconductor, which means that unlike metals, it conducts electron holes and electrons released from atoms by heat; silicon's electrical conductivity increases with higher temperatures. Pure silicon has too low a conductivity (i.e., too high a resistivity) {{to be used as}} a circuit element in electronics. In practice, pure silicon is doped with small concentrations of certain other elements, which greatly increase its conductivity and adjust its electrical response by controlling the number and charge (positive or negative) of activated carriers. Such control is necessary for transistors, solar cells, semiconductor detectors, and other semiconductor devices used in the computer industry and other technical applications. In silicon photonics, silicon can be used as a continuous wave Raman laser medium to produce <b>coherent</b> <b>light,</b> though it is ineffective as an everyday light source.|$|E
25|$|Fiber with a core {{diameter}} less than about {{ten times the}} wavelength of the propagating light cannot be modeled using geometric optics. Instead, it must be analyzed as an electromagnetic structure, by solution of Maxwell's equations as reduced to the electromagnetic wave equation. The electromagnetic analysis may also be required to understand behaviors such as speckle that occur when <b>coherent</b> <b>light</b> propagates in multi-mode fiber. As an optical waveguide, the fiber supports one or more confined transverse modes by which light can propagate along the fiber. Fiber supporting only one mode is called single-mode or mono-mode fiber. The behavior of larger-core multi-mode fiber can also be modeled using the wave equation, which shows that such fiber supports more than one mode of propagation (hence the name). The results of such modeling of multi-mode fiber approximately agree with the predictions of geometric optics, if the fiber core {{is large enough to}} support more than a few modes.|$|E
500|$|Typically (see Fig.1, the {{well-known}} Michelson configuration) a single incoming beam of <b>coherent</b> <b>light</b> will be {{split into two}} identical beams by a beam splitter (a partially reflecting mirror). [...] Each of these beams travels a different route, called a path, and they are recombined before arriving at a detector. The path difference, {{the difference in the}} distance traveled by each beam, creates a phase difference between them. It is this introduced phase difference that creates the interference pattern between the initially identical waves. If a single beam has been split along two paths, then the phase difference is diagnostic of anything that changes the phase along the paths. This could be a physical change in the path length itself or a change in the refractive index along the path.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWhen {{the laser}} light of high optical {{coherence}} is launched into various optical fibers, {{such as a}} single-mode fiber, a multimode fiber, and a polarization-maintaining fiber, the observed optical patterns exhibit fragmented speckles due to the field interference of higher-order modes. Hence, the <b>coherent</b> laser <b>light</b> imaging system cannot be exploited to observe high-quality fiber crosssectional images. By putting a rotating diffuser directly on the laser beam, the original <b>coherent</b> speckled <b>light</b> spots at the fiber output endfaces could be smeared out efficiently and easily. Using the low coherence transformed laser light, we can thus obtain uniform fiber cross-sectional images and clear information for the tiny index structures in the specialty optical fibers...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY We {{theoretically}} {{analyze the}} performance of <b>coherent</b> ultrashort <b>light</b> pulse code-division multiple-access (CDMA) communication systems with a nonlinear optical thresholder. The <b>coherent</b> ultrashort <b>light</b> pulse CDMA is a promising system for an optical local area network (LAN) due to its advantages of asynchronous transmission, high information security, multiple access capability, and optical processing. The nonlinear optical thresholder is based on frequency chirping induced by self-phase modulation (SPM) in optical fiber, and discriminates an ultrashort pulse from multiple access interference (MAI) with picosecond duration. The numerical {{results show that the}} thermal noise caused in a photodetector dominates the bit error rate (BER). BER decreases as the fiber length in the nonlinear thresholder and the photocurrent difference in the photodetector increase. Using the nonlinear optical thresholder allows for the response time of the photodetector to be at least 100 times the duration of the ultrashort pulses. We also show that the optimum cut-off frequency at the nonlinear thresholder to achieve the minimum BER increases with fiber length, the total number of users, and the load resistance in the photodetector. key words: <b>coherent</b> ultrashort <b>light</b> pulse code-division multiple-access (CDMA), nonlinear optical thresholder, self-phase modulation (SPM), frequency chirping, fiber-optic high-speed communications 1...|$|R

2500|$|Commonly, FCS is {{employed}} {{in the context of}} optical microscopy, in particular Confocal microscopy or two-photon excitation microscopy. In these techniques light is focused on a sample and the measured [...] fluorescence intensity fluctuations (due to diffusion, physical or chemical reactions, aggregation, etc.) are analyzed using the temporal autocorrelation. Because the measured property is essentially related to the magnitude and/or the amount of fluctuations, there is an optimum measurement regime at the level when individual species enter or exit the observation volume (or turn on and off in the volume). When too many entities are measured {{at the same time the}} overall fluctuations are small in comparison to the total signal and may not be resolvable – in the other direction, if the individual fluctuation-events are too sparse in time, one measurement may take prohibitively too long. FCS is in a way the fluorescent counterpart to dynamic light scattering, which uses <b>coherent</b> <b>light</b> scattering, instead of (incoherent) fluorescence.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Coherent</b> <b>light</b> {{emission}} from a {{gallium arsenide}} (GaAs) semiconductor diode (the first laser diode) was demonstrated in 1962 by two US groups led by Robert N. Hall at the General Electric research center and by Marshall Nathan at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center. There has been ongoing debate {{as to whether}} IBM or GE invented the first laser diode which was largely based on theoretical work by William P. Dumke at IBM Labs in Yonkers, NY. [...] The priority is given to General Electric group who have obtained and submitted their results earlier; they also went further and made a resonant cavity for their diode. [...] It was initially speculated, by MIT's Ben Lax among other leading physicists, that silicon or germanium {{could be used to}} create a lasing effect, but theoretical analyses convinced William P. Dumke that these materials would not work. Instead, he suggested Gallium Arsenide as a good candidate. The first visible wavelength GaAs laser diode was demonstrated by Nick Holonyak, Jr. later in 1962.|$|E
2500|$|A simpler {{form of the}} double-slit {{experiment}} was performed by Thomas Young in 1801 (well before quantum mechanics). He believed it demonstrated that the wave theory of light was correct, and his experiment is {{sometimes referred to as}} Young's experiment or Young's slits. The experiment belongs to a general class of [...] "double path" [...] experiments, in which a wave is split into two separate waves that later combine into a single wave. Changes in the path lengths of both waves result in a phase shift, creating an interference pattern. Another version is the Mach–Zehnder interferometer, which splits the beam with a mirror. In the basic version of this experiment, a <b>coherent</b> <b>light</b> source, such as a laser beam, illuminates a plate pierced by two parallel slits, and the light passing through the slits is observed on a screen behind the plate. The wave nature of light causes the light waves passing through the two slits to interfere, producing bright and dark bands on the screen — a result that would not be expected if light consisted of classical particles. However, the light is always found to be absorbed at the screen at discrete points, as individual particles (not waves), the interference pattern appearing via the varying density of these particle hits on the screen. Furthermore, versions of the experiment that include detectors at the slits find that each detected photon passes through one slit (as would a classical particle), and not through both slits (as would a wave). However, such experiments demonstrate that particles do not form the interference pattern if one detects which slit they pass through. These results demonstrate the principle of wave–particle duality.|$|E
