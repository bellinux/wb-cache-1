50|$|The Royal Arsenal {{was caught}} up in the Blitz on 7 September 1940. After several attacks, the fuze factory was {{destroyed}} and the filling factory and a light gun factory badly damaged. Explosive filling work ceased on the site, but the production of guns, shells, cartridge cases and bombs continued. In September 1940, prior to the raid, some 32,500 people worked there; but after the raid this dropped to 19,000. The numbers employed on site had increased by February 1943, with 23,000 employed, but by August 1945 were down to 15,000. 103 people were killed and 770 injured, during 25 raids, by bombs, V-1 flying bombs and V-2 rockets. The staff of the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Inspectorate,</b> working with explosives, were evacuated in early September 1940. Shortly afterwards one of the Frog Island buildings was destroyed by bombing and another damaged. The laboratories were partially re-occupied in 1945 and fully re-occupied by 1949.|$|E
50|$|The Royal Arsenal site {{retained}} its links to ordnance production for almost another thirty {{years as a}} number of the Ministry of Defence Procurement Executive's Quality Assurance Directorates had their headquarters offices located there. These included the Materials Quality Assurance Directorate (MQAD), which looked after materiel, including explosives and pyrotechnics; and the Quality Assurance Directorate (Ordnance) (QAD (Ord)), which looked after ordnance for the Army. MQAD was the successor of the old War Department Chemist and the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Inspectorate.</b> There was a separate Royal Navy Ordnance Inspection Department that looked after the Royal Navy's interests. QAD (Ord) was based at Royal Arsenal West together with a Ministry of Defence Publications section and part of the British Library's secure storage accommodation. MQAD was based, until closure of the site at Royal Arsenal East; and all the buildings on this site were given E numbers, such as E135. Belmarsh high-security prison was built on part of Royal Arsenal East, becoming operational in 1991.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{starts from}} an {{interest}} in the role played by national administrations in the EU integration process. Here, I will consider the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and the <b>Chemicals</b> <b>Inspectorate.</b> Since Sweden became an EU member only recently, in 1995, the agencies were entrusted with the transposition of an already existing broad range of EU environmental legislation. Considerable domestic transformation has followed both in polity and policy. The process has highlighted the differences between member state administrations, differences in terms of administrative autonomy, policy styles and procedures that tend to impact the policy outcome at national, regional and local levels. Simultaneously, the EU environmental policy process has opened up new spaces and created opportunities for these agencies to act on a new arena. The paper suggests that the civil servants have come to play an increasingly important role in the EU policymaking process and as a result these experts have gained considerable influence. The same process has restricted the Agencies' possibilities to act in the domestic arena as well as tend to centralize {{power in the hands of}} government and the ministries at what appears to be the expense of broad parliamentary and interest group involvement...|$|R

40|$|Persistent organic {{pollutants}} are either deliberately produced substances {{by the industry}} {{for a wide range}} of applications or occurred as byproducts from various activities, such as industrial or combustion processes. Despite a considerable decrease in POP levels during the last decades, unintentional production and accumulation of these substances still occur, mostly due to uncontrolled combustion processes, the lack of life cycle assessment and long-range transboundary air pollution. Remediation methods (mostly phytoremediation) are being developed in order to reduce POPs in the environment, but there are some legal obstacles of certain methods involving the application of transgenic plants, which might offer a fairly fast solution, provided that the precautionary principle is not compromised. The proper life-cycle analysis of industrial products, the combination of bio-energy crop production, constructed wetlands, reed-beds and phytoremediation resulting in complete agro-ecocycles, may constitute the basis of a sustainable, poison-free society. Sweden has the strictest and most comprehensive environmental legislation in Europe. The Swedish Government commissioned the Swedish <b>Chemicals</b> <b>Inspectorate</b> jointly with the Swedish Environment Protection Agency to prepare a national implementation plan for the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. The ecocyclemodel should provide the most suitable solution for reducing the level of POPs or eliminating these substances from the environment...|$|R
40|$|The Autumn gum moth, Mnesampela privata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) is an endemic Australian moth whose larvae {{feed upon}} species of Eucalyptus. The moths {{favorite}} host plants are E. globulus and E. nitens {{which are the}} most important species used in commercial plantations of the Australian pulpwood industry. The autumn gum moth {{has become one of the}} most significant outbreak insects of eucalyptus plantations throughout Australia. As a consequence great financial losses to the forest industry occur. Today insecticides such as pyrethroids are used for control of eucalyptus defoliators as M. privata. The carrot psyllid, Trioza apicalis (Homoptera: Psylloidea), is one of the major pests of carrot (Daucus carota) in northern Europe. The psyllid causes curling of the carrot leafs and reduction of plant growth. Today the carrot crops are protected with the pyrethroid insecticide cypermethrin, which is toxic to aquatic organisms and is, from 2010, prohibited for use in Sweden by the Swedish <b>Chemicals</b> <b>Inspectorate.</b> An alternative to insecticides is to protect the seedlings with semiochemicals, a chemical substance or mixture of them that carries a message. This thesis describes the identification and the syntheses of semiochemicals from the above mentioned insect species. From analysis of abdominal tip extracts of M. privata females from Tasmania a blend of (3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z) - 3, 6, 9 -nonadecatriene and (3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z) - 3, 6, 9 -heneicosatriene was identified as the sex pheromone of this species. The identification of the C 19 - and C 21 -trienes was confirmed by synthesis. In the analysis of carrot leaf extracts we found a compound, α-cis-bergamotene, that induces antennal response in the carrot psyllid. This is just the beginning of the studies of trying to manipulate this psyllid with semiochemicals instead of insecticides...|$|R
40|$|The large pine weevil, Hylobius abietis L., {{is a major}} {{insect pest}} on conifer {{seedlings}} in northern Europe. Due to its feeding newly planted trees get girdled, resulting in high seedling mortality (up to 80 %). As a consequence great financial losses to the forest industry occur. Today the seedlings are protected with the pyrethroid insecticide cypermethrin. This insecticide is toxic to aquatic organisms and is, from 2010, prohibited for use in Sweden by the Swedish <b>Chemicals</b> <b>Inspectorate.</b> An alternative to insecticides {{is to protect the}} seedlings with antifeedants, compounds that, either through taste or smell or both, deter the weevils from feeding. This thesis describes the search for and the synthesis of such antifeedant compounds. Bark extracts of several woody species, known to be non-palatable to the weevil, were prepared and found to display antifeedant activity against H. abietis. The major chemical constituents of the extracts were tested for antifeedant activity. Antifeedants such as eugenol, 2 -phenylethanol and benzylalcohol, but also feeding stimulants such as β-sitosterol and linoleic acid, were identified. An extract of linden bark, Tilia cordata, was shown to contain nonanoic acid, a highly active antifeedant. Other aliphatic carboxylic acids were also found to display high antifeedant activities against the weevil, both in laboratory and in field tests. The enantiomers of dihydropinidine, a piperidine alkaloid present in several conifer species, were prepared by dimethylzinc mediated allylation of 2 - methyltetrahydropyridine-N-oxide. When tested in micro feeding assays, no difference in antifeedant activity was found for the enantiomers. In a field test high antifeedant activity, comparable with that of the presently used insecticide cypermethrin, was found for (±) -dihydropindine. Other naturally occurring piperidine alkaloids were synthesised and also found to display high antifeedant activities in laboratory tests. Structure-activity relationships were evaluated for methoxy substituted benzaldehydes, benzoic acids and cinnamic aldehydes, -acids, -esters and -alcohols. While the carboxylic acids were inactive or even feeding stimulants, the aldehydes were the most active antifeedantsQC 2011012...|$|R
40|$|The {{developments}} of the artificial football surface have grown quickly the past years; not only on professional level but also amateur football use these fields (artificial surface). There are hundreds of football fields today with the new developed surface {{around the country and}} also many smaller fields for training purpose. This new surface is always under development and the traditional fields (grass fields) that where frequent, with short fibers have now been replaced of long-haired artificial grass with rubber crush,   which are more like the traditional grass. The rubber or gum crush is a material called "gummigranulat" that appear in many types, but is usually made out of old recycled car tires. The national <b>chemicals</b> <b>inspectorate</b> published a report in February 2006. The report discussed the rubber and if the material could have some risk on the environment and health risks, despite that the risks are very small. There is no prohibition today against the rubber crush and therefore {{there is no reason to}} change existing football fields, but in long term should rubber from recycle car tires be replaced by alternative material to minimize environment and health risks. The purpose with this degree project is to examine what artificial surface are and what advantages is has in relation to natural grass, also the environment risks are going to be discussed and which environmental pollutions that can be avoid and how it influences the economics.   The advantages of using the artificial surface versus the traditional grass are: Ø Always even and smooth surface Ø Less damages with even surface Ø Not as slippery as natural grass Ø Better technical condition Ø Artificial surface stand the strain better Ø Higher durability Ø Can be used all -the -year- around Ø The possibility to arrange larger events such as concerts is easier on artificial surface than traditional grass. By studying the results from this project, following facts are shown: Ø Artificial grass has a higher length of life than natural grass Ø Many more advantages with artificial grass Ø It is 10 times cheaper to run and to maintain artificial grass in comparison to the usage of it. Ø SBR rubber is the best and most profitable rubber that is used Ø There is no proof that SBR rubber release dangerous chemicals, the rubber is soft and harmles...|$|R
