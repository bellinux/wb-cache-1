40|$|The {{management}} phosphates in freshwater {{has significant}} importance to regulate eutrophication. Phosphate excess leads to highly undesirable changes in ecosystems st ructure. The increasing of water body trophicity {{can result in}} water quality deterioration. This paper presents the testing results of reactive materials used for phosphorus removal from wastewater at sewage treatment plant. Twelve materi als of different origin available in Belarus were tested as potential reactive material s for phosphates removal. They are natural materials, industrial by-products and manufactured sorbents. Based on chemical composition the available and inexpensive materials rich in Al, Fe, Mg and Ca were selected. Relationship between purification degree of phosphates and specific material consumption (mg/mg PO[4]{ 3 –}) was investigated to choose potential reactive materials for phosphorus. Four materials (wa-ter conditioning sludge (WCS), dead-catalyst of petroleum hydrocarbon cracking (DCC), electric arc furnace slug (EAF-slug), dolomite burnt at 700 °C) have been chosen for detailed sorption tests. WCS, DCC, EAF-slug <b>and</b> burnt <b>dolomite</b> have the apparent sorption capacities of: 13. 6; 21. 2; 35. 3; 70. 8 mg PO[4]{ 3 -}/g respectively.

50|$|In {{geography}} and geology, a cliff is a vertical, or nearly vertical, rock exposure. Cliffs are formed as erosion landforms by {{the processes of}} weathering and erosion. Cliffs are common on coasts, in mountainous areas, escarpments and along rivers. Cliffs are usually formed by rock that is resistant to weathering and erosion. Sedimentary rocks most likely to form cliffs include sandstone, limestone, <b>chalk,</b> <b>and</b> <b>dolomite.</b> Igneous rocks such as granite and basalt also often form cliffs.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{usability}} of composts made of sewage sludge and either straw or leaves used as substrates for growing zonal pelargoniums. The study plants ‘Hot Pink’ cv. of Survivor group and ‘Fire’ cv. of Graffiti group were grown in 5 different substrates. The control substrate was high peat (100 %) deacidified with <b>chalk</b> <b>and</b> <b>dolomite</b> up to pH 5. 8 – 6. 0 and supplemented with 2. 5 g·dm - 3 of Azofoska multicomponent fertilizer. The other four substrates contained two types of composts: SSRS – sewage sludge, straw (1 : 1, v/v) and SSL – sewage sludge, leaves (1 : 1, v/v), mixed with high peat at two different proportions, 1 : 3 (v/v) and 1 : 7 (v/v). Chemical composition of the substrates was investigated and they were supplemented with nitrogen and potassium as recommended for pelargoniums. Plant morphological parameters were evaluated during flowering. They included plant height and diameter, number of shoots and leaves, leaf assimilation area and leaf weight. Leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid content was also estimated. Inflorescence related parameters included inflorescence diameter and inflorescence stem length, number of flowers per inflorescence and flower diameter. All inflorescences formed over 10 weeks of flowering were counted. Plant ornamental value was assessed using a five-score bonitation scale. The investigated composts were found to be useful components of the substrates for zonal pelargonium production. Irrespective of the compost share, the tested substrates significantly affected most of the evaluated morphological traits. The substrate containing the compost made of sewage sludge and straw (SSRS) and peat (1 : 3, v/v) was found the most beneficial for pelargonium foliage, i. e. the number of leaves, their fresh weight and assimilation area. Leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid content in the pelargoniums grown in the substrates containing either dose of SSRS compost did not differ from the control plants. Substrate type did not affect bonitation score of ‘Survivor Hot Pink’ cultivar. The bonitation score of ‘Graffiti Fire’ cultivar was the highest for plants growing in the substrates with either SSRS or SSL compost plus peat in 1 : 3 ratio (v/v) ...|$|E

40|$|Stratigraphic {{position}} {{and age of}} the so called Cordevolian limestone <b>and</b> <b>dolomite</b> in the Slovenian part of the Southern Alps (figure 1) is a long lasting problem. Its name originates from the (somewhere abandoned) Cordevolian substage (Lower Carnian). Limestone <b>and</b> <b>dolomite</b> both correspond to the Cassian dolomite from the Italian Southern Alps. Platform type of limestone <b>and</b> <b>dolomite,</b> which could be genetic and time equivalent with the Ladinian Schlern (Scilliar) dolomite, is unknown in Slovenia. In the NE part of the Kamnik–Savinja Alps, the Korošica formation (Upper Ladinian) overlies platform limestone <b>and</b> <b>dolomite</b> of the Ojstrica Formation (Ladinian). Diplopora annulata is also present in the Ojstrica formation. Various Ladinian rocks in the Julian Alps and Southern Karavanke are mainly of the Lover Ladinian age, whereas the overlying massive limestone <b>and</b> <b>dolomite</b> (“Cordevolian limestone <b>and</b> dolomite”) are partially of the Ladinian and partially of the Carnian age. There are no Upper Ladinian “Wengen” beds in the carbonate massive, so {{it is impossible to}} draw a time line between the Ladinian and the Carnian stages.

The difference is explained {{on the basis of the}} structure variation of the two minerals.
