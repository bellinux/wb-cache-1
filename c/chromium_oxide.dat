The neural network computation was applied to the evaluation of viscosity for slags containing <b>chromium</b> <b>oxides,</b> and the prediction of viscosity in FeCr process slag was conducted.

25|$|One of {{the most}} crucial factors in {{successfully}} crystallising an artificial gemstone is obtaining highly pure starting material, with at least 99.9995% purity. In the case of manufacturing rubies or sapphires, this material is alumina. The presence of sodium impurities is especially undesirable, as it makes the crystal opaque. Depending on the desired colouration of the crystal, small quantities of various oxides are added, such as <b>chromium</b> <b>oxide</b> for a red ruby, or ferric oxide and titania for a blue sapphire. Other starting materials include titania for producing rutile, or titanyl double oxalate for producing strontium titanate. Alternatively, small, valueless crystals of the desired product can be used.|$|E
25|$|The {{process was}} {{designed}} {{primarily for the}} synthesis of rubies, which became the first gemstones to be synthetically produced, thanks {{to the efforts of}} Fremy and Verneuil. However, the Verneuil process could also be used for the production of other stones, including blue sapphire, which simply required ferric oxide to be substituted for <b>chromium</b> <b>oxide,</b> as well as more elaborate ones, such as star sapphires, where titania (titanium dioxide) was added and the boule was kept in the heat longer, allowing needles of rutile to crystallise within it. In 1947, the Linde Air Products division of Union Carbide pioneered the use of the Verneuil process for creating such star sapphires, until production was discontinued in 1974 due to overseas competition.|$|E

500|$|Verdigris is made {{by placing}} a plate or blade of copper, brass or bronze, {{slightly}} warmed, into a vat of fermenting wine, leaving it there for several weeks, and then scraping off and drying the green powder that forms on the metal. The process of making verdigris was described in ancient times by Pliny. It {{was used by the}} Romans in the murals of Pompeii, and in Celtic medieval manuscripts as early as the 5th century AD. It produced a blue-green which no other pigment could imitate, but it had drawbacks; it was unstable, it could not resist dampness, it did not mix well with other colors, it could ruin other colors with which it came into contact., and it was toxic. Leonardo da Vinci, in his treatise on painting, warned artists not to use it. It was widely used in miniature paintings in Europe and Persia in the 16th and 17th centuries. Its use largely ended in the late 19th century, when it was replaced by the safer and more stable chrome green. Viridian, also called chrome green, is a pigment made with <b>chromium</b> <b>oxide</b> dihydrate, was patented in 1859. [...] It became popular with painters, since, unlike other synthetic greens, it was stable and not toxic. Vincent van Gogh used it, along with Prussian blue, to create a dark blue sky with a greenish tint in his painting Cafe terrace at night.|$|E

40|$|This paper relates {{attempts}} to use square wave voltammetry (SWV) {{for the analysis}} of certain additive in molten silicate glasses. Iron, sulfur, and <b>chromium</b> <b>oxides</b> were investigated; first, individual studies of the compounds allowed us to identify the peak potential for each element at each oxidation state and to correlate the peak currents with e species.

The glass industry is constantly looking for ways to monitor the composition of molten glasses used in manu-facturing processes as they leave the fusion bath. The tem-perature at that point is between 1100 and 1300 ~ and the glass is therefore a viscous liquid.

40|$|With {{the aims}} of {{understanding}} the protective mechanism of chromate conversion coatings and developing alternatives to chromate treatments, the physical natures and corrosion properties of Cr(VI) and Cr(III) treated zinc have been investigated in this work. The Cr(VI) treatments were carried out in dichromate and sulfuric acid solution with different dipping times. The Cr(III) treatments were carried out in two commercial solutions (A and B). The thickness of the coatings was measured using ellipsometry. The morphologies and the compositions of the treated zinc have been studied by means of SEM, AFM, AES, FTIR and XPS. The drying temperature influence on the corrosion performance of the Cr(VI) âtreated zinc has been investigated. The Volta potential in treated and untreated areas has been measured using scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) and SKPFM. The corrosion behavior of the Cr(VI) and Cr(III) treated zinc has been investigated using polarization, electrochemical impedance measurements (EIS), and salt spray tests. Both Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species were detected by XPS in the outermost layer of the Cr(VI) coatings, while no Cr(VI) species {{was found in the}} Cr(III) coatings.
