40|$|On 24 March 1991, global ultra-low-frequency (ULF) {{pulsations}} (1. 1 - 3. 3 mHz) {{observed in}} the magnetosphere {{as well as on}} the ground were studied via analyzing magnetic field data obtained from a global network, comprising ground-based observatories and geosynchronous satellites. In the magnetosphere, the compressional and transverse components of the magnetic fields recorded at two satellites, GOES 6 and GOES 7, showed dominant fluctuations when they were in the vicinity of the noon sector, whereas the transverse fluctuations became dominant when they were at the dawn side. Similarly, on the ground, the H and D components had major fluctuations along with an increase in amplitude from low to high geomagnetic latitudes. In addition, the amplitude of the ULF pulsation was enhanced at the dawn and dusk sides. The geomagnetic pulsations propagated anti-sunward and were of counterclockwise and <b>clockwise</b> elliptical <b>polarizations</b> at the dawn and dusk sides respectively. The counterclockwise elliptical polarization reversed to a <b>clockwise</b> elliptical <b>polarization</b> at geomagnetic local noon and linear polarization was observed during the reversal. It appears that the analysis of the global network data not only provided us with a study of the characteristics of the waves in the magnetosphere and on the ground but also provided us with correlations between the geosynchronous and ground observations, which should be essential to the determination of possible mechanisms of this storm-related wave event...|$|R
40|$|Pc 5 -type {{magnetic}} field pulsations are detected by the IMP- 8 spacecraft well inside the Earth's magnetotail lobes. The three studied events {{with an average}} duration of 3 h and mean amplitude of &# 916;B/B= 6. 6 % show a strong longitudinal oscillation. The <b>clockwise</b> <b>polarization</b> sense of the {{magnetic field}} arrowheads in the north lobe (as well as the counterclockwise in the south lobe) on the XZ plane is consistent with that expected when periodic solar wind lateral pressures squeeze the magnetotail axisymmetrically while moving tailward. In the two case studies, the latter property {{has been found to}} concur with quasi-periodic upstream density fluctuations detected by ISEE- 3 and/or ISSE- 1. The lobe magnetic field oscillations are classified in two distinct modes. The manifestations of the first mode are tailward-travelling waves detectable along the By and Bz magnetic field traces (i. e., with regard to the Bz the spacecraft encounters constantly the same conspicuous signature of south-then-north tilting of field lines around each local compression region). The second mode is associated with prolonged periods of extremely low geomagnetic activity and exhibits a signature along the By component inconsistent with travelling waves. Thus, the maxima of compressions occur simultaneously with the maxima of By excursions: a feature that is explained in terms of tail-aligned current density flowing at the boundary which separates the stable magnetic field in the tail lobe from the very irregular in the magnetosheath. In this case, the spacecraft was located {{in the vicinity of the}} high-latitude tail boundary and the observed By excursions are consistent with those anticipated by the tail-aligned current polarity, which is determined by the dominant By-component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). On the plane YZ we observe an almost linear and circular polarization sense of the vector magnetic field for the first and second mode, respectively...|$|E
40|$|A unique 32 hour {{interval}} of very northward Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) on October 22 - 24, 2003 created a exceptionally thick cold dense magnetotail plasma sheet, a small polar cap and accompanying small tail lobe. These features were detected by the Cluster DMSP and FAST spacecraft and modeled by a global simulation {{as described in}} papers by Oieroset et al. (2005) and Li et al. (2005). During the same interval the Wind spacecraft was passing {{through the center of}} the magnetotail about 130 Re downstream of Earth. Wind results will be described that reveal a very unusual magnetotail characterized by (1) continual tailward flow of 200 - 400 km/s with densities in the range 0. 2 - 3 /cc, both of whch are clearly less than those expected in the magnetosheath, (2) a mostly northward Bz but with a predominant Bx field component with sign reversals indicating crossings between the two hemispheres of the tail, and (3) velocity waves superposed on the downstream flow with peak-to-peak amplitudes of 100 to 200 km/s, periods of 10 to 20 minutes and <b>clockwise</b> <b>polarization.</b> Low altitude DMSP and Fast measurements reveal an auroral oval with enhanced latitudinal thickness and a small polar cap filled with structured precipitzting electrons and few ions. A new global MHD simulation of the event exhibits a highly elliptical tail of diminished cross-section at 130 Re with major axis aligned with the northward IMF. The tail current sheet also tends to be aligned in a north-south direction with the two tail hemispheres to the east and west with their polarities depending on prior history of the IMF. The simulation appears to be consistent with many, but not all, of the observations. High latitude cusp reconnection and subsequent downtail flow of closed field lines may explain the tail structure, but the waves are more likely due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability often thought to occur during northward IMF conditions...|$|E
40|$|The Arctic has {{undergone}} tremendous changes the last decades, including a strong decline in sea ice extent and thickness. The rapid pace of Arctic changes {{relative to the}} global changes are known as Arctic amplification, and {{has been referred to}} as the ‘canary in the coalmine’ of the present climate changes. Factors contributing to the accelerated changes are the ice-albedo effect, and the vast heat reservoir of Atlantic water flowing in the ocean below. This study has aimed to describe and quantify the influence of oceanic heat on the heat budget at the ocean’s upper boundary. There is a delicate heat balance at the interface between the atmosphere, the sea ice and the ocean. A small change in heat flux can have large effect on the ice cover. While the Arctic Ocean is generally not a very energetic one, the recent changes has raised concern about whether internal wave energy and the importance of vertical mixing processes are increasing. Reductions in sea ice extent may allow for more momentum transfer from the atmosphere to the ocean, either mixing the surface layer directly, or initiating inertial oscillations in the boundary layer. Near-inertial internal waves may propagate into the interior and cause mixing away from the surface boundary layer. An increase in vertical mixing in the Arctic Ocean may bring up more heat from the underlying warm Atlantic Water, posing a further threat to the diminishing Arctic sea ice. The study is based on observations from two different campaigns, both located in the region north of Svalbard. First, under-ice boundary layer and upper ocean measurements made during the winter-to-spring drift campaign N-ICE 2015. Second, a yearlong deployment of three moorings on the slope of the Yermak Plateau is used to study the near-inertial wave field by the plateau. From an under-ice turbulence mast, a unique data set of winter-time measurements over the deep basin is obtained. Direct measurements of heat fluxes are weakly positive, even in winter, which are roughly doubled during storm events. Individual events can cause an order of magnitude increase in fluxes. A one-dimensional vertical diffusion model based on the observations from the drift satisfactorily reproduced observed changes in upper ocean winter hydrography. The model further suggests that observed salinity increase in the mixed layer was dominated by entrainment of saline water from below, rather than brine rejection from ice growth. In spring, coincident with drift over the shallower topography, where the warm Atlantic Water is found at shallow depths, heat fluxes below the sea ice are much higher. Varying by one to two orders of magnitude, heat fluxes are highly dependent on the depth of the warm water layers, the wind forcing and its effect on the ice cover. Highest heat fluxes exceeded 100 Wm− 2 over several hours, during a wind event in the marginal ice zone. From a subset of the under-ice turbulence measurements, during sea ice melt in June, heat and salt fluxes are found to be inversely correlated. This is contrary to expectations of positive heat- and salt fluxes during sea ice melt. This is hypothesized to origin in salt released from the melting sea ice. Objective criteria are used to identify 131 salty plumes descending past the measurement volume, accounting for 9 % of the salt fluxes in only 0. 5 % of the time. The accumulated salt flux indicate a near full desalination of the sea ice. The reduction in bulk salinity of two nearby ice cores, taken three days apart, agree with accumulated salt flux within a factor of two. Plumes have previously only been observed from land-fast ice in a Svalbard fjord. The study confirms its existence on drifting Arctic sea ice, with implications for the understanding of salt and freshwater distribution in the under-ice boundary layer, and brine drainage in sea ice. From the southwestern Yermak Plateau, the near-inertial field was analyzed in yearlong records from three moorings. The near-inertial signal is clockwise dominant, indicative of downward energy propagation. The <b>clockwise</b> <b>polarization</b> is stronger closer to the surface, further suggesting surface generation by winds. Examples of wind-generated near-inertial wave propagation are presented, and wave group properties are calculated. At mid-depth and in the deep, episodic events of elevated near-inertial horizontal kinetic energy can be caused by surface generation at a remote location, or by tidal currents interacting with the rough topography. Theoretical characteristic beam paths initiated at the shelf break are consistent with the mid-depth elevation in near-inertial horizontal kinetic energy. The sum of these observations further highlight the importance and complexity of ocean mixing processes, both at the ice-ocean interface and at depth. The Yermak Plateau is a region of significant internal wave generation and energetic turbulence, and will be an important and interesting region for further studies. The diapycnal mixing taking place here is key in determining the vertical exchange of heat between inflowing Atlantic water and the surface, and the fate of this heat in the Arctic basins. </p...|$|E
30|$|One {{peculiar}} observational {{feature is}} circular polarization of horizontal electric field variation and we succeeded in explaining this feature {{in terms of}} resonance-like motion of ion in groundwater under the Earth’s magnetic field. In particular, left-handed (counterclockwise) circular polarization, if seen towards the magnetic lines of force, {{is found to be}} associated with anions with negative electric charge. Similarly, right-handed (<b>clockwise)</b> circular <b>polarization</b> is associated with cations with positive charge. The magnitude of generated electric field is obviously proportional to the magnitude of ground velocity. It also depends on the number density of ions in groundwater. However, the most striking feature is the resonance-like behavior.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The DiSEqC {{standard}} is briefly introduced, and a DiSEqC-compatible power supply circuit with the MAX 1771 is introduced. The application circuit provides the required 22 kHz pulse-position-modulated (PPM) signal, {{as well as}} the 13 V or 17 V output selection. The circuit also provides a comparator circuit for detecting data transmitted by the satellite antenna assembly. The circuit of Figure 1 provides a digitally switchable 13 V or 17 V for the low-noise block (LNB) typically found in satellite receivers at the antenna feedhorn. This variation of supply voltage "tells " the remotely located LNB electronics whether it should set the antenna <b>polarization</b> <b>clockwise</b> or counterclockwise, which thereby eliminates the need for an interface and cable connection to the antenna.

40|$|One of {{the warmest}} water masses beneath Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf (FRIS) is dense, high {{salinity}} shelf water (HSSW) that {{flows into the}} sub-ice-shelf cavity from the ice front and occupies the lower portion of the water column. A one-dimensional turbulence closure ocean model {{has been applied to}} this high latitude sub-ice-shelf environment to demonstrate that tidal currents mix HSSW vertically through the water column and cause melting {{at the bottom of the}} ice shelf. Significantly FRIS lies near the critical latitude for the semidiurnal tide, where the Coriolis frequency equals the tidal frequency, resulting in a strongly depth-dependent tidal current and thick boundary layers. Using the model, the effect of the critical latitude, stratification, and the polarization of the tidal current ellipse on boundary layer structure and subsequent vertical mixing are examined. The model shows that stratification significantly affects how the shape of the tidal current ellipse varies with depth and that both the depth to which the pycnocline initially develops and the longer term melt rates are highly dependent on tidal current ellipse polarization. The sensitivity to both the stratification and the polarization are due, in large part, to the proximity of the critical latitude. Positive polarizations (anticlockwise rotating current vectors) quickly develop deeper pycnoclines and maintain higher melt rates than negative <b>polarizations</b> (<b>clockwise</b> rotating current vectors). For many areas beneath FRIS the polarization ranges from - 0. 3 to + 0. 3; here the modeled pycnocline development is sensitive to polarization, though the effect on the time-averaged melt rate is suppressed for positive polarizations. However, in key areas where the polarization exceeds +/- 0. 3 and the ellipses are more open and circular, the effects of polarization are significant. Levels of tidal mixing and associated melting vary by more than an order of magnitude over the whole tidal ellipse polarization range, showing that very different mixing and melting regimes are present beneath FRIS...|$|R
