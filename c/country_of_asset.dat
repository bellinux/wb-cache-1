40|$|Europe is {{struggling}} with {{the resolution of the}} severe debt crisis and {{is in the process of}} overhauling its institutional set up. One element of the reform agenda is the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) which is intended to provide liquidity assistance to countries in case financial stability in the Euro Area is at stake. The ESM shall enter into force in July 2012, following ratification of the member states. It will have five instruments at its disposal: direct loans to <b>countries,</b> purchases <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> on the primary or secondary market, contingent credit lines, and funds for bank recapitalization. In this contribution, it is argued that establishing an explicit crisis resolution mechanism is in principle useful. However, the ESM is defined too broadly, and its scope should be limited to the provision of emergency liquidity assistance only under narrowly defined circumstances. Using the option to recapitalize banks might help addressing a potential debt overhang problem. Yet, the current framework has deficiencies in this regard and lacks the necessary backing by complementary institutional reforms, notably a regime for cross-border bank resolution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a stylized model {{of international trade}} and asset price bubbles. Its central insight is that bubbles tend to appear and expand in countries where productivity is low relative {{to the rest of the}} world. These bubbles absorb local savings, eliminating inefficient investments and liberating resources that are in part used to invest in high productivity countries. Through this channel, bubbles act as a substitute for international capital flows, improving the international allocation of investment and reducing rate-of-return differentials across <b>countries.</b> This view <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> price bubbles could eventually provide a simple account of some real world phenomenae that have been difficult to model before, such as the recurrence and depth of financial crises or their puzzling tendency to propagate across countries...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of {{transitory}} income shocks (fluctuations in output, for example) on the current account in a two-country world. According to the standard intertemporal approach (or “the traditional rule”) to the current account, the variation in the current account {{is equal to the}} amount of saving generated by a transitory income shock in all countries. In contrast, Kraay and Ventura (2000, p. 1137) brilliantly argue that “the current account response is equal to the saving generated by the shock multiplied by the <b>country’s</b> share <b>of</b> foreign <b>assets</b> in total assets”, which they have termed “the new rule”. Here we propose an extension of the new rule to a two-country world. Then we study the empirical relevance of the extended new rule in contrast to either the traditional rule or the new rule. We find that the extended new rule adds important insights, even though the empirical validation is not completely satisfactory. intertemporal approach, current account, traditional rule, new rule...|$|R

Bank nonperforming loans to total gross loans are steadily increasing from 11.3 % in 2011 to 14.5 % in 2015.6 This deterioration is mainly {{due to the}} lack of effective supervisory instruments and rigorous prudential regulation.

Tunisian banks continue to rely on traditional balance sheet intermediation activities, despite reforms to encourage banks to develop market activities and provide more personalized services to customers. The Tunisian banking sector is also characterized by the deterioration of its exploitation coefficient. 10 In 2015, operating expenses accounted for 49.1 % 11 of net banking income.
