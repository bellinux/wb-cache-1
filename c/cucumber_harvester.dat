He was born in Labbakang, in the south Celebes, and owned {{one of the first}} trepanging {{licences}} issued by the South Australian Government. His published accounts and memoirs - for his lived well into the 20th century - have formed the basis for great study in the history of Australia-Indonesia relations.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} research on inverse kinematics algorithms {{to be used in}} a functional model of a cucumber harvesting robot consisting of a redundant manipulator with one prismatic and six rotational joints (P 6 R). Within a first generic approach, the inverse kinematics problem was reformulated as a non-linear programming problem and solved with a generic algorithm. Solutions were easily obtained, but the considerable calculation time needed to solve the problem prevented on line implementation. To circumvent this problem, a second, less generic approach was developed consisting of a mixed numerical-analytic solution of the inverse kinematics problem exploiting the particular structure of the P 6 R manipulator. This approach facilitated rapid and robust calculation of the inverse kinematics of the <b>cucumber</b> <b>harvester.</b> During {{the early stages of the}} cucumber harvesting project, this inverse kinematics algorithm was used to off-line evaluate the ability of the robot to harvest cucumbers using 3 D-information of a cucumber crop obtained in a real greenhouse. Thereafter, the algorithm was employed successfully in a functional model of the <b>cucumber</b> <b>harvester</b> to determine if cucumbers were hanging within the reachable workspace of the robot and to determine a collision-free harvest posture to be used for motion control of the manipulator during harvesting...|$|E

Within a first generic approach, the inverse kinematics problem was reformulated as a non-linear programming problem and solved with a Genetic Algorithm (GA). Although solutions were easily obtained, the considerable calculation time needed to solve the problem prevented on-line implementation. To circumvent this problem, a second, less generic, approach was developed which consisted of a mixed numerical-analytic solution of the inverse kinematics problem exploiting the particular structure of the P 6 R manipulator. Using the latter approach, calculation time was considerably reduced.

The inverse kinematics algorithm is presented and demonstrated with some illustrative examples of cucumber harvesting, both off-line during the design phase as well as on-line during a field test...|$|E
