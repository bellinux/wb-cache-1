25|$|A grid (known as the Parity Grid) of {{bilateral}} rates was calculated {{on the basis}} of these central rates expressed in ECUs, and <b>currency</b> <b>fluctuations</b> had to be contained within a margin of 2.25% on either side of the bilateral rates (with the exception of the Italian lira, the Spanish peseta, the Portuguese escudo and the pound sterling, which were allowed to fluctuate by ±6%). Determined intervention and loan arrangements protected the participating currencies from greater exchange rate fluctuations.|$|E
25|$|Boeing's {{production}} costs are mostly in United States dollars, whereas Airbus' {{production costs}} are mostly in Euro. When the dollar appreciates against the euro {{the cost of}} producing a Boeing aircraft rises relatively {{to the cost of}} producing an Airbus aircraft, and conversely when the dollar falls relative to the euro it is an advantage for Boeing. There are also possible currency risks and benefits involved in the way aircraft are sold. Boeing typically prices its aircraft only in dollars, while Airbus, although pricing most aircraft sales in dollars, has been known to be more flexible and has priced some aircraft sales in Asia and the Middle East in multiple currencies. Depending on <b>currency</b> <b>fluctuations</b> between the acceptance of the order and the delivery of the aircraft this can result in an extra profit or extra expense—or, if Airbus has purchased insurance against such fluctuations, an additional cost regardless.|$|E

This account is intended to maintain the spending power of funds appropriated for ABMC operations {{in the event that}} the U. S. dollar depreciates against the currencies used to pay for these operations, which include designing, constructing, operating, and maintaining permanent American military burial grounds in foreign countries. In light of recent low foreign <b>currency</b> <b>fluctuation</b> account levels, the appropriations committees' conferees were concerned with the failure of OMB to adequately address the effect of foreign <b>currency</b> rate <b>fluctuations</b> on ABMC in its original budget submission for fiscal year 2005, or through a supplementary budget request. In response to this mandate, we examined (1) ABMC's method of forecasting exchange rates in preparing budgets for the foreign <b>currency</b> <b>fluctuation</b> account prior to its fiscal year 2006 budget submission and OMB guidance on that method; (2) changes that occurred in the ABMC foreign <b>currency</b> <b>fluctuation</b> fund as the dollar depreciated in value relative to the currencies used by ABMC in its operations; and (3) changes that ABMC made in preparing its fiscal year 2006 budget submission. ...|$|R

It became much more affordable in terms of cost of living relative to cities worldwide, with its ranking moving from 93rd (more expensive) to 139th (less expensive) in 2009, probably as a result of <b>currency</b> <b>fluctuations</b> during the global economic downturn from March 2008 to March 2009.

2500|$|Despite {{government}} policies to increase income {{per capita in}} order to hasten the progress towards high income country by 2020, Malaysia growth in wages has been very slow, lagging behind by OECD standard. Academic research by the IMF and World Bank have repeatedly called for structural reform and endogenous innovation to move the country up the value chain of manufacturing into allowing Malaysia to escape the current middle income trap. Due to a heavy reliance on oil exports for central government revenue, the <b>currency</b> <b>fluctuations</b> has been very volatile, noticeably during the supply glut and oil price collapse in 2015.

30|$|One of the {{significant}} risks of global purchasing is the risk of uncertain changes in the currency exchange rates that affects the total supply chain cost. If the buyer does not consider these changes, selection and purchasing decisions will be suboptimal. It seems necessary that global supplier selection models consider exchange rates fluctuations to cope with challenges that purchasing managers are facing in global environments. The literature seems to be sparse on analytical approaches involving the <b>currency</b> <b>fluctuation</b> uncertainty in the supplier selection process. It {{should be noted that}} it is one of our underlying principles in this research paper. We model the <b>currency</b> <b>fluctuation</b> through a scenario-based approach.

2500|$|A {{report of}} McKinsey and Co. from 2008 found that between 60,000 and 85,000 medical {{tourists}} were {{traveling to the}} United States {{for the purpose of}} receiving in-patient medical care. The same McKinsey study estimated that 750,000 American medical tourists traveled from the United States to other countries in 2007 (up from 500,000 in 2006). [...] The availability of advanced medical technology and sophisticated training of physicians are cited as driving motivators for growth in foreigners traveling to the U.S. for medical care, whereas the low costs for hospital stays and major/complex procedures at Western-accredited medical facilities abroad are cited as major motivators for American travelers. Also, the decline in value of the U.S. dollar between 2007 and 2013 used to offer additional incentives for foreign travel to the U.S., although cost differences between the US and many locations in Asia are larger than any <b>currency</b> <b>fluctuations.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{total exports}} of native produce in 1919 were just under £200,000,000 (630,000,000 taels), {{and the total}} imports {{slightly}} larger. It is better, however, to consider such statistics in taels, because <b>currency</b> <b>fluctuations</b> make the results deceptive when reckoned in sterling. The tael is not a coin, but a certain weight of silver, and therefore its value fluctuates with the value of silver. The China Year Book gives imports and exports of Chinese produce for 1902 as 325 million taels and 214 million taels respectively; for 1911, as 482 and 377; for 1917, as 577 and 462; for 1920, as 762 and 541. (The corresponding figures in pounds sterling for 1911 are 64 millions and 50 millions; for 1917, 124 millions and 99,900,000.) It will thus be seen that, although the foreign trade of China is still small in proportion to population, it is increasing very fast. To a European it is always surprising to find how little the economic life of China is affected by such incidents as revolutions and civil wars.|$|E

The control measures centre about developing resilience and emergency response and preparedness, and design of organizational and operational structure to retain function in the face of adversity and catastrophe.

To conduct that business, they (whether {{one or both}} parties) must pay fees for exchanging one currency for another and they must determine the exchange rate for a particular time.

As an increasing number of international businesses understand that these expensive tasks are unnecessary for trade conducted within a monetary union, these businesses are likely candidates to lead the effort to implement a Single Global Currency, to be managed by a Global Central Bank within a Global Monetary Union.

The aim of study {{is to find a}} pattern of how pricing takes place, if and how airlines implement market segmentation and take demand-related elasticities into account. We specialize on the Scandinavian Airline System (SAS) and German Lufthansa. Their flight prices were collected as primary data from the corresponding websites. We observed the following air travel services: Long-haul international, short-haul international and short-haul domestic; additionally, we differentiated price levels by the time of booking. Based on our findings we can say that the market segmentation model provides a good base for airlines. However, it has to be accompanied by additional strategies to react to arising problems (peak problem, <b>currency</b> <b>fluctuation,</b> etc). The patterns we found implemented by SAS and Lufthansa represent a firm market-responsive approach to the problems in the airline industry. < [...] ...|$|R
40|$|My {{belief is}} that it is in the best {{short-term}} as well as long-term economic interests of U. S. corporations to disengage from South Africa.

This is in addition to normal risks of <b>currency</b> <b>fluctuation</b> and unstable commodity prices. In the long-term, a new majority-ruled government may look else­ where for investments and trade, or will extract a very high price for foreign corporate involvement.
