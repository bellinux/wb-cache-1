5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s Amtrak found {{itself with a}} supply of surplus Metroliner cars with {{problematic}} propulsion systems, but with sound body and frame, stored at their Wilmington and Bear shop complexes in Delaware. The <b>coaches</b> <b>were,</b> except for the propulsion systems, a near-identical match to Amfleet coaches. Twenty-nine of the 31 <b>coaches</b> <b>were</b> renumbered and used as cab control cars for corridor services. This allowed trains to operate in push-pull service, rather than needing to be turned around on a wye at terminals or to have a locomotive on each end.|$|E
5|$|These {{were also}} deemed commercially unviable, and the scheme was {{abandoned}} with no services ever operated. In 2000 the <b>coaches</b> <b>were</b> sold to Via Rail in Canada.|$|E

Ninety-two of these wooden compartment carriages were built, fitted with pressurised gas lighting and steam heating. Electric lighting had replaced the gas by 1917 and electric heaters were added in 1922 to provide warmth when hauled by an electric locomotive. Later formed into rakes of five, six or seven coaches, conductor rail pick-ups on the leading and trailing guard <b>coaches</b> <b>were</b> joined by a bus line and connected to the electric locomotive to help prevent gapping. Two rakes were formed with a Pullman coach that provided a buffet service for a supplementary fare. The Vintage Carriages Trust has three preserved Dreadnought carriages.|$|E
5|$|On April 2, the Bears began a {{voluntary}} offseason program, {{and because they}} had a new head coach, the Bears were given a two-week earlier start than teams that did not hire a new head coach.

5|$|When the Central London Railway {{opened in}} 1900, it used {{camel-back}} electric locomotives hauling six-car trains. The locomotives weighed 44 tons and were largely unsprung, causing severe vibration problems in properties near the line. In {{an effort to}} resolve the problem, four of the <b>coaches</b> <b>were</b> fitted with motors, in the first trial in Britain of the Sprague-Thomson-Houston multiple unit control system. The trials were a success, and multiple unit trains were running by 1903. Two of the trial cars, numbers 201 and 202, were retained {{and became the first}} ballast motor cars to work on the Underground. They worked in this form until about 1910, when batteries were fitted. They were renumbered L22 and L23 in 1929, and were scrapped in 1936 and 1937.|$|E
5|$|After the 2004 season, four Trojan {{assistant}} <b>coaches</b> <b>were</b> {{offered and}} took jobs elsewhere.

Carroll rebuilt his staff by elevating Ken Norton, Jr. from graduate assistant to full-time assistant coaching the linebackers, and hiring Steve Sarkisian, who was with the Oakland Raiders in 2004 and was formerly with the Trojans, as quarterbacks coach. Pat Ruel, who was with the New York Giants in 2004, to coach the offensive line, and Jethro Franklin, who spent 2004 with the Green Bay Packers, as defensive line coach, Sarkisian would additionally be named as assistant head coach and Lane Kiffin, wide receivers coach, would add recruiting and offensive coordinating to his duties.|$|E
30|$|However, {{the experts}} focused on {{possible}} threats {{and challenges of}} coaching as well. As a result of simplified approach to coaching {{from the side of}} some organisations, {{there is a lot of}} misunderstanding what happens around the coaching. The organisations misunderstand what <b>coaching</b> <b>is</b> and what <b>coaching</b> can do, who should need coaching, and what <b>coaching</b> <b>is</b> for. There is also misunderstanding from the other side of those who deliver <b>coaching.</b> Sometimes <b>coaching</b> <b>is</b> wrong intervention and people need training or mentoring that will be more effective than coaching. The dependence on <b>coach</b> <b>is</b> also considered as potential threat. The experts consider that <b>coach</b> <b>is</b> responsible to recognize if the client is dependable.|$|R
