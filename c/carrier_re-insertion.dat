50|$|Demodulation {{is done by}} {{multiplying}} the DSB-SC signal {{with the}} carrier signal just like the modulation process. This resultant signal is then passed through a low pass filter to produce a scaled version of original message signal. DSB-SC can be demodulated by a simple envelope detector, like AM, if the modulation index is less than unity. Full depth modulation requires <b>carrier</b> <b>re-insertion.</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} prototype {{is presented}} that illustrates the implementation aspects and feasibility {{of the novel}} ring resonator-based optical beamformer concept that has been developed and analyzed in Part I of this paper. This concept {{can be used for}} seamless control of the reception angle in broadband wireless receivers employing a large phased array antenna (PAA). The design, fabrication, and characterization of a dedicated chip are described, in which an 8 × 1 optical beamforming network, an optical sideband filter for single-sideband suppressed carrier modulation, and a <b>carrier</b> <b>re-insertion</b> coupler for balanced optical detection are integrated. The chip was designed for satellite television reception using a broadband PAA, and was realized in a low-loss, CMOS-compatible optical waveguide technology. Tuning is performed thermo-optically, with a switching time of 1 ms. Group delay response and power response measurements show the correct operation of the OBFN and OSBF, respectively. Measurements on a complete beamformer prototype (including the electro-optical and opto-electrical conversions) demonstrate an optical sideband suppression of 25 dB, RF-to-RF delay generation up to 0. 63 ns with a phase accuracy better than π/ 10 radians, and coherent combining of four RF input signals, all in a frequency range of 1 – 2 GHz...|$|E
