50|$|Metal is {{drained from}} the tundish through another shroud {{into the top}} of an open-base copper mold. The depth of the mold can range from 0.5 to 2 m, {{depending}} on the <b>casting</b> <b>speed</b> and section size. The mold is water-cooled to solidify the hot metal directly in contact with it; this is the primary cooling process. It also oscillates vertically (or in a near vertical curved path) to prevent the metal sticking to the mold walls. A lubricant (either powders that melt on contact with the metal, or liquids) is added to the metal in the mold to prevent sticking, and to trap any slag particles - including oxide particles or scale - that may be present in the metal and bring them {{to the top of the}} pool to form a floating layer of slag. The shroud is set so the hot metal exits it below the surface of the slag layer in the mold and is thus called a submerged entry nozzle (SEN). In some cases, shrouds may not be used between tundish and mold ('open-pour' casting); in this case, interchangeable metering nozzles in the base of the tundish direct the metal into the moulds. Some continuous casting layouts feed several molds from the same tundish.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{purposes}} of revamping the No. 2 - 3 caster was to have annual production capacity of 3. 5 million tonnes per year for automotive application. Under a given caster length of 47 m, the basic requirement under this value is to achieve 2. 7 m/min <b>casting</b> <b>speed</b> for 250 mm x 1600 mm in slab section. In order to ensure stable operation for this high <b>casting</b> <b>speed,</b> many technologies were newly developed and implemented during the revamping process. The roller geometry was designed to minimize mould level hunting due to unsteady bulging. The concept of Intensive secondary cooling was applied to shorten crater end position as well as to decrease corner transverse cracking by applying the concepts of surface structure control [1]. A movable multi-mode electromagnetic system was designed to control mould flow to meet diverse operation conditions.

40|$|The {{need for}} lighter weight {{vehicles}} to improve fuel efficiency {{is becoming increasingly}} imperative. Sheet magnesium alloys offer the potential as a light weight material {{for use in the}} transportation industry due to their high specific strength and stiffness. In fact, magnesium alloys have the highest strength-to-weight ratio of all the common structural metals. Though the demand for light weight materials is present and sheet magnesium is available, the use of these materials in automotive applications has been rather limited due to high production costs and poor corrosion performance and formability. A promising process to produce wrought magnesium sheet in a more cost effective manner is Twin Roll Casting (TRC). In addition, enhanced corrosion resistance and ductility may be realized in these sheet alloys with the possible introduction of a clad layer during the TRC process thereby producing a laminate sheet where the surface properties are different from the core. The focus of this research was to investigate the potential of cladding magnesium alloy AZ 31 material during the TRC process. As part of this research, a thermal fluid mathematical model of the TRC process was developed, which was then further refined to include the addition of a clad layer during the process. The TRC model was validated through experimental work conducted at the Pohang Institute of Science and Technology (POSTECH University), where TRC experiments of AZ 31 were conducted under various casting conditions. The as-cast microstructure of the AZ 31 sheets were characterized and measurements of the secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) made at the mid-region were compared to predicted microstructures from the TRC model based on solidification history. The predicted SDAS matched with the measured values, thus, validating the model. Using the validated TRC model the feasibility of adding a clad layer was assessed and various simulations were conducted to observe the effects of <b>cast</b> <b>speed,</b> <b>cast</b> thickness, and clad material on the thermal history and temperature profile in both the clad and core domains. The material properties and clad thickness did not seem to impact the temperature profiles significantly, while the <b>cast</b> <b>speed</b> and initial temperature dictated whether or not the cast would be successful. Using these operational parameters a process window was created (based on the CANMET facility) to illustrate the feasibility of casting and cladding during TRC. This window is beneficial for future experimentation and understanding the effects of these casting parameters...|$|R

Its adaptation to casting of bulk amorphous alloy strip necessitates matching of the thermal and mechanical behaviour of the cooling multi-component melt to the requirements (especially cooling rate, and strip exit temperature and thermal gradient) of vitrification.

Flat sheet asymmetric membranes were formed using an optimized ternary casting solution. The asymmetric membranes with the molecular-oriented skin layer were prepared by a simple dry/wet phase inversion technique with forced convection using a newly developed pneumatically-controlled casting system. Experimental investigation was conducted focusing on different <b>casting</b> <b>speed,</b> thus representing different rheological conditions. <b>Casting</b> <b>speed</b> was varied from 5 s to 60 s, as known that varying <b>casting</b> <b>speed</b> would vary shear rate. Rheologically induced molecular orientation on the skin layer of membrane was measured using fourier transform attenuated total reflection spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) to examine whether higher shear rate may induce anisotropy at the molecular level of the membrane. These rheological results were then correlated to the gas separation performance in four different pure gases. The results indicated that the highly sheared asymmetric membranes tend to exhibit greater molecular orientation in the skin layer. As the <b>casting</b> <b>speed</b> increased, the level of shear experienced on the membrane surface layer also increased, thus this was leading to greater molecular orientation in the skin layer.

However, steels falling within the peritectic composition range are notoriously difficult to cast by continuous casting techniques and Figure 1 shows an example of shell-thinning in a continuously-cast steel of peritectic composition, the breakout occurring ostensibly as a result of the occurrence of the peritectic phase transition.
