40|$|Crushed {{recycled}} aggregate contains particles with brittle defects such as cracks, pores, and voids. This study presents {{a method for}} {{improving the quality of}} recycled fine aggregate by selectively removing these defects. Fourteen recycled fine aggregates were manufactured by three types of processors including a jaw <b>crusher,</b> <b>ball</b> mill, and granulator. The influence of the recycled fine aggregate on the flowability and strength of the mortar was evaluated by multivariate analysis. The results showed that flowability was mainly affected by the filling fraction of the recycled fine aggregate and the content of components passing through a 0. 075 -mm sieve. Both the compressive and flexural strengths of the recycled mortars were unaffected by the filling fraction, but they were affected by the fraction of defects in the aggregate and its surface smoothness. In addition, the results clearly showed that polishing involved in ball mill or granulator processing is effective both for increasing the filling fraction of recycled fine aggregate and reducing the fraction of defects in the aggregate. Moreover, it was determined that the grain surface of grains was more irregular with the granulator than that with the ball mill, resulting in higher strength of the mortar subjected to the granulator. The fracture configuration resulting from flexural stress on the recycled fine aggregate in the mortar differed according to the type of aggregate. Furthermore, the calculated amounts of emitted CO 2 and the compressive strength of the recycled mortar showed that the recycled fine aggregate should not be polished excessively...|$|E

40|$|The Zweckverband Landeswasserversorgung Stuttgart has {{developed}} {{a new type of}} decarbonization system which makes possible the recovery of ultra pure, industrially usable calcium carbonate by using lime water as a coagulant. The decarbonization process itself takes place on a line of the existing compact flocculation system which is used in the Langenau Waterworks for the treatment of Danube water. The ultra pure lime water is produced in a newly developed lime water preparation system. The whole decarbonization plant was planned for a capacity of 700 l/s. It contains the following systems: slaking of calcium oxide, preparation of lime water, compact flocculation plant, wet <b>ball</b> <b>crusher,</b> storage of thin sludge, centrifuges and loading station for the ultra pure thickened CaCO_ 3 sludge. With the exception of the compact flocculation plant all other parts of the plant had to be built new. After the prototype was put into operation, the lime water preparation system, the wet <b>ball</b> <b>crusher</b> and the centrifuges had to be optimized. Afterwards the whole plant worked very well. Up to now 65 million m" 3 ground water was decarbonized and 50, 000 t of pure CaCO_ 3 have been produced and sold.

40|$|Abstract In the {{beneficiation}} of compact Itabirites, crushing {{and grinding}} account for major operational and capital costs. As such, the study and development of comminution circuits have a fundamental importance for feasibility and optimization of compact Itabirite beneficiation. This work makes a comparison between comminution circuits for compact Itabirites from the Iron Quadrangle. The circuits developed are: a <b>crushing</b> and <b>ball</b> mill circuit (CB), a SAG mill and ball mill circuit (SAB) and a single stage SAG mill circuit (SSSAG). For the SAB circuit, the use of pebble crushing is analyzed (SABC). An industrial circuit for 25 million tons of run of mine was developed for each route from tests on a pilot scale (grinding) and industrial scale. The energy consumption obtained for grinding in the pilot tests was compared with that reported by Donda and Bond. The SSSAG route had the lowest energy consumption, 11. 8 kWh/t and the SAB route had the highest energy consumption, 15. 8 kWh/t.
