50|$|The {{process of}} <b>cryoconcentration</b> resembles {{slightly}} the process indigenous Canadians realized occurred when maple syrup could be concentrated by the cold. After letting it freeze, a piece would be broken off {{which would be}} more concentrated. The process of cryoextraction is inspired directly from the production of ice wine.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{producers}} do {{a second}} <b>cryoconcentration</b> {{to increase the}} initial level of sugar, before fermentation. After that, at the lowest the temperature, the harvested must is fermented in vats for six to seven months before being bottled. This method gives the producer much greater control and involvement over the production process.|$|E
50|$|Ice cider can be {{made from}} two {{processes}} that concentrate the natural sugars within an apple through the use of cold temperatures: <b>cryoconcentration</b> and cryoextraction. The most common apples used for the production of ice cider are McIntosh, Cortland, Empire and Spartan. Due to cryoextraction requiring the apples to remain on the branches later than they are typically picked, new breeds of apple have been developed specifically for the production of ice cider.|$|E
50|$|Ice cider, an {{innovation}} from Quebec, is crafted by pressing apples naturally frozen by winter's cold. Similar {{to the late}} harvest of grapes, apples picked during winter allow for a must with a high sugar content, when water, turned into ice, is separated from the apples. This step is called the <b>cryoconcentration</b> of sugar. The final result, after the fermentation of the must, is a liqueur-like and mellow liquid, containing between 9 and 13% of alcohol.|$|E
50|$|Commission C2 {{food science}} and {{engineering}} is focused more particularly on the application of refrigeration technologies {{in the area of}} food sciences: preservation (refrigeration, freezing); hygiene and safety in its microbiological aspect; process (lyophilisation, <b>cryoconcentration,</b> cryoprecipitation, partial or total crystallisation). The work focuses on establishing a model for the transfer of heat and matter during refrigeration treatments, on the effects of refrigeration on food products, and on the evolution kinetics of products kept in cold storage. The work deals with the impact of the integrity of the cold chain on the quality of food, including in warm climate countries.|$|E
40|$|Freeze {{concentration}} of liquid foods produces high-quality concentrates while retaining the heat-labile compounds found in fresh samples. Centrifugal freeze concentration is a <b>cryoconcentration</b> method assisted by an external force, centrifugation, {{to enhance the}} separation of concentrate from the ice. When applying centrifugal freeze concentration to orange juice, after the third <b>cryoconcentration</b> cycle, the ascorbic acid content in the concentrate showed retention close to 70 % of the initial value. After the third cycle, the solutes in the concentrate increased 4 times the initial value of the fresh sample with 70 % efficiency. The color evaluation showed that the final concentrated fraction was darker than the fresh juice. The centrifugal freeze concentration in orange juice was effective for obtaining a high-quality concentrate with a higher {{concentration of}} solids and ascorbic acid retention...|$|E
40|$|Sour {{cherry and}} orange juice were {{successfully}} cryoconcentrated. Novel clarification (Electro-Flotation and Ultra-Filtration) improved cryconcentration efficiency. EF-UF clarified sour cherry {{and orange juice}}s were cryoconcentrated in three stages up to 34. 52 ± 0. 14, 44. 42 ± 0. 19, 52. 44 ± 0. 13 and 28. 43 ± 0. 16, 40. 51 ± 0. 15, and 45. 42 ± 0. 19 ° Brix at- 10 ˚C respectively. Duncan's multiple range {{test was used to}} compare mean values of various parameters. At similar total soluble solid, cryoconcentrated samples showed significantly (P< 0. 05) higher retention of aroma number, ascorbic acid, and TAA compared to those thermally concentrated. Thermal concentration induced formation of hydroxymethylfurfural more than <b>cryoconcentration</b> process used for concentration of orange juice...|$|E
40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} is here used {{to elucidate}} {{the mechanism of}} protein stabilization by carbohydrates and other additives during freezing. More specifically, we used molecular dynamics simulations to obtain a quantitative estimation of the capability of various cryoprotectants to preserve a model protein, the human growth hormone, against freezing stresses. Three mechanisms were investigated, preferential exclusion, water replacement, and vitrification. Model simulations were finally validated upon experimental data {{in terms of the}} ability of excipients to prevent protein aggregation. Overall, we found that the preferential exclusion and vitrification mechanisms are important during the whole freezing process, while water replacement becomes dominant only {{toward the end of the}} <b>cryoconcentration</b> phase. The disaccharides were found to be the most efficient excipients, in regard to both preferential exclusion and water replacement. Moreover, sugars were in general more efficient than other excipients, such as glycine or sorbitol...|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{interest}} in potato juice as a therapeutic agent {{goes back to}} the 19 th century but its application was not supported by any knowledge about biological activity of this raw material. Factors restricting the medical application of potato juice include its inattractive sensory and functional properties. The aim of the presented investigations was preliminary evaluation of the biological activity of potato juice and the impact on it of some technological operations such as: <b>cryoconcentration</b> and hydrolysis in a membrane reactor. Material and methods. Experiments comprised investigations of antioxidative potentials of fresh potato juice, products of its processing as well as fractions separated because of the size of their molecules using, for this purpose, Folin-Ciocalteu methods and reactions with the ABTS cation radical. Results. The value of the antioxidative potential of fresh potato juice determined by means of the ABTS reagent corresponded to approximately 330 &mu;mol/ 100 g which is in keeping with literature data. As a result of the <b>cryoconcentration</b> process, the value determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method was found to increase only slightly whereas the value determined by means of the ABTS reagent almost tripled. The antioxidative potential was found to grow even more strongly {{in the case of the}} application of both methods when the process of enzymatic hydrolysis was employed. The total of 5 protein fractions of molecular masses ranging from 11 000 Da to over 600 000 Da, as well as an organic non-protein fraction of the molecular mass of 600 Da, were obtained as a result of the performed separation. All the examined fractions exhibited antioxidative activities. The highest values determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method were recorded for the protein fraction of 80 000 Da mean molecular mass, while using the ABTS reagent &ndash; for the organic, non-protein fraction. Conclusions. Potato juice possesses antioxidative activity which can be enhanced by means of processing, especially, in the course of enzymatic hydrolysis. In addition, it was demonstrated that the organic nonprotein fraction of 600 Da mean molecular mass was characterised by the highest antioxidative activity...|$|E
40|$|Ice cider is {{produced}} by fermenting apple juice that has been concentrated by freezing (<b>cryoconcentration</b> or cryoextraction). Ice cider is more a sweet wine than a cider, with an intense apple flavour and sweetness, and acidity to balance the flavours. It originates from Canada, where specifications includes a pre-fermentation sugar content of not less than 30 °Brix, and a finished product with a residual sugar content of not less than 130 g/l, containing 7 - 13 % alcohol. This project aims to investigate and document some of the aspects of ice cider production process for Swedish conditions. The ambition is to start building experience and knowledge useful for ice cider production in Sweden. The scientific documentation on ice cider fermentation and biochemical properties of cryoconcentrated apple juice is very limited. In this project factors important {{for the quality of}} cider and ice wine were reviewed, and methods for producing ice cider through <b>cryoconcentration</b> and subsequent fermentation were evaluated. It was demonstrated in this project that concentrating the apple juice by cold has an equally concentrating effect on sugars, total acids and total phenolics. It was also demonstrated that the level of concentration of the juice highly influences the fermentation kinetics and output. Higher sugar level slowed down the rate of fermentation, and the amount of ethanol produced was lower. In order to produce a good ice cider, the juice needs to be sufficiently concentrated to produce the alcohol content and residual sugar level that defines the product, while not be too concentrated and place excessive hyperosmotic stress upon the yeast cells, resulting in slow and potentially stuck fermentations. The juice needs to hold a minimum of 32 °Brix, while a juice of above 42 °Brix will be very difficult to ferment. It was further demonstrated in this project that the selection of yeast strain has an effect on level of ethanol produced, and acid development during fermentation of ice cider. The level of phenolics was found to remain fairly stable across different yeast strains during fermentation. The yeast strain was also demonstrated to have a small impact on the flavour of the ice cider...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of cryotropic gelation in moderately frozen solutions of chitosan crosslinked by glutaric aldehyde is studied. Chitosan cryogels with large pores are synthesized {{at a low}} content of crosslinking agent in the reaction mixture or under conditions that do not lead to gelation at temperatures above 0 degrees C. The dependences of the yield of gel fractions, the degree of swelling of the polymer phase of cryogels, and the hydrodynamic characteristics of cryogels on the temperature of synthesis are shown to be extremal. This result {{may be explained by}} the competition between the <b>cryoconcentration</b> of reagents in the nonfrozen liquid microphase, which assists the development of a crosslinked polymer network, and such factors as an increase in the viscosity of the reaction mixture and a reduced reagent mobility, which prevent gelation. The morphology of chitosan cryogels is studied, and the character of the macroporous structure of the samples prepared at different temperatures is shown to exert a stronger effect on the hydrodynamic characteristics of a cryogel than the degree of swelling of crosslinked polymers in the walls of its macropores...|$|E
40|$|Features of cryotropic {{gelation}} in moderately frozen solutions of chitosan {{samples that}} have various molecular masses {{and that are}} covalently crosslinked with glutaraldehyde are studied. It is shown that the chain length of the macromolecular precursor, chitosan, affects the yield of the gel fraction; the swelling ability of the polymer phase of wide-pore cryogels; {{the dimensions of the}} gross capillary pores of cryogels; and, as a consequence, the hydrodynamic parameters of columns packed with a permeable continuous matrix based on the spongy gel material. The characteristics of the latter depend in a sophisticated manner on the molecular mass of the polymer used for formation of cryogels, a circumstance that is associated with competition of differently directed factors, specifically <b>cryoconcentration</b> effects, a strong increase in the viscosity of the reaction medium in the unfrozen liquid microphase, kinetic features of chain crosslinking at a high concentration of reagents, etc. Therefore, in each particular case, individual conditions for specific combination of the above-mentioned parameters of the process arise. As a result, a complex dependence corresponding is observed for the efficiency of cryostructuring of the chitosan-glutaraldehyde system and for the properties of the resulting cryogels...|$|E
40|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are able}} to self-assembly into well-defined supramolecular structures. We have previously shown that two food globular proteins with highly homologous tertiary structures and opposite electric charges, i. e. lysozyme and a-lactalbumin, interact under specific conditions of temperature and pH and generate spherical microparticles. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the stability of the lysozyme - a-lactalbumin microparticles during lyophilisation, one example of food processes. Solutions of protein microparticles without and with addition of protective molecules such as sucrose or matlodextrin were freeze-dried under conservative conditions in a pilot plant and samples were removed at each step of the process: after freezing, sublimation and desorption. The morphology and the particle size distribution of the protein microparticles were investigated by direct optical observation under a microscope and by using a Coulter counter. The freezing (and thawing) appeared to be the most damaging steps with the formation of clusters or agglomerates of microparticles. Addition of sucrose or maltodextrin sharply reduced the formation of particles agglomerates after freezing by limiting the <b>cryoconcentration</b> of the particles and trapping them in an amorphous matrix. Maltodextrin seemed to be a more efficient protective molecule than sucrose for preserving the stability of the protein microparticles during the freeze-drying process...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to determin the major stress factors during {{large-scale}} freezing of pharmaceutical protein solutions. The stability of four protein bulk solutions during several freeze-thaw cycles was studied, in order to characterise two different large scale freezing systems and identify the specific stress factors. In the third part of the study, a stable formulation for a bulk protein solution during large scale freezing could be developed. The stability of a monoclonal antibody (Daclizumab) could be obtained by the addition of disaccharides or the replacement of the existing buffer media. Results and Conclusions The KVS-System is a completely new system for freezing and thawing of therapeutic protein solution in industrial scale. The Systems provides the possibility to freeze and thaw bulk solutions very quickly. The results showed, that freezing processes in the KVS-System may be associated with an increased risk of protein loss. With an increasing volume of bulk solution cumulative stress factors were observed: A volume of 15 to 20 % of the bulk solution is freezing at a significantly higher concentration of protein, because of the <b>cryoconcentration</b> phenomena. Additionally, considerable interactions of the solution with the headspace takes place, leading in some cases to interface induced aggregation. Protein loss (precipitation) can be eliminated by optimization of the bulk formulation. The results suggest, that precipitation is a pH-dependent phenomenon. After optimization of the bulk formulation, a high stability of the protein could be demonstrated for all tested bulk substances. The stability of four proteins during freezing in the Integrated Biosystems® CryoWedge was studied. The amount of precipitated protein during freezing in the CryoWedge was significantly lower than in the KVS-System. The dimension of cryoconentration during freezing processes in the CryoWedge was reduced in comparison to the KVS-System. But within a small worste case area (0. 5 %), considerable <b>cryoconcentration</b> could be detected as well. The results from the preformulation study of a monoclonal antibody point out, that detremental effects of the buffer media, e. g. pH-shift, cannot be settled by the use of the CryoWedge. Studies on the stability of the monoclonal antibody Daclizumab showed a significant increase of aggregates after freeze-thaw-cycles in a PBS-buffer media. It could be demonstrated that the reason for the instability was the pH-shift of the freezing buffer. Replacing sodium phosphate with potassium phosphate stabilized the protein. The same effect could be detected by adding sucrose (120 mM) or trehalose (40 mM) to the PBS-buffered antibody solution. The formation of insoluble protein particles could be reduced significantly by the addition of polysorbate 80 (0. 01 % m/V), whereas the amount of soluble aggregates detected by SE-HPLC could not be affected. The results demonstrate, that a prerequisite for high protein stability is an optimized bulk formulation. Modern freezing systems can not stabilize the protein against unfavorable conditions caused by the formulation. Buffer media showing pH-shift can lead to dimerization and precepitation. Disaccharides such as trehalose and sucrose can prevent dimerization in spite of the detected pH-shift, whereas polysorbate reduced the amount of precipitated protein significantly...|$|E
40|$|The {{freezing}} of monomeric mixtures {{is known}} to concentrate solutes in a nonfrozen phase in the area surrounding the ice crystals. The concentration of such solutes {{is determined by the}} freezing temperature. Although salts or solvents do not directly react in the polymerization reaction, they do change the composition and properties of the nonfrozen phase. In this study, we investigated the influence of the addition of various salts and solvents on the structure of macroporous hydrogels formed in a semifrozen state through aqueous free-radical polymerization. The change in composition of the nonfrozen phase was studied using NMR to monitor the freezing of water, and the structural changes of the gels were observed using scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the addition of methanol or acetone caused the formation of reaction-induced phase separation polymerization due to <b>cryoconcentration,</b> which caused a significant increase of methanol or acetone in the nonfrozen phase. This resulted in a material with bimodal pore size distribution with pores of 10 - 80 μm in diameter caused by cryogelation, and with pores in the polymeric matrix with a diameter of less than 1 μm due to the reaction-induced phase separation. Addition of salts to the monomeric mixture resulted in a structure with only pores of 10 - 80 μm in diameter due to cryogelation. Increasing the amount of salts added resulted in the formation of thicker pore walls and thus a slight reduction in pore size compared to a sample with no added solute. The possibility of changing the structure and properties of the gels by adding different solutes could open up new applications for these materials, for example, chromatography applications...|$|E
40|$|High {{pressure}} is, at least, {{as effective}} as cryoprotective agents (CPAs) and are used for decreasing both homogenous nucleation and freezing temperatures. This fact {{gives rise to a}} great variety of possible cryopreservation processes under high pressure. They have not been optimized yet, since they are relatively recent and are mainly based on the pressure-temperature phase diagram of pure water. Very few phase diagrams of biological material are available under pressure. This is owing to the lack of suitable equipment and to the difficulties encountered in carrying out the measurements. Different aqueous solutions of salt and CPAs as biological models are studied in the range of 0 °C down to- 35 °C, 0. 1 up to 250 MPa, and 0 - 20 % w/w total solute concentration. The phase transition curves of glycerol and of sodium chloride with either glycerol or sucrose in aqueous solutions are determined in a high hydrostatic pressure vessel. The experimental phase diagrams of binary solutions were well described by a third-degree polynomial equation. It was also shown that Robinson and Stokes' equation at high pressure succeeds in predicting the phase diagrams of both binary and ternary solutions. The solute <b>cryoconcentration</b> and the ice content were calculated as a function of temperature and pressure conditions during the freezing of a binary solution. This information should provide a basis upon which high-pressure cryopreservation processes may be performed and the damages derived from ice formation evaluated. © 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

40|$|This is {{a review}} {{discussing}} {{the production and}} properties of cryogels (from the Greek κριoσ (kryos) meaning frost or ice), immobilization of ligands in cryogels {{and the application of}} affinity cryogels in bioseparation. Cryotropic gel formation proceeds in a non-frozen liquid microphase existing in the macroscopically frozen sample. Due to the <b>cryoconcentration</b> of gel precursors in the non-frozen liquid microphase, cryogelation is characterised by a decrease in the critical concentration of gelation and an increase in gelation rates compared with traditional gelation at temperatures above freezing point. Cryogels can be obtained through the formation of both physically and covalently cross-linked heterogeneous polymer networks. Interconnected systems of macropores and sponge-like morphology are typical for cryogels, allowing unhindered diffusion of solutes of practically any size. Most of the water present in spongy cryogels is capillary bound and can be removed mechanically by squeezing. The properties of cryogels can be regulated by the temperature of cryogelation, the time the sample is kept in a frozen state and freezing/thawing rates, {{by the nature of the}} solvent and by the use of soluble and insoluble additives. The unique macroporous morphology of cryogels, in combination with osmotic, chemical and mechanical stability, makes them attractive matrices for chromatography of large entities such as protein aggregates, membrane fragments, viruses, cell organells and even whole cells. Special attention is given to immunosorption of viruses on cryogel-based sorbents. As chromatographic materials, cryogels can be used both in bead form and as spongy cylindrical blocks (monoliths) synthesized inside the chromatographic column. The macroporous nature of cryogels is also advantageous for their application as matrices in the immobilization of biocatalysts operating in both aqueous and organic solvents. New potential applications of cryogels are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The lack of safe, {{clean water}} is {{strongly}} linked to poverty, underdevelopment and poor health. Water is needed {{not only to}} sustain life, but to produce food and in industrial processes. Anthropogenic pollution and natural events can jeopardize access to safe water. Inorganic pollutants or toxic metal ions such as arsenic and cadmium are of special concern since these are persistent and accumulate in nature. Contaminated water used for direct consumption or for irrigation of crops can thus lead to direct and indirect exposure to humans to these metals. To improve access to safe water, treatment must be developed to remove even low concentrations of toxic metal ions. Adsorption is a suitable technique. In this work, adsorbents were developed for various kinds of water sources; dinking water, wastewater, industrial water and leachate from a biogas process, all of which contained metal ions, such as As or Cd, at low concentrations. The adsorbents developed {{were based on a}} polymer cryogels, produced via <b>cryoconcentration.</b> Cryogels have a highly interconnected and porous structure, making them suitable for water treatment. The cryogels evaluated in this thesis were all based on the polymer polyacrylamide (pAAm). In the first study, a pAAm cryogel was chemically modified with chelating functionalities suitable for the removal of heavy metals (i. e. Cu 2 +, Zn 2 +, Pb 2 + and Ni 2). A rational design was suggested, involving preparation of the polymer inside plastic carriers to increase the mechanical stability of the material. Another strategy using particles was explored by embedding either nanoparticles (NPs) or molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) in pAAm-cryogels. The ability of Al 2 O 3 NPs or MIPs in cryogels (called Alu-cryo and MIP-cryo, respectively), to remove As(V) was investigated. Both Alu-cryo and MIP-cryo exhibited adsorption capacities similar to those when the respective particles were applied in suspension. MIP-cryo showed higher selectivity but lower adsorption capacity than Alu-cryo. To improve the removal of As(III) without any pretreatment, co-precipitated Fe-Al hydrous oxides were prepared and embedded in cryogels. As(III) could be removed from smelting wastewater in flow-through mode, reducing the concentration to European industrial emission standards. The removal of Cd 2 + from leachate resulting from the anaerobic digestion of seaweed was studied using hydrothermally modified TiO 2 embedded in cryogels. This cryogel was shown to be successful in removing Cd 2 + when tested in flow-through mode, and high adsorption capacities were obtained. Toxicity and particle leakage were studied in NP-embedded cryogels. Although no evidence of particle leaking was found, toxicity resulted from the leakage of the monomer acrylamide from the cryogel. The findings of this work show that cryogel-based adsorbents have potential in water treatment, due to their broad range of applications and the flexibility of the material. New and improved methods of particle immobilization in cryogels should be investigated, and pAAm should be replaced by non-toxic alternatives. Making cryogel materials with high adsorption capacities, which can be regenerated, can reduce the cost of water treatment. It is also important that novel technology meets environmental safety requirements to ensure the supply of safe water...|$|E
