The sensor has a piezoelectric ceramic crystal (PCC) that sends an ultrasonic pulse into an ice layer and detects an echo returning from the ice; the time elapsed in the pulse-echo round trip provides a basis for calculating ice thickness. Simmonds offers an alternative system with two PCCs, one a transmitter {{and the other a}} receiver for picking up the return echo. This technique offers detection of ice at much smaller thickness values, but at the cost of some ability to detect thicker ice. Among the advantages of the system are the small size of the sensor, which allows its placement in areas previously inaccessible. Other sensor advantages include high accuracy and insensitivity to salt spray, <b>fog,</b> <b>chemicals</b> and abrasion.

40|$|Chemical {{detectors}} (“sensors”) usually {{consist of}} a two-dimensional array of receptors exposed to the solution to be tested, from whose output the bulk solution concentration of the analyte of interest can be determined. Both input and output—the number of analyte particles striking the array in a given interval of time, and the number captured—are countable events. The gain is the quotient of these two numbers, and the detectivity the quotient of their fluctuations. The gain and detectivity provide a universal framework for comparing different types of sensors, and in which the desirable properties of sensors, e. g. their ability to detect very weak signals (“sensitivity”), and to detect the analyte {{in the presence of}} a large excess of other molecules (“selectivity”), can be related to various physico-chemical parameters such as the packing density and size of receptors, and their affinity for the analyte. Analyte multivalence, although formally a source of inefficiency, is very useful for making the sensor more resistant to spurious chemical noise. An important result is that <b>chemical</b> <b>fog</b> engendered by a huge excess of nonspecifically binding particles has no effect on the detectivity, provided that the nonspecific interaction is reversible...|$|E

Within {{the scope of the}} project, for the first time, a detailed radiation fog model has been developed, which describes the interactions between microphysics, chemistry, and vegetation. The results show a significant impact of vegetation on the fog development. This result is of interest for regional forecast models, especially for the model PAFOG that is based on MIFOG. CHEMIFOG_V allows quantitative and qualitative studies on deposition, especially regarding the chemical composition of the deposit, and therefore represents an important tool for both regional atmospheric as well as forest science. Due to the interaction with vegetation radiation fog events lead to a significant reduction of the aerosol particle and trace gas concentrations in the planetary boundary layer. Leaf surface water on the surfaces of the vegetation elements leads to a significant change in the dry deposition rates of soluble trace gases. Especially chemical reactions in the leaf surface water have significant impact on size and direction of deposition fluxes. Physical and chemical processes within a forest lead to a modification of the emissions of NO and isoprene on the canopy scale compared to the primary emissions. Aqueous phase concentration of sulphate shows a size dependence as well as a significant temporal and spatial variability during a radiation fog event. (orig.) Also LPS-no.

40|$|The stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.), or dog fly, {{as it is}} {{commonly}} called in northwest Florida, has been a serious nuisance in that area for many years. Blakeslee (1945) found that DDT gave effective control when it was applied as a residual spray to larval breeding areas in marine grass deposits. However, in recent years this method has not provided the degree of control necessary. As a result, large numbers of adult flies have at times seriously affected the tourist industry of northwest Florida.

After analyzing the data, statistical evaluation was made. Particles were put into categories according to their shapes on spherical and not spherical. Typical particles like Al, Si, K, Fe or Ca-rich particles were determined. Focus was also to particles with rarely represented elements like Ni, Au, Pb, Cu, Zr and Ba.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the Winter Fog Experiment (WIFEX) over the Indo-Gangetic Plains of India are to develop better now-casting and forecasting of winter fog on various time-and spatial scales. Maximum fog occurrence over northwest India is about 48 days (visibility < 1000 m) per year, and it occurs mostly during the December-February time-period. The physical and <b>chemical</b> characteristics of <b>fog,</b> meteorological factors responsible for its genesis, sustenance, intensity and dissipation are poorly understood. Improved understanding on the above aspects is required to develop reliable forecasting models and observational techniques for accurate prediction of the fog events. Extensive sets of comprehensive ground-based instrumentation were deployed at the Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi. Major in situ sensors were deployed to measure surface micrometeorological conditions, radiation balance, turbulence, thermodynamical structure of the surface layer, fog droplet and aerosol microphysics, aerosol optical properties, and aerosol and fog water chemistry to describe the complete environmental conditions under which fog develops.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a selective overview of natural fogs {{in terms of}} fog types, forms and states of occurrence, physical, micro-physical, chemical and dynamic properties, basic characterizing parameters, etc. In focus are related achievements and contributions reported mainly {{during the last decade}} and a half, as a result of both laboratory studies and field observations. Processes of homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation are analyzed in the aspects of condensation, nuclei diversity and specifics, as related to the activation, growth and deposition of fog droplets. The effect is highlighted of the water vapor’s partial pressure on the surface tension of the liquid water–air interface and the freezing point of the water droplets. Some problems and aspects of fog modeling, parameterization, and forecasting are outlined and discussed on the examples of newly developed relevant 1 D/ 3 D theoretical models. Important issues of fog impacts on the air quality, ecosystems, water basins, societal life, and human health are also addressed and discussed, particularly in cases of anthropogenically modified (<b>chemical,</b> radioactive, etc.) <b>fogs.</b> In view of reducing the possible negative effects of fogs, conclusions are drawn concerning the new demands and challenges to fog characterization imposed by the changing natural and social environment and the needs for new data on and approaches to more adequate observations of fog-related events...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} composition of ambient fogwater was studied at several {{urban and rural}} sites in California and at a site in Albany, NY, using a rotating arm collector (accompanying paper by Jacob et al.). The ionic concentrations observed were generally much higher than those commonly found in precipitation. In the Los Angeles basin and the San Joaquin Valley of California extremely high acidities were found. Fog sampled in rural areas frequently had high ionic concentrations, indicating long-range pollutant transport. Low stratus clouds in the Los Angeles basin {{were found to be}} chemically similar to ground-level fogs. At some California sites the aerosol and gas-phase chemistry were monitored prior to fog formation and after fog evaporation. From these measurements it appears that fog droplets are efficient scavengers of ambient aerosol particles and gases. At Albany data was available on the liquid water content, droplet microphysics and boundary layer meteorological parameters; it is found that condensation and evaporation of water vapor on preexisting nuclei are the dominant processes controlling the <b>chemical</b> composition of <b>fog</b> droplets. Absorption of SO_ 2 followed by aqueous-phase oxidation to sulfate, with the concomitant production f acidity, is also expected to contribute to observed concentrations.

40|$|International audienceHaze episodes often hit urban {{cities in}} China recently. Here, we present several {{continuous}} haze episodes with extremely high PM 2. 5 levels that occurred over several weeks in early 2013 and extended across {{most parts of}} the northern and eastern China—far exceeding the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region. Particularly, the haze episode covered ~ 1 million km 2 on January 14, 2013 and the daily averaged PM 2. 5 concentration exceeded 360 μg m− 3 in Ji'nan. The observed maximum hourly PM 2. 5 concentration in urban Ji'nan reached 701 μg m− 3 at 7 : 00 am (local time) in January 30. During these haze episodes, several fog events happened and the concurrent fog water was found to be seriously polluted. For the fog water collected in Ji'nan from 10 : 00 pm in January 14 to 11 : 00 am in January 15, sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium were the major ions with concentrations of 1. 54 × 106, 8. 98 × 105, and 1. 75 × 106 μeq L− 1, respectively, leading to a low in-situ pH of 3. 30. The sulfate content in the fog sample was more than 544 times as high as those observed in other areas. With examination of the simultaneously observed data on PM 2. 5 and its <b>chemical</b> composition, the <b>fog</b> played a role in scavenging and removing fine particles from the atmosphere during haze episodes and thus was seriously contaminated.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a summary of}} our {{findings}} from a four-year study of the <b>chemical</b> composition of <b>fog</b> and cloud water in California. Fog water was sampled {{at a number of}} sites with a rotating arm collector, which was developed in our laboratory and collects representative samples. Field investigations in the Los Angeles basin, the San Gabriel Mountains, and the San Joaquin Valley revealed very high ionic concentrations in polluted fogs, often coupled with very high acidities. Fogs and stratus clouds in the Los Angeles basin typically had pH values ranging from 2 to 4. Acidities were not as high in the San Joaquin Valley, mostly because of scavenging by the fogs of ammonia from agricultural sources. We showed that fogwater deposits efficiently on surfaces during fog events; this deposition was observed to be an important pollutant sink during stagnation episodes in the San Joaquin Valley, {{but at the same time}} it could be an important source of acid input to surfaces in some areas. Insight into the oxidation of S(IV) to S(VI), which is the major aqueous-phase source of acidity, was gained from field data, laboratory studies, and model development. Kinetic experiments showed that H_ 2 O_ 2 was an important oxidant at low pH, and we predicted that metal-catalyzed autoxidation could also be an important source of sulfate. However, we found that the extreme acidities observed in fogs (below pH 3) require condensation on preexistent acidic nuclei and scavenging of gaseous nitric acid. Stabilization of S(IV) in the fog was observed, and this was attributed to the formation of S(IV) -aldehyde adduct...|$|R
40|$|A Lagrangian {{radiation}} fog model {{is applied to}} a fog event at Summit, Greenland. The model simulates the formation and dissipation of fog. Included in the model are detailed gas and aqueous phase chemistry, and deposition of <b>chemical</b> species with <b>fog</b> droplets. Model predictions of the gas phase concentrations of H 2 O 2, HCOOH, SO 2, and HNO 3 {{as well as the}} fog fluxes of S(VI), N(V), H 2 O 2, and water are compared with measurements. The predicted fluxes of S(VI), N(V), H 2 O 2, and fog water generally agree with measured values. Model results show that heterogeneous SO 2 oxidation contributes to approximately 40 % of the flux of S(VI) for the modeled fog event, with the other 60 % coming from preexisting sulfate aerosol. The deposition of N(V) with fog includes contributions from HNO 3 and NO 2 initially present in the air mass. HNO 3 directly partitions into the aqueous phase to create N(V), and NO 2 forms N(V) through reaction with OH and the nighttime chemistry set of reactions which involves N 2 O 5 and water vapor. PAN contributes to N(V) by gas phase decomposition to NO 2, and also by direct aqueous phase decomposition. The quantitative contributions from each path are uncertain since direct measurements of PAN and NO 2 are not available for the fog event. The relative contributions are discussed based on realistic ranges of atmospheric concentrations. Model results suggest that in addition to the aqueous phase partitioning of the initial HNO 3 present in the air mass, the gas phase decomposition of PAN and subsequent reactions of NO 2 with OH as well as nighttime nitrate chemistry may play significant roles in depositing N(V) with fog. If a quasi-liquid layer exists on snow crystals, {{it is possible that the}} reactions taking place in fog droplets also occur to some extent in clouds as well as at the snow surface...|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanistic}} {{air quality}} model is developed {{that represents the}} atmospheric aerosol as a source-oriented external mixture of particles. A source-oriented external mixture is created when particles are released to the atmosphere from sources having distinctly different particle size and composition distributions. These particles evolve separately in the atmosphere while interacting with a common gas phase distribution of pollutants. The model represents advection, turbulent diffusion, gas-phase photochemistry, diffusion of reactants and products {{to and from the}} particles, aerosol thermodynamics, heterogeneous <b>chemical</b> reactions within <b>fogs,</b> and dry deposition. Calculations track individual particles from specific sources and then quantify the contribution which each source makes to the size and composition distribution of ambient suspended particulate matter at downwind receptor sites. Model results that simulate the August 28, 1987, episode of the Southern California Air Quality Study (SCAQS) experiments show that hygroscopic background particles advected into the Los Angeles area are transformed significantly by secondary chemical reactions in the urban atmosphere in a way that shapes the largest peak in the ambient fine particle (PM 2. 5) size distribution. Source contributions from more than 50 separate types of primary particle emissions sources also are revealed through a new technique for displaying model outputs. The air quality model is used to calculate the effects that alternative specific emissions control measures would have on air quality. Calculations show that a control plan which combines nearly all available emissions reduction techniques for gas- and particle-phase pollutants could have cut atmospheric fine particle (PM 2. 5) concentrations approximately in half at Claremont, CA, on August 28, 1987, {{in the absence of any}} other changes. Source tests are conducted to measure the size and chemical composition distribution of particles released from diesel vehicles, catalyst-equipped gasoline-powered vehicles, non-catalyst-equipped gasoline vehicles, meat cooking, wood burning, and cigarette smoke. These improved emissions data are combined with the air quality model, which then is used to determine the source origin of particulate matter in the Southern California atmosphere during field experiments conducted for purposes of model evaluation in September, 1996...|$|R

Concentrations in fogwater were also affected by the physical processes of condensation and evaporation. Light, dissipating fogs routinely showed the highest concentrations. The chemistry of urban fog has been modelled using a hybrid kinetic and equilibrium computer code.
