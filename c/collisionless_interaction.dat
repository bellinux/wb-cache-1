40|$|The earth's {{magnetosphere}} {{is caused}} by the interaction between the flowing solar wind and the earth's magnetic dipole, with the distorted magnetic field in the outer parts of the magnetosphere due to the current systems resulting from this interaction. It is surprising that even the conceptually simple problem of the <b>collisionless</b> <b>interaction</b> of a flowing plasma with a dipole magnetic field has not been solved. A kinetic approach is essential if one is {{to take into account the}} dispersion of particles with different energies and pitch angles and the fact that particles on different trajectories have different histories and may come from different sources. Solving the interaction problem involves finding the various types of possible trajectories, populating them with particles appropriately, and then treating the electric and magnetic fields self-consistently with the resulting particle densities and currents. This approach is illustrated by formulating a procedure for solving the <b>collisionless</b> <b>interaction</b> problem on open field lines in the case of a slowly flowing magnetized plasma interacting with a magnetic dipole...|$|E
40|$|The Kuiper belt is a disk of icy {{bodies that}} orbit the Sun beyond Neptune; the largest known members are Pluto and its {{companion}} Charon. A few per cent of Kuiper-belt bodies {{have recently been}} found to be binaries with wide separations and mass ratios of the order of unity. Collisions were too infrequent to account for the observed number of binaries, implying that these binaries formed through <b>collisionless</b> <b>interactions</b> mediated by gravity. These interactions are likely to have been most effective during the period of runaway accretion, early in the Solar System's history. Here we show that a transient binary forms when two large bodies penetrate one another's Hill sphere (the region where their mutual forces are larger than the tidal force of the Sun). The loss of energy needed to stabilize the binary orbit can then occur either through dynamical friction from surrounding small bodies, or through the gravitational scattering of a third large body. Our estimates slightly favour the former mechanism. We predict that five per cent of Kuiper-belt objects are binaries with apparent separations greater than 0. 2 arcsec, and that most are in tighter binaries or systems of higher multiplicity...|$|R

30|$|The {{chemistry}} is {{performed on the}} particles within the spherical grid. New particles are created if the production rate exceeds the loss rates within each spherical cell. Previously existing particles have their density decreased as recombination occurs. These spherical grids (there are several for each ionospheric species) also are {{used to calculate the}} ion-neutral drag and to apply the gravity terms as well. What makes this particularly effective is that particle locations can be easily found on either grid. Therefore, ionospheric particles that are picked up will naturally transition out of the region of chemistry and collisions into the region of pure <b>collisionless</b> electromagnetic <b>interactions.</b> Meanwhile, particles still at lower altitudes feel the electromagnetic fields from the Cartesian grid as well as the collisional forces.|$|R

It is shown that the plasma cloud expands excluding the ambient magnetic field and the background plasma to form a diamagnetic cavity which is accompanied by the generation of a collisionless shock wave.

We attempt to constraint the GC scenario as the cause of Uranus' obliquity as well as on the mechanisms able to give origin to the Uranian irregulars. Different capture mechanisms for irregulars operate at different stages on the giant planets formation process. The mechanisms able to capture the uranian irregulars before and after the GC are analysed. Assuming that they were captured before the GC, we calculate the orbital transfer of the nine irregulars by the impulse imparted by the GC. If their orbital transfer results dynamically implausible, they should have originated after the GC. We investigate and discuss the dissipative mechanisms able to operate later. In particular Prospero could not exist at the time of the GC. Different capture mechanisms for Prospero after the GC are investigated. Gas drag by Uranus'envelope and pull-down capture are not plausible mechanisms. Capture of Prospero through a <b>collisionless</b> <b>interaction</b> seems to be difficult. The GC itself provides a mechanism of permanent capture. However, the capture of Prospero by the GC is a low probable event. Catastrophic collisions could be a possible mechanism for the birth of Prospero and the other irregulars after the GC. Orbital and physical clusterings should then be expected. Either Prospero had to originate after the GC or the GC did not occur. In the former case, the mechanism for the origin of Prospero after the GC remains an open question.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that magnetized electron clouds can diagnose picoamp ion currents (or equivalent neutralized plasma flows) on a kHz time scale. This {{could be used}} to measure the dynamics of neutral plasma losses to the walls, e. g., along divertor field lines. In essence, a current passing through an electron cloud in a Penning trap transfers angular momentum to the cloud, driving an easily measured orbital "diocotron" instability (from ion currents) or orbital damping (from electron currents). With neutralized plasma flows, the predominant effect is from the lower velocity (i. e., higher density) charge species.

40|$|Martinez-Sanchez and Sanmartin [1997] {{showed that}} a bare {{conducting}} tether {{can be used as}} a source of an energetic electron beam. Interacting with the E region atmosphere, the beam should produce airglow thus making possible to deduce the neutral density on a continuous basis. Fujii et al. [2005] suggested that this idea be tested in a specially-designed sounding rocket experiment. We show that <b>collisionless</b> beam-plasma <b>interactions</b> (BPI) complement direct impact, leading to appreciable green-line (557. 7 nm) emissions in the F region. In the E region, BPI develops near the entry in the valley, resulting in a narrow layer of strongly-elevated and airglow. Besides, neutralizing electric currents carried by ionospheric electrons in the valley can become unstable or even insufficient to compensate the beam current. Developing plasma waves inhibit neutralizing currents. In the extreme case, the beam might be locked in the valley (the 'virtual cathode'). In addition to optical observations, these effects can also be observed by radiophysical means...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical plasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks). The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic {{with respect to the}} mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the "inertial range" above the ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations, which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated with the Alfvenic component. In the "dissipation range" between the ion and electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave (KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by <b>collisionless</b> wave-particle <b>interaction</b> at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling relations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical applications are discussed in detail. Comment: aastex using emulateapj, 65 pages, 10 figures; replaced to match published versio...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we {{establish}} the linear stability of an electron equilibrium for an electrostatic and <b>collisionless</b> plasma in <b>interaction</b> with a wall. The equilibrium we focus on, is called in plasma physics, a Debye sheath. Specifically, we consider a two species (ions and electrons) Vlasov-Poisson-Ampère {{system in a}} bounded and one dimensional geometry. The interaction between the plasma and the wall is modeled by original boundary conditions : On the one hand, ions are absorbed by the wall while electrons are partially re-emited. On the other hand, the electric field at the wall is induced by the accumulation of charged particles at the wall. These boundary conditions ensure the compatibility with the Maxwell-Ampère equation. A global existence, uniqueness and stability result for the linearized system is proven. The main difficulty {{lies in the fact}} that (due to the boundaries) the equilibrium is a discontinuous function of the particle energy, which in the end results in a linearized system that contains a degenerate (at the border) transport equation...|$|R
40|$|It {{appears that}} at least several percent of large Kuiper belt objects are members of wide binaries. Physical {{collisions}} are too infrequent to account for their formation. <b>Collisionless</b> gravitational <b>interactions</b> are more promising. These provide two channels for binary formation. In each, the initial step is {{the formation of a}} transient binary when two large bodies penetrate each other's Hill spheres. Stabilization of a transient binary requires that it lose energy. Either dynamical friction due to small bodies or the scattering of a third large body can be responsible. Our estimates favor the former, albeit by a small margin. We predict that most objects of size comparable to those currently observed in the Kuiper belt are members of multiple systems. More specifically, we derive the probability that a large body is a member of a binary with semi-major axis of order a. The probability depends upon sigma, the total surface density, Sigma, the surface density of large bodies having radius R, and theta= 10 ^- 4, the angle subtended by the solar radius as seen from the Kuiper belt. For (sigma/Sigma) R<a< R/theta, the probability is just (Sigma/rho R) theta^- 2, the optical depth of the large bodies divided by the solid angle subtended by the Sun. For R<a<r_u=(sigma/Sigma) R, it varies inversely with semimajor axis and reaches (sigma/rho R) theta^- 2 at a=R. Based on current surveys of the Kuiper belt, we estimate Sigma/rho= 3 10 ^- 4 cm and R= 100 km. We obtain sigma/rho= 0. 3 cm by extrapolating the surface density deduced for the minimum mass solar nebula. Rough predictions are: outside of the critical separation r_u/a_odot= 3 '', the binary probability is 0. 3 %; at separations of 0. 2 '', comparable to current resolving capabilities, it reaches 5 %, in agreement with results from the HST binary survey by Brown...|$|R
