40|$|Nowadays, {{the search}} for {{healthier}} dietary food choices has increased the demand for fresh and nutritive products. Several epidemiological studies indicate that fruits, vegetables and less processed food ensure a higher protection against diseases caused by oxidative stress. Citrus juices attract attention {{as a result of}} their health-related properties, due to the presence of natural antioxidants. Orange juice, in particular, is one of the most consumed juices worldwide and it is an important source of flavonoids and phenolic compounds. As a result of the development of new technologies and the improvement of traditional industrial processing, there is a wide range of new commercial juices promoted by strong marketing strategies. In fact, it is important to evaluate whether these processed products maintain similar properties to a freshly squeezed juice. The main objective of the present work was to evaluate the antioxidant activity of six samples of orange juice: one nectar, three <b>concentrated</b> <b>juices,</b> and two freshly squeezed juices (filtrated and non-filtrated). The oranges and orange juices were acquired in local supermarkets, and the antioxidant activity was determined comparing three different methods: 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH●), Folin-Ciocalteu method (applied to determine total phenolics, using gallic acid as standard) and total flavonoids assay (using epicatechin as standard). All the analyses were performed at least in duplicate. For DDPH● assay, the EC 50 value (inversely proportional to antioxidant activity) was higher for the nectar (13. 8 ± 0. 33 mg/mL), followed by freshly squeezed juices (12. 6 ± 0. 59 and 12. 3 ± 0. 22 mg/mL, filtrated and non-filtrated, respectively) and concentrated juice (9. 01 ± 0. 03 mg/mL). The highest value for total phenolics was found in <b>concentrated</b> <b>juices</b> (0. 208 ± 0. 04 mg/mL), whereas the lowest corresponds to the orange nectar (0. 134 ± 0. 00 mg/mL). With respect to total flavonoids content, the values varied between 0. 099 ± 0. 00 and 0. 158 ± 0. 01 mg/mL, for nectar and <b>concentrated</b> <b>juices,</b> respectively. Our results indicated that orange juice can be considered a good source of natural antioxidants, including flavonoids and phenolic compounds. The methods for antioxidant activity evaluation showed that orange nectar had the lowest antioxidant capacity, whereas the <b>concentrated</b> <b>juices</b> presented the highest. There is no evidence that filtration of the freshly squeezed juice produced considerable variations. Although the industrial processing of orange juice may cause losses of vitamin C, it is a common practice of food industry to add L-ascorbic acid at the end of the processing. In fact, commercial <b>concentrated</b> <b>juices</b> revealed higher values of antioxidant activity, flavonoids and phenolic compounds, than the freshly squeezed juices.

Consultation of historical and recent documentation on ingredients and processing have been carried out; Information on paste and present uses and recipes has been collected [...] Within each category of product (for direct consumption or seasoning; liquid or solid; sweet or sour) similar processing systems and raw material are used in the Black sea Countries and in Italy. In both areas the traditional ways of fruit preservation are: - the reduction of water content (dried fruits, <b>concentrated</b> <b>juices,</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>juices</b> and pulps, dried pulps; - addition of sugar or salt; - fermentation (alcoholic or other). Correspondences between the two areas for products, ingredients and systems may be individuated: pekmez and saba are <b>concentrated</b> <b>juices</b> obtained after long cooking of fruits and grapes (Black sea area) and grapes (Italy); pelamushi are made with flour mixed to cooked juice of grape or other fruits) similarly to ‘sughi’ (grape must cooked with flour), lekvar and savor or savurett are produced boiling for hours fruit juice with fruit slices, isrimi (Georgia) and agresto (Italy) are verjuices obtained from unripe grapes and are generally used as a substitutes of vinegar, Factors of differentiation among products are area of production, species used and needs of the local communities.

50|$|Currently, {{reverse osmosis}} and vacuum-evaporation {{technologies}} {{are used to}} <b>concentrate</b> <b>juices</b> and other food liquids. In commercial operations, <b>juice</b> is normally <b>concentrated</b> by evaporation. Since 1962, the Thermally Accelerated Short Time Evaporator (TASTE) has been widely used. TASTE evaporators are efficient, sanitary, easy to clean, of high capacity, simple to operate, and of relatively low cost. On the other hand, there is some heat damage to the product caused by the high-temperature steam treatment. This treatment results in product quality and aroma losses. Because of the low value of the film coefficient between steam and treated juice, heat transfer between them is very inefficient. It leads to the cumbersome construction of TASTE plants. The alternative is to <b>concentrate</b> <b>juice</b> and food liquid by a cooling and freezing process. In this case crystals of pure water are removed from the juice, wine, or beer by crystallization. The aroma, color, and flavor remain in the concentrated medium. The quality of freeze-concentrated products cannot be achieved by any other technology. The main advantages in comparison with other freezing techniques are low energy expenditure and the possibility to tune {{the rate of the}} phase change from liquid to solid ice, which in turn increases the production of pure water ice crystals and simplifies the separation of <b>concentrated</b> <b>juice</b> or food liquid and ice crystals.|$|R

The initial stage of these diseases, early diagnosis and treatment are the main objectives of current researches. According to Lithuanian Health Information Centre {{morbidity and mortality}} due to these diseases in Lithuania exceed average of European Union. The oxidative stress occurs in cells as a result of normal physiological processes and environmental interactions, and the complex antioxidant defense system are of particular importance in protecting biological systems against oxidative damage by free radicals. Recently polyphenols and anthocyanins containing foods and preparations have attracted attention due to their health promoting benefits. Anthocyanins make one of the main groups of flavonoids, and represent polyphenolic compounds, that are found in vegetables and fruits, particularly in berries. An important effect of anthocyanins is the scavenging of oxygen-derived free radicals. They can interfere with few different free radical-producing systems, and can increase the function of the endogenous antioxidants. The aim of the research is to choose sources for the products with antioxidant activity from plants cultivated in Lithuania, evaluate quality and antioxidant activity of black currant, red currant and chokeberry products, to develop and evaluate technologies of phytopharmaceuticals with antioxidant activity. Innovation and practical significance of the research. Antioxidant activity of Lithuanian black currant, red currant and chokeberry berries <b>concentrated</b> <b>juices</b> was evaluated for the first time. There were applied DPPH and ABTS methods for these products. These results will bring antioxidant activity data performed by world scientists up-to-date. Dry product from Lithuanian black currant berries juices was made by spry draying. Production of tablets with black currant polyphenols (and athocyanins) was made {{for the first time in}} Lithuania. Two products with antioxidant activity were prepared for industry: tablets with standardized extract of black currant and complex composition tablets with standardized extract of black currant and vitamin premix (vitamins E, C and β-carotene). Experimental series of tablets was produced, quality and stability was evaluated. Composition of tablet was optimized by experimental design. Scientific technological documentation for tablets with standardized extract of black currant and complex composition tablets with standardized extract of black currant and vitamin premix was prepared. Results The stability of polyphenols and anthocyanins is significantly influenced by storage conditions of black currant and chokeberry <b>concentrated</b> <b>juices.</b> It is recommended to store black currant and chokeberry <b>concentrated</b> <b>juices</b> at low temperatures and the time should be possibly short till it is processed to more stable products. The results demonstrated insufficient stability of juice concentrates, and impossibility of application of long lasting drying processes in black currant and chokeberry berries dry products manufacturing. Fast and efficient drying methods for liquid products should be applied to preserve qualitative and quantitative composition and their antioxidant activity. Only complex approach to quality evaluation of natural origin products presents reliable basis for establishment of product value. Determined contents of polyphenols and anthocyanins in black currant product were higher and it possessed stronger antioxidant activity if compared to chokeberry. Therefore black currant concentrated juice was chosen for further processing and development of solid dosage form possessing antioxidant activity. Spray drying procedure was performed in Medical University of Gdansk, department of Pharmaceutical technology (Poland). Spry drier „ANHYDRO“ type LAB – S 1 (Denmark) was used for this procedure. Black currant juice concentrate was diluted with water (1 : 1) and 10 % of amorphous silica was admixed to the water-diluted concentrate. The resulting powder was dry and non-sticky. Other used product was black currant extract standardized 7 % anthocyanins. Conclusions Researches were performed at 2001 - 2005. During this period there were analyzed and evaluated black currant (Ribes nigrum L.), chokeberry (Chokeberry melanocarpa (Michx.) Elliott) and red currant (Ribes rubrum L.) berries <b>concentrated</b> <b>juices</b> as raw material for production of preparations with antioxidant activity. There were produced tablets with spry dried black currant berries juices; tablets with black currant extract standardized 7 % anthocyanins; and tablets with standardized (7 % anthocyanins) black currant extract and vitamin (E, C, β-carotene) mixture. Quality and stability of these tablets were evaluated. It can be concluded: 1. Black currant extract was chosen for production of antioxidant preparations. Results showed higher amount of polyphenols 3786, 25 ± 180 mg/l GAE (p= 0, 0193) and antioxidant activity 78, 49 ± 3, 9 % (p= 0, 0003) of black currant juices then in chokeberry juices. Results showed low antioxidant activity, small amounts polyphenols and anthocyanins of red currant juices. Therefore red currant analysis was not continued. 2. Chromatographic and spectroscopic methods were applied for qualitative and quantitative analysis; Acceptability of these methods was validated for analysis of raw material and stability of tablets. 3. Polyphenols, anthocyanins and antioxidant activity significantly decreased after storage at 20 ± 0, 5 and 40 ± 0, 5 ºC temperatures. Best stability was determinated at 2 ± 0, 5 ºC temperature (p< 0, 001). It is recommended to store black currant and chokeberry <b>concentrated</b> <b>juices</b> at low temperatures and the time should be possibly short till it is processed to more stable products. 4. Dependence of antioxidant activity on anthocyanin amount was determinated (r= 0, 76). Anthocyanins in black currant juices were more stabile (p= 0, 0062) then in chokeberry juices. 5. Spray drying was applied for black currant juices, conditions of drying were determinated. Spry dried product is appropriate for production of solid dosage forms due to good technological properties. 6. Tablets with dry concentrate of black currant juices were produced, appropriate excipients were chosen for good quality tablet production by direct pressing. Analysis confirmed quality and stability of tablets with dry concentrate of black currant juices. 7. Two technologies of tablets with standardized black currant extract, standardized black currant extract and vitamin mixture (vitamins E, C and β-carotene) were studied as potential antioxidant phytopharmaceuticals. Tablets technology of these two compositions was established, quality and stability were evaluated. Tablet composition with standardized black currant extract was optimized by orthogonal full factorial design model. Optimal mounts of excipients were determinated: 18, 0 mg of silica, colloidal anhydrous, 3, 5 mg of magnesium stearate and 278, 5 mg of microcrystalline cellulose. Results satisfied Europe pharmacopeias requirements for tablet quality. 8. Scientific technological documentation was prepared for tablets with standardized black currant extract and vitamin premix (vitamins E, C and β-carotene) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the infl uence of cultivar and industrial processing on total polyphenols, anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamic acids and antioxidant activity in concentrated sour cherry (Prunus cerasus L., cvs. Marasca and Oblačinska) juices. Samples were collected during four processing steps: from fresh fruit prior to processing, then from pressed, fi ltered and <b>concentrated</b> <b>juices.</b> The content of total phenols was the same in both cultivars, but antioxidant activity (Oblačinska>Marasca) and total monomeric anthocyanins (Marasca>Oblačinska) diff ered. All processing steps significantly influenced the content of total phenols, total monomeric anthocyanins and antioxidant activity. In all samples four major anthocyanins were identifi ed by HPLC with UV/VIS PDA detector, listed in the descending order based on their abundance: cyanidin- 3 -glucosylrutinoside, cyanidin- 3 -rutinoside, cyanidin- 3 -sophoroside and cyanidin- 3 -glucoside. Marasca cv. contained more total anthocyanins, and contents of cyanidin- 3 -sophoroside and cyanidin- 3 -glucosylrutinoside. The content of total hydroxycinnamic acids was also higher in Marasca than Oblačinska cv. Aft er processing, the concentration of all identifi ed anthocyanins increased in both cultivars. Majority of the highest values of polyphenols were detected in the juice aft er pressing. The content of polyphenols and their antioxidant activity were considerably stable during industrial processing to concentrated juice. Although Marasca had higher polyphenolic content than Oblačinska, both cultivars showed promising industrial potential for processing to concentrated juice...|$|E
