60|$|Now, {{see what}} happens. These two platinum-plates {{are the two}} ends (or I will make them so immediately) of this apparatus; and I am about {{to put them in}} contact with that {{solution}} just as we did a moment ago on the paper. It does not matter to us whether the solution be on the paper or whether it be in the jar, so long as we bring the ends of the apparatus to it. If I put the two platinums in by themselves, they come out as clean and as white as they go in [inserting them into the fluid without connecting them with the battery]; but when we take the power and lay that on [the platinums were connected with the battery and again dipped into the solution], this, you see [exhibiting one of the platinums], is at once turned into copper, as it were: it has become like a plate of copper; and that [exhibiting the other piece of platinum] has come out quite clean. If I take this coppered piece and change sides, the copper will leave the right-hand side and come over to the left side; what was before the coppered plate <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>clean,</b> and the plate which was clean comes out coated with copper; and thus you see that the same copper we put into this solution we can also take out of it by means of this instrument.|$|E

Sriramachandramurthy is, for {{the most}} part, scared during the lawyer's monologue, but eventually realises that he is being fooled again — this time by Charu Haasan, who is actually an actor hired by Chandran, while Uma was not actually crippled in the chase. At this point, all the main characters approach Sriramachandramurthy and tell him the truth. A visibly confused and shaken Sriramachandramurthy locks himself in a room, and <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>clean</b> shaven after a while, feeling {{that he does not}} need something which caused so much trouble. Sriramachandramurthy then laments to Lord Kartikeya about his foolishness.

Emil is smitten by Mini at first sight, but {{even though she is}} attracted to him, she keeps her distance, and this makes Emil suspect that Mini is afraid and hiding something. The business flourishes with Mini at the helm. They expand it to health club, moves into a new place and Emil starts his video studio nearby. He puts up advertisements of the beauty clinic with Mini's pictures without her consent. She is furious and threaten to quit until unless the advertisements are removed. Emil does that but his concern that she is hiding something grows. This is soon cemented when some people come enquiring about her and say that Mini had escaped from her last employer with stolen valuables.

Vince offers a $25,000 reward for an answer online. The team is swamped by suggestions sent in from the public. Vince decides to go with the majority diagnosis and demands to be tested for amyloidosis. Foreman makes a deal with him: Foreman will test for amyloidosis, but if the test result is negative then Vince must cease requesting help on the internet.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the group testing {{problem for a}} finite population of possibly defective items {{with the objective of}} sampling a prespecified demanded number of nondefective items at minimum cost. Group testing means that items can be pooled and tested together; if the group <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>clean,</b> all items in it are nondefective, while a "contaminated" group is scrapped. Every test takes a random amount of time and a given deadline has to be met. If the prescribed number of nondefective items is not reached, the demand has to be satisfied at a higher (penalty) cost. We derive explicit formulas for the distributions underlying the cost functionals of this model. It is shown in numerical examples that these results can be used to determine the optimal group size. ...|$|E

A touchless car wash uses chemicals and high water pressure to clean the vehicle instead of brushes, minimizing the chance of surface damage to the vehicle.

He fought wildly and even weakly, and he {{constantly}} looked away at the railway line, almost as if he feared the train more than the pointed steel. Syme, on the other hand, fought fiercely but still carefully, in an intellectual fury, eager to solve the riddle of his own bloodless sword. For this purpose, he aimed less at the Marquis's body, and more at his throat and head. A minute and a half afterwards he felt his point enter the man's neck below the jaw.

40|$|The MOOC’s (Massive open online classes) have {{ushered in}} a new era of {{learning}} overcoming the boundaries of time and geography to provide high quality education to masses who cannot afford university education. The major drawback however is that although they have best tried to capture classroom environment but facets such as teacher-student interaction and the usefulness of assignments as a source for enhanced understanding of subject matter have not been captured. Also it has led to plagiarism, which not only is a serious hazard but is also staining the otherwise excellent image the MOOC’s could have had. In this paper we propose a JADE based multi-agent system(MAS) as an effective step {{to solve the problem of}} plagiarism. The system has considered 2 types of plagiarism namely local and internet-based plagiarism. This will be used to filter out the students caught in plagiarism and students who <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>clean</b> will then have their solutions checked by using LEXICAL ANALYSIS to determine the styling and subjected to tests as well as codechecker to check for logical and syntactical correctness...|$|R

The old stockholders were McBride and his son Edward, along with minority owners including taxi business associate Dan Sherby, Brown and four others. The buyers were a group of prominent Cleveland men: Dave R. Jones, a businessman and former Cleveland Indians director, Ellis Ryan, a former Cleveland Indians president, Homer Marshman, an attorney who had founded the Cleveland Rams, Saul Silberman, owner of the horse race track later known as Thistledown Racecourse, and Ralph DeChairo, an associate of Silberman. While McBride never said so, the Kefauver hearings and the growing public association between him and the mafia may {{have played a role in}} his decision to get out of football. McBride said he had simply [...] "had his fling" [...] with football and wanted to concentrate on other business activities.

Previous to the Coventry Festival, Phish had announced plans to break up. This proved to be temporary once Phish launched its reunion announcements in October 2008. It was said that the band decided to break up because they were [...] "exhausted by touring and the strain of Anastasio's substance abuse." [...] However, during the band's break, Trey's consistent problems with drugs and alcohol harmed him worse than he had expected. On December 16, 2006 Trey Anastasio was pulled over at 3:30 AM one night in Whitehall, NY for failing to keep right.

There was no effusion of blood, he breathed with great difficulty, groaning and making a kind of hollow sound, was perfectly composed, gave me directions and messages in case of his death. I put on a poultice and bandage, and leaving him in charge of some one, went to Fisher. The wrist was shot through, but the upper part of the arrow broken off and deep down; bleeding profuse, of which I was glad; I cut deeply, though fearing much to cut an artery, but I could not extract the wooden arrow-head. At length getting a firm hold of the projecting point of the arrow on the lower side of his wrist, I pulled it through: it <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>clean.</b> The pain was very great, he trembled and shivered: we gave him brandy, and he recovered. I poulticed the wound and went to Edwin. Atkin had got out the splinter from his wound; the arrow went in near the eye and <b>came</b> <b>out</b> by the cheek-bone: it was well syringed, and the flow of blood had been copious from the first. The arrows were not bone-headed, and not poisoned, but I well knew that lock-jaw was to be dreaded. Edwin's was not much more than a flesh wound. Fisher's being in the wrist, frightened me more: their patience and quiet composure and calm resignation were indeed a strength and comfort to us all.|$|R

Dhananjay, the descendent of Gods, is Dhruva's most powerful ally and a good friend who not only provided him {{with the power to}} breathe inside water but is also ready to help whenever Dhruva needs him and vice versa. But amongst a long list of supporting characters in Dhruva series, the most important character has been Shweta, Dhruva's sister. She has been the strongest pillar of support in Dhruva's constant battle against evil on many levels. As a little sister, she engages with Dhruva in funny sibling banter, cheers him up and makes sure he never feels sad or misses his biological family. As a budding scientist, she constantly provides Dhruva with innovative gadgets that prove very helpful to Dhruva during his fights. But the highest level of support she provides {{is in the form of}} Chandika, a blonde super heroine, her alter ego. Chandika has inherited her brother's fighting style. Like Dhruva, she too depends on brains more than brawn as well as on her self-invented gadgets. She is always there to help Dhruva whenever he is in danger. Dhruva who is very protective about her sister, under strong suspicion that Shweta is in fact Chandika, often reprimands her for putting her life in danger. But Shweta somehow manages to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>clean</b> every time proving that she is not Chandika. Natasha is the only person who knows Chandika's true identity. Shweta eventually went to London in 2007 Makadjaal series to pursue her further studies.

5000|$|When {{she began}} her Silueta Series in the 1970s, Mendieta {{was one of many}} artists experimenting with the {{emerging}} genres of land art, body art, and performance art.The films and photographs of Siluetas are in connection with the figures surrounding her body. Mendieta was possibly the first to combine these genres in what she called [...] "earth-body" [...] sculptures. She often used her naked body to explore and connect with the Earth, as seen in her piece Imagen de Yagul, from the series Silueta Works in Mexico 1973-1977. Mendieta’s first use of blood to make art dates from 1972, when she performed Untitled (Death of a Chicken), for which she stood naked in front of a white wall holding a freshly decapitated chicken by its feet as its blood spattered her naked body. Appalled by the brutal rape and murder of nursing student Sarah Ann Ottens at the University of Iowa, Mendieta smeared herself with blood and had herself tied to a table in 1973, inviting an audience in to bear witness in Untitled (Rape Scene). Professor and art historian, Kaira Cabañas, writes about Untitled (Rape Scene):Her body was the subject and object of the work. She used it to emphasize the societal conditions by which the female body is colonized as the object of male desire and ravaged under masculine aggression. Mendieta's corporeal presence demanded the recognition of a female subject. The previously invisible, unnamed victim of rape gained an identity. The audience was forced to reflect on its responsibility; its empathy was elicited and translated to the space of awareness in which sexual violence could be addressed.In a slide series, People Looking at Blood Moffitt (1973), she pours blood and rags on a sidewalk and photographs a seemingly endless stream of people walking by without stopping, until the man next door (the storefront window bears the name H.

Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; how then can there be found one word that should please God? 4.
