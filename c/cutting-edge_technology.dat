5|$|Perkin-Elmer {{intended}} to use custom-built and extremely sophisticated computer-controlled polishing machines to grind the mirror to the required shape. However, in case their <b>cutting-edge</b> <b>technology</b> ran into difficulties, NASA demanded that PE sub-contract to Kodak to construct a back-up mirror using traditional mirror-polishing techniques. (The team of Kodak and Itek also bid on the original mirror polishing work. Their bid called for the two companies to double-check each other's work, which would have almost certainly caught the polishing error that later caused such problems.) The Kodak mirror is now on permanent display at the National Air and Space Museum. An Itek mirror built {{as part of the}} effort is now used in the 2.4m telescope at the Magdalena Ridge Observatory.|$|E
5|$|Die Another Day was novelised by the then-official James Bond writer, Raymond Benson, {{based on}} the {{screenplay}} by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. An effort is made to depict some of the film's more outlandish elements with more believability, {{in the style of}} Fleming's original novels' use of <b>cutting-edge</b> <b>technology.</b> So for example, the non-bodywork elements of the Aston Martin with its 'cloaking' function – the glass windows and rubber tyres – are described as having retractable covers to achieve the invisibility effect. Fan reaction to it was above average. After its publication Benson retired as the official James Bond novelist and a new series featuring the secret agent's adventures as a teenager, by Charlie Higson, was launched in 2005. As the novelisation was published after Benson's final original 007 novel, The Man with the Red Tattoo, it was the final literary work featuring Bond as originally conceived by Ian Fleming until the publication of Devil May Care by Sebastian Faulks in 2008 to mark the 100th anniversary of Fleming's birth.|$|E

25|$|Fisher {{returned}} to Excellent in 1864 as a gunnery instructor, where he remained until 1869. Towards {{the end of}} his posting he became interested in torpedoes, which were invented during the 1860s, and championed their cause as a relatively simple weapon capable of sinking a battleship. His expertise with torpedoes led to his being invited to Germany in June 1869 for the founding ceremony of a new naval base at Wilhelmshaven, where he met King William I of Prussia (soon to become German emperor), Bismarck and Moltke. Perhaps inspired by the visit, he started preparing a paper on the design, construction and management of electrical torpedoes, the <b>cutting-edge</b> <b>technology</b> of the time.|$|E

25|$|The Lambertseter Line and the Østensjø Line existed {{as light}} rail lines, and were {{upgraded}} to metro standard. The Grorud Line and the Furuset Line were new and ran through previously undeveloped neighborhoods in Groruddalen. During construction, groundwork and electrical equipment was contracted to developers, while the trackage {{was done by}} the planning office. The original plans called for the use of 600 to 650 volt (V) direct current (DC) fed via a pantograph, to allow comparability with the light rail. This was later changed to 750V DC via a third rail, allowing reduced maintenance costs and a larger contract surface, permitted a larger electric current and more power to the trains. The system also used cab signaling and moving blocks, which were <b>cutting-edge</b> <b>technology</b> at the time, and had previously only been implemented on the Stockholm Metro in Europe. The minimum allowed distance between trains was set to 90 seconds on the common section and 120 seconds on the branch lines. The tunnel, along with the upgraded Lambertseter Line, opened on 23 May 1966. The Grorud Line was connected on 16 October 1966, the Østensjø Line on 29 October 1967, and the Furuset Line on 18 November 1970.|$|E

500|$|The {{resulting}} design {{went through}} considerable evolution, owing to both its <b>cutting-edge</b> <b>technology</b> and continual redefinition of the USAF requirements. Early revisions prominently featured canards, with {{a span of}} 19ft 10in (6.04 m), and a wing of 53.5° sweep. The aircraft in this configuration {{would have had a}} maximum takeoff weight of 99,400lb (45,088kg) with a 72,550 feet (22,113 m) operational ceiling. In addition to the F-108's interceptor role, North American proposed it as an escort fighter for its own B-70 Valkyrie supersonic bomber prototype. Commonality between the B-70 bomber and the F-108 included the escape capsule and General Electric YJ93 engines. Another role considered was for the F-108 to be [...] "gap-fillers" [...] for the Distant Early Warning (DEW) system; because of its great speed, the F-108 could have scanned up to [...] per hour.|$|E

500|$|Kubrick {{was among}} the first {{directors}} to use video assist during filming. At the time he began using it in 1966, it was considered <b>cutting-edge</b> <b>technology,</b> requiring him to build his own system. Having it in place during the filming of 2001, he was able to view a video of a take immediately after it was filmed. On some films, such as Barry Lyndon, he used custom made zoom lenses, which allowed him to start a scene with a close-up and slowly zoom out to capture the full panorama of scenery and to film long takes under changing outdoor lighting conditions by making aperture adjustments while the cameras rolled. LoBrutto notes that Kubrick's technical knowledge about lenses [...] "dazzled the manufacturer's engineers, who found him to be unprecedented among contemporary filmmakers". For Barry Lyndon he also used a specially adapted high-speed (f/0.7) Zeiss camera lens, originally developed for NASA, to shoot numerous scenes lit only with candlelight. Actor Steven Berkoff recalls that Kubrick wanted scenes to be shot using [...] "pure candlelight", and in doing so Kubrick [...] "made a unique contribution to the art of filmmaking going back to painting... You almost posed like for portraits." [...] LoBrutto notes that cinematographers all over the world wanted to know about Kubrick's [...] "magic lens" [...] and that he became a [...] "legend" [...] among cameramen around the world.|$|E
