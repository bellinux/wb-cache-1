Seasonal demands create many problems to service organizations, such as:- idling the capacity, fixed cost and excess expenditure on marketing and promotions.

40|$|The paper aims to {{identify}} potential connections between migration and food <b>consumption</b> <b>habits</b> of Romanian immigrants in Andalusia, Spain and {{to study a}} series of factors that {{may contribute to the}} establishment of these connections. The analysis was based on a series of information obtained through a field research carried out between January and June 2011 among the Romanian immigrants in Andalusia (306 respondents). The analysis’ results revealed the fact that after migration, the Romanian immigrants {{who took part in the}} study felt a series of changes in their food <b>consumption</b> <b>habits,</b> mainly resulting in consuming a higher proportion of the food products specific to the host country, compared to the food products specific to their country of origin. The analysed factors that may influence the relationship between migration and food <b>consumption</b> <b>habits</b> were encountered in the specific scientific literature, namely the length of residence and immigrants’ age. The analysis revealed the fact that among different groups of respondents by length of residence and age, there are statistically significant differences in what concerns their perception regarding the changes in their food <b>consumption</b> <b>habits</b> after migration. The length of residence is positively correlated with the changes in food consumption after migration, while age is negatively correlated. migration, immigrant, consumer, consumption, food products, <b>consumption</b> <b>habits,</b> consumer behaviour, Romania, Spain...|$|R

The increase in average consumption habits is the difference between average consumption flows and existing average consumption habits adjusted for by the speed of the <b>consumption</b> <b>habit</b> formation.

40|$|A {{decline in}} the {{relative}} price of imported goods {{compared to that of}} domestically produced goods, e. g., caused by domestic currency appreciation, may have different effects on domestic consumption. Such effects may not be accurately detected and measured in a classical permanent-income model without considering <b>consumption</b> <b>habit</b> formation as pointed out by Nishiyama (2005). To resolve this problem, this paper employs an extended permanent-income model which encompasses <b>consumption</b> <b>habit</b> formation. Both cointegration analysis and GMM are used to estimate the (modified) intertemporal elasticities of substitution (IES) between imports and domestic consumption and the parameters of habit formation as well as the (modified) intratemporal elasticities of substitution (AES). We find that import and domestic consumptions are complements in China, but substitutes in Japan and Korea. Different per capita incomes and consumer behaviors between China and the other two countries are two possible reasons for different relationships between import and domestic consumptions.

40|$|We econometrically {{estimate}} a consumption-based asset {{pricing model}} with stochastic internal habit and test it using the generalized method of moments. The model departs from existing models with deterministic internal habit (e. g., Dunn and Singleton (1983), Ferson and Constan- tinides (1991), and Heaton (1995)) by introducing shocks to the coefficients in the distributed lag specification of <b>consumption</b> <b>habit</b> and consequently an additional {{shock to the}} marginal rate of substitution. The stochastic shocks to the <b>consumption</b> <b>habit</b> are persistent and provide an additional source of time variation in expected returns. Using Treasury bond returns and broad equity market index returns, we show that stochastic internal habit formation models resolve the dichotomy between the autocorrelation properties of the stochastic discount factor and those of expected returns. Consequently, they provide a better explanation of time-variation in expected returns than models with either deterministic habit or stochastic external habit.

More evidence about the fit of the NKDSGE models is also reviewed. The NKDSGE models are evaluated using alternative priors, and modification of the VARs gen-erating the posterior distributions, and a different goodness of fit statistic.
