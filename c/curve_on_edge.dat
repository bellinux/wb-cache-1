5000|$|Hand Weapons: Cobra-La citizens, Pythona in particular, use several unnamed weapons, {{including}} a starfish-like creature which is thrown at targets and then constricts its tentacles. Another is a small, formless, green object that, when squeezed, emits {{some sort of}} knockout gas, a creature {{that appears to be}} an actual starfish which is thrown like a shuriken, and a creature that seems to be four snakes joined in a cross shape at their center, which is immune or highly resistant to electricity and is capable of chewing through metals. Pythona used a clamshell that generated thin strips which wrapped around opponents. She attacked several Joes in Recon Sleds with trilobite-looking creatures that exploded, wrecking their vehicles. The Cobra-La royal guards are shown using a single weapon; a large golden scimitar, which is highly <b>curved</b> <b>on</b> one <b>edge,</b> and serrated <b>on</b> the other. Cobra-La also has a small, hand-held plant that emits a white mist which is capable of causing temporary blindness.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to address image lag in target {{tracking}} and its influence on the accuracy of target tracking. Fluoroscopic images were obtained using a direct type of dynamic flat-panel detector (FPD). Image lag properties, modulation transfer function (MTF), and profile curves were measured. Digital phantoms of metal sphere with and without blurred edge due to image lag were simulated using the results, respectively, and then superimposed on breathing chest radiographs of a patient. The moving target with and without image lag was traced using a template-matching technique. In the results, the image lag for the first frame after X-ray cutoff was 2. 0 % and decreased to less than 0. 1 % in the fifth frame. In the measurement of profile <b>curves</b> <b>on</b> the <b>edges</b> of tungsten material plates, the effect of image lag was seen as blurred edges of the plate. The blurred edges of the plate were also indicated as reduction of MTF. However, the target could be traced without tracking error. The results indicated that there was no effect of image lag on target tracking in usual breathing speed in a radiotherapy situation...|$|R
40|$|Real-time tumor {{tracking}} in external radiotherapy can {{be achieved}} by diagnostic (kV) X-ray imaging with a dynamic flat-panel detector (FPD). The {{purpose of this study was}} to address image lag in target tracking and its influence on the accuracy of tumor tracking. Fluoroscopic images were obtained using a direct type of dynamic FPD. Image lag properties were measured without test devices according to IEC 62220 - 1. Modulation transfer function (MTF) and profile <b>curves</b> were measured <b>on</b> the <b>edges</b> of a moving tungsten plate at movement rate of 10 and 20 mm/s, covering lung tumor movement of normal breathing. A lung tumor and metal sphere with blurred edge due to image lag was simulated using the results and then superimposed on breathing chest radiographs of a patient. The moving target with and without image lag was traced using a template-matching technique. In the results, the image lag for the first frame after X-ray cutoff was 2. 0 % and decreased to less than 0. 1 % in the fifth frame. In the measurement of profile <b>curves</b> <b>on</b> the <b>edges</b> of static and moving tungsten material plates, the effect of image lag was seen as blurred edges of the plate. The blurred edges of a moving target were indicated as reduction of MTF. However, the target could be traced within an error of ± 5 mm.

5|$|Cladistic {{analyses}} of tyrannosaurid phylogeny often find Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus to be sister taxa, with Daspletosaurus more basal than either. A {{close relationship between}} Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus is supported by numerous skull features, including the pattern of sutures between certain bones, {{the presence of a}} crescent-shaped crest on the postorbital bone behind each eye, and a very deep maxilla with a noticeable downward <b>curve</b> <b>on</b> the lower <b>edge,</b> among others. An alternative hypothesis was presented in a 2003 study by Phil Currie and colleagues, which found weak support for Daspletosaurus as a basal member of a clade also including Tarbosaurus and Alioramus, both from Asia, based on the absence of a bony prong connecting the nasal and lacrimal bones. Alioramus was found to be the closest relative of Tarbosaurus in this study, based on a similar pattern of stress distribution in the skull.|$|R
5000|$|Hoping {{to get the}} Road Runner to {{run into}} it, Wile E. places a mirror <b>on</b> a <b>curve</b> <b>on</b> the very <b>edge</b> of a mountain, but soon discovers that his {{reflection}} is mocking him. To {{figure out where the}} [...] "reflection" [...] is coming from, the coyote snakes around the mirror to the side and discovers nothing there. Puzzled, the coyote retracts his neck, and soon suffers gravity due to his location in thin air. But in the dump where he falls is an inspiration: Wile E. scavenges a wealth of spare parts and takes them offscreen where construction noises are heard. Road Runner is left curious as to what his opponent is doing and curiously looks around the rock Wile is working behind. However, curiosity quickly turns to outright terror when Wile E. unveils his creation: a blue robotic coyote at least five times as tall as himself.|$|R
50|$|The fang {{appendages}} (chelicerae) {{are strong}} and vertically oriented. They possess large forward facing teeth on the cheliceral groove, three in females and four in males, evenly spaced from each other. Very small backward facing teeth (denticles) are {{also present in}} a row on the basal half of the cheliceral groove, five in females and three to four in males. A spine is present on the upper side of the tip. Sound-producing ridges on the chelicerae (stridulatory organs) are absent in females but present in males. The chewing appendages (maxillae) are located immediately behind the chelicerae. They are strongly <b>curved</b> <b>on</b> the outside <b>edges</b> and tapers into a blunt tip. They possess serrated edges (serrulae) used to cut up prey. The lower lip (labium) which covers the mouth opening has an indentation at the tip. It is 0.83 mm long and 0.87 mm wide in females. In males, it is 0.69 mm long and 0.85 mm wide.|$|R
50|$|The {{shells of}} Trigonoconcha have {{anterior}} and posterior sides which meet {{at an angle}} {{of no more than}} sixty-five degrees. While this is similar to the related genera Palaeoconcha and Similodonta, they are both noted for anterior-posterior angles of no less than ninety degrees. The presence of an auricle, a finger-like projection {{on the underside of the}} umbo, in Palaeoconcha also distinguishes specimens from Trigonoconcha. Similodonta is distinguished from both other genera by an edentulous space, a region on the hinge that lacks teeth. The umbo of Trigonoconcha is located at the vertex formed by the anterior and posterior sides and the ventral margin forms a broad <b>curving</b> <b>edge.</b> <b>On</b> smaller shells, possibly from immature specimens, the ventral margin curves abruptly to meet the anterior and posterior margins creating a triangular shell outline.|$|R
40|$|A common {{criticism}} of many visual interactive evolutionary design systems {{is that most}} of what they generate “all looks the same”. For any given system’s output, formal visual characteristics can frequently be identified that are shared by a majority of designs produced by the system. These visual traits can either be expressed in terms of shared de-sign features (e. g., all corners are sharp) or a near complete absence of traits (e. g., no <b>curved</b> <b>edges</b> <b>on</b> any individuals). Several simple shape representations are presented here to illustrate and explore the relationship between the use of var-ious approaches for constructing design spaces and the visual traits which result. It is argued that the relative signature of a system is determined by the amount that the design space representation biases both the possibility and probability of the emergence of specific visual design attributes. ...|$|R

5|$|Abelisaurids, {{especially}} Majungasaurus, may instead {{have been}} adapted for a feeding strategy {{more similar to}} modern felids, with short and broad snouts, that bite once and hold on until the prey is subdued. Majungasaurus had an even broader snout than other abelisaurids, {{and other aspects of}} its anatomy may also support the bite-and-hold hypothesis. The neck was strengthened, with robust vertebrae, interlocking ribs and ossified tendons, as well as reinforced muscle attachment sites on the vertebrae and the back of the skull. These muscles {{would have been able to}} hold the head steady despite the struggles of its prey. Abelisaurid skulls were also strengthened in many areas by bone mineralized out of the skin, creating the characteristic rough texture of the bones. This is particularly true of Majungasaurus, where the nasal bones were fused and thickened for strength. On the other hand, the lower jaw of Majungasaurus sported a large fenestra (opening) on each side, as seen in other ceratosaurs, as well as synovial joints between certain bones that allowed a high degree of flexibility in the lower jaw, although not to the extent seen in snakes. This may have been an adaptation to prevent the fracture of the lower jaw when holding onto a struggling prey animal. The front teeth of the upper jaw were more robust than the rest, to provide an anchor point for the bite, while the low crown height of Majungasaurus teeth prevented them from breaking off during a struggle. Finally, unlike the teeth of Allosaurus and most other theropods, which were <b>curved</b> <b>on</b> both the front and back, abelisaurids like Majungasaurus had teeth <b>curved</b> <b>on</b> the front <b>edge</b> but straighter <b>on</b> the back (cutting) edge. This structure may have served to prevent slicing, and instead holding the teeth in place when biting.|$|R

40|$|Partially Averaged Navier Stokes {{is used to}} {{simulate}} the flow around a simple train model. The train model has previously been studied in wind tunnel experiments and has a length to height/width ratio of 7 : 1. The Reynolds number based on {{the height of the}} train model is 0. 37 x 10 ^ 6. For this Reynolds number, the flow separates from the <b>curved</b> leading <b>edges</b> <b>on</b> the front then attaches again on the roof and sides forming a boundary layer there before separating in the wake. The first case is of the natural flow around the train model where direct comparison to experimental data of drag coefficient and pressure coefficient are made. In the second case an open cavity is placed on the base of the train model with the aim of reducing the overall drag on the model. The results show that the drag for model with the cavity is reduced by some 10 % compared to the drag of the natural case. The agreement to experimental data for the natural case is not perfect but the general features in the flow field are simulated correctly...|$|R
