These systems transfer heat to a secondary heat exchanger via the essential service water system, using water pumped out to sea or an onsite cooling tower.

The Chernobyl disaster occurred during a botched test of this system. The ECCS has three systems, connected to the coolant system headers. In case of damage, the first ECCS subsystem provides cooling for up to 100 seconds to the damaged half of the coolant circuit (the other half is cooled by the main circulation pumps), and the other two subsystems then handle long-term cooling of the reactor.|$|E

In this work, we present a systematic analysis of BCGs and strong radio AGN in 152 groups and clusters from the Chandra archive. All 69 BCGs with radio AGN more luminous than 2 x 10 ^ 23 W Hz^- 1 at 1. 4 GHz are found to have X-ray <b>cool</b> <b>cores.</b> The BCG <b>cool</b> <b>cores</b> can be divided into two classes, the large-cool-core (LCC) class and the corona class.

Strong radio outbursts triggered by coronae may destroy embryonic large <b>cool</b> <b>cores</b> and thus provide another mechanism to prevent formation of large <b>cool</b> <b>cores.</b> However, it is unclear whether coronae are decoupled from the radio feedback cycles as they have to be largely immune to strong radio outbursts. Our sample study also shows the absence of groups with a luminous <b>cool</b> <b>core</b> while hosting a strong radio AGN, which is not observed in clusters. This points to a greater impact of radio heating on low-mass systems than clusters. As examples of the corona class, we also present detailed analyses of a BCG corona associated with a strong radio AGN (ESO 137 - 006 in A 3627) and one of the faintest coronae known (NGC 4709 in the Centaurus cluster).

From 19972007 the Byron plant has received five such actions, two of which resulted in a total of $150,000 in fines.

40|$|We {{present a}} new model for the {{creation}} of <b>cool</b> <b>cores</b> in rich galaxy clusters within a CDM cosmological framework using the results from high spatial dynamic range, adaptive mesh hydro/N-body simulations. It is proposed that <b>cores</b> of <b>cool</b> gas rst form in subclusters and these subclusters merge to create rich clusters with cool, central X-Ray excesses. The rich cool clusters do not possess ows " due to the presence of bulk velocities in the intracluster medium in excess of 1000 km/sec produced by on-going accretion of gas from supercluster laments. This new model has several attractive features including the presence of substantial core substructure within the <b>cool</b> <b>cores,</b> and it predicts the appearance of cool bullets, cool fronts, and cool laments all of which have been recently observed with X-Ray satellites.

2500|$|During normal operation, the {{containment}} is air-tight and access is only through marine style airlocks. High air temperature and {{radiation from the}} core limit the time, measured in minutes, people can spend inside containment while the plant is operating at full power. In {{the event of a}} worst-case emergency, called a [...] "design basis accident" [...] in NRC regulations, {{the containment}} is designed to seal off and contain a meltdown. Redundant systems are installed to prevent a meltdown, but as a matter of policy, one is assumed to occur and thus the requirement for a containment building. For design purposes, the reactor vessel's piping is assumed to be breached, causing a [...] "LOCA" [...] (loss Of coolant accident) where the water in the reactor vessel is released to the atmosphere inside the containment and flashes into steam. The resulting pressure increase inside the containment, which is designed to withstand the pressure, triggers containment sprays ("dousing sprays") to turn on to condense the steam and thus reduce the pressure. A SCRAM ("neutronic trip") initiates very shortly after the break occurs. The safety systems close non-essential lines into the air-tight containment by shutting the isolation valves.

2500|$|As the {{pressure}} in the primary system continued to decrease, reactor coolant continued to flow, but it was boiling inside the core. First, small bubbles of steam formed and immediately collapsed, known as nucleate boiling. As the system pressure decreased further, steam pockets began to form in the reactor coolant. This {{departure from nucleate boiling}} (DNB) into the regime of [...] "film boiling" [...] caused steam voids in coolant channels, blocking the flow of liquid coolant and greatly increasing the fuel cladding temperature. The overall water level inside the pressurizer was rising despite the loss of coolant through the open pilot-operated relief valve, as the volume of these steam voids increased much more quickly than coolant was lost. Because of the lack of a dedicated instrument to measure the level of water in the core, operators judged the level of water in the core solely by the level in the pressurizer. Since it was high, they assumed that the core was properly covered with coolant, unaware that because of steam forming in the reactor vessel, the indicator provided misleading readings. Indications of high water levels contributed to the confusion, as operators were concerned about the primary loop [...] "going solid," [...] (i.e. no steam pocket buffer existing in the pressurizer) which in training they had been instructed to never allow. This confusion was a key contributor to the initial failure to recognize the accident as a loss-of-coolant accident, and led operators to turn off the emergency <b>core</b> <b>cooling</b> pumps, which had automatically started after the pilot-operated relief valve stuck and core coolant loss began, due to fears the system was being overfilled.|$|E
