The player must defend themselves from a deteriorated animatronic-costume hybrid known as [...] "Springtrap", which was the sole animatronic the attraction workers were able to discover. [...] Burnt and tattered hallucinations of previous games' animatronics also appear, but can not directly kill the player, and instead hinder ventilation, sound, and camera systems, which may also fail by other means. Failure to maintain these systems can create many issues for the player, including dysfunctional cameras, and the inability to play audio in order to lure away the animatronic. The player receives guidance from a founder of the horror attraction for the first <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>nights,</b> but also listens to old tape recordings discovered by the attraction workers related to the backstory of previous locations.|$|E

The {{first part of the}} ride was uneventful, and the group did not experience any violence. They stopped in Nashville to stay at the Freedom House with Diane Nash and Rodney Powell, and they joined in a picket of a grocery store there. The Freedom Riders continued on their journey and were arrested when they arrived in Jackson, Mississippi. Police Chief Captain Ray met them inside the door of the black waiting room, and they were taken to the Jackson City Jail. After a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>nights</b> they were transferred to the Hines County Jail, and when that facility filled up they were moved to Mississippi’s notorious Parchman Farm. While there, Aelony participated in a hunger strike with several others, and he was isolated {{for a period of time}} for writing [...] "you’ll reap what you sow" [...] on the back wall with a spoon. In [...] retrospect, [...] the federal government seemed slow to respond to the request from civil rights workers to enforce the interstate commerce clause decision [...] by the supreme court, [...] both for political reasons, for caution, and until international pressures arose to demonstrate US [...] commitment to democracy, freedom of travel, and equality under the law.

Critically and commercially acclaimed, the album spawned six singles, including the worldwide hits [...] "SexyBack", [...] "My Love" [...] and [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around". After wrapping up a worldwide concert tour {{in support of}} the album in 2007, Timberlake took a break from his music career to focus on acting. In 2010, Timberlake's manager, Johnny Wright, began conversations with the singer about working on new music. The two had general decisions about ways to release new music, because according to Wright, [...] "a lot of the physical record sellers were gone, by the time we've got music again we need to think about different ways to deliver it". Wright proposed a promotion based on an application or releasing a new song every month. Timberlake, however, was not interested in going back into music and instead continued to focus on his film career. Around the [...] "late part of May/first week in June" [...] 2012, Timberlake asked Wright to dinner and revealed to him that he had spent the last <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>nights</b> in studio with Timbaland working on new material. Wright was shocked at the revelation, telling Billboard magazine that he [...] "wasn't prepared for that." [...] The two immediately began marketing plans for how the album should be promoted and when it should be released.

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1884, Gordon {{had no interest in}} the Sudan and had just been hired to work as an officer with the newly established Congo Free State. Gordon [...] despite or rather because of his war hero status [...] disliked publicity and tried to avoid the press when he was in Britain. While staying with his sister in Southampton, Gordon received an unexpected visitor, namely William Thomas Stead, the editor of the Pall Mall Gazette, whom Gordon reluctantly agreed to do an interview with. Gordon wanted to talk about the Congo, but Stead kept on pressing him to talk about the Sudan; finally after much prompting on Stead's part Gordon opened up and attacked Gladstone's Sudan policy, coming out for an intervention to crush the Mahdi. Gordon offered up a 19th-century version of the domino theory, claiming: The danger arises from the influence which the spectacle of a conquering Mahometan [...] Power established close to your frontiers will exercise upon the population which you govern. In all the cities of Egypt it will be felt that what the Mahdi has done they may do; and, as he has driven out the intruder, they may do the same. Stead published his interview on 9 January 1884 {{on the front page of}} the Pall Mall Gazette alongside the leader (editorial) he had written entitled [...] "Chinese Gordon for the Sudan". Urban wrote: [...] "With this leader, William Stead's real motive in going to Southampton revealed itself at last. As to who tipped him off that the general would be staying here for just a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>nights,</b> we can only speculate".|$|E

More reliefs took place with the 22nd and 26th Canadian battalions replacing the 20th and 19th Canadian battalions. On 12 April, Plumer and Turner decided to concentrate on improving the front line; the frequent battalion reliefs were necessary due to fatigue and lack of sleep under constant bombardment, with no cover amidst mud and waterlogged shell holes. The Germans made occasional bomb attacks, intermittently bombarded the British lines during the day and fired Shrapnel shell bombardments at night, to catch working parties. During the night of [...] the 24th Canadian Battalion relieved the 25th and an officer crawled round the craters, reporting that the four along the old German front line were occupied. On 16 April, the weather improved enough for air reconnaissance by the RFC and photographs showed that the Germans had dug a trench {{to the west of the}} craters. Plans for more attacks were cancelled and on the night of [...] the 5th Canadian Brigade was relieved by the 6th Canadian Brigade. For the next two weeks, both sides exchanged artillery-fire and the British front line, support trenches and communication trenches were demolished; the new trench covering the Germans in [...] was not as badly damaged, because the British heavy artillery was subject to ammunition rationing. On 19 April, the Germans took [...] but patrols found that they were left unoccupied and an attack on crater 1 was defeated.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} {{policies}} dealing with homelessness. In 1980 the government {{decided to start}} sending funding to people that are homeless, {{but it was not}} until 1984 that shelters were built to accommodate and feed them. As it was shown though seventy percent required homeless people to attend a religious ceremony and spend only a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>nights</b> there. In the 1987 McKinney Act the problem with homelessness became known as a huge social problem. Later on, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (P.L. 107-110) amended the program explicitly to prohibit states that receive McKinney-Vento funds from segregating homeless students from non-homeless students, except for short periods of time for health and safety emergencies or to provide temporary, special, supplementary services. The Chronic Homelessness Initiative. The George W. Bush Administration established a national goal of ending chronic homelessness in ten years, by 2012. The idea of a 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness began as a part of a 10-year plan to end homelessness in general adopted by the National Alliance to End Homelessness (NAEH) in 2000. The following year, then-Secretary Martinez announced HUD's commitment to ending chronic homelessness at the NAEH annual conference. In 2002, as a part of his FY2003 budget, President Bush made [...] "ending chronic homelessness in the next decade a top objective." [...] The bi-partisan, congressionally mandated, Millennial Housing Commission, in its Report to Congress in 2002, included ending chronic homelessness in 10 years among its principal recommendations. By 2003, the Interagency Council on Homelessness had been re-engaged and charged with pursuing the President's 10-year plan. The Administration has recently undertaken some collaborative efforts to reach its goal of ending chronic homelessness in 10 years. On October 1, 2003, the Administration announced the award of over $48 million in grants aimed at serving the needs of the chronically homeless through two initiatives. The [...] "Ending Chronic Homelessness through Employment and Housing" [...] initiative was a collaborative grant offered jointly by HUD and the Department of Labor (DOL). The initiative offered $10 million from HUD and $3.5 million from DOL to help the chronically homeless in five communities gain access to employment and permanent housing. Section 8 is the core housing program that helps extremely low-income families accommodate the gap between their incomes below 30 percent of the median income for each community. The government assists homeless families by awarding grants and vouchers. Vouchers are available to the families who are most needy and they are used to pay for housing found in the private market. Currently there are policy changes in who receives vouchers and there will be a reduction in the number of vouchers granted to the population of people that are homeless [...]|$|E

As though with some intention of intervening, he moved a step forward, almost in line with Dory. Rounceby saw him, and a new fear gripped him by the heart. He shrank back, his fingers relaxed their hold of his weapon, the sweat was hot upon his forehead. Marnstam, though he seemed for a moment stupefied, realised the miracle which had happened and struck boldly for his own.|$|R
