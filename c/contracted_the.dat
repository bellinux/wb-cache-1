40|$|Classically, {{the root}} of <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> is <b>the</b> {{agreement}} of <b>the</b> <b>contracting</b> parties. That is why, sometime people consider <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> as <b>the</b> agreement of <b>the</b> <b>contracting</b> parties. However, <b>the</b> agreement is not <b>the</b> <b>contract.</b> <b>The</b> both are different. In fact, if for <b>the</b> <b>contracting</b> parties there is a contract after an agreement, for the law there is a <b>contract</b> when <b>the</b> agreement of <b>the</b> <b>contracting</b> parties respects <b>the</b> frame previewed by the law. That is why <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> must be an institution. This view of <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> enables to have another meaning and to gather the keys ideas of the different opinions {{on the meaning of}} <b>the</b> <b>contract.</b> Thanks to <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> as an institution, we can no longer be afraid of the crisis of <b>the</b> <b>contract...</b>|$|R
50|$|The act of invalidating <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> by <b>the</b> party exercising its {{rights to}} annul <b>the</b> {{voidable}} <b>contract</b> is usually referred to either as voiding <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> (in <b>the</b> United States and Canada) or avoiding <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> (in <b>the</b> United Kingdom, Australia and other common law countries).|$|R

50|$|In <b>contract</b> law <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> {{price is}} a {{material}} term. <b>The</b> <b>contract</b> price is <b>the</b> {{price for the}} goods or services to be received in <b>the</b> <b>contract.</b> <b>The</b> <b>contract</b> price helps {{to determine whether a}} contract may exist.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{two types}} of contract structures in a model where a trade union supplies labor to an industry, and sets the wage to maximize welfare.

Under short-term <b>contracts,</b> <b>the</b> union sets the wage after the firms 2 ̆ 7 investment is in place, but also after the industry price is known. Under long- term <b>contracts,</b> <b>the</b> wage is chosen before investment and before the industry price is known. With short-term <b>contracts</b> <b>the</b> union has the benefit of ex-post wage flexibility, while under long-term <b>contracts</b> <b>the</b> union has the benefit of advance wage commitment which {{may be an important}} determinant of <b>contract</b> structure. <b>The</b> trade-off is examined in detail...|$|R

5|$|Wiggins' family {{initially}} attributed {{his death}} to lung cancer {{that had led}} to respiratory failure.

Several days later, a physician disclosed that Wiggins' health problems were complications of AIDS. Wiggins stated that he had <b>contracted</b> <b>the</b> disease via intravenous drug use.

5|$|After {{the lethal}} second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly– almost to nothing after {{the peak in}} the second wave. In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 {{people died in the}} week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, {{influenza}} had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of the disease is that doctors simply got better at preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims had <b>contracted</b> <b>the</b> virus, although John Barry stated in his book that researchers have found no evidence to support this.|$|E

5|$|Bass moved {{production}} of Stones to its Burton upon Trent and Tadcaster breweries. In 2000, Bass sold its brewing interests, including their breweries and the Stones brand to the Belgian brewer Interbrew. Interbrew <b>contracted</b> <b>the</b> {{production of}} cask conditioned Stones to Marston's in Burton. Competition concerns forced Interbrew {{to sell off}} certain brands in December 2001, including Stones Bitter, which was bought by the American Coors Brewing Company (later Molson Coors). Molson Coors currently produce keg Stones Bitter at their brewery in Tadcaster, and the canned version at their Burton brewery. The cask product was initially contract brewed at the Highgate Brewery in Walsall, West Midlands, before moving to Everards of Leicester in 2005. The cask product ceased production in June 2012.|$|E
5|$|Chronic wasting disease, {{transmitted}} by a misfolded protein {{known as a}} prion, affects the brain tissue in elk, and has been detected throughout their range in North America. First documented in the late 1960s in mule deer, the disease has affected elk on game farms and in the wild {{in a number of}} regions. Elk that have <b>contracted</b> <b>the</b> disease begin to show weight loss, increased watering needs, disorientation and listlessness, and at an advanced stage the disease leads to death. The disease is similar to but not the same as mad cow disease, and no risks to humans have been documented, nor has the disease been demonstrated to pose a threat to domesticated cattle. In 2002, South Korea banned the importation of elk antler velvet due to concerns about chronic wasting disease.|$|E
5|$|Formby's {{health was}} further damaged in the {{influenza}} pandemic of 1918, {{during which he}} <b>contracted</b> <b>the</b> disease while appearing at the Manchester Hippodrome {{and was unable to}} work for a month. He was taken ill during the runs of pantomimes in both 1918 and 1919, was forced to rest for three months in 1919, and collapsed on stage during a performance in Newcastle upon Tyne in the 1920–21 pantomime season. Formby was advised by doctors to emigrate to South Africa for the benefit of his health, but he preferred to stay in Britain, with his wife and children, and continued to work. During his performances his wife would wait in the wings with ice for him to suck to stop internal bleeding, and an oxygen tent was present in the stage wings ready for emergencies.|$|E

5|$|In 1972, {{sessions}} for the album started, with recording {{taking place at}} three different studios in Kingston, Jamaica: Dynamic Sound, Harry J's and Randy's. Engineer Sylvan Morris put the songs on eight-track tape, and allocated tracks with the drum mixes on one track and piano and guitar together on another. In the winter of 1972, Marley flew back to London to present the master tapes. The deal with Island led to a dispute with CBS and Sims, to whom the band were already <b>contracted.</b> <b>The</b> Island Records label won the resulting court case, and it received US$9,000 and two percent of royalties from the band's first six albums, and Sims received 5,000 and the publishing rights to the Wailers songs.|$|E
