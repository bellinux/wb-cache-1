50|$|The {{pantographs}} are screw-mounted to {{the roof}} at three points. Pantograph 1 is connected directly through the roof to the main control switch in the engine room; pantograph 2 is connected via a <b>cable</b> <b>splice</b> running along the side wall of the engine room to the main switch. The contact shoes are outfitted with a monitoring system in case of contact shoe breakage. Inside of the contact shoe, which is made of graphite, runs an air channel, which is overpressurised. In case of breakage, the air escapes, causing the pantograph to automatically retract, preventing possible damage to the overhead contact wire.|$|E

40|$|The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) main {{interconnection}} splices {{consist of}} Rutherford-type <b>cable</b> <b>splice</b> and busbar stabilizer splices. Busbar stabilizer splices have been consolidated {{during the first}} long LHC shutdown by soldering additional Cu shunts. In view of {{the large number of}} quality controls (QCs) that were integrated in the splice consolidation process, efficient and unambiguous QC procedures needed to be developed. Direct-current electrical resistance measurements have been selected for the control of the busbar splices and the individual shunts. About 400 [*] 000 resistance measurements performed at room temperature before and after each consolidation step have been analyzed. The resistance of the consolidated splices is comparable with the resistance of continuous busbars without splice. Resistance changes during the consolidation process correspond to those calculated from the changes in Cu cross-sectional area...|$|E
40|$|The {{different}} LHC main bus bar splice components (bus bar <b>cable,</b> <b>splice</b> U-piece and wedge and bus bar stabilizer) {{are subjected}} to different heat treatments (HTs) during bus bar assembly and splice soldering. The influence of soldering HTs on the RRR of the LHC main bus bar cable strands has been determined. The RRR of several splice U-pieces and wedges dismounted from the LHC has been measured. A correlation between the Vickers hardness and the RRR of the high purity Cu profiles has been established. All U-pieces tested that were produced before 2009 have a RRR> 200, while the RRR of all wedges and of U-pieces of 2009 production have a much lower RRR. All tests of LHC main bus bar samples performed {{so far in the}} laboratory indicate a RRR of approximately 200 or higher...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the safety assessment of power cable splices connecting different sized 6 / 10 [kV] class power cables. To assess the safety, AC withstand voltage tests, partial discharge tests and impulse tests {{were carried out}} to the <b>cable</b> <b>splice</b> specimens and thermal rise due to overload and cross section of joint were examined as well. As a result, a breakdown due to the 4. 5 [U 0](27 [kV ac]) application could not found for 5 minutes. Under 1. 73 [U 0](10. 4 [kV ac]) application, partial discharges of 4 ～ 8 [pC] were detected. In impulse tests, all the specimens withstood to the standard waveforms of 75 [kV peak](1. 2 × 50 [㎲]) without any breakdowns. In addition, the temperature on the splice rose by 3 [℃] when the 200 [A] flew through the splice for 20 minutes, however the thermal rise of 3 [℃] was considered due to the atmospheric temperature.

40|$|As the {{high-voltage}} {{power cable}} insulation material growing worse, the aged insulation material can cause serious power supply problems. Most of the damages {{can be found}} in <b>cable</b> <b>splice</b> and cable terminators. This article mainly aims at developing the inspection methods for cable joints problem. We investigate the use of acoustic emission (AE) sensor, capacitive coupler (CC), and impulse current measurement methods to detect the electrical partial discharge (PD) signal in power cable. We analyze and compare the signals to find out the actual spot of the problem and to investigate and compare {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} different methods. To speak from the degree of sensibility, the impulse current method has the best sensibility, while the capacitive coupler and AE methods are less sensible. To speak from the noise-resist ability, it is contrary to the degree of sensibility. The impulse method is prone to be interrupted by noise. To speak from the PD signal source location ability, the AE method is better than the other two methods. 1...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{investigated}} the operational characteristics of spliced portable power cables. This research had a dual purpose: (1) {{to determine the}} thermal and mechanical performance of repaired trailing cables and compare them with undamaged cables and (2) to gauge the impact of long-term, localized heating on the insulating and jacketing materials contained in <b>cable</b> <b>splice</b> kits accepted or approved by the Mine Safety and Health Administration. The ranges of splice joint resistance and tensile breaking strength were determined from laboratory measurements. The choice of crimping tools affected {{the strength of the}} splice under tension. Thermal profiles of energized spliced cables were constructed, which showed that spliced conductor joints operated 5 to 2020 C hotter than the intact cable at rated currents. Accelerated life tests of thermally aged samples of splice kit insulation and jacket materials confirmed a deficiency in the thermal rating of the insulating tape. The recommendations in this report may be utilized to revise splice kit design, splice kit approval criteria, and trailing cable loading guidelines. Characterizing the thermal operating limits of spliced trailing cables may help to minimize the associated risks from explosions, fires, personnel burns, and shock...|$|E

Usually this shield is covered with a jacket. The shield acts as a Faraday cage to reduce electrical noise from affecting the signals, and to reduce electromagnetic radiation that may interfere with other devices.
