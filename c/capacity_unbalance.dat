50|$|If VSS is {{used for}} phase voltage {{unbalance}} elimination only, {{it is possible to}} operate it with a relatively low power. The VSS can effectively eliminate and control the phase voltage unbalance, which is caused by phase-to-ground <b>capacity</b> <b>unbalance.</b> The system enables to automatically maintain phase-to-ground <b>capacity</b> <b>unbalance</b> of the network in the range of assigned parameters, and thus provides the network with symmetrical phase voltage in the assigned range as well. In particular cases, the VSS can be used for artificial increase in phase voltage unbalance of the network, mostly for a short-time period during earth-fault localization in the network.|$|E
50|$|VSS {{systems have}} been {{installed}} in industrial 6 kV networks {{as well as in}} standard distribution networks up to 35 kV. Operational experience proved that VSS can eliminate even extremely high cross parameters unbalance in the network without negatively influencing the function of earth fault protection. Thanks to elimination of phase <b>capacity</b> <b>unbalance,</b> high reliability of directional ground protection can be reached even with high-resistance earth-faults. The possibility of operating the network with accurately compensated phase-to-earth capacity currents contributes to higher safety of the network operation.|$|E
5000|$|Voltage Symmetrization System (VSS) was {{developed}} especially for electric power networks with great phase voltage unbalance. It is a three-phase system which enables earth-fault current and charging current elimination. Until now, the operation with earth-fault current compensation {{has been very}} complicated for the networks with a great voltage unbalance. In the past, {{it was necessary to}} operate such networks with an isolated neutral, solid grounding or with a significantly untuned arc-suppression coil. VSS can also substitute for an arc-suppression coil or it can complement it parallelly. Moreover, it contributes to a better function of earth-fault protections for high-resistance earth faults by equalizing phase-to-earth <b>capacity</b> <b>unbalance.</b> The VSS was patented.The three-phase VSS has several basic functions: ...|$|E
50|$|As VSS {{does not}} require neutral for its connection, it can be {{connected}} anywhere in the network. At the same time, {{it is possible to}} adjust its power to a certain part of the network only, which can be use in local distribution networks or in long feeders, in feeders with high value of charging current, or in feeders with high <b>capacity</b> <b>unbalance.</b> The part of the network in which VSS is installed does not increase the value of phase-to-earth capacity current in power supply network. Furthermore, the value of networkâ€™s charging current decreases by the set system power. The VSS is very beneficial in networks with island operation. In island operation, the source is not loaded by charging current of the line and the separated island area is operated with resonant grounding. Such qualities cannot be reached with a classic arc-suppression coil.|$|E
