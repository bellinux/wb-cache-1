50|$|In {{the late}} 1940s {{it was taken}} over by a {{contractor}} who used the building as a garage for heavy road equipment, leveling the floor and opening up large garage doors through the walls to accommodate his needs. (Sometime during this period the original façade was demolished as well.) It then became a warehouse and a gift shop, and in 1959 the Gaslight Restaurant opened. The Gaslight is still remembered by some as a coveted fancy dining destination (and by others as the site of marvelous pyrotechnics courtesy of the inebriated gentleman whose job it was to light the outside gaslight).

40|$|In lithography, overlay {{control is}} getting {{increasingly}} complex. Advanced Process Control (APC) is introduced to minimize excursions {{from the process}} window for the present exposure. APC uses metrology data of previously exposed wafers, hence, {{there is always a}} delay of tens of minutes before the required information is available. This paper proposes the combination of a patterned expose beam and a patterned fluorescent marker on a wafer to generate a fluorescent signal that carries real-time information of the focus and/or position error of the expose pattern with the pattern on the wafer. A practical realization requires some changes to the exposure process, stepper design and reticle lay-out. Firstly, a matched pair of markers on the wafer and reticle is required. Secondly, the generated fluorescent signal must be measured, for example with a (spectrally filtered) photon <b>counter</b> <b>close</b> to the expose area of the wafer. At last, the markers from the previous lithography step shall, after development, be filled with fluorescent material. This deposition requires an additional process step. Photon budget calculations suggest an overlay measurement accuracy of less than a tenth of a nm (real-time) ...|$|R

40|$|The Beam Conditions and Radiation Monitoring System, BRM, is {{implemented}} in CMS {{to protect the}} detector and provide an interface to the LHC. Seven sub-systems monitor beam conditions and the radiation level inside the detector on different time scales. They detect adverse beam conditions, facilitate beam tuning close to CMS, and measure the doses accumulated in different detector components. Data are taken and analysed independently of the CMS data acquisition, displayed in the control room, and provide inputs to the trigger system and the LHC operators. In case of beam conditions dangerous to the CMS detector, a beam abort is induced. The Fast Beam Conditions Monitor, BCM 1 F, is a flux <b>counter</b> <b>close</b> to the beam pipe inside the tracker volume. It uses single-crystal CVD diamond sensors, radiation-hard FE electronics, and optical signal transmission to measure the beam halo as well as collision products bunch by bunch. The system has been operational during the initiatory runs of LHC in September 2008. It works reliably since the restart in 2009 and is invaluable to CMS for everyday LHC operation. A characterisation of the system {{on the basis of}} data collected during LHC operation is presented. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figures.

30|$|The TEMAC {{generated}} by the intellectual property (IP) core of Xilinx is used to process the data frames. It sends data frames to the GigE Tx and receives data frames from the GigE Rx. The MAC RxQ is similar with the MAC TxQ, which is just in a different transmission direction. When the MAC TxQ sends a data frame, a counter is opened; while the MAC RxQ finishes receiving that data frame, the above <b>counter</b> is <b>closed</b> by the MAC TxQ immediately. By their collaboration, the latency shown in Equation  2, which is accurate to the nanosecond, can be obtained.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Hamilton Fynes {{discovered}} that place of entertainment without difficulty, ordered for himself {{a cup of}} coffee and a sandwich, and drew a chair close up to the small open fire, taking care, however, to sit almost facing the only entrance to the room. He laid his hat upon the <b>counter,</b> <b>close</b> to which he had taken up his position, and smoothed back with his left hand his somewhat thick black hair. He was a man, apparently of middle age, of middle height, clean-shaven, with good but undistinguished features, dark eyes, very clear and very bright, which showed, indeed, but little need of the pince-nez which hung by a thin black cord from his neck. His hat, low in the crown and of soft gray felt, would alone have betrayed his nationality. His clothes, however, were also American in cut. His boots were narrow and of unmistakable shape. He ate his sandwich with suspicion, and after his first sip of coffee ordered a whiskey and soda. Afterwards he sat leaning back in his chair, glancing every now and then at the clock, but otherwise manifesting no signs of impatience. In less than half an hour an inspector, cap in hand, entered the room and announced that everything was ready. Mr. Hamilton Fynes put on his hat, picked up his suitcase, and followed him on to the platform. A long saloon carriage, with a guard's brake behind and an engine in front, was waiting there.|$|R
