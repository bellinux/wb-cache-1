2500|$|A {{scientific}} team {{coordinated by}} Paolo Forti, specialist of cave minerals and crystallographer at the University of Bologna (Italy) explored the cave {{in detail in}} 2006. To survive {{and to be able}} to work in the extreme temperature and humid conditions which prevent prolonged incursion in the <b>crystal</b> <b>chamber,</b> they developed their own refrigerated suits and cold breathing systems (respectively dubbed Tolomea suit and Sinusit respirator). Special caving overalls were fitted with a mattress of refrigerating tubes placed all over the body and connected to a backpack weighing about [...] containing a reservoir filled with cold water and ice. The cooling provided by melting ice was sufficient to provide about half an hour of autonomy.|$|E
60|$|That morning, {{and many}} mornings {{both before and}} afterwards, were spent by Laura at the New Hall {{examining}} the treasures of the museum, playing with the thousand costly toys which Raffles Haw had collected, or sallying out from the smoking-room in the <b>crystal</b> <b>chamber</b> into {{the long line of}} luxurious hot-houses. Haw would walk demurely beside her as she flitted from one thing to another like a butterfly among flowers, watching her {{out of the corner of}} his eyes, and taking a quiet pleasure in her delight. The only joy which his costly possessions had ever brought him was that which came from the entertainment of others.|$|E

These different houses are kept at varying degrees of heat and humidity so as to reproduce the exact climates of Egypt, China, and the rest. You see, our <b>crystal</b> <b>chamber</b> is a tramway running with a minimum of friction along a steel rod. By pulling this or that handle I regulate how far it shall go, and it travels, as you have seen, with amazing speed. The effect of my hot-houses is heightened by the roofs being invariably concealed by skies, which are really very admirably painted, and by the introduction of birds and other creatures, which seem to flourish quite as well in artificial as in natural heat. This explains the South American effect." ...|$|E
50|$|Raphides {{are found}} in {{specialized}} plant cells or <b>crystal</b> <b>chambers</b> called idioblasts. Electron micrographs have shown that raphide needle crystals are normally four sided or H-shaped (with a groove down both sides) or with a hexagonal cross section and some are barbed. Wattendorf (1976) suggested that all circular sectioned raphides, as visible in a light microscope, are probably hexagonal in cross section Microscopy using polarized light shows bright opalescence with raphides. Plants like Tradescantia pallida also accumulate calcium oxalate crystals in response to heavy metals stress.|$|R

40|$|Anatomical {{properties}} {{is necessary}} for wood species identification. This paper observes anatomical properties of six wood species originated from Papua. Wood species studied include: ketapang (Terminalia complanata K. Schum.); pala hutan (Gymnacranthera paniculata (A. DC.) Warb.); bipa (Pterygota horsfieldii (R. Br.) Kosterm).; kelumpang (Sterculia shillinglawii F. Muell.); manggis/kandis (Pentaphalangium parviflorum); and lancat/lebani (Mastixiodendron pachyclados (K. Schum) Melch.). Anatomical properties were observed according to IAWA (International Association of Wood Anatomists) checklist. The anatomical main properties observed in ketapang wood were vestured pits, prismatic crystals in non-chambered axial parenchyma cells, and druses. Pala hutan main anatomical properties were the presence of tannin tubes and oil cells which were associated with axial parenchyma. Prismatic crystals in axial parenchyma cells, and rays of two distinct sizes were two main anatomical characteristics of bipa and kelumpang wood. Prismatic <b>crystals</b> in <b>chambered</b> axial parenchyma cells was one of characteristics of manggis wood. Vestured pits and scanty paratracheal parenchyma were two main characteristics of lancat wood. For identification pur poses, bipa wood could be distinguished by banded parenchyma; polygonal alternate pits; and prismatic <b>crystals</b> in non- <b>chambered</b> axial parenchyma cells...|$|R

5000|$|Superman, {{unaware of}} Zod's {{release from the}} Phantom Zone and his {{subsequent}} rampage, decides to transform himself into a human and remove his super-powers by exposing himself to red Kryptonian sunlight in a <b>crystal</b> <b>chamber.</b> On {{their way back to}} Metropolis, Lois and Clark stop at a diner, where Clark gets beaten up by an obnoxious trucker and learns of Zod's conquest of the world. Realizing that humanity is helpless, Clark returns to the Fortress to reverse the transformation. Having anticipated this decision, Jor-El's artificial intelligence reveals it has been programmed to deal with this situation by sacrificing the remaining Kryptonian energy it needs to operate. To restore Clark's superpowers, it must be joined with him, making a reality of the Kryptonian prophecy concerning [...] "the father becoming the son" [...] and rendering the Fortress of Solitude inoperable.|$|E
50|$|The Daily Planet sends {{journalist}} Clark Kent—whose secret {{identity is}} Superman—and his colleague Lois Lane to Niagara Falls. Lois suspects Clark and Superman {{are the same}} person. That night, when Clarks recovers Lois' comb from a lit fireplace, Lois discovers that his hand is unburned, forcing Clark to admit he is Superman. He takes her to his Fortress of Solitude in the Arctic, and shows her the traces of his past stored in energy crystals. One is the green crystal that created the Fortress and opened Superman's contact with his parents. Superman declares his love for Lois and his wish to spend his life with her. After conferring with the artificial intelligence of his mother Lara, Superman removes his superpowers by exposing himself to red Kryptonian sunlight in a <b>crystal</b> <b>chamber,</b> becoming a mortal. Clark and Lois spend the night together, then leave the Fortress and return from the Arctic by automobile. Arriving at a diner in Metropolis, Clark is beaten up by a truck driver named Rocky.

50|$|Moseley {{participated in}} the design and {{development}} of early X-ray spectrometry equipment, learning some techniques from William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg at the University of Leeds, and developing others himself. Many of the techniques of X-ray spectroscopy were inspired by the methods that are used with visible light spectroscopes and spectrograms, by substituting <b>crystals,</b> ionization <b>chambers,</b> and photographic plates for their analogs in light spectroscopy. In some cases, Moseley found it necessary to modify his equipment to detect particularly soft frequency X-rays that could not penetrate either air or paper, by working with his instruments in a vacuum chamber.|$|R
50|$|The Skylab mission, {{launched}} in May 1973, {{served as a}} laboratory to perform various space manufacturing experiments. The station was equipped with a materials processing facility that included a multi-purpose electric furnace, a <b>crystal</b> growth <b>chamber,</b> and an electron beam gun. Among the experiments to be performed was research on molten metal processing; photographing the behavior of ignited materials in zero-gravity; crystal growth; processing of immiscible alloys; brazing of stainless steel tubes, electron beam welding, {{and the formation of}} spheres from molten metal.

40|$|Gross and {{anatomical}} {{features of}} Aromadendron elegans and seven lesser known wood species were observed and described for identification purposes and {{for evaluation of}} their suitable uses. Fiber dimension were also measured to evaluate their possible uses for pulp and paper. Several important features for identification were detected: 1) oil cells and closely spaced parenchyma bands in Aromadendron elegans; 2) wood semi-ring porous in Melia dubia; 3) radial intercellular canal and septate fibers in Lannea coromandelica; 4) ray storied and druses crystals in Hibiscus tiliaceus; 5) ray very high and contain sheath cells in Baccaurea sp.; 6) ray homocellular uniseriate and included phloem in Dolichandrone spathacea; 7) parenchyma aliform and confluent, prismatic <b>crystals</b> in <b>chambered</b> axial parenchyma of Acrocarpus fraxinifolius; 8) wood white, fibers with distinctly bordered pit, and prismatic <b>crystals</b> in <b>chambered</b> axial parenchyma of Flindersia australis. All wood species studied have density and considerable strength {{to be used for}} construction purposes. Aromadendron elegans, Melia dubia, and Flindersia australis have decorative appearance so they are suitable for furniture. Flindersia australis is white and has moderately fine texture so it could be usedfor "ram in" substitute. Fibers quality of all species studied belongs to quality class II. The total of fibers dimension derived values, of Aromadendron elegans, Melia dubia, Flindersia australis and Dolichandrone spathacea are the highest among eight wood species studied; further studies on pulping characteristics are therefore recommended for these wood species...|$|R
50|$|Lex Luthor {{escapes from}} prison with Eve Teschmacher's help, leaving his {{accomplice}} Otis behind. Luthor and Teschmacher infiltrate the Fortress of Solitude before Superman and Lois arrive. Luthor learns of Superman's connection to Jor-El and General Zod. He finds Zod at the White House {{and tells him}} Superman {{is the son of}} Jor-El, their jailer, and offers to lead him to Superman in exchange for control of Australia. The three Kryptonians ally with Luthor and go to the offices of the Daily Planet. Superman arrives, after having found the green crystal that restores his powers, and battles the three. Zod realizes Superman cares for the humans and takes advantage of this by threatening bystanders. Superman realizes the only way to stop Zod and the others is to lure them to the Fortress. Superman flies off, with Zod, Ursa, and Non in pursuit, kidnapping Lois and taking along Luthor. Upon arrival, Zod declares Luthor has outlived his usefulness and plans to kill both him and Superman. Superman tries to get Luthor to lure the three into the <b>crystal</b> <b>chamber</b> to depower them, but Luthor, eager to get back in Zod's favor, reveals the chamber's secret to the villains. Zod forces Superman into the chamber and activates it; however, Superman crushes Zod's hand and tosses him into a crevice. Luthor deduces that Superman reconfigured the chamber to expose the trio to red sunlight while Superman was protected from it. Non falls into another crevice and Lois knocks Ursa into a third. Superman flies back to civilization, returning Luthor to prison and Lois home.|$|E
40|$|The chorioid of the stingaree Dasyatis sabina {{contains}} {{large numbers}} of melanocytes and guanophores, the latter forming an oriented reflecting layer on the inner surface. The crystals contained in these cells have been chemically analyzed and consist of guanine (Nicol and Van Baalen, 1969). At deeper levels both kinds of cells are commingled, generally preserving their separate identities. Examining electron micrographs of these cells, however, we found several instances in which guanine crystals and melanocytes {{are present in the}} same cell (Figs. I and 2); such cells occur well within the oriented reflecting layer. Guanophores contain stacks of superposed crystal sacs, each enclosing a <b>crystal</b> <b>chamber</b> possessing a crystalline inclusion (Fig. 1).

40|$|Most {{angiosperms}} accumulate {{calcium oxalate}} crystals in defined patterns of crystal morphology and distribution. In grape (Vitis) needle-shaped crystals, called raphides, develop in intravacuolar membrane compartments, termed crystal chambers. We previously identified a cDNA, designated RAPS, which putatively encodes a <b>crystal</b> <b>chamber</b> protein in grape. RAP 3 encodes a chime c protein {{similar to the}} coehaperone Hip (Hsc 70 -interacting protein) and to thioredoxin in separate domains. Within the Hip domain tetratricopeptide repeats necessary for interaction with Hsc 70 are conserved. With immunoblot analysis we have detected both Hip and Hsc 70 in protein samples extracted from isolated grape raphides. The Arabidopsis genome contains two genes encoding Hip. One was similar to mammalian Hip, and the second {{was similar to the}} Hip/thioredoxin chimera in grape. All known Hip proteins contain a distinct acidic domain near the N-terminus. To determine whether this domain binds calcium, we assayed Hip proteins from grape and Arabidopsis for calcium binding. In all cases we found that full-length recombinant Hip bound calcium, whereas truncated Hip from which the acidic domain was deleted did not bind calcium. Our results show {{for the first time that}} Hip is a calcium-binding protein and that the acidic domain is necessary for calcium binding. Genetic and biochemical studies were pursued in Arabidopsis to gain additional information about potential functions of Hip in plants. RT-PCR analyses have shown that both Hip genes are ubiquitously expressed in Arabidopsis. Putative null mutants were isolated for one of the two Hip genes. Under certain conditions we have observed differences in growth of mutants compared to wild-type plants. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in Arabidopsis, using anti-Hsc 70 antibody to identify Hsc 70 interactions, did not reveal co-precipitation of Hip with Hsc 70, but this may require defined conditions not yet identified. Hsc 70 co-precipitated with numerous other proteins, including an ortholog of ycf 1, an ABC transporter controlling vacuolar partitioning of ions. This might reveal a role for Hsc 70 and its interacting proteins in regulating ion transport in plants. ...|$|E
