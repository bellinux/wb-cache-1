50|$|Decompression sickness, {{also called}} <b>caisson</b> workers' <b>disease</b> and the bends, {{is the most}} {{well-known}} complication of scuba diving. It occurs as divers ascend, and often from ascending too fast or without doing decompression stops. Bubbles are large enough and numerous enough to cause physical injury. It {{is quite possible that}} all divers have microbubbles in their blood to some extent, but that most of the time these bubbles are so few and so small that they cause no harm. When DCS occurs, bubbles disrupt tissues in the joints, brain, spinal cord, lungs, and other organs. Symptoms vary enormously. DCS may be as subtle as unusual tiredness after a dive, or an aching elbow, or a mottled skin rash. Or, it may present dramatically, with unconsciousness, seizures, paralysis, shortness of breath, or death. Paraplegia is not uncommon.|$|R
5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS; {{also known}} as divers' disease, the bends or <b>caisson</b> <b>disease)</b> describes a condition arising from dissolved gases coming out of solution into bubbles inside the body on depressurisation. DCS most commonly refers to problems arising from underwater diving decompression (i.e., during ascent), but may be experienced in other depressurisation events such as emerging from a caisson, flying in an unpressurised aircraft at altitude, and extravehicular activity from spacecraft. DCS and arterial gas embolism are collectively referred to as decompression illness.|$|E

50|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, as salvage {{operations}} became deeper and longer, an unexplained malady began afflicting the divers; they would suffer breathing difficulties, dizziness, joint pain and paralysis, sometimes leading to death. The problem was already well known among workers building tunnels and bridge footings operating under pressure in caissons and was initially called <b>caisson</b> <b>disease</b> but later the bends because the joint pain typically caused the sufferer to stoop.

5000|$|Construction {{workers who}} leave the {{pressurised}} {{environment of the}} caisson must decompress at a rate which allows symptom-free release of inert gases dissolved in the body tissues {{if they are to}} avoid decompression sickness, a condition first identified in caisson workers, and originally named [...] "Caisson disease" [...] in recognition of the occupational hazard. Construction of the Brooklyn Bridge, which was built with the help of pressurised caissons, resulted in numerous workers being either killed or permanently injured by <b>caisson</b> <b>disease</b> during its construction.

50|$|As noted above, further {{extension}} of the wet bell concept is the moon-pool-equipped underwater habitat, where divers may spend long periods in dry comfort while acclimated to the increased pressure experienced underwater. By not needing {{to return to the}} surface between excursions into the water, they can reduce the necessity for decompression (gradual reduction of pressure), after each excursion, required to avoid problems with nitrogen bubbles releasing from the bloodstream (the bends, also known as <b>caisson</b> <b>disease).</b> Such problems can occur at pressures greater than , corresponding to a depth of 6 m of water. Divers in an ambient pressure habitat will require decompression when they return to the surface. This is a form of saturation diving.|$|E
50|$|She saw {{at first}} hand the hideous dangers {{experienced}} by workers in the caissons, the compressed-air chambers used {{in the construction of}} bridges: 'descended the ladders rung by rung until we got on to the working floor, the sea and liquid mud being kept out entirely by air that was continuously pumped from above.' The appalling death and injury rate from <b>caisson</b> <b>disease</b> (also known as the bends or decompression sickness) prompted Ernest Moir to invent and implement a 'medical air lock' for the recompression and slow decompression of those workers who were overcome when they arrived on the surface. In the case of the Hudson River Tunnel, this reduced the annual death rate of workers from 25 to 1 per cent.|$|E
