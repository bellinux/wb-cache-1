Dit artikel is alleen beschikbaar in het Nederlands In dit artikel worden de resultaten beschreven van de ketenanalyse van de voetbalvandalismebestrijdingsketen volgens de standaard-methode van Keteninformatisering. De voetbalvandalismebestrijdingsketen heeft als doel om voetbalgerelateerd vandalisme en geweld te voorkomen. De huidige infrastructuur van deze keten kent een persoonsgerichte en event-gerichte benadering voor de aanpak van voetbalvandalisme en geweld. Uit onderzoek blijkt dat geweld steeds vaker buiten de stadions en voetbalwedstrijden plaatsvindt. Een keteninformatiesysteem kan mogelijk uitkomst bieden om ook in de toekomst goede beslissingen te kunnen nemen betreffende het voorkómen en bestrijden van voetbalgerelateerd vandalisme en geweld.  Op basis van een ketenanalyse kan (vooraf) de kans op succes van een keteninformatiesysteem worden bepaald. In het grondslagartikel van dit tijdschrift (Grijpink, 2010) wordt een theoretische en praktische introductie gegeven op de gebruikte methodologie van de ketenanalyse. De ketenanalyse van de voetbalvandalismebestrijdingsketen is onderdeel van het Ketenlandschaps-onderzoek aan het Departement Informatica van de Universiteit van Utrecht.  Volgens de uitgevoerde ketenanalyse is een keteninformatiesysteem voor de voetbalvandalismebestrijdingsketen noodzakelijk en op korte termijn haalbaar. Er is vergaande samenwerking in de keten en het personendeel van het Voetbal Volg Systeem (VVS) kan uitgroeien tot een volwaardig keteninformatiesysteem. Het informatiestrategie-advies luidt dan ook om stap voor stap toe te werken naar een keteninformatiesysteem met als inhoud identificerende gegevens van personen, een risicocode per persoon, en lopende maatregelen per persoon. Verder adviseren wij om het personendeel en het KNVB-deel van het VVS strikt gescheiden te houden om de opkomende ketenpositie van het personendeel van het VVS niet in gevaar te brengen.

40|$|The rapidly {{increasing}} number of cores available in multicore processors does not necessarily lead directly to a commensurate increase in performance: programs written in conventional languages such as C, need careful restructuring, preferably automatically, before the benefits {{can be observed in}} improved run-times. Even then, much depends upon the intrinsic capacity of the original program for concurrent execution. The subject of this study is the performance gains from the combined effect of the complementary techniques of the Decoupled Software Pipeline (DSWP) and (backward) slicing. DSWP extracts thread level parallelism from the body of a loop by breaking it into stages which are then executed pipeline style: in effect cutting across the <b>control</b> <b>chain.</b> Slicing, on the other hand, cuts the program along the <b>control</b> <b>chain,</b> teasing out finer threads that depend on different variables (or locations). parts that depend on different variables. The main contribution {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate that the application of DSWP, followed by slicing offers notable improvements over DSWP alone, especially when there is a loop-carried dependence that prevents the application of the simpler DOALL optimization.
