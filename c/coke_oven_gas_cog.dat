40|$|EN] The dry {{reforming}} of <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gases</b> (<b>COG)</b> over an {{activated carbon}} used as catalyst {{has been studied}} {{in order to produce}} a syngas suitable for methanol synthesis. The primary aim of this work was to study the influence of the high amount of hydrogen present in the COG on the process of dry reforming, as well as the influence of other operation conditions, such us temperature and volumetric hourly space velocity (VHSV). It was found that the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction takes place due to the hydrogen present in the COG, and that its influence on the process increases as the temperature decreases. This situation may give rise to the consumption of the hydrogen present in the COG, and the consequent formation of a syngas which is inappropriate for the synthesis of methanol. This reaction can be avoided by working at high temperatures (about 1000 °C) in order to produce a syngas that is suitable for methanol synthesis. It was also found that the RWGS reaction is favoured by an increase in the VHSV. In addition, the active carbon FY 5 was proven to be an adequate catalyst for the production of syngas from COG.

Global warming caused by an increased concentration of greenhouse gases is of major concern today. It is predicted that global warming will cause sea level rise and other environmental impacts that may harm humans and nature. The significant increase of greenhouse gases over the last 200 years is almost entirely due to human activities and particularly due to combustion of fossil fuels. By using biomass as fuel for production of methanol as motor fuel, it would contribute to decrease the total green house gas emission level. The <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gas</b> which origins from fossil based coal, {{could be used in}} a better manner as fuel for methanol production than for increase the present electricity production at LULEKRAFT AB (LUKAB). That is because the methanol production leads to a product with lower specific CO 2 emissions due to that the conversion- and total plant efficiency are much higher. The wood-pellets produced from sawdust at Bioenergi are to a large extent exported from the county to heat and power plants, which purchase the pellets to a low price. A better option would be to use the sawdust for methanol production, which would be more profitable and could be used within the county and thereby also minimize the transportation costs and green house gas emissions. The conclusion is that methanol produced from 400 GWh <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gas</b> would have a production cost in the range of 1, 20 - 2, 44 SEK/litre. Methanol produced from both 420 GWh sawdust and the <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gas</b> would result in a production cost in the range of 1, 20 - 2, 70 SEK/litre. The minimum methanol sale price was calculated via a fuel value analysis which analyzed the fuel input value within the MEOH plant, LUKAB and Bioenergi. The methanol produced from the <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gas</b> would have a minimum sale price in the range of 1, 20 - 2, 68 SEK/litre.

The utilization of these by-product fuels reduces the waste gas emissions at the steel mill and reduces the requirements for outside fuel sources. However, as with primary fuel sources, the combustion of these by-product fuel blends does produce hazardous pollutants, in particular nitrogen oxides, and because these are atypical fuel blends of varying composition, the pollutant formation is not well understood. The objective {{of this research was}} to develop an understanding of the mechanisms controlling NO{sub x} formation from the combustion of by-product fuels from the steel industry and investigate control and design options to minimize emissions. The minimization strategies investigated were constrained by limits on CO and hydrocarbon emissions, both of which increased under fuel-rich combustion scenarios that resulted in reduced NO{sub x} emissions. Also, the minimization strategies were constrained by the need for reasonable heat generation rates in the furnaces that employ these by-product fuels, so that product steel quality is not adversely affected...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of Carbon Footprint (CF) for technology of hydrogen production from cleaned <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gas</b> was performed. On {{the basis of}} real data and simulation calculations of the production process of hydrogen from coke gas, emission indicators of carbon dioxide (CF) were calculated. These indicators are associated with net production of electricity and thermal energy and direct emission of carbon dioxide throughout a whole product life cycle. Product life cycle includes: coal extraction and its transportation to a coking plant, the process of coking coal, purification and reforming of <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gas,</b> carbon capture and storage. The values were related to 1 Mg of coking blend and to 1 Mg of the hydrogen produced. The calculation {{is based on the}} configuration of hydrogen production from <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gas</b> for coking technology available on a commercial scale that uses a technology of coke dry quenching (CDQ). The calculations were made using ChemCAD v. 6. 0. 2 simulator for a steady state of technological process. The {{analysis of}} carbon footprint was conducted in accordance with the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) ...|$|R
40|$|A novel slag carbon {{arrestor}} process (SCAP) {{was proposed}} to improve the heat recovery in energy-intensive steelmaking process, which typically has a low heat recovery. The proposed SCAP process introduces a tar reformer to utilise the slag - a by-product from steelmaking process - as the catalyst to convert <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gas</b> and tar into hydrogen-enriched fuel gas. This is achieved by making use of the valuable carbon and/or energy contained in the <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gas,</b> which otherwise being wasted, to assist in tar reforming and produce hydrogen-enriched gas. Such concept is expected to reduce the undesired tar formation in steelmaking process along with improved heat recovery efficiency and higher quality <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gas</b> production. Both simulation and experimental studies on the slag carbon arrestor process were performed. The preliminary thermodynamic analysis carried out using Aspen Plus v 8. 4 indicates that with the tar reformer the energy content of <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gas</b> was found increased from ~ 34. 6 MJ/kg to ~ 37. 7 MJ/kg (or by 9 %). Also, with the utilisation of carbon deposition on the slag, a reduction of up to 12. 8 % coke usage in the steelmaking process can be achieved. This corresponds to an energy saving of 4 % and a carbon emission reduction of 5. 7 % compared with the conventional steelmaking process. Preliminary experimental TGA-FTIR investigations revealed {{a reduction in the}} aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon groups and an increase in the production of CO 2 and CO, attributed to the tar cracking abilities of slag...|$|R
