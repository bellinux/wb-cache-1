40|$|Why certain {{species of}} fish become {{invasive}} is poorly understood and a key obstacle to restoring many of the world’s ecosystems. In this study we tested whether variation in biotic resistance exerted by native predators might explain the reproductive success of the common carp, a large and fecund invasive species that typically spawns in outlying and unstable shallow habitat. An initial three-year study of the relative abundance of youngof- year (YOY) carp in interconnected lakes in the Upper Mississippi River Basin discovered that YOY <b>carp</b> are <b>only</b> found in shallow waters that experience winter hypoxia (winterkill) and have low densities of the native egg-predators that otherwise dominate these locales.

It found that while carp eggs survived in winterkill lakes, they only survived in non-winterkill lakes when protected by a mesh that excluded fish. Large numbers of carp eggs {{were found in the}} stomachs of native fish inhabiting lakes that did not winterkill.

40|$|Predator-prey {{interactions}} are a primary structuring force in aquatic systems. A {{change in the}} predator-prey interactions may cause {{a change in the}} strength of trophic cascades and even resulting in ecosystem shifts. However, individual properties of predators and prey, as well as environmental conditions, may affect the relative strength of predator-prey interactions. In our studies we observed two different behavioural defences against predators. Both crucian carp and perch decreased their activity when exposed to pike chemical or visual cue. However, the behavioural response elicited by the chemical cue was context dependent, i. e. crucian <b>carp</b> <b>only</b> reacted to the cue if information from visual senses was limited (turbid or brown water). Another behavioural response to predation threat is schooling as shown in roach, a common prey fish, that group into schools to limit predation risk. The interaction between the predator and prey fish was influenced by optical conditions. Reaction distance of pike showed to be negatively affected by reduced visual conditions. The reaction distance and attack distance of pike and escape distance of roach was also context dependent, where brown water increased the reaction and attack distance in pike and reduced the escape distance in roach. This resulted in an overlap in attack and escape distance, which may have positive effects on the capture success of pike. Pikeperch was less affected by changes of the visual conditions in the water. However, pikeperch was indirectly affected by changing optical conditions through a change in prey behaviour. Pikeperch showed a strong preference for perch under good optical conditions, but shifted their food preference to roach in poor optical conditions. The underlying mechanism to this pattern was observed in behavioural studies. Roach escaped long before the pikeperch initiated an attack, whereas perch was inactive which allowed pikeperch to approach and successfully attack. In poor optical conditions roach shoals were splitting up and roach escape distance was strongly reduced, which increased the foraging success of pikeperch resulting in that both roach and perch were included in the diet. These changes in the predator-prey interactions may explain some of the changes in fish growth rate observed in lakes along a gradient of brown colouration. Here, I found that the growth rate of pike and roach were reduced in browner lakes. Changes in environmental drivers, such as eutrophication and brownification, affecting the optical climate should thus have consequences for the strength of predator-prey interactions. This in turn may affect lake ecosystems through higher-order interactions...|$|R

In Pakistan, the fish fauna is rich but only seven warm water species and two cold water species are cultivated on a commercial scale. Aquaculture has also received {{a substantial amount of}} government investment, and facilities are now in place that can provide the basis for a major future expansion. With the exception of trout culture in the northern regions, virtually all aquaculture consists of pond culture of various carp species.|$|R
40|$|Asian carp {{refers to}} four {{different}} species: the bighead, silver, black, and grass carp. Although {{they are not}} yet breeding in Pennsylvania waters, there is great concern that Asian carp could become a dominant fish in the Commonwealth’s lakes and rivers. Species Description Several species of Asian carp can grow to weigh over 100 pounds and reach four to five feet in length. The bighead and silver carp have broad, laterally compressed bodies with small scales and large terminal mouths that lack teeth. The grass and black carp have larger scales and more slender bodies. The black <b>carp</b> is the <b>only</b> species with molar-like teeth arranged in rows of four to five. All four species lack barbels around the mouth...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{common carp}} (Cyprinus carpio) is an {{important}} aquaculture fish worldwide but only limited single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers are characterized from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in this species. In this study, 1487 putative SNPs were bioinformatically mined from 14, 066 online ESTs mainly from the European common carp, with the occurrence rate of about one SNP every 173 bp. One hundred and twenty-one of these SNPs were selected for validation using PCR fragment sequencing, and 48 out of 81 primers could amplify the expected fragments in the Chinese common <b>carp</b> genome. <b>Only</b> 26 (21. 5 %) putative SNPs were validated, however, 508 new SNPs and 68 indels were identified. The ratios of transitions to transversions were 1. 77 for exon SNPs and 1. 05 for intron SNPs. All the 23 SNPs selected for population tests were polymorphic, with the observed heterozygosity (Ho) ranging from 0. 053 to 0. 526 (mean 0. 262), polymorphism information content (PIC) from 0. 095 to 0. 357 (mean 0. 246), and 21 SNPs were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. These results suggest that different common carp populations with geographic isolation have significant genetic variation at the SNP level, and these new EST-SNP markers are readily available for genetics and breeding studies i...|$|R
5000|$|This fish is {{a popular}} {{delicacy}} in Southeast Asia, {{but because they are}} so rare they are very expensive. They are usually sold for RM1,000. Due to its cost, the Jullien's golden <b>carp</b> is <b>only</b> commercially served in a select few restaurants in Southeast Asia, specifically in Malaysia and Myanmar. This contributes to the illegal fishing of these fish in prohibited, conservation areas. The problem is that, although these fish can be bought more cheaply and readily from aqua fisheries, wild caught ones are more in demand. Recently, the opening up of countries like Myanmar and the subsequent increase in tourism has led to an increased “exotic food enthusiast” market in Southeast Asia. This market encourages local fisherman to go into the red zone, an area of wildlife conservation where the public is only allowed to engage in small-scale fishing. However, the Burmese government stated in March, 2014 that the Jullien’s golden carp’s special protection program makes fishing for them from February to April illegal. However, other times of the year the regulations surrounding the fishing, capturing, and selling of fish such as the Jullien’s golden carp are much more relaxed. This has made the overfishing of the Jullien’s golden carp both easy and common.|$|R
40|$|Recently {{accumulated}} knowledge allows more precise {{comparison of the}} structural (and possibly evolutionary) relationships of several different animal rhabdoviruses: vesicular stomatitis virus, rabies virus, Kern Canyon virus, and spring viremia of carp virus. Each virus is composed primarily of a glycoprotein, an RNA-associated nucleoprotein, {{and one or two}} membrane proteins. Vesicular stomatitis virus group viruses contain lesser amounts of two additional distinct polypeptides, NS and L. The separate viruses undergo structural polypeptide phosphorylation in vivo according to characteristic patterns. In vesicular stomatitis virus the NS protein is selectively phosphorylated. In rabies group viruses and in spring viremia of carp virus, the nucleoprotein is the predominant phosphoprotein; in these viruses only the phosphorylated moiety is selectively cleaved off with trypsin. In Kern Canyon virus, only membrane protein and glycoprotein are weakly phosphorylated. Each virus possesses a virion-bound protein kinase. Vesicular stomatitis virus group viruses, Kern Canyon virus, and spring viremia of <b>carp</b> virus <b>only</b> contain virion-bound transcriptases of respectively decreasing levels of activity demonstrable in vitro. Vesicular stomatitis and Kern Canyon viruses replicate efficiently in enucleated cells; rabies virus does not. Based upon these observations, it is suggested that vesicular stomatitis virus may represent the most highly evolved of these rhabdoviruses, whereas spring viremia of carp and Kern Canyon viruses may represent "evolutionary links" between the vesicular stomatitis and rabies virus groups...|$|R
