40|$|Dialeurodes citri (Hom. Aleyrodidae) first invaded citrus {{orchards}} in the South Adriatic, near Dubrovnik, during 1977. Since {{the characteristics}} of the pest have not been studied in Croatia, this paper reviews its morphology, locations, host plant range and biology. Leaf samples, collected all over the Croatian coast and islands, were observed in the laboratory for purpose of creating a map with <b>citrus</b> <b>whitefly</b> locations, morphological description and a list of host plants. The pest biological cycle and population trend were investigated in the region of Split (May 1996 -May 1998). The presence of <b>citrus</b> <b>whitefly</b> was confirmed in all citrus-growing areas of Croatia. The number of noted host plants was somewhat lower than in Mediterranean countries. Other than citrus, it also colonised and harmed laurustinus (Viburnum tinus Hemsl.), persimmon (Diospyros kaki Thunb.) and several plants of Oleaceae. The <b>citrus</b> <b>whitefly</b> had three generations on citrus per year. However, the part of larval population that belonged to second generation did not finish the post-embryonic development and it remained on the summer flush leaves and awaited the hibernation. The appearance of adults followed the appearance of young citrus growth. All development stages had three population peaks during vegetation period. The presence of young larval stages (L- 1, L- 2) was pronounced during the middle of June, August and October. The pest overwintered mainly as fourth instar larva. On deciduous persimmon trees it had two generations per year...|$|E
30|$|A {{group of}} predators was found {{associated}} with the scale insects on citrus. Among the predaceous insects, the two coccinellids, Chilochorus bipustulatus L. and Scymnus syriacus March, were reported by Tawfik et al. (1970) (for C. ficus) and Mahmoud (1981) for A. aurantii and L. beckii. The former predator was considered by both authors as the most efficient. Metwally et al. (1999) at Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate (northern Egypt) studied seasonal abundance of the coccinellid predator, Clitostethus arcuatus (Rossi). This predator accounted 41.9 % {{of the total number}} of predators found {{associated with the}} <b>citrus</b> <b>whitefly</b> Dialeurodes citri (Ashm.) on citrus trees, where a mean number of the predator reached 15 individuals/ 80 double net-strokes, as described.|$|E
40|$|Today, the <b>Citrus</b> <b>whitefly,</b> Dialeurodes citri (Ashmead), {{is a very}} {{important}} pest on all Citrus species throughout the citrus growing areas in Croatia. It causes direct damage by sucking the plant juice from the leaves. Furthermore, immatures excrete honeydew that stimulates sooy mold. The presence of sooty mold on contaminated leaves interferes with the photosynthesis of plants. Citrus fruits coated by sooty mold lose its market value. Because Dialeurodes citri is poorly known in Croatia, this paper presents review of it's morphology, biology, ecology, distribution and control measures applied in the world. Two other serious citrus pest from the family Aleyrodidae, Aleurothrixus floccosus (Maskell) and Parabemisia myricae (Kuwana), that are domesticated in nearly all countries of Mediterranean Basin are not recorded in Croatia yet. There is a possibility that these pests could be introduced in Croatia, especially by importing of host plant seedlings. For their proper identification, their morphological and biological differences from Dialeurodes citri are given...|$|E

40|$|The entomopathogenic {{fungus genus}} Aschersonia (Deuteromycotina: Hyphomycetes) is host {{specific}} to some aleyrodids and scale insects. In {{search of the}} Thai endemic species, fungus samples were isolated from cadavers of <b>citrus</b> <b>whiteflies</b> (Aleyrodes tabaci Gennadius) found in citrus orchards in Trat province, Thailand. After morphological analysis and scanning electron microscopic examination, it was identified as Aschersonia placenta Berkeley and Broom. Seven synthetic media, namely: potato dextrose agar (PDA), PDA with pasteurized milk (Foremost®) (PDA + M), Sabouraud dextrose agar with yeast extract (SDAY), SDA with pasteurized milk (Foremost®) (SDA + M), corn meal agar (CMA), water agar with juice of eight vegetable species (V 8 ®) (WA + V 8) and WA were explored as appropriate media for fungal cultivation. SDAY and SDA + M gave the best colony radial growth, producing 2. 04  ±  0. 13  cm and 2. 09  ±  0. 10  cm in 21  d, respectively. However, based {{on the ability of}} A. placenta to produce conidia, PDA and SDAY which produced 2. 59  ×  108 conidia/mL and 2. 69  ×  108 conidia/mL, respectively, were considered as the most suitable media for this fungal species. The efficiency assessment of A. placenta for controlling black parlatoria (Parlatoria ziziphi (Lucas)), indicated that a conidial suspension at 1  ×  109 conidia/mL gave 23. 73 % and 27. 42 % mortality at 14 and 21  d post inoculation, respectively...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we sequenced the {{complete}} mitochondrial genome (15, 220 bp) of the <b>citrus</b> spiny <b>whitefly,</b> Aleurocanthus spiniferus (Quaintance), a well-known pest from the superfamily Aleyrodidae. The A. spiniferus mitogenome contains 36 genes, including 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 21 transfer RNAs (tRNA), two ribosomal RNAs (rRNA) {{and a large}} non-coding region (control region, CR). Like most whiteflies, the A. spiniferus mitogenome had a large degree of rearrangement due to translocation of the nad 3 -trnG-cox 3 gene cluster. The 13 PCGs initiated with ATN and generally terminated with TAA, although some used TAG or T as stop codons; atp 6 showed the highest evolutionary rate, whereas cox 2 appeared to have the lowest rate. The A. spiniferus mitogenome had 21 tRNAs with a typical cloverleaf secondary structure composed of four arms. Modeling of the two rRNA genes indicated that their secondary structure {{was similar to that}} of other insects. The CR of A. spiniferus was 920 bp and mapped between the nad 3 -trnG-cox 3 and trnI-trnM gene clusters. One potential stem-loop structure and five tandem repeats were identified in the CR. Phylogenetic relationships of 11 species from the Aleyrodidae were analyzed based on the deduced amino acid sequences of the 13 PCGs and evolutionary characteristics were explored. Species with more genetic rearrangements were generally more evolved within the Aleyrodidae...|$|R
40|$|Australian <b>citrus</b> <b>whitefly</b> (ACWF) {{was first}} {{detected}} in Auckland in 2000. It has since spread to Kerikeri, Gisborne and Bay of Plenty, where it causes sooty mould problems and possibly reduction in fruit colour and tree health issues. The seasonal phenology of ACWF life stages and presence of natural enemies were assessed in citrus orchards in Kerikeri, Auckland and Gisborne. ACWF overwintered as a fourth instar/pupal stage. In Kerikeri and Auckland, the main adult emergence period was mid-October to January, with distinct periods when each immature life stage was present. In March, {{a small percentage}} of the fourth instar/pupal population emerged as adults, while the remainder overwintered before emerging the following spring. Clear and distinct periods when eggs, crawlers and nymphal stages were present were not seen in Gisborne. No parasitoids emerged from sampled ACWF and none of the predators collected in this survey appeared have any significant impact on the high ACWF populations observed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The recent invader Australian <b>citrus</b> <b>whitefly</b> (ACW) {{is causing}} severe sooty mould {{problems}} on citrus varieties throughout Northland, Auckland, Bay of Plenty, Gisborne and Hawke’s Bay. Five insecticide programmes {{were applied to}} two orchards in Kerikeri and two orchards in Gisborne. Four programmes used foliar insecticide targeting adults in November 2009 (pymetrozine, diazinon, polyether modified polysiloxane or pyrethrin) followed by another targeting crawlers/young instars in December (spirotetramat, buprofezin, mineral oil or pyrethrin, respectively). The fifth programme was a single soil drench of imidacloprid in November. Reductions in ACW populations were achieved on trees treated with pymetrozine, then spirotetramat, diazinon then buprofezin or polyether modified polysiloxane, then mineral oil. These reductions were greater than those observed on untreated trees, pyrethrin-treated trees or imidacloprid-treated trees. Sooty mould on fruit and foliage was reduced with pymetrozine/spirotetramat, diazinon/buprofezin or polyether modified polysiloxane/mineral oil treatments at the sites where sooty mould was severe on untreated trees...|$|E
