5|$|Reformed theologians believe sacraments to be instituted in {{the context}} of <b>covenants</b> between God and people. They believe that when God makes <b>covenants,</b> he {{provides}} physical signs associated with the covenant. Old Testament covenant signs include the rainbow which appeared following a covenant made with Noah. Circumcision is believed to be a sign of God's covenant with Abraham and his descendants. Such signs entail blessings and sanctions on those with whom God <b>covenants.</b> In the New Testament period there are two such signs or sacraments: baptism and the Lord's Supper.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{supporters}} of infant baptism argue that circumcision is {{the sign of}} the <b>covenant</b> God made with Abraham and should be received by all the members of his <b>covenant.</b> The children of members of Abraham's <b>covenant</b> are themselves members of Abraham's <b>covenant.</b> Christians are members of Abraham's <b>covenant</b> [...] Therefore, the children of Christians are members of Abraham's <b>covenant.</b> Since baptism is the New Testament form of circumcision, the children of Christians should receive {{the sign of the}} <b>covenant</b> by being baptised.|$|R
5000|$|Other commentators, such as Douglas Van Dorn, {{recognize}} a separate priestly <b>covenant,</b> {{independent of the}} Mosaic <b>covenant</b> (which he takes as a prophetic <b>covenant).</b> In taken with the Davidic (kingly) <b>covenant,</b> this represents the three offices of Christ. Van Dorn argues this case {{on the basis of}} Nehemiah 13:29 which refers to [...] "the <b>covenant</b> of the priesthood and the Levites", Malachi 2:8 who speaks of [...] "the <b>covenant</b> of Levi," [...] and Jeremiah 33:21 who points to the [...] "covenant with the Levitical priests."

5|$|Earnings {{management}} {{involves the}} manipulation of company earnings towards a pre-determined target. This target can be motivated by a preference for more stable earnings, in which case management {{is said to be}} carrying out income smoothing.

Other possible motivations for earnings management include the need to maintain the levels of certain accounting ratios due to debt <b>covenants,</b> and the pressure to maintain increasing earnings and to beat analyst targets.|$|E

5|$|In July 1893 {{a peasant}} conference at Corleone drafted model agrarian {{contracts}} for labourers, sharecroppers and tenants and presented {{them to the}} landowners. When those refused to negotiate, a strike against landowners and against state taxes broke out over {{a large part of}} western Sicily. The so-called Patti di Corleone (Corleone <b>Covenants),</b> are considered by historians to be the first trade union collective contract in capitalist Italy. In September the state authorities intervened and some of the landowners were persuaded to capitulate. Elsewhere the strike continued until November 1893. Railwaymen of Catania and Palermo, the sulphur-miners and many other workers followed their example winning higher wages or better working conditions.|$|E

Accused by Zamoyski of breaking his <b>covenants,</b> Sigismund III was humiliated during the sejm of 1592, which deepened his resentment of szlachta. Sigismund was bent on strengthening {{the power of the}} monarchy and Counter-Reformational promotion of the Catholic Church (Piotr Skarga was among his supporters). Indifferent to the increasingly common breaches of the Warsaw Confederation religious protections and instances of violence against the Protestants, the King was opposed by religious minorities.|$|E

5|$|Although St. Louis {{enforced}} {{a variety}} of Jim Crow laws, the area generally had {{a lower level of}} racial violence and fewer lynchings than the American South. The St. Louis black community was stable and relatively concentrated along the riverfront or near the railroad yards. Although informal discrimination had existed in the St. Louis housing market {{since the end of the}} Civil War, only in 1916 did St. Louis pass a residential segregation ordinance. The ordinance quickly was invalidated by court injunctions, but private restrictive <b>covenants</b> in St. Louis real estate transactions limited the ability of white owners to sell to blacks and were another form of racial discrimination. In 1948 the U.S. Supreme Court overturned such real estate limitations as unconstitutional in Shelley v. Kraemer, a court case based on the sale of a St. Louis house (the Shelley House) to a black family.|$|E

5|$|Huldrych Zwingli, the {{earliest}} theologian {{considered part of}} the Reformed tradition, was vigorously opposed to worship practices he believed to be based on tradition rather than the Bible. Nevertheless, he disagreed with Anabaptists, who refused to baptize their children on scriptural grounds. Through his arguments with Anabaptists, Zwingli arrived at the position that baptism was a sign of the covenant between God and his people, but that it did not convey grace to the baptized. He saw baptism as essentially identical to the circumcision of Israelites in the Old Testament in this respect, and used this idea in polemics against Anabaptists. Zwingli's emphasis on baptism as a pledge or oath was to prove unique in the Reformed tradition. Heinrich Bullinger, Zwingli's successor, continued the teaching of the continuity of God's <b>covenants</b> and circumcision with baptism. Bullinger also emphasized that baptism indicates duties to the baptized in response to God's grace.|$|E
5|$|Though Houston is {{the largest}} city in the United States without formal zoning regulations, it has {{developed}} similarly to other Sun Belt cities because the city's land use regulations and legal <b>covenants</b> have played a similar role. Regulations include mandatory lot size for single-family houses and requirements that parking be available to tenants and customers. Such restrictions have had mixed results. Though some have blamed the city's low density, urban sprawl, and lack of pedestrian-friendliness on these policies, the city's land use has also been credited with having significant affordable housing, sparing Houston the worst effects of the 2008 real estate crisis. The city issued 42,697 building permits in 2008 and was ranked first {{in the list of}} healthiest housing markets for 2009.|$|E

5|$|After the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, Scotland regained its kirk, {{but also}} the bishops. Under the Rescissory Act 1661, {{legislation}} was revoked back to 1633, removing the Covenanter gains of the Bishops' Wars. But an act passed later the same day renewed the discipline of kirk sessions, presbyteries and synods, suggesting that a compromise was possible. The restoration of episcopacy was proclaimed by the Privy Council of Scotland on 6 September 1661. James Sharp, minister of Crail, who was in London to represent {{the interests of the}} Resolutioners, changed sides and accepted the position of Archbishop of St. Andrews. He was consecrated along with Robert Leighton as Bishop of Dunblane and two other bishops. Soon an entire bench of bishops had been constructed. During the parliamentary session of 1662 the Church of Scotland was restored as the national church and all office-holders were required to renounce the <b>Covenants.</b> Church ministers were forced to accept the new situation or lose their livings. Up to a third, at least 270, of the ministry refused. Many ministers chose voluntarily to abandon their own parishes rather than wait to be forced out by the government. Most of the vacancies occurred in the south-west of Scotland, an area particularly strong in its Covenanting sympathies. Some of the ministers also took to preaching in the open fields in conventicles, often attracting thousands of worshippers.|$|E
5|$|Covenant {{theology}} is an interpretive framework used by Reformed theologians which was significantly {{developed during the}} seventeenth century. Under this scheme, as articulated by the Assembly, God's dealings with men are {{described in terms of}} two covenants: the covenant of works and covenant of grace. The Westminster Confession was the first major Reformed symbol to explicitly mention the covenant of works (sometimes called the covenant of life), in which God offered Adam eternal life on condition of perfect obedience. In the fall of man, Adam broke the covenant of works by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. To remedy this, God offered salvation apart from human initiative in what was called the covenant of grace. This covenant allowed man to enjoy eternal life despite his inability to obey God's law perfectly. The idea of the covenant of grace was a much more common feature of orthodox Reformed theology. The Westminster divines set these two <b>covenants</b> against each other as the two major ways in which God deals with people.|$|E
