25|$|European earwigs {{spend the}} day time in cool, dark, {{inaccessible}} places such as flowers, fruits, and wood crevices. Active primarily at night, they seek out food ranging from plant matter to small insects. Though they are omnivorous, they are considered scavengers rather than predators. Often they consume plant matter, though they have also been known to feed on aphids, spiders, insect eggs, and dead plants and insects, among other things. Their favorite plants include the common <b>crucifer</b> Sisymbrium officinale, the white clover Trifolium repens, and the dahlia Dahlia variabilis. They also like to feed on molasses, {{as well as on}} nonvascular plants, lichens and algae. They prefer meat or sugar to natural plant material even though plants are a major natural food source. European earwigs prefer aphids to plant material such as leaves and fruit slices of apple, cherry and pear. Adults eat more insects than do nymphs.|$|E

40|$|The {{extent of}} recent {{additions}} of sulphur from fertilizers and atmospheric pollution to British soils is pointed out. Gymnosperms are especially sensitive to sulphur pollution, while <b>crucifers</b> {{and some other}} plants are unusually tolerant. It {{is possible that the}} diminution of some species, such as Juniperus communis, in Britain is a result of atmospheric pollution, as is the spread of many <b>crucifers</b> such as Cardaria draba. The distribution maps of many alien <b>crucifers</b> can be correlated with a map of sulphur dioxide pollution. Many native <b>crucifers</b> restricted to coastal habitats may be so restricted because their requirement for sulphur is satisfied by sea-spray. Sulphur is a common element in the soil which is essential for the growth of plants. During the present century the amount of sulphur in British soils and plants has increased, partly from the use of fertilizers, but more substantially from pollution of the atmosphere. The present note attempts to correlate some recent changes in the distribution of plants with sulphur pollution in Britain, and suggests that further studies of the problem should be made.

Since the {{promulgation}} of the 1962 Missal, which lists under six headings the occasions when the Last Gospel is omitted, the only passage used, {{with the exception of}} Palm Sunday, is John 1:1-14, in the recitation of which all genuflect at [...] "Et Verbum caro factum est".

[...] When earlier editions of the Roman Missal were in use, a Last Gospel was read at every Mass, usually John 1:1-14. When there were two coinciding liturgical days (feasts, ferias or vigils) that each had a proper Gospel (one not found in the common Masses used for the various categories of saints' feast days, such as [...] "common of confessors"), the Gospel appointed for the liturgical day being commemorated was read as the Last Gospel, just as the collect, secret, and postcommunion prayers are commemorated for that day.
