Even in an organ with common cell types, such as hepatocytes within the liver, the population of cells may respond with different sensitivities for injury or for biochemical responses to toxicants. In the liver, many tumor promoters induce cytochrome P 450 enzymes and other proteins in centrilobular cells at much lower doses than required to cause induction in periportal cells. In addition, these induction responses appear to occur at the level of individual cells—a 50 % response of the liver for induction does not represent 50 % induction in all cells. Instead, half of the cells are fully induced and half are unaffected. Cells “switch ” from one phenotypic state to another. Over the past 10 years, several attempts have been made to model these <b>cellular</b> <b>switches</b> and to understand their relevance for hepatic tumor promotion and risk assessment. The data used for analyzing these switches include responses of the entire liver (total induction), responses of individual cells in the liver (regional induction), and cellular responses such as proliferation and apoptosis.

Classical hallmarks of aging cell include increasing levels of reactive oxygen species, DNA damage and senescence entry, which disrupt tissue architecture and function.

In this perspective, we briefly comment recent progress of Leontieva and colleagues showing a new class of non-rapalog drugs that target simultaneously mTORC 1 and mTORC 2 and prevent geroconversion in a more efficient way than rapamycin.

Objective: To investigate the role of neutrophils and their granule contents in the adhesion of monocyte subpopulations in acute inflammation. Methods and Results: Here, we show that neutrophil-derived cathelicidins (human: LL 37, mouse: CRAMP) induce adhesion of classical monocytes but not of nonclassical monocytes in the mouse cremaster muscle and in in vitro flow chamber assays. CRAMP is released from emigrated neutrophils and then transported across the endothelium, where it is presented to rolling leukocytes. Endothelial-bound cathelicidin activates formyl-peptide receptor 2 on classical monocytes, resulting in monocytic β 1 - and β 2 -integrin conformational change toward an extended, active conformation that allows for adhesion to their respective ligands, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1.

The EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) that occurs during normal development and malignant progression {{is a typical}} example of the phenotypic switch associated with profound actin remodelling and changes in gene expression. For instance, actin dynamics control motile cell functions in EMT, in part, through regulating the subcellular localization of the myocardin-related transcription factor MKL 1 (megakaryoblastic leukaemia translocation 1), a co-activator of SRF (serum-responsive factor). In the present paper, we show that MKL 1 participates also to {{the control of the}} <b>cellular</b> <b>switch</b> between growth and quiescence. Experimental disconnection between MKL 1 and G-actin (globular actin), by using an MKL 1 mutant or enhancing the F (filamentous) -/G-actin ratio, generates a widely open chromatin state and a global increase in biosynthetic activity, classically associated with cell growth. Conversely, G-actin accumulation favours nuclear condensation and cell quiescence. These large-scale chromatin changes rely upon extensive histone modifications, exemplified by that of H 3 K 9 (H 3 Lys 9) shifting from trimethylation, a heterochromatin mark, to acetylation, a mark of euchromatin.

The creB gene encodes a functional deubiquitinating enzyme and the creC gene encodes a protein that contains five WD 40 repeat motifs, and a proline-rich region. These findings have allowed the in vivo molecular analysis of a <b>cellular</b> <b>switch</b> involving deubiquitination. We demonstrate that overexpression of the CreB deubiquitinating enzyme can partially compensate {{for a lack of}} the CreC WD 40 -repeat protein in the cell, but not vice versa and, thus, the CreB deubiquitinating enzyme acts downstream of the CreC WD 40 -repeat protein. We demonstrate using co-immunoprecipitation experiments that the CreB deubiquitinating enzyme and the CreC WD 40 -repeat protein interact in vivo in both carbon catabolite repressing and carbon catabolite derepressing conditions. Further, we show that the CreC WD 40 -repeat protein is required to prevent the proteolysis of the CreB deubiquitinating enzyme in the absence of carbon catabolite repression.

This dissertation presents a concept for the discovery and development of small molecule fragments binding to defined protein sites: Dynamic Ligation Screening enables the rapid and site-directed identification of low-affinity binders in protein activity and fluorescence polarization experiment by exploiting template-assisted fragment assembly. Dynamic Ligation Screening (DLS) was conducted with libraries of 100 - 7000 fragments consuming only minor amounts of enzyme: A fluorogenic protease substrate competed with an equilibrium of nucleophilic fragments and a designed peptide electrophile for the active-site. Decreased initial rates of product formation in the fluorophore-based enzyme assay indicated the inhibitory activity of the reversibly formed ligation product. One selected hit was modified synthetically in order to verify the binding site. Via an iterative scanning of different binding sites on the protein surface, moderately active peptidic inhibitors could be transformed into entirely non-peptidic inhibitors with a low µM KI. The concept was established {{for the development of}} a non-peptidic SARS coronavirus main protease (SARS-CoV Mpro) inhibitor.

40|$|Expression of IL- 2 by {{activated}} T {{helper cells}} {{is a key}} event of the adaptive immune response after antigenic stimulation. The dysregulation of IL- 2 is of fundamental consequence for the homeostasis {{of the immune system}} in vivo. While the molecular analysis of IL- 2 trans-criptional regulation has been extensively studied the cellular decision processes leading to IL- 2 expression are not known. In this study is shown that in human periphal CD 4 + Th cells the transcriptional response of IL- 2 can be modulated after initial mitogenic stimulation and is followed by a binary and not a graded decision process. The titration of the Ca 2 + ionophore ionomycin or inhibition of mitogenic stimulation by the classical calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A only changed the frequency of IL- 2 producing cells but not the intensity of IL- 2 production per cell. The molecular decision process leading to the binary IL- 2 expression pattern shown here was examined {{for the first time and}} on individual cells. On this account, the IL- 2 capture assay was used to separate IL- 2 producing and non-producing cells after stimulation. For single cell analysis, a method for cytometrical detection of the activated transcription factors NFATc 2 and NF-kB (p 65) in isolated nuclei was developed. The results proved NFATc 2 as a <b>cellular</b> <b>switch</b> of Ca 2 +/calcineurin dependent T cell activa-tion. The IL- 2 production showed great dependancy on the intracellular level of expressed NFATc 2 and results in binary IL- 2 expression pattern after all-or-non activation of NFATc 2 in individual cells. Graded stimulations by titration with Ionomycin or CsA lead to an all-or-non NFATc 2 but graded NF-kB (p 65) nuclear translocation per cell. Mathematical modeling predicts that co-operativity of at least 7 of the 13 NFATc 2 dephosphorylation sites after graded stimulation by ionomycin would be sufficient to induce a binary IL- 2 expression. By translating the strength of antigenic T cell stimulation into the frequency of cytokine producing Th cells, the described NFATc 2 switch is a general hub for productive adaptive immune response...|$|E

The fact that the step size of the influx reaction is a-priori unknown, and in general, may fluctuate in time with a given correlation time and statistics, introduces an additional non-demographic step-size noise into the system.

We analyzed their abilities to invade agar and to form pseudomycelium or hyphae under inducing conditions and their sensitivity to temperature and to Calcofluor white. Chitin staining was used to detect defects in their cell walls. Our results indicate that a functional Ras-cyclic AMP pathway {{is required for the}} formation of hyphae in Y. lipolytica and that perturbations in the processing of extracellular, possibly parietal, proteins result in morphogenetic defects...|$|R
