5|$|Judge Appleby {{eventually}} cut off {{funds for}} any further expert defense testimony. Shakur, in her autobiography, and Williams, in Inadmissible Evidence, both <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was difficult to}} find expert witnesses for the trial, because of the expense and because most forensic and ballistic specialists declined {{on the grounds of}} a conflict of interest when approached because they routinely performed such work for law enforcement officials.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Hadl {{learned that}} Tiger Electronics had {{licensed}} King Kong for a handheld game. He decided that Universal's earnings from it were too low {{and that the}} license's granting of exclusive rights to Tiger would impede the agreement with Coleco. On May 4, Sheinberg sent Tiger a mailgram demanding that they send their game in for further approval. Universal reviewed it and decided that King Kong was too similar to Donkey Kong. On May 8, Steinberg revoked Tiger's license, but Tiger president O. R. Rissman refused to give in and challenged Universal's <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> owned the King Kong name.|$|E
5|$|Peter Donovan criticises the language-games {{approach}} {{for failing to}} recognise that religions operate in a world containing other ideas and that many religious people make claims to truth. He notes that many religious believers not only believe their religion to be meaningful and true in its own context, but <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is true against all other possible beliefs; if the language games analogy is accepted, such a comparison between beliefs is impossible. Donovan proposes that debates between different religions, and the apologetics of some, demonstrates that they {{interact with each other}} and the wider world and so cannot be treated as isolated language games.|$|E

5|$|Several Muslim {{countries}} {{along the}} south coast of the Mediterranean Sea used a red flag similar to {{the flag of the}} Ottoman Empire. After the destruction of the Tunisian naval division at the Battle of Navarino on 20 October 1827, the sovereign Husainid Dynasty leader Al-Husayn II ibn Mahmud decided to create a flag to use for the fleet of Tunisia, to distinguish it from other fleets. There are some discrepancies over the date of the flag's adoption, as the government states that it was adopted in 1831, while other sources like Siobhan Ryan's Ultimate Pocket Flags of the World <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was adopted in 1835.|$|E
5|$|Sightings of {{the rail}} from 1950 to 2003 were from a {{restricted}} area of West Halmahera Regency, {{at the base of}} the western peninsula of the island, but it was recorded prior to 1950 as far as the southern point of Halmahera. More recent records showed that it is still present in a significantly larger area, including the northeast of the island, and locals <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> also occurs in the swamps near Kao, in the northwest.|$|E
5|$|The {{authority}} of the Byzantine emperor as the legitimate Roman emperor was challenged by the coronation of Charlemagne as Imperator Augustus by Pope Leo III in the year 800.

5|$|The film's {{cast and}} credits were {{unbilled}} {{and very few}} details emerged, but the film has been claimed to have featured Lon Chaney by two scholars. Jon Mirsalis states that Lon Chaney has an unbilled part as a pawnbroker. Michael Blake also notes that Lon Chaney {{had a role in}} the film, but Blake also states that the film had only one reel and lists the production code as 0119. Blake's <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a single reel is the subject of dispute because the release was originally as a two reel production in publications and many advertisements for the film.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{the blue}} whale is renowned {{for being the}} largest animal ever to have lived. In part because of its legendary status, many misconceptions still exist. For example, its size is often exaggerated. Many popular sources give the maximum length as 110 feet (33.5 meters) or more. While such lengths were {{reported}} in the whaling records, they were not scientifically verified and were probably exaggerated. Virtually all books and articles that mention the blue whale <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> can reach 100 feet (30.5 meters). This is probably true (the largest verified specimen was 29.9 meters, 98 feet) but is highly misleading as the average size is much smaller.|$|E
5|$|A Free Ride, {{also known}} as A Grass Sandwich, is a stag film of the silent era that is {{considered}} to be the earliest extant American hardcore pornographic movie. It depicts a motorist who picks up two women from the roadside and later engages in several sex acts with them. Although most scholars consider A Free Ride a 1915 film, some sources <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was produced later. The film's director used a pseudonym and the cast remained anonymous. The filming location is not known, although it may have been produced in New Jersey. Two contradictory theories have emerged regarding the identities of the cast: some sources suggest they were people with low social status, but others assert the opposite. The Kinsey Institute has a print of the film in its collection. A Free Ride was screened at the inauguration of the Museum of Sex. In 2004, Lisa Oppenheim, a New York-based artist, remade the film.|$|E

5|$|Guido Forti {{alleged that}} Shannon Racing had not paid him any money within the stipulated six-day {{deadline}} after {{the deal was}} concluded and refuted the <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> now owned 51% of his team. As the team ran out of money, it was doubtful whether it would turn up at the British GP. In the end, Forti took part, only for the cars to complete a mere handful of laps each in practice and thus failing to set a time quick enough to qualify. This was because it was becoming increasingly in debt to Cosworth and {{was running out of}} engine mileage for its cars, only having enough to make a token effort at participation. The team made it to the next race - the German GP - but both cars remained unassembled in the pit garages throughout the weekend after the engine supply was finally cut off.|$|E
5|$|In early 1935, {{however, the}} company {{heard about the}} game's {{excellent}} sales during the Christmas season of 1934 in Philadelphia and at F.A.O. Schwarz in New York City. Robert Barton, President of Parker Brothers, contacted Darrow and scheduled a new meeting in New York City. On March 18, Parker Brothers bought Darrow's game, helped him take out a patent on it, and purchased his remaining inventory. By April, 1935, the company had learned that Darrow was not the sole inventor of the game, but sought out an affidavit by Darrow to repeat his statements to the contrary, and thus bolster their claim to the game. Parker Brothers subsequently decided to buy out Magie's 1924 patent and the copyrights of other commercial variants of the game to <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had legitimate undisputed rights to the game.|$|E
5|$|In {{sentencing}} Lawrence, {{the judges}} {{found no evidence}} to support her claim that her life was threatened and although the prosecutors requested a lighter 20-year sentence due to her early cooperation with police, the judges sentenced her to life imprisonment. On the next day, the remaining three defendants, Chen, Nguyen and Norman, were sentenced to life imprisonment as well. On 24 January 2006, the prosecutors demanded the death penalty for Sukumaran, this being {{the first time that a}} demand of death was put forward for any of the Bali Nine. They told the Bali court that there was no reason to show any leniency to the 24-year-old, because he helped organize the heroin smuggling operation. The prosecutors also <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was Sukumaran who strapped heroin to the bodies of his fellow accused. Indonesian police identified Sukumaran as one of the main players, in what they said to be a major smuggling ring. On 26 January, it was also recommended that Andrew Chan receive the death penalty.|$|E

5|$|The airship had tumultuous {{times at}} the start. Professor A. W. Bernard of Nashville, Tennessee took claim to his {{invention}} in 1897. Myers sent telegrams to editors of newspapers {{in the month of}} May of that year explaining that he was the inventor of the world's first 'sky-cycle' airship in spite of what Bernard and others said. Myers explained to the newspapers that his invention had already been displayed in front of a group of people in New York City in August 1895. Myers showed to them that the basic principles of the controllable airship were already patented by him and his wife on May 26, 1885. He further explained that the only 'sky-cycle' patent ever issued to anybody was granted to him on April 20, 1897. Bernard was trying to stake <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was his invention and had really just made a duplicate of Myers' previous recorded patents.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} {{also suffered}} from financial problems, and Asif exceeded the budget {{on a number}} of occasions. The final budget of the film is a subject of debate. Some sources state that Mughal-e-Azam cost 10.5 million to produce (about US$2 million at the time), while others <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> cost 15million, about $3 million. This made Mughal-e-Azam the most expensive Indian film of the period. A number of estimates put the film's inflation-adjusted budget at 500 million to 2billion. The budget situation strained the relationship between Asif and Pallonji, while the production also faced troubled relationships among other crew members; differences crept up between Asif and Kumar when the former married the latter's sister. Another source of trouble was the romantic relationship and ultimate break-up of Kumar and Madhubala, who had been dating for nine years.|$|E
5|$|Believed to {{have been}} {{introduced}} by Al-Husayn II ibn Mahmud, although some sources, such as Abdel-Wahab, <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was in use three centuries earlier, the flag was rectangular in shape and divided into nine stripes, the middle one green and double the size of all other bands, while the others alternated between yellow and red. Featured {{in the center of}} the green stripe was the Zulfiqar, the legendary Islamic sword of Ali, with the blade in white and the hilt multicolored. The red and yellow stripes each contained five equidistant symbols, whose order was alternated between each stripe. These symbols were divided into two categories: one red six-sided star voided with a disk of a different color in the centerâ€”either a red star and green disk or a white star and blue diskâ€”, and a large disk voided in its lower right by a small disk of different color, with the combination being either a small red disk within a larger blue disk or a small yellow disk within a larger red disk. The first yellow stripe contains three red stars and two blue disks. The second stripe, red in color, contains three green disksand two white stars. The third stripe (second yellow one) is identical to the first, with the exception that the star in its center is white, while the fourth stripe (second white one) is identical to the second stripe.|$|E

5|$|During the turmoil, Harald {{was arrested}} and imprisoned, but the sources {{disagree}} on the grounds. The sagas state that Harald was arrested for defrauding the emperor of his treasure, {{as well as for}} requesting marriage with an apparently fictional niece or granddaughter of Zoe, called Maria (his suit supposedly being turned down by the empress because she wanted to marry Harald herself). William of Malmesbury states that Harald was arrested for defiling a noble woman, while according to Saxo Grammaticus he was imprisoned for murder. DeVries suggests that the new emperor may have feared Harald because of his loyalty to the previous emperor. The sources also disagree on how Harald got out of prison, but he may have been helped by someone outside to escape {{in the midst of the}} revolt that had begun against the new emperor. While some of the Varangians helped guard the emperor, Harald became the leader of the Varangians who supported the revolt. The emperor was in the end dragged out of his sanctuary, blinded and exiled to a monastery, and the sagas <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was Harald himself who blinded Michael V (or at least claimed to have done so).|$|E
5|$|Sirrus and Achenar beg the Stranger not {{to touch}} the green book that is stored in the same {{location}} as their final pages. They <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a book like their own that will trap the Stranger. In truth, it leads to D'ni, where Atrus is imprisoned. When the book is opened, Atrus asks the Stranger to bring him a final page that is hidden on Myst Island; without it, he cannot bring his sons to justice. The game has several endings, depending on the player's actions. Giving either Sirrus or Achenar the final page of their book causes the Stranger to switch places with the son, leaving the player trapped inside the Prison book. Linking to D'ni without the page Atrus asks for leaves the Stranger and Atrus trapped on D'ni. Linking to D'ni with the page allows Atrus to complete his Myst book {{and return to the}} island. Upon returning to the library, the player finds the red and blue books gone, and burn marks on the shelves where they used to be.|$|E
5|$|The single known tooth, a third upper molar (M3) {{known as}} T Li 41, is tiny, with {{a length of}} 1.29mm and width of 1.82mm. Mein and Ginsburg <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is the {{smallest}} known prosimian molar. The tooth is triangular in shape and shows a simple, reduced morphology. Three important cuspsâ€”the protocone, paracone, and metaconeâ€”are present, connected by a crest. They are low and rounded. The metacone, located {{at the back of}} the tooth, is closer to the protocone, which is on the front lingual corner (the side of the tongue), than it is to the paracone on the front labial corner (the side of the cheeks). The protocone is rounded on the lingual side and is attached to a weak crest on the front and back. On the front labial corner, a lengthy crest, the parastylar crest, is present, which includes a minor cusp known as a parastyle. Some wear is visible on the parastylar crest, and at the front of the tooth a contact facet with the preceding second upper molar is present. The tooth has a single, well-developed root, which contains a number of grooves, suggesting that it consists of three smaller, fused rootlets.|$|E
