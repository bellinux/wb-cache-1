5000|$|In 2003, Windows Desktop Search (WDS) {{replaced}} Microsoft Indexing Service. Instead of only matching {{terms to}} the details of the file format and file names, WDS brings in content indexing to all Microsoft files and text-based formats such as e-mail and text files. This means, that WDS looked into the files and indexed the content. Thus, when a user searched a term, WDS no longer matched just information such as file format types and file names, but terms, and values stored within those files. WDS also brought [...] "Instant searching" [...] meaning the user could type a character and the query would instantly start searching and updating the query as the user typed in more <b>characters.</b> <b>Windows</b> Search apparently used up a lot of processing power, as Windows Desktop Search would only run if it was directly queried or while the PC was idle. Even only running while directly queried or while the computer was idled, indexing the entire hard drive still took hours. The index would be around 10% of the size of all the files that it indexed. For example, if the indexed files amounted to around 100GB of space, the index would, itself, be 10GB large.|$|R
