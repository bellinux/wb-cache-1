We dene the union, complement, intersection and <b>containement</b> of bipolar interval neutrosophic sets. Also we dened BINWA operator and BINWG and estiblished a MADM method for BINSs...|$|E
40|$|Food {{packaging}} {{has multiple}} scopes i. e. : protection, communication, <b>containement</b> etc. but more recently other performances were requires such as to reduce preservatives and increase food safety. Actually active packaging can be intended as an innovative packaging {{that allows the}} extention of the shelf life of the products ameliorating or preserving their original qualities. Organic polymers are often the material of choice for these applications. Nevertheless, their properties not always meet the requirement of the industries. More recently, the incorporation of certain components in the packaging films can favour the release or the adsorption of the desired substances from or into the packaged food so prolong the shelf life and sustain the quality, the safety and sensory characteristics of the food...|$|E
40|$|We define {{syntactically}} a sub-class {{of decision}} lists (tree-like decision lists) and we show its equivalence {{with the class}} of bounded rank decision trees. As a by-product, the main theorem provides an alternate and easier proof of the Blum's <b>containement</b> Theorem [1]. Furthermore we give an inversion procedure for Blum's derivation of a decision list from a bounded rank decision tree. 1 Introduction Decision lists have been introduced by Rivest in [3] as a representation of boolean functions. He showed that k-decision lists, i. e. decision lists in which any term has at most k literals, are (1) a generalization of k-CNF, k-DNF and of depth-k decision trees and (2) are polynomially learnable under PAC model. [2] showed that constant rank decision trees are also polynomially PAC learnable and [1] showed that rank-k decision trees are a sub-class of k-decision lists, thus providing to an improvement of the result of [2] since constant rank decision trees can be polynomially PAC-lear [...] ...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{key factors}} dictating the safety and {{durability}} of the proposed U. S. Space Station {{is the ability to}} repair structural damage while remaining in orbit. Consequently, studies are conducted to identify the engineering problems associated with accomplishing structural repairs on orbit, due to zero gravity environment and exposure to extreme temperature variations. There are predominant forms of structural failure, depending on the metallic or composite material involved. Aluminum is the primary metallic material used in space vehicle applications. Welding processes on aluminum alloy structures were tested, resulting in final selection of electron beam welding as the primary technique for metallic material repair in Space. Several composite structure repair processes were bench-tested to define their applicability to on-orbit EVA requirements: induction heating prevailed. One of the unique problems identified as inherent in the on-orbit repair process is that of debris containment. The Maintenance Work Station concept provides means to prevent module contamination from repair debris and ensure the creation of a facility for crew members to work easily in a microgravity environment. Different technologies were also examined for application to EVA repair activities, and the concept selected was a spring-loaded, collapsible, box-like Debris <b>Containement</b> and Collection Device with incorporated fold-down tool boards and handholes in the front panel...|$|E
