40|$|Primary {{resource}} industries considering {{adaptation action}} {{in response to}} current or future climate changes {{need to consider the}} adaptive capacity of their constituent members if an industry-wide response is to occur. In particular, they need to know {{the extent to which the}} capacity to adapt exists and whether it can be enhanced. We focus on the role of <b>climate</b> change <b>awareness</b> in influencing adaptive capacity within an Australian primary industry that is already experiencing the impacts of climate change. <b>Climate</b> change <b>awareness</b> is the extent to which primary producers relate to and prioritise climate change as a driver of change. We assess <b>climate</b> change <b>awareness</b> using four fairly representative statements. Adaptive capacity is the human potential to convert existing resources into successful adaptation strategies. We assess adaptive capacity on the basis of current knowledge as comprising four essential dimensions: (1) the management of risk and uncertainty, (2) skills in planning, learning and reorganising, (3) financial and emotional flexibility, and (4) interest in adapting. A telephone survey was completed by 69 peanut producers in Queensland representing 88 % of the industry and a response rate of 90 %. We empirically show that primary producers that have higher <b>climate</b> change <b>awareness</b> also have a higher capacity to adapt on at least three dimensions of adaptive capacity. Our results suggest that it may be worth investing in supporting <b>climate</b> change <b>awareness</b> within primary industries if broad-scale climate adaptation planning is to be successful...|$|R

Evidence is searched for in the temperate zone of Brazil, which represents a particular challenge to architects. This paper presents five representative houses designed between 1930 and 1965 by the first generation of architects with an academic background in Curitiba. It is true that the Modern Movement is negatively seen in terms of passive architecture. Nevertheless, at its beginning, <b>climate</b> <b>awareness</b> was present, and it can be demonstrated in rather correct choices regarding envelope design and thermal zoning. Besides, there was an exemplary attitude of rationality in the solution of problems in a particular, regional context. Therefore, the Modern Movement in Brazil can be described not specifically as aware of climate, but (to some extent) aware of architecture itself as a cultural achievement. Thus, the improvement of the general performance of buildings could profit from a deeper understanding of history: it should investigate what was the spirit of the Modern Movement, and what (international, post-modern or simply global) influences were responsible for the almost ubiquitous and often regrettable reality of architecture as a commodity...|$|R

While the African continent is among the regions with the highest vulnerability to climate change, research on <b>climate</b> knowledge and <b>awareness</b> is lacking. Kenya is already grappling with the impacts of climate change, which are projected to increase in a non-linear and non-predictable manner. This study sought to determine <b>climate</b> change <b>awareness</b> levels among households residing in Upper Nyakach Division, Kisumu County, Kenya using common climate change markers viz heavy rainfall, floods, droughts and temperature. A cross-sectional survey design was adopted in which 384 household heads were selected as respondents from 11 sub-locations; all located within Upper Nyakach Division. A questionnaire was used to collect data. Most (90.9  %) respondents had observed changes in the overall <b>climate.</b> <b>Awareness</b> level of <b>climate</b> change varied significantly across the 11 sub-locations. To further gain insight unto which variables were the most significant determinant of <b>climate</b> change <b>awareness</b> in upper Nyakach division, Kisumu county, a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with Poisson error distribution was built. The model indicated that sex of the household head, education level and age significantly influenced respondents’ <b>awareness</b> to <b>climate</b> change markers. Most (87  %) households reported rising temperatures over the past 20  years. Over half (55.2  %) the respondents had observed declining rains, with significant differences being observed across age groups. Up to 75  % of the respondents reported increased droughts frequency over the last 20  years, with significant differences observed across gender. Most (86.7  %) respondents reported having observed changes in water sources with significant differences reported across age groups. The respondents reported an increased prevalence of malaria with significant differences being observed among the education levels and households’ main livelihoods. The general population of the Upper Nyakach Divison is aware of changing global climate. However, more effort is required in mitigating climate change as per the local settings.

40|$|<b>Climate</b> <b>awareness</b> {{programmes}} aim {{to inform}} the public of simple steps that can be made to reduce the environmental impacts of personal travel. However they fail to acknowledge that travel decisions are made at the individual level and that tailored strategies would be more effective at targeting distinct behavioural patterns. Statistics show that unsustainable travel behaviour and global greenhouse gas emissions are growing, and due to the perceived indispensable nature of personal travel, shifts to more sustainable modes remain a challenge. This paper aims to determine how local road authorities could update existing <b>climate</b> change <b>awareness</b> programmes to significantly reduce unsustainable travel. Results from postal questionnaires and focus groups in Hampshire identified travel behaviour characteristics and attitudinal traits which determined the extent to which voluntary travel behaviour changes are possible. Three groups were identified: Sustainably Aspiring Motorised Travellers (43. 9 %) were environmentally-focused, felt morally responsible and obligated to change their travel behaviour yet they travel principally by car. Sustainably Aspiring Active Travellers (29. 8 %) were characterised by sustainable attitudes and marked active travelling (i. e. by non-motorised modes). Conversely Environmentally Apathetic Motorised Travellers (26. 3 %) expressed little concern about their own personal behaviour and saw no point in changing it; this was highlighted by their heavy motorised travelling patterns. These results highlight the existence of three different types of individuals based on a combination of attitudinal and behavioural traits; an important consideration not currently identified in the implementation of <b>climate</b> change <b>awareness</b> programmes. These groups are related to different perceptions of the barriers to behaviour change which are dependent implicitly on perceived personal and social gains and losses. In order to overcome these perceived behavioural barriers and encourage the use of sustainable travel modes within cities therefore, <b>climate</b> change <b>awareness</b> programmes promoting travel behaviour change will likely only be successful when they can be targeted and tailored to specific groupings and crucially conveyed within the direct context that individual travellers experience. <b>Climate</b> change <b>awareness</b> programmes can then be an extremely useful tool to increase sustainable travel behaviour across cities and this paper demonstrates how local road authorities play an important role as part of such programmes. <br/...|$|R

Adaptation is particularly relevant in the context of developing nations, as climate change impacts pose a substantial threat to their continued sustainable development. Adaptive capacity is affected by many socio-economic, political, and gender-based factors, and may be enhanced by <b>climate</b> change <b>awareness.</b> Ascertaining levels of climate change knowledge in different sectors of society is therefore an important aspect of dealing with future climate change, in order to understand how best to improve <b>climate</b> change <b>awareness</b> and adaptive capacity. Elevating such awareness in society as a whole can be facilitated by focusing on the education system, and particularly by enhancing school students’ knowledge and understanding of climate change. It is essential to determine students’ conceptions (and misconceptions) of climate change, while also focusing on curricula content and on secondary school teachers’ knowledge of climate change, in order to plan and design effective instruction that builds on these concepts. The <b>Climate</b> Change <b>Awareness</b> and Education Programme (CCAEP) aims to ascertain secondary school student teachers, teachers and students’ prior knowledge of the causes and consequences of climate change, and to determine the existing status of climate-change related material on the secondary school curriculum in Tanzania with an initial focus on <b>climate</b> change <b>awareness</b> among secondary school teachers.
