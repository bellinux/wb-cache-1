5|$|In his seventies, Large, {{along with}} Pete Scholey, {{returned}} to the Borneo jungle {{as part of a}} 2003 Channel 4 documentary {{about the history of the}} SAS, taking the <b>camera</b> <b>crew</b> to the exact spot on the bank of the Sungei Koemba River where his patrol had successfully ambushed an Indonesian Army river boat in 1965.|$|E
5|$|A further {{survey of}} the graves was {{undertaken}} in 1986. A <b>camera</b> <b>crew</b> filmed the procedure, shown in Novas television documentary, Buried in Ice in 1988. Under difficult field conditions, Derek Notman, a radiologist and medical doctor from the University of Minnesota, and radiology technician Larry Anderson took many X-rays of the crewmen prior to autopsy. Barbara Schweger, an Arctic clothing specialist, and Roger Amy, a pathologist, assisted in the investigation.|$|E

5000|$|The Force is {{filmed in}} {{metropolitan}} and regional Western Australia. Small <b>camera</b> <b>crews</b> follow the police around during their daily duties. Field producer Tim Noonan {{said the only}} rule in filming was that the <b>camera</b> <b>crews</b> [...] "can't hinder police in any way". As a result, some footage is filmed from police cars or a safe distance away from the police, with wireless microphones used to record audio.|$|R
25|$|There was mayhem {{outside the}} court {{premises}} with large crowds gathering around restively and <b>camera</b> <b>crews</b> waiting {{to capture the}} trouble.|$|R
5|$|Director of {{photography}} Mark Irwin was fired during filming of Screams finale, {{a week before}} principal photography was to be completed. Upon review of the dailies, Craven found the footage was out of focus and unusable. Irwin was initially ordered to fire his <b>camera</b> <b>crew.</b> He retorted that if his crew were to be fired, they {{would also have to}} fire him. The producers fired him and replaced him with Peter Deming, who finished the film.|$|E
5|$|It is {{revealed}} that after their kiss, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) confirmed to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) her {{intention to marry}} Roy Anderson (David Denman). However, {{a few days before}} the wedding, Pam got cold feet and decided to call it off. She moved into her own apartment and began taking art classes. Pam's rejection sent Roy into a downward spiral, hitting rock bottom with a drunk driving arrest. When being interviewed by the <b>camera</b> <b>crew,</b> Roy makes a vow to win Pam back.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} television critics; many praised Krasinski and Fischer for the dramatic fight at the end. Furthermore, the reveal of the <b>camera</b> <b>crew</b> was commented upon by many critics. The episode was viewed by 4.19 million viewers {{and received a}} 2.0/5 percent rating among adults {{between the ages of}} 18 and 49, ranking third in its timeslot. The episode ultimately ranked as the highest-rated NBC series of the night.|$|E

50|$|The {{programme}} {{is produced}} and broadcast from ITV Yorkshire's Leeds studios with district reporters and <b>camera</b> <b>crews</b> based at newsrooms in Hull, Lincoln and Sheffield.|$|R
500|$|Interiors {{were shot}} with three cameras in wide, {{lingering}} master shots in single takes. Welles states that Corman [...] "had two <b>camera</b> <b>crews</b> on the set—that's why the picture, from a cinematic standpoint, {{is really not}} very well done. The two <b>camera</b> <b>crews</b> were pointed in opposite directions so that we got both angles, and then other shots were 'picked up' to use in between, to make it flow. It was a pretty fixed set and it was done {{sort of like a}} sitcom is done today, so it wasn't very difficult." ...|$|R
5|$|Not {{only did}} Sorabji, {{who had not}} written any music since 1968, return to {{composition}} {{as a result of}} Hinton's interest in his work, but on 24 March 1976 he gave the pianist Yonty Solomon permission to play his works in public (although it has been claimed that Michael Habermann received tentative approval at an earlier date). Several recitals ensued and led to the making of a television documentary on Sorabji, which was broadcast in 1977. The images in it consisted mostly of still photographs of his house; there was just one brief shot of Sorabji waving to the departing <b>camera</b> <b>crew.</b>|$|E
5|$|Production of {{the film}} began shortly after the {{television}} series finishing its original broadcasting on Japanese channels, although pre-production started during the show's run in March 2004. The film's production was led by director Seiji Mizushima, who also had directed the series as well. Mizushima allowed a <b>camera</b> <b>crew</b> and interviewers into the show's conference room at the Bones studios where he described how production went, as seen in a special feature on the DVD release {{of the film}}. The conference room was filled with every cut and drawing created for the show and movie, but it was eventually cleared out {{to make room for}} other projects.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} this episode came from Mike Reiss, {{who thought it}} would be funny if the plant went on strike. The writers of the episode, Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky, would later add the dental plan aspect of the plot. In several scenes, Mr. Burns is portrayed as the Devil who is tempting Homer and showing him what he could have. During the {{production}} of this episode, an ABC <b>camera</b> <b>crew</b> was allowed into the rewrite room, which Al Jean says he regrets because they were working on stage direction, and they came off as not being very funny.|$|E

5|$|The series {{begins by}} mostly {{introducing}} the office's workers via a tour given by branch manager Michael Scott {{for both the}} <b>camera</b> <b>crew</b> and a first-day temp (Ryan Howard). The audience learns salesman Jim Halpert has a crush on receptionist Pam Beesly (who helps him play pranks on co-worker Dwight Schrute), {{even though she is}} engaged to Roy (who works in the building's lower-level warehouse). News spreads throughout the office that Dunder Mifflin's corporate headquarters is planning to downsize an entire branch, leading to general anxiety, but Michael chooses to deny or downplay the realities of the situation in order to maintain employee morale.|$|E
5|$|A {{music video}} was issued in November 2003 {{to promote the}} single. The video shows Sebastian on a TV set as it is being {{prepared}} for a show. He is dressed casually in jeans and windcheater. He sits on boxes as he begins to sing with a <b>camera</b> <b>crew</b> starting to film him. An image {{of a young woman}} is shown as he continues. Various personnel walk around him and adjust the set. Sebastian stands and the image of the female is seen again, she wears white feathers. Later, Sebastian is dressed more formally in a white suit as he performs the song. On this set are plasma screens depicting the same young woman. The video ends with Sebastian in his casual gear again, sitting on the boxes. The video was produced by Australian Idols Stephen Tate and directed by the show's musical director, John Foreman. On 22 November, the clip was premiered on Network Ten's Video Hits – which had Tate as executive producer.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) {{asks for}} Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) help in {{adopting}} a baby, {{as the local}} adoption agency requires a reference letter from an employer. Andy promises to read her application letter, but tells the <b>camera</b> <b>crew</b> he will only sign it if she admits {{that she is a}} horrible person in it. However, Andy is unaware that Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) is using her own painful past as a non-adopted orphan to help Nellie with the process. When Andy coldly rejects Nellie's letter (which Erin helped her write), Nellie accepts his decision, but Andy is stunned to hear Erin crying sadly over the failure. He finally adds some mildly snarky but complimentary lines to her letter and signs onto it as a reference, leaving Nellie overjoyed.|$|E
50|$|Reporters and <b>camera</b> <b>crews</b> {{are based}} in newsrooms {{throughout}} the regions of the Sunshine Coast, Rockhampton, Cairns, Wide Bay, Toowoomba and Townsville. All bulletins are produced from WIN's studios in Maroochydore.|$|R
50|$|Australia Daze is a {{combination}} of footage shot by 29 different <b>camera</b> <b>crews</b> in various locations around Australia from midnight to midnight on 26 January 1988, the Bicentenary of European settlement in Australia.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, after asking {{were other}} members of the media wimps, he led a posse of journalists and <b>camera</b> <b>crews</b> into Gorse Hill, the {{up-market}} house at the centre of a legal battle.|$|R
5|$|Stone {{wanted to}} {{recreate}} the Kennedy assassination in Dealey Plaza. His producers had to pay the Dallas City Council {{a substantial amount of}} money to hire police to reroute traffic and close streets for three weeks. He only had ten days to shoot all of the footage he needed and so he used seven cameras (two 35mm and five 16mm) and 14 film stocks. Getting permission to shoot in the Texas School Book Depository was more difficult. They had to pay $50,000 to put someone in the window from which Oswald was supposed to have shot Kennedy. They were allowed to film in that location only between certain hours with only five people on the floor at one time: the <b>camera</b> <b>crew,</b> an actor and Stone. Co-producer Clayton Townsend has said that the hardest part was getting the permission to restore the building to the way it looked back in 1963. It took five months of negotiation.|$|E
5|$|The filmmakers {{knew from}} the {{beginning}} of production that the whales were their biggest effects concern; Dow recalled that they were prepared to change to another animal in case creating the whales proved too difficult. When Humphrey the Whale wandered into the San Francisco Bay, Dow and his <b>camera</b> <b>crew</b> attempted to gather usable footage of the humpback but failed to do so. Other footage of real humpbacks either did not exist on 35mm film or would have been difficult to match to specific actions required by the script. Compositing miniatures shot against bluescreen on top of water backgrounds would not have provided realistic play of light. Creating full-size mechanical whales on tracks would severely limit the types of angles and shots. To solve the whale problem, Rodis hired robotics expert Walt Conti. While Conti was not experienced in film, Rodis believed his background in engineering and design made him well-equipped for Rodis' planned solution: the creation of independent and self-contained miniature whale models.|$|E
5|$|After Poehler {{agreed to}} play the lead, they decided the show would revolve around an optimistic bureaucrat in small-town government. The idea was partly {{inspired}} by the portrayal of local politics on the HBO drama series The Wire, {{as well as the}} renewed interest in and optimism about politics stemming from the 2008 United States presidential election. The staff was also drawn to the idea of building a show around a female relationship, namely Leslie Knope and Ann Perkins. Reports that Daniels and Schur were developing a show together led to press speculation that it would, in fact, be a spin-off of The Office. The producers insisted their new series would be entirely independent. Nevertheless, their concept for it shared several elements with The Office, particularly the mockumentary approach, which allows the actors to look at and directly address the camera. The new show would also include documentary-style interviews, in which the characters speak one-on-one with the <b>camera</b> <b>crew</b> about the day's events. Again as with The Office, the new series would be scripted but improvisation would be encouraged among the actors.|$|E
5000|$|The film had a 24-day {{shooting}} schedule {{using two}} <b>camera</b> <b>crews</b> (one for principal photography, one for extensive 2nd-unit FX) at Santa Clarita Studios in Los Angeles, with Melrose Place filming next door.|$|R
50|$|American Harmony {{was filmed}} by James and his <b>camera</b> <b>crews</b> during the Society’s 2005, 2006 and 2007 International {{conventions}} and is interspersed with footage and other graphic elements {{provided by the}} Barbershop Harmony Society.|$|R

5|$|Everyone in {{the office}} {{complains}} about Dwight Schrute's (Rainn Wilson) building standards, such as un-plying toilet paper, adding motion sensors to the lights, and placing a roach billboard over the windows to the office. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), as office administrator, threatens to move everyone to a different building if nothing is done. She leaves and comes back with pictures of a newer office space and says they can move in three months. Dwight investigates and finds that the office building does not exist. When Dwight plays coy around Pam, she admits to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that she lied about the office building and that she is afraid of failing again after failing {{as an artist and}} a salesperson. Jim tries in vain to reassure her, and she breaks down in tears. Later Nate (Mark Proksch), Dwight's building assistant, discreetly gives Pam a book on the state building regulations. Pam shows Dwight that his policies are in violation of the laws written in the book, so Dwight puts everything back to normal. The <b>camera</b> <b>crew</b> confronts Dwight with footage showing that he overheard Pam's conversation with Jim and instructed Nate to give her the book on the building regulations. Dwight admits that he allowed her to win, but mocks the idea that he did so out of compassion.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) {{is forced}} to choose between Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) and a new man, Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy). Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) set up Kelly and Ravi, CeCe's pediatrician, in hopes of Kelly finally moving on from Ryan. Ryan makes several {{attempts}} to get back with Kelly, though everyone finds the attempts pathetic because he can not even say he truly loves her and wants to be with her always (he keeps qualifying all of his feelings for her) and even admits he would prefer she not be with anyone else if she {{is not going to be}} with him. Pam eventually says that he is not a nice person, and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) says he is not boyfriend material. Ryan tells the office he has a love poem for her, which Kelly has no interest in reading. As the staff are heading outside the building to go home, they see Ryan sitting on a steed professing his love (again, in insultingly hedging terms) to Kelly. She responds by saying she is in love with Ravi and hopes to stay friends with Ryan. They hug goodbye, which turns into a make-out session. The episode closes with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam finding and reading Ryan's love poem. Initially scoffing, they are both noticeably moved by it. Tearing up, Jim informs the <b>camera</b> <b>crew</b> that Ryan can never know of the incident.|$|E
25|$|News {{production}} and bureaus {{are located in}} Toronto (Richmond Hill) and Vancouver (Richmond). Reporters (and <b>camera</b> <b>crew)</b> may travel to remote locations if needed and mostly within Canada. There have been several occasions where reporters have travelled overseas, mainly to Hong Kong.|$|E

50|$|There {{were many}} hurdles. Initially Purvis dealt {{with how to}} hide TV <b>cameras,</b> <b>crews,</b> control trucks and the {{necessary}} workmen and equipment {{and how to get}} electricity and telephone lines two miles (3 km) to the woods.|$|R
50|$|ITV Border also {{maintains}} a bureau for Scottish Parliament coverage in Edinburgh with district news reporters and <b>camera</b> <b>crews</b> based locally in Dumfries, Galloway, Kendal, Selkirk and Whitehaven.
