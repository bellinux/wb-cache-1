5000|$|In 1947, {{the mine}} was nationalised {{as part of}} the governments post-World War II {{regeneration}} scheme, and became owned by the National Coal Board. Investment was made, and in the late 1940s a Meco-Moore <b>Cutter</b> <b>Loader</b> was installed, one of the first power loaders to be used in British mines, and as a result the Minister of Fuel and Power Hugh Gaitskell made a visit in December 1949. The colliery formed a rugby union club in 1952 called Penallta RFC, and in 1954 produced 500,000 tonnes of coal. During 1960 the shafts were extended to reach 800 yards as part of a scheme, which also included electrification of the shaft winding engines.|$|E
5000|$|The Meco-Moore <b>cutter</b> <b>loader</b> was {{an early}} twentieth-century British mining machine. It was invented by Mr M. Moore, and {{developed}} by the Mining Engineering Company (MECO) of Worcester. It was a heavy machine (120 hp / 89.5 kW) and was first used in a coal mine in Lancashire, England 1934. [...] The design was such that it worked along the coal seam (along a [...] "longwall panel") The machine's cutter bars, the [...] "jibs" [...] as they were called, (two in the original model and three in a later versions) were designed to both shear and undercut the coal seam. The cut coal was cut onto the connected conveyor belt system which took it towards the mine's entrance. It was, or was among, the first such machines to do both cutting and loading at the same time. The machine increased both productivity and safety.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} usable properties of surface layers improvement of cast carbon steel 200 – 450, by put directly in foundingprocess a composite surface layer {{on the basis of}} Fe-Cr-C alloy. Technology of composite surface layer guarantee mainly increase inhardness and aberasive wear resistance of cast steel castings on machine elements. This technology can be competition for generallyapplied welding technology (surfacing by welding and thermal spraying). In range of studies was made cast steel test castings withcomposite surface layer, which usability for industrial applications was estimated by criterion of hardness and aberasive wear resistance of type metal-mineral and quality of joint cast steel – (Fe-Cr-C). Based on conducted studies a thesis, that composite surface layer arise from liquid state, was formulated. Moreover, possible is control of composite layer thickness and its hardness by suitable selection of parameters i. e. thickness of insert, pouring temperature and solidification modulus of casting. Possibility of technology application of composite surface layer in manufacture of cast steel slide bush for combined <b>cutter</b> <b>loader</b> is presented...|$|E
40|$|Using {{processing}} of rotary cutting tools of <b>cutter</b> <b>loaders</b> and heading machines {{as an example}} it is shown that magnetic-abrasive machining ensures improvement of microgeometry and physicomechanical characteristics of both 30 CrMnSi steel casing and WC 8 hard alloy insert during carrying out one operation. The tests conducted confirmed the potential of using this method for machining of multicomponent parts that consist of materials with various physicomechanical and magnetic propertie...|$|R
5000|$|The mining museum {{contains}} Australia's {{most comprehensive}} collection of coalmining artefacts, including coal <b>cutters,</b> coal <b>loaders,</b> continuous miners and underground transports. A recently developed multimedia exhibit titled [...] "Fire in the Mine" [...] explores the working lives of coalminers {{in the mid}} Twentieth Century and the horrific consequences of an underground fire {{that occurred in the}} State Coal Mine in 1953. The museum's latest exhibits [...] "Hewers of Coal" [...] and [...] "Lithgow Valley Colliery Fire & Explosion 1886" [...] use photographs, artefacts and digital media to investigate various aspects of coal mining in the New South Wales Western Coalfield.|$|R

The efficiency of various extraction systems is compared. Time taken for each phase of the operations is tabulated. Labour requirements and output are recorded. Costs of operating the Midway <b>cutter</b> and Bell <b>loader</b> are estimated. The need for further integrated man-machine studies is discussed...|$|R
50|$|In 1952 a drift was sunk to the Wavehill seam in a hill to {{the west}} of the {{existing}} shafts. This drift was known as Waratah Colliery No.2 drift and was a mechanised mine using Mavour & Coulson coal <b>cutters,</b> Joy 14BU <b>loaders</b> & Joy battery operated shuttle cars. The shuttle cars loaded the coal onto a conveyor belt which transported the coal to a new set of screens & loading point close to the original screens. No.2 drift was closed on 19 May 1961 after working out all economic coal reserves.|$|R
