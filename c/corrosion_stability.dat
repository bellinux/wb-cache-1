40|$|The {{electrochemical}} deposition by pulse current of Zn-Co alloy coatings on steel was examined, {{with the aim}} {{to find out whether}} pulse plating could produce alloys that could offer a better corrosion protection. The influence of on-time and the average current density on the cathodic current efficiency, coating morphology, surface roughness and <b>corrosion</b> <b>stability</b> in 3 % NaCl was examined. At the same Ton/Toff ratio the current efficiency was insignificantly smaller for deposition at higher average current density. It was shown that, depending on the on-time, pulse plating could produce more homogenous alloy coatings with finer morphology, as compared to deposits obtained by direct current. The surface roughness was the greatest for Zn-Co alloy coatings deposited with direct current, as compared with alloy coatings deposited with pulse current, for both examined average current densities. It was also shown that Zn-Co alloy coatings deposited by pulse current could increase the <b>corrosion</b> <b>stability</b> of Zn-Co alloy coatings on steel. Namely, alloy coatings deposited with pulse current showed higher <b>corrosion</b> <b>stability,</b> as compared with alloy coatings deposited with direct current, for almost all examined cathodic times, Ton.

40|$|Despite the {{advantages}} of ceramics, with their high <b>corrosion</b> <b>stability</b> in vivo, most medical implant constructions are still made from metals [1]. To increase the <b>corrosion</b> <b>stability</b> of metals, different coatings are applied to the implant surfaces, typically such coatings are the oxides of the metals in the implants [2]. For an oxide film to have protective properties it must satisfy the following requirements: • to be unbroken and pore-free; • to have good adhesion with the metal; • to have a thermal expansion constant near to the value for the metal; • to be chemically inert in different environments; • to be hard and have minimal wear under load. The oxides of metals such as Al, Ti, Zr, Nb and Ta satisfy all these properties to some degree [3 – 5]. Indeed, some of these metal oxides are used in medicine independently without a metal substrate, such as implant constructions from sapphire (a single-crystal modification of Al 2 O 3) [6, 7]. Titanium is {{the most widely used}} material for medical implant manufacture [8].
