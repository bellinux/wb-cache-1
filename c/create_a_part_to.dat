40|$|AbstractSustainability is a {{consideration}} of resource utilization without depletion or adverse environmental impact. In manufacturing, important sustainability issues include energy consumption, waste generation, water usage and {{the environmental impact of}} the manufactured part in service. This paper deals with three aspects of sustainability as it applies to additive manufacturing. First is a review of the research needs for energy and sustainability as applied to additive manufacturing based on the 2009 Roadmap for Additive Manufacturing Workshop. The second <b>part</b> is <b>an</b> energy assessment for selective laser sintering (SLS) of polymers. Using polyamide powder in a 3 D Systems Vanguard HiQ Sinterstation, energy loss during a build was measured due to the chamber heaters, the roller mechanism, the piston elevators and the laser. This accounted for 95 % of the total energy consumption. An overall energy assessment was accomplished using eco-indicators. The last topic is electrochemical deposition of porous SLS non-polymeric preforms. The goal is to reduce energy consumption in SLS of non-polymeric materials. The approach was to mix a transient binder with the material, <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>an</b> SLS green <b>part,</b> <b>to</b> convert the binder, and then to remove the open, connected porosity and <b>to</b> densify the <b>part</b> by chemical deposition at room temperature within the pore network. The model system was silicon carbide powder mixed with a phenolic transient binder coupled with electrolytic deposition of nickel. Deposition was facilitated by inserting a conductive graphite cathode in the <b>part</b> center <b>to</b> draw the positive nickel ions through the interconnected porous network and to deposit them on the pore walls. The Roadmap for Additive Manufacturing Workshop was sponsored by the National Science Foundation under Grant CMMI- 0906212 and by the Office of Naval Research under Grant N 00014 - 09 - 1 - 0558. The electrolytic deposition research was sponsored by the National Science Foundation, Grant CMMI- 0926316...|$|R

25|$|A robotic CNC router is a {{computer}} controlled robotic arm in which the router or spindle is <b>part</b> of <b>a</b> head mounted {{to the end of}} the robot arm. The main difference between a CNC router and a robotic router is the ability to router using a 4,5 or 6-axis coordinate system because of the rotation allowed by the joints in the robot arm as well as the rotation of the head that the router spindle is mounted to. CAD/CAM software programming can be used <b>to</b> indicate the <b>part</b> location, which is usually fixed to an immobile table and clamped in place. The robotic router trimming process then follows a programmed path for router cutting <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> from <b>a</b> blank or more commonly- to trim the flashing from <b>a</b> molded <b>part</b> <b>to</b> complete the finishing process that in the past, was a manual process.|$|R
