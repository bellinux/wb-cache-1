The cork construction provided little protection against attack and hand-thrown missiles. In order to provide more protection, {{the construction of the}} helmets changed. Visually they remained the same, however instead of being constructed of cork they were now made out of a very hard wearing plastic material and covered in felt. Internally, they were padded with foam which was factory fitted into the shell of the helmet with a webbing-style harness to allow it to sit on the head in the correct manner. Also, two chin straps were added at this time, one for normal duties which was a thin leather strap and a [...] "public order strap" [...] which was made of thick material and included a <b>chin-cup</b> to securely hold the helmet on the head. As well as these changes, helmet plates were altered so that the fixings on them were no longer lugs, but were prong-type pins which were inserted into the helmet and spread apart, so that if the helmet plate was hit by a missile, the lugs would not cause injury to the wearer.|$|E
40|$|AIM To {{systematically}} {{search the}} literature and assess the available evidence for the influence of <b>chin-cup</b> therapy on the temporomandibular joint regarding morphological adaptations and appearance of temporomandibular disorders (TMD). MATERIALS AND METHODS Electronic database searches of published and unpublished literature were performed. The following electronic databases with no language and publication date restrictions were searched: MEDLINE (via Ovid and PubMed), EMBASE (via Ovid), the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, and CENTRAL. Unpublished literature was searched on ClinicalTrials. gov, the National Research Register, and Pro-Quest Dissertation Abstracts and Thesis database. The reference lists of all eligible studies were checked for additional studies. Two review authors performed data extraction independently and in duplicate using data collection forms. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or the involvement of an arbiter. RESULTS From the 209 articles identified, 55 papers were considered eligible {{for inclusion in the}} review. Following the full text reading stage, 12 studies qualified for the final review analysis. No randomized clinical trial was identified. Eight of the included studies were of prospective and four of retrospective design. All studies were assessed for their quality and graded eventually from low to medium level of evidence. Based on the reported evidence, <b>chin-cup</b> therapy affects the condylar growth pattern, even though two studies reported no significance changes in disc position and arthrosis configuration. Concerning the incidence of TMD, it can be concluded from the available evidence that <b>chin-cup</b> therapy constitutes no risk factor for TMD. CONCLUSION Based on the available evidence, <b>chin-cup</b> therapy for Class III orthodontic anomaly seems to induce craniofacial adaptations. Nevertheless, there are insufficient or low-quality data in the orthodontic literature to allow the formulation of clear statements regarding the influence of <b>chin-cup</b> treatment on the temporomandibular joint...|$|E
40|$|THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO FIND AND EVALUATE THE CHANGES OF THE DENTAL AND SKELETAL ELEMENTS OF THE CRANIOFACIAL COMPLEX, WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON THETEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT IN PATIENTS TREATED WITH THE ACTIVATOR AND THE <b>CHIN-CUP</b> APPLIANCES. FOR THIS: A GROUP OF 20 PATIENTS AGED FROM 8 - 13 YEARS WITH SKELETAL CLASS II DIV 1 MALOCCLUSION, AND A SANE GROUP OF PATIENTS WITH SKELETAL CLASS III MALOCCLUSION WERE STUDIED BEFORE AND AFTER 1 - 1 1 / 2 YEARS OF TREATMENT WITH ACTIVATOR AND CHIN- CUP APPLIANCES, RESPECTIVELY, USING LATERAL CEPHALOMETRIC X-RAYS AND TOMOGRAPHIES OF THE T. M. J. A GROUP OF 20 PATIENT 7 - 13 YEARS WITH HORMONIC SKELETAL PROFIL AND NORMAL OCCLUSION WAS USED AS CONTROL GROUP. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY LEAD TO THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS: IN THE PATIENTS TREATED WITH THE ACTIVATOR, A FORWARD AND DOWNWARD MOVEMENT OF THE MANDIBLE WAS OBSERVED, WHILE THE OPPOSITE MOVEMENT WAS OBSERVED IN THE PATIENTS TREATED WITH THE <b>CHIN-CUP.</b> THE CONDYLE DOES NOT REGAIN ITS ORIGINAL POSITION IN THE GLENOID FOSSA AFTER THE TREATMENT IN THE ACTIVATOR PATIENTS. THE CRANIAL BASE ANGLE IN THE PATIENTS TREATED WITH ACTIVATOR DIMINISHED, WHILE IN THE PATIENTS TREATED WITH <b>CHIN-CUP</b> REMAINED ANALTERED OR INCREASED SLIGHTLY. ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a case of}} a 12 -year-old girl with maxillary deficiency, mandibular prognathism, and facial asymmetry, undergoing growth hormone (GH) therapy due to idiopathic short stature. Children of short stature with or without GH deficiency have a deviating craniofacial morphology with overall smaller dimensions; facial retrognathism, especially mandibular retrognathism; and increased facial convexity. However, a complete opposite craniofacial pattern was presented in our case of a skeletal Class III girl with idiopathic short stature. The orthodontic treatment goal was to inhibit or change the direction of mandibular growth and stimulate the maxillary growth of the girl during a course of GH therapy. Maxillary protraction and mandibular retraction were achieved using occipitomental anchorage (OMA) orthopedic appliance in the first stage of treatment. In the second stage, the patient was treated with a fixed orthodontic appliance using a modified multiple-loop edgewise archwire technique of asymmetric mechanics and an active retainer of vertical <b>chin-cup.</b> The treatment led to an acceptable facial profile and obvious facial asymmetry improvement. Class I dental occlusion and coincident dental midline were also achieved. A 3 Â½-year follow-up of the girl at age 18 showed a stable result of the orthodontic and dentofacial orthopedic treatment. Our case shows that the OMA orthopedic appliance of maxillary protraction combined with mandibular retraction is effective for correcting skeletal Class III malocclusion with midface deficiency and mandibular prognathism in growing children with idiopathic short stature undergoing GH therapy...|$|E
