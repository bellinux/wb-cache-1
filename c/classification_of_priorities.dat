40|$|In {{the present}} article the notion of "priorities of the prosecution" are defined, its value for the sphere {{of human rights and}} freedoms of man and citizen are stated. The <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>priorities,</b> which is based on the {{provisions}} of the Russian Constitution and international law are stated. According to the authors, under the primary protection are the personal rights, which are derived from a natural person's status, inherent from birth. Next in order of priority are political rights, ensuring the full participation of citizens in the political life of the country, and finally - human rights in the socio-economic and cultural spheres, to guarantee the freedom of personal development and decent standards of living. Due to the authors` opinion, prosecutors in the allocation of the most important goals and objectives of its activities are guided by objective factors such as the analysis of the state of law, connection of the situation in this sphere of legal relations with the maintenance of stability and balance in the society, human rights functions, country's leadership and guidance of the General Prosecutor of the Russian Federation. The article shows, that the choice of priorities in the public prosecutor's activity, including the field of human rights and freedoms of man and citizen is a complex multi-faceted process, which affects the international situation, the internal processes, occurring in the country, including natural and man-made emergencies {{and a number of other}} factors. Authors identify issues that, in their opinion, should be addressed to improve the effectiveness of prosecutorial activities. That is the further development of the law about the Prosecutor's Office and the consolidation of its legal position, including constitutional status. Conclusions and suggestions are based on the authors' theoretical positions, made by the Russian jurists, as well as according their own empirical researches...|$|E

The main {{goal of the}} thesis is an introduction of selected theory of software testing and analogical use of the theory in data warehousing environment. Part of the main goal is an introduction of architectonic model of testing process and later on focusing on part of testing which is problematic in data warehousing area. Partial goal of the thesis is validation of problematic part of the model using practical scenario. This partial goal {{is divided into two}} parts. First part focuses on requirements gathering and categorizing their priority. Second part focuses on demonstrating how project requirements, available resources and Teradata specific environment manipulate with the testing process. Theoretical part summarizes selected theory of software testing which is later applied in the area of data warehouse testing. The chapter introduces phases of data warehouse testing and specific goals of each testing phase. Chapter also describes model FURPS which is used to classify software quality dimensions a selected methods <b>of</b> requirements <b>priority</b> <b>classification.</b> An architectural model of testing process and its entities are described {{in the second part of}} theory. The theory then focuses on problematic part of the model which is requirements gathering and <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> their <b>priority</b> and demonstrates the influence of time, quality requirements and available resources on the overall process of testing. Practical part introduces a real-life scenario which demonstrates an application of described theory, namely requirements gathering, <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> requirements <b>priorities</b> and assigning dimensions of quality. The next part demonstrates the influence of available resources and requirements on the scope of testing. The outcome of the practical part of the thesis is that requirements gathering and <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> their <b>priorities</b> allows us to classify and sort scope of testing into logical and clear units, assign roles and their responsibilities and flexibly react on changes of project requirements. The thesis also points out that there are risks associated with changes of scope and emphasizes on the need of their evaluation...|$|R

40|$|A plantwide energy {{assessment}} was performed at Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Co., an integrated sugarcane farming and processing facility {{on the island}} of Maui in the State of Hawaii. There were four main tasks performed for the plantwide energy assessment: 1) pump energy assessment in both field and factory operations, 2) steam generation assessment in the power production operations, 3) steam distribution assessment in the sugar manufacturing operation, and 4) electric power distribution assessment of the company system grid. The energy savings identified in each of these tasks were summarized in terms of fuel savings, electricity savings, or opportunity revenue that potentially exists mostly from increased electric power sales to the local electric utility. The results of this investigation revealed eight energy saving projects that can be implemented at HC&S. These eight projects were determined to have potential for $ 1. 5 million in annual fuel savings or 22, 337 MWh equivalent annual electricity savings. Most of the savings were derived from pump efficiency improvements and steam efficiency improvements both in generation and distribution. If all the energy saving projects were implemented and the energy savings were realized as less fuel consumed, there would be corresponding reductions in regulated air pollutants and carbon dioxide emissions from supplemental coal fuel. As HC&S is already a significant user of renewable biomass fuel for its operations, the projected reductions in air pollutants and emissions will not be as great compared to using only coal fuel for example. A <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> implementation <b>priority</b> into operations was performed for the identified energy saving projects based on payback period and ease of implementation...|$|R
40|$|Corporate social {{responsibility}} is increasingly being analysed through the stakeholder approach. However, great contradictions appear {{as soon as}} the number of stakeholders increases. The firm is then confronted with the dilemma of managing these stakeholders. Recent models have proposed a <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> stakeholder demands according to power, legitimacy and urgency. Indeed, these three criteria enable us to define demand groups and create lists <b>of</b> <b>priorities</b> in the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> demands, but the problem is far from being resolved. The present article aims at analysing the problem of managing responsibility through stakeholders. It pays special attention to the classification which could result from an ethical mode of action based upon the ethics of care. As such, we shall argue that such a mode of action considerably inverses the usual order <b>of</b> <b>classification...</b>|$|R

40|$|Most of {{distributed}} {{mutual exclusion}} algorithms {{do not use}} the notion <b>of</b> <b>priority.</b> To solve the distributed prioritized mutual exclusion problem, F.

Many distributed algorithms for mutual exclusion have been proposed. In token ring algorithm [1], the token circulates along the ring. A site, which wants to enter the critical section, stops the token when it arrives and blocks it during the use of critical section. In Lamport's algorithm [10], each process has a queue. A process, which wants to enter critical section, broadcasts a request message with a time-stamp. The return of time-stamped acknowledgements allows it to check w [...] ...|$|R
