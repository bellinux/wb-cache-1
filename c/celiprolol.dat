40|$|Backgroundβ-adrenoceptor {{antagonist}} <b>celiprolol</b> {{has been}} widely used as an effective antihypertensive agent. Some studies reported that <b>celiprolol</b> enhances nitric oxide production. The {{purpose of the present}} study is to examine the effects of <b>celiprolol</b> on vein graft intimal hyperplasia and endothelium-dependent nitric oxide (NO) -mediated relaxation. MethodsJapanese white rabbits were randomized to a control group that was fed regular rabbit chow or to a <b>celiprolol</b> group that was fed regular rabbit chow supplemented with 100 mg/body <b>celiprolol</b> sodium. The reversed jugular vein was implanted into the carotid artery. At 2 and 4 weeks after the operation, vein grafts in both groups were harvested, and intimal hyperplasia of the vein grafts was assessed. At 4 weeks after the operation, harvested vein grafts from both the groups were examined on the endothelium-dependent relaxation by application of Ach and were examined to detect for endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) expression and superoxide anion production. ResultsCeliprolol inhibited intimal hyperplasia of carotid interposition-reversed jugular vein grafts 4 weeks after implantation (Intima/media index of <b>celiprolol</b> group, 0. 48 ± 0. 01 vs control group, 1. 07 ± 0. 08, P <. 05) and suppressed cell proliferation in the neointima 2 weeks after implantation. In addition, <b>celiprolol</b> significantly enhanced endothelium-dependent NO-mediated relaxation in the vein graft with no change in eNOS expression and a reduction in superoxide production. ConclusionsThese novel findings clearly demonstrate that β-adrenoceptor antagonist <b>celiprolol</b> can suppress intimal hyperplasia of the vein graft, which may be due to the enhancement of nitric oxide function through an inhibition of superoxide production. These results strongly support the clinical usefulness of <b>celiprolol</b> administration for preventing intimal hyperplasia of the vein graft after bypass grafting. Clinical RelevanceLate graft failure caused by neointimal hyperplasia limits the efficacy of vein grafting. Various treatments were examined to reduce neointimal hyperplasia, but a standard clinical treatment has not yet been established. We report here the inhibitory effect of β-adrenoceptor antagonist <b>celiprolol</b> on the development of vein graft intimal hyperplasia. In addition, we demonstrate that <b>celiprolol</b> showed endothelium-dependent NO-mediated relaxation through an inhibition of superoxide production in vein graft. Because the clinical benefits and safety of <b>celiprolol</b> have been established to a certain extent through long-term clinical usage, <b>celiprolol</b> may soon become available treatment after vein bypass grafting...|$|E

Here, we attempted to demonstrate involvement of both influx and efflux transporters in vivo in gastrointestinal {{absorption of}} <b>celiprolol</b> in mice. Plasma concentration of <b>celiprolol</b> (3 mg/kg) after oral administration was mostly under the limit of quantification in wild mice, whereas that in mdr 1 a/b knockout (mdr 1 a/b(-/-)) mice was much more obvious, indicating P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux. Then, the oral absorption of <b>celiprolol</b> in mdr 1 a/b(-/-) mice was further examined to investigate influx transport mechanism with avoiding effect of P-glycoprotein. Coadministration of bromosulfophthalein (BSP), an inhibitor of various influx transporters including organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) reduced plasma <b>celiprolol</b> concentration. Inhibition by BSP of <b>celiprolol</b> uptake from apical membranes was confirmed in Ussing-type chamber of small intestinal tissues. Uptake of <b>celiprolol</b> by human small intestinal transporter OATP-A/ 1 A 2 was also confirmed in Xenopus Laevis oocytes. Interestingly, OATP-A/ 1 A 2 accepts various b-blockers including acebutolol, atenolol and sotalol, oral absorption of which is inhibited by coadministration of citrus juice or telithromycin in human.

40|$|Investigation of the {{underlying}} mechanism leading to inter- and intrasubject variations in the plasma concentration-time profiles of drugs (1) can considerably benefit rational drug therapy. The significant effect of gastric emptying on the rate and extent of <b>celiprolol</b> absorption and its role with respect to double-peak formation was demonstrated in the present study. In four dogs racemic <b>celiprolol</b> was dosed perorally in a crossover design during four different phases of the fasted-state gastric cycle and gastric motility was recorded simultaneously using a manometric measurement system. Intravenous doses were also given to obtain disposition and bioavailability parameters. The blood samples were assayed by a stereoselective HPLC method (2). The time to onset of the active phase of the gastric cycle showed an excellent correlation with the time to <b>celiprolol</b> peak concentration. Furthermore, bioavailability was increased when <b>celiprolol</b> was administered during the active phase. Double peaks were observed when the first active phase was relatively short, suggesting that {{a portion of the}} drug remained in the stomach until the next active phase. Population pharmacokinetic modeling of the data with a two-compartment open model with two lag times incorporating the motility data confirmed the effect of time to gastric empyting on the variability of the oral pharmacokinetics of <b>celiprolol.</b> The fasted-state motility phases determine the rate and extent of <b>celiprolol</b> absorption and influence the occurrence of double peaks. Peak plasma levels of <b>celiprolol</b> exhibit less variability if lag times, and therefore gastric emptying times, are taken into consideration...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{well-being}} of hypertensive patients may be {{adversely affected by}} the disease itself, its complications, and other concomitant processes such as anxiety, sedation, and side effects of the prescribed drugs. Some recently developed antihypertensive agents have been suggested to be devoid of these deleterious effects on well-being expressed as quality of life. Object: We compared the effect on {{quality of life of}} a standard cardioselective beta-blocker atenolol to the effect of <b>celiprolol</b> as a representative of a new class of selective beta-blockers with vasodilatory properties. One-hundred-thirty-two patients with mild to moderate hypertension were eligible to enter a 28 -week double-blind parallel-group study, consisting of a 4 -week run-in period on placebo and a 24 -week period on dosage-adjusted treatment with either atenolol or <b>celiprolol.</b> Results: Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were assessed, as was quality of life perception by a selected test battery including the Quality of Life Questionnaire of Bulpitt and Fletcher [1990]. During <b>celiprolol</b> treatment, supine blood pressure fell from 167 / 101 (range 120 - 200 / 95 - 116) to 150 / 92 mm Hg (p < 0. 0001). This antihypertensive effect was at least as good with <b>celiprolol</b> as with atenolol. Quality of life perception was comparable for the 2 drugs, although some adverse effects were more frequent during atenolol than during <b>celiprolol,</b> particularly after prolonged treatment. Also patient compliance was better for <b>celiprolol</b> than for atenolol. Conclusions: Our results show that the selective beta-blocker with vasodilatory property <b>celiprolol</b> is at least as effective as atenolol and that it has additional advantage in terms of enhancement of some quality of life variables...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Previous {{studies have}} shown that beta 1 {{selective}} agents have fewer adverse effects on exercise metabolism than nonselective beta blockers, and this has been attributed to their reduced blockade of beta 2 receptors. This study aimed at determining whether a beta blocker with partial agonist activity at beta 1 and beta 2 receptors (<b>celiprolol)</b> was better than a conventional beta 1 receptor-blocker (atenolol) in prolonging exercise capabilities. METHODS: After four days of treatment with <b>celiprolol</b> 200 mg, atenolol 50 mg, or placebo, 22 healthy volunteers exercised on a treadmill for two hours at 50 % of their maximal oxygen uptake. Resting heart rate and blood pressure were recorded before and after exercise. During exercise, fat oxidation, plasma free fatty acids, glycerol, glucose, and ammonia were measured together with heart rate and perceived exertion. RESULTS: Mean exercising heart rate was significantly lower in those taking either of the beta blockers than in those taking placebo, and significantly lower for those taking atenolol rather than <b>celiprolol.</b> Fat oxidation was significantly lower for those taking <b>celiprolol</b> (38. 8 (SD 12. 2) %, P < 0. 01) and atenolol (36. 6 (15. 9) %, P < 0. 01) compared with placebo (45. 6 (14. 1) %). For the first 15 minutes of exercise, fat oxidation was significantly lower for those taking atenolol (24. 6 (12. 8) %, P < 0. 01) than <b>celiprolol</b> (29. 6 (14. 3) %). The rise in plasma free fatty acids and glycerol during exercise was also significantly attenuated by both beta blockers in comparison with the rise in those taking placebo (P < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Both <b>celiprolol</b> and atenolol reduced fat oxidation compared with placebo. For the first 15 minutes of exercise fat oxidation was preserved by <b>celiprolol,</b> but not atenolol. This preservation of fat oxidation during the early part of exercise may confer some small benefit to patients who take beta blockers and intend to exercise regularly.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundWe have {{reported}} that α and β adrenergic blockers could protect against emotional stress-induced cardiac dysfunction but those protective effects of β adrenergic blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), such as <b>celiprolol,</b> are unknown. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate whether ISA could relate with this protective effect. Methods and resultsRats medicated with <b>celiprolol</b> (8 mg/kg), metoprolol (4 mg/kg), or vehicle, were restrained for 30 min (immobilization stress: IMO) to reproduce emotional stress, and anesthetized to release stress. We measured the fractional area change (FAC) using an echocardiography (SONOS 5500) with s 12 probe (frequency: 5 – 12 MHz, frame rate: 120 Hz) at the end of IMO and every 10 min for 1 h. During IMO, FAC in rats with a premedication of metoprolol was lower than in those with a premedication of vehicle or <b>celiprolol.</b> At 20 min after IMO, FAC in rats with a premedication of <b>celiprolol</b> was significantly higher than that with a premedication of metoprolol or vehicle (84 ± 9 % vs. 65 ± 3 % or 60 ± 7 %, p< 0. 05). At 60 min after IMO, FAC in rats with a premedication of vehicle or <b>celiprolol</b> recovered, but FAC in rats with a premedication of metoprolol did not.

40|$|Background Vascular Ehlers-Danlos {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} severe disease that causes arterial dissections and ruptures {{that can lead to}} early death. No preventive treatment has yet been validated. Our aim was to assess the ability of <b>celiprolol,</b> a beta(1) -adrenoceptor antagonist with a beta(2) -adrenoceptor agonist action, to prevent arterial dissections and ruptures in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Methods Our study was a multicentre, randomised, open trial with blinded assessment of clinical events in eight centres in France and one in Belgium. Patients with clinical vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome were randomly assigned to 5 years of treatment with <b>celiprolol</b> or to no treatment. Randomisation was done from a centralised, previously established list of sealed envelopes with stratification by patients' age (32 years). 33 patients were positive for mutation of collagen 3 A 1 (COL 3 A 1). <b>Celiprolol</b> was uptitrated every 6 months by steps of 100 mg to a maximum of 400 mg twice daily. The primary endpoints were arterial events (rupture or dissection, fatal or not). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00190411. Findings 53 patients were randomly assigned to <b>celiprolol</b> (25 patients) or control groups (28). Mean duration of follow-up was 47 (SD 5) months, with the trial stopped early for treatment benefit. The primary endpoints were reached by five (20 %) in the <b>celiprolol</b> group and by 14 (50 %) controls (hazard ratio [HR] 0. 36; 95 % CI 0. 15 - 0. 88; p= 0. 040). Adverse events were severe fatigue in one patient after starting 100 mg <b>celiprolol</b> and mild fatigue in two patients related to dose uptitration. Interpretation We suggest that <b>celiprolol</b> might be the treatment of choice for physicians aiming to prevent major complications in patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

40|$|IntroductionVascular Ehlers-Danlos {{syndrome}} (vEDS) is an {{autosomal dominant}} inherited disorder of connective tissue. This syndrome results from mutations in the gene encoding type III procollagen. The patients can present with spontaneous arterial rupture or dissection. We had previously described that <b>celiprolol</b> stiffened large-sized elastic artery (common carotid artery) in vEDS. We tested {{the effects of}} <b>celiprolol,</b> a beta 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist with a beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist action in small-sized muscular artery (radial artery) in vEDS. Methods 47 vEDS patients with no previous beta-blocker were randomized to 5 years treatment. According to a PROBE design, they were allocated either to <b>celiprolol</b> (50 to 200 mg once a day, n= 23) or no treatment (n= 24). Radial internal diameter, intimamedia thickness (IMT) and distension were measured on the right arm with a 10 -MHz ultrasound system analyzing the radiofrequency signal. Radial blood pressures were obtained with applanation tonometry. Other radial parameters (wall cross-sectional area, wall-to-lumen ratio, distensibility, Young's elastic modulus and circumferential wall stress) were calculated from radial internal diameter, IMT, distension, mean blood pressure and pulse pressure. We used MIXED procedure of the SAS® System through the repeated statements to compare serial changes in blood pressure and arterial parameters in two groups. ResultsAfter 12 months, heart rate, radial systolic and mean blood pressure, pulse pressure, IMT, Young's elastic modulus and circumferential wall stress did not change in both groups. Radial diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly (p= 0. 03) and {{to the same extent}} in both groups (− 5 % in the <b>celiprolol</b> group and − 6 % in the control group) (period effect). Radial internal diameter, wall cross-sectional area increased significantly (+ 5 %, p= 0. 04 and + 12 %, p= 0. 04 respectively) and wall-to-lumen ratio decreased significantly (− 2 %, p= 0. 04) in <b>celiprolol</b> group but not in control group (periodby-group interaction). Significant increase in distensibility was observed in <b>celiprolol</b> group (+ 18 %, p= 0. 04) but not in control group (group effect).

40|$|Beta-adrenergic {{blocking}} {{agents are}} commonly used in combination with digitalis to control excessive heart rate during exercise in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. However, {{little is known about}} the effect of betaadrenergic blockade on exercise capacity in these patients. Accordingly, a randomized, double-blind, crossover placebo-controlled study was performed to assess the efficacy of <b>Celiprolol,</b> a new cardioselective betablocker with partial intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, on exercise performance in nine men with chronic atrial fibrillation. All but one patient was receiving maintenance digitalis during the study. Heart rate, blood pressure and gas exchange variables were measured at rest and during treadmill exercise testing while the patients were receiving maintenance <b>Celiprolol</b> or placebo. Significant reductions in heart rate and systolic blood pressure compared with control values were observed at submaximal exercise, at the gas exchange anaerobic threshold and at maximal exertion while the patients were taking <b>Celiprolol.</b> However, oxygen uptake at the gas exchange anaerobic threshold during <b>Celiprolol</b> therapy was 12. 3 versus 14. 0 ml oxygen/kg per min during placebo administration (a 12 % difference, p < 0. 01). Similarly, oxygen uptake at maximal exertion during <b>Celiprolol</b> therapy was 17. 6 versus 21. 0 ml/kg per min during placebo administration (a 16 % difference, p < 0. 01). Treadmill time was also reduced during the <b>Celiprolol</b> phase compared with placebo (11. 3 versus 10. 3 minutes; a 19 % difference, p < 0. 01).

40|$|A {{capillary}} zone electrophoresis {{method was}} developed for the enantioseparation of <b>celiprolol</b> enantiomers, using a sulfated beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) as a chiral selector. The use of a coated capillary was necessary to achieve stable and reproducible enantioseparations. A central composite design was applied to optimize the method and four parameters were selected for this study: the buffer pH, the buffer concentration, the sulfated beta-CD concentration and the temperature. Resolution between <b>celiprolol</b> enantiomers as well as analysis time and generated current were established as responses.

Six chiral aryloxy enantiomers (atenolol, sotalol, <b>celiprolol,</b> carvedilol, metoprolol and propafenone) were tested in bi-directional transport studies. The separation and quantitation of these enantiomers were performed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetra-O-acetyl-β-d-glucopyranosyl isothiocyanate (GITC) as a pre-column derivatizing agent. Bi-directional transport studies demonstrated that <b>celiprolol</b> and carvedilol exhibited significant enantioselectivity in polarized transport at the concentration range tested. The efflux ratio (ER) for (R) -(+) -celiprolol was 8. 96, but it was much lower for (S) -(-) -celiprolol which is 3. 42 at the concentration of 96. 0 μM; carvedilol had the same transport behavior as <b>celiprolol</b> while {{the difference between the}} ER values of two enantiomers was not as significant as <b>celiprolol</b> at the concentration of 5. 0 μM.

In both blood vessels, <b>celiprolol</b> (10 - 9 - 10 - 4 M) failed to produce relaxation in rings with and without endothelium; these same tissues relaxed in an endothelium-dependent manner to acetylcholine (10 - 6 M). All tissues relaxed completely {{in the presence of}} papaverine (10 - 4 M). In the coronary artery, isoproterenol (10 - 9 - 10 - 4 M) produced endothelium-independent relaxations which were inhibited in a competitive fashion by <b>celiprolol</b> (pA 2 = 7. 52 + 0. 14; slope = 0. 98, 95 % confidence limits = 0. 80 - 1. 15). In other experiments, strips of canine saphenous veins were incubated with [3 H]norepinephrine ([3 H]NE) and suspended for superfusion.

However, the changes after 12 weeks treatment were different (p less than 0. 05) between the groups, leading to lower levels of plasma esterified cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and apoprotein AI, AII, and B in the <b>celiprolol</b> group. Plasma lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase activity (LCAT) was not modified, suggesting that reverse cholesterol transport was not affected by the drugs. In both treatment groups, a significant positive relationship was observed between changes in LDL cholesterol and apoprotein B. As compared with nifedipine, <b>celiprolol</b> after 12 -week therapy had a rather favorable plasma lipid profile. The clinical relevance of such findings, in terms of prevention of cardiovascular complications, has yet to be established. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} celiprolol-induced vasodilatation in aorta {{taken from}} 12 -week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) {{and the effect}} of AT(1) angiotensin II receptor antagonism on the vasodilatory action of <b>celiprolol</b> in Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats and SHR. In WKY rats, the celiprolol-induced relaxation was greatly decreased in denuded aorta, and completely abolished in intact aorta by Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (⌊-NAME, 100 microM). In SHR, celiprolol-induced relaxation was reduced compared to WKY rats (Emax (value obtained for the highest concentration, 300 µM) = 39. 1 + or - 3. 78 %, n= 21 vs. 80. 4 + or - 3 % in WKY rats, n= 10; P< 0. 0001). Endothelium removal or pre-treatment with ⌊-NAME did not alter celiprolol-induced relaxation in SHR. In both strains, relaxation to <b>celiprolol</b> was decreased in the presence of nadolol (a β 1 /β 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist, 10 µM). N-[[3 -[(2 S) - 2 -hydroxy- 3 -[[2 -[4 -[(phenylsulfonyl) amino] phenyl]ethyl]amino] propoxy]phenyl]methyl]-acetamide (L 748337, a β 3 -adrenoceptor antagonist, 7 µM) had no effect. A 12 -day treatment with candesartan cilexetil (an AT(1) receptor antagonist, 0. 37 or 1 mg/kg/day) reduced systolic blood pressure in both strains, but only improved relaxation to <b>celiprolol</b> in SHR, and only at the highest dose (Emax= 64. 2 +/- 3. 9 %, n= 10, P< 0. 0001 vs. SHR control). In both strains, local aortic AT 1 receptor antagonism with candesartan CV 11974 (100 µM) had no effect. The endothelial β 1 /β 2 relaxation induced by <b>celiprolol</b> was therefore impaired in SHR aorta and AT 1 receptor antagonism improved the response to <b>celiprolol,</b> in conjunction with a reduction in blood pressure.

40|$|The {{symptomatic}} {{benefits of}} combining beta-adrenoceptor blockers and nitrates in angina pectoris are well recognised. Their actions on cardiac haemodynamics and volumes when combined have been poorly characterized. Accordingly {{this study investigated}} a new cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent <b>celiprolol</b> and buccal nitroglycerine in 24 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease. Following a control period, with confirmed stable haemodynamics, three groups (n = 8 /group) of prospectively matched patients, were studied following intravenous <b>celiprolol</b> (8 mg), buccal nitrate (10 mg) or their combination. Haemodynamics and left ventricular ejection fraction (nuclear probe) were determined following each intervention. The actions of each regimen on the haemodynamics of exercise-induced angina were compared by exercise testing in the control state and following each regimen. At rest, <b>celiprolol</b> did not alter haemodynamic parameters. Nitrate therapy reduced left ventricular filling pressure (pulmonary artery occluded pressure [...] PAOP) and volumes; the ejection fraction and heart rate increased. Combination therapy resulted in a highly significant reduction in left ventricular preload and afterload (PAOP and mean arterial blood pressure) at an increased left ventricular ejection fraction and reduced cardiac volumes; there was a trend to reduce cardiac double product (HR X SBP). During exercise <b>celiprolol</b> reduced systolic blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac index; systemic vascular resistance index increased. Nitrate therapy reduced blood pressure and PAOP, and increased ejection fraction. Combination therapy reduced all components of the triple product (heart rate, systolic blood pressure and PAOP) without affecting the other haemodynamic or radionuclide parameters. These data suggest improvements in cardiac function from the combination of <b>celiprolol</b> and nitrate therapy which were not achieved by either agent when used as monotherapy; they afford an interesting insight into {{the manner in which}} such widely utilised therapeutic modalities interact in coronary artery disease...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBeta (β) -blockers {{are widely}} used in the {{treatment}} of cardiovascular disease but are well recognised for causing bronchoconstriction in asthmatic subjects. The third-generation cardio-selective β-blocker <b>celiprolol</b> is a selective β 1 -adrenergic blocking agent with β 2 -agonist properties and would therefore be a preferred β-blocker if an asthmatic subject required treatment with β-blockers for cardiovascular disease.

In healthy volunteers the mean difference in GFR was 4. 8 ml min- 1 (95 % CI - 8. 2 to 17. 7 ml min- 1) and the mean difference in ERBF was 49. 8 ml min- 1 (95 % CI - 47. 5 to 147 ml min- 1) after <b>celiprolol.</b> In patients with chronic renal insufficiency the mean difference in GFR was - 2. 1 ml min- 1 (95 % CI - 64. 6 to 65. 8 ml min- 1).

40|$|Background: Third {{generation}} {{beta blockers}} have an intrinsic simpatico-mimetic activity and are cardioselective. Therefore, {{they should not}} have adverse bronchial effects and could even have a slight bronchodilator activity. Aim: To test the efficacy and safety of <b>celiprolol</b> in hypertensive patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. Patients and methods: Uncomplicated hypertensive patients with chronic obstructive lung disease received <b>celiprolol</b> during 12 weeks. They were subjected to monthly clinical assessment and ventilatory function was measured on the basal period {{and at the end of}} the trial. Results: During the study period, blood pressure fell significantly from 179 ± 6 / 112 ± 8 to 161 ± 4, 7 / 98 ± 1. 6 mmHg. No changes were observed in forced expiratory volume in 1 s or in forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75 % of the vital capacity.

40|$|<b>Celiprolol,</b> a novel beta blocker, {{may be more}} {{effective}} than propranolol in unstable angina pectoris because of both its beta- 1 -receptor selectivity and its vasodilator property In the present report 53 patients with angiographic coronary artery disease but uncom-promised left ventricular function and with electrocardiographically documented recurrent angina pectoris in spite of bed rest, aspirin, and repeated sublingual adminis-tration of nitroglycerin were studied. They were randomized for treatment with equipo-tent doses of either the nonselective beta blocker propranolol (80 mg/day) or the selective beta blocker with beta- 2 -agonistic property, <b>celiprolol</b> (200 mg/day) during one week. Angina frequency was higher in the propranolol group (P < 0. 01), whereas myocardial oxygen demand as estimated by the double product (DP = SBP x HR, systolic blood pressure x heart rate) was equally reduced by the two beta blockers. Forearm blood flow was essentially higher in the <b>celiprolol</b> group (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Introduction: beta-Blockers {{are known}} to worsen FEV 1 and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in {{patients}} with asthma. Both characteristics determine the outcome of COPD, a disease with frequent cardiac comorbidity requiring beta-blocker treatment. Design: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over study. Setting: An ambulatory, hospital outpatient clinic of pulmonary diseases. Patients: Patients with mild-to-moderate irreversible COPD and AHR. Intervention: Fifteen patients received propranolol (80 mg), metoprolol (100 mg), <b>celiprolol</b> (200 mg), or placebo for 4 days, followed by a washout period >= 3 days. On day 4 of treatment, FEV 1 and PC 20 were assessed. Immediately hereafter, formoterol (12 mu g) was administered and FEV 1 was measured for up to 30 min. Results: PC 20 was significantly lower (p < 0. 01) with propranolol and metoprolol treatment (geometric means, 2. 06 mg/mL and 2. 02 mg/mL, respectively) than with placebo (3. 16 mg/mL) or <b>celiprolol</b> (3. 41 mg/mL). FEV 1 deteriorated only after propranolol treatment (2. 08 +/- 0. 31 L) [mean +/- SD] compared with placebo (2. 24 +/- 0. 37 L). The fast bronchodilating effect of formoterol was hampered by propranolol (mean increase in FEV 1 at 3 min, 6. 7 +/- 8. 9 %) but was unaffected by the other beta-blockers (16. 9 +/- 9. 8 %, 22 +/- 11. 6 %, and 16. 9 +/- 9. 0 % for placebo, metoprolol, and <b>celiprolol,</b> respectively). Conclusions: Pulmonary effects did not occur by <b>celiprolol.</b> Only propranolol reduced FEV 1 and the bronchodilating effect of formoterol. Both metoprolol and propranolol increased AHR. Thus, different classes of beta-blockers have different pulmonary effects. The anticipated beneficial cardiovascular effects of a P-blocker must be weighted against the putative detrimental pulmonary effects, ie, effect on FEV 1 AHR, and response to additional beta(2) -agonists...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects on}} sleep of six beta-adrenergic {{blockers}} (propranolol, dilevalol, pindolol, metoprolol, <b>celiprolol</b> and atenolol) which {{differ in their}} pharmacological characteristics were studied in sponta-neously hypertensive rats. Electroencephalographic activity was recorded for 6 hr after p. o. administration of drugs or vehide, and the stages of wakefulness, rapid eye movements (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep (non-REM) were classified thereafter. In separate experiments antihypertensive activity of each drug was assessed by the tail-cuff technique. The most common effect of the beta-blockers examined was a decrease of the duration of REM.

40|$|In {{the present}} study a hydrodynamically {{balanced}} system of <b>celiprolol</b> hydrochloride was developed as single unit floating capsule.

40|$|ObjectivesCeliprolol, a {{beta-blocker}} {{of third}} generation, {{is known to}} induce beta 2 -adrenoceptors (-AR) -mediated vasodilation, but the role of other beta-AR subtypes has not been investigated. Thus, the first {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the participation of beta 3 -AR in the celiprolol-induced relaxation in Wistar Kyoto rat (WKY) thoracic aorta. Furthermore, the second objective was designed to determine whether the celiprolol-induced relaxation was altered in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) aorta, and to evaluate the effect of systemic or local angiotensin II (AngII) AT 1 receptor (AT 1 R) antagonism on the relaxant effect of <b>celiprolol.</b> MethodAortic rings were mounted in organ baths and preconstricted with phenylephrine. Cumulative concentration response curves to <b>celiprolol</b> (0. 1 to 300 μm) were established in different experimental conditions. ResultsCeliprolol produced a significant concentration dependent relaxation in WKY aorta (Emax= 66. 85 ± 5. 4 %, n= 10) which was decreased in the presence of nadolol (beta 1 /beta 2 -AR antagonist, 10 μm) or SR 59230 A (beta 3 -AR antagonist, 1 μm). Relaxation to <b>celiprolol</b> was greatly decreased in denuded aortic rings, and abolished in intact rings pre-treated with L-Name (NOsynthases inhibitor, 100 μm). In SHR aorta, celiprolol-induced relaxation was significantly reduced (Emax= 39. 4 ± 4. 1 %, n= 8) compared to WKY, whereas endothelium removal did not alter celiprolol-induced vasorelaxation. A 12 days treatment with candesartan cilexetil (AngII AT 1 R antagonist, 0. 37 or 1 mg/kg/day) reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) in both WKY and SHR, and significantly improved aorta relaxation to <b>celiprolol</b> more in SHR than in WKY (WKY : Emax= 71. 7 ± 5, 1 %, n= 12; SHR : Emax= 64. 2 ± 3. 9 %, n= 14). Furthermore, local aortic AT 1 R antagonism with candesartan CV 11974 (100 mM) improved celiprolol-induced relaxation, but only in WKY aorta (Emax= 78 ± 5. 6 %, n= 7). ConclusionsCeliprolol induced an endothelial beta 1 -, beta 2 -and beta 3 -AR relaxation in WKY aorta through NO pathway. In SHR aorta, we showed, for the first time, that the celiprolol-induced vasorelaxation was impaired and that only the systemic AT 1 R antagonism with candesartan cilexetil improved the celiprolol-induced relaxation. This indicated that the beneficial effect of candesartan cilexetil was likely related to decreased SBP but not to specific mechanisms that may occur in aortic smooth muscle and/or endothelial cells...|$|E
