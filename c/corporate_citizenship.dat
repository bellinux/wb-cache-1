We use Gubrium and Holstein‘s framework on interpretive practice to study the Corporate Sustainability Reports of multinational automotive companies regarding global warming. We observe three common themes – recognizing the issue of greenhouse gases, acknowledging stakeholders, and being role models for society. However, these themes take on unique meanings vis-à-vis each corporate identity. We utilize our analytic findings to offer theoretic propositions regarding emergent meanings of <b>corporate</b> environmental <b>citizenship.</b> These meanings are important to understand as firm behavior will be based on these socially-constructed meanings...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between spirituality in the corporate environment and <b>corporate</b> or organisational <b>citizenship</b> behaviour. The relationships amongst the sub-dimensions of workplace spirituality (meaningfulness of work, sense of community, alignment with organisational values) and the sub-dimensions of <b>corporate</b> or organisational <b>citizenship</b> behaviour (altruism, conscientiousness, sportsmanship, courtesy, civic virtue) are also examined. The {{extent to which the}} sub-dimensions of organisational citizenship behaviour predict workplace spirituality are analysed. The study was undertaken in a retail products outlet that focuses on quality and professionalism. The sample was drawn using cluster sampling and the adequacy of the sample was assessed using the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure and Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity. Data was collected using a closed-ended, established questionnaire and analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The results reflect that the organisation is fairly high on workplace spirituality with the focus being on meaningfulness of work and, on <b>corporate</b> or organisational <b>citizenship</b> behaviour with altruism and civic virtue being its greatest strength. There is a significant relationship between spirituality in the corporate environment and <b>corporate</b> or organisational <b>citizenship</b> behaviour, with sportsmanship and civic virtue being strong predictors of workplace spirituality. The results therefore, display the dynamic relationship between spirituality in the corporate environment and <b>corporate</b> or organisational <b>citizenship</b> behaviour, which when nurtured has the potential to enhance both bottom-lines of profits and people as well as society as a whol...|$|R

Results supported this expectation of dif-ference, with some modification.

The paper draws on the assumption that corporate social disclosure can be considered as the most direct expression of the companies' attitudes and behaviours regarding social responsibility. The principal finding of this study is: firms' disclosure is currently restricted to specific CSR themes.

40|$|Although {{known for}} quite a while both in {{organizational}} studies and management practice, the notion of "corporate citizenship" (CC) remains somewhat vague and unexplored. Drawing especially on a niche perspective in the Anglo Saxon debate, this article claims that time has come to go beyond the widespread propensity to employ the CC label merely to rebrand general and already existing ideas about "corporate social responsibility" (Csr). In particular, three possible alternative views of CC are presented: CC as holistic approach to Csr; as interdependence between firms and their distinctive local communities; and as <b>corporate</b> governance of <b>citizenship</b> entitlements (both traditional and emerging) with which individual actors are or strive to be endowed. As a whole, the picture outlined suggests that businesses are increasingly playing political roles in society and - even more significantly - that they are appearing to be directly involved in the transformation of the very domain of citizenship...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} I provide a {{critical}} perspective on governing the global corporation. While {{the papers in}} the 2009 special issue of Business Ethics Quarterly explore the political role of corporations I argue that they lack a sophisticated analysis of power across institutional and actor networks. The argument that corporate engagement with deliberative democracy can enhance the legitimacy of corporations {{does not take into}} account the effects of institutional, material and discursive forms of power that determine legitimacy criteria. As a result <b>corporate</b> versions of <b>citizenship</b> mediate versions of social responsibility and morality, which are reflected in the institutional and political economic norms that are produced by this power/knowledge. In order to overcome the limits of corporate social responsibility there is a need to develop more democratic forms of global governance of corporations. A radical revisioning of democratic governance would also need to overcome the limits posed by sovereignty and would require new forms of multi-actor and multi-level translocal governance arrangements in an attempt to create forms of power that are more compatible with the principles of economic democracy...|$|R
40|$|The UN Global Compact is a well-intentioned {{approach}} to convince corporate entities, particularly transnational corporations, to adopt principles {{that would lead}} to an improvement in {{the quality of life of}} people and maintain sustainable environment policies. Although there is some evidence of good <b>corporate</b> responsibility and <b>citizenship,</b> mainly in the developed countries, it is far from satisfactory in the developing countries. Pacific Forum Island Countries (FICs) are small, have fragile environments, large subsistence and rural populations and, additionally, have large numbers of households living in poverty. This paper suggests that the UN Global Compact will certainly help these countries to articulate their concerns in the global environmental governance debate and perhaps receive some tangible support to ensure that corporate entities pursue their business according to the principles laid down under the UN Global Compact. However, it will not be enough to ensure that FICs are actually protected from environmental degradation or to help them to reduce poverty. In their attempt to embrace global capitalism FICs would need complementary social and environmental policies to accompany the free-trade policies...|$|R
