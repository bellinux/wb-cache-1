500|$|Ricardo López Murphy, {{minister}} of economy of president Fernando de la Rúa, said that Alfonsín was [...] "the man {{who fought for}} our democracy and the strengthening of institutions, {{during a time of}} conflicts and polarizations that our society was merged into". Cristian Ritondo, legislator of the Republican Proposal, said that [...] "Alfonsín was the main actor of the return of democracy to Argentina. He was a sinonym of work, responsibility and patriotism". Gerardo Morales said that [...] "when we were young in 1983 and sang 'we are life, we are peace', {{it was more than a}} slogan, it was a synthesis of our hopes: do not suffer more persecutions, live in democracy, in freedom and peace. We were part of the <b>collective</b> <b>project</b> led by Alfonsín". Elisa Carrió pointed that she had political disputes with him, but respected him nonetheless. Julio César Strassera, judge of the trial of the juntas, hoped that Alfonsín would be remembered as a great democrat. Daniel Scioli, governor of the Buenos Aires province, praised that he died with a complete peace of mind. Mauricio Macri, mayor of Buenos Aires, considered that he must have died in peace, after fulfilling his goals.|$|E

2500|$|De Stijl was {{influenced}} by Cubist painting {{as well as by}} the mysticism and the ideas about [...] "ideal" [...] geometric forms (such as the [...] "perfect straight line") in the neoplatonic philosophy of mathematician M.H.J. Schoenmaekers. The De Stijl movement was also influenced by Neopositivism. [...] The works of De Stijl would influence the Bauhaus style and the international style of architecture as well as clothing and interior design. However, it did not follow the general guidelines of an [...] "-ism" [...] (e.g., Cubism, Futurism, Surrealism), nor did it adhere to the principles of art schools like the Bauhaus; it was a <b>collective</b> <b>project,</b> a joint enterprise.|$|E

2500|$|Shot in November 1970, Pioneers in Ingolstaldt [...] was {{commissioned}} for television. Fassbinder {{wanted to bring}} the plot from the 1920s to contemporary Germany, but the producers, fearing to offend the German army, refused. A compromise [...] did not satisfy any of the parts and midway onto the project Fassbinder lost interest on it. The film suffered as a consequence and it ranks among Fassbinder's weakest films. The tensions [...] and bitterness that had surrounded the making of Whity lead Fassbinder to dismantle the <b>collective</b> <b>project</b> of the anthiteather as a production company. Instead, he founded his own production company: Tango films. Pioneers in Ingolstadt, although broadcast before the theatrical release of Beware of a Holy Whore, was the last film made by Fassbinder during his formative period. In the following year, 1971, Fassbinder shot only one film: The Merchant of Four Seasons.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the diverse}} {{accounts}} in Tovarășe de drum, Burța-Cernat singles out those of Babeți, who recalls the importance tote bags had {{for her family}} during two decades of communism, and Bittel, who speaks about the ideal female cook, as [...] "the queen of sarmale". She is however critical {{of the fact that}} such a contribution was initiated by men, arguing that this impinges on its merits: [...] "given {{the way in which they}} write here, the ladies invited to partake in this <b>collective</b> <b>project</b> leave the impression that they are striving to fall in line with the rules of a game, [...] to confirm [...] the already consolidated idea about them: the idea of difference—much too essentialist (and it is biological essentialism that is involved here)—, the idea that [...] they see the world, politics included, different from humanity's masculine majority." [...] As part of this comment, she also argues that the book is excessively indebted to concrete economic aspects which women found especially challenging, whereas the [...] "generically human" [...] intellectual needs are [...] "placed in brackets". Chivu, who saw the work as fluctuating between the seriousness of Ruști's account and Babeți's humorous recollection, believed Simona Popescu's contribution, which describes communist experience as [...] "laughing out of pity", to be [...] "the most balanced". In reference to the entire text, and in particular accounts of the ban on abortion, he argues: [...] "all [...] female authors fundamentally speak about the same thing: the torment of being a woman, between the frustration of having one's intimacy forbidden and the efforts of illicit femininity." [...] Babeți's account was also viewed with interest by journalist Florentina Ciuverca, who also drew attention to Ruști's story about how, despite the official campaign against abortion, a doctor preemptively subjected her to curettage over a case of vaginal bleeding.|$|E
