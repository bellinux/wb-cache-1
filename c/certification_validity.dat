40|$|The {{problem of}} key {{exchange}} and strong authentication in the Directory services {{according to the}} X. 500 Recommendation is addressed with certificates which are issued by well-known, trusted authorities known as certification authorities. Finding a path of certification assignment for <b>certification</b> <b>validity</b> checking and verification of the communication party public key is a rather complex task in the global Directory. This paper describes {{the development of a}} tool which addresses this problem and provides support for the end user and the certification authority in finding a path of certification assignment...|$|E
40|$|A {{career in}} {{surgery in the}} United Kingdom demands a {{commitment}} to a long journey of assessment. The assessment methods used must ensure that the appropriate candidates are selected into a programme of study or a job and must guarantee public safety by regulating the progression of surgical trainees and the certification of trained surgeons. This review attempts to analyse {{the psychometric properties of}} various assessment methods used in the selection of candidates to medical school, job selection, progression in training, and <b>certification.</b> <b>Validity</b> is an indicator of how well an assessment measures what it is designed to measure. Reliability informs us whether a test is consistent in its outcome by measuring the reproducibility and discriminating ability of the test. In the long journey of assessment in surgical training, the same assessment formats are frequently being used for selection into a programme of study, job selection, progression, and certification. Although similar assessment methods are being used for different purposes in surgical training, the psychometric properties of these assessment methods have not been examined separately for each purpose. Because of the significance of these assessments for trainees and patients, their reliability and validity should be examined thoroughly in every context where the assessment method is being used...|$|E
40|$|The EURATOM treaty {{stipulates}} {{clearly in}} Article 8 and annex V {{the need for}} nuclear isotopic reference material and standards. The Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) is producing these material standards helping the European measurement laboratories {{in the field of}} nuclear material control and accountancy to perform measurements of fissile material to the required standards. One main activity of IRMM is the development of uranium and plutonium large-sized dried (LSD) spikes for nuclear safeguards. The IRMM- 1027 series of LSD spikes is produced in large batches of approximately 1200 units and contains about 50 mg total uranium with an enrichment of ~ 20 % 235 U and about 1. 8 mg of ~ 98 % 239 Pu per ampoule. These amounts of U and Pu are chosen as such to enable direct measurement of the 238 U and 240 Pu content in spent fuel solutions. The LSD spikes are covered with a cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) polymer as a protective stabilizer during storage and transport. The presence of Pu and other ambient factors are causing degradation of this organic layer {{over a period of several}} years, limiting the <b>certification</b> <b>validity</b> in time. Optimisation of the current procedure was done at IRMM towards improved organic coating guaranteeing the integrity of the layer for a time span of 24 months. Nevertheless for longer shelf lives research and development for alternative coating approaches are required. A particular concern is the guaranteed supply of pure 239 Pu metal over the next decade and beyond. IRMM proposes therefore a different approach to decrease the amount of 239 Pu used for fissile material control measurements when applying isotope dilution mass spectrometry. The IRMM proposal is based on using a 20 % enriched uranium isotopic reference material in combination with measurements of plutonium carried out on a diluted sample. By this means the stability problems sometimes encountered in Pu solutions due to formation of colloids or precipitation can be dealt with in a diluted solution. This approach not only reduces the consumption of 239 Pu certified reference metal but also facilitates transport of spike material to on-site laboratories and operators. JRC.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of software products will reach full maturity when {{executed by the}} scheme and provides third party <b>certification.</b> For the <b>validity</b> of the <b>certification,</b> the independent laboratory must be accredited for that function, using internationally recognized standards. This brings with it a challenge for the Industrial Laboratory Testing Software (LIPS), responsible for testing the products developed in Cuban Software Industry, define strategies that will permit it to offer services {{with a high level}} of quality. Therefore it is necessary to establish a system of quality management according to NC-ISO/IEC 17025 : 2006 to continuously improve the operational capacity and technical competence of the laboratory, with a view to future accreditation of tests performed. This article discusses the process defined in the LIPS for the implementation of a Management System of Quality, from the current standards and trends, as a necessary step to opt for the accreditation of the tests performed...|$|R
2500|$|The first Shmita year in {{the modern}} State of Israel was 1951-52 (5712 in the Hebrew calendar). Subsequent Shmita years have been 1958–59 (5719), 1965–66 (5726), 1972–73 (5733), 1979–80 (5740), 1986–87 (5747), 1993–94 (5754), 2000–01 (5761), [...] 2007–08 (5768), and 2014-15 (5775). The last Shmita year began on Rosh Hashanah in September 2014, {{corresponding}} to the Hebrew calendar year 5775. The 50th year of the land, {{which is also a}} Shabbat of the land, is called [...] "Yovel" [...] in Hebrew, which is the origin of the Latin term [...] "Jubilee", also meaning 50th. According to the Torah observance of Jubilee only applies when the Jewish people live in the land of Israel according to their tribes. Thus, with the exile of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Menashe (about 600 BCE) Jubilee has not been applicable. In 2000, Sefardic Chief Rabbi Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron withdrew religious <b>certification</b> of the <b>validity</b> of permits for the sale of land to non-Jews during the Shmita year following protests against his endorsement of the leniency by members of the Haredi community.|$|R
