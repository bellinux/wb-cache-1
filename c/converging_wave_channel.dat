40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of magnetic {{field on the}} process of steepening or flattening of the characteristic wave fronts in a plane and cylindrically symmetric motion of an ideal plasma is investigated. This aspect of the problem has not been considered until now. Remarkable differences between plane, cylindrical diverging, and cylindrical <b>converging</b> <b>waves</b> are discovered. For instance, when the adiabatic index γ is 2, the magnetic field does not affect the behaviour of plane waves, but does affect cylindrical waves. As the field strength increases, the time tc taken for the shock formation varies monotonically for plane waves, while for cylindrical waves, in some situations tc exhibits a unique minimum for diverging waves and a unique maximum for <b>converging</b> <b>waves.</b> For cylindrical <b>converging</b> <b>waves,</b> a shock formation takes place if and only if, γ and the field strength are restricted to certain finite intervals. Moreover, tc is bounded in all cases except for cylindrical diverging waves. The discontinuity in the velocity gradient at the wave front is shown to satisfy a Bernoulli-type equation. The discussion of the solutions of such equations reported in the literature is shown to be incomplete, and three general theorems are established...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} goal for LIGO (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) and Virgo {{is to find}} periodic sources of gravitational waves. The LIGO and Virgo detectors are sensitive {{to a variety of}} noise of non-astrophysical origin, such as instrumental artifacts and environmental disturbances. These artifacts make it difficult to know when a signal is due to a gravitational wave or noise. A continuous wave search algorithm, Fscan, and the calculation of the coherence between the gravitational <b>wave</b> <b>channels</b> and auxiliary channels has been developed to identify the source of noise lines. The programs analyze data from the gravitational <b>wave</b> <b>channels</b> as well as environmental sensors, searching for significant lines that appear in coincidence (using various thresholds and frequency windows) in the gravitational <b>wave</b> <b>channel</b> as well the environmental monitors.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to use a new style of <b>waved</b> flow <b>channel</b> instead of the plane surface channel in the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The velocity, concentration, and electrical performance with the <b>waved</b> flow <b>channel</b> in PEMFC are investigated by numerical simulations. The results show that the <b>waved</b> <b>channel</b> arises when the transport benefits through the porous layer and improves the performance of the PEMFC. This is because the <b>waved</b> flow <b>channel</b> enhances the forced convection and causes the more reactant gas flow into the gas diffusion layer (GDL). The performance which was compared to a conventional straight gas flow channel increases significantly with the small gap size when it is smaller than 0. 5 in the <b>waved</b> flow <b>channel.</b> The performance is decreased at the high and low velocities as the force convection mechanism is weakened and the reactant gas supply is insufficient. The pressure drop is increased as the gap size becomes smaller, and the wave number decreases. (gap size) δ > 0. 3 has a reasonable pressure drop. Consequently, compared to a conventional PEMFC, the <b>waved</b> flow <b>channel</b> improves approximately 30 % of power density...|$|R

40|$|We analyse the {{non-linear}} propagation and dissipation of axisymmetric {{waves in}} accretion discs using the ZEUS- 2 D hydrodynamics code. The waves are numerically {{resolved in the}} vertical and radial directions. Both vertically isothermal and thermally stratified accretion discs are considered. The waves are generated by means of resonant forcing and several forms of forcing are considered. Compressional motions are taken to be locally adiabatic (γ = 5 / 3). Prior to non-linear dissipation, the numerical results are in excellent agreement with the linear theory of <b>wave</b> <b>channelling</b> in predicting the types of modes that are excited, the energy flux by carried by each mode, and the vertical wave energy distribution {{as a function of}} radius. In all cases, waves are excited that propagate {{on both sides of the}} resonance (inwards and outwards). For vertically isothermal discs, non-linear dissipation occurs primarily through shocks that result from the classical steepening of acoustic waves. For discs that are substantially thermally stratified, <b>wave</b> <b>channelling</b> is the primary mechanism for shock generation. <b>Wave</b> <b>channelling</b> boosts the Mach number of the wave by vertically confining the wave to a small cool region at the base of the disc atmosphere. In general, outwardly propagating waves with Mach numbers near resonance M_ r 0. 01 undergo shocks within a distance of order the resonance radius.
