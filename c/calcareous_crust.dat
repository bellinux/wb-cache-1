60|$|As {{illustrating}} {{this latter}} point, I may {{refer to the}} remarkable hooked, branched, or star-like spiculæ in many sponges, which {{are believed to have}} the function chiefly, of rendering them unpalatable to other creatures. The Holothuridæ or sea-cucumbers possess a similar protection, many of them having anchor-shaped spicules embedded in their skin, as the Synapta; while others (Cuviera squamata) are covered with a hard calcareous pavement. Many of these are of a bright red or purple colour, and are very conspicuous, while the allied Trepang, or Beche-de-mer (Holothuria edulis), which is not armed with any such defensive weapons, is of a dull sand-or mud-colour, so as hardly to be distinguished from the sea bed on which it reposes. Many of the smaller marine animals are protected by their almost invisible transparency, while those that are most brightly coloured will be often found to have a special protection, either in stinging tentacles like Physalia, or in a hard <b>calcareous</b> <b>crust,</b> as in the star fishes.|$|E
60|$|I {{carefully}} {{examined in}} many places {{the state of the}} gravel, and almost everywhere found the pebbles equally and perfectly rounded, occasionally with great blocks of rock, and generally distinctly stratified, often with parting seams of sand. The pebbles were sometimes coated with a white aluminous, and less frequently with a <b>calcareous,</b> <b>crust.</b> At great heights up the valleys the pebbles become less rounded; and as the terraces become obliterated, the whole mass passes into the nature of ordinary detritus. I was repeatedly struck with the great difference between this detritus high up the valleys, and the gravel of the terraces low down, namely, in the greater number of the quite angular fragments in the detritus,--in the unequal degree to which the other fragments have been rounded,--in the quantity of associated earth,--in the absence of stratification,--and in the irregularity of the upper surfaces. This difference was likewise well shown at points low down the valleys, where precipitous ravines, cutting through mountains of highly coloured rock, have thrown down wide, fan- shaped accumulations of detritus on the terraces: in such cases, the line of separation between the detritus and the terrace could be pointed out to within an inch or two; the detritus consisting entirely of angular and only partially rounded fragments of the adjoining coloured rocks; the stratified shingle (as I ascertained by close inspection, especially in one case, in the valley of the River Mendoza) containing only a small proportion of these fragments, and those few well rounded.|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecent researching in the Aurès {{mountains}} {{has allowed}} the discovery of 43 new prehistoric sites; from this, different stages of quaternary morphogenesis may be dated with greater precision. Thus, level VI (Morocco Moulouyan ?) slightly successed Lower Acheulean and pediment III (Morocco Tensiftian ?) is prior to Upper Paleolithic. Terrace I came after Capsien; in particular, its summit is constituted by deposits derived from a post-Neolithic soil erosion. The study of prehistoric tools shows that efficient eolisation and gelifraction occured between Upper Paleolithic and Epipaleolithic.

40|$|The {{existence}} of coral reef ecosystems critically {{relies on the}} reef carbonate framework produced by scleractinian corals and <b>calcareous</b> <b>crusts</b> (i. e., crustose coralline algae). While the Red Sea harbors {{one of the longest}} connected reef systems in the world, detailed calcification data are only available from the northernmost part. To fill this knowledge gap, we measured in situ calcification rates of primary and secondary reef builders in the central Red Sea. We collected data on the major habitat-forming coral genera Porites, Acropora, and Pocillopora and also on <b>calcareous</b> <b>crusts</b> (CC) in a spatio-seasonal framework. The scope of the study comprised sheltered and exposed sites of three reefs along a cross-shelf gradient and over four seasons of the year. Calcification of all coral genera was consistent across the shelf and highest in spring. In addition, Pocillopora showed increased calcification at exposed reef sites. In contrast, CC calcification increased from nearshore, sheltered to offshore, exposed reef sites, but also varied over seasons. Comparing our data to other reef locations, calcification in the Red Sea was in the range of data collected from reefs in the Caribbean and Indo-Pacific; however, Acropora calcification estimates were {{at the lower end of}} worldwide rates. Our study shows that the increasing coral cover from nearshore to offshore environments aligned with CC calcification but not coral calcification, highlighting the potentially important role of CC in structuring reef cover and habitats. While coral calcification maxima have been typically observed during summer in many reef locations worldwide, calcification maxima during spring in the central Red Sea indicate that summer temperatures exceed the optima of reef calcifiers in this region. This study provides a foundation for comparative efforts and sets a baseline to quantify impact of future environmental change in the central Red Sea...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTravertines can occupy two {{different}} positions, in succession of forms and formations which appear during a morphoclimatic sequence {{on the southern}} side of Aurès mountains (Algerie).

40|$|This {{experimental}} work aims {{to better understand}} the hardening process of limestone tuff after compaction when water content varies. Indeed, the pavements built with wet <b>calcareous</b> <b>crust</b> or tuff are hardened by the effect of compaction followed by water evaporation but this cohesion after compaction disappears completely by total saturation. In order to classify the materials according to geotechnical specifications related to limestone crusts, tuff from Faidh el Botmaarea was studied by following the change of compressive strength measured on specimens prepared at different water contents and stored for several days either under air (for fast drying) or in nonhermetic bags (for slow drying). The first series of specimens appeared more resistant than the second one. As explanation of the hardening, the possible precipitation of new phases such as carbonate duringthe fast drying is discussed based on chemical and microstructural observations as well as the effect of suction than could change the microstructural arrangement of tuff particles when the moisture content varies...|$|E

Physical chemical processes including calcium and inorganic phosphate levels, and exchange of gaseous {{carbon dioxide in}} both a simple closed system and a circulating system with gravel substrate have been monitored in both light and dark conditions. Further experiments were concerned with the seasonal changes in algal growth over the gravel substrate with constant water velocities and replenishment. The algal population, composed mainly of the diatoms Achnanthes minutissima, Meridion circulare, Nitzschia fonticola and Synedra ulna reached a peak in mid May and declined rapidly during June. Concentrations of phosphate phosphorus fell as the diatoms grew but was not thought to limit growth. Silicate concentrations followed the diatom cycle closely but never fell below 0. 8 mg/l Si.

40|$|International audienceDiverse, {{abundant}} and usually well-preserved communities of skeletal organisms {{occur in the}} lower Pleistocene (Gelasian) siliciclastic deposits of the Greek island of Rhodes. Benthic foraminifers, molluscs and bryozoans have been studied in four measured and sampled sections located {{in the northern part}} of the island. Among these bottom-dwelling organisms, numerous extant taxa are good environmental indicators and, combined with field observations and sedimentological data, they provide information on the probable conditions in which they developed. The siliciclastic deposits of the Kritika Formation have been divided into 14 different bio- and lithofacies, which have been further grouped into four facies associations corresponding to four different environmental settings: (1) continental to fluviatile; (2) brackish-water (lagoonal/deltaic); (3) infralittoral (0 – 20 m); and (4) upper circalittoral (depths of 20 – 40 m, but also down to c. 50 – 60 m). Among the marine facies associations, several characteristic biocoenoses have been recognized: soft-bottoms (fine to coarse sands and gravels); seagrass meadows; biogenic <b>calcareous</b> <b>crusts</b> on drowned beachrock slabs; red algal rhodoliths; and bivalve shell beds. In the studied sections, 13 superimposed genetic sequences have been documented. The repetition of similar facies associations within each sequence suggests: (1) a possibly eustasy-controlled, cyclic sedimentation; (2) a general subsidence of Rhodes during the deposition of the studied facies associations; and (3) a mostly constant range of environmental conditions (i. e. sedimentation rates and temperature) throughout the Gelasian...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSoot marks, {{witnesses}} of past human activities, {{can sometimes}} be noticed in concretions (speleothem, travertine, carbonated crust, etc.) formed in cavities. We demonstrate here that these deposits, generally ignored in archaeological studies, {{turned out to be}} a perfectly suitable material for micro-chronological study of hominin activities in a site. At the Grotte Mandrin (Mediterranean France), thousands of clastic fragments from the rock walls were found in every archaeological level of the shelter. <b>Calcareous</b> <b>crusts</b> containing soot deposits are recorded on some of their surfaces. They appear in thin section as thin black laminae. Microscopic observation of these crusts revealed that they kept track of many occupations. We show that is possible to link them with the archaeological units identified during the excavation. Minimum Number of Occupations (MNO) can be built out of these sooted crusts. MNO are usually high and attest to the cumulative nature of each archaeological unit. They are witnesses of each occupation of hominin groups in each archaeological level of the cave. This study also shows that, in Grotte Mandrin, a very short time separates the first Middle/Upper Paleolithic transitional groups' occupations from those of the last Mousterians. The research perspectives on soot deposits are diversified and raise the possibility of studying multiple aspects of past human life, and in this case, to rethink the Middle/Upper Paleolithic transition, with an unmatched temporal resolution. Sooted concretion analysis provides high temporal resolution archaeology. There is a real possibility of extending this study with chronological implications to cavities of all ages and areas...|$|R
40|$|Travertine {{deposition}} is a landscape-forming process, usually {{building a}} series of calcareous barriers differentiating the river flow into {{a series of}} cascades and ponds. The process of carbonate precipitation is a complex relationship between biogenic and abiotic causative agents, involving adapted microbial assemblages but also requiring high levels of carbonate saturation, spontaneous degassing of carbon dioxide and slightly alkaline pH. We have analysed <b>calcareous</b> <b>crusts</b> and water chemistry from four sampling sites along the Hoyoux River and its Triffoy tributary (Belgium) in winter, spring, summer and autumn 2014. Different surface textures of travertine deposits correlated with particular microenvironments and were influenced by the local water flow. In all microenvironments, we have identified the cyanobacterium Phormidium incrustatum (Nägeli) Gomont as the organism primarily responsible for carbonate precipitation and travertine fabric by combining morphological analysis with molecular sequencing (16 S rRNA gene and ITS, the Internal Transcribed Spacer fragments), targeting both field populations and cultures to exclude opportunistic microorganisms responding favourably to culture conditions. Several closely related cyanobacterial strains were cultured; however, only one proved identical with the sequences obtained from the field population by direct PCR. This strain was the dominant primary producer in the calcareous deposits under study and in similar streams in Europe. The dominance of one organism that had a demonstrated association with carbonate precipitation presented a valuable opportunity to study its function in construction, preservation and fossilisation potential of ambient temperature travertine deposits. These relationships were examined using scanning electron microscopy and Raman microspectroscopy. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Quaternary calcretes are {{widespread}} in the Mersin area and occur {{in a variety of}} forms. Several distinct calcrete profiles are recognized and subdivided into two major groups defined by mature and immature profiles. Mature calcrete profiles comprise a generally isolated calcrete horizon at the base and hard laminated crust at the top with rarely pisolithic crust in the uppermost part. The immature calcrete profiles consist mainly of an isolated calcrete horizon which is rarely overlain by a laminated crust. Calcrete forms show three main stages of development: (i) a mottled or plugged horizon, comprising isolated calcrete forms such as powdery, nodule, tube, and fracture-fill; (ii) calcareous crusts, including laminar and hard laminated calcrete crusts, and (iii) a pisolithic crust which is very restricted. The plugged horizon, in which calcite is precipitated from downward moving percolating water, reduces the permeability of the host-rocks. Later, the plugged horizon leads to the horizontal movement of percolating water with formation of a <b>calcareous</b> <b>crust.</b> Finally, a pisolithic crust forms by down-slope movement of the grains and their accumulation in troughs between dome-like structures. XRD, ICP-AES and SEM analyses show that calcrete samples are composed predominantly of calcite, and palygorskite is closely associated with them as a minor constituent. Calcite δ 18 O and δ 13 C isotope values of calcrete samples vary between – 4. 31 to – 6. 82 and – 6. 03 to – 9. 65 ‰ PDB, respectively which indicates formation from percolating meteoric water at, or near to, the surface and supporting a thin column of soil. Abundance of beta fabric constituents and negative calcite δ 13 C values suggest a pedogenic origin for the calcretes. They appear to have formed from percolating soil-derived water mainly by precipitation and replacement, and also by displacive replacement (detrital grain calcification) and biomineralization under alternating wet and dr...|$|E
40|$|Poster presentado en el Third International Congress of the European Society for Soil Conservation Man and Soil a the Third Millennium. Valencia, 28 March- 1 April, 2000 The Chafarinas {{islands are}} located in the West End of the Mediterranean Sea, near (3. 5 km) to the Moroccan coast. The islands have a {{volcanic}} origin, being the dominant parent rocks andesite and basalt, partly covered by an eroded <b>calcareous</b> <b>crust.</b> The steeped slopes and the dry climate (about 250 mm of mean annual rainfall) are responsible for the shallow « 50 cm) soils and for the aridic soil moisture regime (Lithic Torriorthents dominates). Chafarinas islands support {{one of the most important}} nesting colonies of Audouin's gull (Larus audounil), arare Mediterranean seabird. These breeding sites have been legally protected, since 1982, to avoid the gathering of eggs and other human interference that limited the growth of gull populations. In turn, the protection of the area has favoured the expansion of the more common, yellow-Iegged, seagull (Larus cachinans). The effects of such a high density of both seagulls' species on soil chemical & physical properties have become significant. On the other hand, the uncontrolled proliferation of domestic rabbits in the biggest (Congreso) island has had remarkable negative effects on herbaceous communities, shrub seedlings and in soil degradation. The Spanish Ministry for the environment, concerned about soil and plant cover conservation in the islands, has supported a research project whose preliminary findings are presented here. The presence and abundance of gulls correlated significantly to changes in chemical (nutrients, salinity, ionic ratios, organic matter, pHI and physical (bulk density, moisture retention capacity) soil properties which, in turn, were related to changes in plant cover, biomass and species composition. A model for soil-plants-fulls/rabbits interaction is proposed. Guano influence in soil properties and the associated changes in relevant plant community parameters (abundance, diversity of the shrub and herbaceous strata, above ground biomass, and soil seed bank) are quantitatively analysed. Different possibilities of soil-plant properties change tendencies (soil eutrophization, soil salinization, loss of plant cover, soil erosion), under different hypotheses of fauna management are discussed.

40|$|Specimens of a Didymium {{collected}} at Endegeest near Oegstgeest, {{a suburb of}} Leiden, on holly leaves, were put aside by Prof. Dr. W. K. H. Karstens as being near to Didymium squamulosum (Alb. & Schw.) Fries, but not identical with it. Some of the specimens were collected in August 1944 by Dr. S. J. van Ooststroom, whereas several other ones were collected in October of the following year by Prof. Karstens at the same locality; they are all very similar, and remarkable in the smooth white <b>calcareous</b> <b>crust,</b> which is distant from the membranous inner part of the peridium, and in the rather dark spores, which are nearly all encircled by a thin, sometimes fragmentary ridge. Comparison {{with a large number}} of specimens of D. squamulosum has convinced me that the specimens {{collected at}} Endegeest are indeed distinct from that species. LISTER, in a footnote to D. squamulosum (3 rd ed. 1925, p. 118), mentions a form collected on holly leaves, but the description and figure prove that this is plainly D. squamulosum, and certainly not identical with the above mentioned specimens. The specimens from Endegeest are not identical with D. praecox de Bary either. The latter is described by Lister “as so inconstant that the name cannot be applied to mark even a variety”. However, D. praecox was described by Berlese in Saccardo (Syll. 1306) and by Massee (Mon. p. 223) (the two descriptions, probably based on that given by Rostafinsky, which was not seen by me, are practically identical) as possessing a double peridium. Study of a duplicate of de Bary’s type specimen in the Rabenhorst “Fungi Europaei” collection no. 367, 1861, preserved at the Rijksherbarium at Leiden (no. 910243 - 676), shows this to be D. squamulosum, as the crystalline lime crust closely adheres to the membranous inner layer of the peridium, a condition which is characteristic of this species; this is seen quite clearly at the time of dehiscence, as the two layers break away simultaneously. The spores were found by me to be 10 - 11 µ in diam., and not 8 — 9 µ, as they are said to be in Massee’s description (which, however, comes within the range allowed for the spores of this species by Lister and by Martin in their monographs, viz. 8 - 11 µ), and they are spinulose; some of the dark spinules are grouped in clusters, whereas the remaining ones are unevenly and sparingly scattered between these clusters. In the specimens collected at Endegeest the crystalline lime layer of the peridium, as stated above, is distinctly separated from the membranous inner layer, the latter, moreover, is often provided with light brown areolae, a feature which is seen also in D. nigripes and in D. melanospermum, but which I myself have not met with in D. squamulosum. However, Lister describes the inner peridium of the latter as “sometimes mottled with red-brown towards the base”; this, therefore, is a point which deserves further study. Other noteworthy points are that the spores of the new species are provided with a ridge and that the spinules are not arranged in clusters...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The hyperarid to arid Namib Desert extends {{along the}} west coast of {{southern}} Africa. The Kuiseb River {{is one of the major}} ephemeral rivers originating in the interior highland, and crosses the Namib Desert. Fluvial terraces are well developed along the middle reaches of the Kuiseb River near Gobabeb, and are classifi ed into four surfaces: upper (H), middle 1 (M 1), middle 2 (M 2), and lower (L). Layers of calcrete are founded on the M 1 and M 2 surfaces, and gypcrete layers are founded on the H surface. Dead tree matter, buried by dune sand on the L surface, dates to 300 ± 60 years BP and 550 ± 50 years BP. The <b>calcareous</b> <b>crusts</b> on the M 1 surface date to 5, 300 ± 60 years BP and 6, 450 ± 50 years BP, and those of the M 2 surface date to 22, 070 ± 260 years BP. The presence of calcrete suggests that the ground water level was higher when the M 1 and M 2 surfaces were formed than it is at the present time. Tree size distribution on the L surface demonstrates that the L surface was also formed during a relatively wet period. It may be concluded, therefore, that these fluvial terraces record the humid periods of ca 22 ka, 5 – 6. 5 ka, and 300 – 600 years BP in the catchment area of the Kuiseb River. The presence of a water-soluble gypsum crust on the H surface suggests that the paleohydrologic environment of these terrace-forming periods probably involved increased rainfall in the interior highland east of the desert...|$|R
40|$|The {{reliability}} of a post-IR elevated temperature IRSL (290 °C; pIRIR 290) is tested on wind-blown, sand-sized (180 - 250 μm) K-rich feldspar grains. The pIRIR 290 ages {{were compared with}} quartz SAR-OSL data, other independent age controls and historical information. Three study areas {{along the coast of}} Sardinia (Italy) were selected: the south Alghero coast, the Bue Marino cave (E Sardinia) and the Alghero bay (NW Sardinia). Along the south Alghero coastline a thick dunefield system is widely recognised in the literature to represent the beginning of the last glacial phase (post 80 ka). From a single block sand-sized grains for quartz SAR-OSL and K-feldspar pIRIR dating were collected. The natural quartz SAR-OSL sample lies below the saturation limit of the dose response curve (De < 2 xD 0) giving a reliable age of 76 ± 6 ka. The fading-uncorrected pIRIR 290 age of 73 ± 5 ka is in good agreement with the quartz result. A further test on older samples was carried out on the sedimentary succession at Bue Marino cave, which includes a sandy wind-blown unit, enclosed between two <b>calcareous</b> <b>crusts.</b> U-series dates of crusts constrain the aeolianite formation between ∼ 130 and ∼ 86 ka. The quartz SAR-OSL signals for aeolianite samples lies close to saturation and the resulting ages underestimate the independent age control. Instead, uncorrected pIRIR 290 ages on K-feldspar extracts point to a formation of the wind-blown unit between ∼ 100 and ∼ 80 ka, in good agreement with the U-series data. The bleachability of the pIRIR 290 signal was further investigated using samples from a modern coastal barrier system backing the Alghero bay. The dunefield was stabilized by plantation during the 1950 s. The quartz SAR-OSL ages span from 2450 ± 170 years to 60 ± 13 years ago, consistent with the known coastal barrier stabilization. The pIRIR 290 ages indicate an offset up to ∼ 1000 years. We can conclude that the pIRIR 290 method on sand-sized K-feldspar grains shows great promise for samples at or beyond the quartz OSL age limit but should not be applied to Late Holocene or modern deposits...|$|R
40|$|For the Mediterranean area, almost 100 tsunamis were {{recorded}} in historical sources from Antiquity till present. Recordings often describe the consequences for human lives and buildings in coastal areas. However, little evidence for the geomorphic effects of tsunamis has been collected in thisregion. Tsunami run-up may destroy soil and vegetation. Tsunamis may further move extremely large volumes of coarse clastic material including individual boulders weighing more than 20 t. Trottoirs, supra- littoral cliffs, and tafoni may also be destroyed. Deepwater foraminifers deposited on land also provide evidence for Tsunami action. Recently extensively dispersed tsunami deposits were observed in southwestern and southeastern Cyprus. Field collected evidence proves tsunami action for over 60 km of coastline and about 100 - 150 m inland. Coastal areas up to 15 m asl, sometimes up to a maximum height of 30 - 50 m asl, {{have been influenced by}} tsunami action on Cyprus Island. This paper describes these deposits, their morphologic characteristics, and possibilities of relative and absolute dating. Cues for relative age determination are provided by soil and vegetation, tafoning, karstification on displaced boulders, and by post-tsunami cliff and beach rock development. Field evidence suggests that tsunamis occurred during the last few centuries. This time estimate was also supported by the absolute 14 C dating of vermetids and <b>calcareous</b> algae <b>crusts</b> on displaced boulders, and by the dating of relocated wood and charcoal. Overall, strong tsunami action can be assumed for the time between 1530 and 1821 AD...|$|R
