5|$|In 1995, {{the site}} was {{considered}} for scheduling by English Heritage, because of its national importance as {{a good example of}} a late 20th-century power station. It was also important because of its use as a testing ground for various generating sizes, from which came success in the UK's electricity industry. However, by then the station's buildings were in poor condition {{and it would have been}} financially difficult to ensure their long term preservation. Instead, it was decided a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>study</b> and photographic record of the station would be commissioned.|$|E

5|$|In his <b>comprehensive</b> <b>study,</b> Soviet Military Deception in the Second World War, Glantz {{summarized}} the Russian doctrine as involving both active and passive deception and surprise. For the Soviets, deception permeated {{all levels of}} war. And since they thought of war as just an extension of politics by other means, deception could and should be used and constantly considered in politics before a war began, if it was to work effectively.|$|E
5|$|Her {{best known}} work was a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>study</b> of Plasmodium, the malaria parasite, and {{investigation}} of various chemotherapies for the disease. Later she studied drug resistance in this parasite, research that proved valuable to the British military in World War II. She discovered {{the potential for}} cross-resistance in these parasites during that same period. Bishop also discovered the protozoan Pseudotrichomonas keilini and worked with Aedes aegypti, a malaria vector, {{as part of her}} research on the disease. Elected to the Royal Society in 1959, Bishop was the founder of the British Society for Parasitology and served on the World Health Organization's Malaria Committee.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 the United States Congress {{repealed}} mandatory {{penalties for}} cannabis offenses and The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act separated cannabis from other illicit narcotics and removed mandatory sentences {{for possession of}} small amounts of cannabis.

The Commission found that the constitutionality of cannabis prohibition was suspect and that the executive and legislative branches had a responsibility to obey the Constitution, {{even in the absence}} of a court ruling to do so.

City College's IB certificate and diploma programs provide upperclassmen access to thirty advanced studies courses, which often translate into credit hours at colleges and universities worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The Mérens, {{like many}} {{mountain}} horses, is calm, docile and hardworking. The {{report of a}} <b>comprehensive</b> <b>study</b> on the heritability of the breed's temperament was published in Equ'idée in 2010. It is a versatile breed, and very hardy, able to live all year outside without suffering from the weather. Mérens {{are known for their}} endurance, agility and sure-footedness. They require very little care, and can survive on poor food, even when working. They are resistant to cold, but react poorly to heat. Mérens foals are often born in the snow, without human intervention, but are usually handled and accustomed to humans from an early age. They show increased resistance to the anticoagulant properties of some varieties of fern, the consumption of which can cause bloody sweats and blood in the urine in other horses.|$|E
5|$|Although Beebe and {{his team}} enjoyed {{rewarding}} seasons at Rancho Grande in 1945 and 1946, they did not return there in 1947. The reason they gave in their annual report was that the previous two seasons had produced so much material that they needed an additional year to analyze it, but in reality this was more the result of insufficient funding {{as well as the}} unstable state of Venezuelan politics. Beebe returned to Rancho Grande in 1948, where he completed several technical papers about the migration patterns of birds and insects, as well as a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>study</b> of the area's ecology which he coauthored with Jocelyn Crane. Realizing that the area's politics might soon put an end to their research there, in spring of 1948 Jocelyn made a side trip to Trinidad and Tobago in hope of finding a site for a research station where the politics would be more secure. Finally, when the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'état installed Marcos Pérez Jiménez as Venezuela's dictator, Beebe decided that he could no longer continue to work in Venezuela. Beebe described his experiences at Rancho Grande in his 1949 book High Jungle, which was the last of Beebe's major books.|$|E

5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is host {{to a huge}} number of parasites and diseases, and the effect of most is unknown. Ornithologist Ted R. Anderson listed thousands, noting that his list was incomplete. The {{commonly}} recorded bacterial pathogens of the house sparrow are often those common in humans, and include Salmonella and Escherichia coli. Salmonella is common in the house sparrow, and a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>study</b> of house sparrow disease found it in 13% of sparrows tested. Salmonella epidemics in the spring and winter can kill large numbers of sparrows. The house sparrow hosts avian pox and avian malaria, which it has spread to the native forest birds of Hawaii. Many of the diseases hosted by the house sparrow are also present in humans and domestic animals, for which the house sparrow acts as a reservoir host. Arboviruses such as the West Nile virus, which most commonly infect insects and mammals, survive winters in temperate areas by going dormant in birds such as the house sparrow. A few records indicate disease extirpating house sparrow populations, especially from Scottish islands, but this seems to be rare.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} the Polish–Prussian {{alliance}} was subject to a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>study</b> {{as early as the}} 1890s, when Polish historian Szymon Askenazy published his work on the subject (Przymierze polsko-pruskie, 1900) focusing on the diplomatic and international aspects. Askenazy argued that the alliance fell more due to inept Polish diplomacy than to the Prussian realpolitik agenda; this view is not supported by majority of historians, and noted by Jerzy Łojek (who admits that himself, at the same time declaring himself, in his Geneza i obalenie Konstytucji 3 maja (1986) as sharing Askenazy's minority viewpoint). The question of to what degree the alliance was realistic, and to what degree it represented a Prussian diplomatic feint which mislead Commonwealth politicians is still debated by modern historians. Similarly, as Piotr Wandycz has noted, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} this alliance have been debated by the historians for over a century.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} {{of her career}} was spent at Cambridge's Molteno Institute for Parasite Biology, where she returned in 1929. Her work there was an extension of her research with Dobell, as she studied nuclear division in parasitic flagellates and amoebae of diverse species, including both vertebrates and invertebrates. She isolated one type of protozoan, aerotolerant anaerobes, from the digestive tract of Haemopis sanguisuga during this period. Bishop also discovered a new species, Pseudotrichomonas keilini, which she named to acknowledge her colleague David Keilin, {{as well as the}} parasite's resemblance to the genus Trichomonas. Her research at Manchester with H.P. Baynon concerned the identification, isolation, and study of the turkey blackhead parasite (Histomonas meleagridis); this study pioneered a technique for isolating and growing parasites from lesions on the liver. Bishop and Baynon were the first scientists to isolate Histomonas and then prove its role in blackhead. Bishop's expertise with parasitic protozoa translated into her best-known work, a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>study</b> of the malaria parasite (Plasmodium) and potential chemotherapies for the disease.|$|E
