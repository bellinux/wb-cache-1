30|$|The {{source of}} each video was identified. Previous studies have used ‘patient views’ and ‘university/hospital channels’ {{as sources of}} {{classifying}} the videos (Kumar et al. 2014; Sood et al. 2011; Murugiah et al. 2011). Since there were no available interviews with Ebola infected patients and no university/hospital channels in the videos included in our study, these categories were excluded. The remaining categories included ‘Independent Users or Websites’ (IU/W) (e.g. homemade videos, un-official news websites) and ‘Government Agencies/News Agencies’ (GA/NA) (e.g. Reuters, <b>CNN,</b> <b>White</b> House).|$|E

5000|$|The {{organization}} {{has come under}} fire due to its CEO Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi's comments about race and the 2016 election. Multiple disability rights bloggers objected to Mizrahi's comments. After Mizrahi's September 21, 2016 comments on her personal Facebook page, the organization stated Mizrahi did not speak for the organization. However, the following day, Mizrahi spoke on behalf of RespectAbility USA when she was quoted on <b>CNN</b> about <b>white</b> disabled voters. In response, RespectAbility issued an apology quoting Mizrahi stating, [...] "I made mistakes. I am very sorry." [...] Later the organization issued a more detailed apology.|$|R
5000|$|On May 14, 2012 it was {{reported}} by CNN [...] that in a letter obtained by <b>CNN</b> Bill <b>White</b> had withdrawn his support from Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney over his stance on gay marriage days after President Obama had stated his full support for gay marriage. In his letter, Bill White requests that Romney's campaign return his maximum contribution. <b>White</b> stated to <b>CNN</b> that while he does not support President Obama's fiscal policy, he supports him over Romney because he believed Romney would push {{for a constitutional amendment}} against gay marriage that would nullify his own marriage.|$|R
5000|$|BuzzFeed {{noted that}} the stories that Lara Trump claimed were unreported, such as the plans of Foxconn to build a factory in Wisconsin and the {{donation}} of President's Trump's salary to the Department for Education, had in fact previously been reported by broadcasters and publications sometimes described as [...] "mainstream media". Snopes and <b>CNN</b> contacted the <b>White</b> House for a comment on the videos yet received no reply.|$|R
5000|$|Donald Trump {{called the}} dossier [...] "fake news" [...] and criticized the {{intelligence}} and media sources that published it. During a press conference on January 11, 2017, Trump denounced the unsubstantiated claims as false, {{saying that it was}} [...] "disgraceful" [...] for U.S. intelligence agencies to report them. Trump refused to answer a question from <b>CNN's</b> senior <b>White</b> House correspondent Jim Acosta on the subject. In response, CNN said that it had published [...] "carefully sourced reporting" [...] on the matter which had been [...] "matched by the other major news organizations", as opposed to BuzzFeed's posting of [...] "unsubstantiated materials". James Clapper described the leaks as damaging to US national security. This also contradicted Trump's previous claim that Clapper said the information was false; Clapper's statement actually said the intelligence community has made no judgement on the truth or falsity of the information.|$|R
40|$|Deep {{convolutional}} {{neural networks}} (CNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance on visual object classification tasks. In addition, it {{is a useful}} model for predication of neuronal responses recorded in visual system. However, {{there is still no}} clear understanding of what CNNs learn in terms of visual neuronal circuits. Visualizing CNN's features to obtain possible connections to neuronscience underpinnings is not easy due to highly complex circuits from the retina to higher visual cortex. Here we address this issue by focusing on single retinal ganglion cells with a simple model and electrophysiological recordings from salamanders. By training <b>CNNs</b> with <b>white</b> noise images to predicate neural responses, we found that convolutional filters learned in the end are resembling to biological components of the retinal circuit. Features represented by these filters tile the space of conventional receptive field of retinal ganglion cells. These results suggest that CNN could be used to reveal structure components of neuronal circuits. Comment: Presented at NIPS 2017 Symposium on Interpretable Machine Learnin...|$|R

5000|$|In 2015, Hank, {{along with}} fellow online media personalities, GloZell and Bethany Mota, {{conducted}} personal interviews with United States President Barack Obama, following the 2015 State of the Union Address. Though the approach was somewhat different from previous years, having the three conduct interviews continued the White House's efforts to [...] "speak {{directly to the}} American people online." [...] Some of the questions Green and his fellow online personalities asked were collected from social media input. <b>CNN's</b> Senior <b>White</b> House correspondent, Jim Acosta was critical {{of the decision to}} have Obama be interviewed by the media personalities. Acosta stated, [...] "None of them are professional journalists. They're people who post videos on YouTube," [...] sarcastically adding, [...] "I'm just curious: Was 'Charlie Bit My Finger' or 'David After Dentist' not available?" [...] In response to Acosta, Hank tweeted, [...] "I think sometimes we need to think about how to involve people who are not reached by legacy media in the conversation. That's all." [...] Acosta subsequently replied, [...] "No sense of humor @hankgreen? Totally agree. Good luck." [...] John then defended Hank via a Tumblr post. Coincidentally, John had previously participated in a Fireside Hangout on Google+ with Obama, with the President even reciting the commonly used phrase by Nerdfighters to conclude one of his answers to John's questions.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Presentation date: 1982 - 10 - 29 In two {{breeding}} experiments, straightbred and crossbred rabbits {{were evaluated}} for performance characters relating to reproduction, disease resistance, growth and carcass quality. In the first experiment, New Zealand <b>White</b> <b>CNN)</b> and Flemish Giant (FG) straightbreds and FG sire x (Florida White-New Zealand White dam) terminal-crossbreds (TX) were involved. Reproductive performance was generally lower for small crossbred compared to straightbred doe groups, which were similar. However, doe group comparisons based on total {{production per unit}} of building area were not made. For NN straightbreds compared to FG straightbred and TX groups, litter size was larger and litter weight was heavier at 56 d and feed intake was increased. Average daily gain and 56 d weight per rabbit were larger but mortality from respiratory diseases was higher for FG straightbreds, while performance was similar between NN and TX groups. Total mortality was lowest in TX compared to straightbred litters. From carcass appraisal investigations, FG-sired progeny had more favorable body composition than NN progeny. Comparisons of terminal-crosses to straightbred groups revealed crossbred advantages for body measurement and lean yield traits. In the second experiment, three sire breeds: Californian (CC), NN and FG and four dam genetic groups: CC and NN straightbreds and Californian x New Zealand White (CN) and New Zealand White xCalifornian (NC) reciprocal crossbred does were involved. In addition,two diets were fed to does and litters, either a commercial control diet or a 74...|$|R
