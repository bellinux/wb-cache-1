50|$|As the {{war effort}} began winding down in 2011, Fisher Enterprises and Smith Enterprise ceased their {{collaboration}} and Smith made some changes to the M14 DC and renamed the new model as the Wind Talker. These features included a new baffle design, a shortened <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> made from nitrocarburized stainless steel and revolver cylinder cuts on the coupler which allowed propellant gas to exit just forward of the <b>locking</b> <b>collar.</b>|$|R
40|$|The picture {{shows the}} placing of {{a stack of}} {{stainless}} steel collars around the superconducting coils. Pre-assembled collar stacks were placed under {{and on top of}} the coils,the collars interleaving as comb teeth. During the following collaring operation of compression under a press the <b>collars</b> were <b>locked</b> together by means of side wedges. See also photos 8211532 X, 790316...|$|R
50|$|In {{pressure}} fuzed landmines this {{is achieved}} by having the fuze react differently based on {{the duration of the}} pressure impulse. For example, a number of Italian landmines like the VS-1.6 use an air system, where air is forced through a small hole into an air bladder, the inflation of which rotates a <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> and releases the striker into the detonator. The sudden impulse from impact or explosion does not have sufficient duration to inflate the bladder and rotate the <b>locking</b> <b>collar,</b> whereas steady pressure from a vehicle's wheel or track does.|$|R
50|$|In a {{synchromesh}} gearbox, {{to correctly}} match {{the speed of}} the gear to that of the shaft as the gear is engaged the collar initially applies a force to a cone-shaped brass clutch attached to the gear, which brings the speeds to match prior to the <b>collar</b> <b>locking</b> into place. The collar is prevented from bridging the locking rings when the speeds are mismatched by synchro rings (also called blocker rings or baulk rings, the latter being spelled balk in the U.S.). The synchro ring rotates slightly due to the frictional torque from the cone clutch. In this position, the dog clutch is prevented from engaging. The brass clutch ring gradually causes parts to spin at the same speed. When they do spin the same speed, there is no more torque from the cone clutch and the dog clutch is allowed to fall into engagement. In a modern gearbox, the action of all of these components is so smooth and fast it is hardly noticed.|$|R
50|$|The locking collar(Virobloc) was {{patented}} in 1955 by Marcel Opinel, and is {{only found}} on the larger Opinel models (#6 and up). While simple, the locking mechanism is quite sturdy, and converts the folding Opinel knife into nearly {{the equivalent of a}} fixed-blade knife for all practical purposes. Due {{to the way in which}} the <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> tapers, the blade does not loosen over time and can be fixed firmly even once the mechanism is quite worn. In 2000 the <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> was modified slightly to allow the blade to be locked in the closed as well as the open position. This feature prevents the blade from opening by accident when carried in a pocket.|$|R
50|$|Clamp-style shaft collars are {{designed}} {{to solve the problems}} associated with the set-screw collar. They come in one- and two-piece designs. Instead of protruding into the shaft, the screws act to compress the <b>collar</b> and <b>lock</b> it into place. The ease of use is maintained with this design and there is no shaft damage. Since the screws compress the collar, a uniform distribution of force is imposed on the shaft, leading to a holding power that is nearly twice that of set-screw collars.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that there}} were two {{distinct}} versions of the FM, depending on how the FM's light meter (see below) was activated when a motor drive was mounted. The original FM had a rotary switch shutter button <b>collar</b> to <b>lock</b> the shutter, or switch to motor drive mode when the MD-11 was mounted. The MD-12 activated the meter automatically and the switch was omitted on late (1979 or after) FMs. Nippon Kogaku also took the opportunity to construct late FMs more strongly internally than early FMs.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 {{the body}} of the {{suppressor}} was changed to titanium and this dropped the weight of the suppressor from over 2 lbs to 1.42 lbs. In 2009 Fisher designed an optional <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> for use on the M1A SOOCOM rifle, which uses a different style of flash suppressor/muzzle brake.|$|R
40|$|Two relaxometers allow {{testing of}} {{elastomers}} in various fluids. First relaxometer uses fork-like loading spacer interposed between loading lever and support ring, so that sample is stretched predetermined amount. In second relaxometer, degree of initial elongation is set {{by means of}} adjustable <b>collar,</b> which, when <b>locked</b> in place on piston rod, enables sample to be stretched predetermined length...|$|R
50|$|Collars can be {{made from}} lighter {{materials}} such as cotton, or heavier materials such as leather. Steel collars are also worn by some and lockable (metal) necklaces are also regarded as a form of collar. A very few even choose to wear permanently <b>locking</b> <b>collars</b> (these click into place and have no unlocking key), that cannot be removed except by cutting the steel.|$|R
5000|$|The National Transportation Safety Board later {{reported}} that Walton had improperly reinstalled the rear <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> {{on the elevator}} control torque tube. This allowed the torque tube to move rearward during his flight and loosened the elevator control cable tension. The outcome of the failed repair was an inflight loss of pitch control, without which Walton could not control the aircraft's altitude.|$|R
50|$|The Mark 1 {{guns were}} {{upgraded}} to Marks 5 and 8 {{in the late}} 1930s. The Mark 5's have a larger chamber to permit larger charges and a new liner with a heavier taper carbon steel along with a liner locking ring and <b>locking</b> <b>collar.</b> The Mark 8, similar to the Mark 5, had a uniform rifling with a chromium plated bore for increased life.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} Opinel {{is designed}} to be opened with two hands, and a nail nick is provided on the blade. It is possible to adjust the fitting of the safety <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> in the event that the latter is either too tight or too loose. Those practiced in the art often utilize the coup du savoyard—tap the heel of the handle hard on the table once and the blade should open slightly from the handle, allowing it to be rotated into position with the thumb.|$|R
50|$|To arm an SB-33, a small pin {{is removed}} {{from the side of the}} mine. After the mine has been armed, gradual {{pressure}} on the pressure plate (i.e. when the victim steps on it) rotates a <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> until the striker is released, which flips into a stab-detonator and the mine explodes. However, sudden pressure (e.g. from a mine-clearing charge) causes the striker to <b>lock</b> the rotating <b>collar</b> in position for the duration of the pressure, preventing the mine from detonating. The combination of low metal content and resistance to overpressure make the mine extremely difficult to remove.|$|R
50|$|The mine is {{normally}} olive green or sand-coloured and is circular with two circular bands around the circumference, which act to cushion shock when the mine is deployed from the air. The fuze is air pressure driven with {{pressure on the}} top plate of the mine forcing air into a diaphragm which exerts pressure on the striker. Shocks from overpressure are too short to inflate the diaphragm; additionally the striker must first rotate a <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> before it can activate the mine, this requires gradual pressure giving even greater resistance to shock. The sealed nature of the mine means {{that it can be}} deployed in up to 1 meter of water.|$|R
50|$|The Collar is in Gold and {{consists}} of 8 links of the emblems of the Danubian Principalities of The: Principality of Wallachia, Principality of Moldavia, Principality of Oltenia and Principality of Dobruja, 4 emblems {{on either side of}} the collar with 2 of the emblems of the House of Hohenzollern between each two Principalities; between each emblem is the monogram of King Carol I. At the back of the <b>collar</b> is the <b>lock</b> which is an Eagle with open wings which suspends in half to wear. At the front of the collar is the Steel Crown of Romania which the badge of the order suspends from.|$|R
5000|$|A {{live axle}} is {{probably}} the most common axle setup used on mini choppers. The [...] "live" [...] term indicates that the axle spins along with the wheel, sprocket, and other pieces anchored to the axle. Since the axle spins, bearings are mounted to the swing arm frame. This is a very simple axle setup, and components are relatively easy to change. Each piece, such as wheel hub, disc brake rotor, sprocket, etc., are slid onto the axle and are held in place by set screws or <b>locking</b> <b>collars.</b> The components can also be separated by bushings that are cut to the desired length. Since the axle spins, the wheel, brake, and sprocket components must be locked to the axle. This is accomplished by using a square key that fits into a groove on the axle and the components.|$|R
5000|$|A sheave {{can also}} {{refer to a}} pulley which has an {{adjustable}} operating diameter for use with a mechanical belt. This is accomplished by constructing the pulley out of several pieces. The two main [...] "halves" [...] of the pulley can be moved closer together or farther apart, thus altering the operational diameter. The usual construction {{is some sort of}} <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> or set screws to secure the components, one half with a threaded central shaft and one half with a threaded center. By rotating the components one can [...] "screw" [...] the parts closer together or further apart, thus changing the distance between the two halves and allowing the belt to ride higher or lower in the groove. The adjustments are constrained to a specific range of size and are not limitless. One application of this is the Variomatic automatic transmission.|$|R
25|$|The {{confrontation}} between Konnan and Pierroth Jr. {{was just a}} preview for their match later that night, in the semi-final position of the show. The two faced off in a Dog collar match, which meant that the two were joined together by a long steel chain that was connected to a dog collar {{around the neck of}} each competitor. The <b>collar</b> was then <b>locked</b> to prevent one of the wrestlers from getting out of the collar during the match. At some point Pierroth Jr. either stole the key from the referee, or had a spare key hidden somewhere as he was able to take off his collar, use the freedom of movement to tie up Konnan and hit him repeatedly with the steel chain. With Konnan down Pierroth Jr. was able to touch the top turnbuckle on all four corners, which was how the match was won.|$|R
40|$|A {{proposed}} {{design for}} carabiners (tether hooks used in mountaineering, rock climbing, and rescue) {{is intended to}} make it possible to operate these devices even while wearing thick gloves. According to the proposal, the gate of a carabiner would be capable of swinging either toward or away from the hook body, relative to the closed position. The gate would be spring-biased to return to the closed position. An external <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> would be pinned to an internal locking rod that would be springloaded to slide the collar longitudinally over the gate to lock the gate in the closed position. The gate would be unlocked by sliding the collar axially against the spring load. To reduce the probability of inadvertent unlocking, the rod-and-collar mechanism would include two locking buttons. Optionally, the rod-and-collar mechanism could be replaced with an external locking mechanism based on a longer collar...|$|R
50|$|Less {{well-known}} but plentiful is {{a family}} of projectors based around a design originated by Sawyer's and later sold under other brand names. That manufacturer's first slide projectors, in the late 1950s, had used straight trays. In 1963, the Sawyer's Rotomatic, the first version using circular trays (called Rototrays), was introduced. These are distinguished by the round tray being in an upright orientation, like a Ferris wheel. Unlike the Carousel tray's use of a <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> to hold the slide in the tray, the Rototray held slides in place using friction {{against the side of}} each slide. Projectors using the 100-slide Rototray were backward-compatible with the TDC-Universal straight slide trays that had been popular since the late 1950s. The 1960s would also see the introduction of a plethora of less popular tray designs, most incompatible with each other, introduced by manufacturers possibly hoping to profit from the Razor-and-blades business model.|$|R

40|$|A {{coupling}} device for tubular members of large truss structures with a <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> {{being the only}} moving part is described. Each tubular member is constructed with an end bell section that has a belled flange with a mating face, and a necked area which is smaller in diameter than the tubular members to be joined. A split ring is affixed to each tubular member and is constructed so that when two tubular members are laterally moved into axial alignment and the collar is rotated over it, the split ring loads the joint with axial forces by pressing the belled flange mating surfaces together, and a preloading force {{is provided by the}} collar mating with a taper {{on the outside of the}} split rings. All free play is thereby removed by preloaded force. A major object is to provide an ability to remove and replace individual tubular members without disturbing other structural parts of a truss structure. An additional anticipated use of this joint is to couple high pressure fluid lines...|$|R
5000|$|Most modern manual-transmission {{vehicles}} are {{fitted with a}} synchronized gear box. Transmission gears are always in mesh and rotating, but gears on one shaft can freely rotate or be locked to the shaft. The locking mechanism for a gear consists of a collar (or dog collar) on the shaft which is able to slide sideways so that teeth (or dogs) on its inner surface bridge two circular rings with teeth on their outer circumference: one attached to the gear, one to the shaft hub. When the rings are bridged by the collar, that particular gear is rotationally locked to the shaft and determines the output speed of the transmission. The gearshift lever manipulates the collars using a set of linkages, so arranged so that one collar may be permitted to lock only one gear at any one time; when [...] "shifting gears", the <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> from one gear is disengaged before that of another is engaged. One collar often serves for two gears; sliding in one direction selects one transmission speed, {{in the other direction}} selects another.|$|R
25|$|A {{lockbolt}} is {{a fastener}} {{similar to a}} bolt in appearance and function. However, instead of using screw threads which connect to a nut using a turning motion, a lockbolt has annular grooves around the shaft of the bolt (pin). After placing the lockbolt in a hole, a threadless collar is forced at high pressures around the annular grooves, deforming the <b>collar</b> and permanently <b>locking</b> it into place around the grooves. Swaging is the generic term for setting a lockbolt and collar assembly. During the installation cycle of a lockbolt, the collar is deformed around the pin with locking grooves using special tooling. The tool engages onto the pintail, which is an extra portion of pin material protruding past the collar that the tool grabs and pulls. This force on the pintail pushes the joint together, and the conically-shaped cavity of the tooling is forced down the collar, which reduces its diameter and progressively swages the collar material into the grooves of the harder pin. As the force required for swaging increases during the process, the installation is finalised when the pintail breaks off.|$|R
25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant valve spring pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of the collet halves are a taper fit into the spring retainer (also known as a <b>collar),</b> this taper <b>locks</b> the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks the collet halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the retainer, spring and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the valve spring compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the valve spring compressor above the valve stem should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|R
40|$|PT Sinar Terang Logamjaya is an {{automotive}} components manufacturer for motorcycles and car). The {{industry is}} dealing with materials from iron plate and process with sheet metal shaping techniques to produce products. One of the product is a motorcycle component, is called Oil <b>Lock</b> <b>Collar.</b> This product is been made in large quantities to meet demands. Hence, it is resulted in the workload experienced by workers and will touch on the productivity of workers. Modified Cooper Harper Scale (MCH) is a 10 -point scale that was originally produced to assess the subjective workload of airplane pilots. The original index probes overall ease of handling of the selected task or required operation and asks more specific questions related to the aircraft characteristics, the demands on the pilot, and finally, the pilot rating. This method is fit to evaluate work activities with the manual controls. MCH scale decision tree shaped with a rating scale from very easy (point 1) to very difficult (10 points). This study has two purposes. First wqs modified version of MCH scale which {{was used to measure}} the subjective workload of performing in industrial process. The second purpose was concerned with the categorizing task activities into under load category, optimal category, or overload category. Based on the framework that has been built, 8 operators were selected and they have to fill up the form to be assessed by MCH to obtain operator feel about their tasks. The results of the data processing indicate that 12 task activities were under load categorized, 5 task activities were optimal category and 11 task activities were overload category. This result can be useful for the industry to change work processes or maximum demand of products. Keywords: Subjective Workload, Framework, Measurement, Cooper Harper Scal...|$|R

Mod 6 relined Mod 2 with a uniform twist rifling along with a modified new chase hoop and locking ring. Mod 7 took the Mod 3 and used a one-step conical liner, uniform twist rifling, and added a tube and liner locking ring. Mod 8 was the Mod 0 or Mod 4 also using a one-step conical liner, uniform twist rifling that was secured by a tube and liner locking ring with a liner <b>locking</b> <b>collar</b> at the breech end. The Mod 8s that used Mod 0 guns also added a new chase hoop and locking ring.
