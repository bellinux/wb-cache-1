5|$|When Storm's father died, he {{returned}} from Amsterdam to Liverpool {{to be with his}} mother at Stormsville, at 54 Broad Green Road, Broadgreen, Liverpool. On 27 September 1972, Storm developed a chest infection and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>sleep</b> properly, so he took sleeping pills. The next day Storm and his mother were both found dead. A post mortem determined that Storm had not taken enough pills to kill himself, but it was suspected that, after finding her son's body, his mother had died.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{at the age}} of 26, O'Brien {{collapsed}} on stage during a performance, and later died due to complications after an appendicitis operation. Storm disbanded the Hurricanes and became a disc jockey, working at the Silver Blades Ice Rink in Liverpool, in Benidorm (he was also a water-skiing instructor there) in Jersey and Amsterdam. When Storm's father died, he returned from Amsterdam to Liverpool to be with his mother. He developed a chest infection and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>sleep</b> properly, so he took sleeping pills. On 28 September 1972, Storm and his mother were both found dead, at Stormsville. The post mortem revealed that Storm had alcohol and sleeping pills in his blood (as had his mother) but not enough to cause his death, which was ruled accidental. Although it could not be proven, it is thought that his mother had committed suicide after finding Storm's body.|$|E
60|$|He <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> <b>sleep</b> so {{the girls}} amused him; Fanny played and read aloud; Polly sung, and told stories; {{and did the}} latter so well, that {{it got to be}} a regular thing for her to begin as soon as {{twilight}} came, and Tom was settled in his favorite place on grandma's sofa.|$|R

5|$|Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) tells Aden that {{he should}} behave in a manner his {{grandfather}} would be proud of. This upsets Aden, and he tries to cause trouble at school. When Cassie discovers she has HIV, Aden becomes irate at the prospect {{that she may have}} infected him in the car accident. After his tests come back negative, he cries in disappointment. His doctor, Rachel Armstrong (Amy Mathews), suggests that Aden may need counselling, but he refuses. When Aden's alcoholic father Larry throws him out, he is taken in by his friend Roman. Aden is upset to learn that Roman was in the army like his grandfather, and visits the structurally damaged local diner to be alone. The ceiling collapses and Aden is seriously injured. In the aftermath, Larry tells Rachel that Aden was abused by his grandfather as a child. Aden cannot face going home, so moves in with Roman more permanently. He is attracted to Roman's daughter Nicole, but does not pursue her out of respect for Roman. Instead, Aden kisses Belle, but deflects her attempts to take things further. She goes on a date with Angelo Rosetta (Luke Jacobz), which prompts a jealous Aden to admit that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>sleep</b> with her because of the abuse he suffered as a child. When Larry injures himself while drunk, he is found by his son, and admits that Aden's grandfather also abused him. Aden holds Larry, Rachel and Belle hostage so that his father cannot receive medical assistance, but they are rescued by Angelo. Aden is forced into counselling, and begins {{to come to terms with}} his abuse.|$|E

60|$|For {{thinking}} of the keg, Dan <b>could</b> <b>not</b> get to <b>sleep,</b> and at last he arose and {{walked out into the}} living-apartment of the cabin. Here, {{in the middle of the}} floor, he came to a sudden standstill, as a noise outside reached his ears.|$|R
25|$|Chris couldn't eat for {{two days}} after his wife's murder.

He sailed back to Japan via England and was then elected to his first term in the Japanese Imperial Diet. He would serve in that position for more than 62 years, becoming one of history's longest-serving parliamentarians.|$|E
25|$|One of the Schiller Institute {{managers}} in whose apartment Duggan was staying told The Sunday Times that Duggan and his roommate {{got back to}} the house around midnight. They had no key so the manager opened the door for them. According to the roommate (speaking after Duggan's death to Duggan's girlfriend), Duggan <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>sleep</b> and kept switching the lights on and off. He said he was unable to trust LaRouche and felt trapped.|$|E
60|$|It {{was nearly}} eleven o'clock, {{and the party}} broke up. Philip <b>could</b> <b>not</b> get to <b>sleep.</b> Like the others he kept his aching feet outside the bed-clothes. He tried {{with all his might}} not to think of the life he was leading. The soldier was snoring quietly.|$|R
6000|$|It was awfully {{quiet and}} dark and lonely, out there by that creek, when the light had been put out, and we had gone to bed. For some reason I <b>could</b> <b>not</b> go to <b>sleep.</b> After I had been lying awake {{for an hour or}} two, Euphemia spoke: ...|$|R

25|$|Jim Laker {{announced}} his retirement from First Class cricket {{at the start of}} the tour because of his arthritic spinning finger, which was at times immobile and sometimes caused him so much pain that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>sleep</b> at night. Laker retired from bowling in one match, missed the next due to sunstroke and the Fourth Test because of arthritis, but played in the Fifth Test despite having a sore throat and high temperature.|$|E
25|$|On 21 February 2001, {{police arrested}} Field at his flat in Birmingham. Field {{was held in}} police custody for more than the {{lawfully}} prescribed 24 hours in order to assist the investigation. He denied knowing Tutill or having {{anything to do with}} his death, and whilst admitting to his historic offences against boys said he had put that behaviour behind him. Just before Field was put into his cell for a third night he had been asked to submit DNA samples. Field <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>sleep</b> that night and the following day he confessed in detail to the abduction, rape and murder of Tutill. He said he had seen a boy get off a bus and thumb for a lift and that he had picked him up. He said he drove the boy to a layby where he anally raped him over the front seat. He said when he finished he panicked and then strangled the boy with his own school tie, he kept the body in his car's boot for several days before dumping him in woodland.|$|E
25|$|Lü Meng {{rejected}} the coins and gold, but Sun Quan {{insisted that he}} accept. He became ill again before he was enfeoffed as a marquis. Sun Quan was at Gong'an County then so he had Lü Meng brought to his personal residence to stay with him. He also offered 1,000 jin of gold as a reward to any person who could cure Lü Meng. Sun Quan became more worried as Lü Meng's condition deteriorated over time. He wanted to see Lü Meng but {{felt that it was}} too troublesome to keep moving around, so he had a hole drilled in the wall to observe Lü Meng's room. He was happy when he saw Lü Meng having his meals, but <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>sleep</b> at night when he saw that Lü Meng did not eat anything. When Lü Meng's condition improved slightly, he was so happy that he ordered his subjects to visit Lü Meng and wish him well. He even invited Taoist priests to perform rituals to increase Lü Meng's lifespan. Despite Sun Quan's efforts, Lü Meng eventually died in Gong'an County at the age of 42 (by East Asian age reckoning). Sun Quan was extremely grieved by Lü Meng's death. Before Lü Meng died, he had instructed his family to store all their priced possessions – including gifts from Sun Quan – in a vault and return them to his lord after his death. He had also asked for a simple funeral. Sun Quan felt even more sad when found out that Lü Meng had made such arrangements before his death.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked around}} him. There {{was no place}} where he <b>could</b> <b>sleep,</b> <b>not</b> even a sofa, and taking up the candle, he moved towards the door. But a feeling of {{hesitation}} and forlornness rising, he knew not whence, made him pause irresolute before the window.|$|R
6000|$|In the {{meantime}} {{the two little}} ducklings had fallen asleep, and the little drake lay between them, covered up by their wings, to be kept warm under their feathers.

60|$|That night Dr Macphail <b>could</b> <b>not</b> get to <b>sleep</b> till late, {{and when}} he heard the missionary come upstairs he looked at his watch. It was two o'clock.

500|$|On September 19, Dannemann {{spoke with}} a {{journalist}} for the German tabloid Bild. During the interview, published on September 24, Dannemann stated: [...] "I loved him, and Jimi loved me... We were already engaged... I would then have designed the sleeves for his records... He <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>sleep.</b> So I gave him the tablets." [...] On September 20, a reporter from The Daily Telegraph interviewed Dannemann's brother, Klaus-Peter Dannemann, who stated: [...] " [...] telephoned me on [...] {{and told me that}} [...] took nine sleeping tablets. She said that Jimi had told her that he wanted to sleep for {{a day and a half}} before he went to America. She told me that he did not intend to kill himself." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the novel}} is written in a journalistic style, Frederic Svoboda writes that the {{striking}} thing about the work is [...] "how quickly it moves away from a simple recounting of events." [...] Jackson Benson believes that Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices for life in general. For example, Benson says that Hemingway drew out his experiences with [...] "what if" [...] scenarios: [...] "what if I were wounded {{in such a way}} that I <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>sleep</b> at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?" [...] Hemingway believed that the writer could describe one thing while an entirely different thing occurs below the surface—an approach he called the iceberg theory, or the theory of omission.|$|E
500|$|In {{a recent}} book about the Bomb project, Graham Farmelo wrote that [...] "Chadwick did {{more than any other}} {{scientist}} to give Churchill the Bomb.... Chadwick was tested almost to the breaking point." [...] So worried that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>sleep,</b> Chadwick resorted to sleeping pills, which he continued to take for most of his remaining years. Chadwick later said that he realised that [...] "a nuclear bomb was not only possible—it was inevitable. Sooner or later these ideas could not be peculiar to us. Everybody would think about them before long, and some country would put them into action". Sir Hermann Bondi suggested that it was fortunate that Chadwick, not Rutherford, was the doyen of UK physics at the time, as the latter's prestige might otherwise have overpowered Chadwick's interest in [...] "looking forward" [...] to the Bomb's prospects.|$|E
60|$|At Tumento Cameron {{found himself}} growing rapidly worse. He {{suffered}} from pains in the legs, and owned {{that even when}} crossing Africa during his three years of wild life he remembered nothing more severe. In my own case there was a severe tussle between Dr. Warburg and Fever-fiend. The attacks had changed from a tertian to a quotidian, and every new paroxysm left me, like the 'possessed' of Holy Writ after the expulsion of 'devils,' utterly prostrate. During the three days' struggle I drained two bottles of 'Warburg.' The admirable drug won the victory, but it <b>could</b> <b>not</b> restore <b>sleep</b> or appetite.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{something}} to tell you," [...] said the younger lady, admiring as she spoke, the length of her companion's braided hair. [...] "I intended to keep it until to-morrow, but since I came up stairs I felt I <b>could</b> <b>not</b> let you <b>sleep</b> a night under the same roof with me without knowing it. I am not Mrs Null." ...|$|R
60|$|Also we were {{in trouble}} because my brother's forepaw was broken. It gave him {{a great deal of}} pain, so that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> rest or <b>sleep.</b> After a while, however, it mended up in a fashion, but he was never able to run as fast as we could, nor did he grow so big. In the end the mother fox killed him, as I shall tell.|$|R
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1892 Mahler took the Hamburg singers to London to {{participate}} in a eight-week season of German opera—his only visit to Britain. His conducting of Tristan enthralled the young composer Ralph Vaughan Williams, who [...] "staggered home in a daze and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>sleep</b> for two nights." [...] However, Mahler refused further such invitations as he was anxious to reserve his summers for composing. In 1893 he acquired a retreat at Steinbach, on the banks of Lake Attersee in Upper Austria, and established a pattern that persisted {{for the rest of his}} life; summers would henceforth be dedicated to composition, at Steinbach or its successor retreats. Now firmly under the influence of the Wunderhorn folk-poem collection, Mahler produced a stream of song settings at Steinbach, and composed his Second and Third Symphonies there.|$|E
500|$|I {{remember}} {{not just}} because it was a win, but also because it was a big fight right into the last night. Fabrizia reminded me the other night that we had a problem with the brake pads, so we lost a lot of time. We finished three days rallying (with one day to go), night and day, 32 seconds in front of Ari Vatanen. We drove the last special stage for the night, came back to the hotel and I <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>sleep</b> at all, four hours {{in front of me and}} no sleep. Then I arrive at the special stage, it's about 42km long, and I look at Fabrizia and I said [...] "OK, we forget everything, and we are at the first stage of the rally again, because one of us will crash." [...] And so Ari hit a rock, and we won the rally.|$|E
500|$|Jackson Benson {{believes}} Hemingway used autobiographical {{details as}} framing devices {{about life in}} general—not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with [...] "what if" [...] scenarios: [...] "what if I were wounded {{in such a way}} that I <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>sleep</b> at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?" [...] Writing in [...] "The Art of the Short Story", Hemingway explains: [...] "A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit." ...|$|E
60|$|Marco said no more, and Forester {{was soon}} asleep again. Marco himself felt so much concern about his {{situation}} that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> go to <b>sleep</b> for some time. He lay watching the flames, which were creeping slowly around the logs {{which he and}} Forester had put upon the fire; for, while they had been holding the conversation above described, they had been employed in replenishing the fire.|$|R

60|$|And {{then the}} woman {{that was like a}} queen gave a very sad sigh, and it seemed to Hanrahan as if the sigh had the sound in it of hidden streams; and if the place he was in had been ten times grander and more shining than it was, he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have {{hindered}} <b>sleep</b> from coming on him; and he staggered like a drunken man and lay down there and then.|$|R
