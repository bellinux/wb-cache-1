40|$|Sixteen healthy male volunteers {{participated in}} a randomized, balanced, {{three-way}} crossover study comparing the pharmacokinetics of <b>cefmetazole,</b> cefoxitin, and <b>cefmetazole</b> with probenecid pretreatment. Single 2 -g doses of <b>cefmetazole</b> sodium and cefoxitin sodium were given intravenously as a 5 -min infusion. Concentrations of <b>cefmetazole</b> and cefoxitin were determined by using a specific semiautomated high-performance liquid chromatographic method. Concentration-time profiles of <b>cefmetazole</b> and cefoxitin declined in a biexponential manner from peak levels. Compared with cefoxitin, <b>cefmetazole</b> had a significantly (P less than 0. 05) higher mean (+/- standard error of the mean) peak concentration in serum (290 +/- 11 versus 244 +/- 10 micrograms/ml), a longer terminal disposition half-life (1. 50 +/- 0. 14 versus 0. 81 +/- 0. 04 h), lower systemic clearance (111. 7 +/- 4. 7 versus 279 +/- 12 ml/min) and renal clearance (78. 7 +/- 4. 3 versus 221 +/- 14 ml/min) of intact drug, and a slightly smaller steady-state volume of distribution (10. 3 +/- 0. 21 versus 12. 8 +/- 0. 48 liters). Mean recoveries of <b>cefmetazole</b> and cefoxitin in urine were approximately 71 and 77 %, respectively. Pretreatment of volunteers with probenecid (1 g orally) significantly (P less than 0. 05) increased concentrations of <b>cefmetazole</b> in serum 1 h after drug administration without significantly increasing maximum concentrations in serum. Mean areas under the concentration-time curve (466 +/- 27 versus 295 +/- 13 micrograms. h/ml) and terminal disposition half-lives (2. 27 +/- 0. 13 versus 1. 50 +/- 0. 14 h) of <b>cefmetazole</b> increased. Systemic clearance (72. 1 +/- 4. 0 versus 111. 7 +/- 4. 7 ml/min) and renal clearance (47. 4 +/- 4. 0 versus 78. 7 +/- 4. 3 ml/min) of intact antibiotic decreased. Mean recoveries (65. 9 +/- 3. 7 versus 71. 0 +/- 3. 2 %) of intact <b>cefmetazole</b> in urine were not significantly (P > 0. 05) different.

The other urological infections for which <b>Cefmetazole</b> was administered included prostatitis, epididymitis, urosepsis and wound infections. Fifty four patients were given <b>Cefmetazole</b> intravenously after urological operation to prevent wound and urinary tract infections. The overall clinical {{efficacy of}} <b>Cefmetazole</b> for UTI was 76. 8 %; 84. 4 % for group 1, 85. 7 % for group 3, 75 % for group 4, 44. 4 % for group 5 and 66. 6 % for group 6. In acute pyelonephritis due to E. coli, Klebsiella, Serratia, S. aureus, alpha-Streptococcus and S. epidermidis all patients were cured by <b>Cefmetazole</b> administration. Clinical efficacy of <b>Cefmetazole</b> was assessed to be excellent in 6 cases of prostatitis and 6 cases of acute epididymitis. E.

The principal adverse effect noted in the adult rats receiving the largest doses (2000 and 2500 mg/kg/day) of <b>cefmetazole</b> was slight elevation of serum alanine aminotransfcrasc. Infant rats injected subcutaneously with 300 mg/kg/ day or more of <b>cefmetazole</b> for 35 consecutive days had reversible reductions in testicular weight and maturation of spermatogenesis, but not lasting discernible effect on reproductive function.

40|$|A fast, specific, {{sensitive}} high-performance liquid chromatographic {{method for}} {{the determination of}} <b>cefmetazole</b> in human serum was developed.

Eluted components were detected by UV absorption at 254 nm. <b>Cefmetazole</b> and the internal standard were separated from interfering serum components by this method. The peak height ratio of <b>cefmetazole</b> to the internal standard was proportional to the <b>cefmetazole</b> concentration {{in the range from}} 0. 4 to 100 micrograms/ml. Serum samples obtained from three patients after a single intravenous injection of <b>cefmetazole</b> were assayed by this method and by a microbiological method.

40|$|The {{disposition}} of <b>cefmetazole</b> was studied in 25 subjects with {{various degrees of}} renal function after a 1, 000 -mg, constant-rate, 30 -min intravenous infusion of <b>cefmetazole</b> sodium. In six subjects with creatinine clearance (CLCR) of greater than 90 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2 (group 1), the terminal elimination half-life (t 1 / 2 beta) was 1. 31 +/- 0. 54 h (mean +/- standard deviation), <b>cefmetazole</b> total body clearance (CLP) was 132. 8 +/- 25. 1 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2, and volume of distribution at steady state was 0. 165 +/- 0. 025 liter/kg. The fraction of dose excreted unchanged in the urine was 84. 0 % +/- 26. 1 %. Subjects with CLCRS of 40 to 69 (group 2, n = 6) and 10 to 39 (group 3, n = 6) ml/min per 1. 73 m 2 demonstrated prolongation of the t 1 / 2 beta (3. 62 +/- 1. 06 and 5. 93 +/- 1. 81 h, respectively) and significant reductions in <b>cefmetazole</b> CLP (52. 8 +/- 14. 3 and 30. 2 +/- 10. 2 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2, respectively), compared with group 1. In seven subjects on chronic hemodialysis (group 4) studied during an interdialytic period, the <b>cefmetazole</b> t 1 / 2 beta was increased to 24. 10 +/- 8. 12 h and the CLP was reduced to 6. 8 +/- 2. 1 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2. <b>Cefmetazole</b> CLP correlated positively with CLCR (r = 0. 951, P less than 0. 001) : CLP = (1. 181.

40|$|The {{comparative}} pharmacokinetics and in vivo {{production of}} N-methylthiotetrazole (NMTT) were evaluated following administration of cefoperazone, cefotetan, and <b>cefmetazole.</b> In a randomized-crossover manner, 11 healthy male volunteers received single 2 -g intravenous doses of each agent and serial blood and urine samples were collected. Concentrations of NMTT and the parent compound in plasma, urine, and the reconstituted antibiotic solution {{were determined by}} high-pressure liquid chromatography. The amounts of NMTT administered were 6. 06 +/- 0. 46, 14. 4 +/- 0. 87, and 17. 4 +/- 1. 06 mg for cefoperazone, cefotetan, and <b>cefmetazole,</b> respectively (P less than 0. 05). The mean NMTT plasma concentration-time profiles following administration of each cephalosporin were markedly different. Six hours after dosing, NMTT concentrations in plasma following cefoperazone administration were higher than those following administration of <b>cefmetazole</b> and cefotetan. Urinary recoveries of NMTT averaged 137. 0 +/- 37. 1, 38. 3 +/- 6. 98, and 25. 2 +/- 5. 95 mg following administration of cefoperazone, cefotetan, and <b>cefmetazole,</b> respectively (P less than 0. 01). The apparent amount of NMTT produced in vivo, calculated by subtracting the amount of NMTT administered from the amount of NMTT excreted in urine, was significantly lower following <b>cefmetazole</b> administration than after administration of cefoperazone and cefotetan (P less than 0. 01).

Drug-treated volunteers received one of four doses, 0. 375, 0. 750, 1, or 2 g. The drug was well tolerated, with no adverse medical events or laboratory changes observed during the study that could affect the pharmacokinetic interpretation of the data. <b>Cefmetazole</b> concentrations were determined by using a specific high-performance liquid chromatographic method. Serum <b>cefmetazole</b> concentrations were well described by a one-compartment open model with first-order absorption and elimination. <b>Cefmetazole</b> was rapidly absorbed in most volunteers, with a mean time to maximum concentration in serum of 1. 24 +/- 0. 12 h (+/- standard error of the mean), and the mean maximum concentration in serum increased from 17. 0 +/- 1. 6 to 74. 2 +/- 9. 5 micrograms/ml over the 0. 375 - to 2 -g dose range. Maximum concentrations in serum, areas under serum concentration-time curve, and urinary excretion of intact drug increased in proportion to <b>cefmetazole</b> sodium dose. Times at which maximum concentrations in serum occurred, apparent volumes of distribution, steady-state volumes of distribution, absorption and elimination half-lives, and systemic clearances did not change significantly (P greater than 0. 05) with drug dose. Although absorption and elimination half-lives {{were not significantly different}} in 10 of 40 volunteers (P greater than 0. 05), in a majority of subjects elimination half-lives were approximately 10 times longer than absorption half-lives. The mean recovery of intact drug in urine ranged from 68. 8 to 86. 0 % over the dose range studied, with a mean recovery over all doses of 77. 1 +/- 2. 4 %.

The only infectious morbidity noted was endomyometritis. The incidence was the same in both groups, 5 / 50 (10 %) in the <b>cefmetazole</b> group and 2 / 19 (10 - 5 %) in the cefoxitin group. Febrile morbidity, as reflected in the fever index, was not significantly different between the groups, 10 - 2 ± 18 - 5 degree hours in the <b>cefmetazole</b> group and 7 - 5 ± 11 - 7 degree hours in the cefoxitin group. <b>Cefmetazole</b> appeared to be equivalent to cefoxitin in reducing post-Caesarean section endomyometritis...|$|E
40|$|Cefoxitin, cefotetan, and <b>cefmetazole</b> were {{compared}} in 10 -day therapy of intra-abdominal and subcutaneous infections caused by three organisms: Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron combined with either Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus. Intra-abdominal infection {{was caused by}} B. fragilis plus B. thetaiotaomicron plus E. coli. Therapy was initiated immediately before inoculation or was delayed for 8 h. Mortality was 14 of 30 (47 %) for saline-treated mice, and all survivors developed abscesses. Immediate therapy reduced mortality {{and the percentage of}} mice with abscesses (in survivors), respectively, to 17 and 20 % with cefoxitin, 0 and 13 % with cefotetan, and 0 and 17 % with <b>cefmetazole,</b> and the numbers of all bacteria were reduced by all the cephalosporins. Delayed therapy reduced mortality and abscess formation, respectively, to 20 and 8 % of mice with cefoxitin, 10 and 93 % with cefotetan, and 7 and 96 % with <b>cefmetazole.</b> B. thetaiotaomicron survived in all abscesses treated with cefotetan and <b>cefmetazole.</b> Subcutaneous abscesses were caused by each organism alone or in combinations of one aerobe (S. aureus or E. coli) and one or two Bacteroides species. Early therapy reduced the numbers of all bacteria independent of their in vitro susceptibility. All agents reduced the number of each Bacteroides species with either E. coli or S. aureus. However, when therapy was delayed, cefotetan and <b>cefmetazole</b> were less effective than cefoxitin against B. thetaiotaomicron. Cefotetan was the most active agent against E. coli, and <b>cefmetazole</b> was the most effective against S. aureus. These data illustrate the efficacy of all tested cephalosporins in the prophylaxis of polymicrobial infections...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} and dose proportionality of <b>cefmetazole</b> {{were studied}} in 24 healthy volunteers (12 young and 12 elderly). Each volunteer received single 0. 5 -, 1 -, and 2 -g doses of <b>cefmetazole</b> administered intravenously over 5 min {{according to a}} three-way crossover design. Serial plasma and urine samples were collected over a 24 -h period following dosing and assayed for <b>cefmetazole</b> by a high-performance liquid chromatography method. Results of the dose proportionality portion of the study indicated that <b>cefmetazole</b> pharmacokinetics are linear and proportional with dose in both age groups. Comparisons of pharmacokinetic parameters between the young and elderly groups indicated that the systemic clearance was significantly lower in elderly than in young volunteers (92. 4 versus 112 ml/min). Additionally, creatinine clearance was significantly lower in elderly (74. 1 ml/min) than in young (92. 9 ml/min) subjects. No significant differences between age groups were observed for volume of distribution, urinary recovery, terminal half-life, nonrenal clearance, or renal clearance, although half-life was slightly prolonged in elderly volunteers relative to that in young volunteers (1. 54 versus 1. 34 h), and renal clearance was slightly lower in elderly than in young volunteers (83. 7 versus 96. 1 ml/min). Both systemic and renal clearance were significantly correlated with creatinine clearance. These {{results indicate that the}} observed age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of <b>cefmetazole</b> are most likely due to differences in renal function between the two age groups. The small reduction in <b>cefmetazole</b> elimination in the elderly would not warrant dose adjustment in this population...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of <b>cefmetazole</b> versus {{that of other}} antimicrobial drugs was assessed against 374 clinical isolates of Bacteroides spp., Clostridium spp., and anaerobic gram-positive cocci. Compared with cefoxitin, <b>cefmetazole</b> showed good activity against Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. It was somewhat less active than cefoxitin against Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, B. ovatus, B. distasonis, and B. vulgatus and somewhat more active against Clostridium spp...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>cefmetazole,</b> a new cephamycin antibiotic, {{were examined}} after a 1 -h intravenous drip infusion of 1 g to 5 healthy volunteers with normal renal function and 16 patients with impaired renal function. Peak serum concentrations were obtained {{at the end}} of the infusion in all subjects, regardless of their renal function. Approximately 70 % of the infused dose was excreted in the urine within 6 h in healthy volunteers. The pharmacokinetic parameters of <b>cefmetazole</b> were derived by analyzing elimination data, with a one-compartment open model. The mean serum half-life of <b>cefmetazole</b> in healthy volunteers was 0. 81 h. A significant correlation between the elimination rate constant and the creatinine clearance was demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Seventy-nine {{patients}} {{were enrolled in}} a study comparing <b>cefmetazole</b> and cefoxitin as single agent antibiotic therapy for intra-abdominal infection. Thirty-seven patients had appendicitis, 16 patients had perforated peptic ulcer while 26 patients had {{a variety of other}} infectious processes. The clinical response to both antibiotics was good and tolerance was equivalent. Four patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the initial culture experienced microbiological failure. Three patients treated with <b>cefmetazole</b> had prolongation of the prothrombin time...|$|E
40|$|The {{comparative}} {{in vitro}} activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin, <b>cefmetazole,</b> cefoxitin, cefotetan (YM- 09330), and moxalactam against 13 isolates of Mycobacterium fortuitum was evaluated by agar dilution susceptibility testing. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin inhibited 10 to 12 strains at 6. 25 micrograms/ml, <b>cefmetazole</b> inhibited 12 of 13 strains at 12. 5 micrograms/ml, cefoxitin inhibited 11 of 13 strains at 25 micrograms/ml, and cefotetan inhibited 11 of 13 strains at 50 micrograms/ml. Moxalactam was less active {{than the other}} compounds tested, inhibiting only 9 of 13 strains at 50 micrograms/ml...|$|E
