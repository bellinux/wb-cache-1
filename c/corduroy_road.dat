5|$|There {{are over}} 60 county routes in Essex County, {{signed with the}} {{pentagonal}} county highway shields found {{in most of the}} state. The first in order is CR2, also known as <b>Corduroy</b> <b>Road</b> and Creek Road in Ticonderoga; the last is CR86E, known locally as Saint Huberts Road in Saint Huberts. In Keene, there are five county routes along NY73 that are former alignments of NY86A, which previously ran along that alignment.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{new road}} proved far more {{difficult}} than first imagined. Workers followed an old Native American trail, wholly consumed by nature, between Delhi and Port Talbot. To get across the numerous swamps, felled trees were laid across the path to create a <b>corduroy</b> <b>road,</b> much {{to the chagrin of}} settlers. The outbreak of the War of 1812 would temporarily halt further construction. When it resumed in 1816, Talbot himself began directing the surveyor, ordering that the road remain on the highest ground possible. This led to an irregular and winding route between Aylmer and Delhi. By 1830, the corduroy logs had been removed and the road improved and extended from Amherstburg to Canborough.|$|E
5|$|The Canandaigua–Pultneyville highway {{served as}} a post road {{in the years that}} followed. At some point, the section of the highway between Palmyra and Marion, {{initially}} a <b>corduroy</b> <b>road,</b> was rebuilt as a plank road and tolled. The highway fell into disrepair over the years, leading travelers to conceive ways to avoid paying toll. The toll booths were eventually removed, and the road was later covered with dirt and converted into a stage road. By the 1920s, the state of New York had assumed ownership of the Canandaigua–Pultneyville highway. In the mid-1920s, it became part of NY72, a north–south highway extending from NY52 in Naples to the Lake Ontario shoreline in Pultneyville by way of the western side of Canandaigua Lake.|$|E

50|$|In 1844, Cicero Township {{was split}} into three {{transportation}} districts, each two miles wide. The initial roads were of poor quality and mainly <b>corduroy</b> <b>roads.</b> The roads suffered considerable damage during wet seasons and were prone to seeking given the damp and low {{geography of the}} township. By 1914, railroads served the township and roads were made of gravel and macadam.|$|R
5|$|A second road in California {{was built}} by Horace Gasquet, who {{acquired}} a stand of trees at the present site of Gasquet, California— where the North and Middle Forks of the Smith River converge— in 1857. In 1881, he began to build a <b>corduroy</b> <b>road</b> from what had become Gasquet Flats to the plank road at the state line near Oregon Mountain, shown as Old Gasquet Toll Road on USGS maps. Tolls were charged starting in 1882, and in 1887 the road was completed. Gasquet also built a free road from Gasquet Flats along the Smith River {{to the mouth of}} the South Fork, including a suspension bridge across that waterway, and Del Norte County extended it along the Smith River and Mill Creek and over Howland Summit to the Crescent City Plank Road just east of Crescent City.|$|E
25|$|To {{land the}} cannon onto Tybee Island, {{artillery}} pieces were taken off transports, set on rafts at high tide, and pitched into the surf near shore. At low tide, manpower alone would drag the guns up the beach. Two {{hundred and fifty}} men were required to move a 13-inch mortar along on a sling cart. Later Union amphibious operations would employ contraband labor {{for much of this}} work. Along the two-and-a-half mile front, their engineers had to construct almost a mile of <b>corduroy</b> <b>road</b> made of bundles of brushwood to keep the guns from sinking into the swamp. While offloading proceeded day and night according to the tides, Confederate bombardment from Fort Pulaski gunners required all Federal movement into the island limited to night time. After a month of work, 36 mortars, heavy guns and rifled cannon were in position.|$|E
25|$|The BEF paused before {{attacking the}} Sambre–Oise Canal. On 5 November, 46th Division renewed the advance, the divisional {{engineers}} throwing a pontoon {{bridge across the}} canal for the artillery and transport to cross. The approaches to this bridge soon became a sea of mud, and 465th Fd Co built a <b>Corduroy</b> <b>road</b> across the fields. The heavy rain made the Petite Helpe stream impassable, but on 7 November, 468th Fd Co threw three bridges across it {{before the end of}} the day, and 465th Fd Co was brought up from crater-filling to build a motor bridge, which was completed before dark on 9 November. Meanwhile, on 8 November, 466th Fd Co commenced a bridge at Cartignies for 60-pounder guns, which were urgently needed in the pursuit of the beaten enemy. The signal company, too, was heavily involved in maintaining communications, a detachment advancing ahead of the leading brigade headquarters to prepare cables for its arrival (often re-using stretches of captured German systems). Wireless sets were also leap-frogged forwards.|$|E
50|$|<b>Corduroy</b> <b>roads</b> {{were used}} {{extensively}} in the American Civil War, between Shiloh and Corinth after the battle of Shiloh, and in Sherman's march through the Carolinas and in World War II by German and Soviet forces on the Eastern Front.|$|R

25|$|On March 29, McClernand set {{his troops}} to work {{building}} bridges and <b>corduroy</b> <b>roads.</b> They {{filled in the}} swamps in their way as well, and by April 17 they had a rough, tortuous 70-mile (110km) road from Milliken's Bend to the proposed river crossing at Hard Times, Louisiana, below Vicksburg.|$|R
500|$|Settlers {{would not}} only haul gravel for the new roadways, but they also cleared brush for the road allowance. [...] Early roads did not follow the road {{allowances}} of the Dominion Land Survey, but rather kept to higher ground, however {{due to the nature}} of the Boreal transition ecoregion, muskegs and swamps still needed to be traversed. [...] The first pioneers filled these watery areas with branches and brush and proceeded along their trip. [...] Later corduroy roads were built across these areas were traffic got mired in the mud. [...] A <b>corduroy</b> <b>road</b> consisted of logs laid across the road as a rail tie is across the rail line, however the logs were placed one against another and mud filled between the logs for a smoother surface. [...] One log provided about [...] of roadway, so only the worst areas were constructed in this fashion.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{battalion}} {{was sent}} near Luga between Pskov and Leningrad on the Saint Petersburg – Warsaw Railway. There, the men cut forest {{and built a}} [...] <b>corduroy</b> <b>road</b> over sandy soil. In September 1943, they were moved near Pskov where they dug anti-tank trenches and built other fortifications of reinforced concrete. In early 1944, it was moved to Polotsk and later Braslaw. There the unit was disbanded, the remaining men assigned to the Wehrmacht 793rd Pioneer Battalion. They retreated through Latvia into the Courland Pocket where they surrendered.|$|E
2500|$|The ARC did {{not favor}} {{use of these}} trails by trucks or {{automobile}}s, declaring in 1914 that it made [...] "no pretense of having built roads adapted for automobile travel", nevertheless by 1922 90% of the summer traffic was with motorized vehicles. Typical initial construction standards were [...] width for light traffic trails and [...] for heavier traffic trails, usually just graded through the countryside. In permafrost areas <b>corduroy</b> <b>road</b> construction techniques were used. Small streams were bridged with culverts. Initially larger streams were forded or had ferries provided (such as the ferry across the Tanana at Rika's Landing), but as time and funds permitted, larger bridging projects were carried out, such as the [...] bridge across the Tazlina River, and the [...] bridge across the Tonsina River.|$|E
50|$|The {{practice}} of building <b>corduroy</b> <b>roads</b> was common in Europe by the 18th century {{and was also}} a common form of construction in America during the post-colonial period. It involved overlapping full or half rounds of logs together transversely and was used in swampy areas as a cheap and simple method of stabilizing road foundations. With the scarcity of labour and financial resources in colonial Queensland, <b>corduroy</b> <b>roads</b> became an important and viable means of dealing with poor road conditions. Moreover, their simple method of construction meant that the employment of an engineer was not required {{as was the case}} with the more advanced and more expensive {{practice of}} building plank roads, as delineated in 1852 by Captain Payne, a former Royal Engineer, and as tabled in the New South Wales Legislative Council the following year.|$|R

2500|$|Scouting of {{the route}} began on May 16, and Mullan lead the work crew out on July 1. The road headed north to Fort Taylor, where the Snake River was crossed with pontoon boats. One man drowned during the {{crossing}}. After crossing the Snake, the crew began leaving wooden mile markers, sometimes also inscribed with information about distance to the nearest water or other useful information. An old branding iron with the letters [...] "M" [...] and [...] "R" [...] on {{it was used to}} inscribe each marker. Mullan intended the initials to mean [...] "Military Road", but the crew began using them to mean [...] "Mullan Road". The crew also made the first longitudinal observations north of 42 degrees latitude, and made maps of the territory which remained the best for another 50 years. In mid-July, the crew reached Lake Coeur d'Alene. Mullan decided to build the road on the shortest route past the lake, which was along the southern edge. Unfortunately, this meant a rapid, [...] descent into the Valley of the St. Joe River, and then an extremely difficult passage through dense timber and heavy underbrush. Massive, fallen trees blocked the route every few feet, and boulders, some of them half-buried, had to be blasted or rolled out of the way. It took eight days just to reach the valley floor. Mullan then encountered a large swamp, which his crew bridged with a <b>corduroy</b> <b>road.</b> Reaching the [...] St. Joe River, the crew built two flat-bottomed boats to serve as a ferry, since building a bridge was not practical. The work crew reached the Coeur d'Alene Mission on August 16, having blazed [...] of road.|$|E

Mr. Savine grew more and more interested in Geoffrey, who, during the second day, made great advances in the estimation of Mrs. Thomas Savine. Bicycles were not so common a woman's possession in Canada, or elsewhere, then. In fact, there were few roads in British Columbia fit to propel one on. An American friend had sent Miss Savine a wheel which, after a few journeys over a <b>corduroy</b> <b>road,</b> groaned most distressfully whenever she mounted it. Helen desired to ride in to the railroad, but the gaudy machine complained even more than usual, and when at last one of its wheels declined to revolve, Julius Savine called Geoffrey's attention to it.|$|E

60|$|It {{was well}} for us, {{that we were}} in this humour, for the road we went over that day, was {{certainly}} enough to have shaken tempers that were not resolutely at Set Fair, down to some inches below Stormy. At one time we were all flung together in a heap {{at the bottom of the}} coach, and at another we were crushing our heads against the roof. Now, one side was down deep in the mire, and we were holding on to the other. Now, the coach was lying on the tails of the two wheelers; and now it was rearing up in the air, in a frantic state, with all four horses standing on the top of an insurmountable eminence, looking coolly back at it, as though they would say 'Unharness us. It can't be done.' The drivers on these roads, who certainly get over the ground in a manner which is quite miraculous, so twist and turn the team about in forcing a passage, corkscrew fashion, through the bogs and swamps, that it was quite a common circumstance on looking out of the window, to see the coachman with the ends of a pair of reins in his hands, apparently driving nothing, or playing at horses, and the leaders staring at one unexpectedly from the back of the coach, as if they had some idea of getting up behind. A great portion of the way was over what is called a <b>corduroy</b> <b>road,</b> which is made by throwing trunks of trees into a marsh, and leaving them to settle there. The very slightest of the jolts with which the ponderous carriage fell from log to log, was enough, it seemed, to have dislocated all the bones in the human body. It would be impossible to experience a similar set of sensations, in any other circumstances, unless perhaps in attempting to go up to the top of St. Paul's in an omnibus. Never, never once, that day, was the coach in any position, attitude, or kind of motion to which we are accustomed in coaches. Never did it make the smallest approach to one's experience of the proceedings of any sort of vehicle that goes on wheels.|$|E
