5|$|Several {{methods are}} known for {{defining}} <b>cellular</b> automata rules that are reversible; these include the block <b>cellular</b> automaton method, in which each update partitions the cells into blocks and applies an invertible function separately to each block, and the second-order <b>cellular</b> automaton method, in which the update rule combines states from two previous steps of the automaton. When an automaton is not defined by one of these methods, but is instead given as a rule table, the problem of testing whether it is reversible is solvable for block <b>cellular</b> automata and for one-dimensional <b>cellular</b> automata, but is undecidable for other types of <b>cellular</b> automata.|$|E
5|$|A <b>cellular</b> {{automaton}} {{consists of}} an array of cells, each one of which has {{a finite number of}} possible states, together with a rule for updating all cells simultaneously based only on the states of neighboring cells. A configuration of a <b>cellular</b> automaton is an assignment of a state to every cell of the automaton; the update rule of a <b>cellular</b> automaton forms a function from configurations to configurations, with the requirement that the updated value of any cell depends only on some finite neighborhood of the cell, and that the function is invariant under translations of the input array.|$|E
5|$|A {{reversible}} <b>cellular</b> automaton is a <b>cellular</b> automaton {{in which}} every configuration has a unique predecessor. That is, it is a regular grid of cells, each containing a state drawn from a finite set of states, with a rule for updating all cells simultaneously based on the states of their neighbors, such that the previous state of any cell before an update can be determined uniquely from the updated states of all the cells. The time-reversed dynamics of a reversible <b>cellular</b> automaton can always be described by another <b>cellular</b> automaton rule, possibly on a much larger neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Any second-order {{automaton}} may {{be transformed}} into a conventional <b>cellular</b> automaton, in which the transition function depends only on the single previous time step, by combining pairs of states from consecutive time steps of the second-order automaton into single states of a conventional <b>cellular</b> automaton.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the motion}} of the {{particles}} in these systems is reversible, they are typically implemented with reversible <b>cellular</b> automata. In particular, both the HPP and FHP lattice gas automata can be implemented with a two-state block <b>cellular</b> automaton using the Margolus neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Boykett {{used this}} {{algebraic}} formulation {{as the basis}} for algorithms that exhaustively list all possible inequivalent reversible <b>cellular</b> automata.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cellular</b> {{automaton}} {{models of}} this system divide the square lattice into two alternating subsets, and perform updates {{on one of the}} two subsets at a time. In each update, every cell that can flip does so. This defines a reversible <b>cellular</b> automaton which can be used to investigate the Ising model.|$|E
5|$|Designing {{reversible}} {{rules for}} block <b>cellular</b> automata, and {{determining whether a}} given rule is reversible, is easy: for a block <b>cellular</b> automaton to be reversible it is necessary and sufficient that the transformation applied to the individual blocks at {{each step of the}} automaton is itself reversible. When a block <b>cellular</b> automaton is reversible, the time-reversed version of its dynamics can also be described as a block <b>cellular</b> automaton with the same block structure, using a time-reversed sequence of partitions of cells into blocks, and with the transition function for each block being the inverse function of the original rule.|$|E

5|$|Purified MAM from {{subcellular}} fractionation {{has been}} shown to be enriched in enzymes involved in phospholipid exchange, in addition to channels associated with Ca2+ signaling. These hints of a prominent role for the MAM in the regulation of <b>cellular</b> lipid stores and signal transduction have been borne out, with significant implications for mitochondrial-associated <b>cellular</b> phenomena, as discussed below. Not only has the MAM provided insight into the mechanistic basis underlying such physiological processes as intrinsic apoptosis and the propagation of calcium signaling, but it also favors a more refined view of the mitochondria. Though often seen as static, isolated 'powerhouses' hijacked for <b>cellular</b> metabolism through an ancient endosymbiotic event, the evolution of the MAM underscores the extent to which mitochondria have been integrated into overall <b>cellular</b> physiology, with intimate physical and functional coupling to the endomembrane system.|$|E
5|$|Reversible <b>cellular</b> automata form {{a natural}} model of {{reversible}} computing, {{a technology that}} could lead to ultra-low-power computing devices. Quantum <b>cellular</b> automata, one way of performing computations using the principles of quantum mechanics, are often required to be reversible. Additionally, many problems in physical modeling, such as the motion of particles in an ideal gas or the Ising model of alignment of magnetic charges, are naturally reversible and can be simulated by reversible <b>cellular</b> automata.|$|E
5|$|Several {{general methods}} {{are known for}} {{constructing}} <b>cellular</b> automaton rules that are automatically reversible.|$|E
5|$|The exosome {{is a key}} {{complex in}} <b>cellular</b> RNA quality control. Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotes possess highly active RNA {{surveillance}} systems that recognise unprocessed and mis-processed RNA-protein complexes (such as ribosomes) prior to their exit from the nucleus. It is presumed that this system prevents aberrant complexes from interfering with important <b>cellular</b> processes such as protein synthesis.|$|E
5|$|The nucleus is {{the largest}} <b>cellular</b> {{organelle}} in animal cells.|$|E
5|$|The time-reversed {{dynamics}} of the automaton can be described by another <b>cellular</b> automaton. Clearly, {{for this to be}} possible, the update rule must be bijective. In the other direction, if the update rule is bijective, then it has an inverse function that is also bijective. This inverse function must be a <b>cellular</b> automaton rule. The proof of this fact uses the Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem, a topological characterization of <b>cellular</b> automata rules as the translation-invariant functions that are continuous with respect to the Cantor topology on the space of configurations.|$|E
5|$|There are no nontrivial {{reversible}} elementary <b>cellular</b> automata. However, a near-miss {{is provided}} by Rule 90 and other elementary <b>cellular</b> automata based on the exclusive or function. In Rule 90, the state of each cell is the exclusive or of the previous states of its two neighbors. This use of the exclusive or makes the transition rule locally invertible, {{in the sense that}} any contiguous subsequence of states can be generated by this rule. Rule 90 is not a reversible <b>cellular</b> automaton rule, because in Rule 90 every assignment of states to the complete array of cells has exactly four possible predecessors, whereas reversible rules are required to have exactly one predecessor per configuration.|$|E
5|$|Viruses infect all <b>cellular</b> life and, {{although}} viruses occur universally, each <b>cellular</b> {{species has}} its own specific range that often infect only that species. Some viruses, called satellites, can replicate only within cells {{that have already been}} infected by another virus.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann {{created the}} field of <b>cellular</b> automata {{without the aid of}} computers, {{constructing}} the first self-replicating automata with pencil and graph paper. The concept of the Von Neumann universal constructor based on the von Neumann <b>cellular</b> automaton was fleshed out in his posthumous work Theory of Self Reproducing Automata.|$|E
5|$|Coimbatore has a well-connected {{communications}} infrastructure. Till the 1990s {{the state}} owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) {{was the only}} telecommunication service provider in the city. In the 1990s, private telecom companies too started offering their services. , BSNL, Reliance Communications, Bharti Airtel and Tata Teleservices offer broadband service and fixed line services. MTS offers mobile broadband services. <b>Cellular</b> telephony was first introduced in 1997 and mobile telephone services available. Coimbatore is {{the headquarters of the}} Tamil Nadu circle of <b>cellular</b> service providers.|$|E

5|$|Google and Asus omitted <b>cellular</b> {{connectivity}} on initial {{models of}} the device, instead employing Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n as the only means for the tablet to connect to the Internet. A mobile-capable version of the device utilizing HSPA+ <b>cellular</b> technology with 32 GB of storage was later introduced in October 2012 for $299. Unlike most tablets, the Nexus7 has NFC connectivity built in, which allows users to share files quickly with Android Beam and perform non-touch payments at sites that employ NFC cash registers.|$|E
5|$|Immunology {{made a great}} advance {{towards the}} end of the 19th century, through rapid developments, in the study of humoral {{immunity}} and <b>cellular</b> immunity. Particularly important was the work of Paul Ehrlich, who proposed the side-chain theory to explain the specificity of the antigen-antibody reaction; his contributions to the understanding of humoral immunity were recognized by the award of a Nobel Prize in 1908, which was jointly awarded to the founder of <b>cellular</b> immunology, Elie Metchnikoff.|$|E
5|$|Many other <b>cellular</b> automata {{and other}} {{computational}} systems {{are capable of}} emulating the behavior of Rule 90. For instance, a configuration in rule 90 may be translated into a configuration into the different elementary <b>cellular</b> automaton Rule 22. The translation replaces each Rule 90 cell by three consecutive Rule 22 cells. These cells are all zero if the Rule 90 cell is itself zero. A nonzero Rule 90 cell is translated into a one followed by two zeros. With this transformation, every six steps of the Rule 22 automaton simulate a single step of the Rule 90 automaton. Similar direct simulations of Rule 90 are also possible for the elementary <b>cellular</b> automata Rule 45 and Rule 126, for certain string rewriting systems and tag systems, and in some two-dimensional <b>cellular</b> automata including Wireworld. Rule 90 can also simulate itself in the same way. If each cell of a Rule 90 configuration {{is replaced by a}} pair of consecutive cells, the first containing the original cell's value and the second containing zero, then this doubled configuration has the same behavior as the original configuration at half the speed.|$|E
5|$|Other {{methods for}} elucidating the <b>cellular</b> {{location}} of proteins requires {{the use of}} known compartmental markers for regions such as the ER, the Golgi, lysosomes or vacuoles, mitochondria, chloroplasts, plasma membrane, etc. With the use of fluorescently tagged versions of these markers or of antibodies to known markers, it becomes much simpler to identify the localization of a protein of interest. For example, indirect immunofluorescence will allow for fluorescence colocalization and demonstration of location. Fluorescent dyes are used to label <b>cellular</b> compartments for a similar purpose.|$|E
5|$|The Critters rule is a block <b>cellular</b> {{automaton}} in which, at each step, {{the cells}} of the automaton are partitioned into 2×2 blocks and each block is updated independently of the other blocks. Its transition function flips the state of every cell in a block that does not have exactly two live cells, and in addition rotates by 180° blocks with exactly three live cells. Because this function is invertible, the automaton defined by these rules is a reversible <b>cellular</b> automaton.|$|E
5|$|The {{cell nucleus}} was {{discovered}} by Robert Brown in 1831. Demonstration of the <b>cellular</b> composition of all organisms, with each cell possessing all the characteristics of life, is attributed to the combined efforts of botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann (1810–1882) in the early 19th century although Moldenhawer had already shown that plants were wholly <b>cellular</b> with each cell having its own wall and Julius von Sachs had shown the continuity protoplasm between cell walls.|$|E
5|$|The iPad {{comes with}} several pre-installed applications, {{including}} Safari, Mail, Photos, Videos, YouTube, Music, iTunes, App Store, Maps, Notes, Calendar, Game Center, Photo Booth, and Contacts. Like all iOS devices, the iPad can sync content {{and other data}} with a Mac or PC using iTunes, although iOS 5 and later can be managed and backed up without a computer. Although the tablet is not designed to make phone calls over a <b>cellular</b> network, users can use a headset or the built-in speaker and microphone and place phone calls over Wi-Fi or <b>cellular</b> using a VoIP application, such as Skype. The device has dictation, using the same voice recognition technology as the iPhone 4S. The user speaks and the iPad types what they say on the screen provided that the iPad is connected to a Wi-Fi or <b>cellular</b> network.|$|E
25|$|A <b>cellular</b> {{automaton}} (pl. <b>cellular</b> automata, abbrev. CA) is {{a discrete}} model studied in computability theory, mathematics, physics, complexity science, theoretical biology and microstructure modeling. <b>Cellular</b> automata are also called <b>cellular</b> spaces, tessellation automata, homogeneous structures, <b>cellular</b> structures, tessellation structures, and iterative arrays.|$|E
25|$|A <b>cellular</b> {{automaton}} is reversible if, {{for every}} current {{configuration of the}} <b>cellular</b> automaton, there is exactly one past configuration (preimage). If one thinks of a <b>cellular</b> automaton as a function mapping configurations to configurations, reversibility implies that this function is bijective. If a <b>cellular</b> automaton is reversible, its time-reversed behavior can also {{be described as a}} <b>cellular</b> automaton; this fact is a consequence of the Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem, a topological characterization of <b>cellular</b> automata. For <b>cellular</b> automata in which not every configuration has a preimage, the configurations without preimages are called Garden of Eden patterns.|$|E
25|$|Reversible <b>cellular</b> automata {{are often}} used to {{simulate}} such physical phenomena as gas and fluid dynamics, since they obey the laws of thermodynamics. Such <b>cellular</b> automata have rules specially constructed to be reversible. Such systems have been studied by Tommaso Toffoli, Norman Margolus and others. Several techniques {{can be used to}} explicitly construct reversible <b>cellular</b> automata with known inverses. Two common ones are the second order <b>cellular</b> automaton and the block <b>cellular</b> automaton, both of which involve modifying the definition of a <b>cellular</b> automaton in some way. Although such automata do not strictly satisfy the definition given above, it can be shown that they can be emulated by conventional <b>cellular</b> automata with sufficiently large neighborhoods and numbers of states, and can therefore be considered a subset of conventional <b>cellular</b> automata. Conversely, {{it has been shown that}} every reversible <b>cellular</b> automaton can be emulated by a block <b>cellular</b> automaton.|$|E
25|$|A {{representative}} <b>cellular</b> assay is {{the mixed}} lymphocyte culture (MLC) {{and used to}} determine the HLA class II types. The <b>cellular</b> assay is more sensitive in detecting HLA differences than serotyping. This is because minor differences unrecognized by alloantisera can stimulate T cells. This typing is designated as Dw types. Serotyped DR1 has cellularly defined as either of Dw1 or of Dw20 and so on for other serotyped DRs. Table shows associated <b>cellular</b> specificities for DR alleles. However, <b>cellular</b> typing has inconsistency in the reaction between cellular-type individuals, sometimes resulting differently from predicted. Together with difficulty of <b>cellular</b> assay in generating and maintaining <b>cellular</b> typing reagents, <b>cellular</b> assay is being replaced by DNA-based typing method.|$|E
