40|$|Ba c k g r o u n d: There {{is ample}} {{epidemiologic}} and toxicologic evidence {{that exposure to}} fine particulate matter (PM) air pollution [aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2. 5 µm (PM 2. 5) ], which derives primarily from combustion processes, can result in increased mortality and morbidity. There is less certainty as to the contribution of coarse PM (PM 2. 5 – 10), which derives from crustal materials and from mechanical processes, to mortality and morbidity. Obj e c t i v e: To determine whether coarse PM causes cardiopulmonary effects, we exposed 14 healthy young volunteers to coarse concentrated ambient particles (<b>CAPs)</b> <b>and</b> <b>filtered</b> air.

Objective: To determine whether coarse PM causes cardiopulmonary effects, we exposed 14 healthy young volunteers to coarse concentrated ambient particles (<b>CAPs)</b> <b>and</b> <b>filtered</b> air.

Results: Compared with filtered air exposure, coarse CAP exposure produced a small increase in polymorphonuclear neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 20 hr postexposure, indicating mild pulmonary inflammation. We observed no changes in pulmonary function. Blood tissue plasminogen activator, which is involved in fibrinolysis, was decreased 20 hr after exposure. The standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), a measure of overall heart rate variability, also decreased 20 hr after exposure to CAPs. Conclusions: Coarse CAP exposure produces a mild physiologic response in healthy young volunteers approximately 20 hr postexposure. These changes are similar in scope and magnitude to changes we and others have previously reported for volunteers exposed to fine CAPs, suggesting that both size fractions are comparable at inducing cardiopulmonary changes in acute exposure settings.

40|$|Background: Ambient coarse, fine, and {{ultrafine}} particles {{have been}} associated with mortality and morbidity. Few studies have compared how various particle size fractions affect systemic biomarkers. Objectives: We examined changes of blood and urinary biomarkers following exposures to three particle sizes. Methods: Fifty healthy nonsmoking volunteers, mean age of 28 years, were exposed to coarse (2. 5 – 10 μm; mean, 213 μg/m 3) and fine (0. 15 – 2. 5 μm; mean, 238 μg/m 3) concentrated ambient particles (<b>CAPs),</b> <b>and</b> <b>filtered</b> ambient and/or medical air. Twenty-five participants were exposed to ultrafine CAP (3 ̆c 0. 3 μm; mean, 136 μg/m 3) <b>and</b> <b>filtered</b> medical air. Exposures lasted 130 min, separated by ≥ 2 weeks. Blood/urine samples were collected preexposure and 1 hr and 21 hr postexposure to determine blood interleukin- 6 and C-reactive protein (inflammation), endothelin- 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; vascular mediators), and malondialdehyde (lipid peroxidation); as well as urinary VEGF, 8 -hydroxy-deoxy-guanosine (DNA oxidation), and malondialdehyde.

40|$|Several {{initiatives}} are currently emerging {{to observe the}} exchange of energy and matter between the earth's surface and atmosphere standardized over larger space and time domains. For example, the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and the Integrated Carbon Observing System (ICOS) are set to provide the ability of unbiased ecological inference across ecoclimatic zones and decades by deploying highly scalable and robust instruments and data processing. In the construction of these observatories, enclosed infrared gas analyzers are widely employed for eddy covariance applications. While these sensors represent a substantial improvement compared to their open- and closed-path predecessors, remaining high-frequency attenuation varies with site properties and gas sampling systems, and requires correction. Here, we show that components of the gas sampling system can substantially contribute to such high-frequency attenuation, but their effects can be significantly reduced by careful system design. From laboratory tests we determine the frequency at which signal attenuation reaches 50  % for individual parts of the gas sampling system. For different models of rain <b>caps</b> <b>and</b> particulate <b>filters,</b> this frequency falls into ranges of 2. 5 – 16. 5  Hz for CO 2, 2. 4 – 14. 3  Hz for H 2 O, and 8. 3 – 21. 8  Hz for CO 2, 1. 4 – 19. 9  Hz for H 2 O, respectively. A short and thin stainless steel intake tube was found to not limit frequency response, with 50  % attenuation occurring at frequencies well above 10  Hz for both H 2 O and CO 2. From field tests we found that heating the intake tube <b>and</b> particulate <b>filter</b> continuously with 4  W was effective, and reduced the occurrence of problematic relative humidity levels (RH [*]>[*] 60  %) by 50  % in the infrared gas analyzer cell. No further improvement of H 2 O frequency response was found for heating in excess of 4  W. These laboratory and field tests were reconciled using resistor–capacitor theory, and NEON's final gas sampling system was developed on this basis. The design consists of the stainless steel intake tube, a pleated mesh particulate <b>filter</b> <b>and</b> a low-volume rain <b>cap</b> in combination with 4  W of heating and insulation. In comparison to the original design, this reduced the high-frequency attenuation for H 2 O by [*]≈[*] 3 ∕ 4, and the remaining cospectral correction did not exceed 3  %, even at high relative humidity (95  %). The standardized design can be used across a wide range of ecoclimates and site layouts, and maximizes practicability due to minimal flow resistance and maintenance needs. Furthermore, due to minimal high-frequency spectral loss, it supports the routine application of adaptive correction procedures, and enables largely automated data processing across sites...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the pricing <b>and</b> hedging of <b>caps</b> <b>and</b> swaptions using term {{structure}} models. Cap prices mainly depend on variances of forward interest rates, whereas swaption prices also {{depend on the}} correlations between these forward rates. We therefore compare onefactor models, that imply perfectly correlated interest rates, with multi-factor models, using US data on <b>cap</b> <b>and</b> swaption prices for 1995 until 1999. The <b>caps</b> <b>and</b> swaptions data contain wide ranges of both option maturities and maturities of the underlying interest rates and swaps.
