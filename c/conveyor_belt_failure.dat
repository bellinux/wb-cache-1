Overland <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> systems form a {{vital part}} of modern transportation systems in the mining and mineral processing industries. It is vital that the system is well maintained in order to minimise system downtime and maximise profit. The <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> is the single most expensive item in the system. It must be monitored to pick up potential problems before they cause <b>belt</b> <b>failure.</b> The majority of <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> monitoring methods identify <b>belt</b> <b>failure</b> events rather than <b>belt</b> <b>failure</b> causes. The purpose of this project was to research and design a belt condition monitoring board which could be physically embedded in the <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt.</b> This would then be used to monitor the condition of the conveyor idlers whose failure can result in major system damage. The venture was split into two areas of research: the design of a vibration data logging board and the design of a power generation system.

40|$|While {{there is}} a clear impact of aerosol {{particles}} on the radiation balance, whether and how aerosol particles influence precipitation is controversial. Here we use the ECHAM 6 -HAM global climate model coupled to an aerosol module to analyse whether an impact of anthropogenic aerosol particles on the timing and amount of precipitation can be detected in North Pacific warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts.</b> Warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> are the strongest precipitation-producing airstreams in extratropical cyclones and are identified here with a Lagrangian technique, i. e. by objectively identifying the most strongly ascending trajectories in North Pacific cyclones. These <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> have been identified separately in 10 -year ECHAM 6 -HAM simulations with present-day and pre-industrial aerosol conditions. Then, the evolution of aerosols and cloud properties has been analysed in detail along the identified warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> trajectories. The results show that, under present-day conditions, some warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> trajectories are strongly polluted (i. e. high concentrations of black carbon and sulfur dioxide) due to horizontal transport from eastern Asia to the oceanic region where warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> start their ascent. In these polluted trajectories a weak delay and reduction of precipitation formation occurs compared to clean warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> trajectories. However, all warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> consist of both polluted and clean trajectories at the time they start their ascent, and the typically more abundant clean trajectories strongly reduce the aerosol impact from the polluted trajectories. The main conclusion then is that the overall amount of precipitation is comparable in pre-industrial conditions, when all warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> trajectories are clean, and in present-day conditions, when warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> consist of a mixture of clean and polluted trajectories...|$|R
