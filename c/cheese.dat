5|$|Mass-produced pizza <b>cheese</b> {{is used by}} the foodservice industry, quick service restaurants, {{and other}} {{industries}} and businesses. The world's largest manufacturer of pizza <b>cheese,</b> Leprino Foods Company, processes 600,000 tonnes (590,000 long tons; 660,000 short tons, 1,322,760,000 pounds) a year. Leprino Foods holds patents for some specialized Mozzarella production processes that enable the quick manufacture of the product. One such product is a frozen shredded <b>cheese</b> used for pizza that is created in a few hours from milk. Other U.S. companies also mass-produce pizza <b>cheese,</b> which is shipped in a frozen state. As of 2000, Glanbia is the largest producer of pizza <b>cheese</b> in Europe. Some retail and commercially mass-produced frozen pizzas have <b>cheese</b> stuffed into the pizza crust.|$|E

Some may incorporate other seafoods in addition to crab, such as imitation crab, lobster, shrimp and surimi. Additional ingredients may include mushrooms, artichoke, onion, green onion, shallot, green pepper, bread crumbs (such as panko), heavy cream and others. Bread crumbs {{may be used to}} top the dish, which may be browned during the cooking process creating a crust. Sometimes Parmesan <b>cheese</b> is combined with the bread crumbs.

40|$|Capsular and ropy {{microbial}} exopolysaccharides (EPS) {{produced by}} selected strains of Streptococcus thermophilus {{were used to}} make low-fat mozzarella <b>cheeses</b> containing 6 % fat in a small-scale pilot study. The effects of EPS on moisture retention and textural and functional characteristics were investigated over 28 days of storage at 4 °C. Texture profile analysis (TPA), meltability, stretchability, and pizza bake performance were analysed. Control <b>cheeses</b> made with non-EPS strains had the lowest moisture content of 53. 77 %. Control <b>cheeses</b> exhibited poor meltability and stretchability and greater hardness, springiness and chewiness. Capsular and ropy EPS increased moisture retention in <b>cheeses</b> to 57. 17 % and 58. 39 %, respectively, and EPS was isolated from curd at 31. 09 mg/g and 51. 65 mg/g, respectively. <b>Cheeses</b> made with EPS were softer, showed lower degree of springiness and chewiness and exhibited better stretchability and meltability as compared to control <b>cheeses,</b> although meltability of capsular EPS <b>cheeses</b> was not significantly different to the control (p> 0. 05).

40|$|International audienceThis paper aims to {{estimates}} {{the willingness to}} pay (WTP) of French consumers for the 5 Auvergne PDO <b>cheeses,</b> namely “Cantal”, “Saint Nectaire”, “Bleu d'Auvergne”, “Fourme d'Ambert” and “Salers”. To do this, Firstly, we compare the consumers’ choice for the Auvergne’s <b>cheeses</b> with PDO label between them with a mixed logit model (MXL). Secondly and based on this estimates, we deduce the WTP of consumers for the attributes of each product. Finally, we add in our sample the PDO <b>cheeses</b> from other regions like “Roquefort" and “Comté”, and the no-PDO <b>cheeses</b> like “Camembert”, “Coulommier” and “Other blue cheese”, this allows us to compare the consumer’s choice for the Auvergne PDO <b>cheeses</b> with other French PDO and no-PDO <b>cheeses</b> from others region. As main results, {{we found that the}} attributes of product influence more the purchases of the products compared to the individual characteristics of consumers. Moreover, among the Auvergne PDO <b>cheeses,</b> consumer’s willing to pay on average + 1. 794 €/kg and + 2. 3 €/kg for PDO “Cantal” and PDO “Bleu Auvergne” respectively. While, they willing to pay on average - 5. 208 €/kg, - 0. 489 €/kg and - 6. 406 €/kg for the PDO “St Nectaire”, the PDO “Fourme Ambert” and the PDO “Salers” respectively. We also found that the Auvergne PDO <b>cheeses</b> are better sold in their region of origin than the no-PDO and the PDO <b>cheeses</b> from other regions, which reflects an ethnocentrism of consumers in this region. Finally, the calculation of utilities shows that consumers prefer in first choice the no-PDO <b>cheeses,</b> then the PDO <b>cheeses</b> from other regions, and finally the Auvergne PDO <b>cheeses.</b> We conclude that the Auvergne PDO <b>cheeses</b> and the PDO <b>cheeses</b> from other regions should review their marketing strategy in order to better compete with no-PDO <b>cheeses.</b> The major contribution {{of this paper is to}} be the first empirical paper to assess the determinants of choice and a WTP of consumers for the 5 Auvergne PDO <b>cheeses</b> with original data from Kantar WorldPanel...|$|R

5|$|Certain {{types of}} cheeses require {{inoculation}} of milk curds with fungal species that impart a unique flavor and texture to the <b>cheese.</b> Examples include the blue color in cheeses such as Stilton or Roquefort, {{which are made}} by inoculation with Penicillium roqueforti. Molds used in <b>cheese</b> production are non-toxic and are thus safe for human consumption; however, mycotoxins (e.g., aflatoxins, roquefortine C, patulin, or others) may accumulate because of growth of other fungi during <b>cheese</b> ripening or storage.|$|E
5|$|Globally, Mozzarella is {{the most}} popular pizza <b>cheese.</b> However, it has been {{estimated}} that in the United States only 30% of all pizza <b>cheese</b> used is actual Mozzarella. Provolone is the second most popular one. Cheddar may be mixed with Mozzarella to preserve chewiness. Grated Parmesan may be added to the top of a pizza, and typically does not melt well when cooked. A diverse variety of processed pizza cheeses are produced, including analogue <b>cheese.</b> Provel is one example. Other pizza cheeses include Emmental, Romano and Ricotta for calzones or as a topping.|$|E
40|$|Ovine <b>cheeses</b> were {{manufactured}} from {{raw milk}} (R), pasteurized milk without starter addition (P), and pasteurized milk with starter addition (PS), using {{in all cases}} extracts of Cynara cardunculus as rennet and mimicking {{as far as possible}} the traditional manufacture process. The microbial counts were higher in (R) <b>cheeses</b> than in (P) <b>cheeses,</b> and the lowest microbial counts were found for (PS) <b>cheeses.</b> Such physicochemical characteristics as moisture, fat, protein, NaCl content, and pH of the three types of <b>cheeses</b> were similar to one another at each sampling time. In particular, pasteurization had no significant effect on protein breakdown as evaluated by either the water-soluble nitrogen, the trichloroaceticacid (TCA) -soluble nitrogen, or the phosphotungstic acid (PTA) -soluble nitrogen fractions. However, the TCA-soluble and the PTA-soluble fractions for the PS <b>cheeses</b> ripened for more than 28 days were higher than those for the (R) or (P) <b>cheeses</b> at similar ripening times. The <b>cheeses</b> and their water-soluble extracts could not be distinguished by urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for up to 7 days, but clear differences were apparent at 68 days of ripening for the (PS) <b>cheeses</b> with respect to the (R) and (P) <b>cheeses...</b>|$|R
40|$|One {{hundred and}} twenty-two samples of <b>cheeses</b> made from goat and sheep milk and {{a mixture of}} the two types, {{produced}} in Southern Italy by industrial establishments or artisans, were analysed {{for the detection of}} fungal contamination and the presence of potentially toxigenic moulds. Only organoleptically acceptable <b>cheeses</b> without evident fungal contamination were studied.
