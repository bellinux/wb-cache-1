50|$|Born in Phnom Penh in 1875, Sisowath Monivong was {{the sixth}} {{child and the}} second son of King Sisowath. His mother was Neak Moneang Van, later titled Samdeach Preah Voreachini, the fifth child-bearing wife of Sisowath. At that time his uncle King Norodom ruled from Odong, the capital of Cambodia. Norodom was a puppet king for the French <b>colonial</b> <b>protectorate.</b> In 1884, after the French conquered Laos and {{occupied}} Vietnam, Cambodia became a direct colonial possession. The royal family then moved from Odong to the new capital of Phnom Penh, where Sisowath Monivong resided.|$|E
5000|$|Spanish forces {{returned}} to Djerba in 1520, {{and this time}} were successful in capturing the island. It was twice occupied by Spain, from 1521 to 1524 and from 1551 to 1560; again there were governors: 1521-1524 ..., 1560 Giovanni Andrea Doria. On May 14, 1560, the Ottoman fleet, {{under the command of}} Piali Pasha and Dragut, severely defeated the [...] "Holy League" [...] of Philip II of Spain at the Battle of Djerba. From that time until 1881, Djerba belonged to the Ottoman regency of Tunis. Subsequently, it came under the French <b>colonial</b> <b>protectorate,</b> which became the modern republic of Tunisia.|$|E

40|$|Scholarship on Australia's <b>colonial</b> <b>protectorates</b> has {{examined}} {{the ways in which}} protectors largely failed in their humanitarian mission, as well as the ambivalent roles they played as agents of ‘civilisation’. Yet as well as representing ‘friends and benefactors’ of Aboriginal people, colonial protectors worked to bring them within the legal reach of police, courts and prisons. This article will compare the work of the protectorates during the 1840 s in Port Phillip and South Australia with that of Western Australia, where a more systematic and forebodingly modern policy of Aboriginal governance existed. It argues that in Western Australia a logic of Aboriginal protection emerged through a principle of discipline and punishment facilitated by the distinctive policy regime of Governor Hutt.

5000|$|The British signed two further {{treaties}} with Al Khalifa in 1880 and 1892, putting {{the defense and}} foreign relations of Bahrain in the control of Britain and turning Bahrain into a British <b>colonial</b> <b>protectorate.</b> Following an incident in 1904, in which a relative of the ruler attacked Persians and Germans, the ruler agreed to place foreigner affairs in British hands. The term [...] "foreigner" [...] was vague, because Bahrain had no naturalization policy, population census or emigration office. This and the rapidly growing number of foreigners {{as a result of}} the pearl boom created a dual authority system, one led by the British agent and the other by the Al Khalifa ruler (Isa bin Ali).|$|E
5000|$|... it is a {{well known}} fact that the Itsekhiri Kingdom had no king or {{standing}} army because of the INTERREGNUM as at then, {{and that the only}} militarized force they had was that of Chief Nana Olumo who was exiled after his forces were defeated by the British several years back. So why would Admiral Kennedy take back to Britain the War-flag of a [...] "none existing" [...] Itsekhiri Army he never saw or engaged in battle? Why would the Itsekhiri Kingdom lay a claim to a War-Flag or Banner when they had no standing king or Army as at 1897, since they had already been annexed into the British <b>colonial</b> <b>protectorate</b> as at then? ...|$|E
50|$|The {{town was}} the scene of many events during and in the {{aftermath}} of World War II and it was occupied by several foreign countries during the war (Vichy France, Thailand, Imperial Japan, Free France, and Nationalist China). Initially the Vichy French controlled the city but lost it to Thai forces following the Franco-Thai War of 1940-1941. On 9 March 1945, a nationalist group declared Laos once more independent, with Luang Prabang as its capital but on 7 April 1945 two battalions of Japanese troops occupied the city. The Japanese attempted to force Sisavang Vong (the King of Luang Phrabang) to declare Laotian independence but on 8 April he instead simply declared an end to Laos' status as a French protectorate. The King then secretly sent Prince Kindavong to represent Laos to the Allied forces and Sisavang Vatthana as representative to the Japanese. Following Japan's surrender to the Allies, Free French forces were sent to reoccupy Laos and entered Luang Prabang on 25 August, at which time the King assured the French that Laos remained a French <b>colonial</b> <b>protectorate.</b> In September the Chinese Nationalist forces arrived to receive the surrender of the remaining Japanese forces but also quickly set about buying up the Laotian opium crop.|$|E
50|$|The CEFEO {{was largely}} {{made up of}} voluntarily-enlisted {{indigenous}} tirailleurs from the French Union <b>colonial</b> or <b>protectorate</b> territories in the Maghreb (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, and South-East Asia. An exception was the French Foreign Legion which consisted mainly of European volunteers (including French, Spaniards, Poles, and most notably Germans).|$|R
50|$|In November 1951, Margai {{oversaw the}} {{drafting}} of a new constitution, which united the separate <b>Colonial</b> and <b>Protectorate</b> legislatures and - most importantly - provided a framework for decolonisation. In 1953, Sierra Leone was granted local ministerial powers, and Margai was elected Chief Minister of Sierra Leone. The new constitution ensured Sierra Leone a parliamentary system within the Commonwealth of Nations.|$|R

5000|$|The French {{language}} {{was introduced to}} Laos in the 19th century when French explorers arrived in Laos trying to make inroads into China after colonizing Vietnam. The French did not {{pay much attention to}} the kingdom of Lan Xang but established a counsulate in present-day Luang Prabang. [...] The actual catalysts for the establishment of <b>colonial</b> <b>protectorate</b> over Lao cultural regions were French fears of economic and political competition from Britain. [...] By the 1890s, border disputes with Siam and France led to the Franco-Siamese War and the borders of Laos and Siam were established in favor of France and Laos became a French protectorate. Unlike in Vietnam, the French did not pursue to fully exert their influence in Laos and {{it was not until the}} 1900s that French began to be introduced into schools in Laos, but it was mostly limited to Vientiane. However, French rule finally gained firmer ground and French soon became the primary language of government and education and the language spread into southern Laos following the founding of Pakse. The French language peaked between the 1910s and World War II and spread throughout the nation but, like Vietnam, was not widely spoken in most rural areas. French eventually became the language of government officials and the elite. When Japan invaded Laos in World War II, French remained in the educational system, unlike in Vietnam, where Vietnamese became the sole language of education, but the Lao {{language was}} briefly used in the government. French returned as the sole political language after France resumed its rule of Laos and was co-official with Lao when Laos was granted self-rule in 1949, but Lao became the sole official language after independence in 1953.|$|E
40|$|General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck’s East African Campaign was a {{conventional}} war of movement. Lettow based his operations {{on the military}} principles deduced from his thorough German military education and oversea deployments to China and German South West Africa. Upon assignment to German East Africa, he sought to convert the colony’s protectorate force from a counterinsurgency force to {{a conventional}} military force. His conventional strategy succeeded early in the war, especially at the Battle of Tanga in October 1914. However, his strategy failed as the war in East Africa intensified. He suffered a calamitous defeat at the Battle of Mahiwa in November 1917, and the heavy losses forced Lettow to adopt the counterinsurgency tactics of the <b>colonial</b> <b>protectorate</b> force...|$|E
50|$|Conquest of Paradise {{focuses on}} the New World. It adds an {{expansion}} to the mechanics of tribal nations, most prominently Native American ones. It also adds a random new world generator which randomizes the landscape of North and South America. The accompanying 1.5 patch also added <b>colonial</b> regions, <b>protectorates</b> and new starting nations {{as well as many}} other small additions and fixes. It was released 11 January 2014.|$|R
50|$|The latter {{happened}} in North Africa: the Beys/Deys of Tunis and Algiers established themselves as 'regencies' and even Egypt went {{its own way}} under its great khedive Mohammed Ali - they would in turn be subjected to European <b>colonial</b> dominance, as <b>protectorates,</b> of France and Britain.|$|R
50|$|The Chinese Protectorate was an {{administrative}} body {{responsible for the}} well-being of ethnic Chinese residents of the Straits Settlements during that territory's British <b>colonial</b> period. <b>Protectorates</b> were established in each area of the Settlements, namely Singapore, Penang and Malacca. Each was headed by a Protector. The institution was established in 1877 to handle all matters related to the Straits Settlements' Chinese residents. In particular, it sought to mitigate the human rights violations of the coolie trade, which had expanded to notorious levels by the 1850s in the region.|$|R
50|$|In 1955, Cyprus decimalized with 1000 mils (μιλς, mil) to the pound. The {{system was}} based on a proposal, {{presented}} to the British parliament in 1881, to introduce a decimal currency system into the United Kingdom. The political debate on decimalising British coinage had been going on since 1824, but the 1881 motion failed to gain parliamentary approval and so the mil-system was never introduced into the United Kingdom itself. Instead it was used in various British <b>colonial</b> and <b>protectorate</b> territories, including Palestine from 1927, and Cyprus from 1955.|$|R
50|$|In September 1940, Vichy France {{was forced}} to allow Japan to occupy French Indochina, a {{federation}} of French <b>colonial</b> possessions and <b>protectorates</b> encompassing modern day Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The Vichy regime continued to administer them under Japanese military occupation. French Indochina was the base for the Japanese invasions of Thailand, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies. In 1945, under Japanese sponsorship, the Empire of Vietnam and the Kingdom of Kampuchea were proclaimed as Japanese puppet states.|$|R
50|$|Conditions {{regarding}} protection {{are generally}} much less generous for areas of <b>colonial</b> protection. The <b>protectorate</b> was often {{reduced to a}} de facto condition similar to a colony, but using the pre-existing native state {{as an agent of}} indirect rule. Occasionally, a protectorate was established by or exercised by the other form of indirect rule: a chartered company, which becomes a de facto state in its European home state (but geographically overseas), allowed to be an independent country which has its own foreign policy and generally its own armed forces.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a brief summary}} of the Yên Bay mutiny of 10 February 1930, before examining its links to a wider insurrectionary attempt by the Vietnamese Nationalist Party in parts of Tonkin and {{the reasons why the}} attempted insurrection was to begin at Yên Bay but not in other garrison towns. It then places the mutiny in a context in which the use of Vietnamese soldiers in French service was necessary in order to maintain French supremacy as a <b>colonial</b> and <b>protectorate</b> power in French Indo-China. But instead of focusing on the mutiny itself and its causes, the main emphasis of this paper is on its consequences – in terms of the military and civilian policies subsequently adopted by the French. These included disciplinary measures, changes in the military and civilian intelligence services, as well as policies reducing the relative number of Vietnamese troops. While these measures aimed at reasserting French control and discipline in a key colonial institution, the conclusion briefly discusses their impact on the defence capability of French Indo-China and on the nature of French–Vietnamese relations...|$|R
50|$|The French {{protectorate}} of Cambodia (ប្រទេសកម្ពុជាក្រោមអាណាព្យាបាលបារាំង, Protectorat français du Cambodge), {{refers to}} the Kingdom of Cambodia {{when it was a}} French protectorate within French Indochina — a collection of Southeast Asian protectorates within the French <b>Colonial</b> Empire. The <b>protectorate</b> was established in 1867 by when the Cambodian King Leggio Norodom requested the establishment of a French protectorate over his country, meanwhile Siam (modern Thailand) renounced suzerainty over Cambodia and officially recognised the French protectorate on Cambodia. Cambodia was integrated into the French Indochina union in 1887 along with the French colonies and protectorates in Vietnam (Cochinchina, Annam and Tonkin). In 1946, Cambodia was granted self-rule within the French Union and had its protectorate status abolished in 1949. Cambodia later gained its independence and the independent day was celebrated on 9 November 1953.|$|R
