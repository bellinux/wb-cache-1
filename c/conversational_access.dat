To be competitive, enterprises must integrate their supply chains moreeffectively and forge close memberships with customers and suppliers more quickly. Consequently, technologies {{must be developed}} that enable enterprises to respond toconsumer demand more quickly, integrate with suppliers more effectively, adapt to market variations more efficiently and evolve product designs with manufacturing practicesmore seamlessly. The mission of the Extended-Enterprise Coalition for Integrated Collaborative Manufacturing Systems coalition is to research, develop, and demonstratetechnologies to enable the integration of manufacturing applications in a multi-company supply chain planning and execution environment. We believe real-time andasynchronous collaboration technology will {{play a critical role}} in allowing manufacturers to increase their supply chain agility. We are realizing our efforts through our VirtualSituation Room (VSR) technology. The primary goal of the VSR technology is to enhance current ad-hoc, limited methods and mechanisms for spontaneous, real-timecommunication using feature-rich, industry standards-based building blocks and network protocols.

40|$|Dialog state {{tracking}} (DST) is {{a crucial}} component in a task-oriented dialog system for <b>conversational</b> information <b>access.</b> A common practice in current dialog systems is to define the dialog state {{by a set of}} slot-value pairs. Such representation of dialog states and the slot-filling based DST have been widely employed, but suffer from three drawbacks. (1) The dialog state can contain only a single value for a slot, and (2) can contain only users' affirmative preference over the values for a slot. (3) Current task-based dialog systems mainly focus on the searching task, while the enquiring task is also very common in practice. The above observations motivate us to enrich current representation of dialog states and collect a brand new dialog dataset about movies, based upon which we build a new DST, called enriched DST (EDST), for flexible accessing movie information. The EDST supports the searching task, the enquiring task and their mixed task. We show that the new EDST method not only achieves good results on Iqiyi dataset, but also outperforms other state-of-the-art DST methods on the traditional dialog datasets, WOZ 2. 0 and DSTC 2.

40|$|Intelligent Information Access {{techniques}} {{attempt to}} overcome the limitations of current search devices by providing personalized information items and product/service recommendations. They normally utilize direct or indirect user input and facilitate the information search and decision processes, according to user needs, preferences and usage patterns. Recent developments {{at the intersection of}} Information Retrieval, Information Filtering, Machine Learning, User Modelling, Natural Language Processing and Human- Computer Interaction offer novel solutions that empower users to go beyond single-session lookup tasks and that aim at serving the more complex requirement: “Tell me what I don’t know that I need to know”. Information filtering systems, specifically recommender systems, have been revolutionizing the way information seekers find what they want, because they effectively prune large information spaces and help users in selecting items that best meet their needs and preferences. Recommender systems rely strongly on the use of various machine learning tools and algorithms for learning how to rank, or predict user evaluation, of items. Information Retrieval systems, on the other hand, also attempt to address similar filtering and ranking problems for pieces of information such as links, pages, and documents. But they generally focus on the development of global retrieval techniques, often neglecting individual user needs and preferences. The book aims to investigate current developments and new insights into methods, techniques and technologies for intelligent information access from a multidisciplinary perspective. It comprises six chapters authored by participants in the research event Intelligent Information Access, held in Cagliari (Italy) in December 2008. In Chapter 1, Enhancing <b>Conversational</b> <b>Access</b> to Information through a Socially Intelligent Agent, Berardina De Carolis, Irene Mazzotta and Nicole Novielli emphasize the role of Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) as a natural interaction metaphor for personalized and context-adapted access to information. They propose a scalable architecture for the development of ECAs able to exhibit an emotional state and/or social signs. VI Preface The automatic detection of emotions in text is the problem investigated in Chapter 2, Annotating and Identifying Emotions in Text, by Carlo Strapparava and Rada Mihalcea. The authors describe the “Affective Text” task, presented at SEMEVAL- 2007. The task focused on classifying emotions in news headlines, and was intended to explore the connection between emotions and lexical semantics. After illustrating the data set, the rationale of the task and {{a brief description of the}} participating systems, several experiments on the automatic annotation of emotions in text are presented. The practical applications of the task are very important. Consider for example opinion mining and market analysis, affective computing, natural language interfaces for e-learning environments or educational games. Personalization of the ranking computed by search engines and recommender systems is the main topic of Chapter 3, Improving Ranking by Respecting the Multidimensionality and Uncertainty of User Preferences, by Bettina Berendt and Veit Koppen. The research question addressed by the authors is whether system ranking is the “right ranking” for the user, based on the context in which she/he operates. A general conceptualization of the ranking-evaluation task is proposed: the comparison between the ranking generated by a computational system, and the “ user’s ideal ranking”. Eight challenges to this simple model are discussed, leading to the conclusion that approaches for dealing with multidimensional, and often only partial, preference orders are required and that randomness could be a beneficial feature of system rankings. In Chapter 4, Hotho reviews the state of the art in the new research area of data mining on folksonomies. The first part describes the basics of folksonomies, summarizing del. icio. us, the most popular social bookmarking system, and illustrates in detail BibSonomy, a very successful online service for social bookmarking and publication sharing. Starting from these systems, the author discusses in greater depth the main issues regarding folksonomies, proposing a formal model and presenting their most important network properties. In the second part, the author illustrates three applications: spam detection, ranking and recommendation. Regarding spam detection, the author develops techniques, based on binary classifiers, which prevent spammers from publishing in social bookmarking systems. As far as ranking is concerned, a new algorithm is proposed, namely FolkRank, which takes into account the folksonomy structure for ranking users, tags and resources. For recommendation, the author evaluates a tag recommender based on Collaborative Filtering, a graph based recommender using FolkRank and several simple approaches based on tag counts. In the third part, a possible link between folksonomies and ontologies is suggested, paving the way to some very promising strategies for detecting organizational principles hidden within folksonomies. Amati, Amodeo, Bianchi, Gaibisso and Gambosi propose, in Chapter 5, A Uniform Theoretic Approach to Opinion and Information Retrieval, an application of the Divergence From Randomness (DFR) model to the Preface VII opinion finding task, the task of retrieving opinionated blog posts, relevant for a given topic, from a large collection. The opinion finding task can be seen as a search in which, after the standard retrieval of ranked documents, documents are re-ranked according to the presence of opinions within the selected documents. This task can be handled by a supervised or unsupervised method. The authors propose a method for creating a lexicon of opinionated terms for re-ranking the documents, using a supervised algorithm. The first part introduces the statistical basis underpinning the proposed approach and its adoption in opinion retrieval. In particular, two information-theoretic functions are defined, opinion entropy and average opinion entropy. The authors also formally describe their lightweight opinion retrieval algorithm. Lastly, the authors discuss the effectiveness of their approach for creating a dictionary of polarity-bearing terms. They also describe some preliminary experiments and propose alternative ways to approach the polarity detection problem. In Chapter 6, A Suite of Semantic Web Tools Supporting Development of Multilingual Ontologies, Pazienza, Stellato and Turbati propose a suite of software libraries, tools and ontologies to support multilingual development of Semantic Web ontologies. The three tools illustrated in this Chapter are Semantic Turkey, The Linguistic Watermark, and Ontoling. Semantic Turkey is aimed at providing innovative solutions for web browsing and for gathering and organizing the information observed when surfing the net. The novel aspect of Semantic Turkey is its ability to provide a clear separation between acquired data and web links. The Linguistic Watermark is an ontological and software framework for describing and managing heterogeneous linguistic resources and for using their contents for ontological-driven document enrichment. Ontoling is a generic architecture for extending ontology development tools with functionalities for enriching ontological knowledge with linguistic content. The tools presented implicitly embed a new way of rethinking the development of ontologies in terms of making their content reusable and comprehensible. Furthermore, they represent living proof of software engineering principles associated with software reuse, documentation, modularity, interaction analysis, applied to the domain of Knowledge Management Software.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} two {{techniques}} {{to improve the}} ef-fectiveness of a conversational tutoring system when interacting with groups of users. First, we propose the usage of linguistic features derived from discourse parsing {{to better understand the}} structure of the ongo-ing dialogue between the students and the tutoring system. Discourse parsing gives us the relational structure of a dialogue, and can be used to improve the tutoring system’s understanding of conversation struc-ture. Second, we discuss dialogue planning using contextual information stored in a Contextual Knowledge Base (CKB). A <b>conversational</b> agent with <b>access</b> to a information about linguistic and environmental context will be able to respond to changing conditions in ways that a simple question answering agent is not capable of. We present previous empiri-cal results for these two tasks and discuss how they can be incorporated into an Intelligent Tutoring System...|$|R
40|$|The main {{contributions}} of this thesis revolve around {{development of an}} integrated conversational recommendation system, combining data and information models with community network and interactions to leverage multi-modal information access. We have developed a real time <b>conversational</b> information <b>access</b> community agent that leverages community knowledge by pushing relevant recommendations to users of the community. The recommendations are delivered {{in the form of}} web resources, past conversation and people to connect to. The information agent (cobot, for community/ collaborative bot) monitors the community conversations, and is 'aware' of users' preferences by implicitly capturing their short term and long term knowledge models from conversations. The agent leverages from health and medical domain knowledge to extract concepts, associations and relationships between concepts; formulates queries for semantic search and provides socio-semantic recommendations in the conversation after applying various relevance filters to the candidate results. The agent also takes into account users' verbal intentions in conversations while making recommendation decision. One of the goals of this thesis is to develop an innovative approach to delivering relevant information using a combination of social networking, information aggregation, semantic search and recommendation techniques. The idea is to facilitate timely and relevant social information access by mixing past community specific conversational knowledge and web information access to recommend and connect users with relevant information. Language and interaction creates usable memories, useful for making decisions about what actions to take and what information to retain. Cobot leverages these interactions to maintain users' episodic and long term semantic models. The agent analyzes these memory structures to match and recommend users in conversations by matching with the contextual information need. The social feedback on the recommendations is registered in the system for the algorithms to promote community preferred, contextually relevant resources. The nodes of the semantic memory are frequent concepts extracted from user's interactions. The concepts are connected with associations that develop when concepts co-occur frequently. Over a period of time when the user participates in more interactions, new concepts are added to the semantic memory. Different conversational facets are matched with episodic memories and a spreading activation search on the semantic net is performed for generating the top candidate user recommendations for the conversation. The tying themes in this thesis revolve around informational and social aspects of a unified information access architecture that integrates semantic extraction and indexing with user modeling and recommendations.

40|$|Keywords: Cooperative Principle, Conversational Maxims, Humor, Jokelopedia. In human communication, the {{participants}} must speak cooperatively {{to be understood}} in a particular way. The cooperative principle, along with the four conversational maxims, describes how effective and efficient communication in conversation is achieved. However, comedians often purposefully flouted these maxims for the humorous effect of their story. The writer conducted a study {{about the role of}} cooperative principle, more specifically, the flouting of conversational maxims in the creation of humor in narrative jokes in Jokelopedia: The Biggest, Best, Siliest, Dumbest, Joke Book Ever!. This study aims at finding out the flouted maxims in the narrative jokes, the implicature in the narrative jokes, and how the implicature is expected to create humorous effect in the narrative jokes. This study focuses on the flouting of conversational maxims in three chapters with the most number of narrative jokes in Jokelopedia. This study uses qualitative approach in relation to the use of clear and systematic description about the phenomena being studied. Descriptive study in textual analysis is applied in this study to analyze the narrative jokes in the book. This study reveals that all conversational maxims are flouted in order to create humorous effect in the narrative jokes. From 40 narratives analyzed by the researcher, maxim of relation is the mostly flouted maxim with 15 occurrences. The maxim of quantity is the second with 10 occurrences. Then, the maxim of quality and manner are the least flouted maxims with 9 and 6 occurrences. These flouting of <b>conversational</b> maxims gives <b>access</b> to hidden meanings called implicature with which humorous effect is generated. Mostly, the implicature is expected to create humorous effect by showing a contrast between the development of the reader 2 ̆ 7 s expectation and the fact in the story, or by showing the foolish or inappropriate behavior of the characters. The conclusion of the study shows that humor can be invoked by the flouting of conversational maxims. In addition, the emergence of the humor caused by the flouting of maxims also depends on the interpretation of the readers and their encyclopedic knowledge. The writer suggests future researchers to use other theories such as Leech 2 ̆ 7 s politeness principle or Sperber & Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s relevance theory, to find other materials such as visual and auditory media as the source of data, and to analyze the humorous effect which is not caused by the flouting of conversational maxims...|$|R
40|$|Evolution in {{the area}} of mobile {{computing}} has been phenomenal in the last few years. The exploding increase in hardware power has enabled multimodal mobile interfaces to be developed. These interfaces differ from the traditional graphical user interface (GUI), in that they enable a more “natural” communication with mobile devices, through the use of multiple communication channels (e. g., multi-touch, speech recognition, etc.). As a result, a new generation of applications has emerged that provide human-like assistance in the user interface (e. g., the Siri conversational assistant (Siri Inc., visited 2010)). These conversational agents are currently designed to automate a number of tedious mobile tasks (e. g., to call a taxi), but the possible applications are endless. A domain of particular interest is that of Cultural Heritage, where conversational agents can act as personalized tour guides in, for example, archaeological attractions. The visitors to historical places have a diverse range of information needs. For example, casual visitors have different information needs from those with a deeper interest in an attraction (e. g., - holiday learners versus students). A personalized <b>conversational</b> agent can <b>access</b> a cultural heritage database, and effectively translate data into a natural language form that is adapted to the visitor’s personal needs and interests. The present research aims to investigate the information needs of a specific type of visitors, those for whom retention of cultural content is important (e. g., students of history, cultural experts, history hobbyists, educators, etc.). Embodying a conversational agent enables the agent to use additional modalities to communicate this content (e. g., through facial expressions, deictic gestures, etc.) to the user. Simulating the social norms that guide the real-world human-to-human interaction (e. g., adapting the story based on the reactions of the users), should at least theoretically optimize the cognitive accessibility of the content. Although a number of projects have attempted to build embodied conversational agents (ECAs) for cultural heritage, little is known about their impact on the users’ perceived cognitive accessibility of the cultural heritage content, and the usability of the interfaces they support. In particular, there is a general disagreement on the advantages of multimodal ECAs in terms of users’ task performance and satisfaction over nonanthropomorphised interfaces. Further, little is known about what features influence what aspects of the cognitive accessibility of the content and/or usability of the interface. To address these questions I studied the user experiences with ECA interfaces in six user studies across three countries (Greece, UK and USA). To support these studies, I introduced: a) a conceptual framework based on well-established theoretical models of human cognition, and previous frameworks from the literature. The framework offers a holistic view of the design space of ECA systems b) a research technique for evaluating the cognitive accessibility of ECA-based information presentation systems that combine data from eye tracking and facial expression recognition. In addition, I designed a toolkit, from which I partially developed its natural language processing component, to facilitate rapid development of mobile guide applications using ECAs. Results from these studies provide evidence that an ECA, capable of displaying some of the communication strategies (e. g., non-verbal behaviours to accompany linguistic information etc.) found in the real-world human guidance scenario, is not affecting and effective in enhancing the user’s ability to retain cultural content. The findings from the first two studies, suggest than an ECA has no negative/positive impact on users experiencing content that is similar (but not the same) across different locations (see experiment one, in Chapter 7), and content of variable difficulty (see experiment two, in Chapter 7). However, my results also suggest that improving the degree of content personalization {{and the quality of the}} modalities used by the ECA can result in both effective and affecting human-ECA interactions. Effectiveness is the degree to which an ECA facilitates a user in accomplishing the navigation and information tasks. Similarly, affecting is the degree to which the ECA changes the quality of the user’s experience while accomplishing the navigation and information tasks. By adhering to the above rules, I gradually improved my designs and built ECAs that are affecting. In particular, I found that an ECA can affect the quality of the user’s navigation experience (see experiment three in Chapter 7), as well as how a user experiences narrations of cultural value (see experiment five, in Chapter 8). In terms of navigation, I found sound evidence that the strongest impact of the ECAs nonverbal behaviours is on the ability of users to correctly disambiguate the navigation of an ECA instructions provided by a tour guide system. However, my ECAs failed to become effective, and to elicit enhanced navigation or retention performances. Given the positive impact of ECAs on the disambiguation of navigation instructions, the lack of ECA-effectiveness in navigation could be attributed to the simulated mobile conditions. In a real outdoor environment, where users would have to actually walk around the castle, an ECA could have elicited better navigation performance, than a system without it. With regards to retention performance, my results suggest that a designer should not solely consider the impact of an ECA, but also the style and effectiveness of the question-answering (Q&A) with the ECA, and the type of user interacting with the ECA (see experiments four and six, in Chapter 8). I found that that there is a correlation between how many questions participants asked per location for a tour, and the information they retained after the completion of the tour. When participants were requested to ask the systems a specific number of questions per location, they could retain more information than when they were allowed to freely ask questions. However, the constrained style of interaction decreased their overall satisfaction with the systems. Therefore, when enhanced retention performance is needed, a designer should consider strategies that should direct users to ask a specific number of questions per location for a tour. On the other hand, when maintaining the positive levels of user experiences is the desired outcome of an interaction, users should be allowed to freely ask questions. Then, the effectiveness of the Q&A session is of importance to the success/failure of the user’s interaction with the ECA. In a natural-language question-answering system, the system often fails to understand the user’s question and, by default, it asks the user to rephrase again. A problem arises when the system fails to understand a question repeatedly. I found that a repetitive request to rephrase the same question annoys participants and affects their retention performance. Therefore, in order to ensure effective human-ECA Q&A, the repeat messages should be built in a way to allow users to figure out how to ask the system questions to avoid improper responses. Then, I found strong evidence that an ECA may be effective for some type of users, while for some others it may be not. I found that an ECA with an attention-grabbing mechanism (see experiment six, in Chapter 8), had an inverse effect on the retention performance of participants with different gender. In particular, it enhanced the retention performance of the male participants, while it degraded the retention performance of the female participants. Finally, a series of tentative design recommendations for the design of both affecting and effective ECAs in mobile guide applications in derived from the work undertaken. These are aimed at ECA researchers and mobile guide designers...|$|R
