50|$|For waters {{where the}} {{direction}} of the related fairway is not obvious, such as where there are fairways leading in several directions or where there is navigable water outside designated fairways, <b>cardinal</b> <b>marks</b> are often used instead of lateral ones. These give {{the direction of}} safe water as a cardinal direction (north, east, south or west) relative to the mark.|$|R
50|$|Charts {{will show}} lighthouses, lateral buoy, <b>cardinal</b> <b>marks</b> and other navigational aids. In the ports, {{facilities}} will be mapped (port wall, pier, walkways, docks, fueling stations, loading cranes, access roads, railway lines, ferry lines). Similarly, public authorities, shipbuilders and repairers, {{as well as}} sanitation and utility facilities will be displayed. The navigational attributes correspond to the international standard IHO S-57.|$|R

50|$|Sometimes a <b>Cardinal</b> <b>Mark</b> can be {{used instead}} of a Special mark to {{indicate}} a spoil ground, or an outfall pipe for example. A few examples {{can be seen on}} the South Coast of England and in Northern France.|$|E
50|$|Construction {{began in}} 1573 by <b>Cardinal</b> <b>Mark</b> Sittich von Hohenems Altemps, who {{commissioned}} {{the design for}} it and for the Palazzo Altemps in central Rome from Martino Longhi the Elder, {{on the site of}} the remains of a Roman villa of the consular family of the Quinctilii.|$|E
50|$|Each mark {{indicates}} {{the edge of}} the safe water channel in terms of port (left-hand) or starboard (right-hand). These directions are relative to the direction of buoyage; this is usually a nominally upstream direction. In a river, the direction of buoyage is towards the river's source; in a harbour, the direction of buoyage is into the harbour from the sea. Where there may be doubt, it will be labelled on the appropriate chart. Often the <b>cardinal</b> <b>mark</b> system is used instead, when confusion about the direction would be common.|$|E

50|$|After {{the death}} of Ulrich III Sonnenberger, the Archduchy of Austria and the Archdiocese of Salzburg again had an {{argument}} over who was entitled to appoint a new Bishop of Gurk. Archbishop Bernhard von Rohr appointed Sixtus and this appointment was confirmed by the pope in 1470. Emperor Frederick III would have preferred the appointment of Lawrence of Freiberg, who was Provost of Gurk at the time. Both candidates were summoned, under threat of excommunication, to come to Augsburg, where the dispute was settled by <b>Cardinal</b> <b>Mark,</b> who was Patriarch of Aquileia and Papal Nuncio to Germany.|$|E
5000|$|She met the Archbishop at a festivity, whereafter Raitenau {{took her}} to his Salzburg residence. While her parents forbade her to ever enter their home again, she was {{installed}} officially as the archbishop's common law spouse. The couple's first known child was born in 1593; in total, the partnership produced fifteen sons and daughters. Raitenau, mediated by his uncle <b>Cardinal</b> <b>Mark</b> Sittich von Hohenems Altemps, worked incessantly but ultimatively in vain to obtain a papal dispensation to marry her. At least, upon a visit by Emperor Rudolf II in 1609, their children were officially relieved from their status as illegitimate.|$|E
50|$|When the Soderini family fell on hard times, he in turn sold it in 1568 to the Austrian-born <b>cardinal</b> <b>Mark</b> Sittich von Hohenems Altemps, {{the son of}} {{the sister}} of Pope Pius IV. Cardinal Altemps {{commissioned}} the architect Martino Longhi to expand and improve the palazzo; it was Longhi who built the belvedere. Cardinal Altemps accumulated a large collection of books and ancient sculpture. Though his position as the second son in his family meant Marco Sittico Altemps became a cleric, he was not inclined to priesthood. His mistress bore him a son, Roberto, made Duke of Gallese. Roberto Altemps was executed for adultery in 1586 by Pope Sixtus V.|$|E

50|$|Mutually {{inconsistent}} buoyage systems had proliferated in the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, leading to many accidents at sea. As {{chairman of the}} IALA Buoyage Committee, Bury oversaw the introduction in the 1970s of a standardised maritime buoyage systems, involving <b>cardinal</b> <b>marks</b> painted yellow and black with topmarks and lights to indicate to mariners the direction of maritime dangers, and lateral marks painted red or green to indicate whether the mark was to be passed on the port or starboard. The new standardised system was ratified in 1980, and the buoyage system remains in international use.|$|R

50|$|In August 1443, Somerset led 7,000 men to Cherbourg {{and marched}} south to Gascony; the duke was ill. He blundered into Guerche, a Breton town with which England {{had signed a}} peace treaty. But Somerset set all prisoners free, {{accepting}} money from the Duke of Brittany. Marching aimlessly through Maine, he returned that winter to England. His death in 1444 may have been suicide. His death, {{and that of his}} uncle the <b>cardinal,</b> <b>marked</b> the end of Beaufort influence, and left the door open for William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk, to dominate government. But the lasting effect of these events was burning resentment between the House of York and the remaining members of the Beaufort family.|$|R
