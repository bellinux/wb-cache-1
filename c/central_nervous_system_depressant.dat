5|$|Throughout history {{mandrake}}s (Mandragora officinarum) {{have been}} highly sought after for their reputed aphrodisiac properties. However, {{the roots of}} the mandrake plant also contain large quantities of the alkaloid scopolamine, which, at high doses, acts as a <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> <b>depressant,</b> and makes the plant highly toxic to herbivores. Scopolamine was later found to be medicinally used for pain management prior to and during labor; in smaller doses it is used to prevent motion sickness. One of the most well-known medicinally valuable terpenes is an anticancer drug, taxol, isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia, in the early 1960s.|$|E

25|$|The International Agency for Research on Cancer has {{classified}} tetrachloroethylene as a Group 2A carcinogen, {{which means}} {{that it is probably}} carcinogenic to humans. Like many chlorinated hydrocarbons, tetrachloroethylene is a <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> <b>depressant</b> and can enter the body through respiratory or dermal exposure. Tetrachloroethylene dissolves fats from the skin, potentially resulting in skin irritation.|$|E
25|$|Most reviews {{conclude}} that opioids produce minimal impairment of human performance on tests of sensory, motor, or attentional abilities. However, {{recent studies have}} been able to show some impairments caused by morphine, which is not surprising, given that morphine is a <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> <b>depressant.</b> Morphine has resulted in impaired functioning on critical flicker frequency (a measure of overall CNS arousal) and impaired performance on the Maddox wing test (a measure of deviation of the visual axes of the eyes). Few studies have investigated the effects of morphine on motor abilities; a high dose of morphine can impair finger tapping and the ability to maintain a low constant level of isometric force (i.e. fine motor control is impaired), though no studies have shown a correlation between morphine and gross motor abilities.|$|E
25|$|GHB is a <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> <b>depressant</b> {{used as an}} intoxicant, {{although}} it produces a stimulant effect at lower doses due to its action on the GHB receptor. It has many street names, including G, Liquid G, Liquid X, Liquid E, Georgia Home Boy, Juice, Mils, and Fantasy. Its effects have been described anecdotally as comparable with ethanol (alcohol) and MDMA use, such as euphoria, disinhibition, enhanced libido and empathogenic states. At higher doses, GHB may induce nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, agitation, visual disturbances, depressed breathing, amnesia, unconsciousness, and death. When death is associated with GHB, it is sometimes {{in conjunction with other}} drugs, such as alcohol or benzodiazepine which influence the same neurotransmitter (gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA). The effects of GHB can last from 1.5 to 4 hours, or even longer if large doses have been consumed. Consuming GHB with alcohol is dangerous as it can lead to respiratory arrest and vomiting in combination with unrouseable sleep, a potentially lethal combination.|$|E

25|$|Overexposure to {{ethyl acetate}} may cause {{irritation}} of the eyes, nose, and throat. Severe overexposure may cause weakness, drowsiness, and unconsciousness. Humans {{exposed to a}} concentration of 400ppm in 1.4mg/L ethyl acetate {{for a short time}} were affected by nose and throat irritation. Ethyl acetate is an irritant of the conjunctiva and mucous membrane of the respiratory tract. Animal experiments have shown that, at very high concentrations, the ester has <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> <b>depressant</b> and lethal effects; at concentrations of 20,000 to 43,000ppm (2.0â€“4.3%), there may be pulmonary edema with hemorrhages, symptoms of central nervous system depression, secondary anemia and liver damage. In humans, concentrations of 400ppm cause irritation of the nose and pharynx; cases have also been known of irritation of the conjunctiva with temporary opacity of the cornea. In rare cases exposure may cause sensitization of the mucous membrane and eruptions of the skin. The irritant effect of ethyl acetate is weaker than that of propyl acetate or butyl acetate.|$|E
500|$|The ECMDDA {{reported}} mephedrone {{can cause}} various unintended side effects including: dilated pupils, poor concentration, teeth grinding, problems focusing visually, poor short-term memory, hallucinations, delusions, and erratic behaviour. [...] They noted {{the most severe}} effects appear anecdotally to be linked with high doses or prolonged use, and the effects {{may be due to}} users taking other intoxicants at the same time. Other effects users in internet forums have noted include changes in body temperature, increased heart rate, breathing difficulties, loss of appetite, increased sweating, discolouration of extremities, anxiety, paranoia and depression. [...] When snorted, it can also cause nose bleeds and nose burns. A survey conducted by the National Addiction Centre, UK, found 67% of mephedrone users experienced sweating, 51% suffered from headaches, 43% from heart palpitations, 27% from nausea and 15% from cold or blue fingers, indicative of vasoconstriction occurring. Doctors at Guy's Hospital, London reported that, of 15 patients they treated after taking mephedrone in 2009, 53% were agitated, 40% had increased heart rates, 20% had systolic hypertension and 20% had seizures; three required treatment with benzodiazepines, predominantly to control their agitation. They reported none of their patients suffered from cold or blue peripheries, contrary to other reports. Nine of the 15 of patients had a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 15, indicating they were in a normal mental state, four had a GCS below 8, but these patients all reported using a <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> <b>depressant,</b> most commonly GHB, with mephedrone.

2500|$|Addiction, {{or what is}} {{sometimes}} referred to as psychological dependence, includes people misusing or craving the drug not to relieve withdrawal symptoms, but to experience its euphoric or intoxicating effects. It is important to distinguish between addiction and drug abuse of benzodiazepines and normal physical dependence on benzodiazepines. The increased GABAA inhibition caused by benzodiazepines is counteracted by the body's development of tolerance to the drug's effects; the development of tolerance occurs as a result of neuroadaptations, which result in decreased GABA inhibition and increased excitability of the glutamate system; these adaptations occur {{as a result of the}} body trying to overcome the <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> <b>depressant</b> effects of the drug to restore homeostasis. When benzodiazepines are stopped, these neuroadaptations are [...] "unmasked" [...] leading to hyper-excitability of the nervous system and the appearance of withdrawal symptoms.|$|E
