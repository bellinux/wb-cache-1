50|$|Only the A and B isomers {{have been}} found in nature. The first conduritol was {{isolated}} in 1908 by K. Kübler from the bark of the vine Marsdenia <b>condurango,</b> hence its name. A number of conduritol derivatives has antifeedant, antibiotic, antileukemic, andgrowth-regulating activity. Also some conduritol derivatives show interesting biological properties including tumour-inhibitory, antileukaemic, and antibiotic activities.|$|E
50|$|A 52-year-old {{man with}} an epigastric tumor {{presented}} to Despeignes. The tumor was {{about the size of}} the head of an eight-month-old fetus. Despeignes believed that cancer was caused by parasites, and that perhaps he could kill the parasite with radiation. On 4 July 1896 he commenced the X-ray treatments. Two half-hour treatments were given each day. Other treatments given to the patient were opium for pain relief, morphine and chloroform. A diet of <b>condurango</b> and milk was prescribed, with injections of artificial serum. The patient experienced pain relief, but died on 24 July. The cancer had shrunk by about 50%. Despeignes' equipment consisted of a Crookes' tube and six Radiguet battery elements.|$|E
5000|$|Pepper (1945, p. 411): [...] "There {{may be a}} {{time when}} during the {{carrying}} out of diagnostic tests it is undesirable to give potent medicine lest it interfere with the tests and yet the patient must be encouraged by treatment.... There {{is a certain amount of}} skill in the choice and administration of a placebo. In the first place, it must be nothing more than what the name implies a medicine without any pharmacologic action whatever. Even a mild sedative is not a true placebo. Secondly, its name must be unknown to even the most inveterate patient who knows most drugs by name and is always quick to read the prescription. If the medicines named are familiar, the type of patient who needs a placebo will promptly exclaim that this or that drug had been tried and 'had not helped me' or 'had upset my stomach'. It is well if the drug have a Latin and polysyllabic name; it is wise if it be prescribed with some assurance and emphasis for psychotherapeutic effect. The older physicians each had his favorite placeboic prescriptions - one chose Tincture of <b>Condurango,</b> another the Fluidextract sic of Cimicifuga nigra. Certainly this latter by its Latin name might be expected to have more supratentorial action than if one merely wrote for the Black Cohosh, and <b>Condurango</b> would be more effectual than sugar of milk." [...] Pepper's assertion that a placebo [...] "must be nothing more than what the name implies" [...] - namely that it must be [...] "a medicine without any pharmacologic action whatever" [...] - in order for it to be called a placebo, is most significant.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Whether the ultra-highly-diluted {{remedies}} used in homeopathy {{can effectively}} bring about modulations of gene expressions through acetylation/deacetylation of histones {{has not been}} explored. Therefore, in this study, we pointedly checked if the homeopathically-diluted anti-cancer remedy <b>Condurango</b> 30 C (ethanolic extract of Gonolobus <b>condurango</b> diluted 10 - 60 times) was capable of arresting the cell cycles in cervical cancer cells HeLa by triggering an epigenetic modification through modulation of {{the activity of the}} key enzyme histone deacetylase 2 vis-a-vis the succussed alcohol (placebo) control. Methods: We checked the activity of different signal proteins (like p 21 WAF, p 53, Akt, STAT 3) related to deacetylation, cell growth and differentiation by western blotting and analyzed cell-cycle arrest, if any, by fluorescence activated cell sorting. After viability assays had been performed with <b>Condurango</b> 30 C and with a placebo, the activities of histone de-acetylase (HDAC) enzymes 1 and 2 were measured colorimetrically. Results: While <b>Condurango</b> 30 C induced cytotoxicity in HeLa cells in vitro and reduced HDAC 2 activity quite strikingly, it apparently did not alter the HDAC 1 enzyme; the placebo had no or negligible cytotoxicity against HeLa cells and could not alter either the HDAC 1 or 2 activity. Data on p 21 WAF, p 53, Akt, and STAT 3 activities and a cell-cycle analysis revealed a reduction in DNA synthesis and G 1 -phase cell-cycle arrest when <b>Condurango</b> 30 C was used at a 2...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The present {{investigation}} aimed at examining if post-cancer treatment with a potentized homeopathic drug, <b>Condurango</b> 30 C, {{which is generally}} used to treat oesophageal cancer, could also show an ameliorating effect through apoptosis induction on lung cancer induced by benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) in white rats (Rattus norvegicus). Methods: Lung cancer was induced after four months by chronic feeding of BaP to rats through gavage at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight for one month. After four months, the lung-cancer-bearing rats were treated with <b>Condurango</b> 30 C {{for the next one}} (5 th), two (5 th- 6 th) and three (5 th- 7 th) months, respectively, and were sacrificed at the corresponding time- points. The ameliorating effect, if any, after <b>Condurango</b> 30 C treatment for the various periods was evaluated by using protocols such as histology, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), annexinV-FITC/PI assay, flow cytometry of the apoptosis marker, DNA fragmentation, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, and western blot analyses of lung tissue samples. Results: Striking recovery of lung tissue to a near normal status was noticed after post-cancerous drug treatment, as evidenced by SEM and histology, especially after one and two months of drug treatment. Data from the annexinV-FITC/PI and DNA fragmentation assays revealed that <b>Condurango</b> 30 C could induce apoptosis in cancer cells after post-cancer treatment. A critical analysis of signalling cascade, evidenced through a RT-PCR study, demonstrated up-regulation and down-regulation of different pro- and anti-apoptotic genes, respectively, related to a caspase- 3 -mediated apoptotic pathway, which was especially discernible after one-month and two- month drug treatments. Correspondingly, Western blot and immunohistochemistry studies confirmed the ameliorative potential of <b>Condurango</b> 30 C by its ability to down-regulate the elevated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression, a hallmark of lung cancer. Conclusion: The overall result validated a positive effect of <b>Condurango</b> 30 C in ameliorating lung cancer through caspase- 3 -mediated apoptosis induction and EGFR down-regulation. ...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: <b>Condurango</b> (Gonolobus <b>condurango)</b> extract {{is used by}} {{complementary}} {{and alternative}} medicine (CAM) practitioners as a traditional medicine, including homeopathy, mainly {{for the treatment of}} syphilis. <b>Condurango</b> bark extract is also known to reduce tumor volume, but the underlying molecular mechanisms still remain unclear. Methods: Using a cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) as our model, the molecular events behind <b>condurango</b> extract’s (CE’s) anticancer effect were investigated by using flow cytometry, immunoblotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Other included cell types were prostate cancer cells (PC 3), transformed liver cells (WRL- 68), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results: <b>Condurango</b> extract (CE) was found to be cytotoxic against target cells, and this was significantly deactivated in the presence of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting that its action could be mediated through ROS generation. CE caused an increase in the HeLa cell population containing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage at the G zero/Growth 1 (G 0 /G 1) stage. Further, CE increased the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and the fas receptor (FasR) levels both at the ribonucleic acid (RNA) and the protein levels, indicating that CE might have a cytotoxic mechanism of action. CE also triggered a sharp decrease in the expression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) both at the RNA and the protein levels, a possible route to attenuation of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl- 2), and caused an opening of the mitochondrial membrane’s permeability transition (MPT) pores, thus enhancing caspase activities. Conclusion: Overall, our results suggest possible pathways for CE mediated cytotoxicity in model cancer cells...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: In homeopathy, it {{is claimed}} that more homeopathically-diluted potencies render more protective/curative effects against any disease condition. Potentized forms of <b>Condurango</b> are used {{successfully}} to treat digestive problems, {{as well as}} esophageal and stomach cancers. However, the comparative efficacies of <b>Condurango</b> 6 C and 30 C, one diluted below and one above Avogadro’s limit (lacking original drug molecule), respectively, have not been critically analyzed for their cell-killing (apoptosis) efficacy against lung cancer cells in vitro, and signalling cascades have not been studied. Hence, {{the present study was}} undertaken. Methods: 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenylte- trazolium bromide (MTT) assays were conducted on H 460 -non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells by using a succussed ethyl alcohol vehicle (placebo) as a control. Studies on cellular morphology, cell cycle regulation, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and DNA-damage were made, and expressions of related signaling markers were studied. The observations were done in a “blinded” manner. Results: Both <b>Condurango</b> 6 C and 30 C induced apoptosis via cell cycle arrest at subG 0 /G 1 and altered expressions of certain apoptotic markers significantly in H 460 cells. The drugs induced oxidative stress through ROS elevation and MMP depolarization at 18 - 24 hours. These events presumably activated a caspase- 3 -mediated signalling cascade, as evidenced by reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blot and immunofluorescence studies at a late phase (48 hours) in which cells were pushed towards apoptosis. Conclusion: <b>Condurango</b> 30 C had greater apoptotic effect than <b>Condurango</b> 6 C as claimed in the homeopathic doctrine. ...|$|E
40|$|Objectives:Condurango {{is widely}} used in various systems of {{complementary}} and alternative medicines (CAM) against oesophageal and stomach ailments including certain types of cancer. However, until now no systematic study has been conducted to verify its efficacy and dose with proper experimental support. Therefore, we examined if ethanolic extract of <b>Condurango</b> could ameliorate benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) -induced lung cancer in rats, in vivo to validate its use as traditional medicine. Methods:Fifteen male and 15 female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were treated with 0. 28 mg/kg of Sweet Bee Venom (SBV) (high-dosage group) and the same numbers {{of male and female}} SD rats were treated with 0. 2 mL/kg of normal saline (control group) for 13 weeks. We selected five male and five female SD rats from the high-dosage group and the same numbers of male and female SD rats from the control group, and we observed these rats for four weeks. We conducted body-weight measurements, ophthalmic examinations, urinalyses and hematology, biochemistry, histology tests. Results:A histological study revealed gradual progress in lung tissue-repair activity in Condurango-fed cancer-bearing rats, showing gradual tissue recovery after three months of drug administration. <b>Condurango</b> has the capacity to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which may contribute to a reduction in anti-oxidative activity and to an induction of oxidative stress-mediated cancer cell-death. Condurango-activated pro-apoptotic genes (Bax, caspase- 3, caspase- 9, p 53, cytochrome-c, apaf- 1, ICAD and PARP) and down-regulated antiapoptotic-Bcl- 2 expression were noted both at mRNA and protein levels. Studies on caspase- 3 activation and PARP cleavage by western blot analysis revealed that <b>Condurango</b> induced apoptosis through a caspase- 3 -dependent pathway. Conclusion:The anticancer efficacy of an ethanolic extract of <b>Condurango</b> for treating BaP-induced lung cancer in rats lends support for its use in various traditional systems of medicine...|$|E
40|$|Background: Marsdenia <b>condurango</b> (<b>condurango)</b> is a {{tropical}} woody vine native to South America. Our earlier study {{was limited to}} evaluation of anti-cancer potentials of crude <b>condurango</b> extract and its glycoside-rich components in vitro on lung cancer. Objective: This study aims at evaluating the effect of the single isolated active ingredient condurangogenin A (ConA; C 32 H 42 O 7) on A 549, H 522 and H 460 -nonsmall-cell lung cancer cells. Materials and Methods: ConA was isolated by column chromatography and analyzed by mass spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and proton-nuclear magnetic resonance. diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays were conducted on three cell-types using 6 %-alcohol as control. Critical studies on cellular morphology, cell-cycle regulation, reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential, and DNA-damage were made, and expressions of related signaling markers studied. Results: As IC 50 doses of ConA proved to be too high and toxic to both A 549 and H 522 cells, all experimental studies were carried out on H 460 cells with the IC 50 dose (32 μg/ml − 24 h). Cellular morphology revealed typical apoptotic features after ConA treatment. At early treatment hours (2 h- 12 h), maximum cells were arrested at G 0 /G 1 phase that could be correlated with reduced level of cyclin D 1 -CDK with p 21 up-regulation. At 18 h − 24 h, sub G 0 /G 1 cell population was increased gradually, as revealed from cytochrome-c release and caspase- 3 activation, further confirming the apoptosis-inducing ability of ConA at later phases. Gradual increase of TUNEL-positive cells with significant modulation of mitochondria-dependent apoptotic markers at longer time-points would establish apoptosis-induction property of ConA, indicating its potential as a strong candidate for anti-cancer drug formulation. Conclusion: Further studies are warranted against other types of cancer cells and animal models before its possible human use...|$|E
