50|$|The Delmarva Chicken Festival is {{an annual}} event {{sponsored}} by Delmarva Poultry Industry, Inc started in 1948 {{with the purpose of}} publicizing the Delmarva Peninsula with an emphasis on its arguably most important agricultural enterprise, raising chickens. The two-day event hosted in various locales on Delmarva features trade shows, arts and crafts, carnival, entertainment, and food concessions. Chicken is, of course, the featured food, but french fries, corn-on-the-cob, funnel <b>cake,</b> <b>ice</b> cream, kettle corn, and fresh-squeezed lemonade are other local favorites. Nearly three tons of chicken are cooked each year in the world's largest frying pan. The pan made its debut at the second annual festival in 1950. The first and original pan was used and made by the Mumford Sheet Metal Company in Selbyville, Delaware. It was ten feet in diameter and had an eight-foot handle, weighed 650 pounds and could hold 800 chicken quarters. The 60th Annual Delmarva Chicken Festival took place June 19 and 20, 2009 in Centreville, Maryland, United States.|$|E

5000|$|The game {{begins with}} Princess Bubblegum entreating the player (as {{one of the}} various playable characters) to {{investigate}} the large and secret Royal Dungeon that lies below the Land of Ooo. Several prisoners have been escaping, but as the prison {{is supposed to be}} impossible to escape, Bubblegum is stumped as to how the prisoners are escaping and entreats the player to explore the dungeon because [...] "I don't know". As the game progresses several characters are unlocked and become playable characters through various situations. It is briefly suspected that Ice King is releasing the prisoners, but he is shown to have only been in the dungeon to create large Fiona and <b>Cake</b> <b>ice</b> statues. The game eventually leads up to a battle between the player(s) and a giant pink blob that is revealed to be Princess Bubblegum's parents. About a thousand years ago she was gestated within the blob and was later expelled from its mass. Bubblegum explains that she grew up to become more independent and became a princess. She kept the blob in the Royal Dungeon, but over time the mass expanded and inadvertently released the prisoners. This causes the Ice King to angrily demand to know how old Bubblegum is and she replies that she is 827 years old, which horrifies him. Finn questions Bubblegum's rationale for covering up the secret of her parents, only for Marceline to defend Bubblegum by saying that the others {{would have done the same}} for their parents. However, as a result of the player's fight against the blob, it is unable to reform and turns into a set of bubbles, one of which kisses Bubblegum on the cheek.|$|E

40|$|Antarctic Sea Ice Processes and Climate (ASPeCt) visual ship-based {{observations}} {{were conducted in}} the Bellingshausen Sea during the Sea Ice Mass Balance in the Antarctic (SIMBA) cruise in austral spring 2007. A total of 59 ASPeCt observations are compared to coincident satellite active and passive microwave data. Envisat and RADARSAT- 1 C-Band HH-polarization radar backscatter values (called NRCS henceforth) are derived on km-scales for six individual ice types and ice type mixtures. C-Band HH-polarized and Ku-Band VV-polarized NRCS are extracted on several 10 km-scale areas from coincident Envisat, RADARSAT- 1, and QuikSCAT radar images for areas primarily covered with multiyear, deformed first-year, and undeformed young ice, as well as ice of the marginal ice zone (MIZ). The C-Band NRCS permits distinction between first-year, MIZ, and undeformed young ice. However, NRCS of the multiyear ice zone overlaps {{with that of the}} other ice zones and types. Ku-Band NRCS obtained for the same ice types permits discrimination of the first-year ice zone only. Obtained NRCS agree with those of previous studies and suggest a high degree of deformation and considerable potential for flooding for the first-year ice case. In comparison to large scale NRCS, AMSR-E snow depth values form two clearly separated clusters, one for 0. 24 – 0. 35 m depth (first-year ice zone) and one for 0. 36 – 0. 54 m depth (multiyear ice zone). However, a comparison to ASPeCt observations suggests a remarkable underestimation of the snow depth by AMSR-E in the multiyear–first-year-ice transition zone and for first-year <b>cake</b> <b>ice.</b> Nevertheless, a fusion of the coarse AMSR-E snow depth ranges for interior pack ice regions with radar imagery at large scale, appears promising for mapping the major zones (MIZ and Pack Ice) and ice types (first-year and multiyear) of Antarctic sea ice on a circumpolar basis...|$|E

40|$|Time for dessert. Nobody {{can have}} {{anything}} unless Mom has explicitly {{given her the}} option to. And nobody goes against Mom. Those are the rules {{and this is how}} the game is played: (1) a. Dad, to Mom: “For dessert, we have <b>cake,</b> <b>ice</b> cream, and crème caramel. ” b. Mom, to Leonor: “You may have crème caramel. ” c. Mom, to Sandy: “You may have either this piece of cake or that ice cream. ” What has Leonor learned about her permitted dessert options? That she has one: having crème caramel. Were she to have cake, she would be disobedient — given the rules of the game, if Mom had wanted her to have cake, she would have surely said so. What has Sandy learned about her dessert options? At least three things: (i) that having cake and ice cream is out of question — what l will call the exclusivity requirement — (ii) that having crème caramel is not a permitted option (if Mom had wanted her to have crème caramel, she would have said so) — what I will call the exhaustivity requirement — and (iii) that she has two dessert options and each is permitted — the distribution requirement (a term borrowed from Kratzer and Shimoyama (2002)). For the most part, only the distribution requirement will concern us here. The problem is an old one: the standard semantics of modals and or does not de-liver the distribution requirement (von Wright, 1968; Kamp, 1973). To see why, take the sentence in (1 c). I assume that may is a raising predicate, that its surface structure subject is not its own argument and reconstructs back under its scope at LF, as in (2 a). The textbook semantics of deontic may requires that the proposition expressed by its sister constituent be compatible with the set of permitted worlds. ∗Many people deserve to be thanked for many insightful observations.
