5|$|In Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties, {{the three}} new civilizations must build a Wonder to advance from age to age, instead of {{advancing}} from the Town Center. Unlike previous Age of Empires games, the player does not achieve victory {{by building a}} wonder. Players <b>can</b> <b>choose</b> <b>from</b> a selection of wonders, each having benefits unique to their civilization. Once built, this wonder provides an initial bonus of units or resources, while continuing to provide a benefit to the player's civilization. This initial bonus becomes larger, depending on which age is being advanced to. Since the wonder is a building, players can assign different numbers of villagers to build it, which affects the speed of advancement. Wonders that are destroyed cannot be rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|The game {{does not}} have a {{competitive}} multiplayer mode, but it has a cooperative multiplayer mode that pits four players together to complete a nine-mission campaign based on the campaign of the original Syndicate games. Players face enemies that become increasingly difficult to deal with as the game progresses. They <b>can</b> <b>choose</b> <b>from</b> four character classes: Medic, Spec Ops, Assault and Generic, each with different abilities. The breaching mechanic is also present in the mode for defensive and offensive purposes. For instance, they can hack into a turret to disable its armor or heal team-mates using this mechanic. Players receive points as they progress through the game's levels; these points can be used to research new weapons.|$|E
5|$|The versus mode {{is a free}} {{fighting}} mode where multiple {{players can}} box. The number of players can range from 0–2; both fighters can be controlled by either the computer or by a player. Initially {{there are only two}} playable characters; additional characters become accessible by playing through the story mode. Although the characters are grouped by their boxing weight class, any character can be selected to fight another regardless of weight class. Players <b>can</b> <b>choose</b> <b>from</b> ten locations for the bout. Initially, the only available arena is the Kamogawa Boxing Gym basement. New locations become available once a fight occurs there in the story mode.|$|E

5|$|Following its predecessors, Brawl uses {{a battle}} system {{unlike that of}} typical {{fighting}} games. Players <b>can</b> <b>choose</b> <b>from</b> a large selection of characters, each attempting to knock their opponents off the screen as they fight on various stages. The characters in Brawl include most of the same ones as the predecessors, such as the well-known Mario and Pikachu. Instead of using traditional health bars that start at a maximum value and lose value, Brawl characters start the game with 0%; the value rises as they take damage and may rise over 100% {{to a maximum of}} 999%. As a character's percentage increases, the character flies further back when hit. When a character is knocked beyond a stage's boundary and disappears from the screen, the character loses either a life, a point, or coins, depending on the mode of play. Brawl includes a function which allows players to create profiles with personalized button configurations for each control method along with their chosen username.|$|E
5|$|Gunfights {{are a major}} {{gameplay}} mechanic in Red Dead Redemption. The {{player can}} take cover, target a specific person or animal, blindfire, and free aim. Individual body parts can also be targeted, {{in order to take}} targets down non-lethally. When the player shoots an enemy, the game engine uniquely creates the AI reactions and movements depending on where they were hit. The player character <b>can</b> <b>choose</b> <b>from</b> period-accurate weapons including revolvers, pistols, lever or bolt-action rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, knives, explosives, lassos, mounted Gatling guns, and cannons. Duels utilize a gunslinger gameplay mechanic known as Dead Eye. Dead Eye is a targeting system that is used in a bullet time-like manner, allowing the player to slow down time to place a precise shot or paint in multiple shots. When the targeting sequence ends, Marston automatically fires to all marked locations in extremely quick succession.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the game, the player {{controls}} one of a select few characters directly based upon their counterparts in the Naruto anime and manga. Clash of Ninja {{is a member of the}} fighting game genre; the player pits their character against another character controlled by the game's AI or by another player, depending on the mode that the player is in. The objective is to reduce the opponent's health to zero using basic attacks and special techniques unique to each character that are derived from techniques they use in the Naruto anime or manga. For instance, Naruto Uzumaki is able to use his signature Shadow Clone Technique, and Rock Lee utilizes many of his Strong Fist style techniques. To use these techniques, characters have available a chakra bar, which depletes upon the execution of a special technique, and regenerates over time. In the game's numerous modes, the player <b>can</b> <b>choose</b> <b>from</b> different styles of play. The game's story mode follows the plot from the anime and manga, and a versus mode pitting two players against each other also included.|$|E

Depending on the platform, players in online and offline modes (against bots) range from 4 to 16.
