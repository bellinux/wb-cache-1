5|$|Recent {{research}} {{has revealed that}} the size distributions of the hot classical and cold classical objects have differing slopes. The slope for the hot objects is q = 5.3 at large diameters and q = 2.0 at small diameters with the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>slope</b> at 110 km. The slope for the cold objects is q = 8.2 at large diameters and q = 2.9 at small diameters with a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>slope</b> at 140 km. The size distributions of the scattering objects, the plutinos, and the Neptune trojans have slopes similar to the other dynamically hot populations, but may instead have a divot, a sharp {{decrease in the number}} of objects below a specific size. This divot is hypothesized to be due to either the collisional evolution of the population, or to be due to the population having formed with no objects below this size, with the smaller objects being fragments of the original objects.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{resulting}} properties of memristors and memristive systems is {{the existence of a}} pinched hysteresis effect. For a current-controlled memristive system, the input u(t) is the current i(t), the output y(t) is the voltage v(t), and the slope of the curve represents the electrical resistance. The <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>slope</b> of the pinched hysteresis curves demonstrates switching between different resistance states which is a phenomenon central to ReRAM and other forms of two-terminal resistance memory. At high frequencies, memristive theory predicts the pinched hysteresis effect will degenerate, resulting in a straight line representative of a linear resistor. It has been proven that some types of non-crossing pinched hysteresis curves (denoted Type-II) cannot be described by memristors.|$|E
2500|$|The incline {{from floor}} 5 to floor 9 was [...] long, with a {{gradient}} of 1 in 1.97 {{at the top}} and 1 in 2.15 at the bottom. It follows the roof of the vein, and the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>slope</b> is caused by the dip of the vein changing. A cradle running on standard gauge tracks run up and down the incline. It was counterbalanced by a weighted truck running on [...] gauge tracks, running down the centre of the incline. The counterbalance passed under the main cradle, which carried trucks on three transverse tracks, at the midway point. At the bottom of the incline, the cradle descended into a pit, to that its top was level with the floor, to enable the loaded trucks to be off-loaded easily. Sometime after the construction of this incline, a similar one was built between floors 3 and 6 {{in the western part of}} the mine. It sloped down at 1 in 1.26, and was [...] long. From about 1890, the mine began to be extended below level 9, for which a new incline was needed. It ran from near the foot of the 5/9 incline, and descended at a gradient of 1 in 2.48 for a distance of about [...] to reach floor 14. It was probably powered by a counterbalance system, since another incline was constructed from the head of the 9/14 incline up to floor 6. It was too small for it to have housed a transporter truck, but could easily have been used by a balancing truck, which would have been filled with water at floor 6 to make it heavy enough to raise the transporter on the 9/14 incline, and emptied for movement in the reverse direction. No details of it have survived, and power was provided by two Pelton wheels on floor 9 from 1899, which were supplied with water from the abandoned adit on floor 4.|$|E
40|$|Whilst {{there are}} many {{approaches}} to detecting <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> mean for a univariate time-series, the problem of detecting multiple <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>slope</b> has comparatively been ignored. Part {{of the reason for}} this is that detecting <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>slope</b> is much more challenging. For example, simple binary segmentation procedures do not work for this problem, whilst efficient dynamic programming methods that work well for the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> mean problem cannot be directly used for detecting <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>slope.</b> We present a novel dynamic programming approach, CPOP, for finding the "best" continuous piecewise-linear fit to data. We define best based on a criterion that measures fit to data using the residual sum of squares, but penalises complexity based on an $L_ 0 $ penalty on <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>slope.</b> We show that using such a criterion is more reliable at estimating changepoint locations than approaches that penalise complexity using an $L_ 1 $ penalty. Empirically CPOP has good computational properties, and can analyse a time-series with over 10, 000 observations and over 100 <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> a few minutes. Our method is used to analyse data on the motion of bacteria, and provides fits to the data that both have substantially smaller residual sum of squares and are more parsimonious than two competing approaches...|$|R

This fact, together with other evidence, suggests that the liquidus profile of an igneous rock series may be characterized by three shelves (where small temperature changes cause much fusion or crystallization, and large compositional changes) separated by steep slopes (where large temperature changes cause little crystallization or fusion, and small compositional changes). The shelves extend across picritic compositions (upper), basic and intermediate compositions (middle), and acid compositions (lower).

An extensive dataset of shallow sediment cores is analyzed here, in order to investigate the influence of gradient changes on individual siliciclastic gravity flows passing through this system in the last 160, 000 years. The largest flows (deposit volumes > 100 km 3) are capable of travelling for more than 1000 km across slopes of less than 0. 1 °.

Increases in gradient can lead to sediment bypass and/or erosion, and unconfined flows may become channelized. Decreases in gradient can lead to significant <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> sand–mud ratio and the deposition of thick mud caps, while small-volume flow deposits may pinch out completely. One of the largest flows shows evidence for multiple transformations as it crossed the Agadir Basin, with the resulting deposits switching laterally from (1) a gravel lag and cut-and-fill scours (representing bypass and erosion across a slope of 0. 05 °), to (2) a thick linked turbidite–debrite bed containing a muddy sand debrite (in response to a decrease <b>in</b> <b>slope</b> to < 0. 01 °), to (3) a normally graded turbidite (following a subtle increase <b>in</b> <b>slope</b> to 0. 02 °).
