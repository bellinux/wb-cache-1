50|$|The {{lighting}} {{of thousands of}} beacons across the Commonwealth took place on 4 June. The number of beacons was originally set at 2,012; by the <b>closing</b> <b>date</b> <b>for</b> <b>registrations,</b> approximately 4,000 had been submitted in the United Kingdom alone. The first beacon of the Jubilee was lit {{on the grounds of}} Apifo'ou College in Nuku ªalofa, Tonga, by Tongan girl and Boy Scouts using coconut sheath torches. Other nations, including Kenya, Australia, New Zealand, India, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, and several Caribbean states, took part in the beacon lighting. The world's most remote beacon was lit in Tristan da Cunha in the south Atlantic, using invasive, non-native plants to fuel the fire. In the United Kingdom, British servicemen and women wounded in battle and individuals representing charities carried beacons to the summits of the UK's four highest peaks. One beacon was lit at Treetops Hotel in Aberdare National Park in Kenya, where the Queen was at the moment of her accession to the throne. The Queen lit the beacon outside Buckingham Palace at 10:30 pm, by inserting a large, specially made, diamond-cut crystal into a receptacle. The lighting proceeded until the final beacon was lit in Canada eight hours later.|$|R
40|$|Enrollment shifts, declining public expenditures, and {{retrenchment}} characterize {{higher education}} in the 1980 s. The prevailing atmosphere of attenuation has resulted in the excision of academic programs and units no longer central to institutional mission. Like other areas of higher education, home economics has become a subject of analysis in universities dealing with financial stress as evidenced by program reorganization and discontinuance. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify factors leading to the continuance of discontinuance of home economics programs or units. Specifically, significant indicators of enrollment and financial stress were identified as they relate to home economics programs that have continued or have been partially discontinued in public doctorate-granting universities. The results of the current study were derived from the analysis of responses from fifty-six (74 % return) home economics administrators in public doctorate-granting universities. The major conclusions drawn from the results include the following: (1) No empirical evidence was found to establish a relationship between accreditation status and the continuance or discontinuance of home economics programs in public doctorate-granting universities. (2) Ten statistically significant factors were identified which were characteristic of or related to home economics programs which have discontinued academic units. Eight factors supported previous contentions, including increased teaching loads; encouragement of unselective early retirement; reduced supplies, equipment and travel budgets; decreased diversity of student profiles; decreased rate of applications for admission; decreased rates of funding for additional students; decline in the flow of students from high school; and decline in the level of the socioeconomic status of the student population. (3) Findings regarding two factors contradicted previous contentions. Decreased federal funding was not characteristic of home economics programs that have experienced retrenchment to the extent of discontinuing academic units. Likewise, a shorter period between the <b>closing</b> <b>date</b> <b>for</b> applications and <b>registration</b> characterized continuing home economics programs, not retrenching programs as previously thought. Consideration of these significant factors could aid college and university administrators in strategically planning for the future of higher education, and of home economics in particular, to maintain institutional and programmatic quality and flexibility...|$|R
