50|$|Spinal cord {{stimulation}} (SCS) is {{an effective}} therapy {{for the treatment of}} chronic and intractable pain including diabetic neuropathy, failed back surgery syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome, phantom limb pain, ischemic limb pain, refractory unilateral limb pain syndrome, postherpetic neuralgia and acute herpes zoster pain. Another pain condition that is a potential candidate for SCS treatment is Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, which is associated with moderate to severe chronic extremity pain. SCS therapy consists of the electrical stimulation of the spinal cord to 'mask' pain. The gate theory proposed in 1965 by Melzack and Wall provided a theoretical construct to attempt SCS as a clinical treatment for chronic pain. This theory postulates that activation of large diameter, myelinated primary afferent fibers suppresses the response of dorsal horn neurons to input from small, unmyelinated primary afferents.A simple SCS system consists of three different parts. First, microelectrodes are implanted in the epidural space to deliver stimulation pulses to the tissue. Second, an electrical pulse generator implanted in the lower abdominal area or gluteal region while is connected to the electrodes via wires, and third a remote control to adjust the stimulus parameters such as pulse width and pulse rate in the PG. Improvements have been made in both the clinical aspects of SCS such as transition from subdural placement of contacts to epidural placement, which reduces the risk and morbidity of SCS implantation, and also technical aspects of SCS such as improving percutaneous leads, and fully implantable multi-channel stimulators. However, there are many parameters that need to be optimized including number of implanted contacts, <b>contact</b> <b>size</b> and spacing, and electrical sources for stimulation. The stimulus pulse width and pulse rate are important parameters that need to be adjusted in SCS, which are typically 400 us and 8-200 Hz respectively.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{explains}} the method to synchronize speed and distance for <b>contact</b> <b>size</b> measurement. The <b>contact</b> <b>size</b> {{was measured using}} ultrasound that strikes continuously onto the surface. Part of the ultrasound energy was transmitted and another part was reflected. As this happen, there is a reduction in pulse amplitude due to the fraction between the reflected energy and the transmitted one. A series of reflection pulses were obtained as the ultrasound pulses strikes. These amplitude pulses reduce when enters contact and eventually return to normal. If the speed and distance of a track were measured, then {{it is possible to}} measure the <b>contact</b> <b>size</b> as the contact passing. However, the speed and ultrasound pulsing rate must be synchronized so that the distance is proportionate to speed changes.

40|$|An {{indentation}} experiment involves five variables: indenter shape, {{material behavior}} of the substrate, <b>contact</b> <b>size,</b> applied load and indentation depth. Only three variable are known afterwards, namely, indenter shape, plus load and depth as function of time. As the <b>contact</b> <b>size</b> is not measured and {{the determination of the}} material properties is the very aim of the test; two equations are needed to obtain a mathematically solvable system. For elastic materials, the <b>contact</b> <b>size</b> can always be eliminated once and for all in favor of the depth; a single relation between load, depth and material properties remains with the latter variable as unknown. For viscoelastic materials where hereditary integrals model the constitutive behavior, the relation between depth and <b>contact</b> <b>size</b> usually depends also on the (time-dependent) properties of the material. Solving the inverse problem, i. e., determining the material properties from the experimental data, therefore needs both equations. Extending Sneddon's analysis of the indentation problem for elastic materials to include viscoelastic materials, the two equations mentioned above are derived. To find the time dependence of the material properties the feasibility of Golden and Graham's method of decomposing hereditary integrals (J. M. Golden and G. A. C. Graham. Boundary value problems in linear viscoelasticity, Springer, 1988) is investigated and applied to a single load-unload process and to sinusoidally driven stationary state indentation processes.

40|$|A {{physically}} based {{model for}} dishing during metal chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is presented. The control of dishing {{is important for}} advanced damascene metal interconnect technologies. However, the modeling of dishing is still in an initial phase. Material removal mainly {{takes place at the}} contact areas between the rough polish pad and the substrate. Therefore, a numerical model of the contact area of the pad and wafer, and the number of contacts and the size distribution of the contact areas as function of polish parameters and pad properties, was developed. The number of contacts appeared directly proportional to the applied pressure. In addition, the <b>contact</b> <b>size</b> distribution was strongly dependent on pad morphology. It was weakly dependent on the applied pressure and the Young's modulus of the pad. Thereafter the dishing phenomenon was modeled using these results. For an arbitrary linewidth, the metal was removed by two groups of pad asperities, one group with <b>contact</b> <b>size</b> smaller than the linewidth (group S) and one with <b>contact</b> <b>size</b> larger than the metal linewidth (group B). By considering the material removal rate of these two groups of asperities separately and using a modified form of Preston's law, a model was developed that describes the dishing during (over) polishing for an arbitrary metal line. The model contains one free parameter. The model was compared with experimental results obtained from state-of-the-art copper CMP. Excellent agreement was observed between data and the mode...|$|E

The crystals {{are assumed to be}} stiff, but not completely rigid. Commensurate and incommensurate configurations are identified systematically. It is shown that three distinct friction branches coexist, an incommensurate one that does not scale with the <b>contact</b> <b>size</b> ($A^ 0 $) and two commensurate ones which scale differently (with $A^{ 1 / 2 }$ and $A$) and are associated with various combinations of commensurate and incommensurate lattice parameters and orientations.

To demonstrate this, the procedure is repeated for rectangular geometry. The scaling of irregularly shaped crystals is also considered, and again three branches are found ($A^{ 1 / 4 }, A^{ 3 / 4 }, A$).

Unfortunately, the underlying mechanisms of this treatment are unclear {{and there are many}} uncertainties regarding the most effective stimulation parameters and electrode configuration. In this paper, we present a MCS model with a 3 D representation of several axonal populations. The model predicts that the activation of either the basket cell or pyramidal tract (PT) type axons is involved in the clinical effect of MCS. We propose stimulation protocols selectively targeting one of these two axon types. To selectively target the basket cell axons, our simulations suggest using either cathodal or bipolar stimulation with the electrode strip placed perpendicular rather than parallel to the gyrus. Furthermore, selectivity can be increased by using multiple cathodes. PT type axons can be selectively targeted with anodal stimulation using electrodes with large <b>contact</b> <b>sizes.</b> Placing the electrode epidurally is advisable over subdural placement. These selective protocols, when practically implemented, can be used to further test which axon type should be activated for clinically effective MCS and can subsequently be applied to optimize treatment.

We show {{that it is possible}} to design an optimal shape of the tip of the fiber to achieve the theoretical pull-off force. However, such design tends to be unreliable at the macroscopic scale because the pull-off force is sensitive to small variations in the tip shape. We find that a robust design of shape-insensitive optimal adhesion becomes possible only when the diameter of the fiber is reduced to length scales on the order of 100 nm. In general, optimal adhesion could be achieved by a combination of size reduction and shape optimization. The smaller the size, the less important the shape.
