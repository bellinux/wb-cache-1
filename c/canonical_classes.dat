To demonstrate the usefulness of our findings, we predicted cluster membership of CDR-L 3 sequences from three next-generation sequencing datasets of the antibody repertoire (over 1, 000, 000 sequences).

40|$|In [GT], Goldin and {{the second}} author extend some ideas from Schubert {{calculus}} to the more general setting of Hamiltonian torus actions on compact symplectic manifolds with isolated fixed points. (See also [Kn 99] and [Kn 08].) The main goal {{of this paper is}} to build on this work by finding more effective formulas. More explicitly, given a generic component of the moment map, they define a canonical class α_p in the equivariant cohomology of the manifold M for each fixed point p ∈ M. When they exist, <b>canonical</b> <b>classes</b> form a natural basis of the equivariant cohomology of M. In particular, when M is a flag variety, these classes are the equivariant Schubert classes. It is a long standing problem in combinatorics to find positive integral formulas for the equivariant structure constants associated to this basis. Since computing the restriction of the <b>canonical</b> <b>classes</b> to the fixed points determines these structure constants, it is important to find effective formulas for these restrictions. In this paper, we introduce new techniques for calculating the restrictions of a canonical class α_p to a fixed point q. Our formulas are nearly always simpler, in the sense that they count the contributions over fewer paths. Moreover, our formula is manifestly positive and integral in certain important special cases.
