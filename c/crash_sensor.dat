40|$|Seatbelt {{performance}} in rollovers {{has come under}} increased scrutiny in recent years. This is due, in part, to growing popularity of sport utility vehicles which have a demonstrated inferior rollover resistance when compared to passenger cars [1]. In the United States (U. S.) the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has stated an intent to mandate {{an increase in the}} roof strength safety standard. Such an improvement in roof strength will undoubtedly bring an increased focus on the performance of seatbelts in rollovers. Many contemporary seatbelt retractors are equipped with both a vehicle <b>crash</b> <b>sensor</b> as well as a secondary, or backup, webbing sensor. The webbing sensor is intended as a backup locking device {{in the event of a}} failure of the primary inertially sensitive vehicle sensor. The crash modes presenting the most potential for the inertial sensor’s failure include non-planar crashes, multiple impacts, and rollovers [2]. It follows, therefore, that to ensure reliable seatbelt retractor lockup in these modes, the redundant webbing sensor must be tuned with a lockup threshold consistent with expected occupant motions and webbing extraction rates seen during these events. Rollover tests conducted by NHTSA wherein the belt systems were instrumented for both load and webbing payout were analyzed. This analysis provides insight for determining a baseline lockup threshold for the webbing sensor required to ensure activation in the rollover crash mode. Additionally, multiple retractors designed for both European and U. S. markets have been tested on a bench-top sled. These tests were conducted to include out-of-plane accelerations similar to those observed in rollover crashes. The retractor sled test results, along with the analysis of the NHTSA rollover tests, are then discussed and used to develop a suggested webbing sensor lockup threshold necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the redundant and backup webbing <b>crash</b> <b>sensor</b> in real-world events...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the usage of}} MADYMO simulations in improving frontal <b>crash</b> <b>sensor</b> calibration. MADYMO simulations were conducted in the frontal impact program to improve the sensor calibration. In developing the advanced frontal impact restraint system using dual stage inflator, sensor calibration is very important. Late firing of the first stage inflator and large time delay between first and second stage time-to-fires increased occupant injuries. In the early version of sensor calibration, the initially given TTF’s were not satisfied in some test speed conditions due to late first stage TTF and large time delay. Therefore, {{in order to determine}} the correct required TTF’s, MADYMO simulations were used. First, the dual stage inflator was modeled as having two stages, which are primary and secondary stages. Then, MADYMO simulations were conducted by giving time delay between first and second stages of inflator model. Through simulations, the required TTF’s were determined, which produced the injury values meeting the customer targets, and it was found that the relatively large time delay could be used in the low speeds. With the new required TTF’s and the relatively large time delay in low speeds, sensor calibration was repeated. The recalibration was found to satisfy the required TTF’s from the MADYMO simulations. A sled test was conducted in the worst-case condition and the injury results met the regulation limits...|$|E

30|$|Intelligent {{transportation}} systems have received increasing attention from academia, industry, and governments, {{and have been}} considered the next technological change in individuals’ daily lives [47]. Automobile manufacturers, {{in an attempt to}} overcome the aforementioned ITS limitations, have developed products that help drivers, called Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). These systems [48, 49] obtain vehicle data from sensors or embedded devices (e.g., cameras and stability control sensors) for the prevention and detection of collisions (e.g., <b>crash</b> <b>sensors</b> can activate airbags), assisted driving, and the generation of offline driving reports. The advantages of ADAS include the rare occurrence of false positives [50] when accessing sensors and devices that are embedded in the vehicle. However, the key impediment of ADAS {{lies in the fact that}} they are typically available only in new and high-standard vehicles that have prohibitive prices for most drivers [50 – 52], even in developed countries. Furthermore, the installation of ADAS in older car models is either impossible or inordinately expensive.

In this thesis, the design, analysis and materials preparation of a micro-gyroscope using pizeoelectric material as the sensing element is presented. In the materials selection part of this thesis, the results of study of various piezoelectric materials are pursuited. As a result of this work, Aluminum Nitride (AlN), Zinc Oxide (ZnO) and Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) were chosen for further study due to their ease of fabrication and piezoelectric response. In the next part of this thesis, the principle of the micro-gyroscope is presented and its output voltage response is derived, calculated, and compared among the three piezoelectric materials. The calculated results show that PZT gives the largest output voltage response and hence efforts are placed on PZT in both physical modeling and materials preparation. The physical modeling of the micro-gyroscope is investigated by measuring the output voltage characteristics of the PZT crystal and the results found are in agreement with the theoretical predictions. Moreover, the layout design with different structures are drawn to test for different approaches for the proposed micro-gyroscope.

40|$|Sensors for {{coordinate}} measuring machines (CMM) are nowadays assessed {{within a}} measurement system, i. e. while mounted onto a CMM. This {{means that the}} accuracy or uncertainty of the sensor or probe is not really identified on its own, but {{may be influenced by}} the accuracy or uncertainty of the CMM on which the accuracy testing is done. Determining the accuracy and repeatability of a sensor, apart from the machines uncertainty, could yield useful information in several cases. For instance sensor damage can be ruled out after a machine <b>crash</b> if the <b>sensor</b> could be tested apart from the machines uncertainty. Also testing a new sensor on an older machine sometimes poses a problem, as the sensors inaccuracy can vanish in the total uncertainty of the measuring system due to a high CMM uncertainty. This paper describes the current standardised and accepted methods for evaluating the integration of a CMM sensor in the environment of the machine. Furthermore tests are described to exclude the CMM uncertainty as best as possible to come to an assessment that characterises the sole sensor uncertainty.
