25|$|At {{the time}} of his death his late work {{remained}} largely unprocessed, with about 2,500 rolls of undeveloped film, 6,500 rolls of developed but not proofed exposures, and about 3,000 rolls only realized as far as <b>contact</b> <b>sheets</b> being made. In total he left nearly 300,000 unedited images. The Garry Winogrand Archive at the Center for Creative Photography (CCP) comprises over 20,000 fine and work prints, 20,000 <b>contact</b> <b>sheets,</b> 100,000 negatives and 30,500 35mm colour slides as well as a small number of Polaroid prints and several amateur and independent motion picture films. Some of his undeveloped work was exhibited posthumously, and published by MoMA in the overview of his work Winogrand, Figments from the Real World (2003). Yet more from his largely unexamined archive of early and late work, plus well known photographs, were included in a retrospective touring exhibition beginning in 2013 and in the accompanying book Garry Winogrand (2013).|$|E

There, he also met Peter Andry, a senior executive at EMI, who suggested that Barda show his pictures to the art department at EMI. This immediately led to Barda's first major commission: to photograph Yehudi Menuhin, at EMI's No. 1 Studio, Abbey Road.|$|E

2500|$|After the war, Morath {{worked as}} a {{translator}} and journalist. In 1948, she was hired by Warren Trabant, first as Vienna Correspondent and later as the Austrian editor, for Heute, an illustrated magazine published by the Office of War Information in Munich. Morath encountered photographer Ernst Haas in post-war Vienna, and brought his work to Trabant's attention. Working together for Heute, Morath wrote articles to accompany Haas' pictures. In 1949, Morath and Haas were invited by Robert Capa to join the newly founded Magnum Photos in Paris, where she started as an editor. Working with <b>contact</b> <b>sheets</b> sent into the Magnum office by founding member Henri Cartier-Bresson fascinated Morath. [...] "I think that in studying his way of photographing I learned how to photograph myself, before I ever took a camera into my hand." ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanical}} alloying process for preparing Ag/LSCO electrical contact materials were explored, and process parameters were optimized, such as reaction environment, {{process control agent}} types and dosage, high-energy ball milling time and the composition of Ag@LSCO intermediate composite particles. The results show that Ag/LSCO electrical <b>contact</b> <b>sheet</b> with compact structure were successfully achieved, when the reaction environment is air, 3 wt% PEG 6000 was employed as process control agent, the {{high energy ball milling}} time is 40 h, and the Ag@LSCO intermediate composite particles were made of Ag and LSCO powders with mass ratio of 80 : 20. More importantly, the density, Vickers hardness and resistivity of Ag/LSCO electrical <b>contact</b> <b>sheet</b> all met or exceeded the requirements for practical application. Consequently, this study can provide a significant reference for industrial production of Ag/LSCO and other environmentally friendly silver-based electrical contact materials...|$|R
