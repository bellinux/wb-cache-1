50|$|<b>Curative</b> <b>hypnotherapy</b> is {{a method}} of working purely with the {{subconscious}} mind to understand and correct specific details which have {{played a part in}} the initial creation of a symptom. Its application relies heavily on Specific Questioning of the subconscious and the use of Ideomotor phenomenon (IMR) to identify the precise and unique life experiences which then led on to a triggering of a symptom at some later date.|$|E
5000|$|David Lesser [...] (1928 - 2001) was the {{originator}} {{of what we}} today understand by {{the term}} <b>Curative</b> <b>Hypnotherapy.</b> [...] It was he who first saw the possibility of finding the causes of people’s symptoms by {{using a combination of}} hypnosis, IMR and a method of specific questioning that he began to explore. Rather than try to override the subconscious information as Janet had done, he realised the necessity- and developed the process- to correct the wrong information. Lesser’s understanding of the logicality and simplicity of the subconscious {{led to the creation of}} the methodical treatment used today and it is his innovative work and understanding that underpins the therapy and is why the term ‘Lesserian’ was coined and trademarked.As the understanding of the workings of the subconscious continues to evolve, the application of the therapy continues to change. The three most influential changes have been in Specific Questioning (1992) to gain more accurate subconscious information; a subconscious cause/effect mapping system (SRBC)(1996) to streamline the process of <b>curative</b> <b>hypnotherapy</b> treatment; and the ‘LBR Criteria’ (2003) to be able to differentiate easier between causal and trigger events and helping to target more accurately the erroneous data which requires reinterpretation.|$|E
