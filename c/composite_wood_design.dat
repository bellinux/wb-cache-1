40|$|As part of {{a program}} to reduce wind turbine costs, an {{evaluation}} was conducted of a laminated <b>wood</b> <b>composite</b> blade for the Mod-OA 200 kW wind turbine. The effort included the design and fabrication concept for the blade, together with cost and load analyses. The blade structure is composed of laminated Douglas fir veneers for the primary spar and nose sections, and honeycomb cored plywood panels for the trailing edges sections. The attachment of the wood blade to the rotor hub was through load takeoff studs bonded into the blade root. Tests were conducted on specimens of the key structural components to verify the feasibility of the concept. It is concluded that the proposed <b>wood</b> <b>composite</b> blade <b>design</b> and fabrication concept is suitable for Mod-OA size turbines (125 -ft diameter rotor) at a cost that is very competitive with other methods of manufacture...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Silicon sol {{solution}} was introduced into poplar wood by vacuum-pressure impregnation process, {{and a series}} of composites with different weight percent of gain (WPG) were prepared. The structure and properties of the untreated and <b>composite</b> <b>wood</b> were investigated. Compared to untreated <b>wood,</b> <b>composite</b> <b>wood</b> had a promising potential to improve mechanical properties like bending strength, modulus of elasticity and surface hardness. SEM pictures of <b>composite</b> <b>wood</b> with 30. 3 WPG showed that the SiO 2 gels filled the pores of the wood but unchanged the structure and morphological arrangement.

50|$|Gladman et al. {{found that}} as θ {{approaches}} 0°, the curvature approximates the classical Timoshenko equation and performs similarly to a bimetallic strip. But as θ approaches 90°, the curvature transforms into a saddle shape. Understanding this, then, the team could carefully control {{the effects of}} anisotropy and break lines of symmetry to create helicoids, ruffled profiles, and more.David Correa et al. is working with <b>wood</b> <b>composite</b> materials that change shape based on their printed grain direction and anisotropic swelling when water is absorbed. This work is 3D printed and studied on the macro scale rather than micro scale, with layer heights at fractions of millimeters rather than microns. The filament used in this research is a <b>wood</b> <b>composite</b> which is 60% co-polyester and 40% cellulose. The co-polyester binds the cellulose together while the cellulose provides the hygroscopic properties to the composite. Two methods {{have been developed for}} this kind of printing. The first method uses only the <b>wood</b> <b>composite</b> material. <b>Designed</b> deformation shape is printed by controlling the grain pattern, grain orientation, print layer thickness, and print layer interaction. In this method, hygroscopic bending occurs perpendicular to the grain direction. The second method uses both the <b>wood</b> <b>composite</b> as well as standard 3D printing plastics. This is an extension of the first method that introduces a separate layer of non-hygroscopic material that will not swell when exposed to water. This idea builds off of previous research of thermal bimetal  properties based on their relative expansion. Hygroscopic bending occurs only within the <b>wood</b> <b>composite</b> layers when prints of this method are exposed to water. Therefore, deformation shape is a product of both the patterning of material layers as well as the grain of the <b>wood</b> <b>composite</b> layers, offering quicker and more severe deformation than <b>wood</b> <b>composite</b> construction alone. Both methods allow their materials to deform when subject to moisture, as well as regain their shape. The quickest method observed for shape change is by fully submerging prints in warm water.|$|R

40|$|The {{growing demand}} for {{structural}} <b>composite</b> <b>wood</b> panels has created an op-portunity for novel cost effective binder systems. Recently, much data has been published extolling the virtues of isocyanates (PMDI) as binders for <b>composite</b> <b>wood</b> panels intended for exterior applications. To date, {{there are two main}} drawbacks which inhibit the wide spread use of PMDI as binders: 1) generally, isocyanates are more expensive than the commonly used formaldehyde binder systems and 2) isocyanates adhere strongly to the caul plate during the pressing cycle. To overcome this sticking problem, release agents are necessary which in-creases the overall cost of an isocyanate binder system. This study was undertaken to investigate the cost/performance of isocyanate binder systems which incorporate significant levels of low cost reactive diluents. Several binder systems were evaluated which were cost/performance effective when compared to phenol-formaldehyde (exterior) and urea-formaldehyde (inter-ior) binders for <b>composite</b> <b>wood</b> panels. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that propylene carbonate (PC) is one such effective diluent in conjunction with isocyanates.

40|$|On April 26, 2007, the Air Resources Board (ARB) {{adopted a}} new {{airborne}} toxic control measure (ATCM) to reduce formaldehyde emissions from <b>composite</b> <b>wood</b> products. The regulation specifies technology-forcing limits for formaldehyde emissions from <b>composite</b> <b>wood</b> products. The limits vary by product type, {{and will be}} reduced in two phases between 2009 and 2012. The regulation requires manufacturers to certify their products before they are shipped to ensure they meet the emission limits. Manufacturers must have their routine formaldehyde emission testing verified by a third party certifier (TPC). The primary method used by third party certifiers for testing formaldehyde emissions from <b>composite</b> <b>wood</b> products is the so-called large chamber test, which requires a test chamber of at least 22 m 3 (22, 000 liters).
