40|$|Multiple {{immunosuppressant}} {{drugs are}} now available to prevent organ rejection. Because of their different modes of action, these drugs are often prescribed together {{as part of a}} multidrug protocol. This has created a challenge for clinical laboratories to analyze multiple immunosuppres-sant drugs in the same blood specimen. HPLC–mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) or-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) (1 – 6) assays can measure all of the common drugs. A practical issue with the use of HPLC-MS/MS is the necessity of preparing whole-blood calibrators containing cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and sirolimus.

40|$|Cell {{dysfunction}} is {{a hallmark}} of type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM) and comprises insulin secretory dysfunction and/or reduced b-cell mass (1). Normal b-cell func-tion requires tight coupling of glucose metabolism with insulin secretion via a well-defined pathway utilizing oxidative metabolism and ATP production (2). Moreover, b-cell gene expression and metabolism are tuned to sup-press pathways that would otherwise disrupt glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), such as lactate production (3, 4). Oversupply of glucose during T 2 DM can disrupt GSIS (glucotoxicity) via excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causing oxidative stress: b-cells are particularly susceptible due to relatively low expression of antioxidant enzymes (5).

Additionally, we tested a pattern of DNAmethylation of ribosomal DNA and selected genes such as IGF 2 and found no significant changes during development and aging.

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground The processing of sensory information from primary afferent neurons to the spinal dorsal horn may change significantly following tissue inflammation, ultimately leading to the development of chronic pain. Abnormal pain manifestations, such as allodynia, hyperalgesia, and spontaneous pain episodes occurring in these patho-logical pain states, are believed to result, at least in part, from plasticity phenomena in the spinal sensory system [1, 2]. Functional alterations in the properties of Aβ pri-mary afferents may notably account for the increased pain sensitivity observed under peripheral chronic inflam-mation. Variations in neurotransmitter content and release, changes in membrane receptor function and trafficking, and regulation of ion channel expression and activity may indeed enhance the excitability of Aβ-fibers and thus <b>contribute</b> <b>t...</b>|$|E
