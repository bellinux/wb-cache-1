40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to offer an {{overview}} of current legislative situation in international carriage of goods. Special attention is dedicated to carrier's liability in international transport of goods. In a global world, {{it is vital to}} keep balance between the rights and duties of both the carrier and the shipper. Otherwise, international trade would become next to impossible to perform. Therefore, dealing with the topic of carrier's liability might clarify certain aspects and possibly bring benefits to both contracting parties. This thesis consists of nine chapters. The three initial chapters present private international law and its methods. Next, the question of liability is briefly introduced. Finally, basic terms such as the carrier and the shipper are defined. In one of its subdivisions, the third chapter also mentions national regulations relevant to the topic discussed. On the contrary, the thesis as a whole addresses rules contained in international treaties. The following chapters are targeted on individual modes of transport, in order of appearance: carriage by rail, <b>carriage</b> <b>by</b> <b>road,</b> carriage by air, carriage by sea, carriage by inland waterways.

40|$|The Belgian Cour de Cassation {{decided in}} 2004 that CMR is only {{applicable}} when <b>carriage</b> <b>by</b> <b>road</b> is agreed upon contractually (contractual scope). This decision excludes {{a considerable number of}} contracts from CMR's scope, given the increasing integration of the transport chain, whereby the mode of transport is left to the discretion of the carrier. Moreover, the decision of the Cour de Cassation might allow parties under the contract to opt out of CMR altogether. However, as the Cour de Cassation accepted that the transport mode can also be agreed upon implicitly, this seems to leave a considerable margin of discretion to the lower courts to decide whether a contract falls within the scope of CMR or not. The first judgments by the lower courts adopted a strict interpretation and allowed parties to contract out of CMR. However, in this article it is suggested that the decision of the Cour de Cassation follows on automatically from the carrier's option to select the mode of transport and from the contractual interpretation given to the scope rule of CMR. Consequently the current position will most likely be upheld in future cases and will be assessed here {{in the light of the}} considerable criticism it has provoked...|$|E

The report deals with the presence of hazardous substances at industrial facilities and on <b>carriage</b> <b>by</b> <b>road</b> and rail but also the municipal fire brigades and other relevant authorities' ability to manage accidents involving hazardous substances in the County of Norrbotten. Substances with hazardous properties are handled in large quantities. The carriage of hazardous substances are made by road, rail, sea and air. Transport by road is the most frequent way to carry dangerous goods on land. In Sweden severe incidents involving hazardous substances are rare but still occur each year. To minimize the risks of harm to people, environment and property the operation of hazardous substances are surrounded by laws and regulations. This framework is designed to minimize the risks involved in manufacturing, operations and transportation of hazardous substances. Because of the large-scale industries hazardous substances are handled extensively in Norrbotten. Large quantities of explosive and oxidizing substances are handled by the mining industry in the municipalities of Gällivare and Kiruna. Corrosive acids, bases and peroxides are handled in the paper pulp mills in Piteå and Kalix while large amounts of petroleum products are handled in the port of Luleå and Piteå, but also occurs throughout the country. To what extent, amount and frequency, hazardous substances are transported to, from and within the county by road is currently not defined. Because of this, carriage of all classes of dangerous goods can not be excluded to occur. Flammable liquids, oxidizing agents and flammable gases are the most frequent carriage of dangerous goods by rail. However, hazardous substances from almost all hazard classes, except radioactive materials, were carried by rail in 2010. The locations that are recipients or senders of dangerous goods is Piteå, Luleå, Haparanda, Gällivare and Kiruna where Luleå and Haparanda receiving and dispatching the most dangerous goods. The rescue services’ ability to manage accidents involving hazardous substances differs between the municipalities in the county. Though a risk status of hazardous substances within the county not yet have been established, required capacity can’t be expressed. To meet a suitable contingency, an identification of the presence of hazardous substances in the County of Norrbotten is required. The information about the carriage of dangerous goods is incomplete and outdated. Therefore hold neither the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, the County Administrative Board nor the local rescue services the accurate knowledge about the situation. A national level effort is required to tackle the problem. The county is today suffering from a lack of capacity in the preventative work since accurate planning information can not be presented by, or to, the local governments.
