The Oscar equipment and human operator thus generated a deck of IBM cards for computer processing which contains the history of each target's position through time.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} its {{operation}} in 1956, ENIAC contained 20,000 vacuum tubes, 7200 crystal diodes, 1500 relays, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors and approximately 5,000,000 hand-soldered joints. It weighed more than 30 short tons (27 t), was roughly 2.4m × 0.9m × 30m (8 × 3 × 100 feet) in size, occupied 167m2 (1,800ft2) and consumed 150 kW of electricity. This power requirement led to the rumor that whenever the computer was switched on, lights in Philadelphia dimmed. Input was possible from an IBM card reader and an IBM <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> was used for output. These cards could be used to produce printed output offline using an IBM accounting machine, such as the IBM 405. While ENIAC had no system to store memory in its inception, these punch cards could be used for external memory storage. In 1953, a 100-word magnetic-core memory built by the Burroughs Corporation was added to ENIAC.|$|E

50|$|A lace <b>card</b> is a <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> {{with all}} holes punched (also called a whoopee card, {{ventilator}} card, flyswatter card, or IBM doily). They were mainly used as practical jokes to cause unwanted disruption in card readers. Card readers tended to jam when a lace card was inserted, as the resulting card had too little structural strength to avoid buckling inside the mechanism. <b>Card</b> <b>punches</b> could also jam trying to produce cards with all holes punched, owing to power-supply problems. When a lace card was fed through the reader, a card knife or card saw (a flat tool used with <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> readers and <b>card</b> <b>punches)</b> {{was needed to}} clear the jam.|$|R

50|$|<b>Punched</b> <b>cards</b> {{had been}} in use since the 1890s; their {{technology}} was mature and reliable. <b>Card</b> readers and <b>punches</b> developed for <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> machines were readily adaptable for computer use. Businesses were familiar with storing data on <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> and keypunch machines were widely employed. <b>Punched</b> <b>cards</b> were a better fit than other 1950s technologies, such as magnetic tape, for some computer applications as individual cards could easily be updated without having to access a computer.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> had {{a maximum}} rate of 150 cards per minute. Timing was quite {{critical}} throughout {{the operation of}} the <b>card</b> <b>punch,</b> the card reader and the printer, all being based on electromechanical principles. The basic <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> mechanism was manufactured by Bull, a French company which owned patents on 80 column punch card machines. The machine came in two versions, the P147 and the P67, the main difference being electromagnetic clutch or a solenoid operated mechanical [...] "dog" [...] clutch to initiate a punch cycle. Since many gears, electrical contact cams were affixed to the main shaft with taper pins, the P 67 with its severe stopping dog clutch would cause timing loss more frequently than the P 147. Most emergency maintenance time was spent replacing worn and damaged taper pins and retiming the machine. The <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> had a preread station, a punch station and a checkread station. The machine could be quite difficult to maintain and required much skill to troubleshoot and maintain. The machine cycle was oddly divided into 420 [...] "points" [...] or [...] "Bull degrees".|$|E
