The mathematical setting for this article is the lattice of partitions of a fixed overall frame of discernment. Different questions are represented by different partitions of this frame, and the <b>categorical</b> <b>relations</b> among these questions are represented by relations of qualitative conditional independence or dependence among the partitions. Qualitative conditional independence is a categorical rather than a probabilistic concept, but it is analogous to conditional independence for random variables. We show that efficient implementation of Dempster's rule is possible if the questions or partitions for which we have evidence are arranged in a qualitative Markov tree—a tree in which separations indicate relations of qualitative conditional independence. In this case, Dempster's rule can be implemented by propagating belief functions through the tree...|$|R

40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{explored the}} coding of categorical and coordinate spatial relations in visual-spatial short-term memory (VSSTM). Participants judged whether two stimuli presented successively {{on a computer}} screen were the same or different. On positional change trials the two stimuli differed in the position of one element. Positional changes were of two types, coordinate and categorical. On coordinate trials the position of one element changed by a small amount, but retained the categorical relationships (above, below, left of, right of) to all other elements. On categorical trials one element moved by the same amount but additionally changed its categorical relationship to one of the other elements (e. g., changed from below to above). Participants detected categorical changes more accurately than coordinate changes when the elements were independent locations marked by squares, indicating that the categorical relationships amongst the squares were encoded in memory. Furthermore, this categorical advantage was unmodulated by either the suppression of articulation (Experiment 2) or by the requirement to retain either colour-position associations or positions only (Experiment 3). When the elements to be remembered were the vertices of simple outline polygons (Experiment 4) there was no categorical advantage, establishing the effect as spatial in nature. Contrary to predictions derived from Postma and De Haan (1996), the employment of <b>categorical</b> <b>relations</b> appears not to be specifically linked to either verbal coding or to the requirement to associate objects with positions.

40|$|We {{examined}} the puzzling research findings that when extending novel nouns, preschoolers rely on shape similarity (rather than <b>categorical</b> <b>relations)</b> while in other task contexts (e. g., property induction) {{they rely on}} <b>categorical</b> <b>relations.</b> Taking into account research on children’s word learning, categorization, and inductive inference we assume that preschoolers have both a shape-based and a category-based word extension strategy available and can switch between these two depending on which information is easily available. To this end, we tested preschoolers on two versions of a novel-noun label extension task. First, we paralleled the standard extension task commonly used by previous research. In this case, as expected, preschoolers predominantly selected same-shape items. Second, we supported preschoolers’ retrieval of item-related information from memory by asking them simple questions about each item prior to the label extension task. Here, they switched to a category-based strategy, thus, predominantly selecting same-category items. Finally, we revealed that this shape-to-category shift is specific to the word learning context as {{we did not find}} it in a non-lexical classification task. These findings support our assumption that preschoolers’ decision about word extension change in accordance with the availability of information (from task context or by memory retrieval). We conclude by suggesting that preschoolers’ noun extensions can be conceptualized within the framework of heuristic decision making. This provides an ecologically plausible processing account with respect to which information is selected and how this information is integrated to act as a guideline for decision-making when novel words have to be generalized...|$|R
40|$|In the {{cognitive}} neuroscience {{literature on the}} distinction between categorical and coordinate spatial relations, {{it has often been}} observed that <b>categorical</b> spatial <b>relations</b> are referred to linguistically by words like English prepositions, many of which specify binary oppositions—e. g., above/below, left/right, on/off, in/out.

According to the Coordinate Relations Hypothesis (Cooper 2 ̆ 6 Wojan, 2000), individuals with prosopagnosia should perform normally relative to controls when discriminating visual primitives that are coded distinctly from one another by the visual system, but should be impaired relative to controls when discriminating visual primitives that are coded the same way.

In this study we address this textbook principle from a new angle. We studied retinotopic activation in early visual cortex, {{as a reflection of}} attentional distribution, in a spatial working memory task with either a categorical or a coordinate instruction. Participants were asked to memorize a dot position, with regard to a central cross, and to indicate whether a subsequent dot position matched the first dot position, either categorically (opposite quadrant of the cross) or coordinately (same distance to the centre of the cross). BOLD responses across the retinotopic maps of V 1, V 2, and V 3 indicate that the spatial distribution of cortical activity was different for categorical and coordinate instructions throughout the retention interval; a more local focus was found during categorical processing, whereas focus was more global for coordinate processing.

This requires identifying the visual features that best predict the ‘essence’ of objects (e. g. edibility), rather than categorizing objects based on the most salient features in a given context. To gain this capacity, visual category learning (VCL) relies on multiple cognitive processes. These may include unsupervised statistical learning, that requires observing multiple objects for learning the statistics of their features. Other learning processes enable incorporating different sources of supervisory information, alongside the visual features of the categorized objects, from which the <b>categorical</b> <b>relations</b> between few objects can be deduced.

Current study examined the effects of this so called lateralized pointing (LP) on spatial relation processing, which also has a strong lateralization pattern. <b>Categorical</b> <b>relations</b> are mainly processed in the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere is primarily involved with coordinate processing. Therefore, it was hypothesized that right LP improves performance on a categorical task and left LP improves performance on a coordinate task. Students from Utrecht University performed a cross-dot task both before and after LP. In order to control for possible effects of tiredness or practice, some participants performed the cross-dot task twice, but without intermediate pointing. Results showed that regardless of pointing direction, performance on the categorical task improved as a result of LP, while coordinate processing did not differ as a result of LP. Given these results, it is likely that the left hemisphere is activated as a result of a sensorimotor process which consequently activated left superior parietal lobe, rather than an attentional bias {{to one side of the}} visual field...|$|R
