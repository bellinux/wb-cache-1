50|$|Wilson Wood Colliery SD682721The first shafts were sunk in 1854 just as {{the railway}} came to Ingleton. The shafts passed through the Four Foot seam and below it the Six Foot seam at 130 yards. The seam dipped to the north at a slope of 1 in 4. A 135m <b>cross-measure</b> <b>drift</b> was dug {{horizontally}} {{to connect with the}} Four Foot seam in 1858. Both seams were worked. Wilsons Wood was troubled by water ingress. A serious flood in December 1865 was followed by closure in October 1866. The only other employment in Ingleton was at the cotton mill which had burnt down two years earlier and reopened after the Cotton Famine in 1867. Men from Wilsons Wood sought work in Barnsley. After a change of ownership, extra steam engines were bought. One from Coates Old Mill in Barnoldswick. Pumping out took seven months and 58 million gallons of water was removed while 480 gallon per second continued to flow in. The mine was reopened.|$|E
50|$|Following {{inspection}} of the deeper seams, {{it was decided to}} only work the Deep Hard coal at that point. A 1 in 2 <b>cross-measures</b> <b>drift</b> was driven from the Top Hard seam for ventilation purposes and the opening-out began. Three longwall faces in the 3 ft thick seam were commenced, but the ensuing recession appears to have made it uneconomic and production ceased in 1927, all output then being concentrated back in the Top Hard seam, the workings of which were now becoming quite extensive. By this time, most of the coal {{to the north of the}} river Meden had been worked out and production had shifted to the reserves to the south. By the late 1930s, however, these reserves were diminishing rapidly, and exploratory working began in the two underlying seams, the Dunsil and 1st Waterloo.|$|R
50|$|At {{about this}} time, <b>cross-measure</b> <b>drifts</b> were also being driven {{down to the}} {{underlying}} Piper seam {{to the south of}} the pit-bottom and a new face was headed out. This face advanced below the earlier workings in the Deep Hard until it had reached a position beyond their final working point. Near to the pit-bottom, the Piper seam was separated from the Deep Hard by about 10yds but as the face moved out, the distance decreased until they were separated by only a short distance. At this point short drifts were driven up into the Deep Hard and new faces were then opened out back in this seam and within a short distance they were working a combined thickness of coal of about 2 - 2.5 m. Two other faces had been opened out closer to the pit-bottom in the Piper, but no further development took place in that seam except for a parallel one running back towards the pit-bottom.|$|R
5000|$|Old Pit WorkingThe coal lease of the Old Pit {{was bought}} in 1903 by [...] "Ingleton Collieries Ltd" [...] {{and the manager}} {{continued}} to be James Barker. Nellie Pit and Richard Pit were mined as the company {{changed its name to}} Inglenook and made test borings and acquired further coal rights. The rights passed to the New Ingleton Collieries Company which mined it as Old Pit. They sunk a new 22 yard deep 6 feet diameter shaft at Dolands to the Six Foot seam. In 1911 the company worked the Six Foot seam westward to a north-south fault. A <b>cross-measures</b> <b>drift</b> was dug northwards to intersect the Three Foot and Four Foot coals and between 1911 and 1914, 45 acres was worked. A Schiele fan for ventilation on Nellie Pit injected 5000 cubic feet of air a minute. In 1911 illumination was provided by naked lights. Old Pit closed in October 1914.|$|R
