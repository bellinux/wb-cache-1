5|$|Grills {{are made}} of several types of metal (often silver, gold or platinum) that are {{sometimes}} inlaid with precious stones; they are generally removable, though some may be permanently attached to the teeth. Gold grills <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> 10-karat, up to 24-karat gold. The gold can be tinted yellow, white and rose color.|$|E
5|$|The {{chlorine}} oxides are well-studied {{in spite of}} their instability (all of them are endothermic compounds). They are important because they are produced when chlorofluorocarbons undergo photolysis in the upper atmosphere and cause the destruction of the ozone layer. None of them <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> directly reacting the elements.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} inferences that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> the A-not-B error has been challenged. Studies that {{have contributed to}} this {{discussion}} have examined the contribution of memory limitations, difficulty with spatial localization, and difficulty in inhibiting the motor act of reaching to location A on the A-not-B error.|$|E

5|$|To {{deal with}} the {{complexity}} of bronze reproduction, France has promulgated several laws since 1956 which limit reproduction to twelve casts– the maximum number that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> an artist's plasters and still be considered his work. As {{a result of this}} limit, The Burghers of Calais, for example, is found in fourteen cities.|$|E
5|$|A few {{deductions}} {{can also}} be made from the satellite communications. The first deduction that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> the satellite communications is that the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19—seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea. The varying BFO values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed. The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the satellite, so it {{can also be}} deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.|$|E

5|$|According to the International Energy Agency, {{cellulosic}} ethanol biorefineries {{could allow}} biofuels {{to play a}} much bigger role in the future than {{organizations such as the}} IEA previously thought. Cellulosic ethanol <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Crop residues (such as corn stalks, wheat straw and rice straw), wood waste, and municipal solid waste are potential sources of cellulosic biomass. Dedicated energy crops, such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be sustainably produced in many regions.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimate}} of a horse's age <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> looking at its teeth. The teeth continue to erupt throughout life and are worn down by grazing. Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear pattern, changes in tooth shape, {{and changes in}} the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. This allows a very rough {{estimate of}} a horse's age, although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear.|$|E
5|$|Invasive {{measures}} include electrocorticography, {{which uses}} electrodes placed {{directly on the}} exposed surface of the brain. This method is used in cortical stimulation mapping, {{used in the study}} of the relationship between cortical areas and their systemic function. By using much smaller microelectrodes, single-unit recordings <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> a single neuron that give a high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. This has enabled the linking of brain activity to behaviour, and the creation of neuronal maps.|$|E

5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} are structurally {{simple and}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> short RNA sequences; the smallest is just 44 nucleotides and {{is found in}} the mRNA of a heat-shock protein, hsp17, in Synechocystis species PCC 6803. Generally these RNA elements range in length from 60-110 nucleotides and they typically contain a hairpin with a small number of mismatched base pairs which reduce the stability of the structure, thereby allowing easier unfolding in response to a temperature increase.|$|E
5|$|None of the {{original}} engines survived into preservation, however {{progress is being made}} by a Registered Charity (No. 1062320), the Standard Steam Locomotive Company, on constructing a new locomotive {{that would have been the}} first of the uncompleted batch of 15, number 72010 Hengist. As 999 BR standard steam locomotives were built in the years up to 1960 the builders consider this is the 1000th locomotive build to be commenced to a British Railways standard design. The Standard Steam Locomotive Company believes that significant costs will be avoided as many of the required cast parts <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> patterns held by fellow members of the British Railways Standard Locomotive Owners Group (BRSLOG).|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, trees produce {{wood with}} a wavy grain, greatly {{increasing}} the value for decorative veneers. The wood is a medium weight for a hardwood, weighing 630kg per cubic metre. It {{is a traditional}} wood for use in making the backs, necks and scrolls of violins. The wood is often marketed as rippled sycamore. Whistles <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> straight twigs when the rising sap allows the bark to be separated, and these, and sycamore branches, are used in customs associated with early May in Cornwall. The wood is used for fuel, being easy to saw and to split with an axe, producing a hot flame and good embers when burnt.|$|E

50|$|One {{issue is}} that {{the top of the}} <b>can</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> a blend of {{aluminum}} and magnesium to increase its strength. When the <b>can</b> <b>is</b> melted for recycling, the mixture is unsuitable for either the top or the bottom/side. Instead of mixing recycled metal with more aluminum (to soften it) or magnesium (to harden it), a new approach uses annealing to produce an alloy that works for both.|$|R
5|$|The Worcestershire County Air Ambulance, {{which has}} been {{operating}} since 1991, moved to the Strensham site in 1998 under a sponsorship deal with Take a Break, who were operating the service area at the time. Access to the air ambulance site <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> the service station itself or from the local road network via the staff entrance to the services. An open day is held at the site each year {{to raise money for}} the operation of the air ambulance. In May 2008 the operational hours of the service was increased from 12 to 14 hours each day, as a result of this, landing lights needed to be installed at the base to enable night time use.|$|E
5|$|The {{streets in}} Yarralumla are named after Australian {{governors}} and botanists. Most {{of the older}} streets in the suburb are laid out on an approximately rectangular grid with some curved sections, while the more hilly eastern end of the suburb, including the embassy district, is set out with contour-guided roads. Major roads in Yarralumla include Banks Street, Novar Street and Hopetoun Circuit in a north-south direction and Schlich Street, Loftus Street and Weston Street running east-west. Being a dormitory suburb, there are no major through roads. Access {{to the rest of}} the city <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> Adelaide Avenue, Commonwealth Avenue, Lady Denman Drive and Cotter Road, all of which run along the borders of the suburb. From these roads, entry to the suburb can be gained by turning into roads such as Coronation Drive, Hopetoun Circuit and Novar Street.|$|E
25|$|The {{fruit is}} high in vitamin C. The unripe fruit is {{extremely}} astringent. The ripe fruit may be eaten raw, cooked or dried. Molasses <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> the fruit pulp. A tea <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>from</b> the leaves and the roasted seed {{is used as a}} coffee substitute. Other popular uses include desserts such as persimmon pie, persimmon pudding, or persimmon candy.|$|E
