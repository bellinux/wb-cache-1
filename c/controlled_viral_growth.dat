40|$|Tumour {{heterogeneity}} {{is a key}} hurdle for {{the effective}} treatment of cancer using oncolytic viruses (OVs). A {{better understanding of the}} pathways involved in delineating tumour cell resistance and hypersensitivity to OVs is critical in order to guide the development of new therapeutic strategies to enhance OVs. In this thesis, I performed a comparative genetic and epigenetic study of the murine OV-resistant colon cancer cell line CT 26. WT and its hypersensitive subclone CT 26. lacZ. This study led to the identification of retroviral insertion sites in AKAP 7 and TP 53 RK genes, that are potentially involved in conveying sensitivity to infection by OVs and the dysregulation of the interferon antiviral response in the CT 26. lacZ cell line. Gene overexpression and gene silencing experiments suggest a functional role of these proteins in <b>controlling</b> <b>viral</b> <b>growth.</b> Further investigation of these genes and their relationship to antiviral response pathways is warranted and may lead to novel strategies for improving the therapeutic activity of OVs...|$|R
40|$|Coxsackievirus B 3 (CVB 3) {{is a small}} RNA virus {{associated}} with diseases such as myocarditis, meningitis, and pancreatitis. We have previously demonstrated that proteasome inhibition reduces CVB 3 replication and attenuates virus-induced myocarditis. However, the underlying mechanisms by which the ubiquitin/proteasome system regulates CVB replication remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of REG, {{a member of the}} 11 S proteasome activator, in CVB 3 replication. We showed that overexpression of REG promoted CVB 3 replication but that knockdown of REG led to reduced CVB 3 replication. We further demonstrated that REG-mediated p 53 proteolysis contributes, as least in part, to the proviral function of REG. Although total protein levels of REG remained unaltered after CVB 3 infection, virus infection induced a redistribution of REG from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, rendering an opportunity for a direct interaction of REG with viral proteins and/or host proteins (e. g., p 53), which <b>controls</b> <b>viral</b> <b>growth</b> and thereby enhances viral infectivity. Further analyses suggested a potential modification of REG by SUMO following CVB 3 infection, which was verified by both in vitro and in vivo sumoylation assays. Sumoylation of REG {{may play a role in}} its nuclear export during CVB 3 infection. Taken together, our results present the first evidence that the host REG pathway is utilized and modified during CVB 3 infection to promote efficient viral replication. Viruses often adapt to the existing host cellular machinery t...|$|R
40|$|This new assay of viral cell-mediated {{immunity}} is sensitive, reproducible, {{and in many}} ways resembles the in vivo state. The spread of herpes simplex virus between adjacent monolayer cells was inhibited in the presence of spleen cells from guinea pigs sensitized to that virus. This in vitro <b>control</b> of <b>viral</b> <b>growth</b> was quantified by determining plaque size in monolayers to which were added sensitized spleen cells as opposed to nonsensitized or no spleen cells. The simple measurement of plaque size reduction as an in vitro test of viral {{cell-mediated immunity}} is described. In addition to correlating highly with skin testing and macrophage migration inhibition as a test of viral cell-mediated immunity, the ability of sensitized spleen cells to reduce plaque size developed by day 7, paralleling the onset of delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity. The specificity of this lymphocyte-mediated interaction was demonstrated by the inability of herpes simplex virus-sensitized spleen cells to alter the growth of vaccinia virus in cell culture. A ratio of sensitized spleen cells to monolayer cells of 6 : 1 resulted in significant plaque size reduction on both HEp- 2 and conjunctiva monolayers. The data presented demonstrate the potential usefulness of plaque size reduction as a technically simple, specific, and more direct measure of cellular antiviral activity...|$|R
40|$|Influenza is an {{infectious}} disease that primarily attacks the respiratory system. Innate immunity provides both {{a very early}} defense to influenza virus invasion and an effective <b>control</b> of <b>viral</b> <b>growth.</b> Previous modelling studies of virus-innate immune response interactions have focused on infection with a single virus and, while improving our understanding of viral and immune dynamics, {{have been unable to}} effectively evaluate the relative feasibility of different hypothesised mechanisms of antiviral immunity. In recent experiments, we have applied consecutive exposures to different virus strains in a ferret model, and demonstrated that viruses differed in their ability to induce a state of temporary immunity or viral interference capable of modifying the infection kinetics of the subsequent exposure. These results imply that virus-induced early immune responses may be responsible for the observed viral hierarchy. Here we introduce and analyse a family of within-host models of re-infection viral kinetics which allow for different viruses to stimulate the innate immune response to different degrees. The proposed models differ in their hypothesised mechanisms of action of the non-specific innate immune response. We compare these alternative models in terms of their abilities to reproduce the re-exposure data. Our results show that 1) a model with <b>viral</b> <b>control</b> mediated solely by a virus-resistant state, as commonly considered in the literature, is not able to reproduce the observed viral hierarchy; 2) the synchronised and desynchronised behaviour of consecutive virus infections is highly dependent upon the interval between primary virus and challenge virus exposures and is consistent with virus-dependent stimulation of the innate immune response. Our study provides the first mechanistic explanation for the recently observed influenza viral hierarchies and demonstrates the importance of understanding the host response to multi-strain viral infections. Re-exposure experiments provide a new paradigm in which to study the immune response to influenza and its role in <b>viral</b> <b>control.</b> [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of PLoS Computational Biology is the property of Public Library of Science and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

40|$|Abstract Background Mathematical {{modeling}} {{is important}} to provide insight in the complicated pathway of RNA silencing. RNA silencing is an RNA based mechanism that is widely used by eukaryotes to fight viruses, and to control gene expression. Results We here present the first mathematical model that combines <b>viral</b> <b>growth</b> with RNA silencing. The model involves a plus-strand RNA virus that replicates through a double-strand RNA intermediate. The model of the RNA silencing pathway consists of cleavage of viral RNA into siRNA by Dicer, target cleavage of viral RNA via the RISC complex, and a secondary response. We found that, depending {{on the strength of}} the silencing response, different <b>viral</b> <b>growth</b> patterns can occur. Silencing can decrease <b>viral</b> <b>growth,</b> cause oscillations, or clear the virus completely. Our model can explain various observed phenomena, even when they seem contradictory at first: the diverse responses to the removal of RNA dependent RNA polymerase; different <b>viral</b> <b>growth</b> curves; and the great diversity in observed siRNA ratios. Conclusion The model presented here is an important step in the understanding of the natural functioning of RNA silencing in viral infections. </p...|$|R
40|$|Viruses are {{obligatory}} intracellular pathogens requiring host machinery {{for survival}} and reproduction. Differing from living organisms, which can grow where nutrients are available, viruses absolutely require hijacking of host machineries {{to complete their}} life cycle. Enveloped viruses evolved to have dedicated strategies to passively sense environmental cues to ensure that initiation of infection occurs at the correct moment and place. One general strategy used by enveloped viruses is to precisely control activation of their envelope glycoprotein just prior entry into host cells. Influenza A virus (AIV) is the causative agent of influenza illness and causes both economical and public health problems globally and annually. As a successful pathogen infecting {{a wide range of}} animals, IAV excels in sensing the environment to ensure efficient infection by employing two sequential activating steps during viral entry: proteolytic cleavage for priming of the hemagglutinin (HA) and low-pH-triggered conformational changes allowing release of the fusion peptide. Proteolytic cleavage of influenza HA <b>controls</b> <b>viral</b> pathogenesis by influencing <b>viral</b> <b>growth</b> rate and <b>viral</b> tropism. The primary sequence and tertiary structure of the HA determine the overall properties of HA activation and hence, viral pathogenesis. Mutations on the primary sequence of the HA cleavage site affect viral activation in two dimensions, 1) HA activation efficiency and 2) alteration in protease repertoire for HA activation. The former modulates <b>viral</b> <b>growth</b> kinetics and the later is important for viral tropism. Mutations that modifies HA tertiary structure also {{play an important role in}} viral activation, in particular virus growth. In this thesis, I describe three interrelated studies of mutations on primary and tertiary structure of HA and their consequence on HA cleavage and viral pathogenesis. These mutations also allow influenza virus to interact with prokaryotic pathogens and open up another dimension in virus-bacteria-host interactions and synergy. 2019 - 01 - 2...|$|R

To investigate the role of G-to-A mutations in HIV- 1 pathogenesis, we isolated, amplified, and sequenced HIV- 1 sequences (vif, gag, and env) from 29 therapy-naive HIV- 1 -infected individuals. The levels of G-to-A mutations correlated with the expression levels of hA 3 G in the vif (rho[*]=[*] 0. 438, p[*]=[*] 0. 041) and the env regions (rho[*]=[*] 0. 392, p[*]=[*] 0. 038), but not in the gag region (rho[*]=[*] 0. 131, p[*]=[*] 0. 582).

40|$|Our {{previous}} studies with influenza A viruses {{indicated that the}} association of M 1 with viral RNA and nucleoprotein (NP) {{is required for the}} efficient formation of helical ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and for the nuclear export of RNPs. RNA-binding domains of M 1 map to the following two independent regions: a zinc finger motif at amino acid positions 148 to 162 and a series of basic amino acids (RKLKR) at amino acid positions 101 to 105. Altering the zinc finger motif of M 1 reduces <b>viral</b> <b>growth</b> slightly. A substitution of Ser for Arg at either position 101 or position 105 of the RKLKR domain partially reduces the nuclear export of RNP and viral replication. To further understand the role of the zinc finger motif and the RKLKR domain in viral assembly and replication, we introduced multiple mutations by using reverse genetics to modify these regions of the M gene of influenza virus A/WSN/ 33. Of multiple mutants analyzed, a double mutant, R 101 S-R 105 S, of RKLKR resulted in a temperature-sensitive phenotype. The R 101 S-R 105 S double mutant had a greatly reduced ratio of M 1 to NP in viral particles and a weaker binding of M 1 to RNPs.

However, {{it is often difficult to}} estimate pathogen growth because patients are treated immediately upon the detection of infection, leaving only one nonzero untreated reading. Previous approaches have relied on the flawed assumption that pathogen loads just prior to detection are at the assay detection threshold. We have developed a novel method for estimating the pathogen growth rate from a single reading and investigated the initial growth of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients. We applied this approach to CMV viral loads measured at least weekly in 122 patients in the 3 months posttransplant. <b>Viral</b> <b>growth</b> rates were estimated by using a modeling approach that accounts for the viral load and the time since the last negative reading. <b>Viral</b> <b>growth</b> rates decreased rapidly within the first week, from 0. 72 /day (doubling time, 0. 96 day) at the point of reactivation to 0. 22 /day (doubling time, 3. 1 days) at 1 week.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comA large number of experimental studies have been performed {{over the past decade}} in an attempt to develop a vaccine for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These studies have used a variety of approaches aimed at stimulating both antibody-mediated and cell-mediated immunity. Many of these experiments have been performed in macaque models of HIV. Analysis and modeling of the results of these studies provide the opportunity to investigate the mechanisms and limitations of <b>viral</b> <b>control</b> by humoral and cell-mediated immunity. These studies suggest that CD 8 + T cells do ‘too little too late’ to prevent the establishment of viral infection and latency. By contrast, passively administered antibody acts extremely early to reduce the initial inoculum and slow <b>viral</b> <b>growth.</b> In both cases, reduction in peak viral load appears crucial to the maintenance of CD 4 + T cells in acute infection and for effective long-term <b>viral</b> <b>control.</b> The insights gained from studies of simian human immunodeficiency virus infection have important implications for HIV vaccination. However, important questions remain as to whether differences in pathogenesis in HIV will lead to different ‘rules of engagement’ for immune control of virus. Miles P. Davenport, Ruy M.
