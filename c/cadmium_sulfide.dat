5|$|Cadmium is a {{component}} of some compound semiconductors, such as <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulfide,</b> cadmium selenide, and cadmium telluride, used for light detection and solar cells.

5|$|The {{photostability}} of pigments can {{be enhanced}} {{by the addition of}} cerium. It provides pigments with light fastness and prevents clear polymers from darkening in sunlight. Television glass plates are subject to electron bombardment, which tends to darken them by creation of F-center color centers. This effect is suppressed by addition of cerium oxide. Cerium is also an essential component of phosphors used in TV screens and fluorescent lamps. Cerium sulfide forms a red pigment that stays stable up to 350°C. The pigment is a nontoxic alternative to <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulfide</b> pigments.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{vanadate}} is an opaque yellow pigment in artists' oil and acrylic paint. This compound is a non-toxic lightfast {{substitute for}} lemon yellow pigments {{such as the}} <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulfides</b> and the lead/strontium/barium chromates. Unlike lead chromate+lead sulfate lemon, bismuth vanadate does not readily blacken with UV exposure.|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{is still}} {{considered}} {{as one of the}} cleanest energy to date. In order to achieve a sustainable process for the hydrogen production, photocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen would be a suitable approach. However, due to the low efficiency and lack of stability, the developments of active and stable photocatalysts, especially those that can work under visible light irradiation are still highly required. On the other hand, <b>cadmium</b> zinc <b>sulfide</b> has been recognized as an active visible light-driven photocatalyst for hydrogen production. Unfortunately, the <b>cadmium</b> zinc <b>sulfide</b> is usually not stable. In order to enhance not only the activity but also the stability of the <b>cadmium</b> zinc <b>sulfide</b> photocatalyst, various modifications were carried out by addition of tin, copper, or silver via hydrothermal and co-precipitation methods [1 - 3]. It was demonstrated that the hydrothermal method was better than the co-precipitation method to prepare the modified <b>cadmium</b> zinc <b>sulfide</b> photocatalysts. The addition of optimum amount of tin, copper, or silver by hydrothermal method successfully improved both activity and stability of the <b>cadmium</b> zinc <b>sulfide</b> photocatalyst for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. several reasons were proposed for such enhancements, which were high crystallinity, good absorption at visible light region (narrow band gap energy), and suppression of electron -hole recombination...|$|R
25|$|Several toxic heavy metals, however, have Ksp values {{substantially}} {{lower than}} those of the sulfides of iron and manganese - for example, <b>cadmium</b> (II) <b>sulfide</b> (CdS) has a Ksp equal to 10−32.85. This means <b>cadmium</b> binds <b>sulfide</b> with a much higher affinity than does iron. When water contaminated with cadmium ions comes into contact with sediment containing FeS, the cadmium displaces the iron according to Equation 3 and becomes tightly bound to the sulfide ion.|$|R

40|$|Pigments {{based on}} cadmium {{selenide}} sulphides and <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulfides</b> were analysed as regarding their structure and stability against the laser irradiation, {{a new technique}} for cleaning the painted surfaces in artwork restoration. The pulsed Nd:YAG laser radiation determines the effusion of some sulphur from the red pigment Cd(S,Se) and significant decrease of the average size of the crystallites. The color turns to dark red. For yellow pigment (CdS) no change of crystallite size was detected after laser irradiation...|$|R
25|$|Pigment {{production}} {{usually involves}} {{the precipitation of}} CdS, the washing of the solid precipitate to remove soluble cadmium salts followed by calcination (roasting) to convert it to the hexagonal form followed by milling to produce a powder. When <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulfide</b> selenides are required the CdSe is co-precipitated with CdS and the cadmium sulfoselenide is created during the calcination step.|$|E
25|$|Resistive {{opto-isolator}} (RO), {{also called}} photoresistive opto-isolator, vactrol (after a genericized trademark introduced by Vactec, Inc. in the 1960s), analog opto-isolator or lamp-coupled photocell, is an optoelectronic device {{consisting of a}} source and detector of light, which are optically coupled and electrically isolated from each other. The light source is usually a light-emitting diode (LED), a miniature incandescent lamp, or sometimes a neon lamp, whereas the detector is a semiconductor-based photoresistor made of cadmium selenide (CdSe) or <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulfide</b> (CdS). The source and detector are coupled through a transparent glue or through the air.|$|E
25|$|Pigments appear {{the colors}} they are because they {{selectively}} reflect and absorb certain wavelengths of visible light. White light is a roughly equal {{mixture of the}} entire spectrum of visible light with a wavelength in a range from about 375 or 400 nanometers to about 760 or 780nm. When this light encounters a pigment, parts of the spectrum are absorbed by the molecules or ions of the pigment. In organic pigments such as diazo or phthalocyanine compounds the light is absorbed by the conjugated systems of double bonds in the molecule. Some of the inorganic pigments such as vermilion (mercury sulfide) or cadmium yellow (<b>cadmium</b> <b>sulfide)</b> absorb light by transferring an electron from the negative ion (S2−) to the positive ion (Hg2+ or Cd2+). Such compounds are designated as charge-transfer complexes, with broad absorption bands that subtract most of {{the colors of the}} incident white light. The other wavelengths or parts of the spectrum are reflected or scattered. The new reflected light spectrum creates the appearance of a color. Pigments, unlike fluorescent or phosphorescent substances, can only subtract wavelengths from the source light, never add new ones.|$|E
50|$|Cadmium {{pigments}} are a {{class of}} pigments that have cadmium {{as one of the}} chemical components. Most of cadmium produced worldwide has been used in the production of rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries — themselves being replaced by other rechargeable nickel-chemistry cell varieties like NiMH cells — but about half the remaining consumption of cadmium, which is about 2,000 tons annually, is used to produce colored cadmium pigments. The principal pigments are a family of yellow/orange/red <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulfides</b> and sulfoselenides as well as compounds with metals other than cadmium.|$|R

30|$|This type {{of glass}} {{is similar to}} the type 1 with the {{addition}} of calcium, probably lime delivered. It was found on the bugle beads as well as the red stones on both shoes. Small differences in arsenic content shows potential for differentiating between the bugle beads with a slightly lower amount and the red stones with a slightly higher amount. Slightly higher arsenic amounts are consistent in the red stones. Similar to the type 1 glass, the elemental composition of the type 2 glass indicates additions of zinc oxide, selenium and <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulfides</b> which may have been used to obtain the ruby color.|$|R

30|$|Cadmium yellow {{pigments}} commonly {{exist as}} solid solutions where zinc, mercury, or selenium substitutions {{can be used}} to change the pigment’s hue. Yellow <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulfides</b> most frequently occur as a solid solution with zinc sulfide as Cd(1 −x)ZnxS [37]. Micro-Raman spectroscopy has been used to identify these solid solutions, which can have implications about the pigment’s stability. The poorly crystalline nature of the cadmium yellow pigments in this work, and the fluorescence of the oil binder led to cadmium yellow pigments being inferred by the presence of cadmium in yellow regions (SEM-EDX and XRF mapping) and the pigment’s characteristic infrared luminescence. Further work by µXPD could be used to determine the lattice parameters indicating the degree of Zn substitution into the crystal lattice.|$|R
