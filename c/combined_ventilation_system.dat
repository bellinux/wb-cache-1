40|$|International audienceThe French {{regulation}} on {{residential building}} ventilation relies on an overall and continuous air renewal. The fresh air should enter the building through the “habitable rooms” while the polluted air is extracted {{in the service}} rooms. In this way, internal air is drained from the lowest polluted rooms to the highest polluted ones. However, internal pressure equilibrium and air movements in buildings result from the <b>combined</b> effects <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> and parameters such as wind, temperature difference or doors opening. This paper aims to analyse the influence of these parameters on pollutant transfer within buildings. In so doing, experiments are carried out using tracer gas release for representing pollution sources in an experimental house. Mechanical exhaust, balanced and natural <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems</b> are thus tested. Results show the followings: - For all cases, internal doors' opening causes the most important pollutant spread. - When doors are closed, the best performances are obtained with balanced ventilation. - Independently to heating and doors opening, pollutant transfer from lower levels {{to higher levels of}} the building is limited in the case of balanced ventilation. - Pollutant spread is quite similar whether the whole building is heated or not...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of radiant cooling has stimulated {{an interest in}} new systems based on coupling ventilation with radiant cooling. However, radiant cooling systems may cause condensation to form on an active surface under warm and humid conditions during the cooling season. This phenomenon occurs when surface temperature falls below dew point. To prevent condensation, air humidity needs to be reduced with a dehumidification device or a mechanical <b>ventilation</b> <b>system.</b> There are two main options to achieve this. The first is to use dehumidification devices that reduce humidity, but are not coupled with ventilation, i. e. devices that handle room air and leave air change to infiltrations. The second is to <b>combine</b> a mechanical <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> with dehumidifying finned coils. This study analyzes the floor radiant cooling of a typical residential apartment within a multi-storey building in three Italian climate zones {{by means of a}} detailed simulation tool.

40|$|Due to {{intensive}} use {{of energy and}} high costs in several European countries it is often debated if air-conditioning of buildings is recommendable or should be prohibited by law. Of course, air-conditioning will give better control of the indoor temperature and then improve comfort and productivity.

By air-conditioning, heating, cooling and ventilation are achieved alone by air, where the cooling and heating requirements {{determine the amount of}} required air circulation. Alternatively, the heating and sensible component of cooling may be done by hydronic radiant heating and cooling systems, where pipes are embedded in concrete slabs between each storey.

The first step is real measurement of indoor environment and heating energy in houses employing passive <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems.</b> The second is analysis of total primary energy consumption of heating, cooling and ventilation by using a computational program based on the extended heating degree method. Results – From the measurement results, a passive <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> can be used in the regions from the viewpoint of the indoor environment. From the calculations results, a passive stack <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> with a self regulating damper yields less energy than typical mechanical <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems.</b> It is confirmed that a solar heating panel have a positive effect on heating energy reduction even in hot humid region.
