Her works were also shown in Boston, Chicago, and New York City. Norcross shared a studio with Alix d'Anethan, whose paintings, influenced by Puvis, were of pastoral and <b>contemporary</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{most of the}} {{writings}} that have survived from this period are religious in nature, there is sufficient literary evidence that secular writing was also popular in the imperial court. Some of these writings carry useful information on urban life, grandeur of the imperial and provincial courts, royal weddings and ceremonies. Other works refer the general town planning, fortifications and ordnance details at Vijayanagara and other important cities, irrigation reservoirs, merchants and shops dealing {{in a variety of}} commodities. On occasion, authors dwell on mythical cities that reflect their idealised views on <b>contemporary</b> <b>life.</b> Commonly found in these works are description of artists and professionals and their relationship with the court. These included poets, bards, composers, painters, sculptors, dancers, theatrical performers and even wrestlers. Others who find mention are political leaders, ambassadors, concubines, accountants, goldsmiths, moneylenders and even servants and door keepers.|$|E

5|$|Brahmashiva, {{the court}} poet of King Vikramaditya VI, earned the title Kavichakravarti ("Emperor among poets") from his patron for his writing Samayaparikshe ("Analysis of the doctrine", c.1125). In this {{philosophical}} writing, containing touches of propagandist satire and humor, the author seeks {{to prove the}} virtues of Jainism superior to all other contemporary religions. Brahmashiva portrays <b>contemporary</b> <b>life</b> and beliefs {{of the people of}} the Kannada-speaking region. He criticises Hinduism and the conversion of a Jain temple originally dedicated to the Tirthankar Chandrapraba in Kholapur into a Hindu temple deifying the goddess Mahalakshmi. He expresses reservation regarding the existence of religious cosmopolitanism within a household where family members followed multiple faiths. The author is concerned about the eroding popularity of Jainism in southern India due to the rising popularity of the Veerashaiva movement. Prince Kirtivarma, a younger brother of King Vikramaditya VI, wrote Govaidya ("Cattle Medicine"), the earliest available writing in Kannada on veterinary science, which mixes medicine and magic.|$|E
5|$|Peking opera {{features}} {{four main}} types of performers. Performing troupes often have several of each variety, {{as well as}} numerous secondary and tertiary performers. With their elaborate and colorful costumes, performers are the only focal points on Peking opera's characteristically sparse stage. They use the skills of speech, song, dance, and combat in movements that are symbolic and suggestive, rather than realistic. Above all else, the skill of performers is evaluated according to the beauty of their movements. Performers also adhere {{to a variety of}} stylistic conventions that help audiences navigate the plot of the production. The layers of meaning within each movement must be expressed in time with music. The music of Peking opera can be divided into the Xipi (西皮) and Erhuang (二黄) styles. Melodies include arias, fixed-tune melodies, and percussion patterns. The repertoire of Peking opera includes over 1,400 works, which are based on Chinese history, folklore, and, increasingly, <b>contemporary</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
5|$|The artist {{held her}} first solo show in Tunis in 2009, and {{subsequent}} solo shows in Berlin (2010), the Mosaic Rooms of Earl's Court (London, 2014), and the Dallas Contemporary (2015). Kaabi-Linke received the 2009 Alexandria Biennale's Jury Prize and the 2011 Abraaj Group Art Prize. The latter commissioned her 2011 Flying Carpets, which was {{shown at the}} 54th Venice Biennale and later purchased by and exhibited at the New York Guggenheim Museum in 2016. Kaabi-Linke held a residency at the London Delfina Foundation in 2012, where she was inspired after meeting survivors of domestic violence. She won the Discoveries Prize for emerging art at the 2014 Art Basel Hong Kong, where she exhibited with the Kolkatan Experimenter gallery. One of the judges juxtaposed the social content of her work against the political reservations of other exhibitions in the show. Earlier that year, she completed her Meinstein ("My Stone") project {{in the center of}} Neukölln, a borough of Berlin. Her pavement mosaic uses stones that correspond to the national origins of the borough's residents, which is a largely immigrant population. She described her practice, at that time, as an archaeology of <b>contemporary</b> <b>life.</b> As of 2016, Kaabi-Linke is represented by Lawrie Shabibi of Dubai and Experimenter of Kolkata.|$|E

25|$|Tuten spent 15 years {{heading the}} {{graduate}} program in creative {{writing at the}} City College of New York, which he co-founded. In that capacity, he championed the work of students Walter Mosley, Oscar Hijuelos, Philip Graham, Aurelie Sheehan, Salar Abdoh, Ernesto Quiñonez, and many others. He also teaches classes on experimental writing at The New School. He {{is on the board}} of advisors for Guernica Magazine and executive editor of Smyles & Fish. Tuten's short fiction has appeared in Granta, Conjunctions, Fence, Fiction, The New Review of Literature, Tri-Quarterly, and Harper's Magazine. In 1973, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Writing and in 2001 was given the Award for Distinguished Writing from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In describing his usage of the past in his novels (where many of them are set), Tuten once stated:The fact that I don’t write about <b>contemporary</b> <b>life</b> doesn’t mean I’m any less taken up with it. I find it too limiting to write about <b>contemporary</b> <b>life</b> just in contemporary diction, however. I don’t think there's enough flexibility. I can imagine writing about characters who feel passion for one another in a contemporary setting but I don’t, as yet, hear the language for that. But I’m always thinking about <b>contemporary</b> <b>life</b> vis a vis the way it looks in the past. I mean how it looks in the past is a reflection of what it is today. That's what interests me. I think I’m always talking about present-day life, not only political life but about the quality of passion, the quality of all relationships and love.|$|E

25|$|Initially, Urdu novels {{focused on}} urban social life, {{eventually}} widening in scope to include rural social life. They also covered the changing times under the progressive writing movement inspired by Sajjad Zaheer. However, {{the independence of}} Pakistan in 1947 greatly affected the novel, bringing up questions of identity and migration {{as can be seen}} in the major works of Abdullah Hussain and Quratulain Haider. Towards the end of the last century the novel took a serious turn towards the <b>contemporary</b> <b>life</b> and realities of the young generations of India. The most significant novels of the current generation of Indian novelists in Urdu, which demonstrate a new confidence in <b>contemporary</b> <b>life,</b> are Makaan by Paigham Afaqui, Do Gaz Zameen by Abdus Samad, and Pani by Ghazanfer. These works, especially Makaan, brought the Urdu novel out of the prevailing themes of the independence of Pakistan in 1947 and identity issues and took it into the realm of modern-day realities and issues of life in India. Makaan influenced many English writers such as Vikram Seth, who turned to novel writing. These Urdu novels further affected significant works such as Andhere Pag by Sarwat Khan, Numberdar Ka Neela by S M Ashraf and Fire Area by Ilyas Ahmed Gaddi. Paigham Afaqui's second major novel, Paleeta, was published in 2011 and depicts the tension of the political sickening of a common Indian citizen in the six decades after India's independence. Bewildered by the disappointing state of democracy and the transformation of Indian society into a mental desert the central character dies after leaving behind his writings which catch fire.|$|E
