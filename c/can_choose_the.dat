5|$|For team matches, bots {{are used}} to fill {{the roles of the}} player's teammates. The player <b>can</b> <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> bots' skill level or have it {{automatically}} adjust to the player's performance. Bots can be further customized by changing attributes such as names, appearance, and weapon preferences. In team matches, players can give orders to bots on their team. The PC version supports multiplayer mode over the internet or a local area network (the original Unreal was mainly a single-player game).|$|E

25|$|The Bohr–Mollerup theorem {{is useful}} {{because it is}} {{relatively}} easy to prove logarithmic convexity for any of the different formulas used to define the gamma function. Taking things further, instead of defining the gamma function by any particular formula, we <b>can</b> <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> conditions of the Bohr–Mollerup theorem as the definition, and then pick any formula we like that satisfies the conditions {{as a starting point for}} studying the gamma function. This approach was used by the Bourbaki group.|$|E

500|$|Most polymers, {{sometimes}} referred to as resins, may be used, including all thermoplastics, some thermosets, and some elastomers. Since 1995, the total number of available materials for injection moulding has increased at a rate of 750 per year; there were approximately 18,000 materials available when that trend began. [...] Available materials include alloys or blends of previously developed materials, so product designers <b>can</b> <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> material with the best set of properties from a vast selection. [...] Major criteria for selection of a material are the strength and function required for the final part, as well as the cost, but also each [...] material has different parameters for moulding that must be taken into account. Common polymers like epoxy and phenolic are examples of thermosetting plastics while nylon, polyethylene, and polystyrene are thermoplastic. Until comparatively recently, plastic springs were not possible, but advances in polymer properties make them now quite practical. Applications include buckles for anchoring and disconnecting the outdoor-equipment webbing.|$|E
500|$|Flexible {{and little}} binding, Antoinist beliefs {{are close to}} the {{contemporary}} belief, as followers <b>can</b> <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> beliefs they wish and interpret events as they want. The religion attaches great importance to freedom of conscience and free will, which renders it attractive and promotes a diversity of beliefs among the followers who can refer simultaneously to other religious traditions. Some believers see Antoine as an incarnation of God; others, who continue to practice Catholicism, consider him a prophet equal to Jesus Christ; others, who adhere to New Age doctrines, perceive him as a spiritual figure. The movement rejects indoctrination of children and prozelytism, even towards people who visit the temple, tolerates other religions as they teach the faith and prayer and thus detach people from the material world, and considers tolerance the highest virtue to practise. The religion does not provide any prescription on issues such as divorce, abortion and sexuality, has no political purpose and do not use honorary titles, considering all people equal. A periodical directed by writer Louis Pauwels summarized the main purposes of the religion as being the [...] "mutual aid, spiritual and human solidarity, availability and hospitality".|$|E
