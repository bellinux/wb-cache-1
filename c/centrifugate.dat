50|$|Producing {{membrane}} vesicles {{is one of}} {{the methods}} to investigate various membranes of the cell. After the living tissue is crushed into suspension, various membranes form tiny closed bubbles. Big fragments of the crushed cells can be discarded by low-speed centrifugation and later the fraction of the known origin (plasmalemma, tonoplast, etc.) can be isolated by precise high-speed centrifugation in the density gradient. Using osmotic shock, it is possible temporarily open vesicles (filling them with the required solution) and then <b>centrifugate</b> down again and resuspend in a different solution. Applying ionophores like valinomycin can create electrochemical gradients comparable to the gradients inside living cells.|$|E

Methods: This experimental study involved use of fifteen adult male New Zealand White rabbits. Each animal received a transverse lesion in the middle of the right tibialis anterior muscle, to which an absorbable collagen sponge, soaked in a <b>centrifugate</b> of bone marrow aspirate from the ipsilateral iliac bone, was added. The left hind limb was used as a control and underwent the same injury, but in this case only the absorbable collagen sponge. Thirty days later, the animals were sacrificed to study the muscle healing. These muscle areas were subjected to histological analysis with histomorphometry, with the aim of measuring the number of muscle cells per square micrometer undergoing regeneration and the proportion of resultant fibrosis. Results: The centrifugation method used in this study resulted in an average concentration of nucleated cells greater than the number of these cells in original aspirates, without causing significant cell destruction. Addition of the bone marrow <b>centrifugate</b> did not result in any significant increase in the number of muscle cells undergoing regeneration, in relation to the control group. There was also no significant difference in the proportion of resultant fibrosis, compared with the control group. Conclusion: Administration of the bone marrow <b>centrifugate</b> used in this study did not favor healing of muscle injuries in rabbits...|$|E

40|$|Summary. We have {{reported}} on the smooth and clean skin surface of the pilot whale Globicephala melas (Baum et al 2000 Aquatic Mammals 26 : 7). Smoothness and self-cleaning abilities of the skin surface {{are based on a}} gel that filles the nanoscalic inter-cellular space between the corneocytes. This gel {{is an important factor in}} the defence against adhesive glycoconjugates and organisms, that may negatively influence health and hydrodynamic demands of the dolphin. It was our aim to measure the rheological properties of the gel in order to confirm its viscoelastic behaviour predicted from our previous findings. Untreated fresh frozen skin samples of the pilot whale and <b>centrifugates</b> of mechani-cally ablated corneocytes were prepared for cryo-scanning electron microscopy (see Baum et al 2000 Aquatic Mammals 26 : 7). We examined the surface sculptures of the samples and documented different grades of polymerization seen in the <b>centrifugates.</b> Changes in viscoelasticity of the <b>centrifugates</b> were immediately after centrifugation monitored by means of a stress-controlled rheometer (Haake RS 150) with cone-and-plate geometry (35 mm, apex angle 1 °) under oszillatory shear conditions. When <b>centrifugates</b> polymerized, their surface morphology appeared similar to the sur-faces of the untreated fresh skin samples. The gelation kinetics measured confirm that the <b>centrifugates</b> underwent polymerization within 2. 5 - 3 hours after processing. At the beginning of the experiments, the high fluctuating pattern of the storage modul GŽ showed the presence of performed aggregates, which were destroyed by the oszillating force. After 2. 5 - 3 hours new aggregates built up a gel. We found that in vitro the gela-tion terminates in a duroplastic gel, indicating gelation based on covently cross-linked network bridges.

Secondly, two solutions were introduced into a round-bottom three-neck flask {{equipped with the}} condensator and magnetic stirring. Then, the mixture was heated to reflux. Gradually, the solution turned from colorless and transparent to white turbid. After the reaction was lasted for 12 h, the white turbid solution was <b>centrifugated</b> at 10, 000 rpm and washed with anhydrous ethanol several times. Finally, the white powders obtained were dried in an air atmosphere at 60 °C for 12 h.|$|R

To clarify the immuno-pathogenetical connections between the two syndromes, we studied the pattern of T helper cell (Th) 1 /Th 2 cytokine balance disturbances existing inside maternal decidua in normal pregnancy (NP) and pregnancies complicated with TH and PE. Methods: Third-trimester decidual tissue was obtained by curettage of uterine cavity during elective caesarean sections in NP (n = 11), TH (n = 17) and PE (n = 21) patients. Cell suspensions were prepared by an electromechanical dispersal method and <b>centrifugated</b> using a standard gradient sedimentation technique. Isolated lymphocytes were placed i...|$|R
5000|$|After the irradiation, {{the coating}} was {{dissolved}} with nitric acid and then precipitated as the hydroxide using concentrated aqueous ammonia solution. The product was <b>centrifugated</b> and re-dissolved in nitric acid. To separate berkelium from the unreacted americium, this solution {{was added to}} a mixture of ammonium and ammonium sulfate and heated to convert all the dissolved americium into the oxidation state +6. Unoxidized residual americium was precipitated {{by the addition of}} hydrofluoric acid as americium(III) fluoride (...) [...] This step yielded a mixture of the accompanying product curium and the expected element 97 in form of trifluorides. The mixture was converted to the corresponding hydroxides by treating it with potassium hydroxide, and after centrifugation, was dissolved in perchloric acid.|$|R
40|$|The {{motion of}} tiny heavy {{particles}} transported in a co-rotating vortex pair, {{with or without}} particle inertia and sedimentation, is investigated. The dynamics of non-inertial sedimenting particles is shown to be chaotic, under the combined effect of gravity and of the circular displacement of the vortices. This phenomenon is very sensitive to particle inertia, if any. By using nearly hamiltonian dynamical system theory for the particle motion equation written in the rotating reference frame, one can show that small inertia terms of the particle motion equation strongly modify the Melnikov function of the homoclinic trajectories and heteroclinic cycles of the unperturbed system, {{as soon as the}} particle response time is of the order of the settling time (Froude number of order unity). The critical Froude number above which chaotic motion vanishes and a regular centrifugation takes place is obtained from this Melnikov analysis and compared to numerical simulations. Particles with a finite inertia, {{and in the absence of}} gravity, are not necessarily <b>centrifugated</b> away from the vortex system. Indeed, these particles can have various equilibrium positions in the rotating reference frame, like the Lagrange points of celestial mechanics, according to whether their Stokes number is smaller or larger than some critical value. An analytical stability analysis reveals that two of these points are stable attracting points, so that permanent trapping can occur for inertial particles injected in an isolated co-rotating vortex pair. Particle trapping is observed to persist when viscosity, and therefore vortex coalescence, is taken into account. Numerical experiments at large but finite Reynolds number show that particles can indeed be trapped temporarily during vortex roll-up, and are eventually <b>centrifugated</b> away once vortex coalescence occurs.
