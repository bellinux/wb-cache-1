50|$|Early U.S. lamp {{manufacturers}} used {{different and}} incompatible bases. The Thomson-Houston Electric Company used a threaded stud {{at the bottom}} of the socket, and a flat contact ring. The Sawyer-Mann or Westinghouse base used a spring clip acting on grooves in the bulb base, and a <b>contact</b> <b>stud</b> {{at the bottom of}} the lamp. By about 1908, the Edison base was most common in the U.S., with the others falling out of use.|$|E

50|$|Electric {{railways}} with third rails, {{or fourth}} rails, in tunnels carry collector shoes projecting laterally (sideways), or vertically, from their bogies. The contact shoe may slide {{on top of}} the third rail (top running), on the bottom (bottom running) or on the side (side running). The side running contact shoe is used against the guide bars on rubber-tired metros. A vertical contact shoe is used on ground-level power supply systems, <b>stud</b> <b>contact</b> systems and fourth rail systems. A pair of contact shoes was used on underground current collection systems. The contact shoe on a <b>stud</b> <b>contact</b> system is called a ski collector. The ski collector moves vertically to accommodate slight variations in the height of the <b>studs.</b> <b>Contact</b> shoes may also be used on overhead conductor rails, on guide bars or on trolley wires. Most railways use three rails, while the London Underground uses four rails.|$|R
25|$|The <b>stud</b> <b>contact</b> system, as {{demonstrated}} with a dummy stud between the rails in the yard. This {{is the only}} known example of this form remaining, and is from Wolverhampton.|$|R
50|$|The {{predecessors}} of APS (known as <b>Stud</b> <b>contact</b> systems) {{were developed}} around 1900, {{and used by}} several tramway companies in Paris and in England. Associated with these systems were the inventors Dolter and Diatto.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Stud</b> <b>contact</b> is {{a system}} of {{electrification}} for model railways. It was popular before {{the widespread use of}} plastics since it permits the use of metal sleepers (ties) or track bases, and does not require an insulated section in each wheelset.|$|R
50|$|Wolverhampton District Company {{cars were}} {{modified}} with Lorain <b>Stud</b> <b>contact</b> system equipment and on 15 October 1906 began working between Dudley and Wolverhampton. This was discontinued in 1909 and only restarted in 1921 when the Wolverhampton Corporation Tramways were all converted to overhead power.|$|R
5000|$|A {{modernisation}} scheme followed immediately re-gauging to 3'6" [...] and electrification. The tramway {{was unique}} {{in using the}} Lorain <b>Stud</b> <b>contact</b> system, and because of this, connections to other networks in the area could not be made until 1921, when the council decided to convert to overhead wiring.|$|R
50|$|On 9 November 1905, {{the section}} between Stow Heath Lane and Bilston {{was taken over}} by Wolverhampton Corporation Tramways, and the Deans Road to Willenhall section on 18 April 1906. Wolverhampton Corporation Tramways cars were {{modified}} with overhead equipment to operate through journeys. Wolverhampton Corporation Tramways used the Lorain <b>Stud</b> <b>contact</b> system on the remainder of their routes.|$|R
50|$|The trams ran {{as far as}} Bexhill, {{and were}} worked by {{overhead}} electric wires, except for the stretch along the seafront from Bo-Peep to the Memorial, which was initially worked by the Dolter <b>Stud</b> <b>contact</b> system. The Dolter system was replaced by petrol electric trams in 1914, but overhead electrification was extended to this section in 1921.|$|R
50|$|The <b>stud</b> <b>contact</b> {{system is}} also used on model railway systems (e.g. Märklin) as the center line of studs is less {{obtrusive}} than a single central rail. For outdoor model railway systems {{the use of a}} stud supply system with a skate/ski collector has certain practical advantages. The system is inherently self-cleaning. While the track may not be perfect, with both rails acting as the return part of the system in parallel electrical pick up problems are substantially reduced.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>stud</b> <b>contact</b> {{system is}} a once-obsolete {{ground-level}} power supply system for electric trams. Power supply studs were set in the road at intervals and connected to a buried electric cable by switches operated by magnets on the tramcars. Current was collected from the studs by a [...] "skate" [...] or [...] "ski collector" [...] under the tramcar. The system was popular {{for a while in}} the early 1900s but soon fell out of favour because of the unreliability of the magnetic switches.|$|R
50|$|In {{some cities}} where {{overhead}} electric cables were deemed intrusive, underground conduits with electrical conductors were used. Examples of this were New York, Washington DC, Paris, London, Brussels and Budapest. The conduit system of electrical power was very expensive {{to install and}} maintain, although Washington did not close until 1962. Attempts were made with alternative systems not needing overhead wires. There were many systems of “surface” <b>contact,</b> where <b>studs</b> were set in the road surface, and energised by a passing tram, either mechanically or magnetically, to supply power through a skate carried under the tram. Unfortunately these systems all failed due {{to the problem of}} reliability and not always turning off after the tram had passed, resulting in the occasional electrocution of horses and dogs. In the last five years a new system of surface contact has been installed in the Bordeaux tramway by Alstom.|$|R
25|$|Hastings had {{a network}} of trams from 1905 to 1929. The trams ran as far as Bexhill, and were worked by {{overhead}} electric wires, except for the stretch along the seafront from Bo-Peep to the Memorial, which was initially worked by the Dolter <b>stud</b> <b>contact</b> system. The Dolter system was replaced by petrol electric trams in 1914, but overhead electrification was extended to this section in 1921. Trolleybuses rather than trams {{were used in the}} section that included the very narrow High Street, and the entire tram network was replaced by the Hastings trolleybus system in 1928–1929.|$|R
5000|$|Märklin uses a [...] "phantom" [...] third rail, {{where the}} middle rail is {{concealed}} in the track ballast or ties, with only studs protruding, giving {{the advantages of}} three-rail operation without seriously detracting from its realism. This is <b>stud</b> <b>contact</b> electrification for model railways and is often used on garden railway systems. Garden railways often have a mixture of electrical and real steam locomotives. while it is possible, insulating model steam locomotives to run on two rail electrification systems is problematic. In practice the stud system outdoors {{has been found to}} be more resistant to continuity problems caused by the outdoor environment.|$|R
2500|$|A {{horse was}} killed after it {{stepped on a}} live stud during {{construction}} of the tramway in Torquay. Each tram car was then fitted with a bell connected to a special contact arm to warn the driver if a stud remained live after it had passed. The conductor of the tram then had to reset the crank using an insulated mallet. During the Board of Trade inspection of the tramway four such studs were detected during about [...] of tests. There were also frequent problems with trams being stopped when a stud failed to be made live when needed. On 27 January 1910 a snow storm stopped all the trams as they couldn't make <b>contact</b> with the <b>studs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Märklin three-rail trains use a short spike of DC voltage {{to reverse}} a relay within the {{locomotive}} {{while it is}} stopped. Märklin's track {{does not have an}} actual third rail; instead, a series of short pins provide the current, taken up by a long [...] "shoe" [...] under the engine. This shoe is long enough to always be in contact with several pins. This is known as the <b>stud</b> <b>contact</b> system and has certain advantages when used on outdoor model railway systems. The ski collector rubs over the studs and thus inherently self cleans. When both track rails are used for the return in parallel there is much less chance of current interruption due to dirt on the line.|$|R
50|$|The tramway {{was one of}} {{very few}} in England {{operated}} with a Griffiths-Bedell <b>Stud</b> <b>contact</b> system in the roadway. This initial method of power provision survived until 1919 when this was replaced with overhead wires. The reason for the replacement was that gas leaked from the mains which {{found its way into}} the electric power cable conduit. This appeared in a startling and dangerous manner, as the gas ignitied by the arcing of the magnetic switches, with the result that the cast iron covers for the inspection boxes were blown off, and on more than one occasion, hurled into the air. To minimise the risk of explosion, and electric blower was installed at the Depot, and was started up every morning before the first car left the Depot, and this blew a current of air through the conduit, clearing it of any gas.|$|R
50|$|The <b>stud</b> <b>contact</b> {{system or}} surface contact system was used with some tramway systems. It is used {{especially}} where an overhead {{system would be}} obtrusive. As the studs would be on open roads rather than special track, methods have to be adopted {{to ensure that they}} are only live when under a vehicle. Early systems used mechanical switches. Most use magnetic activation from a magnet on the vehicle, but a few used a purely mechanical system. Systems in use {{in the early part of}} the 20th century included the Lorain, Dolter, and GB surface-contact systems, which were all magnetically operated, and the Robrow surface-contact system, which was mechanical. In practice the technology of the time could be erratic. This meant studs that that did not make contact when activated, and studs that remain live after the vehicle had passed over. Consequently the systems tended to be replaced with either overhead systems, or continuous contact sub surface systems.|$|R
50|$|The {{system was}} built by the National Electric Construction Company (NEC), which owned other systems in England, using the Dolter system of <b>stud</b> <b>contact</b> power supply (the reason given for this being the unsightliness of {{conventional}} overhead wiring) and public services began on Wednesday 6 February 1907 with a route linking College Square, Rotherham and Parkgate, this being extended to the company’s Dale Road depot in Rawmarsh three days later. The remainder of the line opened on 3 August. In the Dolter system the current was supplied from metal studs placed between the rails that became live and rose from the road to energize the motors of the tram passing over, being then supposed to become dead. This proved unsatisfactory since on occasions the studs remained upright and live so that horses following the tram hauling drays could receive an electric shock. In August 1908, following instructions from the Board of Trade, the company converted their system to overhead pick-up.|$|R
50|$|The {{town council}} of Torquay {{did not want}} their seaside resort {{disfigured}} by the poles and overhead wires of a conventional electric tramway and so invited the Dolter Electric Traction Company to construct a tramway using their stud-contact system. A horse was killed after it stepped on a live stud during construction of the Torquay Tramways. Each tram car was then fitted with a bell connected to a special contact arm to warn the driver if a stud remained live after it had passed. The conductor of the tram then had to reset the crank using an insulated mallet. During the Board of Trade inspection of the tramway four such studs were detected during about 8 mi of tests. There were also frequent problems with trams being stopped when a stud failed to be made live when needed. The network covered 6.79 mi and opened in stages during 1907 and 1908. On 27 January 1910 a snow storm stopped all the trams as they couldn't make <b>contact</b> with the <b>studs.</b> It was converted to overhead collection in 1911 shortly before it was extended to Paignton where the town council had refused to allow the Dolter system to be used.|$|R
40|$|Study {{on water}} contact {{activities}} and socio-cultural factors affecting {{the transmission of}} urinary schistosomiasis in rural community of Osun state was carried out. An endemic community located very close to Erinle dam was identified during general epidemiological survey of the state. Direct water contact observations and human water contact activities were made at Erinle dam near Ilie community. Also questionnaire {{was used for the}} study. Result showed that knowledge about the disease was very low. Only 500 (30. 30 %) respondents had knowledge of urinary schistomiasis by the local name “ATOSIAJA”. Water contact activity showed that most of the respondents 600 (36. 4 %) visited Erinle Dam for domestic purposes. Other purposes were recreation 300 (18. 2 %) and farming/fishing 100 (6. 1 %). Attitude and practices towards urinary schistosomiasis was very poor as regards the belief as a curable disease, a preventable disease and gravity of the disease. Also, in the area of personal hygiene, safety measures and treatment; those that believed in no remedy had the highest value of 546 (33. 1 %). The study on water contact activities either through direct observation or self reporting through questionnaires confirmed observational studies as more valid than interviews of reported water <b>contact</b> in the <b>stud...</b>|$|R
40|$|Creep {{degradation}} of steam carrying {{vessels in the}} power generation industry is a concern {{that needs to be}} constantly monitored. The Weldcore® process has been earmarked as a potential method of creep sampling which will allow for thick-walled sections to be analysed. A component of the process involves plugging the resultant hole after removing a creep sample using a novel welding technique called friction hydro pillar processing. At the commencement of this study, insufficient data was available to warrant safe industrial application of the process. This research was conducted to evaluate the performance of 10 CrMo 910 friction hydro pillar process welds. The effects of downward force, stud taper angle, hole taper angle and hole base diameter on process response, defect population, static properties and dynamic performance were evaluated. The variation of downward force showed that higher forces produce significantly smaller defects and higher fatigue life. The occurrence of defects was linked to process parameters and geometry thereby identifying the correct parameters for safe use in the power generation industry. Flash formation was identified as an early indicator of weld defects and can assist with quality control in industrial applications. Methods of standardising the plunge depth and forge force were developed to identify the correct magnitudes for different geometries, without the need for testing. Defects were shown to populate specific regions of the weld and produce variations in fatigue life. Crack initiation sites were detected which will aid in identifying areas of focus in further research and development. Temperature measurements were linked to the occurrence of defects and crack initiation sites and have been identified as a method of identifying defective welds. The effects of process parameters and stud and hole taper angles on energy inputs and near interface temperatures were statistically evaluated. Downward force was shown to have the largest effect on energy input rates, total energy input and temperatures at the 11. 5 mm and 20. 5 mm positions. Smaller hole and stud taper angles produced lower energy inputs and were identified as more energy efficient than the larger taper angles. A regression model was also developed to predict the fatigue life of welds and can assist with critical process related decision making. A range of hole base diameters were identified which produced welds with low defect populations and fatigue performance {{similar to that of the}} parent plate. Larger hole base diameters were shown to produce significant defects along the hole bottom fillet, in the weld nugget and along the bond line. Temperature measurements of the larger diameter welds showed a delay in response and are attributed to a delayed <b>contact</b> of plasticised <b>stud</b> material with the sidewall. Welds with hole base diameters larger than 11 mm produced unrepeatable and defective welds, and also required higher energy inputs making smaller diameters more desirable. Analysis of all welds in this study revealed that clearance and interfacial pressures characterise the quality of friction hydro pillar process welds, therefore models were developed to aid in critical decision making with respect to downward force and geometry. This study has successfully evaluated the effects of process parameters and geometry on the properties of friction hydro pillar process welds and thereby has increased understanding of the process...|$|R
