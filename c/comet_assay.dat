The mercury is extensively reported to accumulate in food chain and cause many neurological disorders in environment. The safety assessment of mercury on the ectodermal application on animal model is rarely reported. The void in the scientific study on external exposure of mercury and its genotoxic inside the body lead to the necessity for the present study. The freshwater cat fish Clarias batrachus was used for broad specificity genotoxic indicators micronucleus assay and alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (<b>comet)</b> <b>assays.</b> The fish was exposed to 0. 03 ppm of mercuric chloride {{for a period of}} 7, 14, 28 and 35 days ectodermally.

During pregnancy it is a further resource for reducing first-trimester pregnancy loss in women with the polycystic ovary syndrome. We tested metformin genotoxicity in cells of Chinese hamster ovary, CHO-K 1 (chromosome aberrations; <b>comet</b> <b>assays)</b> and in mice (micronucleus assays). Concentrations of 114. 4 �g/mL and 572 �g/mL were used in in vitro tests, and 95. 4 mg/kg, 190. 8 mg/kg and 333. 9 mg/kg in assaying. Although the in vitro tests revealed no chromosome aberrations in metaphase cells, DNA damage was detected by <b>comet</b> <b>assaying</b> after 24 h of incubation at both concentrations. The frequency of DNA damage was higher at concentrations of 114. 4 �g/mL. Furthermore, although mortality was not observed in in vitro tests, the highest dose of metformin suppressed bone marrow cells. However, no statistically significant differences were noted in micronuclei frequencies between treatments. In vitro results indicate that chronic metformin exposure may be potentially genotoxic. Thus, pregnant woman undergoing treatment with metformin should be properly evaluated beforehand, as regards vulnerability to DNA damage...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{cytotoxicity}} and genotoxicity of intravitreal adalimumab treatment in an animal experimental model using cytological and molecular techniques. Methods: Eighteen rabbits {{were randomly assigned}} to three groups: control, adalimumab treatment, and placebo. Cytotoxicity on retinal cells was evaluated using flow cytometry assays to determine the level of apoptosis and necrosis. Genotoxicity was evaluated by <b>comet</b> <b>assays</b> to assess DNA damage, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to evaluate expression of apoptosis-inducing caspases (8 and 3). Results: No cytotoxicity or genotoxicity was observed in any of the two treatment groups (adalimumab and placebo) following intravitreal administration compared with the control group. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that more than 90 % of the cells were viable, and only a low proportion of retinal cells presented apoptotic (~ 10 %) or necrotic (< 1 %) activity across all groups. Molecular damage was also low with a maximum of 6. 4 % DNA degradation observed in the <b>comet</b> <b>assays.</b> In addition, no increase in gene expression of apoptosis-inducing caspases was observed on retinal cells by qPCR in both the adalimumab and placebo groups compared with the control group. Conclusion: The use of adalimumab resulted in no detectable cytotoxicity or genotoxicity on retinal cells for up to 60 days upon administration. These results therefore indicate that adalimumab may be a safe option for intravitreal application to treat ocular inflammatory diseases in which TNF-&# 945; is involved...|$|R

BPF was not found to produce any genetic mutation when tested via an Ames test.

In addition, another study found BPF to be genotoxic when introduced to Hep G2 cells.|$|E
50|$|The <b>comet</b> <b>assay</b> is an {{extremely}} sensitive DNA damage assay. This sensitivity needs to be handled carefully as it is also vulnerable to physical changes which can affect the reproducibility of results. Essentially, anything that can cause DNA damage or denaturation except the factor(s) being researched is to be avoided. The {{most common form of}} the assay is the alkaline version although there is as yet no definitive alkaline assay protocol. Due to its simple and inexpensive setup, it can be used in conditions where more complex assays are not available.|$|E
50|$|To assay for {{genotoxic}} molecules, researchers assay for DNA {{damage in}} cells {{exposed to the}} toxic substrates. This DNA damage {{can be in the}} form of single- and double-strand breaks, loss of excision repair, cross-linking, alkali-labile sites, point mutations, and structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations. The compromised integrity of the genetic material has been known to cause cancer. As a consequence, many sophisticated techniques including Ames Assay, in vitro and in vivo Toxicology Tests, and <b>Comet</b> <b>Assay</b> have been developed to assess the chemicals' potential to cause DNA damage that may lead to cancer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Comet</b> <b>assays</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} common tests for genotoxicity. The {{technique}} involves lysing cells using detergents and salts. The DNA released from the lysed cell is electrophoresed in an agarose gel under neutral pH conditions. Cells containing DNA with an increased number of double-strand breaks will migrate more quickly to the anode. This technique is advantageous in that it detects low levels of DNA damage, requires only a very small number of cells, is cheaper than many techniques, is easy to execute, and quickly displays results. However, it does not identify the mechanism underlying the genotoxic effect or the exact chemical or chemical component causing the breaks.|$|R
40|$|Two COS {{mixtures}} and a {{low molecular}} weight chitosan (LMWC) were tested for potential cytotoxicity and genotoxicity upon human lymphocytes. Genotoxicity was evaluated in vitro by cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus and alkaline <b>comet</b> <b>assays,</b> while cytotoxicity was assessed by flow cytometry analysis. Our results suggest that COS do not exhibit any genotoxicity upon human lymphocytes, independently of MW or concentration. However, above 0. 07 mg/mL COS induced strong cytotoxic effects. According to the concentration used, such cytotoxicity will induce cell death, essentially by necrosis (> 0. 10 mg/mL) and/or apoptosis (< 0. 10 mg/mL). The level of necrosis/apoptosis induced by high COS concentrations, suggests a promising use as apoptosis inducers in specific cancer situations...|$|R

The exposure of the NPs correlated to a significant increase in micronuclei indicative of genetic fragmentation. Metal Oxides such as copper oxide, uraninite, and cobalt oxide have also been found to exert significant stress on exposed DNA. The damage done to the DNA will often result in mutated cells and colonies as found with the HPRT gene test.|$|E

It is sometimes stated [...] that alkaline conditions and complete denaturating of the DNA is necessary to detect single strand breaks. However this is not true, both single- and double strand breaks are also detected in neutral conditions. In alkaline conditions, however, additional DNA structures are detected as DNA damage: AP sites (abasic sites missing either a pyrimidine or purine nucleotide) and sites where excision repair is taking place.|$|E
40|$|Most {{commonly}} used anticancer drugs exert their effects mainly by causing DNA damage.

40|$|Background: Aldose reductase (AR) is a renal osmoresponsive {{gene that}} accu-mulates {{sorbitol}} to counteract hypertonicity-induced cellular damage. Loss of AR in the knockout mice (KO) {{led to the}} development of polydipsia and polyuria(Ho et al., 2000), although the mechanisms remained obscure. More recently, ithas been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo that the renal medullary cells areconstantly living with many DNA breaks as a result of exposure to hyperosmo-lality or concentrated urine (Dmitrieva et al., 2004). We therefore hypothesizedthat AR might offer osmoprotection to renal cells by protecting them from hyper-osmolality-induced DNA damage. Method: Genomic DNA integrity was evaluated in the kidneys of three groupsof mice by ﬂuorescent TUNEL assays as well as the <b>Comet</b> <b>assays</b> of renal primarycell culture. These mice included the wildtype (WT) and the KO mice and aline of bitransgenic mice (BT) that carry both the knockout mutation and atransgene that expresses AR collecting tubule epithelial cell (CTEC) -speciﬁcally. Results: TUNEL assays indicated that CTEC DNA breaks can be detected asearly as 3 weeks postnatal that were not seen in other types of renal cells. By the age of 5 weeks, signiﬁcantly more CTECs of the KO mice have DNA breaksthan that of the WT, indicating more severe DNA damage and/or apoptosis. Incontrast the BT mice almost have no DNA damage in the CTECs while the epithelial-speciﬁc AR expression largely but incompletely rescued the poy-dipsia and polyuria. Preliminary <b>Comet</b> <b>assays</b> on CTECs also suggested that AR deﬁcient cells are more susceptible to the hyperosmolality-induced DNAdamage. Conclusion: These data suggest that AR contributes to renal osmoprotection bypreventing hypertonicity-induced kidney DNA damage. Loss of this protectionin the KO mice very likely is one of the underlying mechanisms for the devel-opment of polyuira and polydipsia. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

It involves the encapsulation of cells in a low-melting-point agarose suspension, lysis of the cells in neutral or alkaline (pH>13) conditions, and electrophoresis of the suspended lysed cells.

50|$|The <b>comet</b> <b>assay</b> (single-cell gel electrophoresis) is {{a simple}} method for {{measuring}} deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) strand breaks in eukaryotic cells.

Electrophoresis at high pH results in structures resembling comets, observed by fluorescence microscopy; {{the intensity of the}} comet tail relative to the head reflects the number of DNA breaks. The likely basis for this is that loops containing a break lose their supercoiling and become free to extend toward the anode. This is followed by visual analysis with staining of DNA and calculating fluorescence {{to determine the extent of}} DNA damage. This can be performed by manual scoring or automatically by imaging software.|$|E

In another study, researcher tested the effects of differently sized platinum nanoparticles on primary human keratinocytes. The authors tested 5.8 and 57.0 nm Pt nanoparticles. The 57 nm nanoparticles had some hazardous effects including decreased cell metabolism, but the effect of the smaller nanoparticles was much more damaging. The 5.8 nm nanoparticles exhibited a more deleterious effect on the DNA stability of the primary keratincoytes than did the larger nanoparticles.

To determine whether the power of the <b>Comet</b> <b>assay</b> to detect a low level of genotoxic potential is superior to those of other genotoxicity assays in mammalian cells, we compared the results of <b>Comet</b> <b>assay</b> with those of micronucleus test (MN test). WTK 1 human lymphoblastoid cells were exposed to methyl nitrosourea (MNU), ethyl nitrosourea (ENU), methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), bleomycin (BLM), or UVC.

Furthermore, acellular <b>Comet</b> <b>assay</b> (acellular assay) was performed to determine how single-strand breaks (SSBs) as the initial damage contributes to DNA migration and/or to micronucleus formation. The lowest genotoxic dose (LGD), which is defined as the lowest dose at which each mutagen causes a positive response on each genotoxicity assay, was used to compare the power of the <b>Comet</b> <b>assay</b> to detect a low level of genotoxic potential and that of MN test; that is, a low LGD indicates a high power.
