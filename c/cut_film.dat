50|$|Weston {{mentioned}} he {{had just}} that morning written a letter to Ansel Adams, looking for someone seeking to learn photography in exchange for carrying his bulky large-format camera {{and to provide a}} much needed automobile. This was the era of heavy, wooden large format view cameras with their accompanying tripods, lenses, <b>cut</b> <b>film,</b> film holders, filters and cleansers—all toted around in the field. Dody had a thirst for photography, she had the strong body to carry equipment, and she had driven to Carmel in her own car. There was a swift meeting of creative minds. For the remainder of 1947 through the beginning of 1948, Dody commuted from San Francisco on weekends to learn from Weston the basics of photography.|$|E

50|$|Although Associated-Rediffusion {{retained}} {{a number of}} rights, including approval of episode synopses, script approval, music approval, and viewing rights for the rushes and final <b>cut,</b> <b>film</b> scholars Jean-Pierre Berthomé and Francois Thomas argue that Welles remained in control much of the time, due to the fragmentary, piecemeal way in which much of the footage was shot, with the writer/director/presenter being {{the only person who}} could piece it all together. For instance, Welles shot most of his interviews with only one camera, focussed on the interviewee, and all of the reverse shots of him asking questions had to be shot later in a studio. Frequently, Welles's entire episodes would be heavily studio-dependent; his entire participation in an episode on bullfighting consisted of filming himself entering and sitting down at a bullfight, then filming the bullfight; and the reconstructing part of the audience seats in a studio, so he could record his bullfight commentary months after having watched it.|$|E
