This option has been investigated here to recover the heat available from {{three of the four}} engines of a real electrically driven Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) carrier, having an electric power output of 23, 375 kW. A detailed analysis of the engines operation was first performed to create a reliable set of thermodynamic parameters that fulfil the energy balance of the engines. Heat associated with the jacket water, lubricating oil and <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> of the engines has been considered to be available for the ORC, while the heat from the exhaust gases is already exploited to generate low pressure steam for ship internal use. Simple, regenerative and two-stage ORC configurations have been compared using six different organic fluids that were selected as the most suitable for this application. The thermal matching that maximizes the net power output of the total system including engine cooling circuits and ORC cycle is found by applying the Heatsep method, which allows the optimum heat transfer between thermal streams to be evaluated independently of the structure/number of the heat exchangers within the system. Three layouts of the cooling systems collecting the heat available from the engines have been compared. Results show that the maximum net power output (820 kW) that is achievable by the two-stage configuration almost doubles the simple cycle and regenerative ones (430 - 580 kW).

40|$|An {{expedient}} {{route to}} improving in-vehicle fuel economy in 4 -stroke cycle engines {{is to reduce}} the swept volume of an engine and run it at a higher BMEP for any given output. The full-load performance of a larger capacity engine can be achieved through pressure charging. However, for maximum fuel economy, particularly at part-load, the expansion ratio, and consequently the compression ratio (CR) should be kept as high as possible. This is at odds with the requirement in pressure-charged gasoline engines to reduce the CR at higher loads due to the knock limit. In earlier work, the authors studied a pressure-charging system aimed at allowing a high CR to be maintained at all times. The operation of this type of system involves deliberately over-compressing the <b>charge</b> <b>air,</b> <b>cooling</b> it at the elevated pressure and temperature, and then expanding it down to the desired plenum pressure, ensuring a plenum temperature which can potentially become sub-atmospheric at full-load. Due to the ability to support a high fixed CR, it is possible that an engine fitted with such a charging system could achieve fuel economy equal to or better than a Variable Compression Ratio unit, while permitting conventional engine architecture and assembly lines. The concept has been termed "Turboexpansion". This paper analyses some initial test bed results taken from an engine fitted with such a charging system, and discusses future development work intended to establish further the validity of the concept and hence its feasibility as a tool to facilitate aggressive engine downsizing. Additional theoretical analysis is presented which indicates constraints on the effectiveness of the system in terms of its sensitivity to the separate component efficiencies...|$|R

50|$|Present-day <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> systems, {{based on}} {{aluminium}} alloys, experience durability problems at temperatures and pressures necessary {{to meet the}} U.S. Tier 4i standards for stationary and mobile engines. Published reports estimate that the average life of an aluminium <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> is currently only about 3,500 hours. Aluminium is near its upper technological limit to accommodate higher temperatures and thermal stress levels because the tensile strength of the metal declines rapidly at 150°C and repetitive thermal cycling between 150°C and 200°C substantially weakens it. Thermal cycling creates weak spots in aluminium tubes, which in turn causes charge air coolers to fail prematurely. A potential option is to install stainless steel precoolers in aluminium charge air coolers, but limited space and the complexity of this solution is a hampering factor for this option.|$|E

40|$|Increasing engine {{performance}} requirements and demanding markets pose challenges for engine manufacturers, {{which has led}} to more complex control systems. Engine control software development is expensive and time consuming process especially in marine industry. Engine modeling and rapid prototyping are proposed to shorten control system development cycles. Model in the loop simulation can be used to test control system functionality. For this purpose, a zero dimensional mean value engine model is parameterized for a Wärtsilä 6 cylinder medium speed four stroke dual fuel engine. Before parameterization, dual fuel engine operating cycle and combustion process are reviewed in order to model the processes based on physical phenomena. The Combustion Model is the most complex of all the modeled systems. Other systems of the mean value engine model are Engine Model that covers air flow through the engine, Gas System that models fuel gas admission, Fuel System that is in charge of diesel fuel injection, Lube Oil System that simulates heat transfer to lubricating oil and Cooling Water Circuit that handles engine and <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooling.</b> These systems are modeled to a varying degree of accuracy. The equations used to model the components of each system are presented. Instrument and start air systems of the engine are not modeled. The engine model is made with Matlab/Simulink. In order to test the control system against the model and ensure their compatibility, control inputs used to influence the plant model and measurement outputs for control system feedback are processed. Test run on the actual engine is made to collect reference data of the engine’s performance. Measured data is used to parameterize the engine model via simulation on development computer. The model is then discretized for real time simulation. During real time simulation on target computer, engine controllers are parameterized to get realistic response. Engine model accuracy is validated by comparing steady-state performance and transient response of the model against measured engine data. Analysis of the results confirms that engine model accuracy is sufficient for control system functionality testing. However, the accuracy is not enough for control system calibration. Due to adequate accuracy, realistic cause and effect relationships between different engine systems and real time simulation capabilities, the engine model can be used for rapid prototyping based control system development...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{shipping}} industry has faced {{an increasing number}} of challenges in terms of fluctuating fuel prices, stricter environmental regulations, and concerns about global warming. In this situation, passenger volumes on cruise ships have increased from around 4 million to 13 million from 1990 to 2008 and keep growing today. A small cruise ship can emit about 85 tons of CO 2 per day, and require around 27 tons of fuel per day. To keep up with market demand, while reducing their impact on the environment, cruise ships will need to improve their energy efficiency. Most previous research in marine technology relates to energy efficiency focused on propulsion, which for most ship types constitutes the largest energy demand. On cruise ships, however, auxiliary heat and electric power also have a significant importance. For this reason, we focus in this paper on the heat demand and its integration with available sources of waste heat on board. In this study, the principles of process integration are applied to the energy system of a cruise ship operating in the Baltic Sea. The heat sources (waste heat from the main and auxiliary engines in form of exhaust gas, cylinder <b>cooling,</b> <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooling,</b> and lubricating oil cooling) and sinks (HVAC, hot water, fuel heating) are evaluated based on one year of operational data and used to generate four operating conditions that best represent ship operations. Applying the pinch analysis to the system revealed that the theoretical potential for heat integration on board could potentially allow the reduction of the external heat demand by between 35 % and 85 % depending on the investigated case. A technoeconomic optimisation allowed the identification of the most economically viable heat exchanger network designs: two in the “retrofit” scenario and one in the “design” scenario, with a reduction of 13 - 33 %, 15 - 27 % and 46 - 56 % of the external heat demand, respectively. Given the high amount of heat being available after the process integration, we also analysed the potential for the installation of a steam turbine for the recovery of the energy available in the exhaust gas, which resulted in up to 900 kW of power being available for on board electric power demand...|$|R
40|$|A modern {{diesel engine}} {{is capable of}} running {{efficiently}} with low exhaust gas emissions over a wide operating range. This is thanks to techniques such as turbocharging, EGR, <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> and an advanced fuel injection process. The fuel injection process {{is important for the}} combustion and emission formation in the diesel engine. The fuel injector has to atomize and vaporize the fuel as it is injected. During the combustion the emission formation has to be kept to a minimum. Very strong pressure gradients are present in a modern diesel injection nozzle, this causes cavitation to occur in the nozzle holes. The influence of cavitation on flow parameters such as the various discharge coefficients is discussed. The occurrence of cavitation helps the spray break up and it can keep the nozzle holes free from deposits. Excessive amounts of cavitation can lead to hole erosion and thus impact the long term operation of the nozzle in a negative way. Hole erosion as well as other mechanisms can cause hole to hole variations in fuel spray impulse, mass flow, penetration etc. This is a very important issue in any low emission diesel engine, especially during transients, as less than optimal conditions have to be handled. The influence of hole to hole variation on fuel consumption and emissions is not very well known and this thesis contributes to the field. As a part of this work a fuel spray momentum measurement device was developed and tested. Any automotive engine {{needs to be able to}} perform quick transitions between different loads and speeds, so called transients. In a turbocharged diesel engine with EGR issues related to the turbocharger and the EGR-circuit arise. A diesel engine has to run with a certain air excess in order to achieve complete combustion with low emissions of soot. When turbocharging is used the turbocharger turbine uses some of the exhaust enthalpy to drive the turbo compressor, in this way the engine is provided with boost pressure. In order for the engine and turbocharger to function at the higher load and thus higher mass flow rate the turbocharger has to increase its rotational speed and the surface temperatures have to settle at a new thermodynamic state. Both of these processes take time and during this time the combustion process may have to proceed under less than optimum circumstances due to the low boost pressure...|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} use, however, is {{probably}} in vehicles. It {{is used in}} door seals, window seals, trunk seals, and sometimes hood seals. Frequently, these seals {{are the source of}} noise due to movement of the door against the car body and the resulting friction between the EPDM rubber and the mating surface (painted sheet metal or glass). This can be alleviated using specialty coatings that are applied at the time of manufacture of the weather seal. Such coatings can also greatly increase the chemical resistance of EPDM rubber. Some vehicle manufacturers also recommend a light application of silicone dielectric grease to weatherstripping to reduce noise. Other uses in vehicles include cooling system circuit hoses where water pumps, thermostats, EGR valves, EGR coolers, heaters, oil coolers, radiators, and degas bottles are connected with EPDM hoses, as well as charge air tubing on turbocharged engines to connect the cold side of the <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> (intercooler) to the intake manifold.|$|E
