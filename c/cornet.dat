5|$|Fifth-placed Henri <b>Cornet,</b> aged 19, {{then became}} the {{youngest}} ever winner of the Tour. <b>Cornet</b> had also been warned after he had received a lift by a car. Only 15 cyclists from the original 27 that finished were not disqualified.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} stage, {{the first major}} climb, the Ballon d'Alsace, made its debut. Four riders were the fastest climbers: Trousselier, René Pottier, <b>Cornet</b> and Aucouturier. Of those four, Trousselier and Aucouturier {{were the first to}} be dropped, and <b>Cornet</b> had to drop in the final kilometers. The top was {{therefore}} reached first by René Pottier, without dismounting, at an average speed of 20km/h. <b>Cornet,</b> who reached the top second, had to wait 20 minutes for his bicycle with higher gear, because his support car had broken down.|$|E

5|$|A distant, mournful fanfare (A), {{played on}} a <b>cornet</b> {{representing}} a bugle, {{is followed by a}} brisk military march initiated by a duet for side drum and piccolo (B). A passage for brass precedes the introduction of a theme or leitmotif associated with the phantom Kijé which, after a reprise of the march and a C major crescendo, is repeated on tenor saxophone, an instrument relatively new to the orchestra at that time. The <b>cornet</b> fanfare then returns to close the movement.|$|E

5|$|In {{the third}} stage, the Tour reached Nîmes, near the {{home town of}} Payan, whose fans were angry because of his disqualification. They threw rocks at the riders, and barricaded the road. The cyclists had {{troubles}} passing through Nîmes, and several were injured. The most important event for the general classification was when César Garin's bicycle was broken by attackers; {{he had to find}} a new bicycle, which took him 15 minutes. Further on, nails and broken glass were spread along the road. Many riders punctured, but there were no serious falls. The cyclists passed this part walking. After Nîmes, a leading group of five cyclists was formed: Maurice Garin, Pothier, Aucouturier, <b>Cornet</b> and Beaugendre. Aucouturier and <b>Cornet</b> escaped, and Aucouturier won, beating <b>Cornet</b> in the sprint.|$|E

5|$|After the {{engagement}} at Le <b>Cornet</b> Malo, C Company and HQ Company of the 2nd Royal Norfolks had fallen {{back to their}} headquarters at <b>Cornet</b> Farm, just outside Le Paradis. The company commanders had been informed by radio that their units were isolated and would receive no assistance. They therefore dug in around the farmhouse, which lay on the Rue du Paradis, {{the boundary between the}} Royal Norfolk Regiment and the adjacent 1st Royal Scots. The Norfolks' last contact with Brigade Headquarters at L'Epinette was at 11:30 but despite no support and heavy opposition, the defenders held out against the 14th Company, 1st Battalion of the 2nd SS Infantry Regiment until 17:15, when they ran out of ammunition. During the battle the Germans attacked the farmhouse with mortars, tanks and artillery shelling, which destroyed the building and forced the defenders to relocate to a cowshed. SS-Standartenführer Hans Friedemann Götze, commander of the Totenkopf Division's third regiment, was killed in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the scandals}} {{associated}} with this Tour, Desgrange wanted to stop the race. He however changed his mind, and the rules were changed to prevent cyclists from cheating: the 1905 Tour de France would be decided with a points system. Tour de France 1904 winner <b>Cornet</b> would enter the Tour de France for seven more times, but would never again play an important role.|$|E

5|$|The {{movement}} {{begins with}} and is regularly visited by a broad, ceremonial and somewhat pompous melody (D), played on brass and woodwind. In between these formal-sounding statements are a cheerful <b>cornet</b> solo and various elaborations and {{variations on the}} Kijé theme, which together give the movement a celebratory feel, both boisterous and sentimental.|$|E
5|$|Antoni Gaudi {{was born}} in 1852 in Riudoms or Reus, to the {{coppersmith}} Francesc Gaudí i Serra (1813–1906) and Antònia <b>Cornet</b> i Bertran (1819–1876). He {{was the youngest of}} five children, of whom three survived to adulthood: Rosa (1844–1879), Francesc (1851–1876) and Antoni. Gaudí's family originated in the Auvergne region in southern France. One of his ancestors, Joan Gaudí, a hawker, moved to Catalonia in the 17th century; possible origins of Gaudí's family name include Gaudy or Gaudin.|$|E
5|$|Art Farmer {{was born}} {{an hour before}} his twin brother, on August 21, 1928, in Council Bluffs, Iowa, {{reportedly}} at 2201 Fourth Avenue. Their parents, James Arthur Farmer and Hazel Stewart Farmer, divorced when the boys were four, and their steelworker father {{was killed in a}} work accident not long after this. Art moved with his grandfather, grandmother, mother, brother and sister to Phoenix, Arizona when he was still four. He started to play the piano while in elementary school, then moved on to bass tuba and violin before settling on <b>cornet</b> and then trumpet at the age of thirteen. His family was musical: most of them played as a hobby, and one was a professional trombonist. Art's grandfather was a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. This influenced Farmer's first choice of instrument, as his mother played piano for the church choir. The bass tuba was for use in a marching band and was Farmer's instrument for a year, until a <b>cornet</b> became available. Phoenix schools were segregated, and no one at Farmer's school could provide useful music lessons. He taught himself to read music and practiced his new main instrument, the trumpet.|$|E
