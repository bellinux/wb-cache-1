A study completed in January 1998 provided <b>cost-benefit</b> analysis and preliminary costs and recommended eight sites for further study. Based on this, Congressman John W. Olver obtained $8.615 million in federal earmarks to fund the project; the state provided the 20% local match to reach the full $11 million cost.|$|E

25|$|<b>Cost–benefit</b> {{analysis}} {{is often used}} by organizations to appraise the desirability of a given policy. It is {{an analysis of the}} expected balance of benefits and costs, including an account of foregone alternatives and the status quo. CBA helps predict whether the benefits of a policy outweigh its costs, and by how much relative to other alternatives, so that one can rank alternate policies in terms of the <b>cost–benefit</b> ratio. Generally, accurate <b>cost–benefit</b> analysis identifies choices that increase welfare from a utilitarian perspective. Assuming an accurate CBA, changing the status quo by implementing the alternative with the lowest <b>cost–benefit</b> ratio can improve Pareto efficiency. While CBA can offer a well-educated estimate of the best alternative – perfect appraisal of all present and future costs and benefits is difficult –, perfection in terms of economic efficiency and social welfare are not guaranteed.|$|E

However, adoption of cloud computing platforms and services by {{the scientific community}} is in its infancy as the performance and monetary <b>cost-benefits</b> for scien-tific applications are not perfectly clear.

We compare and contrast the performance and mon-etary <b>cost-benefits</b> of clouds for desktop grid applications, ranging in computational size and storage. We address the following questions: (i) What are the performance trade-offs in using one platform over the other? (ii) What are the specific resource requirements and monetary costs of cre-ating and deploying applications on each platform? (iii) In light of those monetary and performance <b>cost-benefits,</b> how do these platforms compare? (iv) Can cloud comput-ing platforms be used in combination with desktop grids to improve cost-effectiveness even further? We examine those questions using performance measurements and monetary expenses of real desktop grids and the Amazon elastic com-pute cloud. ...|$|R
40|$|Regression {{testing is}} an {{expensive}} activity that can account for {{a large proportion of}} the software maintenance budget. Because engineers add tests into test suites as software evolves, over time, increased test suite size makes revalidation of the software more expensive. Regression test selection, test suite reduction, and test case prioritization techniques can help with this, by reducing the number of regression tests that must be run and by helping testers meet testing objectives more quickly. These techniques, however, can be expensive to employ and may not reduce overall regression testing costs. Thus, practitioners and researchers could benefit from cost models that would help them assess the <b>cost-benefits</b> of techniques. Cost models have been proposed for this purpose, but some of these models omit important factors, and others cannot truly evaluate costeffectiveness. In this paper, we present new <b>cost-benefits</b> models for regression test selection, test suite reduction, and test case prioritization, that capture previously omitted factors, and support <b>cost-benefits</b> analyses where they were not supported before. We present the results of an empirical study assessing these models...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This {{study is}} a <b>cost-benefits</b> {{analysis}} of {{the recommendations of the}} Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for presumptive anti-malarial treatment among departing West African refugees. We conducted a retro-spective chart review of symptomatic, blood smear–positive cases of malaria seen in Minneapolis, Minnesota, from 1996 through 2005. Billing charges of U. S. care were compared with estimates of implementation costs for overseas treatment. Fifty-eight symptomatic malaria infections occurred among West African refugees. After overseas pre-departure pre-sumptive treatment, symptomatic malaria in arriving refugees decreased from 8. 2 % to 0 %. The pre-departure number needed to treat to prevent one case of symptomatic malaria is 13. 9 (95 % confidence interval 9. 8 – 24). The average U. S. billing charge for each malaria case is $ 1, 730. Overseas implementation costs for presumptive treatment are estimated to be between $ 141 and $ 346 to prevent one U. S. malaria case. Overseas presumptive pre-departure anti-malarial therapy prevents clinical malaria in refugees and results in <b>cost-benefits</b> when the malaria prevalence is> 1 %. Overseas presumptive therapy has greater <b>cost-benefits</b> than U. S. based screening and treatment strategies...|$|R

25|$|Herd {{immunity}} {{is often}} accounted for when conducting <b>cost–benefit</b> analyses of vaccination programs. It {{is regarded as}} a positive externality of high levels of immunity, producing an additional benefit of disease reduction that would not occur had no herd immunity been generated in the population. Therefore, herd immunity's inclusion in <b>cost–benefit</b> analyses results in more favorable cost-effectiveness or <b>cost–benefit</b> ratios and {{an increase in the number}} of disease cases averted by vaccination. Study designs done to estimate herd immunity's benefit include recording disease incidence in households in which a member was vaccinated, randomizing a population in a single geographic area to be vaccinated or not, and observing disease incidence before and after a vaccination program is introduced. From these, it can be observed that disease incidence may decrease to a level beyond what can be predicted from direct protection alone, indicating that herd immunity contributed to the reduction. When serotype replacement is accounted for, it lessens the predicted benefits of vaccination.|$|E
