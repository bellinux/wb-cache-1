They hear music <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>inside</b> it. Shots are fired from inside the boat through the boat hatch entrance. After {{breaking}} the hatch open, they find a drunken Desmond piloting the boat. The next day, after Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) prevents Locke from destroying the computer that controls the timer, Locke enlists Desmond's help in letting the timer run down to zero. Desmond hotwires the blast doors shut, locking Eko outside the computer room and Desmond and Locke inside of it. Eko, distraught, seeks Charlie Pace's (Dominic Monaghan) help. The two attempt to use dynamite to blow the blast door open, but the blast doors are unscathed, while they are both injured.|$|E

When asked about the lyrical content of the record, Mars stated that [...] " [...] just [...] songs that [...] strongly believe in and that are <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>inside.</b> There's no tricks. It's honesty with big melodies. And [...] singing the s*** out of them." [...] During an interview, Mars explained that after writing and producing songs for other artists, he thought that he could write a song for himself. He started writing the lyrics of [...] "Talking To The Moon" [...] while playing the piano. The track was included five months later on his debut studio album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, released on October 4, 2010 under the Elektra and Atlantic labels. Mars also recorded an acoustic piano version included on the deluxe edition of the album.

500|$|It's Better If You Don't Understand is {{composed}} of four songs employing pop, pop rock, and hip hop genres. Mars explained that the EP is hard to classify since: [...] "I just write songs that I strongly believe in and that are <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>inside.</b> There's no tricks. It's honesty with big melodies. And I'm singing the s*** out of them". Labeled as a [...] "romantic croon", the opening track, [...] "Somewhere in Brooklyn", was composed by The Smeezingtons. It features [...] "an emo-pop backing" [...] beat, a piano and synthesizers. Lyrically, the tune is about Mars chasing the [...] "perfect woman" [...] who got away, and wishing to find her again. The second release, [...] "The Other Side", features a vocal collaboration with Cee Lo Green and B.o.B., and is considered the best on the EP by some critics. The track {{has been described as}} incorporating 60's and 70's soulful feeling. Its instrumentation uses guitar, organ and a: [...] "drum and bass pace that slowly builds through the verse and into the chorus". It is reminiscent of compositions by Daniel Merriweather and Chris Isaak’s [...] "Wicked Game". [...] "The Other Side" [...] shows Mars' darker side has a [...] "soaring pop" [...] hook.|$|E

2500|$|A key defense {{forensic}} witness was Alexander Jason, a {{crime scene}} analyst and ballistics expert who disproved several of the prosecution's main points relating to the physical evidence. Among them was {{the timing of the}} incident. After performing tests with an NYPD pistol, Jason demonstrated that the 31 shots fired by one detective (Oliver) could have been done in about 12 seconds [...] not several minutes. Using high speed video during ballistic testing, Jason demonstrated that bullets fired through a car window would project glass {{both inside and outside the}} car and that this could be interpreted as shots <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>inside.</b> Another of Jason's key points (mentioned in Judge Cooperman's written verdict) was that the person in the back seat of Bell's car (Benefield) was not shot while he was running away as he claimed, but while inside the car.

At the programme's beginning, {{nothing at all}} is known of the Doctor: not even his name, the actual form of which remains a mystery. In the first serial, An Unearthly Child, two teachers from Coal Hill School in London, Barbara Wright and Ian Chesterton, become intrigued by one of their pupils, Susan Foreman, who exhibits high intelligence and unusually advanced knowledge. Trailing her to a junk yard at 76 Totter's Lane, they encounter a strange old man and hear Susan's voice <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>inside</b> {{what appears to be}} a police box. Pushing their way inside, the two find that the exterior is camouflage for the dimensionally transcendental interior of the TARDIS. The old man, whom Susan calls [...] "Grandfather", kidnaps Barbara and Ian to prevent them from telling anyone about the existence of the TARDIS, taking them on an adventure in time and space. The first Doctor, says cultural scholar John Paul Green, [...] "explicitly positioned the Doctor as grandfather to his companion Susan."

Louis Garrison, owner of the farm that {{included}} the Bell Witch Cave, heard unexplained noises <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>inside.</b> Bell descendants described the sound of something rubbing against a house, a paper like object that flew out the door and reentered through a side door, and faint music heard from a piano. A group from the local Epworth League were reported to have attended a wiener roast in a rock quarry near the Bell Witch Cave on July 29, 1937. The group were joking about the legend when they saw a figure of a woman sitting on top of the cliff over the cave causing many to flee. According to the newspaper, a minister in the group later claimed to have investigated and discovered it was moon light on a rock. The second report concluded with a weather report that the moon was barely noticeable that night.

We perform a detailed {{calculation of the}} neutrino spectra <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> Dark Matter annihilations inside the Sun and the Earth, taking into account all the possible processes that could occur during propagation: oscillation and interaction with matter. We examine in a systematic way the possibilities of Dark Matter annihilation directly into neutrinos, considering the case of scalar and fermionic Dark Matter. We explicitly calculate the annihilation cross section for different typologies of diagrams. We identify the most favourable scenarios, for which the behaviour of the cross section is given. We then describe the phenomenology of the leptophilic Dark Matter and show how experimental bounds on the neutrino flux <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> annihilations <b>inside</b> the Sun disfavour this model as explanation of the DAMA results. Finally, a carefull analysis of the neutrino flux expected <b>from</b> neutralino annihilations <b>inside</b> the Sun and the Earth is presented.
