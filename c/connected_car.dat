40|$|AbstractThe {{wireless}} communication technologies built-in or {{brought in the}} vehicle enable new in-car telematics services. The development of <b>connected</b> <b>cars</b> emphasizes the use of sophisticated computation framework for gathering, analyzing a large volume of data generated {{in all aspects of}} vehicle operations using Big Data technologies. Since these data are essential for many <b>connected</b> <b>cars</b> applications, the design and monitoring of MapReduce algorithms for processing vehicle's data using Hadoop framework will allow to build a hosting of analytics data source. This hosting data source allows different <b>connected</b> <b>cars</b> industry ecosystem to access useful data they need to afford <b>connected</b> <b>cars</b> applications. This paper studies design steps to take in consideration when implementing MapReduce patterns to analyze vehicle's data in order to produce accurate useful data that are hosted at the automakers and <b>connect</b> <b>cars</b> services providers. Experiment results show that MapReduce join algorithm is highly scalable and optimized for distributed computing than Statistical Analysis System (SAS) framework and HiveQL declarative language...|$|R

40|$|Upcoming {{disruptive}} technologies around {{autonomous driving}} of <b>connected</b> <b>cars</b> {{have not yet}} been matched with appropriate security by design principles and lack approaches to incorporate proactive preventative measures in the wake of increased cyber-threats against such systems. In this paper, we introduce proactive anomaly detection to a use-case of hijacked <b>connected</b> <b>cars</b> to improve cyber-resilience. Firstly, we manifest the opportunity of behavioural profiling for <b>connected</b> <b>cars</b> from recent literature covering related underpinning technologies. Then, we design and utilise a new dataset file for <b>connected</b> <b>cars</b> influenced by the Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS–B) surveillance technology used in the aerospace industry to facilitate data collection and sharing. Finally, we simulate the analysis of travel routes in real-time to predict anomalies using predictive modelling. Simulations show the applicability of a Bayesian estimation technique, namely Kalman Filter. With the analysis of future state predictions based on the previous behaviour, cyber-threats can be addressed with a vastly increased time-window for a reaction when encountering anomalies. We discuss that detecting real-time deviations for malicious intent with predictive profiling and behavioural algorithms can be superior in effectiveness than the retrospective comparison of known-good/known-bad behaviour. When quicker action can be taken while <b>connected</b> <b>cars</b> encounter cyber-attacks, more effective engagement or interception of command and control will be achieved...|$|R
