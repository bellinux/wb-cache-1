It is also equal to the net amount of A's currency traded in the foreign exchange market over that time period. The value of exports (bananas, ice cream, clothing) produced in country A is always matched by the value of reciprocal payments of some asset (cash, stocks, real estate) made by buyers in other countries to the producers in country A. This value is also equal to the total amount of A's currency traded in the foreign exchange market over that year, because essentially the buyers in other countries trade in their assets (e.g. foreign currency) to convert to equivalent <b>amount</b> in A's <b>currency,</b> <b>and</b> use this <b>amount</b> to pay for A's export products.|$|R

This is a {{rationale}} covering certain recommendations I’ve {{made about the}} design of an international standard for the exchange of legislative documents during my presentation, Legislative-XHTML – Integrating ECMA Script & RDF, to the V Legislative XML Workshop. This paper focuses on the scope of data models needed for open and de-centralized legislative document annotation. These data models are used when naming text words, phrases, <b>and</b> numeric <b>and</b> <b>currency</b> <b>amounts</b> in a document. Automated extraction of this information – the ultimate aim of legislative document exchange – is argued to be best accomplished using a document exchange standard that is built upon the Resource Description Framework (RDF) rather than XML Schema. Electing RDF implies strongly that annotating XHTML, Version 2. 0 documents is the proper medium for standardized exchange...|$|R

Typically, one cannot find NSW's in a dictionary, nor can one find their pronunciation by {{an application of}} ordinary "letterto -sound" rules. Non-standard words also have a greater propensity than ordinary words to be ambiguous {{with respect to their}} interpretation or pronunciation. In many applications, it is desirable to :'normalize" text by replacing the NSW's with the contextually appropriate ordinary word or sequence of words. Typical technology for text normalization involves sets of ad hoc rules tuned to handle one or two genres of text (often newspaper-style text) with the expected result that the techniques do not usually generalize well to new domains. The purpose of the work reported here is to take some initial steps towards addressing deficiencies in previous approaches to text normalization...|$|R

The mix of currencies is also found to be influenced by interest rate differentials, with greater issuance in higher-yielding <b>currencies,</b> <b>and</b> by the <b>amount</b> of home country issuance. Taken together, the results suggest that both the investor’s and the issuer’s preferences determine currency choice in international bond issuance. JEL classification: G 110, G 150, G 320. The international debt securities market 2 brings together borrowers and lenders with diverse risk profiles and risk appetites. This special feature investigates the determinants of the currency denomination of international debt issuance. Specifically, it examines the share of aggregate issuance of international bonds and notes that is denominated in selected <b>currencies,</b> <b>and</b> estimates the impact on these currency shares of a number of plausible factors. The international market is an attractive one for studying currency choice issues, because issuers are likely to be well known outside their national boundaries, and investors are likely to be comparatively well informed. As a result, asymmetric information regarding credit quality will be relatively low. The key finding is that there is more issuance in a given currency when it is strong relative to historical averages and when long-term interest rates in that currency are high relative to those available in other major currencies. These findings hold even when controlling for demand for investable funds in that currency, as proxied by the growth of investment, or the level of home country issuance. The preferences of investors appear to play just as important a role as those of issuers in determining the terms and conditions of international bond issues...|$|R
50|$|Personal cheques {{were widely}} used in Yugoslavia in pre-inflation times. Cheques, which were {{considered}} legal tender, were accepted by all businesses. They were processed by hand and mailed by regular post, {{so there was no}} way to ensure real-time accounting. The banks therefore continued to deduct money from current accounts on the date they received the cheque, and not on the date it was issued. When inflation rose to triple and then quadruple digits, this allowed another widespread form of cost reduction or outright milking of the system. Bills from remote places would arrive six months late, causing losses to businesses. Since banks maintained no-fee mutual customer service, people would travel to small banks in rural areas on the other end of the country and cash in several cheques. They would then exchange the money for foreign currency, usually German mark and wait for the cheque to arrive. They would then convert a part of the foreign <b>currency</b> <b>amount</b> <b>and</b> repay their debt, greatly reduced by inflation. Companies, struggling to pay their work-force, adopted similar tactics.|$|R

Twin <b>currency</b> <b>and</b> debt crises differ from both pure <b>currency</b> <b>and</b> pure debt crises in their determinants, course of events, and economic consequences. We find that each type of crises has a unique set of macroeconomic causes. We also identify internal contagion and selection bias effects, which may lead to biased empirical estimates if twin crises are not treated as a specific type of crises. Such a separation allows to significantly improve the efficiency of early warning systems especially for debt <b>and</b> twin crises. <b>currency</b> crises, debt crises, twin crises, emerging markets...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} model that {{illustrates}} the close relationship between {{the possibility of a}} <b>currency</b> crisis <b>and</b> the <b>amount</b> of private-sector debt within a four-stage sequential game framework. In the first stage, the government announces its exchange rate policy, and all agents in the economy receive probabilistic information about a future shock that will occur in the last stage. This shock will affect unemployment and net returns on private sector investment. The private sector in stage 2 forms expectations about the future exchange rate and engages in risky investments. In stage 3, the government faces costs due to expectations of future devaluation and private-sector debt, anticipating the stochastic shock that will occur in stage 4 and may or may not find it optimal to pre-emptively abandon its fixed exchange rate policy. The government can commit already in stage 1 to bailing out part of the private sector's outstanding debt if a bad shock occurs or wait until stage 4 to give an optimal bailout. A commitment to bailing out provides a reconciliation of the multiple equilibria that result from self-fulfilling expectations. Moreover, the government may sometimes avert currency crises by committing to bailing out. currency crisis; private-sector debt; sequential game analysis; financial crises...|$|R
