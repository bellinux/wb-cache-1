50|$|Although a SID {{will keep}} {{aircraft}} away from terrain, it is optimized for {{air traffic control}} route of flight and will not always provide the lowest <b>climb</b> <b>gradient.</b> It strikes a balance between terrain and obstacle avoidance, noise abatement (if necessary), and airspace management considerations. In order to legally fly a SID, a pilot must possess at least {{the current version of}} the SID's textual description. SIDs in the United States are created by either the military (the USAF or USN) or the FAA (which includes US Army fields). The main difference between US military and civilian SIDs is that military SIDs depict obstacles, ATC <b>climb</b> <b>gradients,</b> and obstacle <b>climb</b> <b>gradients,</b> while civilian SIDs depict only minimum obstacle <b>climb</b> <b>gradients.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1944, SNCF {{reviewed}} its predicted postwar {{traffic requirements}} and determined {{a requirement for}} a locomotive capable of hauling passenger trains of 700-800 tonnes at 120 km/h, and capable of <b>climbing</b> <b>gradients</b> of 1 in 125 (8‰).|$|R
5000|$|Terrain {{east and}} west of the airport greatly impacts the {{available}} runway length. Runway 27 (heading west) has a <b>climb</b> <b>gradient</b> of [...] feet per nautical mile. Taking off to the east requires a [...] climb rate.|$|R
50|$|During {{construction}} of the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed line, a track ran temporarily from the station to the high-speed line. This temporary connection was used for track laying on the new line. It <b>climbed</b> <b>gradients</b> of up to 5.5 percent.|$|R
50|$|Calculation of {{the flight}} {{performance}} indicated that with a reported 6.007 lbs aircraft weight (allowable for Datah Dawai according to the airline's SOP) and two engines operation, the aircraft could climb as high as 200 ft height from the runway elevation at 533.3 meter range (first segment climb). The aircraft {{should be able to}} reach 500 ft at 1.261 meters range (second segment climb). This performance capability will assure a safe clearance from existing obstacles. Using a linearized performance model, applying the actual weight of 6.572 lbs, the net <b>gradient</b> <b>climb</b> was calculated to be 12.6%. A correction factor applied to the linearized model resulting in an estimated <b>climb</b> <b>gradient</b> of 11%. With this <b>climb</b> <b>gradient</b> the aircraft can only reach 176 ft at 533.3m range, instead of the required 200 ft. At 176 ft above airport ground level, the aircraft height above the top of the trees was 11 ft (marginal).|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{air with}} higher {{humidity}} is less dense, providing lower lift and lower propeller or turbine efficiency (this is somewhat offset by decreased drag). Pilots must take humidity {{into account when}} calculating takeoff distances because high humidity will require longer runways and will decrease the <b>climb</b> <b>gradient.</b>|$|R
50|$|Above {{the tube}} nest the water space widens {{to form an}} {{increased}} reservoir, protecting against tilting. Sentinel's drawings permitted a hill <b>climb</b> <b>gradient</b> of 1 in 6.

40|$|Meeting the Silent Aircraft Initiative (SAI) design goal during {{take-off}} {{drives the}} aircraft and engine design towards a multi-engine configuration with low specific thrust and high cruise altitude. These design choices enable the engine fan {{to operate at}} part-speed during take-off, significantly increasing {{the benefit of a}} variable area nozzle in relation to fan and jet source noise reduction. By optimizing the thrust and <b>climb</b> <b>gradient</b> for low jet noise during the entire take-off it is possible to reduce jet noise to the SAI target of 60 dBA. Using this approach overall aircraft noise meets the SAI target at the sideline location but is approximately 5 dBA above the target at the flyover location. By considering turbomachinery and airframe noise sources when optimizing thrust and <b>climb</b> <b>gradient</b> it is possible to match the peak noise produced at all times during take-off giving an overall noise level of 62 dBA...|$|R

5|$|For {{aerodynamic}} aircraft which operate {{relative to}} the air, winds affect groundspeed, {{and in the case}} of lighter-than-air vehicles, wind may play a significant or solitary role in their movement and ground track. The velocity of surface wind is generally the primary factor governing the direction of flight operations at an airport, and airfield runways are aligned to account for the common wind direction(s) of the local area. While taking off with a tailwind may be necessary under certain circumstances, a headwind is generally desirable. A tailwind increases takeoff distance required and decreases the <b>climb</b> <b>gradient.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{critical}} {{points of}} Lagrangians occur at saddle points, {{rather than at}} local maxima (or minima). Unfortunately, many numerical optimization techniques, such as hill <b>climbing,</b> <b>gradient</b> descent, some of the quasi-Newton methods, among others, are designed to find local maxima (or minima) and not saddle points. For this reason, one must either modify the formulation to ensure that it's a minimization problem (for example, by extremizing {{the square of the}} gradient of the Lagrangian as below), or else use an optimization technique that finds stationary points (such as Newton's method without an extremum seeking line search) and not necessarily extrema.|$|R

A comparison of the vortex induced rolling moment results at a separation scale distance of 0. 70 km with those measured in full scale flight indicate good agreement for the unattenuated vortex configuration. The comparison also indicates that the spline effectiveness in flight was greater than in the ground facility test.

50|$|Following {{contemporary}} American design philosophy, the M103 {{was built}} with a two-piece, cast elliptic armor scheme, {{similar to the}} M48’s design. It featured seven road wheels per side, mounted with long-arm independent torsion bars. The 28” track was shoed in steel backed rubber chevron tracks, allowing for a ground pressure of 12.9 psi. The Continental AV-1790 engine was placed {{at the rear of}} the tank, and produced a maximum output of 810 horsepower and 1600 foot-pound of torque, fed through a General Motors CD-850-4 3-speed transmission.

50|$|Thrust gates, or gaps, in the {{trailing}} edge flaps {{may be required}} to minimise interference between the engine flow and deployed flaps. In the absence of an in-board aileron, which provides a gap in many flap installations, a modified flap section may be needed. The thrust gate on the Boeing 757 was provided by a single-slotted flap in between the inboard and outboard double-slotted flaps. The A320, A330, A340 and A380 have no in-board aileron. No thrust gate is required in the continuous, single-slotted flap. Interference in the go-around case while the flaps are still fully deployed can cause increased drag which must not compromise the <b>climb</b> <b>gradient.</b>|$|R

This article presents a novel algorithm for distributed self-reconfiguration by combining cellular automata and L-systems. Cellular automata is used to handle the relative motion planning of decentralized modules. L-systems are introduced to provide a topological description for the target configuration. The turtle interpretation is extended to modular robotics to generate local predictions for distributed modules from global description.

A gradient optimizing computer program was developed to minimize direct operating cost (DOC) {{as a function of}} airplane geometry. In this way, the best airplane operating under one set of constraints can be compared with the best operating under another. A constant 30 -passenger fuselage and rubberized engines based on the General Electric CT- 7 were used as a baseline. All aircraft had to have a 600 nautical mile maximum range and were designed to FAR part 25 structural integrity and <b>climb</b> <b>gradient</b> regulations.

Both three and four engine rake-offs are examined and the influence of the ground on lift, drag and pitching moment is included. Only small variations in achieved {{rotation and}} unstick speeds can be permitted if low <b>climb</b> <b>gradients</b> or large take-off distance are to be avoided.
