40|$|For robust design it is {{desirable}} to allow the design requirements to vary within a certain range rather than setting point targets. This is particularly important {{during the early stages}} of design when {{little is known about the}} system and its requirements. Toward this end, design <b>capability</b> <b>indices</b> are developed in this paper to assess the capability of a family of designs, represented by a range of top-level design specifications, to satisfy a ranged set of design requirements. Design <b>capability</b> <b>indices</b> are based on process <b>capability</b> <b>indices</b> from statistical process control and provide a single objective, alternate approach to the use of Taguchi's signal-to- noise ratio which is often used for robust design. Successful implementation of design <b>capability</b> <b>indices</b> ensures that a family of designs conforms to a given ranged set of design requirements. To demonstrate an application and the usefulness of design <b>capability</b> <b>indices,</b> the design of a solar powered irrigation system is presented.

50|$|The process {{capability}} is a measurable property {{of a process}} to the specification, expressed as a process <b>capability</b> <b>index</b> (e.g., Cpk or Cpm) or as a process performance index (e.g., Ppk or Ppm). The output of this measurement is usually illustrated by a histogram and calculations that predict how many parts will be produced out of specification (OOS).|$|E
50|$|The process {{capability}} of systems, materials, and products {{needs to be}} compatible with the specified engineering tolerances. Process controls must be in place and an effective Quality management system, such as Total Quality Management, needs to keep actual production within the desired tolerances. A process <b>capability</b> <b>index</b> is used to indicate the relationship between tolerances and actual measured production.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the process}} {{capability}} {{is a function}} of the specification, the Process <b>Capability</b> <b>Index</b> is only as good as the specification. For instance, if the specification came from an engineering guideline without considering the function and criticality of the part, a discussion around process capability is useless, and would have more benefits if focused on what are the real risks of having a part borderline out of specification. The loss function of Taguchi better illustrates this concept.|$|E

5000|$|In process {{improvement}} efforts, the process <b>capability</b> <b>index</b> or process capability ratio is a statistical measure of process capability: {{the ability of}} a process to produce output within specification limits.

This is often determined through statistical process control. Variations in the product are correlated to aspects of the process and eliminated. The most common metric used is the process <b>capability</b> <b>index</b> Cpk. A Cpk of 1.0 is considered the baseline acceptance for full production go-ahead.|$|E
50|$|The {{ability of}} a process to meet {{specifications}} can be expressed as a single number using a process <b>capability</b> <b>index</b> {{or it can be}} assessed using control charts.

Statistical process control defines techniques to properly differentiate between stable processes, processes that are drifting (experiencing a long-term change in the mean of the output), and processes that are growing more variable. Process capability indices are only meaningful for processes that are stable (in a state of statistical control).|$|E

40|$|In today&# 039;s {{competitive}} business environment, it {{is becoming}} more crucial than ever to assess precisely process losses due to non-compliance to customer specifications. To assess these losses, industry is widely using process <b>capability</b> <b>indices</b> for performance evaluation of their processes. Determination of the performance capability of a stable process using the standard process <b>capability</b> <b>indices</b> requires that the underlying process data should follow a normal distribution. However, if the data is non-normal, measuring process capability using conventional methods can lead to erroneous results. Different process <b>capability</b> <b>indices</b> such as Clements percentile method and data transformation method have been proposed {{to deal with the}} non-normal situation. Although these methods are practiced in industry, there is insufficient literature to assess the accuracy of these methods under mild and severe departures from normality.

40|$|Classic process {{capability}} indices such as C a, C p and C pk are well-known {{process capability}} indices, which are using widely. Since, process capability indices predict {{the capability of}} a process, they must have a significant relation with rate of rejects and losses.

Therefore, the loss-based indices are more appropriate and suitable indices to predict the capability of a process.

Medical Outcomes Study 36 -Item Short-Form Healthy Survey (SF- 36) and Locomotors <b>Capabilities</b> <b>Index</b> were used for quality of life assessment.

40|$|Abstract: Process {{capability}} indices such as Cp, Cpk, Cpu and Cpl {{are common}} metrics {{to evaluate and}} predict {{the performance of a}} process.

This paper defines a novel process <b>capability</b> <b>index</b> called asymmetric inverted normal loss-based process <b>capability</b> <b>index</b> (AIPCI) with the aid of asymmetric inverted normal loss function. The logical idea is to compare the standard loss for a capable process with other cases.

For example, the process capability of machines is {{an important aspect of}} SQC, which consists in evaluating the ability of a production process to perform with the required specifications. In other words, the process capability measures the ability of a process of producing acceptable products according to the established specifications. The most common indicator used to measure the process capability is the process <b>capability</b> <b>index,</b> which depends on the process standard deviation. In practice, the standard deviation is unknown, and the process <b>capability</b> <b>index</b> is thus estimated by using an estimator of the process standard deviation. In this paper, we describe the most common estimators of the process standard deviation, and define the corresponding estimators of the process <b>capability</b> <b>index.</b> A bound for the bias ratio of the various estimators is obtained.

30|$|In this paper, {{a method}} was {{proposed}} {{to calculate the}} specific <b>capability</b> <b>indices</b> for the process in {{the second stage of}} a two-stage process. The process in the second stage is affected by the process in the first stage; therefore, sometimes the incapability in the second stage {{is a result of the}} incapability of the first stage. We omitted the effect of the quality characteristic of the first stage on the quality characteristic of process in the second stage using the residuals. The process capability for the residuals shows the specific process capability of the process in the second stage. In addition, we proposed a method to determine the specification limits of the residuals based on the specification limits of the quality characteristics in the first and second stages. The simulation studies and the real case study showed that the process <b>capability</b> <b>indices</b> for the residuals calculate the specific process capability of the process in the second stage properly. This method can be extended to be used for the multistage processes with more than two stages. Future studies may also include calculating specific process <b>capability</b> <b>indices</b> for the multistage process when each stage has several correlated quality characteristics. The linear relation between quality characteristics is considered in this paper. Therefore, calculating specific process <b>capability</b> <b>indices</b> when the relations among quality characteristics are non-linear can be considered as future research.|$|R
