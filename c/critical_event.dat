5|$|Election Special is the 2012 fifteenth studio album by American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Ry Cooder. After his 2011 album Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down, Cooder {{continued}} writing topical and storyline-inspired songs. Displeased {{with the}} Republican Party and its financial supporters, {{he also wanted}} to write an album that would address listeners during the United States presidential election of 2012, which he {{believed to be a}} <b>critical</b> <b>event</b> in the country's history. Election Special was recorded mostly at Drive-By Studios in North Hollywood and produced by Cooder.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} phase of decompression, the <b>critical</b> <b>event</b> {{is assumed to}} be the arrival of an {{arterial}} bubble in a de-saturating neurological tissue. The bubble exchanges gas with the surrounding tissue and the blood. If the bubble does not exceed a critical radius, it will eventually leave the site without growing, otherwise it will block the blood circulation and cause ischemia. The critical parameter is bubble radius. This criterion is used to prevent type II neurological symptoms. The strategy for a safe rate of ascent at this stage is to balance gas exchange.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} phase of decompression, the <b>critical</b> <b>event</b> {{is assumed to}} be the {{presence}} of a large bubble that has taken up a large quantity of dissolved gas from the adjacent tissue in a joint. If the bubble reaches a critical volume, it will have a mechanical effect on the nerve endings causing pain in a tendon. The bubble volume is the critical parameter. This criterion is used to prevent type I pain-only symptoms. The strategy for a safe ascent at this stage is to prevent any gas phase from growing beyond a critical volume.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{searched for the}} causes of <b>critical</b> <b>events</b> in Norwegian-Brazilian {{business}} relationships. <b>Critical</b> <b>events</b> were investigated through an explorative research design in dyadic business-to-business case studies. The theoretical definition of <b>critical</b> <b>events</b> and governance mechanisms is based on previous literature, and the empirical part consists of a combined approach using interviews to elaborate questionnaires. Data collection took place in Rio de Janeiro, {{over a period of}} five weeks. In total three dyads (business relationships between two firms) were investigated. In the first dyad, the average results showed significantly different perceptions among the parts, where the Brazilian side rated the cause of <b>critical</b> <b>events</b> as a result of lack of formal governance, and the Norwegian side as a lack of informal governance. In the second and third dyad, the parts agreed on lack of formal governance as the main cause of <b>critical</b> <b>events.</b> The correlation analysis showed that governance level appears not to be related to importance of <b>critical</b> <b>events</b> on the Norwegian companies. While on the Brazilian companies, events caused by formal governance mechanisms are associated with a higher level of importance, therefore partially confirming previous studies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUsing the {{information}} regarding <b>critical</b> <b>events</b> to support {{decision making in}} Intensive Care Units would be useful. However it is seldom used in real settings as {{the information}} regarding those <b>critical</b> <b>events</b> is difficult to gather and make available in real time.

From data collected using an automatic and real-time data acquisition system it is possible to calculate the <b>critical</b> <b>events</b> regarding five variables that are usually monitored in an ICU. These results are presented to the medical and nursing staff in a friendly and intuitive mode. Using a color code our system provides visual warnings related to the evolution of the monitored variables values.

2500|$|The {{area has}} also been the site of several {{important}} political protests and parades. A protest march of 400 unemployed workers led by the populist Jacob Coxey occurred on Pennsylvania Avenue on April 30, 1894. The group became known as Coxey's Army, and this march was both the first significant popular protest march on Washington and also the first to receive national news coverage. On March 3, 1913, Alice Paul led the National American Woman Suffrage Association (a women's rights organization and precursor to the League of Women Voters) in a parade up Pennsylvania Avenue in which they demanded the right to vote. The association was {{the largest and most}} important organization in the fight for women's suffrage in the United States. The march was a <b>critical</b> <b>event</b> in the successful fight for the right to vote. The women's rights march was strongly opposed by government officials, so when the association won the right to march it set a precedent under which almost any group could march on Pennsylvania Avenue.|$|E
2500|$|UFC 40 {{proved to}} be the most <b>critical</b> <b>event</b> to date in the Zuffa era. The event was a near sellout of 13,022 at the MGM Grand Arena and sold 150,000 pay per view buys, a rate roughly double that of the {{previous}} Zuffa events. The event featured a card headlined by a highly anticipated championship grudge match between then-current UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Tito Ortiz and former UFC Superfight Champion Ken Shamrock, who had previously left to professional wrestling in the WWE before returning to MMA. It {{was the first time the}} UFC hit such a high mark since being forced [...] "underground" [...] in 1997. UFC 40 also garnered mainstream attention from massive media outlets such as ESPN and USA Today, something that was unfathomable for mixed martial arts at that point in time. Many have suggested that the success of UFC 40 and the anticipation for Ortiz vs. Shamrock saved the UFC from bankruptcy; the buyrates of the previous Zuffa shows averaged a mere 45,000 buys per event and the company was suffering deep monetary losses. The success of UFC 40 provided a glimmer of hope for the UFC and kept alive the hope that mixed martial arts could become big. Beyond the rivalry itself, the success of UFC 40 was due in part to the marketing and outreach power of crossover athletes - from Pro Wrestling to MMA and MMA to Pro Wrestling - a practice with roots in Japan's Pride Fighting Championships. Long time UFC referee [...] "Big" [...] John McCarthy said that he felt UFC 40 was the turning point in whether or not the sport of MMA would survive in America.|$|E

40|$|A {{significant}} number of scientific projects pursuing large scale, complex investigations involve dispersed research teams, which conduct a large part or their work virtually. Virtual Research Environments (VREs), cyberinfrastructure that facilitates coordinated activities amongst dispersed scientists, thus provide a rich context to study organizational evolution. Due to the constantly evolving nature of technologies, {{it is important to}} understand how teams of scientists, system developers, and managers respond to <b>critical</b> incidents. <b>Critical</b> <b>events</b> are organizational situations that trigger strategic decision making to adjust structure or redirect processes in order to maintain balance or improve an already functioning system. This study examines two prominent VREs: The United States Virtual Astronomical Observatory (US-VAO) and the HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC) in order to understand how these environments evolve through <b>critical</b> <b>events</b> and strategic choices. Communication perspectives lend themselves well to a study of VRE development and evolution because of the central role occupied by communication technologies in both the functionality and management of VREs. Using the grounded theory approach, this study uses organizational reports to trace how <b>critical</b> <b>events</b> and their resulting strategic choices shape these organizations over time.

The 2 ̆ 2 Tapestry 2 ̆ 2 is utilized in many occupational therapy and gerontology courses wherein students are studying life course development as well as with clients who have incurred impairments or changes in their status (e. g., widowhood or unemployment). The Self-Discovery Tapestry encourages individuals to indicate in color both continuous and discontinuous elements in their lives.
