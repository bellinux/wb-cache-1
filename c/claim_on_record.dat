In his statement Planinić <b>claimed</b> <b>on</b> the <b>record</b> that his club threw matches against Hajduk and Trešnjevka {{towards the end of the}} 1963-64 season in order to help those two relegation-threatened teams avoid the drop. Specifically, Planinić claimed that the match played on 31 May 1964 in Split when Hajduk beat Željezničar 4-0 was fixed, as well as the match on 7 June 1964 in Sarajevo when Željo and Trešnjevka tied 3-3.

Some have suggested that he may also be delusional in having concocted a fantasy-type personality for himself as a highly trained covert operative combating international terrorism, despite a brief and mostly non-notable military record (which states that Idema was in the Special Forces strictly in a support capacity). This opinion was echoed by Major Scott Nelson, the U.S. military spokesperson in Kabul at the time of Idema's arrest in 2004. The judge in Idema's 1994 fraud trial also questioned Idema's psychological state and ordered him to undergo evaluation prior to his sentencing.

5000|$|In Thailand, {{government}} proclamations {{and national}} museums insist that Suwannaphum was {{somewhere in the}} coast of central plain, especially at the ancient city of U Thong, which might be {{the origin of the}} Dvaravati Culture.

This tradition, however, is doubted by scholars for the same reason as the Burman claim. The migration of the Tai peoples into Southeast Asia did not occur until centuries later, long after the Pyu, Malays, Mons and Khmers had established their respective kingdoms. Suphan Buri (from the Sanskrit, Suvarnapura, [...] "Gold City") in present day southern Thailand, was founded in 877-882 as a city of the Mon-Khmer kingdom of Dvaravati with the name, Meuang Thawarawadi Si Suphannaphumi ("the Dvaravati city of Suvarnabhumi"), indicating that Dvaravati at that time identified as Suvarnabhumi.|$|R

5000|$|According to The New York Times on September 2, 2007, the Consumer Product Safety Commission met in March 2005 {{to discuss}} the dangers of ATVs. Data from 2004 showed 44,000 {{children}} under 16 injured while riding ATVs, 150 of them fatally. Says the Times, [...] "National associations of pediatricians, consumer advocates and emergency room doctors were urging the commission to ban sales of adult-size ATVs for use by children under 16 because the machines were too big and fast for young drivers to control. But {{when it came time}} to consider such a step, a staff member whose name did not appear on the meeting agenda unexpectedly weighed in." [...] That staff member was John Gibson Mullan, [...] "the agency’s director of compliance and a former lawyer for the A.T.V. industry" [...] - the Times bases the <b>claim</b> <b>on</b> a <b>recording</b> of the meeting. Mullan reportedly said that the existing system of warnings and voluntary compliance was working. The agency's hazard statistician, Robin Ingle, was not allowed to present a rebuttal. She told the Times in an interview, [...] "He had hijacked the presentation. He was distorting the numbers in order to benefit industry and defeat the petition. It was almost like he still worked for them, not us." [...] CPSC reports of ATV deaths and injuries show an increase in the raw numbers of deaths and injuries that is statistically significant. The rate of deaths and injuries, which takes into account that the number of ATVs in use has risen over the last ten years, has been shown to have experienced no statistically significant change.|$|R
50|$|When Markham {{decided to}} take on the Atlantic crossing, no pilot had yet flown {{non-stop}} from Europe to New York, and no woman had made the westward flight solo, though several had died trying.

In spite of falling short of her goal, Markham had become the first woman to cross the Atlantic east-to-west solo, and the first person to make it from England to North America non-stop from east to west.
