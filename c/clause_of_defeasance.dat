50|$|Although an {{innovation}} in its structure, the conditional penal bond {{was not the}} first English attempt to impose “fixed monetary penalties” for failure to perform on an agreement.

50|$|Historically, {{the most}} {{significant}} type of penal bond was the penal bond with conditional defeasance. A penal bond with conditional defeasance combined in one document the bond (the promise to pay a specified amount of money) with the contractual obligation. It did this in what the historian Brian Simpson called a ‘topsy-turvy’ fashion by printing the bond {{on the front of}} the document and the condition, whose performance by the obligor would render the bond void (referred to as the indenture <b>of</b> <b>defeasance),</b> on the back.|$|R
50|$|The {{etymology}} of defeasible usually {{refers to}} Middle English law of contracts, where a condition <b>of</b> <b>defeasance</b> is a <b>clause</b> that can invalidate or annul a contract or deed. Though defeat, dominate, defer, defy, deprecate and derogate {{are often used}} in the same contexts as defeasible, the verbs annul and invalidate (and nullify, overturn, rescind, vacate, repeal, debar, void, cancel, countermand, preempt, etc.) are more properly correlated with the concept of defeasibility than those words beginning with the letter d. Many dictionaries do contain the verb, to defease with past participle, defeased.|$|R

The authors empirical tests provide compelling evidence of bondholder gains, but no support for shareholder losses when a firm defeases debt. They speculate that the insignificance of the loss to shareholders is primarily due to the size disparity between the value of defeased debt and {{the market value of}} outstanding equity, since the suggested economic merits <b>of</b> <b>defeasance</b> appear unfounded. Although they cannot prove an agency motivation for defeasance, they find a very high correlation between compensation tied to earnings and defeasing debt at book gain.

40|$|The {{development}} of computationally informed formalisms for reasoning with defeasible rules affords new accounts of familiar forms of reasoning. This paper points to recent accounts of defeasible reasoning and portrays analogy, decision, and theory-formation as essentially defeasible, {{in the same}} way that statistical reasoning has been portrayed. Each portrayal depends largely on the idea of partial computation, which is inherent in actual reasoning, largely ignored by past formalizers, and formalizable now. 1. INTRODUCTION. 1 a. DEFEASIBLE REASONING Defeasible reasoning refers to non-demonstrative reasoning where the reasoning makes explicit use of rules that admit <b>of</b> <b>defeasance</b> (other authors have used the words exception, preemption, preclusion, interference, rebutment, and defeat). Defeasible reasoning dates to antiquity but formalism has appeared only in recent decades, especially beginning with Pollock, who follows Chisholm; and Kyburg, who responds to Reichenbach; Nute, Glymour- [...] ...|$|R

40|$|To know a {{language}} does not only mean to know its vocabulary, {{but how to}} link the words, the word order in a clause {{as well as the}} order <b>of</b> <b>clauses</b> in a sentence, their role and their relations to each other. The relationship <b>of</b> the <b>clauses</b> in a sentence is especially important concerning complex sentences, in which the <b>clauses</b> are not <b>of</b> the same level but show a dependency. So, precisely the adverbial <b>clauses</b> <b>of</b> time {{are the ones that are}} highly complicated and create confusion. For this reason, most of the people try to avoid them, and use simple clauses instead, nevertheless, this somehow loses the meaning and originality of the idea.
