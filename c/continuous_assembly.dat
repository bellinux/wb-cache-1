Omega (overlap-graph metagenome assembler) {{was developed for}} assembling and scaffolding Illumina sequencing data of microbial communities. Results: Omega found overlaps between reads using a prefix/suffix hash table. The overlap graph of reads was simplified by removing transitive edges and trimming short branches. Unitigs were generated based on minimum cost flow analysis of the overlap graph and then merged to contigs and scaffolds using mate-pair information. In comparison with three de Bruijn graph assemblers (SOAPdenovo, IDBA-UD and MetaVelvet), Omega provided comparable overall per-formance on a HiSeq 100 -bp dataset and superior performance on a MiSeq 300 -bp dataset. In comparison with Celera on the MiSeq data-set, Omega provided more <b>continuous</b> <b>assemblies</b> overall using {{a fraction of the}} computing time of existing overlap-layout-consensus assemblers.

Neural fields are <b>continuous</b> <b>assemblies</b> of mesoscopic models arising when modeling macroscopic {{parts of the}} brain. They are modeled by nonlinear integro-differential equations. We rigorously prove, {{for the first time}} to our knowledge, sufficient conditions for the stability of their stationary solutions. We use two methods 1) the computation of the eigenvalues of the linear operator defined by the linearized equations and 2) the formulation of the problem as a fixed point problem. The first method involves tools of functional analysis and yields a new estimate of the semigroup of the previous linear operator using the eigenvalues of its infinitesimal generator. It yields a sufficient condition for stability which is independent of the characteristics of the delays. The second method allows us to find new sufficient conditions for the stability of stationary solutions which depend upon the values of the delays. These conditions are very easy to evaluate numerically. We illustrate the conservativeness of the bounds with a comparison with numerical simulation.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe <b>continuous</b> <b>assembly</b> and {{disassembly}} of actin filament networks {{is vital}} for cellular processes including division, growth, and motility. Network remodeling is facilitated by cofilins, a family of essential regulatory proteins that fragment actin filaments. Cofilin induces net structural changes in filaments that render them more compliant in bending and twisting. A model in which local stress accumulation at mechanical discontinuities, such as boundaries of bare and cofilin-decorated filament segments, accounts for the cofilin concentration dependence of severing, including maximal activity at sub-stoichiometric binding densities. Real-time imaging of cofilin-mediated filament severing supports the boundary-fracture model. The severing model predicts that fragmentation is promoted by factors modulating filament mechanics (e. g. tethering, cross-linking, or deformation), possibly explaining enhanced in vivo severing activities...|$|E

Here we formulate two important refinements to the explanation of bond energetics. First, energy surface calculations in the elastic filament approximation reveal a finite stabilizing barrier assumed a simple Lennard-Jones-like potential for protein bonds. The presence of a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) cap represented by straight segments is necessary, as it is predicted for a long time. In the lack of such a cap, the protofilaments are either in an absolutely stable or absolutely unstable state. Second, our calculations show that this barrier appears only if the mechanical energy associated with the conformational change after GTP hydrolysis (curling energy) {{is larger than the}} strength of lateral bonds.

GIT 1 phosphorylation on serine 46 was abrograted by PKD 3 depletion, thereby identifying GIT 1 as the first specific substrate for this kinase.

How cells orchestrate adhesion turnover is only partially understood. We {{provide evidence for}} a novel mechanistic insight into focal adhesion (FA) dynamics by demonstrating that integrin cytoplasmic domain–associated protein 1 (ICAP- 1) slows down FA assembly. Live cell imaging, which was performed in both Icap- 1 –deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts and cells expressing active β 1 integrin, shows that the integrin high affinity state favored by talin is antagonistically controlled by ICAP- 1. This affinity switch results in modulation in the speed of FA assembly and, consequently, of cell spreading and migration. Unexpectedly, the ICAP- 1 –dependent decrease in integrin affinity allows cell sensing of matrix surface density, suggesting that integrin conformational changes are important in mechanotransduction.

Upon expression of wildtype or kinase-dead forms of the protein, dendrite growth by Xenopus retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) was unchanged. In contrast, maintaining a low, but significant level, of LIMK 1 function in the RGC axon is critical for proper extension. Interestingly, bone morphogenetic protein receptor II (BMPRII) is a major regulator of LIMK 1 in extending RGC axons, as expression of a BMPRII lacking the LIMK 1 binding region caused a dramatic shortening of the axons. Previously, we found that BMPRIIs stimulate dendrite initiation in vivo. Thus, the fact that manipulation of LIMK 1 activity failed to alter dendrite growth suggests that BMPs may activate distinct signalling pathways in axons and dendrites...|$|E

40|$|SummaryHow cells control {{organelle}} size is {{an elusive}} problem. Two predominant models for size control can be distinguished: (1) induced control, where organelle genesis, maintenance, and disassembly are three separate {{programs that are}} activated in response to size change [1, 2], and (2) constitutive control, where stable size results from the balance between <b>continuous</b> organelle <b>assembly</b> and disassembly [3, 4]. The problem has been studied in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii because the flagella are easy to measure, their size changes only in the length dimension, and the genetics are comparable to yeast [5]. Length dynamics in Chlamydomonas flagella are quite robust: they maintain a length of about 12  μm and recover from amputation in about 90  min with a growth rate that decreases smoothly to zero as the length approaches 12  μm [6]. Despite a wealth of experimental studies, existing data are consistent with both induced and constitutive control models for flagella. Here we developed novel microfluidic trapping and laser microsurgery techniques in Chlamydomonas to distinguish between length control models by measuring the two flagella on a single cell as they equilibrate after amputation of a single flagellum.

Herein, we report the preparation of polysaccharide capsules via atom transfer radical polymerization-mediated <b>continuous</b> <b>assembly</b> of polymers (CAPATRP) on silica templates using methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HA) as the macrocrosslinker. This approach affords HA capsules with controllable wall thickness and tunable stiffness. The influence of capsule stiffness on cellular interaction and intracellular distribution is systematically investigated using flow cytometry, imaging flow cytometry, and deconvolution microscopy. The softest HA capsules with a stiffness (γ) of 7. 5 mN m- 1 possess higher cell surface binding and cellular association when compared to stiffer capsules with γ of 17. 6 - 28. 9 mN m- 1. Furthermore, the uptake of HA capsules is a stiffness-dependent process, with slower and less cellular internalization observed with increasing capsule stiffness. Nevertheless, regardless of the stiffness, all internalized capsules are deformed and located in the lysosomes. These findings offer insights into the influence of capsule stiffness on cellular interaction as well as intracellular fate, providing information for the design of rational polymer capsules for biomedical applications.

Proplatelets elongate at an average rate of 0. 85 μm/min in a microtubule-dependent process. Addition of rhodamine-tubulin to permeabilized proplatelets, immunofluorescence microscopy of the microtubule plus-end marker end-binding protein 3 (EB 3), and fluorescence time-lapse microscopy of EB 3 –green fluorescent protein (GFP) –expressing megakaryocytes reveal that microtubules, organized as bipolar arrays, continuously polymerize throughout the proplatelet. In immature megakaryocytes lacking proplatelets, microtubule plus-ends initiate and grow by centrosomal nucleation at rates of 8. 9 to 12. 3 μm/min. In contrast, plus-end growth rates of microtubules within proplatelets are highly variable (1. 5 - 23. 5 μm/min) and are both slower and faster than those seen in immature cells. Despite the <b>continuous</b> <b>assembly</b> of microtubules, proplatelets continue to elongate when net microtubule assembly is arrested. One alternative mechanism for force generation is microtubule sliding. Triton X- 100 –permeabilized proplatelets containing dynein and its regulatory complex, dynactin, but not kinesin, elongate {{with the addition of}} adenosine triphosphate (ATP) at a rate of 0. 65 μm/min. Retroviral expression in megakaryocytes of dynamitin (p 50), which disrupts dynactindynein function, inhibits proplatelet elongation.

The best-established model for flagellar length (FL) control is set by the balance of <b>continuous</b> MT <b>assembly</b> and disassembly occurring at the flagellar tip. Because steady-state assembly of tubulin onto the distal end of the flagellum requires intraflagellar transport (IFT) [...] a bidirectional movement of large protein complexes that occurs within the flagellum [...] FL control must rely upon the regulation of IFT. This does not preclude that other pathways might "directly" affect MT assembly and disassembly. Now, among the superfamily of kinesins, family- 13 (MCAK/KIF 2) members exhibit a MT-depolymerizing activity responsible for their essential functions in mitosis. Here we present a novel family- 13 kinesin from the flagellated protozoan parasite Leishmania major, that localizes essentially to the flagellum, and whose overexpression produces flagellar shortening and knockdown yields long flagella.

40|$|Flagellar length {{regulation}} {{provides a}} simple model system {{for addressing the}} general problem of organelle size control. Based on a systems-level analysis of flagellar dynamics, we have proposed a mechanism for flagellar length control in which length is set by the balance of <b>continuous</b> flagellar <b>assembly</b> and disassembly. The model proposes that the assembly rate is length dependent due to the inherent length dependence of intraflagellar transport, whereas disassembly is length independent, such that the two rates can only reach a balance point at a single length. In this report, we test this theoretical model by using three different measurements: 1) the quantity of intraflagellar transport machinery {{as a function of}} length, 2) the variation of flagellar length as a function of flagellar number, and 3) the rate of flagellar growth as a function of length. We find that the quantity of intraflagellar transport machinery is independent of length, that flagellar length is a decreasing function of flagellar number, and that flagellar growth rate in regenerating flagella depends on length and not on the time since regeneration began. These results are consistent with the balance-point model for length control. The three strategies used here are not limited to flagella and can in principle be adapted to probe size control systems for any organelle...|$|R

The best-established model for flagellar length (FL) control is set by the balance of <b>continuous</b> MT <b>assembly</b> and disassembly occurring at the flagellar tip [2, 3]. Because steady-state assembly of tubulin onto the distal end of the flagellum requires intraflagellar transport (IFT) —a bidirectional movement of large protein complexes that occurs within the flagellum—FL control must rely upon the regulation of IFT [4, 5]. This does not preclude that other pathways might “directly” affect MT assembly and disassembly [4]. Now, among the superfamily of kinesins, family- 13 (MCAK/KIF 2) members exhibit a MT-depolymerizing activity responsible for their essential functions in mitosis [6]. Here we present a novel family- 13 kinesin from the flagellated protozoan parasite Leishmania major, that localizes essentially to the flagellum, and whose overexpression produces flagellar shortening and knockdown yields long flagella. Using negative mutants, we demonstrate that this phenotype is linked with the MT-binding and -depolymerizing activity of this kinesin. This is the first report of an effector protein involved in FL control through a direct action in MT dynamics, thus this finding complements the assembly–disassembly model...|$|R
