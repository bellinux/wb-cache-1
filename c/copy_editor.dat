5|$|In January 1964 Fleming went to Goldeneye {{for what}} {{proved to be}} his last holiday and wrote {{the first draft of}} The Man with the Golden Gun. He was {{dissatisfied}} with it and wrote to William Plomer, the <b>copy</b> <b>editor</b> of his novels, asking for it to be rewritten. Fleming became increasingly unhappy with the book and considered rewriting it, but was dissuaded by Plomer, who considered it viable for publication.|$|E
5|$|The {{first draft}} {{and part of}} the editing process was {{completed}} before Fleming's death and the manuscript had passed through the hands of his <b>copy</b> <b>editor,</b> William Plomer, but it was not as polished as other Bond stories. Much of the detail contained in the previous novels was missing, as this was often added by Fleming in the second draft. Publishers Jonathan Cape passed the manuscript to Kingsley Amis for his thoughts and advice on the story, although his suggestions were not subsequently used.|$|E

40|$|The {{newspaper}} {{industry has}} faced colossal shifts {{over the past}} several decades because of the Information Age and changing needs of readership. <b>Copy</b> <b>editors</b> have been among the most affected as the newsroom seeks to adapt. These editors have had an increasing number of responsibilities divided among fewer people. This study predicted that <b>copy</b> <b>editors</b> have experienced role conflict, which would manifest itself as job satisfaction and responsibility conflict. A questionnaire was developed in Qualtrics and sent out through the American <b>Copy</b> <b>Editors</b> Society as well as directly to managing <b>editors</b> and <b>copy</b> <b>editors.</b> Analysis found that most copy editors' responsibilities conflict at least part of the time - not only against deadline, but against one another. The number of tasks <b>copy</b> <b>editors</b> have is a predictor for the frequency of responsibility conflict. Social media, website management, and page proofs are three of the tasks <b>copy</b> <b>editors</b> might have that are moderately correlated with the frequency of role conflict. It might be best to have one person focus on those types of tasks, which would allow all of the other editors take on tasks that require longer, in-depth tasks, rather than have all the editors be perpetually distracted. Analysis also found that the alignment of copy editors' values with those of the company were more highly correlated than any other satisfaction variable, including salary, shifts, and co-workers. Therefore, it might be beneficial to work to communicate why and how the company's values developed into its current standards...|$|R

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] <b>Copy</b> <b>editors</b> have gained a reputation as the most dissatisfied workers in the newsroom. Identifying the causes of workplace stress and addressing those issues is an important first step to improving the workplace morale - and from there, the job satisfaction - of <b>copy</b> <b>editors.</b> New technology can be a cause of workplace stress. <b>Copy</b> <b>editors,</b> perhaps more {{than anyone else in the}} newsroom, have to adjust to these new ways of producing the news, adding to the pressure of a daily or weekly deadline. This study predicts that newspaper copy editors' attitudes toward new technology will be positively correlated with job satisfaction. The study was conducted on a sample of 212 newspaper <b>copy</b> <b>editors</b> whose workplaces are affiliated with either the American Society of Newspaper Editors or the American <b>Copy</b> <b>Editors</b> Society. Analysis of the questionnaires found that the hypothesis was supported. The results of this study indicate that <b>copy</b> <b>editors</b> who have negative attitudes toward technology will have lower job satisfaction than those who don't. Newspapers could address this issue by offering more frequent or better training solutions that could help ease the problem, and thus increase workplace satisfaction...|$|R
