5|$|Intermediate {{dispersion}} Spectrograph and Imaging System – medium resolution (R = 1,800-20,000) long-slit dual-beam optical spectrograph. Mounted at <b>Cassegrain</b> focus. ISIS {{was one of}} {{the original}} first generation of WHT instruments.|$|E
5|$|Long-slit Intermediate Resolution Infrared Spectrograph – {{near-infrared}} imager/spectrograph, with imaging over a 4' field, spectral resolutions R = 700-2500, spectropolarimetry, {{and long}} slit and multi-object slit-masks. Mounted at <b>Cassegrain</b> focus.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} the WHT is {{a popular}} telescope for single-purpose visitor instruments, which {{in recent years have}} included GHαFaS, INTEGRAL, PLANETPOL, PNS, SAURON, FASTCAM and ULTRACAM. Visitor instruments can use either the <b>Cassegrain</b> focus or one of the Nasmyth foci.|$|E

50|$|Catadioptric <b>Cassegrains</b> use two mirrors, {{often with}} a spherical primary mirror to reduce cost, {{combined}} with refractive corrector element(s) to correct the resulting aberrations.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{there is}} only one surface that needs to be ground and {{polished}} into a complex shape, overall fabrication is much simpler than other telescope designs (Gregorians, <b>cassegrains,</b> and early refractors had two surfaces that need figuring. Later achromatic refractor objectives had four surfaces that have to be figured).|$|R
5|$|AMiBA was {{initially}} configured as a 7-element interferometer, using 0.576m <b>Cassegrain</b> dishes {{mounted on a}} 6m carbon fibre hexapod mount. It is located on Mauna Loa, Hawaii, and observes at 3mm (86–102GHz) to minimize foreground emission from other, non-thermal sources. The telescope has a retractable shelter, made from seven steel trusses and PVC fabric.|$|E
5|$|Optically, the HST is a <b>Cassegrain</b> {{reflector}} of Ritchey–Chrétien design, as {{are most}} large professional telescopes. This design, with two hyperbolic mirrors, {{is known for}} good imaging performance over a wide field of view, with the disadvantage that the mirrors have shapes {{that are hard to}} fabricate and test. The mirror and optical systems of the telescope determine the final performance, and they were designed to exacting specifications. Optical telescopes typically have mirrors polished to an accuracy of about a tenth of the wavelength of visible light, but the Space Telescope was to be used for observations from the visible through the ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths) and was specified to be diffraction limited {{to take full advantage of}} the space environment. Therefore, its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of 10nanometers, or about 1/65 of the wavelength of red light. On the long wavelength end, the OTA was not designed with optimum IR performance in mind—for example, the mirrors are kept at stable (and warm, about 15°C) temperatures by heaters. This limits Hubble's performance as an infrared telescope.|$|E
25|$|Gregorian– Similar to the <b>Cassegrain</b> design {{except that}} the {{secondary}} reflector is concave, (ellipsoidal) in shape. Aperture efficiency over 70% can be achieved.|$|E
5000|$|For {{portable}} Newtonians collimation {{can be a}} problem. The {{primary and}} secondary {{can get out of}} alignment from the shocks associated with transport and handling. This means the telescope may need to be re-aligned (collimated) every time it is set up. Other designs such as refractors and catadioptrics (specifically Maksutov <b>cassegrains)</b> have fixed collimation.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{telescope}} designs that {{take advantage of}} placing one or more full-diameter lenses (commonly called a [...] "corrector plate") {{in front of a}} spherical primary mirror. These designs take advantage of all the surfaces being [...] "spherically symmetrical" [...] and were originally invented to create optical systems with very fast focal ratios (wide fields of view) with little coma or astigmatism for use as astrographic cameras. They work by combining a spherical mirror's ability to reflect light back to the same point with a large lens {{at the front of the}} system (a corrector) that slightly bends the incoming light, allowing the spherical mirror to image objects at infinity. Some of these designs have been adapted to create compact, long-focal-length catadioptric <b>cassegrains.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the optical system for the Viking Orbiter spacecraft is presented. Each spacecraft consisted of an orbiter and a lander, and the orbiter provided support during the lander descent, landing and operation on the Martian surface, and prior to separation the orbiter provided science data for site selection and certification. To support these objectives each orbiter carried twin camera systems with identical 475 mm f/ 3. 5 telescopes. The {{development of}} the Visual Imaging Subsystem which used all spherical catadioptric <b>cassegrains</b> with all elements fabricated from pure fused silica and Mangin primary mirrors is described. Computer aided design optimization and the ray aberration analysis of the final design are presented. The Viking telescopes had high theoretical and measured performance and obtained many high quality images of the Martian surface...|$|R
25|$|The 9S35 radar of the {{original}} Buk TELAR uses a mechanical scan of a <b>Cassegrain</b> antenna reflector, where the Buk-M2 TELAR design used a PESA, for tracking and missile guidance.|$|E
25|$|Isaac Newton is {{credited}} with building the first reflector in 1668 with a design that incorporated a small flat diagonal mirror to reflect the light to an eyepiece mounted {{on the side of}} the telescope. Laurent <b>Cassegrain</b> in 1672 described the design of a reflector with a small convex secondary mirror to reflect light through a central hole in the main mirror.|$|E
25|$|Arrays of feeds– In {{order to}} produce an {{arbitrary}} shaped beam, instead of one feed horn, an array of feed horns clustered around the focal point can be used. Array-fed antennas are often used on communication satellites, particularly direct broadcast satellites, to create a downlink radiation pattern to cover a particular continent or coverage area. They are often used with secondary reflector antennas such as the <b>Cassegrain.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of a passive heterodyne receiver with respect to its imaging performance (transfer function) and its heterodyne efficiency shows departures from the results which are obtained in strictly coherent or incoherent imaging systems. The cascading property of modulation transfer function analysis must be carefully applied, since the coherent transfer function of the optical receiver and that due to the local oscillator-detector combination are not separable but are related by the convolution of their products. Application of these results to a spacelab-type optical heterodyne receiver shows that resolutions {{of the order of}} 1. 5 to 2. 0 km are possible for worst-case type orbital scenarios. In addition to an {{analysis of}} the derogatory effects of sampling (aliasing) a comparison of obscured-type receivers (e. g., <b>Cassegrains)</b> with unobscured receivers shows that both resolution and efficiency are severly degraded in an obscured-type receiver and, consequently, should not be used for passive heterodyne detection schemes...|$|R
40|$|The {{principles}} of transfer function analysis {{are applied to}} a passive optical heterodyne receiver to obtain the modulation transfer function (MTF). MTF calculations are performed based on an optical platform which is imaging vertically varying profiles at worst case shuttle orbit altitudes. An analysis of the derogatory effects of sampling (aliasing) and central obscurations on both resolution and heterodyne efficiency is given. It is found that the cascading property of MTF analysis must be carefully applied since the coherent transfer function of the optical receiver and that due to the local oscillator-detector combination are not separable but are related by the convolution of their products. Application of these results to the specific case of a space-lab type optical heterodyne receiver shows that resolutions {{of the order of}} 1. 5 - 2. 0 Km are possible for worst-case type orbital scenarios. Further, comparison of obscured-type receivers (e. g., <b>Cassegrains)</b> with unobscured receivers shows that both resolution and efficiency are severely degraded in an obscured-type receiver and consequently should not be used for a passive heterodyne detection scheme...|$|R
40|$|Oxygen {{production}} from lunar raw materials {{is critical for}} sustaining a manned lunar base but is very power intensive. Solar concentrators are a well-developed technology for harnessing the Sun s energy to heat regolith to high temperatures (over 1375 K). The high temperature and potential material incompatibilities present numerous technical challenges. This study compares and contrasts different solar concentrator designs that have been developed, such as <b>Cassegrains,</b> offset parabolas, compound parabolic concentrators, and secondary concentrators. Differences between concentrators made from lenses and mirrors, and between rigid and flexible concentrators are also discussed. Possible substrate elements for a rigid mirror concentrator are selected and then compared, using the following (target) criteria: (low) coefficient of thermal expansion, (high) modulus of elasticity, and (low) density. Several potential lunar locations for solar concentrators are compared; environmental and processing-related challenges related to dust and optical surfaces are addressed. This brief technology survey examines various sources of thermal energy that can be utilized for materials processing on the lunar surface. These include heat from nuclear or electric sources and solar concentrators. Options for collecting and transporting thermal energy to processing reactors for each source are examined. Overall system requirements for each thermal source are compared and system limitations, such as maximum achievable temperature are discussed...|$|R
25|$|The Subaru Telescope is a Ritchey-Chretien {{reflecting}} telescope. Instruments can {{be mounted}} at a <b>Cassegrain</b> focus below the primary mirror; at either of two Nasmyth focal points in enclosures {{on the sides}} of the telescope mount, to which light can be directed with a tertiary mirror; or at the prime focus in lieu of a secondary mirror, an arrangement rare on large telescopes, to provide a wide field of view suited to deep wide-field surveys.|$|E
25|$|Off-axis or offset feed– The {{reflector}} is an asymmetrical {{segment of}} a paraboloid, so the focus, and the feed antenna, are located {{to one side}} of the dish. The purpose of this design is to move the feed structure out of the beam path, so it does not block the beam. It is widely used in home satellite television dishes, which are small enough that the feed structure would otherwise block a significant percentage of the signal. Offset feed can also be used in multiple reflector designs such as the <b>Cassegrain</b> and Gregorian, below.|$|E
25|$|The {{instrument}} {{was constructed in}} three phases. The first phase consisted of a 7-element 95nbsp&GHz array to demonstrate the technology. The second phase aims to mount a 91-element 95nbsp&GHz array (with 18nbsp&GHz bandwidth) and a 19-element 43nbsp&GHz array (with 8nbsp&GHz bandwidth) on 1.4nbsp&m <b>cassegrain</b> telescopes, mounted on what is currently the CBI platform. It is expected that these will start observing in 2008. The third phase aims to construct four further arrays by around 2010. Two of these will be at 43nbsp&GHz, with 91 elements each, {{and the other two}} will be at 95nbsp&GHz, with 397 elements each. These will then be mounted on three 2nbsp&m dishes on the CBI platform and the 7nbsp&m telescope.|$|E
40|$|Computerized SCTs, Maksutov-Cassegrains, and Meade's Ritchey-Chretiens {{have come}} to {{dominate}} the market. This guide offers guidance for amateurs considering {{the purchase of a}} new telescopeCatadioptric telescopes (CATs), such as the Schmidt <b>Cassegrains,</b> are increasingly popular with today’s amateur astronomers and are capable of showing even the novice observer thousands of beautiful deep space wonders. Modern CATs, though, have become increasingly reliant on computers. This allows them to automatically point to and track celestial objects, making astronomy more accessible to more people than ever before. Unfortunately, because of the high-tech nature of these telescopes, selecting one and learning how to use it is often a difficult experience for stargazers both old and new. That’s where Choosing and Using the New CAT comes in. This book guides even the most greenhorn astronomer past the pitfalls encountered on the path to enjoying the beauties and mysteries of the universe. Here you will learn not just which telescope is right for you but how to set up, operate, and maintain the most complex and electronics-laden CAT. There are plenty of tips for keeping the new CAT happy and working correctly, and there is even guidance on advanced applications, such as hooking computers to CATs and using these telescopes to take gorgeous pictures of planets and deep space objects. This book gives readers the benefit of the author’s thirty-five years experience using and enjoying catadioptric telescopes and solving the problems that inevitably crop up. If you dream of owning a telescope or are frustrated by the telescope you already own, this is the book for you...|$|R
500|$|In {{its most}} usual configuration, a [...] {{hyperbolic}} secondary mirror made of Zerodur {{is used to}} form a Ritchey Chretien f/11 <b>Cassegrain</b> system with a 15 arcmin field of view. An additional flat fold mirror allows {{the use of any}} one of two Nasmyth platforms or two folded <b>Cassegrain</b> stations, each with 5 arcmin fields of view. The telescope sometimes operates in a wide-field prime focus configuration, in which case the secondary is removed and a three element field-correcting lens inserted, which provides an effective f/2.8 focus with a 60 arcmin field of view (40 arcmin unvignetted). Changing between the <b>Cassegrain</b> and Nasmyth foci takes a matter of seconds and may be done during the night; switching to and from prime focus requires replacing the secondary mirror with a prime focus assembly during daytime (the two are mounted back-to-back) which takes around 30 minutes.|$|E
500|$|Targets {{picked out}} by the ZAR were then {{illuminated}} by the Zeus Discrimination Radar (ZDR, also known as Decoy Discrimination Radar, DDR or DR). ZDR imaged the entire cloud using a chirped signal that allowed the receiver to accurately determine range within the cloud by passing each frequency in the chirp to a separate range gate. The range resolution was 0.25 microseconds, about [...] As the signal was spread out over the entire cloud, {{it had to be}} very powerful; the ZDR produced 40MW 2µs pulses in the L-band between 1270–1400MHz. To ensure no signal was lost by scanning areas that were empty, the ZDR used a <b>Cassegrain</b> reflector that could be moved to focus the beam as the cloud approached to keep the area under observation constant.|$|E
500|$|The Context Camera (CTX) {{provides}} grayscale images (500 to 800nm) with a pixel resolution up {{to about}} [...] CTX {{is designed to provide}} context maps for the targeted observations of HiRISE and CRISM, and is also used to mosaic large areas of Mars, monitor a number of locations for changes over time, and to acquire stereo (3D) coverage of key regions and potential future landing sites. The optics of CTX consist of a [...] focal length Maksutov <b>Cassegrain</b> telescope with a 5,064 pixel wide line array CCD. The instrument takes pictures [...] wide and has enough internal memory to store an image [...] long before loading it into the main computer. The camera was built, and is operated by Malin Space Science Systems. CTX mapped 50% of Mars by February 2010. In 2012 it found the impacts of six 55-pound (25-kilogram) entry ballast masses from Mars Science Laboratory's landing of Curiosity rover.|$|E
2500|$|Important {{developments}} in reflecting telescopes were John Hadley's production of larger paraboloidal mirrors in 1721; {{the process of}} silvering glass mirrors introduced by Léon Foucault in 1857; [...] and the adoption of long-lasting aluminized coatings on reflector mirrors in 1932. The Ritchey-Chretien variant of <b>Cassegrain</b> reflector was invented around 1910, but not widely adopted until after 1950; many modern telescopes including the Hubble Space Telescope use this design, which gives a wider field of view than a classic <b>Cassegrain.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The three smaller domes {{on the top}} of the DDO {{administration}} building are used for smaller instruments. Soon after the observatory opened in 1935, a 50cm <b>Cassegrain</b> reflector telescope was installed in the southern dome. The [...] Cooke Refractor had been out of use since the Meteorological Office had given it to Hart House, but it was little used and was moved into the northern dome in 1951 to be used by undergraduates. Much later, in 1965, a similar 60cm <b>Cassegrain</b> was added to the central dome.|$|E
2500|$|A third form of {{reflecting}} telescope, the [...] "Cassegrain reflector" [...] was devised in 1672 by Laurent <b>Cassegrain.</b> The telescope {{had a small}} convex hyperboloidal {{secondary mirror}} placed near the prime focus to reflect light through a central hole in the main mirror.|$|E
2500|$|The Observatory is used {{primarily}} for undergraduate teaching. It has two main instruments, a 16" [...] <b>Cassegrain</b> (working at f/19) and a 14" [...] Meade LX200R (working at f/6.35). A third telescope is also present {{and is used}} exclusively for visual observations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{spacecraft}} used S-band for uplinked commands and downlinked telemetry, through dual redundant 5-watt transceivers. The spacecraft used X-band {{for science}} return (downlink only), using dual 20W TWTAs until {{the failure of}} the last remaining TWTA in January 2008. [...] Both bands used the dish antenna with prime-focus feeds, unlike the <b>Cassegrain</b> feeds of most other spacecraft dishes.|$|E
2500|$|Copley Science Center is {{the largest}} {{academic}} building on campus. [...] The biology, chemistry, physics/astrophysics, environmental studies, computer science, and mathematics departments are all located in Copley. [...] Copley Science Center was built {{as an extension of}} Smithey Hall, which today houses the psychology department. [...] Just north of Copley is Keeble Observatory, which includes a 12" [...] <b>Cassegrain</b> reflector optical telescope, and two radio telescopes.|$|E
2500|$|The idea {{of using}} {{parabolic}} reflectors for radio antennas was taken from optics, where {{the power of a}} parabolic mirror to focus light into a beam has been known since classical antiquity. [...] The designs of some specific types of parabolic antenna, such as the <b>Cassegrain</b> and Gregorian, come from similarly named analogous types of reflecting telescope, which were invented by astronomers during the 15th century.|$|E
2500|$|Putnam {{also played}} a major role in {{securing}} a new [...] telescope for the Observatory in 1961. Ohio Wesleyan University's Perkins Observatory in Delaware, Ohio, had a [...] <b>cassegrain</b> reflector telescope which was under-utilized due to poor viewing conditions and low elevation. Putnam led the negotiations which permanently moved the [...] telescope to Lowell Observatory's Anderson Mesa site (in Arizona). The telescope was operated by Lowell Observatory in partnership with the Ohio State University and Ohio Wesleyan, and purchased by Lowell in 1998.|$|E
2500|$|The feed antenna at the reflector's {{focus is}} {{typically}} a low-gain type {{such as a}} half-wave dipole or more often a small horn antenna called a feed horn. [...] In more complex designs, such as the <b>Cassegrain</b> and Gregorian, a secondary reflector is used to direct the energy into the parabolic reflector from a feed antenna located away from the primary focal point. [...] The feed antenna {{is connected to the}} associated radio-frequency (RF) transmitting or receiving equipment by means of a coaxial cable transmission line or waveguide.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1960s dish antennas became {{widely used}} in {{terrestrial}} microwave relay communication networks, which carried telephone calls and television programs across continents. [...] The first parabolic antenna used for satellite communications was constructed in 1962 at Goonhilly in Cornwall, England {{to communicate with the}} Telstar satellite. [...] The <b>Cassegrain</b> antenna was developed in Japan in 1963 by NTT, KDDI and Mitsubishi Electric. [...] The advent in the 1970s of computer design tools such as NEC capable of calculating the radiation pattern of parabolic antennas has {{led to the development of}} sophisticated asymmetric, multireflector and multifeed designs in recent years.|$|E
2500|$|Cassegrain– In a <b>Cassegrain</b> antenna, {{the feed}} {{is located on}} or behind the dish, and radiates forward, {{illuminating}} a convex hyperboloidal secondary reflector at {{the focus of the}} dish. The radio waves from the feed reflect back off the secondary reflector to the dish, which forms the outgoing beam. An advantage of this configuration is that the feed, with its waveguides and [...] "front end" [...] electronics {{does not have to be}} suspended in front of the dish, so it is used for antennas with complicated or bulky feeds, such as large satellite communication antennas and radio telescopes. Aperture efficiency is on the order of 65–70% ...|$|E
