5|$|Amanita nothofagi {{mushrooms}} can {{be confused}} with A.australis if the warts have been washed off and the colour has been bleached. A reliable method to distinguish the two is to <b>check</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> presence of clamp connections at the bases of the basidia, which are present in A.australis and absent from A.nothofagi. Ridley notes that the type collection was made with a dark grey specimen, and later collectors who found browner specimens have had difficulty in correctly identifying the species. Paler specimens resemble A.excelsa, which led some to incorrectly believe that the species occurs in New Zealand. Amanita luteofusca is also similar in appearance, spore size, amyloid reaction, and lack of clamp connections in the basidia. It is distinguished from A.nothofagi largely {{on the basis of}} colour—it is a greyish-brown to yellowish-grey brown that fades to pinkish-buff as it gets older. Tulloss suggests that the resemblance of a number of species from Australasia and Chile which lack brightly coloured fruit bodies and share similar greyish to brownish rings and volvas may indicate that they share Gondwanan ancestors.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Dana Scully finds black oil in de la Cruz's skull {{during an}} autopsy—the oil {{is dead and}} {{seems to have been}} irradiated. She concludes that he may have had some {{immunity}} to the black oil because he is a Huecha Indian, or an indigenous Mexican national. Doggett and Mulder find proof of black oil on the platform and quarantine it, but de la Cruz's friend Diego Garza is missing. Ortega threatens to bring back the crew unless the agents can provide proof of an infection. Doggett and Mulder search for Garza who, like de la Cruz, also has Native American heritage. Mulder and Doggett later discover that somebody has set fire to the communications room. As the agents tackle the fire, Garza attacks Doggett and renders him unconscious. When he awakens, Garza, now mentally unstable, cuts his arm to <b>check</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> presence of black oil.|$|E

25|$|Note {{that this}} {{negative}} being {{the same number}} is detected as an overflow condition since there was a carry into but {{not out of the}} most-significant bit. This can lead to unexpected bugs in that an unchecked implementation of absolute value could return a negative number {{in the case of the}} minimum negative. The abs family of integer functions in C typically has this behaviour. This is also true for Java.

25|$|By the {{concluding}} months of 1964 the conflict once again {{appeared to have}} reached stalemate, with Commonwealth forces having placed in <b>check</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> moment Indonesia's campaign of infiltrations into Borneo, and more recently, the Malaysian Peninsula. However, the fragile equilibrium looked likely to change once again in December 1964 when Commonwealth intelligence began reporting a build-up of Indonesian infiltration forces in Kalimantan opposite Kuching which suggested {{the possibility of an}} escalation in hostilities. Two additional British battalions were subsequently deployed to Borneo. Meanwhile, due to the landings in Malaysia and Indonesia's continued troop build-up, Australia and New Zealand also agreed to begin deploying combat forces to Borneo in early 1965.|$|E
25|$|Applications whose goal is {{to create}} a system that generalizes well to unseen examples, face the {{possibility}} of over-training. This arises in convoluted or over-specified systems when the capacity of the network significantly exceeds the needed free parameters. Two approaches address over-training. The first is to use cross-validation and similar techniques to <b>check</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> presence of over-training and optimally select hyperparameters to minimize the generalization error. The second is to use some form of regularization. This concept emerges in a probabilistic (Bayesian) framework, where regularization can be performed by selecting a larger prior probability over simpler models; but also in statistical learning theory, where the {{goal is to}} minimize over two quantities: the 'empirical risk' and the 'structural risk', which roughly corresponds to the error over the training set and the predicted error in unseen data due to overfitting.|$|E

25|$|This, however was not {{the first}} fish kill along the Kishwaukee and the city of DeKalb has been the {{location}} of {{more than half of the}} fish kills since 1954. Of the 19 documented fish kills since that year, 11 of them have occurred within DeKalb city limits. Another well documented fish kill along the Kishwaukee was in 1984. According to IDOC reports the 1984 fish kill and a number of others were in direct correlation with heavy canning activities at the Del Monte canning facility that once operated on Taylor Street in DeKalb. The 1984 fish kill affected a portion of the river from a bend north of Lucinda Avenue, near Annie's Woods to Lincoln Highway. IDOC gathered evidence that proved a faulty pipe at Del Monte was responsible for this particular fish kill. Del Monte cut the state a <b>check</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> value of lost fish and took steps to prevent a similar mishap after they found out they were culpable.|$|E
25|$|The Java class {{libraries}} serve three purposes {{within the}} Java platform. First, like other standard code libraries, the Java libraries provide the programmer a well-known {{set of functions}} to perform common tasks, such as maintaining lists of items or performing complex string parsing. Second, the class libraries provide an abstract interface to tasks that would normally depend heavily on the hardware and operating system. Tasks such as network access and file access are often heavily intertwined with the distinctive implementations of each platform. The java.net and java.io libraries implement an abstraction layer in native OS code, then provide a standard interface for the Java applications to perform those tasks. Finally, when some underlying platform does not support all of the features a Java application expects, the class libraries work to gracefully handle the absent components, either by emulation to provide a substitute, or at least by providing a consistent way to <b>check</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> presence of a specific feature.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} fiscal {{accounts for}} the previous full calendar year are released each year in April (next time 23 April 2015). As the compliance check for both the debt and deficit criteria always awaits this release in a new calendar year, the first possible month to request a compliance check will be April, which {{would result in a}} data <b>check</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> HICP and interest rates during the reference year from 1 April to 31 March. Any EU member state may also ask the European Commission to conduct a compliance check, at any point of time during the remainder of the year, with HICP and interest rates always checked for the past 12 months – while debt and deficit compliance always will be checked for the three-year period encompassing the last completed full calendar year and the two subsequent forecast years. As of 10 August 2015, none of the remaining euro derogation states without an opt-out had entered ERM-II, which makes it highly unlikely that any of them will request that the European Commission conduct an extraordinary compliance check ahead of the publication of the next regular convergence report scheduled June 2016.|$|E

25|$|Sulfates (SO4) in {{the soil}} or in groundwater, in {{sufficient}} concentration, can react with the Portland cement in concrete causing the formation of expansive products, e.g., ettringite or thaumasite, {{which can lead to}} early failure of the structure. The most typical attack of this type is on concrete slabs and foundation walls at grades where the sulfate ion, via alternate wetting and drying, can increase in concentration. As the concentration increases, the attack on the Portland cement can begin. For buried structures such as pipe, this type of attack is much rarer, especially in the eastern United States. The sulfate ion concentration increases much slower {{in the soil}} mass and is especially dependent upon the initial amount of sulfates in the native soil. A chemical analysis of soil borings to <b>check</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> presence of sulfates should be undertaken during the design phase of any project involving concrete in contact with the native soil. If the concentrations are found to be aggressive, various protective coatings can be applied. Also, in the US ASTM C150 Type 5 Portland cement can be used in the mix. This type of cement is designed to be particularly resistant to a sulfate attack.|$|E
25|$|No {{video game}} console {{manufacturer}} has allowed any game marked AO {{to be published}} in North America; however, the PC gaming service Steam has allowed AO titles such as Hatred to be published on its platform. No major retailers are willing to sell AO-rated games. However, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was rated AO after the presence of the Hot Coffee add-on became evident. The add-on was later removed and the game rated M. In the 109th Congress and 110th Congress, the Video Games Enforcement Act was introduced to the US House of Representatives. The act required an identification <b>check</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> purchase of M and AO rated games. The bill and others like it did not succeed because of likely First Amendment violations. Although no law mandates identification checking for games with adult content, a 2008 survey by the Federal Trade Commission showed that video game retailers have voluntarily increased ID verification for M- and AO-rated games, and sales of those games to underage potential buyers decreased from 83% in 2000 to 20% in 2008. A further survey in April 2011, found that video game retailers continued to enforce the ratings by allowing only 13% of underage teenage shoppers to buy M-rated video games, a statistically significant decrease from the 20% purchase rate in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{clinical}} genetics assessment is commonly {{performed by the}} high-risk obstetrician or genetic counselor where they may ask for a blood sample from the fetus or will perform an amniocentesis. These samples are used to perform several tests, one {{of which may be}} to <b>check</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> proper number of chromosomes, called a karyotype, of the fetus. Some birth defects are known to be associated with missing a chromosome, having an extra chromosome, such as in Down syndrome, as well as by having a part of one chromosome break off and relocate to a portion of another chromosome (called a translocation). However, on each of the 23 pairs of chromosomes are thousands of different genes. While chromosomes are easy to visualize under a microscope and count, the genes on them are not. Genes are very small pieces of DNA when compared to the chromosomes they reside on. A gene contains a code for a protein and if the gene is mutated (different from normal) the protein that is made from it may not function properly - if at all. Unfortunately, genetic abnormalities could still exist despite having normal chromosomes. The only way to determine genetically inherited mutations in the infant is to perform a genetic analysis of the mother, father, affected infant and any unaffected siblings of the affected fetus. These analyses will reveal what genetic mutations are present in the affected infant, and by comparing these results to the surviving siblings and parents, it can be determined which mutations were inherited or were not.|$|E
