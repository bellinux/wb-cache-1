6000|$|A {{few minutes}} before ten, <b>click-clack,</b> <b>click-clack,</b> gave notice of the {{approach}} of the post-horses. The porte-cochère opened, and two votaries of the old-fashioned boot enter, each riding one and leading another horse. All this is done quietly, {{and as a matter of}} course; the cattle are put before the carriage without a question being asked, and the two liveried roadsters place themselves by the sides of their respective beasts. In the mean time, we had entered the caleche, said adieu to the cook, who was left in charge of the apartment, a trust that might, however, equally well have been confided to the porter, kissed our hands to the family of M. de V----, and the other inmates of the hotel, who crowded the windows to see us off. Up to this moment, I had not decided even by what road to travel! The passport had been taken out for Brussels, and last year, you may recollect, we went to that place by Dieppe, Abbeville, Douay, and Arras. The [...] "Par quelle route, monsieur?" [...] of the postilion that rode the wheel-horse, who stood with a foot in the stirrup, ready to get up, brought me to a conclusion. [...] "A St. Denis!" [...] the question compelling a decision, and all my doubts terminating, as doubts are apt to terminate, by taking the most beaten path.|$|E

2500|$|... "Window Seat" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{criticism from}} most music critics. PopMatters writer Quentin B. Huff found Badu's vulnerability on the song comparable {{to her work}} on Mama's Gun (2000). Allmusic's Andy Kellman wrote that it [...] "should appeal {{to those who have}} wanted Badu to revisit that lissome sound of Baduizm songs like 'On & On' and 'Otherside of the Game,' and it packs stunning stomp-and-clap breakdowns that sync up with Badu's most halting lines". Embling of Tiny Mix Tapes called it [...] "as amniotic a slow jam as Badu has ever recorded". BBC Online writer Stevie Chick praised Badu's performance on the song, writing that she sings [...] "with such earnest, desperate yearning you’ll be struck dumb". The Washington Posts Chris Richards described the song as [...] "vintage Badu: gentle melodies, a twinkling harp, rim-shots <b>click-clacking</b> at an easy, Sunday morning tempo". Los Angeles Times writer Margaret Wappler praised co-producer and keyboardist James Poyser's contribution, writing that he [...] "elevates" [...] the song [...] "into a juicy slice of escapism but with the security of someone missing you back home". The Village Voices Pazz & Jop annual year-end critics' poll ranked [...] "Window Seat" [...] at number 11 to find the best music of 2010, tied with Arcade Fires [...] "Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)" [...] and LCD Soundsystems [...] "I Can Change".|$|R

60|$|They {{left her}} alone, but sleep was impossible. The tramp of feet, {{the sound of}} pianos, the slam of doors, the singing, {{laughing}} of the other boarders made sleep impossible. The cars jangled by, the <b>click-clack</b> of horses' hoofs and the swift rattle of wagons kept up long after the house was silent. Between midnight and four o'clock she got a little sleep, out of which she awoke while a booming, clattering wagon thundered by. Other wagons clattered viciously along up the alleys, and then some early riser below began to sing, and Rose wearily dressed and sat down by the window to listen.|$|E

6000|$|The life of each outfit was {{practically}} the same. At about 4.30 {{in the morning}} the campers awoke.

At about seven o'clock {{in the morning the}} outfits began to move. But here there was a difference of method. Most of them travelled for six or seven hours without unpacking, whereas our plan was to travel for four hours, rest from twelve to three, and pack up and travel four hours more. This difference in method resulted in our passing outfit after outfit who were unable to make the same distances by their one march.|$|E
60|$|Half-awake, Dane {{groped for}} the breastwork, falling over several negroes on the way, {{and when he}} reached it the {{blackness}} was Egyptian. There was nothing visible beyond the loom of shadowy trunks, but Dane could hear unseen men breathing heavily, the <b>click-clack</b> of flintlocks, and the rasp of a file along a matchet blade. Then a faint crackle which drew nearer {{came out of the}} grass, and instantly a blaze of weird blue radiance leaped up, showing Maxwell's spare figure perched recklessly aloft upon the breastwork with a port-fire held high above him. Its glare beat along the matchet blades, the gun-barrels, and the oily skin of the men beneath, and showed black patches which might have been arms or heads among the grass. Then it died out; and Dane pitched the rifle to his shoulder at Maxwell's shout. There was neither challenge nor parley. They were now beyond civilized jurisdiction, and the right of any man to existence in that country depends upon the strength of his hand.|$|E

5000|$|By 1903 the navaja {{had become}} a weapon of stealth, always {{concealed}} and [...] "never worn or used ostentatiously." [...] With the advent of mass-produced, low-priced handguns and an increasingly effective national police force, the Guardia Civil, the lock-blade navaja had become the weapon of choice of the lawless and the disreputable. While most of Spain {{at that time was}} about as safe as Victorian London, travel alone after dark was never advisable given occasional encounters with brigands and thieves. The ominous <b>click-clack</b> of a navaja de muelles was a sound dreaded by lone travellers attempting to negotiate lonely rural highways or the Byzantine back streets of medieval Spanish cities after dark.

40|$|A unique <b>click-clack</b> tin-lid {{mechanism}} is analyzed here. This mechanism {{has the feature}} to be switched between its two stable states by applying forces along different lines of action at two different points, called ports here. The 3 D <b>click-clack</b> tin-lid {{mechanism is}} modified to design a planar fully-compliant two-port bistable mechanism. By using the theory presented in this paper, a bistable mechanism can be designed to have a mechanical advantage. An analytical kinetoelastic model is used to explain the energy behavior of the mechanism and gain insights into applying it in practice. To account for varying loads experienced by the mechanism during switching, bistability is combined with static balancing. Such a mechanism is amenable {{to the design of}} an easy-chair to ease the suffering of arthritic and elderly users. Thus, a sit-to-stand easy-chair is designed where a small force applied on the armrest can gently propel and ease rising from it. Static balancing is implemented to partially compensate for the weight of the patient and to reduce the jerky motion arising from bistability. Furthermore, tuning parameters in static balancing enable adjustment for weights of different users of the chair. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
