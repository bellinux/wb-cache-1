40|$|Attrition through {{enforcement}} (ATE) {{was developed}} {{as a response to}} large-scale undocumented immigration to the United States over the last three decades. It is a twopronged approach to regulating undocumented immigration by decreasing the probability of securing employment in the United States while increasing the risk of detention and deportation. Each of these approaches is coercive, relying on increasing the threat of sanction as a <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> with law. Supporters of the doctrine argue that undocumented immigrants, as rational decision makers, will make the decision to self-deport in the face of increasing enforcement pressure, and that sufficient enforcement pressure can be established at low expense. When the systematic departures from rational decision-making described in prospect theory are applied to the migration decision, the expected cost-effectiveness of ATE is lower than in a rational model. This study concludes that where the assumption that undocumented immigrants are rational decision makers is unrealistic, it will generate an overoptimistic assessment of the capacity of coercive immigration policy to produce self-deportation. ...|$|R

40|$|Environmental impact {{assessment}} (EIA) is used globally {{to manage the}} impacts of development projects on the environment, so there is an imperative to demonstrate that it can effectively identify risky projects. However, despite {{the widespread use of}} quantitative predictive risk models in areas such as toxicology, ecosystem modelling and water quality, the use of predictive risk tools to assess the overall expected environmental impacts of major construction and development proposals is comparatively rare. A risk-based approach has many potential advantages, including improved prediction and attribution of cause and effect; sensitivity analysis; continual learning; and optimal resource allocation. In this paper we investigate the feasibility of using a Bayesian belief network (BBN) to quantify the likelihood and <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> <b>of</b> new projects based on the occurrence probabilities of a set of expert-defined features. The BBN incorporates expert knowledge and continually improves its predictions based on new data as it is collected. We use simulation to explore the trade-off between the number of data points and the prediction accuracy of the BBN, and find that the BBN could predict risk with 90 % accuracy using approximately 1000 data points. Although a further pilot test with real project data is required, our results suggest that a BBN is a promising method to monitor overall risks posed by development within an existing EIA process given a modest investment in data collection...|$|R

Second, due to variation of actions taken in the maintenance process, we analyze impact on cost and explore components affects on variation of maintenance cost. Empirical analysis was done by using Inspection and Maintenance data in year 2000 which collected at several auto-mechanic shops in Jakarta city. The bivariate probit model was applied to examine impact of chosen alternatives on the probability to pass Hydrocarbon and Carbon Monoxide in second emission test. To examine variation of maintenance cost and explore components affects on cost, multilevel approach was applied. It is confirm that several actions may increase probability to pass emission test but on the same time reduce average cost. Other actions may simultaneously increase probability to pass emission test and also increase cost. It was also found some actions didn`t have impact on emission test {{but on the other hand}} rise maintenance cost. Furthermore, some actions reduce probability to pass emission test but increase maintenance cost.

40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of this paper is}} to explore how some of the recent and future changes relating to the optometric profession could affect non-compliant behaviour among patients. Non-compliance has been widely documented and discussed in numerous health care fields and is understood to be the responsibility of both the practitioner and patient working in a health care partnership. At least one third of patients have been reported to be non-compliant with health care recommendations which can result in the poor outcome of a treatment, secondary medical problems, dissatisfaction, frustration and the wasting of health resources. In recent years contact lens complications have been linked with non-compliant behaviour with contact lens care and maintenance regimens which has led to several media scares over contact lens related hygiene risks and has heightened interest in the issue <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> in the field of optometry. Shared care schemes have already been adopted in some areas of the United Kingdom and if therapeutic pharmaceutical agents are introduced to the list of drugs permitted for use by optometrists in the future the issue <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> will become even more poignant.

40|$|This paper, while {{reviewing}} the legal authority held by clinical guidelines, examines the NICE head injury guidelines {{with respect to}} the likely <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance.</b> Conversely, the effect on medical practice of rigid adherence to guidelines is also explored. Debate about the appropriateness of NICE head injury guidelines has highlighted the extent to which existing practices will need to change if compliance is to be achieved. Although a degree of resistance remains, there is perhaps a sense of resignation that the management of patients with head injuries will follow nationally prescribed guidance, whether in its current form or following its review next June. There will undoubtedly be those who remain unconvinced of the validity of these guidelines. Despite this, a possible reason for compliance may arise from concerns about the consequences of non-conformity. With the aid of a fictional scenario, this article seeks to remind the reader of the legal authority held by guidelines, the likely <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> and the liability held by their authors should compliance result in an untoward outcome.

40|$|Objective Antidepressants are at best 50 – 55 % effective. Non-compliance and the {{antidepressant}} discontinuation syndrome (ADS) are causally related yet poorly appreciated. While ADS {{is associated}} with most antidepressants, agomelatine seems to be devoid of such risk. We review the neurobiology and clinical <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> antidepressant <b>non-compliance</b> and the ADS. Agomelatine {{is presented as a}} counterpoint to learn more on how ADS risk is determined by pharmacokinetics and pharmacology. Design The relevant literature is reviewed through a MEDLINE search via PubMed, focusing on agomelatine and clinical and preclinical research on ADS. Results Altered serotonergic dysfunction appears central to ADS so that how an antidepressant targets serotonin will determine its relative risk for inducing ADS and thereby affect later treatment outcome. Low ADS risk with agomelatine versus other antidepressants can be ascribed to its unique pharmacokinetic characteristics as well as its distinctive actions on serotonin, including melatonergic, monoaminergic and glutamatergic-nitrergic systems. Conclusions This review raises awareness of the long-term negative aspects <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> and inappropriate antidepressant discontinuation, and suggests possible approaches to “design-out” a risk for ADS.

40|$|Article 33 of Indonesia's Constitution {{requires}} {{the state to}} 'control' important branches of production and natural resources. The meaning of 'control' has {{been a matter of}} significant debate since Indonesia's independence: does it require the state to manage directly, or is regulation enough? The government has recently sought to break down government monopolies and attract private investment in key sectors. To this end it has enacted a raft of new statutes, but they have been challenged in Indonesia's new Constitutional Court. The Court has opted for the 'direct manage ment' interpretation of article 33, striking down statutes that implicitly interpret it as requiring government regulation only. This paper discusses these decisions and, more broadly, problems arising from judicial intervention in economic policy formation. It also considers how the government has sought to circumvent the decisions, and the possible <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> state <b>non-compliance</b> for the Court's future. ...|$|R

As long as SVHCs are used in articles, exposures and risks are real. ‘Safety improved, but consumers are not yet safe’ [18]. Therefore, the violation of SVHC provisions should not be regarded as trivial offence and must be prosecuted. A general absence <b>of</b> legal <b>consequences</b> in case <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> with the information duty is the wrong signal for companies who take their responsibility seriously, phase out SVHCs in their articles, and respond to all consumer requests.

40|$|The present {{research}} aims at measuring compliance with international standards on prison discipline in Belgium and France, {{in law and}} in practice. Hence, differences between the Belgian and French prison disciplinary regime are explored. The insights {{on the degree of}} both countries’ compliance with international standards are further discussed by researching the legal and policy implications of these violations of international law. This discussion focusses first on intrastate implications: what are the consequences when a state doesn’t comply with international standards within its own borders. The second analysis has an extrastate focus: the discussion is directed at the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> with international standards on prison discipline for cooperation in criminal matters within the EU. I. e., can EU member states swiftly extradite or transfer persons, or are poor or different detention conditions an impediment for EU cooperation? The research findings are based on an analysis of international and national legal instruments, policy documents and jurisprudence. These findings are complemented with an empirical research in seven prisons in Belgium and France. Data was gathered using methodological triangulation, mostly by studying prison disciplinary files, attending disciplinary hearings and interviewing detainees, prison officers and prison managers. The research findings show considerable differences between Belgium and France regarding their compliance with international standards on prison discipline. Furthermore, violations of these standards lead to a substantial deterioration of a prisoner’s legal status in prison. Legal <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> with international standards are limited however, both for the EU member state as such, as for cooperation between EU member states. Nevertheless, it becomes evident that EU policy in the area of cooperation in criminal matters lacks consistency and that there is an urgent need to reflect {{on the role of the}} EU in detention issues...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the strength (non) compliance of structural concretes produced in Brazil, and {{a study of the}} detrimental effects <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> in reliability <b>of</b> short columns subject to axial compression. The investigation is based on experimental results of over five thou-sand concrete samples from different parts of Brazil. Results show that a significant part of these concretes do not reach the characteristic strength specified in design. As a consequence, these concretes should be considered non-compliant, and mitigation measures should be adopted (de-sign revision, further testing, structural reinforcement, load restrictions and demolition/reconstruction). The study also investigates the impact <b>of</b> concrete strength <b>non-compliance</b> on the reliability of short columns subject to axial compression, when mitigation measures are not adopted. In reinforced concrete, short columns are the structural elements whose resistance most directly depends on the compressive strength <b>of</b> concrete. One <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> concrete strength <b>non-compliance</b> is that the theoretical equation relating mean concrete resistance to specified concrete strength does not apply. Using an alternative expression, derived from the experimental results, a significant reduction in reliability of short col-umns is observed, due to the noncompliance of concretes produced in Brazil. These results testify to the importance of a rigorous control in the reception of concretes at construction sites, {{as well as in the}} control of the required mitigation measures, when noncompliant concrete is received...|$|R
