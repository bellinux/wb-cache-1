50|$|There are {{a number}} of known causes of myopathy, and it is only once these have been ruled out that a {{clinician}} will assign an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) syndrome to a case. The usual criteria for a diagnosis of PM are weakness in muscles of the head, neck, trunk, upper arms or upper legs; raised blood serum concentrations of some muscle enzymes such as creatine kinase; unhealthy muscle changes on electromyography; and biopsy findings of (i) muscle cell degeneration and regeneration and (ii) chronic inflammatory infiltrates in muscle cells. If heliotrope (purple) rash or Gottron's papules are also present, then the diagnosis is DM. In DM, myositis may not be clinically apparent but detectable via biopsy or MRI. If the criteria for PM are met but muscle weakness also affects the hands and feet or is not accompanied by pain IBM should be suspected, and confirmed when muscle cell biopsy reveals (i) cytoplasmic vacuoles fringed by basophilic granules and (ii) inflammatory infiltrate comprising mostly <b>CD8</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> and macrophages; and electron microscopy reveals filamentous inclusions in both cytoplasm and nucleus.|$|R

Plasma cells and fibrosis increase in later stages with the former being numerous and prominent. Proteus and Escherichia coli are the most commonly involved bacteria in xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis.

50|$|IFNγ, or type II interferon, is a {{cytokine}} that {{is critical}} for innate and adaptive immunity against viral, some bacterial and protozoal infections. IFNγ is an important activator of macrophages and inducer of Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule expression. Aberrant IFNγ expression {{is associated with a}} number of autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The importance of IFNγ in the immune system stems in part from its ability to inhibit viral replication directly, and most importantly from its immunostimulatory and immunomodulatory effects. IFNγ is produced predominantly by natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells as part of the innate immune response, and by CD4 Th1 and <b>CD8</b> cytotoxic <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> (CTL) effector <b>T</b> cells once antigen-specific immunity develops. IFNγ is also produced by non-cytotoxic innate lymphoid cells (ILC), a family of immune cells first discovered in the early 2010's.|$|R

50|$|The main {{function}} of nRTKs is {{their involvement in}} signal transduction in activated T- and B-cells in the immune system. Signaling by many receptors is dependent on nRTKs including T-cell receptors (TCR), B-cell receptors (BCR), IL-2 receptors (IL-2R), Ig receptors, erythropoietin (EpoR) and prolactin receptors. CD4 and <b>CD8</b> receptors on <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> require for their signaling the Src family member Lck. When antigen binds to T-cell receptor, Lck becomes autophosphorylated and phosphorylates the zeta chain of the T-cell receptor, subsequently another nRTK, Zap70, binds to this T-cell receptor and then participates in downstream signaling events that mediate transcriptional activation of cytokine genes. Another Src family member Lyn is involved in signaling mediated by B-cell receptor. Lyn is activated by stimulation of B-cell receptor, {{which leads to the}} recruitment and phosphorylation of Zap70-related nRTK, Syk. Another nRTK, Btk, is also involved in signaling mediated by the B-cell receptor. Mutations in the Btk gene are responsible for X-linked agammaglobulinemia, a disease characterized by the lack of mature B-cells.|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> exert {{important}} homeostatic {{functions in}} the healthy intestinal mucosa, whereas in case of colorectal cancer (CRC), infiltration of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> into the tumor is crucial for an effective anti-tumor immune response. In both situations, the recruitment mechanisms of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> into the tissues are essential for the immunological functions deciding the outcome. The recruitment of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> is largely dependent on their expression of various chemokine receptors. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify potential chemokine receptors involved in the recruitment of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> to normal human colonic mucosa and to CRC tissue, respectively, by examining the expression of 16 different chemokine receptors on <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> isolated from these tissues. Methods: Tissues were collected from patients undergoing bowel resection for CRC. Lymphocytes were isolated through enzymatic tissue degradation of CRC tissue and nearby located unaffected mucosa, respectively. The expression of a broad panel of chemokine receptors on the freshly isolated <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> was examined by flow cytometry. Results: In the normal colonic mucosa, the frequencies of cells expressing CCR 2, CCR 4, CXCR 3, and CXCR 6 differed significantly between CD 4 + and CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> suggesting that the molecular mechanisms mediating <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> recruitment to the gut differ between CD 4 + and CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> In CRC, the frequencies of cells expressing CCR 2 and CXCR 5 were significantly lower in both the CD 4 + and CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> populations compared to unaffected colonic mucosa, and the frequency of CCR 9 + cytotoxic <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> was significantly decreased in CRC tissue. Conclusions: With regard to the normal gut mucosa, the results suggest that the molecular mechanisms mediating <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> recruitment differ between CD 4 + and CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> which are important for understanding gut homeostasis. Importantly, <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> from CRC compared to normal colonic tissue displayed a distinct chemokine receptor expression profile, suggesting that mechanisms for recruitment of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> to CRC tissue are skewed compared to normal colonic mucosa.
