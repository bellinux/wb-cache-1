60|$|A {{string of}} large pearls emerged from wrappings of tissue paper and <b>chamois</b> <b>skin.</b> Jim {{scarcely}} glanced at them.|$|E
60|$|From one pocket {{after another}} he {{continued}} bringing forth the spoil. There were many diamonds wrapped in <b>chamois</b> <b>skin</b> that were {{larger than those}} in the first handful. From one pocket he brought out a handful of very small cut gems.|$|E
60|$|Matt {{stepped to}} the food shelf behind the two-burner {{kerosene}} cooking stove. He emptied the tea from a paper bag, and from a second bag emptied some red peppers. Returning {{to the table with}} the bags, he put into them the two sizes of small diamonds. Then he counted the large gems and wrapped them in their tissue paper and <b>chamois</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Pavlova and Gloria leather {{works were}} major {{employers}} but both are now closed. Alfred Booth and Company of Liverpool traded with the Pavlova Leather Syndicate from 1860, bought {{a share in}} it in 1917-18 and took it over in 1921. In May 1947 at the annual British Industries Fair in Birmingham, Pavlova advertised doe <b>skins,</b> <b>chamois,</b> lambskins and goatskins, {{much of it as}} suede, for uses including shoes, gloves and belts. In 1958 Pavlova's site covered 35 acre, employed neary 200 people and included a staff sports field. At that time its factory still processed imported skins of sheep, lamb and goat, mainly to make suede. Garner group took over the Booth group in 1979 and became Garner Booth. Pittards plc took over Garner Booth in 1987 and became Pittard Garner. It closed the Pavlova works in 1993.|$|R
40|$|International audienceScabies is a {{major threat}} to the well being of mountain-dwelling Bovid hosts, Rupicapra rupicapra and Rupicapra pyrenaica. Severe {{outbreaks}} are in progress over a significant part of their distribution area and resource managers demand improved methods to monitor, analyse and possibly forecast the spread and effects of scabies at the population level. An amplified capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed to detect antibodies to Sarcoptes scabiei in chamois (Rupicapra spp.) serum. The method used the biotin-avidin amplification system and was validated on a panel of 144 serum samples, of which 40 were obtained from scabietic and 104 from healthy unexposed individuals originating from a scabies-free area. The antigen, a whole body extract of the various developmental stages of S. scabiei, was prepared from mites actively leaving the skin lesions of naturally infested red foxes (Vulpes vulpes). The resulting LAB-ELISA was characterised by 93 % sensitivity, 97 % specificity and a high degree of repeatibility. A single seroreactor was found amongst 32 <b>chamois</b> affected with <b>skin</b> pathologies other than scabies, including infestations by other Acarina (Trombicula spp. and Ixodid ticks). Antibodies to S. scabiei were present in 26 out of 169 sera (15. 4 %) obtained by clinically healthy chamois within a scabies outbreak area, indicating that asymptomatic infestations by S. scabiei can be revealed by serological methods in the studied Caprinae hosts...|$|R
60|$|It {{is rather}} a {{discouraging}} reflection {{that one should}} travel {{three or four hours}} to get to such a desolate place as these mountain tops generally are; nothing but grass, rocks, and snow; a shanty, with a show case full of minerals, articles of carved wood, and engravings of the place for sale. In these show cases the Alps are brought to market as thoroughly as human ingenuity can do the thing. The chamois figures largely; there are pouches made of <b>chamois</b> <b>skin,</b> walking sticks and alpenstocks tipped with chamois horn; sometimes an entire skin, horns and all, hanging disconsolately downward. Then all manner of crystals, such as are found in the rocks, are served up--agate pins, rings, seals, bracelets, cups, and snuffboxes--all which are duly urged on your attention; so, instead of falling into a rapture at the sight of Mont Blanc, the regular routine for a Yankee is to begin a bargain for a walking stick or a snuffbox.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, a buffing {{cream and}} <b>chamois</b> <b>skin</b> have been used. Modern {{instruments}} {{are much more}} efficient and are similar in appearance to a large rubber eraser, with different sides for different levels of coarseness. As buffing is gentle surface abrasion, {{it should not be}} performed too strongly or too often or thinning of the nail may result.|$|E
50|$|A {{suitably}} sized <b>chamois</b> <b>skin</b> is soaked in clean fuel and {{placed over the}} grid in the funnel and brought up the sides, forming a bowl, to prevent any leakage past the skin. Fuel can then be pumped {{into the top of}} the funnel by the fuel dispenser and watched for signs of water accumulation. The process can be stopped to lift out the assembly from the tank and the trapped water removed so that the job can be continued. Chamois leather is used thus as a fuel filter by boaters, auto detailers—and aircraft refuellers, particularly of a past age when aircraft were flown into very remote areas.|$|E
50|$|The cap is {{initially}} convex when young, but in maturity flattens out, usually with a shallow central depression. It is white or light gray or yellow, sticky when moist, and 3 to 10 cm in diameter with a characteristic feel {{to the touch}} of <b>chamois</b> <b>skin.</b> The gills are decurrent in attachment to the stipe, spaced together rather closely, and whitish, although they often develop a pinkish hue in age. The stipe is 3 to 8 cm long × 4-15 mm thick, and white. This mushroom has a mealy odor, somewhat like cucumber. The spore print is pink. Spores are 9-12 × 5-6.5 µm. C. prunulus may be found growing {{on the ground in}} hardwood and coniferous woods in the summer and fall.|$|E
5000|$|With time, {{landowners and}} their employees, {{starting}} with {{those living in}} the Mexican Plateau and later {{the rest of the}} country, adapted their cowboy style to better fit the Mexican terrain and temperature, evolving away from the Spanish style of cattle raising. After the Mexican War of Independence, horse riding exploded in popularity. Many men became mercenaries, messengers and workers in plantations. The most successful of these were those of mixed race who could act as middlemen of the lighter skinned Spanish people and the darker skinned indigenous tribes of the area. Better known as Chinacos, these men became distinguished during the independence war but later became the modern [...] "vaqueros". Rich plantation owners would often dress themselves and their horses in clothing that portrayed their status in the community. The poorer riders would also dress their horses in clothing made from agave or would border their saddles with <b>chamois</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E
