25|$|Melamine {{may have}} been added to fool {{government}} protein content tests after water was added to fraudulently dilute the milk. Because of melamine's high nitrogen content (66% by mass versus approx. 10–12% for typical protein), it can cause the protein content of food to appear higher than the true value. Officials estimate that about 20 percent of the dairy companies tested in China sell products tainted with melamine.

2500|$|Given the {{similarity}} with the Gospel, the [...] "great majority" [...] of critical scholars assign the same authorship to the epistle that they assign to the Gospel. [...] At {{the end of}} the 19th century, scholar Ernest DeWitt Burton was able to write that, [...] "{{the similarity}} in style, vocabulary and doctrine to the fourth gospel is, however, so clearly marked {{that there can be no}} reasonable doubt that the letter and the gospel are from the same pen." [...] Starting with Heinrich Julius Holtzmann, however, and continuing with C. H. Dodd, some scholars have maintained that the epistle and the gospel were written by different authors. [...] There are at least two principal arguments for this view. The first is that the epistle often uses a demonstrative pronoun at the beginning of a sentence, then a particle or conjunction, followed by an explanation or definition of the demonstrative at {{the end of the}} sentence, a stylistic technique which is not used in the gospel. The second is that the author of the epistle, [...] "uses the <b>conditional</b> <b>sentence</b> in a variety of rhetorical figures which are unknown to the gospel." ...|$|E

[...] The requirements or conditions may include mandatory programs such as a drug or alcohol treatment seminars, curfews, house arrest, or electronic monitoring. [...] Most offenders who receive conditional sentences are low risk and are usually serving time for impaired driving where no death occurred. When an offender receives a <b>conditional</b> <b>sentence</b> of home confinement in comparison to incarceration, the offender is still able to see family members, maintain a normal job, and attend school. This is a huge advantage to conditional sentencing, since offenders are not completely cut off from the external world. [...] Although the offender is not locked away in a prison cell, the offender is still expected to stay at home during certain times of the day or night. [...] In order to verify that offenders are abiding by the restrictions placed on them, electronic monitoring is often used. The development of GPS, which allows law enforcement agencies to know the exact location of the offender by the use of satellites, has increased the effectiveness of offenders serving home confinement sentences drastically. Offenders can now easily be identified and tracked down through the use of GPS allowing law enforcement officers to quickly move in to make an arrest when an offender is in breach of their conditions.|$|E

The <b>conditional</b> <b>sentence</b> may be combined with day fines and/or an obligation to perform community service. There is no check made as to whether the person sentenced has conducted himself in an acceptable manner; but if the person is found to conduct himself in an unacceptable manner, the court may issue a warning, change a provision, or decide that the <b>conditional</b> <b>sentence</b> should be replaced by another sanction.|$|E
50|$|An {{accused person}} may be arrested without warrant where a peace officer {{believes}} on reasonable grounds that the accused has failed {{to comply with a}} condition or by warrant. An accused arrested for an alleged breach will be detained in custody pending a hearing to determine whether a breach occurred. The accused may apply for bail pending the hearing. However, under subsection 515(6) the accused bears the onus. Upon the earliest of the accused being arrested for an alleged breach or upon the issuance of a warrant, the <b>conditional</b> <b>sentence</b> stops running. At a breach hearing the Crown bears the onus to prove a breach on a balance of probabilities. If the court finds that a breach occurred, the accused bears to onus to justify the continuation of the <b>conditional</b> <b>sentence.</b> The court may do one of four things: take no action, order that the accused serve a portion of the <b>conditional</b> <b>sentence</b> in custody, terminate the <b>conditional</b> <b>sentence</b> and order that the accused serve the remainder of the <b>conditional</b> <b>sentence</b> in custody or change a condition of the order.|$|E
50|$|A <b>conditional</b> <b>sentence</b> is a carceral sentence. However, {{the accused}} is ineligible for remission. Typically accused persons sentenced to custody {{are given a}} one-day {{reduction}} for every two days served, provided the accused is of good behaviour and follows the institutional rules (see sec. 6 of the Prisons and Reformatories Act). This results {{in the vast majority}} of accused persons serving two thirds of their sentence. Therefore, where the conditions of the <b>conditional</b> <b>sentence</b> resemble incarceration (e.g. a conditional requiring the accused person to reside in a secure psychiatric hospital), the <b>conditional</b> <b>sentence</b> may actually be more harsh than a carceral sentence (i.e. a two year <b>conditional</b> <b>sentence</b> which is effectively served in an institution is equivalent to a three year prison sentence since a person sentenced to three years would be eligible for mandatory release after two thirds of the sentence).|$|E
