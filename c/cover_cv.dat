Vegetation <b>cover</b> (<b>CV)</b> was determined by a survey of vegetation and composition of diets using a micro histological technique of feces (50 guanacos, 35 cows and 25 horses). The dietary overlap was determined by Horn Index (I), food preferences by Ivlev index (E) and the diet diversity by Shannon-Weaver index (D). We found a low - moderate food competition between the guanaco and the cattle and horses. The dietary overlap was greater during the rainy season (I= 0. 80 and 0. 88) where forage supply was high (CV= 63 %) and lower during the dry season (R= 0. 58 and 0. 64) when there were shortages of food (CV= 50 %). The guanaco was an intermediate selective consumer. The dietary diversity of adults increased during the dry season (D= 0. 62, p 60 %) and did not show the same flexibility (I= 0. 90, p 60 %) y no mostró la misma flexibilidad (I= 0. 90, p< 0. 01).

40|$|Since {{the launch}} of sensors with angular {{observation}} capabilities, such as CHRIS and MISR, the additional potential of multi-angular observations for vegetation structural and biochemical variables has been widely recognised. Various methods have been successfully implemented to estimate forest biochemical and biophysical variables from atmospherically-corrected multi-angular data, {{but the use of}} physically based radiative transfer (RT) models is still limited. Because both canopy and atmosphere have an anisotropic behaviour, {{it is important to understand}} the multi-angular signal measured by the sensor at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). Coupled canopy–atmosphere RT models allow linking surface variables directly to the TOA radiance measured by the sensor and are therefore very interesting tools to use for estimating forest variables from multi-angular data. We investigated the potential of TOA multi-angular radiance data for estimating forest variables by inverting a coupled canopy–atmosphere physical RT model. The case study focussed on three Norway spruce stands located at the Bily Kriz experimental site (Czech Republic), for which multi-angular CHRIS and field data were acquired in September 2006. The soil–leaf–canopy RT model SLC and the atmospheric model MODTRAN 4 were coupled using a method allowing to make full use of the four canopy angular reflectance components provided by SLC. The TOA radiance simulations were in good agreement with the spectral and angular signatures measured by CHRIS. Singular value decompositions of the Jacobian matrices showed that the dimensionality of the variable estimation problem increased from 3 to 6 when increasing the number of observation angles from 1 to 4. The model inversion was conducted for two cases: 4 and 7 variables. The most influential parameters were chosen as free variables in the look-up tables, namely: vertical crown <b>cover</b> (<b>Cv),</b> fraction of bark material (fB), needle chlorophyll content (needleCab), needle dry matter content (needleCdm) for the 4 -variable case, and additionally, tree shape factor (Zeta), dissociation factor (D), and needle brown pigments content (needleCs) in the 7 -variable case. All angular combinations were tested, and the best estimates were obtained with combinations using two or three angles, depending on the number of variables and on the stand used. Overall, this case study showed that, although making use of its full potential is still a challenge, TOA multi-angular radiance data do have a higher potential for variable estimation than mono-angular data...|$|E

40|$|Vegetation is an {{important}} component of the Earth’s biosphere and therefore plays a crucial role in the carbon exchange of terrestrial ecosystems. Vegetation variables, such as leaf area index (LAI) and leaf chlorophyll content (Cab), can be monitored at global scale using remote sensing (RS). There are two main categories of approaches for estimating the vegetation variables from RS data: empirical and physically-based approaches. Physically-based approaches are more widely applicable because they rely on radiative transfer (RT) models, which can be adapted to the observation conditions and to the observed vegetation. For estimating the vegetation variables, however, the RT model has to be inverted, and this inversion is usually an ill-posed and under-determined problem. Several regularization methods have been proposed to allow finding stable and unique solutions: model coupling, using multi-angular data, using a priori information, as well as applying spatial or temporal constraints. Traditionally, radiance data measured at top-of the atmosphere (TOA) are pre-processed to top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectances. Corrections for atmospheric effects, and, if needed, for adjacency, directional, or topographic effects are usually applied sequentially and independently. Physically, however, these effects are inter-related, and each correction introduces errors. These errors propagate to the TOC reflectance data, which are used to invert the canopy RT model. The performance of the TOC approach is therefore limited by the errors introduced in the data during the pre-processing steps. This thesis proposes to minimize these errors by directly using measured TOA radiance data. In such a TOA approach, the atmospheric RT model, which is normally inverted to perform the atmospheric correction, is coupled to the canopy RT model. The coupled canopy-atmosphere model is inverted directly using the measured radiance data. Adjacency, directional and topographic effects can then be included in the coupled RT model. The same regularization methods as used for TOC approaches can be applied to obtain stable and unique estimates. The TOA approach was tested using four case studies based on mono-temporal data. A) The performance of the TOA approach was compared to a TOC approach for three Norway spruce stands in the Czech Republic, using near-nadir Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) data. The coupled model included canopy directional effects and simulated the CHRIS radiance data with similar accuracy as the canopy model simulated the atmospherically-corrected CHRIS data. Local sensitivity analyses showed that the atmospheric parameters had much less influence on the simulations than the vegetation parameters, and that the sensitivity profiles of the latter were very similar for both TOC and TOA approaches. The dimensionality of the estimation problem was evaluated to be 3 for both approaches. Canopy <b>cover</b> (<b>Cv),</b> fraction of bark material (fB), Cab, and leaf dry matter content (Cdm) were estimated using look-up tables (LUT) with similar accuracy with both approaches. B) Regularization using multi-angular data was tested for the TOA approach, using four angular CHRIS datasets, for the same three stands as used in A). The coupled model provided good simulations for all angles. The dimensionality increased from 3 to 6 when using all four angles. Two LUTs were built for each stand: a 4 -variable LUT with fB, Cv, Cdm, and Cab, and a 7 -variable LUT where leaf brown pigment concentration (Cs), dissociation factor (D), and tree shape factor (Zeta) were added. The results did not fully match the expectation that the more angles used, the more accurate the estimates become. Although their exploitation remains challenging, multi-angular data have higher potential than mono-angular data at TOA level. C) A Bayesian object-based approach was developed and tested on at-sensor Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) radiance data for an agricultural area in Switzerland. This approach consists of two steps. First, up to six variables were estimated for each crop field object using a Bayesian optimization algorithm, using a priori information. Second, a LUT was built for each object with only LAI and Cab as free variables, thus spatially constraining the values of all other variables to the values obtained in the first step. The Bayesian object-based approach estimated LAI more accurately than a LUT with a Bayesian cost function approach. This case study relied on extensive field data allowing defining the objects and a priori data. D) The Bayesian object-based approach proposed in C) was applied to a simulated TOA Sentinel- 2 scene, covering the area around Zurich, Switzerland. The simulated scene was mosaicked using seven APEX flight lines, which allowed including all spatial and spectral characteristics of Sentinel- 2. Automatic multi-resolution segmentation and classification of the vegetated objects in four levels of brightness in the visible domain enabled defining the objects and a priori data without field data, allowing successful implementation of the Bayesian object-based approach. The research conducted in this thesis contributes to the improvement of the use of regularization methods in ill-posed RT model inversions. Three major areas were identified for further research: 1) inclusion of adjacency and topography effects in the coupled model, 2) addition of temporal constraints in the inversion, and 3) better inclusion of observation and model uncertainties in the cost function. The TOA approach proposed here will facilitate the exploitation of multi-angular, multi-temporal and multi-sensor data, leading to more accurate RS vegetation products. These higher quality products will support many vegetation-related applications...|$|E

The objective was to study the effect of milling on the levels of total dietary fibre (TDF) and â-glucans in milling fractions of covered and naked cultivars of oat and assess hypocholesterolemic effects of these fractions in rats with induced hypercholesterolemia. The material was whole grain of oats (<b>covered</b> <b>cv.</b> Kasztan, dehulled; naked cv. Akt) and their milling fractions: flour and bran. Total dietary fibre (TDF=IDF+SDF) and â-glucans were determined using the Megazyme assay kits. Three groups of Wistar rats (BM 100 ± 3 g), 42 rats each, were used in three 21 d consecutive experiments. The animals were fed hypercholesterolemic (1 % cholesterol) diets (Pisulewski et al. 2002), formulated with increasing amounts of TDF (Exp. 1 : control vs. whole grain 2, 4, 6 %; Exp. 2 : control vs. flour 1, 2, 3 %; Exp. 3 : control vs. bran 2, 4, 6 %). The animals were bled to determine serum total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and triacylglycerols (TG). Processing of oat grain (covered and naked forms) results in substantial losses of TDF, including serum cholesterol-lowering â- glucans, thus resulting in TDF- and â-glucan-reach bran and functionally inferior flour. Consequently, only TDF- and â-glucan-reach whole grain and bran exerted hypocholesterolemic effects in rats. No such effects were noted for flour fraction. Pisulewski, P. M., et al. 2002.

The objective was to study the effect of milling on the levels of total polyphenols in milling fractions of covered and naked cultivars and assess antioxidant potential of these fractions in vitro and in rats with induced hypercholesterolemia. The material was whole grain of oats (<b>covered</b> <b>cv.</b> Kasztan, dehulled; naked cv. Akt) and their milling fractions: flour and bran. Total polyphenols were extracted and determined to measure total radical scavenging activity (RSA%) (Pekarinen et al. 1999). Three groups of Wistar rats (BM 100 ± 3 g), 42 rats each, were used in three 21 d consecutive experiments. The animals were fed hypercholesterolemic (1 % cholesterol) diets (Pisulewski et al. 2002), formulated with increasing amounts of total dietary fibre (Exp. 1 : control vs. whole grain 2, 4, 6 %; Exp. 2 : control vs. flour 1, 2, 3 %; Exp. 3 : control vs. bran 2, 4, 6 %). The animals were bled to determine serum lipid peroxides using the Kamiya Biomedical assay kit (no CC- 004). Processing of oat grain (covered and naked forms) leads to substantial losses of total polyphenols as indicated by their highest concentration in bran. Consequently, bran showed the highest RSA (%) values. At the same time, the flour fraction with a relatively low content of total polyphenols and related low RSA (%) values was most efficient in reducing serum lipid peroxides in hypercholesterolemic rats.

Both telescopes are located on La Palma. We concentrated our WHT search on nova-like variables, whilst our IPHAS search <b>covered</b> all <b>CVs</b> in the IPHAS footprint. We found one shell out of the 24 nova-like variables we examined. The newly discovered shell is around V 1315 Aql and has a radius of ∼ 2. 5 [*]arcmin, indicative of a nova eruption approximately 120 yr ago. This result is consistent with the idea that the high mass-transfer rate exhibited by nova-like variables is due to enhanced irradiation of the secondary by the hot white dwarf following a recent nova eruption. The implications of our observations for the lifetime of the nova-like variable phase are discussed. We also examined four asynchronous polars, but found no new shells around any of them, so we are unable to confirm that a recent nova eruption is the cause of the asynchronicity in the white dwarf spin. We find tentative evidence of a faint shell around the dwarf nova V 1363 Cyg.

Methods: Ten healthy subjects completed an incremental test to volitional exhaustion followed by four constant-velocity runs on a treadmill for the determination of CV and D`, as well as an all-out 3 -minute test on a track for the determination of end-test velocity (EV) and the distance above end-test velocity (DEV). Eight of the eleven subjects completed a second 3 -minute test and one run each at (+) and (-) 95 % confidence interval velocities of CV determined from the 1 /time model. Results: The group mean 1 /time model CV (12. 8 ± 2. 5 km·h[superscript]- 1) was significantly greater than the velocity-time model CV (12. 3 ± 2. 4 km·h[superscript]- 1; P 0. 05), which demonstrated a reliability coefficient of 0. 85 for EV and 0. 32 for DEV.

Autumn-sown reproductive and younger, spring-sown plants of 2 drought-resistant cultivars, contrasting for summer dormancy, were established and then tested in summer 2002 under long drought, drought + midsummer storm, or full irrigation. The autumn-sown reproductive plants of cv. Kasbah were summer dormant under all moisture regimes and exhibited the characteristic traits including growth cessation, rapid herbage senescence, and dehydration of surviving organs (- 6. 7 MPa). Cultivar Kasbah used 8 % less soil water over the summer and also began to rehydrate its leaf bases from conserved soil water before the drought broke. The non-dormant cv. Medly grew for 10 days longer under drought and whenever moisture was applied; Medly also responded to the storm with a decline in dehydrin expression in leaf bases, whereas no decline occurred in Kasbah, presumably because it remained dormant and therefore much drier. The irrigated, younger, spring-sown swards of cv. Kasbah had restrained growth and produced only about 25 % of the herbage of cv. Medly. Drought reduced activity and growth of young plants of both cultivars, but whereas Medly regrew {{in response to the}} storm, cv. Kasbah did not, indicating that dormancy, although only partially expressed after spring sowing, was reinforced by summer drought.

Lolium arundinaceum), we tested the response of 2 cultivars of differing dormancy expression and growth stage {{to a range of}} summer moisture conditions, including full irrigation, drought, and a simulated mid-summer storm and analysed whether traits associated with summer dormancy conferred better survival under severe field drought. Autumn-sown reproductive and younger, spring-sown plants of 2 cultivars, claimed to exhibit contrasting summer dormancy, were established and then tested in summer 2002 under either long drought, drought+ simulated mid-summer storm, or full irrigation. The autumn-sown reproductive plants of cv. Flecha exhibited traits that can be associated with partial summer dormancy since under summer irrigation they reduced aerial growth significantly and exhibited earlier herbage senescence. Moreover, cv. Flecha used 35 % less soil water over the first summer. However, the water status of leaf bases of young vegetative tillers of both cultivars was similar under irrigation and also throughout most of the drought (leaf potential and water content maintained over - 4 MPa and at approx. 1 g H 2 O/g DM, respectively). The summer-active cv. Demeter did not stop leaf elongation even in drought and produced twice as much biomass as Flecha under irrigation. Cultivar Demeter responded to the simulated storm with a decline in dehydrin expression in leaf bases, whereas no decline occurred in Flecha, presumably because it remained partially dormant. The younger, spring-sown swards of both cultivars had similar biomass production under summer irrigation but whereas Demeter regrew in response to the simulated storm, cv. Flecha did not, indicating that dormancy, although only partially expressed, was reinforced by summer drought. In all trials, cv. Flecha out-yielded Demeter in autumn regrowth. In particular, the severe drought in 2003 caused a 25 % loss of the basal <b>cover</b> in <b>cv.</b> Demeter, whereas Flecha fully maintained its sward allowing it to produce a higher post-drought autumn yield.
