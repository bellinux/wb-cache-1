5|$|After a varying {{amount of}} {{training}} (at {{least a few}} months), apprentices are eventually made warriors. Another naming ceremony is held, this time to mark the cat as being a full member of the Clan. Warriors are given their own unique suffix that often marks their personality or appearance; for example, ‘Graystripe’ would be named after the grey stripe running down his back, ‘Brokentail’ after the kink in his tail, and ‘Sandstorm’ after her fiery personality. It is extremely rare for warriors to meet another <b>cat</b> <b>with</b> the exact same name, but often a warrior will meet another <b>cat</b> <b>with</b> the same first part of their name, and very often will a warrior meet another <b>cat</b> <b>with</b> the same last part of their name (such as fur, tail, or heart). Once named, warriors hold a vigil at night to protect the clan, {{while the rest of}} the clan is sleeping. After the vigil, warriors are free to move into the warrior’s den, where the majority of the Clan sleeps. The duty of a warrior is to protect and uphold their Clan at all costs. They are able to hunt by themselves, and are generally skilled at defending themselves in battle. Warriors can take a mate, and females can give birth to new kits; if this occurs, the expecting mother, known as a 'queen', will avoid warrior duties for six months before returning to them once her kits are made apprentices. The vast majority of warriors are also chosen to later be mentors to new apprentices. Warriors will remain in this position for the remainder of their life, or until they are old enough to retire.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} (DKA) {{has long}} been considered a key clinical feature of type- 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) in humans although. An increasing {{number of cases of}} ketoacidosis have been reported in people with type- 2 DM. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: <b>Cats</b> initially diagnosed <b>with</b> DKA can achieve remission from diabetes. <b>Cats</b> <b>with</b> DKA and diabetic remission {{are more likely to have}} been administered glucocorticoids before diagnosis. ANIMALS: Twelve <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> DKA and 7 <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> uncomplicated DM. METHODS: Retrospective case review. Medical records of <b>cats</b> presenting <b>with</b> DKA or DM were evaluated. Diabetic remission was defined as being clinically unremarkable for at least 1 month after insulin withdrawal. The cats were assigned to 1 of 3 groups: (1) <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> DKA and diabetic remission; (2) <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> DKA without diabetic remission; and (3) <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> DM and diabetic remission. RESULTS: Seven <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> DKA had remission from diabetes. These cats had significantly higher concentrations of leukocytes and segmented neutrophils, and significantly lower concentrations of eosinophils in blood and had pancreatic disease more often than did <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> uncomplicated DM and diabetic remission. With regard to pretreatment, 3 / 7 cats in group 1, 1 / 5 cats in group 2, and 1 / 7 cats in group 3 had been treated with glucocorticoids. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Remission of DM in <b>cats</b> presenting <b>with</b> DKA is possible. <b>Cats</b> <b>with</b> DKA and remission have more components of a stress leucogram, pancreatic disease, and seemed to be treated more often <b>with</b> glucocorticoids than <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> uncomplicated DM and diabetic remission...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Cats</b> <b>with</b> {{feline leukemia virus}} (FeLV) –associated {{enteritis}} (FAE), enteritis {{of other}} known viral etiology (parvovirus [PV], enteric coronavirus [CoV]), and enteritis of unknown etiology with histologic features {{similar to those of}} FAE and PV enteritis (EUE) and FeLV-negative and FeLV-positive cats without enterocyte alterations were examined. Amount and types of infiltrating leukocytes in the jejunum and activity and cellular constituents of mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow were determined. PV and CoV infections were confirmed by immunohistologic demonstration of PV and CoV antigen, ultrastructural demonstration of viral particles in the intestinal content, and in situ hybridization for PV genome. FeLV infection was detected by immunohistology for gp 70, p 27, and p 15 E. Latent FeLV infection was excluded by polymerase chain reaction methods for exogenous FeLV DNA. Enterocyte lesions involved the crypts in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> PV enteritis, FAE, and EUE and the villous tips in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> CoV enteritis. Inflammatory infiltration was generally dominated by mononuclear cells and was moderate in the unaltered intestine and in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> PV enteritis and marked in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> FAE, CoV enteritis, and EUE. In <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> EUE, myeloid/histiocyte antigen-positive macrophages were relatively numerous, suggesting recruitment of peripheral blood monocytes. Lymphoid tissues were depleted in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> PV enteritis and with EUE but were normal or hyperplastic in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> FAE. Bone marrow activity was decreased in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> PV enteritis; in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> FAE or EUE and in FeLV-positive cats without enterocyt...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate serum cystatin C (sCysC) and urinary cystatin C (uCysC) in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> hyperthyroidism and <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Methods: Thirty <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> FIV, 26 hyperthyroid cats and 28 healthy cats were included. sCysC and uCysC:creatinine (uCysC/uCr) ratio were measured with a human particle-enhanced nephelometric immunoassay, previously validated for feline CysC measurement. Routine renal variables (serum creatinine [sCr], urine specific gravity, urinary protein:creatinine ratio [UPC]) were also measured in the three groups. Results: <b>Cats</b> <b>with</b> hyperthyroidism had significantly higher sCysC and higher uCysC/uCr ratio, lower sCr and a higher UPC than healthy <b>cats.</b> <b>Cats</b> <b>with</b> FIV infection did not show a significantly higher sCysC concentration but had a significantly higher sCr and UPC than healthy cats. uCysC could be detected in only four of them. Conclusions and relevance: This study demonstrated that sCysC is increased in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> hyperthyroidism, in contrast with sCr, but not in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> FIV. Many hyperthyroid cats, but only four <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> FIV, had an elevated uCysC/uCr ratio. Further studies may reveal if uCysC might be a valuable marker for tubular dysfunction in cats...|$|R
5|$|The best {{documented}} {{account of}} these hauntings occurred between 1968 and 1970. The Evening Herald and Evening Press newspapers carried a number of reports regarding a Mrs Margaret O'Brien and her husband Nicholas, a retired Garda superintendent, who were converting the house into an arts centre. The redevelopment had been a troubled affair with tradesmen employed on the work leaving complaining of ghosts. One night, {{a friend of the}} O'Brien's, artist Tom McAssey, and two workmen were confronted by a spectral figure and a black <b>cat</b> <b>with</b> glowing red eyes. McAssey painted a portrait of the cat which hung in the house for several years after. Although locals were sceptical of the reports, further apparitions were reported, most notably of an Indian gentleman and of two nuns called Blessed Margaret and Holy Mary who had taken part in black masses on Mount Pelier Hill. There were also reports of ringing bells and poltergeist activity. In 1970 an RTÉ television crew recorded a documentary at the house. In the documentary a clairvoyant called Sheila St. Clair communicated with the spirits of the house through automatic writing. In 1971, a plumber working in the house discovered a grave with a skeleton of a small figure, most likely that of a child or, perhaps, the body of the dwarf alleged to have been sacrificed by the members of the Hell Fire Club. The house operated as a restaurant in the 1990s before closing in 2001; it is now a private residence.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to present the clinical, {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) and histological data from 27 <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> inflammatory disease of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). The cats were part of a study of 61 cats admitted to two university clinics over an eight-year period because of signs of CNS disease. The most frequent diseases were feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) (12 / 27) and suspected viral disease other than FIP (10 / 27). Typical CSF findings in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> FIP were a protein concentration of greater than 2 g/L (200 mg/dL) and a white cell count of over 100 cells/microL, which consisted predominantly of neutrophils. In contrast, the CSF of <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> suspected viral disease had a protein concentration of less than 1 g/L (100 mg/dL) and a total white cell count of less than 50 cells/microL. In general, <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> FIP or suspected viral disease were less than four years of age. Neurological signs were usually multifocal in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> FIP, but focal in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> suspected viral disease. The CSF findings were variable in five other inflammatory diseases represented. Two <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> protozoan infection had normal CSF total cell counts but abnormal differential counts.

40|$|Magnesium {{deficiency}} {{has been}} associated with the development of cardiovascular disease in several species. Cats may be predisposed to alterations in magnesium status because of recent changes in the composition of commercial feline diets. The purposes of this study were 1) to examine the dietary history of <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), 2) to study magnesium status of <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> HCM compared to normal cats, and 3) {{to determine the effects of}} magnesium supplementation in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> HCM. In part 1 of the study, diets of 65 <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> HCM were examined retrospectively. Forty of the 45 cats for which diets could be determined (89 %) ate a diet designed to be magnesium-restricted and/or to produce an acidic urine. In part 2 of the study, 10 <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> HCM were compared to 10 healthy control cats for serum creatinine and magnesium; urine creatinine and magnesium, urine specific gravity and pH, and fractional excretion of magnesium. Urine creatinine and specific gravity were higher in control cats than in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> HCM. No other differences were found between the 2 groups. In part 3, <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> HCM were supplemented with either 210 mg magnesium chloride (n = 15) or 210 mg lactose (n = 15) for 12 wk. No differences between the 2 groups were found for changes in either magnesium status or echocardiographic parameters. However, the 30 <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> HCM, as a group, did show significant improvements in measures of cardiac hypertrophy over the 12 -week period. This was likely the result of treatment with other medications, rather than the magnesium supplementation. The results of this study suggest that <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> HCM are likely to be fed magnesium-restricted diets, but that they do not appear to have altered magnesium status compared to healthy controls...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that microbes {{play an important role}} in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases in various animal species, but only limited data is available about the microbiome in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> GI disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the fecal microbiome in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> diarrhea. Fecal samples were obtained from healthy cats (n = 21) and <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> acute (n = 19) or chronic diarrhea (n = 29) and analyzed by sequencing of 16 S rRNA genes, and PICRUSt was used to predict the functional gene content of the microbiome. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) revealed significant differences in bacterial groups between healthy <b>cats</b> and <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> diarrhea. The order Burkholderiales, the families Enterobacteriaceae, and the genera Streptococcus and Collinsella were significantly increased in diarrheic cats. In contrast the order Campylobacterales, the family Bacteroidaceae, and the genera Megamonas, Helicobacter, and Roseburia were significantly increased in healthy cats. Phylum Bacteroidetes was significantly decreased in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> chronic diarrhea (> 21 days duration), while the class Erysipelotrichi and the genus Lactobacillus were significantly decreased in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> acute diarrhea. The observed changes in bacterial groups were accompanied by significant differences in functional gene contents: metabolism of fatty acids, biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids, metabolism of biotin, metabolism of tryptophan, and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, were all significantly (p< 0. 001) altered in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> diarrhea. In conclusion, significant differences in the fecal microbiomes between healthy <b>cats</b> and <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> diarrhea were identified. This dysbiosis was accompanied by changes in bacterial functional gene categories. Future studies are warranted to evaluate if these microbial changes correlate with changes in fecal concentrations of microbial metabolites in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> diarrhea for the identification of potential diagnostic or therapeutic targets.

40|$|Background: Responsiveness of β-cells to {{arginine}} persists {{the longest}} during diabetes progression, making the intravenous arginine stimulation test (IVAST) {{a useful tool}} to assess residual insulin and glucagon secretion. Hypothesis: Diabetic <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> and without remission will have different arginine-induced insulin or glucagon response. Animals: 17 <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> diabetes, 7 healthy cats. Methods: Response to IVAST was assessed by calculating insulin and glucagon area under the curve (AUC) and the AUC glucagon:insulin ratio. Diabetic <b>cats</b> were treated <b>with</b> insulin and followed for 18 weeks. Remission was defined as normoglycemia and disappearance of clinical signs of diabetes for ≥ 4 weeks. Results: 7 diabetic cats achieved remission. On admission, blood glucose concentration was significantly lower in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> remission (median, 389 mg/dL) than in those without remission (median, 506 mg/dL). After IVAST, diabetic <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> remission had higher AUC glucagon:insulin ratios (median, 61) than did cats without remission (median, 26); glucose, insulin, and glucagon AUCs were not different.

After recovering the necklace for a third time, Howard was approached by Richards {{in the middle of his}} fight against the Ringmaster and Richards revealed himself to be Talos the Untamed, who revealed that the necklace was part of a marginally powerful item known as the Abundant Glove. With help from Doctor Strange, Howard and Tara located the final piece of the Abundant Glove, but were unable to put it all together when Talos grabbed it, who proceeded to use it to wreak havoc on the city. Talos was confronted by numerous heroes while Howard and Tara took cover. He was able to point out that Tara, who revealed to possess shapeshifting powers similar to that of a Skrull, could help him defeat Talos. Tara used her powers to impersonate Skrull Emperor Kl'rt (Super-Skrull), distracting Talos long enough for Howard to snatch the Abundant Glove from his hand. Talos was later apprehended by the Fantastic Four and everything went back to normal. Afterwards, with the help of new arrival Gwenpool, Howard prevented Hydra from infecting the world with a deadly virus. He also has a crossover event with The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl. Howard the Duck was shown to be living in She-Hulk's apartment building when Patsy Walker moves out.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: We {{documented}} the uncoupling of {{sympathetic nervous system}} activity from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> feline interstitial cystitis (FIC). Altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity was recently suggested in some humans with interstitial cystitis (IC) but to our knowledge no information exists on adrenal gland size and histopathology in this disease. To investigate further adrenal function in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> FIC we determined cortisol responses to 125 g synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) as well as adrenal size and histology. Materials and Methods: ACTH stimulation studies were performed in 11 healthy <b>cats</b> and 20 <b>with</b> FIC. Adrenal glands obtained at autopsy in 8 healthy <b>cats</b> and 13 <b>with</b> FIC were weighed, measured and examined histologically. Results: <b>Cats</b> <b>with</b> FIC had significantly decreased responses to ACTH (2 -way repeated measures ANOVA p 0. 05). Mean weight SD (58 50 vs 241 60 mg) and volume (264 72 vs 410 115 mm 3) of adrenal glands were significantly smaller in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> FIC than in healthy cats (p 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|Mammary carcinomas and adenocarcinomas (MACs) are {{relatively}} common tumors in cats. The postexcisional survival period of affected cats is {{inversely proportional to}} tumor size, but the reported median survival periods for different tumor size categories is quite variable. This variability diminishes the prognostic value of reported data. In our study, <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> MACs greater than 3 cm in diameter had a 12 -month median survival period, whereas those with MACs less than 3 cm in diameter had a 21 -month survival period. Survival periods for <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> MACs smaller than 3 cm ranged from 3 to 54 months; therefore, tumor size alone is of limited prognostic value in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> MACs smaller than 3 cm in diameter. In <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> MACs larger than 3 cm in diameter, tumor size appears to have much higher prognostic relevance, because this study, as well as others, have indicated that <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> MACs greater than 3 cm in diameter have a poor prognosis, with median survival periods ranging from 4 to 12 months...|$|R
40|$|Background: Primary hyperaldosteronism (PHA) in cats is {{suggested}} by clinical signs and an elevated plasma aldosterone- to-renin ratio (ARR), but a test to confirm the diagnosis is lacking. Hypothesis: Fludrocortisone does not suppress urinary aldosterone excretion in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> PHA, but does so in <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> arterial hypertension because of other causes. Animals: Nineteen client-owned <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> arterial hypertension because of PHA (n = 9) or other causes (n = 10). Methods: Prospective clinical study. The urinary aldosterone-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) was determined in morning urine before, during, and after 4 days of oral fludrocortisone administration in a dose of 0. 05 mg/kg q 12 h. Arterial blood pressure and plasma potassium concentration were measured before and after fludrocortisone administration. Results: A basal UACR above 46. 5 9 10 9, the upper limit of the reference range, was found in 3 <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> PHA. All PHA cats had basal UACRs > 7. 5 9 10 9. In all non-PHA <b>cats</b> <b>with</b> a basal UACR > 7. 5 9 10 9, fludrocortisone administration induced > 50 % suppression. In contrast, fludrocortisone administration resulted i...|$|R
