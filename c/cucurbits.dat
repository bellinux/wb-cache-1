40|$|The {{effect of}} soil {{temperature}} on transpiration rates in cucumber, <b>cucurbit</b> and their grafted plants (grafted cucumber plant with a stock of <b>cucurbit</b> plant) was examined by heat balance {{analysis of the}} leaf in an on-line measurement. In cucumber plant, higher transpiration rates were found at soil temperatures of 15 to 30 ℃, and soil temperatures below 15 or above 30 ℃ resulted in a decrease in transpiration rate. In <b>cucurbit</b> plant, transpiration rates were higher at soil temperatures of 10 to 40 ℃ and decreased at other soil temperatures. Thus, the transpiration in <b>cucurbit</b> plant was kept higher even at lower and higher soil temperatures of 10 and 35 - 40 ℃ where the transpiration in cucumber plant decreased. This fact suggests that <b>cucurbit</b> plant is more active in water uptake into roots in wider region of soil temperature, as compared with cucumber plant. In the grafted plant, the pattern of transpiration rates responding to soil temperature {{was similar to that}} in <b>cucurbit</b> plant. From this pattern in the grafted plant, it could be conceivable that the activity of the <b>cucurbit</b> roots used as a stock is responsible for water process in the grafted cucumber plant in relation to the soil temperature...|$|R
40|$|Effect of sowing dates on the agronomic {{performance}} of the intercrops: Lagenaria siceraria (Molina) Standl. (Cucurbitaceae) and Manihot esculenta Crantz (Euphorbiaceae). Description of the subject. The intercropping system is a beneficial method, which is widely used in tropical areas for sustainable soil fertility management, and {{has been found to}} improve both the yields of traditional agriculture and the income of small producers. Objectives. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare and evaluate the effect of associated culture and pure culture of <b>cucurbit</b> Lagenaria siceraria creeping plant and the variety of cassava Manihot esculenta var. 'Bonoua Blanc' upright plant on the {{agronomic performance}} of each crop. Method. An experiment was established in randomized complete block design with three replicates per treatment. The treatments compared were firstly, associated crops M. esculenta var. 'Bonoua Blanc' / L. siceraria with <b>cucurbit</b> seedlings at 0 days (CAT 0), 15 days (CAT 15), 30 days (CAT 30) and 45 days (CAT 45) after cassava; secondly, pure cultures of <b>cucurbit</b> on the same dates as for associated crops (CPT 0, CPT 15, CPT 30 and CPT 45), and thirdly, a pure culture of cassava at 0 days (CP). Nine agronomic characteristics were analyzed in <b>cucurbit</b> and eight in cassava. Results. The agronomic parameters evaluated were the yield components of cassava, which varied with the increase in seedling time of <b>cucurbit.</b> However, the performance of <b>cucurbit</b> decreased with the increase in seedlings either in the associated crop or in pure culture. Performance also decreased sharply for the same sowing dates in pure culture. Despite high productivity when <b>cucurbit</b> was simultaneously planted with cassava, it remained low compared to the <b>cucurbit</b> pure crop. Conclusions. Intercropping of <b>cucurbit</b> L. siceraria and cassava M. esculenta was not found to be beneficial to the yield of the individual crops. However, the use of <b>cucurbit</b> as an intercropping cover crop helps to conserve soil moisture and to manage arable land and weeds for the benefit of cassava crops...|$|R

5|$|Cucurbita (Latin for gourd) is a genus of {{herbaceous}} vines in {{the gourd}} family, Cucurbitaceae, {{also known as}} <b>cucurbits,</b> native to the Andes and Mesoamerica. Five species are grown worldwide for their edible fruit, variously known as squash, pumpkin, or gourd depending on species, variety, and local parlance, and for their seeds. Other kinds of gourd, also called bottle-gourds, are native to Africa and belong to the genus Lagenaria, {{which is in the}} same family and subfamily as Cucurbita but in a different tribe. These other gourds are used as utensils or vessels, and their young fruits are eaten much like those of Cucurbita species.|$|E
5|$|They are {{responsible}} for pollination of approximately {{one third of the}} United States' crop species, including such species as almonds, peaches, apples, pears, cherries, raspberries, blackberries, cranberries, watermelons, cantaloupes, cucumbers, and strawberries. Many, but not all, of these plants can be (and often are) pollinated by other insects in the U.S., including other kinds of bees (e.g., squash bees on <b>cucurbits),</b> but typically not on a commercial scale. While some farmers of a few kinds of native crops do bring in honey bees to help pollinate, none specifically need them, and when honey bees are absent from a region, there is a presumption that native pollinators may reclaim the niche, typically being better adapted to serve those plants (assuming that the plants normally occur in that specific area).|$|E

50|$|Downy mildew {{refers to}} any of several types of oomycete {{microbes}} that are obligate parasites of plants. Downy mildews exclusively belong to Peronosporaceae. In commercial agriculture, they are a particular problem for growers of crucifers, grapes and vegetables that grow on vines. The prime example is Peronospora farinosa featured in NCBI-Taxonomy and HYP3. This pathogen does not produce survival structures in the northern states of the United States, and overwinters as live mildew colonies in Gulf Coast states. It progresses northward with <b>cucurbit</b> production each spring. Yield loss associated with downy mildew is most likely related to soft rots that occur after plant canopies collapse and sunburn occurs on fruit. <b>Cucurbit</b> downy mildew only affects leaves of <b>cucurbit</b> plants.|$|R

Salt cementation continued to be the main method of parting until the 16th century but in later Middle Ages processes using sulfur, antimony and mineral acids began to be used. There are archaeological finds at sites in London of distillation vessels for making acids in Britain from the 15th century which include fragments of ceramic <b>cucurbits</b> (vessels for heating reacting chemicals) which were used with alembics for distillation. By the 18th century cementation was rarely used and had been replaced by acid treatment. Into modern times the acid parting method continued to be used but other methods were discovered. In 1860's Australia the Miller process was developed, this removed silver by bubbling chlorine gas through the molten gold mixture.

The method is realized for garden strawberry and <b>cucurbit</b> pulp. The mass concentration of solid in the fractions of <b>cucurbit</b> pulp is defined and the specific weight of the fractions are defined. It is shown that the solid of the <b>cucurbit</b> pulp is uniformly allocated between the fractions and amounts 34 % for the dry juice, 31 % for the dry refuse, and 35 % for the natural water.

Severe yellowing symptoms on older leaves of melon and chlorotic spots on younger leaves of melon were observed in the plastic tunnels. The symptoms were widespread and included initial chlorotic lesions followed by yellowing of whole leaves and thickening of older leaves. RT-PCR analysis using total RNA extracted from diseased leaves did not show any synthesized products for four cucurbit-infecting viruses; Beet pseudo-yellows virus, Cucumber mosaic virus, <b>Cucurbit</b> yellows stunting disorder virus, and Melon necrotic spot virus. Virus identification using RT-PCR showed <b>Cucurbit</b> aphid-borne yellows Virus (CABYV) was largely distributed in melon, oriental melon and cucumber.
