25|$|Power {{capacitors}} can be {{used for}} a wide variety of applications, even where extremely non-sinusoidal voltages and pulsed currents are present. Both AC and DC capacitors are available. AC capacitors serve as damping or snubbing capacitors when connected in series with a resistor, and are also specified for the damping of undesirable voltage spikes caused by the so-called charge <b>carrier</b> <b>storage</b> effect during switching of power semiconductors. In addition, AC capacitors are used in low-detuned or close-tuned filter circuits for filtering or absorbing harmonics. As pulse discharge capacitors, they are useful in applications with reversing voltages, such as in magnetizing equipment.|$|E
25|$|Schottky diodes are {{constructed}} from a metal to semiconductor contact. They {{have a lower}} forward voltage drop than p–n junction diodes. Their forward voltage drop at forward currents of about 1mA is in the range 0.15V to 0.45V, which makes them useful in voltage clamping applications and prevention of transistor saturation. They {{can also be used}} as low loss rectifiers, although their reverse leakage current is in general higher than that of other diodes. Schottky diodes are majority carrier devices and so do not suffer from minority <b>carrier</b> <b>storage</b> problems that slow down many other diodes—so they have a faster reverse recovery than p–n junction diodes. They also tend to have much lower junction capacitance than p–n diodes, which provides for high switching speeds and their use in high-speed circuitry and RF devices such as switched-mode power supply, mixers, and detectors.|$|E
