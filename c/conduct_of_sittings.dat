40|$|Measuring {{sedentary}} behaviour {{and physical}} activity with wearable sensors provides detailed information on activity patterns and can serve health interventions. At the basis of activity analysis stands the ability to distinguish sedentary from active time. As {{there is no consensus}} regarding the optimal cut-point for classifying sedentary behaviour, we studied the consequences of using different cut-points for this type <b>of</b> analysis. We <b>conducted</b> a battery <b>of</b> <b>sitting</b> and walking activities with 14 office workers, wearing the Promove 3 D activity sensor to determine the optimal cut-point (in counts per minute (m·s− 2)) for classifying sedentary behaviour. Then, 27 office workers wore the sensor for five days. We evaluated the sensitivity of five sedentary pattern measures for various sedentary cut-points and found an optimal cut-point for sedentary behaviour of 1660 × 10 − 3 m·s− 2. Total sedentary time was not sensitive to cut-point changes within ± 10 % of this optimal cut-point; other sedentary pattern measures were not sensitive to changes within the ± 20 % interval. The results from studies analyzing sedentary patterns, using different cut-points, can be compared within these boundaries. Furthermore, commercial, hip-worn activity trackers can implement feedback and interventions on sedentary behaviour patterns, using these cut-points...|$|R

40|$|Background: Low {{back pain}} (LBP) {{is a major}} problem for office workers. Individuals {{adopting}} poor postures during prolonged sitting have a considerably increased risk of experiencing LBP. This study aimed to investigate seat pressure distribution characteristics, i. e., average pressure, peak pressure ratio, frequency of postural shift, and body perceived discomfort (BPD), during 1 hour <b>of</b> <b>sitting</b> among office workers with and without chronic LBP. Methods: Forty-six participants (chronic LBP= 23, control= 23) typed a standardized text passage at a computer work station for an hour. A seat pressure mat device was used to collect the seat pressure distribution data. Body discomfort was assessed using the Body Perceived Discomfort scale. Results: Office workers with chronic LBP sat significantly more asymmetrically than their healthy counterparts. During 1 -hour sitting, all workers appeared to assume slumped sitting postures after 20 minutes <b>of</b> <b>sitting.</b> Healthy workers had significantly more frequent postural shifts than chronic LBP workers during prolonged sitting. Conclusion: Different sitting characteristics between healthy and chronic LBP participants during 1 hour <b>of</b> <b>sitting</b> were found, including symmetry <b>of</b> <b>sitting</b> posture and frequency of postural shift. Further research should examine the roles <b>of</b> these <b>sitting</b> characteristics on the development of LBP...|$|R

40|$|High amounts <b>of</b> {{time spent}} <b>sitting</b> can {{increase}} cardiovascular disease risk and are deleteriously associated cardio-metabolic risk biomarkers. Though {{evidence suggests that}} accruing sitting time in prolonged periods may convey additional risk, verification using high-quality measures is needed. We examined this issue in adults from the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study, using accurate measures <b>of</b> <b>sitting</b> accumulation. In 2011 / 12, 739 adults aged 36 to 89 years (mean±SD 58 ± 10 years) wore activPAL 3 ™ monitors (which provide accurate objective measures of sitting); 678 provided ≥ 4 valid days of monitor data and complete cardio-metabolic biomarker and confounder data. Multivariable linear regression models examined associations <b>of</b> <b>sitting</b> time, sitting time accrued in ≥ 30 minute bouts (prolonged sitting time), and three measures <b>of</b> <b>sitting</b> accumulation patterns with cardio-metabolic risk markers: body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, blood pressure, high- and low- density lipoprotein (HDL and LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2 -hour post-load glucose (PLG). Interactions tests examined whether associations <b>of</b> <b>sitting</b> time with biomarkers varied by usual sitting bout duration. Adjusted for potential confounders, greater amounts <b>of</b> <b>sitting</b> time and prolonged sitting time were significantly (p< 0. 05) deleteriously associated with BMI, waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. Total sitting time was also significantly associated with higher PLG. Sitting accumulation patterns <b>of</b> frequently interrupted <b>sitting</b> (compared to patterns with relatively more prolonged sitting) were significantly beneficially associated with BMI, waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, PLG, and with FPG. Effect sizes were typically larger for accumulation patterns than for sitting time. Significant interactions (p< 0. 05) showed that associations <b>of</b> <b>sitting</b> time with HDL, triglycerides and PLG became more deleterious the longer at a time sitting was usually accumulated. Adding to previous evidence reliant on low-quality measures, our study showed that accumulating sitting in patterns where sitting was most frequently interrupted had significant beneficial associations with several cardio-metabolic biomarkers and that sitting for prolonged periods at a time may exacerbate some of the effects <b>of</b> <b>sitting</b> time. The findings support sedentary behavior guidelines that promote reducing and regularly interrupting sitting...|$|R

40|$|Background: Prolonged sitting {{leads to}} low back {{discomfort}} and lumbopelvic muscle fatigue. This {{study examined the}} characteristics of body perceived discomfort and trunk muscle fatigue during 1 hour <b>of</b> <b>sitting</b> in three postures in office workers. Methods: Thirty workers sat for 1 hour in one <b>of</b> three <b>sitting</b> postures (i. e., upright, slumped, and forward leaning postures). Body discomfort was assessed using the Body Perceived Discomfort scale {{at the beginning and}} after 1 hour <b>of</b> <b>sitting.</b> Electromyographic (EMG) signals were recorded from superficial lumbar multifidus, iliocostalis lumborum pars thoracis, internal oblique (IO) /transversus abdominis (TrA), and rectus abdominis muscles during 1 hour <b>of</b> <b>sitting.</b> The median frequency (MDF) of the EMG power spectrum was calculated. Results: Regardless <b>of</b> the <b>sitting</b> posture, the Body Perceived Discomfort scores in the neck, shoulder, upper back, low back, and buttock significantly increased after 1 hour <b>of</b> <b>sitting</b> compared with baseline values (t(9)  = − 11. 97 to − 2. 69, p <  0. 05). The MDF value of the EMG signal of rectus abdominis, iliocostalis lumborum pars thoracis, and multifidus muscles was unchanged over time in all three sitting postures. Only the right and left IO/TrA in the slumped sitting posture was significantly associated with decreased MDF over time (p =  0. 019 to 0. 041). Conclusion: Prolonged sitting led to increased body discomfort in the neck, shoulder, upper back, low back, and buttock. No sign of trunk muscle fatigue was detected over 1 hour <b>of</b> <b>sitting</b> in the upright and forward leaning postures. Prolonged slumped sitting may relate to IO/TrA muscle fatigue, which may compromise the stability of the spine, making it susceptible to injury...|$|R
