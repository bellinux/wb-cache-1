50|$|At {{this point}} in the {{learning}} cycle, if no classifiers made it into either M or C (as would be the case when the population starts off empty), the <b>covering</b> <b>mechanism</b> is applied (fifth step). Covering is a form of online smart population initialization. Covering randomly generates a rule that matches the current training instance (and in the case of supervised learning, that rule is also generated with the correct action. Assuming the training instance is (001001 ~ 0), covering might generate any of the following rules: (#0#0## ~ 0), (001001 ~ 0), (#010## ~ 0). Covering not only ensures that each learning cycle {{there is at least one}} correct, matching rule in C, but that any rule initialized into the population will match at least one training instance. This prevents LCS from exploring the search space of rules that do not match any training instances.|$|E
50|$|Rules can be {{represented}} {{in many different ways}} to handle different data types (e.g. binary, discrete-valued, ordinal, continuous-valued). Given binary data LCS traditionally applies a ternary rule representation (i.e. rules can include either a 0, 1, or '#' for each feature in the data). The 'don't care' symbol (i.e. '#') serves as a wild card within a rule's condition allowing rules, and the system as a whole to generalize relationships between features and the target endpoint to be predicted. Consider the following rule (#1###0 ~ 1) (i.e. condition ~ action). This rule can be interpreted as: IF the second feature = 1 AND the sixth feature = 0 THEN the class prediction = 1. We would say that the second and sixth features were specified in this rule, while the others were generalized. This rule, and the corresponding prediction are only applicable to an instance when the condition of the rule is satisfied by the instance. This is more commonly referred to as matching. In Michigan-style LCS, each rule has its own fitness, {{as well as a number}} of other rule-parameters associated with it that can describe the number of copies of that rule that exist (i.e. the numerosity), the age of the rule, its accuracy, or the accuracy of its reward predictions, and other descriptive or experiential statistics. A rule along with its parameters is often referred to as a classifier. In Michigan-style systems, classifiers are contained within a population P that has a user defined maximum number of classifiers. Unlike most stochastic search algorithms (e.g. evolutionary algorithms), LCS populations start out empty (i.e. there is no need to randomly initialize a rule population). Classifiers will instead be initially introduced to the population with a <b>covering</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|E

The Adapted Pittsburgh Classifier System is a learning classifier system that uses genetic algorithms to evolve its ruleset.

40|$|Algorithmic {{mechanism}} design {{deals with}} efficiently-computable algorithmic constructions {{in the presence}} of strategic players who hold the inputs to the problem and may misreport their input if doing so benefits them. Algorithmic mechanism design finds applications in a variety of internet settings such as resource allocation, facility location and e-commerce, such as sponsored search auctions. There is an extensive amount of work in algorithmic mechanism design on packing problems such as single-item auctions, multi-unit auctions and combinatorial auctions. But, surprisingly, covering problems, also called procurement auctions, have almost been completely unexplored, especially in the multidimensional setting. In this thesis, we systematically investigate multidimensional covering mechanism- design problems, wherein there are m items that need to be covered and n players who provide covering objects, with each player i having a private cost for the covering objects he provides. A feasible solution to the covering problem is a collection of covering objects (obtained from the various players) that together cover all items. Two widely considered objectives in mechanism design are: (i) cost-minimization (CM) which aims to minimize the total cost incurred by the players and the mechanism designer; and (ii) payment minimization (PayM), which aims to minimize the payment to players. <b>Covering</b> <b>mechanism</b> design problems turn out to behave quite differently from packing mechanism design problems. In particular, various techniques utilized successfully for packing problems do not perform well for <b>covering</b> <b>mechanism</b> design problems, and this necessitates new approaches and solution concepts. In this thesis we devise various techniques for handling <b>covering</b> <b>mechanism</b> design problems, which yield a variety of results for both the CM and PayM objectives. In our investigation of the CM objective, we focus on two representative covering problems: uncapacitated facility location (UFL) and vertex cover. For multi-dimensional UFL, we give a black-box method to transform any Lagrangian-multiplier-preserving ρ-approximation algorithm for UFL into a truthful-in-expectation, ρ-approximation mechanism. This yields the first result for multi-dimensional UFL, namely a truthful-in-expectation 2 -approximation mechanism. For multi-dimensional VCP (Multi-VCP), we develop a decomposition method that reduces the mechanism-design problem into the simpler task of constructing threshold mechanisms, which are a restricted class of truthful mechanisms, for simpler (in terms of graph structure or problem dimension) instances of Multi-VCP. By suitably designing the decomposition and the threshold mechanisms it uses as building blocks, we obtain truthful mechanisms with approximation ratios (n is the number of nodes) : (1) O(r 2 log n) for r-dimensional VCP; and (2) O(r log n) for r-dimensional VCP on any proper minor-closed family of graphs (which improves to O(log n) if no two neighbors of a node belong to the same player). These are the first truthful mechanisms for Multi-VCP with non-trivial approximation guarantees. For the PayM objective, we work in the oft-used Bayesian setting, where players’ types are drawn from an underlying distribution and may be correlated, and the goal is to minimize the expected total payment made by the mechanism. We consider the problem of designing incentive compatible, ex-post individually rational (IR) mechanisms for covering problems in the above model. The standard notion of incentive compatibility (IC) in such settings is Bayesian incentive compatibility (BIC), but this notion is over-reliant on having precise knowledge of the underlying distribution, which makes it a rather non- robust notion. We formulate a notion of IC that we call robust Bayesian IC (robust BIC) that is substantially more robust than BIC, and develop black-box reductions from robust BIC-mechanism design to algorithm design. This black-box reduction applies to single- dimensional settings even when we only have an LP-relative approximation algorithm for the algorithmic problem. We obtain near-optimal mechanisms for various covering settings including single- and multi-item procurement auctions, various single-dimensional covering problems, and multidimensional facility location problems. Finally, we study the notion of frugality, which considers the PayM objective but in a worst-case setting, where one does not have prior information about the players’ types. We show that some of our mechanisms developed for the CM objective are also good with respect to certain oft-used frugality benchmarks proposed in the literature. We also introduce an alternate benchmark for frugality, which more directly reflects the goal that the mechanism’s payment be close to the best possible payment, and obtain some preliminary results with respect to this benchmark...|$|E

The experimental area was conducted on clayey soil under no-tillage with a large quantity of sorghum residue.

We assessed the coverage permanence on soil index, vegetation mass on surface and inside the line. The treatment containing the row cleaner mechanism efficiently removed straw from the surface of sowing line as well as the return one acted on straw replacement. It was identified that use of the cutting disc at the front of seeder contributed to the increase of straw installation inside the line, three times more than in the row cleaner system when operating individually. <b>Covering</b> <b>mechanism</b> with row cleaners reduced straw inside the line and kept line covering similar to treatment of cutting disc operating alone...|$|E

Through the years, dryland farmers experience an increasingly erratic rainfall and frequent occurrence of droughts.

Rainfall insurance, a type of Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS), was introduced as a risk <b>covering</b> <b>mechanism</b> to extreme rainfall events and to reduce hassles in operationalization of other crop insurance schemes. This study documents rainfall insurance scheme and its operational modalities such as eligibility criteria, payment of premium, benefit structure and payouts, and technical hassles. It examined the hypothesis that low spread of rainfall insurance was linked with the situation where prospective buyers were unable to relate the product to their regular exposure. This study also underlines incongruity comparing the variation in longitudinal actual village data and reference weather data (mandal level 3) that were used to calculate strike, exit and payouts to the farmers across six villages of semi-arid tropics (SAT) region.

40|$|Cue: It?s widely {{acknowledged}} that HIV and AIDS pose an enormous threat to food production {{in many of}} Africa?s agriculture-dependent countries. For anyone to die from AIDS is a tragedy, but in Africa, {{many of those who}} are dying are the backbone of the farming labour force. How can those who are left behind, the very old, the very young, the widows and the orphans, manage to grow the crops they require for their own food and income needs? One answer, being promoted by the NGO Africare, is the use of labour saving technologies, that allow cultivation of sufficient areas of land with much less human labour than has been needed in the past. Africare has designed new implements, such as ploughs, planters and harvesters, which can be operated even by old people or fairly young children. Chris Kakunta recently visited a field day in his home country of Zambia, {{to find out more about}} the equipment Africare is promoting. He sent us this report. IN:		?I am here at the Africare ?? OUT:		??You are most welcome. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 58 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Chris Kakunta reporting from Magoye, Zambia, on new labour-saving equipment being promoted by the NGO Africare. Transcript Kakunta	I am here at the Africare stand, Magoye, Mazibuka, some 150 km south of Lusaka. Africare is one of the NGOs that has come to exhibit some of their equipment that they are promoting among small scale farmers at this year?s field day, particularly to small scale farmers who are vulnerable. And with me is Munachoongo Muleya, the field officer with the organisation. To start with Munachoongo, what are some of these equipment that you are trying to promote? Muleya	What we are doing actually, we are looking at two main areas. We are looking at conservation tillage and crop processing. So what we have here are conservation tillage implements and we have post-harvest machinery. Kakunta	How can the farmers benefit from this equipment that you are promoting? Muleya	You know these days, Chris, we are talking of HIV and AIDS, and actually we are talking of farmers who have lost their animals due to Corridor [disease]. And what you can see here, we have the rippers, we have the groundnut lifter, we have the cultivators, we have the weed-sweep. These implements that you see can be used by a farmer who has maybe two oxen. That farmer can use and actually rip the field as much as he wants. Kakunta	Let?s take for instance the ripper, this one, which is looking like a small plough really. Muleya	Actually this ripper that we are seeing here, it?s a ripper that can be used by any farmer, and what we have done it we have just designed this attachment and then you put it onto the usual beam. You know these beams at our farms, the plough beams that we have, you know the farmers have this tendency of saying, ?No, they have brought up this new technology but it is very expensive. ? Everything now we are making, it has to be fitted on the old beam, the old plough beam that we have on our farm. So you just have to attach the ripper to the beam which we have; then you use it to make your own furrows at the farm. Kakunta	When you came up with all this equipment, what was in your mind? Muleya	You know if you go to the villages now, Chris, you only find the old and the young. And actually in the villages there, the people who do most of the work are the women. Now we are saying, since we have the old men there at the farms, we have the old men in the village, if we bring these implements, and you can see on that poster Chris, that?s a poster for a maize sheller, and that?s a poster for a ripper, you know these men they get interested. The next thing you can see there is the ripper planter. Instead of the women following the animals everyday, the man will just put on the ripper planter, put the seed, he will make the furrow, he will plant, and the same ripper planter you are seeing has a <b>covering</b> <b>mechanism.</b> You rip, then it plants behind, and it covers. Then it does three jobs at once. So it will be easier for the old men in the village there to do the work alone. Kakunta	How are the vulnerable, the women and children, the widows and orphans, how are they able to access some of this equipment. Do you have a mechanism in place? Muleya	We don?t give direct loans, but we work with lending institutions like micro-bankers trust, and women finance co-operatives. These people, when we go into the villages, we go with them, and the farmers are able to access money from these lending institutions and are able to buy our machines. I can give you an example; that group that you can see there is Manyama farmers group. They were able to access that peanut butter machine and now here in Magoye, these women are making peanut butter. That means the family and themselves, even their husbands - you can see that husband there is getting interested, because there is money coming out. And that peanut butter, actually, when you talk of HIV and AIDS, they can use it for the porridge, for the children. They can put it in relish. And you know it makes life easier. Kakunta	What about the health concerns. How are you addressing them? Muleya	Actually Chris, on health, it?s not direct, that we go to those people who are directly affected by HIV/AIDS. We are targeting those people who are there in the villages, who have remained. We are talking of the old and the young. You know, the old ladies who are looking after the orphans and those orphans who have been left; we don?t want these people to make excuses, that?s why we have made sure that we have these implements which are labour saving, which can be used by the old women - the ripper can be used by an old man, even a young boy. The ripper will just go, within two hours it will be a hectare. And that woman, what she needs is just to go and put in the seed when the rains come. That means that woman will be able to harvest; she won?t even make an excuse that she had nothing to use, and that?s why she is going hungry now. These farmers have to change with time, because everything is changing. Even the rains are changing. Then why don?t you change the implements that you are using as a farmer? Kakunta	I would like to thank you so much. Muleya	You are most welcome. End of track. Munachoongo Mulaya, a field officer with the NGO Africare explains how labour-saving farm equipment can be a major advantage for communities who have lost much of their manpower to diseases such as HIV/AID...|$|E

Although conventional insurance <b>mechanisms</b> <b>covering</b> individual losses are not cost effective in low income extensive grazing pastoral communities, index insurance for livestock offers a promising alternative. This paper identifies regions most suitable for an index-based livestock insurance product: areas predicted to have high covariaterisk from drought, high potential demand for a livestock insurance product, and supporting market infrastructure for an insurance product. Our findings support current efforts to implement index insurance in Kenya and Ethiopia, and reveal additional areas for geographic expansion in western and southern Africa.

40|$|This essay {{considers}} {{the work of}} artists, designers, and activists who, since the 1990 s, have worked with body <b>covering</b> as survival <b>mechanism</b> and social tool. Individually or within collectives, they call their work art, design, or activism; or all three. The result is a "body of records " of technological, biological, and per-formable wearables that have not received the atten-tion they deserve, either as art or design, or as vehi-cles for ideas about threats to species survival and collective experience. For example, we can consider wearable artworks {{in the form of}} survival attire embedded in localized per-formative events concerned with social connection under adverse circumstances. Lucy Orta is prominent among such practitioners, who formulate clothing the body as critical, social, and ethical practice within an ambient "culture of fear. "...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{a digital}} library system, {{documents}} {{are available in}} digital form and therefore are more easily copied and their copyrights are more easily violated. This {{is a very serious}} problem, as it discourages owners of valuable information from sharing it with authorized users. There are two main philosophies for addressing this problem: prevention and detection. The former actually makes unauthorized use of documents difficult or impossible while the latter makes it easier to discover such activity. In this paper we propose a system for registering documents and then detecting copies, either complete copies or partial copies. We describe algorithms for such detection, and metrics required for evaluating detection <b>mechanisms</b> (<b>covering</b> accuracy, efficiency, and security). We also describe a working prototype, called COPS, describe implementation issues, and present experimental results that suggest the proper settings for copy detection parameters...|$|R
40|$|Relationships among {{different}} modeling perspectives have been systematically investigated focusing either on given notations (e. g. UML) or on domain reference models (e. g. ARIS/SAP). In contrast, many successful informal methods for business analysis and requirements engineering (e. g. JAD) emphasize team negotiation, goal orientation and flexibility of modeling notations. This paper addresses the question how much formal and computerized support {{can be provided}} in such settings without destroying their creative tenor. Our solution {{is based on a}} novel modeling language design, M-Telos, that integrates the adaptability and analysis advantages of the logic-based meta modeling language Telos with a module concept <b>covering</b> the structuring <b>mechanisms</b> of scalable software architectures. It comprises four components: (1) A modular conceptual modeling formalism organizes individual perspectives and their interrelationships. (2) Perspective schemata are linked to a conceptual meta meta [...] ...|$|R
