E-DRM, now more commonly referenced as IRM (Information Rights Management), is generally intended to prevent the unauthorized use (such as industrial or corporate espionage or inadvertent release) of proprietary documents. IRM typically integrates with content management system software but corporations such as Samsung Electronics also develop their own custom DRM systems.|$|E

25|$|As Attorney General, Spitzer {{stepped up}} {{the profile of}} the office. Traditionally, state {{attorneys}} general have pursued consumer rights cases, concentrating on local fraud while deferring national issues to the federal government. Breaking with this traditional deference, Spitzer took up civil actions and criminal prosecutions relating to corporate white-collar crime, securities fraud, Internet fraud, and environmental protection. The New York Attorney General's office has Wall Street (and thus many leading corporate and financial institutions) within its jurisdiction. Also, the New York Attorney General wields greater than usual powers of investigation and prosecution of corporations under New York State's General Business Law. In particular, under the Martin Act of 1921, the New York Attorney General has the power to subpoena witnesses and company documents pertaining to investigations of fraud or illegal activity by a corporation. Spitzer used this statute to allow his office to prosecute cases which have been described as within federal jurisdiction. Spitzer used this authority in his civil actions against corporations and criminal prosecutions against their officers. It proved useful in the wake of several U.S. corporate scandals that began with the collapse of Enron in 2001. Several of these corporations, as well as the brokerage houses that sold their stock, were accused of having inflated stock values by unethical means throughout the 1990s. When inquiries into these allegations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Congress failed, Spitzer's office used its subpoena power to obtain <b>corporate</b> <b>documents,</b> building cases against the firms both in courtrooms and in public opinion.|$|E

40|$|A {{three year}} Esprit project - ProCure - is {{ultimately}} aiming {{to take a}} significant but achievable step forward {{in the application of}} available information and communication technology (ICT) to the large scale engineering (LSE) construction industry. The ProCure consortium consists of five industrial partners supported by four associated research and expert partners. The project combines leading expertise from three member states to support ICT deployment by three industrial collaborative groups, i. e. UK, Germany and Finland. The basis of the project is in the partners' belief that sufficient ICT is now available to achieve deployment, with care, in real projects, with an acceptable risk of failure. This paper presents work undertaken within the project to investigate the various metadata standards that exist in order to define a minimum metadata set based on these standards for the implementation of two demonstrators for XML based automated document exchange between a simulation of a <b>corporate</b> <b>document</b> management system and a simulation of a collaborative construction project Web site...|$|R
40|$|Information Retrieval (IR) is the {{discipline}} {{that deals with}} retrieval of unstructured data, especially textual documents, {{in response to a}} query or topic statement, which may itself be unstructured, e. g., a sentence or even another document, or which may be structured, e. g., a boolean expression. The need for effective methods of automated IR has grown in importance because of the tremendous explosion in the amount of unstructured data, both internal, <b>corporate</b> <b>document</b> collections, and the immense and growing number of document sources on the Internet. This report is a tutorial and survey {{of the state of the}} art, both research and commercial, in this dynamic field.

40|$|Business and {{engineering}} knowledge in AEC/FM is captured mainly implicitly in project and <b>corporate</b> <b>document</b> repositories. Even {{with the increasing}} integration of model-based systems with project information spaces, {{a large percentage of}} the information exchange will further on rely on isolated and rather poorly structured text documents. In this paper we propose an approach enabling the use of product model data as a primary source of engineering knowledge to support information externalisation from relevant construction documents, to provide for domain-specific information retrieval, and to help in re-organising and re-contextualising documents in accordance to the user’s discipline-specific tasks and information needs. Suggested is a retrieval and mining framework combining methods for analysing text documents, filtering product models and reasoning on Bayesian networks to explicitly represent the content of text repositories in personalisable semantic content networks. We describe the proposed basic network that can be realised on short-term using minimal product model information as well as various extensions towards a full-fledged added value integration of document-based and model-based information...|$|R
