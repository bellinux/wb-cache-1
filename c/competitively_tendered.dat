40|$|AbstractIn 1993 {{the first}} of a series of {{cathodic}} protection (CP) systems were installed on the approach viaducts of a major UK bridge structure. Over subsequent years the structure had additional phases of repairs and CP installations. Due to the requirement to <b>competitively</b> <b>tender</b> each phase, a range of CP systems were installed between 1993 and 2013. The final phase was to replace the various power, control and monitoring systems that had been installed with a smaller number of more up to date units. As part of this process the historic operating performance of each system was employed to optimize the number and size of zones and the number of monitoring probes. In addition, a number of systems were installed but not energized until the final phase had been completed.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{successive}} governments, through the responsible department, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), have implemented programmes that involve private and third sector organisations <b>competitively</b> <b>tendering</b> to deliver programmes targeted at working age people including disabled people. Typically, however, these initiatives have only relatively small impacts on employment. This {{is not to}} deny that employment programmes have successfully placed some disabled people in employment rather to argue that the people most in need of support are the least served by these programmes. This occurs because the contracts have an incentive structure that rewards contractors for working with, and placing in employment, participants who are more job ready. Providers are then more likely to meet performance targets, and importantly for their finances, generate revenue income. Two examples of these programmes – the New Deal for Disabled People (NDDP) and Pathways to Work (Pathways) – are presented in this chapter to illustrate the argument that the marketisation of such provision can disadvantage many disabled people in the labour market...|$|R

This was to derive a decision-making process for its overseas representatives which would help on-the-spot decisions to comply with corporate policies whilst a bid is being presented to the client by the due date. The firm is divisionalised and operates in overseas territories as one single division using sub-contractors, or with co-operating divisions, or at group level. As the tendering personnel are one of the firm's scarce resources and also a most valuable resource, it is clear that they should be 'used' to the best advantage.

40|$|A {{dissertation}} thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of the degree Doctor of Engineering (EngD), at Loughborough UniversityAs <b>competitively</b> <b>tendering</b> for work is becoming increasingly difficult, and with profit margins reducing, UK construction companies are looking to differentiate their offering to clients. Safely delivering on time, within budget and to the required quality standard {{is no longer a}} differentiator in a market where clients are demanding increased value, building information modelling and life cycle provision. Construction companies are therefore looking to extend their activities into business consulting, financing and operational services, which will provide new sources of revenue in addition to their core production activities. This holistic service should provide solutions that meet their client s business needs, not just their building needs, ultimately resulting in long-standing relationships that over time yield a more predictable, long-term return. Over half of the top 20 UK construction companies, by turnover, have stated their intent to provide solutions to their clients - the case study organisation in which this research has been carried out is one of those companies. Part of a group of companies, the case study company, Shepherd Construction Ltd (SCL), has a vision to deliver integrated solutions to their clients, with the ultimate aim being that companies across the group can pool their expertise and deliver a service offering unique to the industry. Existing literature states the characteristics that integrated solutions providers need to possess, and proposes models for how an organisation needs to structure itself to deliver a service. However, the applicability of these models to SCL was unknown, and along with current literature on how to enact the transition pathway being vague, highlighted an area for investigation. Since the aim of integrated solutions provision is the delivery of a service to the client that adds value, it was proposed that lean thinking could provide a means of enacting the P-S transition: the starting point for lean thinking is value (Womack & Jones, 2003). Lean thinking principles (Womack & Jones, 2003) state that value needs to flow through the value stream the series of actions that transform inputs into the completed output raising the further proposition that flow is required through the stages of the integrated solutions lifecycle (the value stream) in order to successfully deliver all aspects of the client s value proposition, i. e. the desired solution. As a long established main-contractor, or product provider, SCL s challenge to transition from products-to-services was set against a backdrop of inconsistent performance and loss of continuity of service at crucial pinch-points in the delivery process. The action research carried out therefore sought to understand these problems and develop practices based on lean thinking that could be implemented in the company to enable consistent delivery of integrated solutions, i. e. enable the products-to-service transition, and in doing so provide the basis for the wider group vision. An abductive approach was taken to the research strategy; the experiences of the participants involved in the changes prompted by the action research process were used to inform the development of new theories and practices, and evaluate them once implemented. The methods used for collecting data and accounting for the experiences of people in the company included observation, both participant and non-participant, semi-structured interviews and analysis of company records. The research findings show that lean thinking has a role to play in enabling an organisation to transition from the provision of products to services. Standard processes and tools, based on lean thinking and developed through the action research framework, are shown to be the basis for consistent and repeatable performance within the phases of the integrated solutions lifecycle. Flow of information through and between phases of the lifecycle is then shown to be essential to ensuring the client s value proposition is realised and information is not lost during the transitions between lifecycle phases. The operational framework for service delivery, one of the practices developed, itself a form of standardised work, draws on lean thinking to provide a structured, yet flexible, means of developing a plan for service delivery that is focused on the client and ensuring the client s definition of value flows through the integrated solutions value stream and is therefore continually understood, and ultimately delivered, by the whole team as the project progresses. The practices developed through the research the standard company management system, operational framework for service delivery, service delivery plan and maturity assessment are shown to have improved consistency and company performance, and to have contributed to improved customer satisfaction (the ultimate aim of delivering a service) such that the company is starting to be perceived in the marketplace as an integrated solutions provider. This research also contributes to existing theory by evidencing that the transition pathway from products-to-services isn t as smooth as current literature portrays. In trying to implement current models in a construction setting, the products-to-service transition has been problematised and deficiencies in existing characteristics and models identified. Along with showing that lean thinking provides a theoretical framework for enacting the products-to-service transition, the hybrid model of the integrated solutions lifecycle developed, along with the maturity assessment, provide new theoretical insights, such as the need for feedback loops between all phases of the lifecycle...|$|R
40|$|Background By 2010 English health {{policy-makers}} {{had concluded}} that the main NHS commissioners [primary care trusts (PCTs) ] did not sufficiently control provider costs and performance. After the 2010 general election, they decided to replace PCTs with general practitioner (GP) -controlled Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). Health-care commissioners have six main media of power for exercising control over providers, {{which can be used}} in different combinations (‘modes of commissioning’). Objectives To: elicit the programme theory of NHS commissioning policy and empirically test its assumptions; explain what shaped NHS commissioning structures; examine how far current commissioning practice allowed commissioners to exercise governance over providers; examine how commissioning practices differ in different types of commissioning organisation and for specific care groups; and explain what factors influenced commissioning practice and the relationships between commissioners and providers. Design Mixed-methods realistic evaluation, comprising: Leximancer and cognitive frame analyses of policy statements to elicit the programme theory of NHS commissioning policy; exploratory cross-sectional analysis of publicly available managerial data about PCTs; systematic comparison of case studies of commissioning in four English sites – including commissioning for older people at risk of unplanned hospital admission; mental health; public health; and planned orthopaedic surgery – and of English NHS commissioning practice with that of a German sick-fund and an Italian region (Lombardy); action learning sets, to validate the findings and draw out practical implications; and two framework analyses synthesising the findings and testing the programme theory empirically. Results In the four English case study sites, CCGs were formed by recycling former commissioning structures, relying on and maintaining the existing GP commissioning leaderships. The stability of distributed commissioning depended on the convergence of commissioners’ interests. Joint NHS and local government commissioning was more co-ordinated at strategic than operational level. NHS providers’ responsiveness to commissioners reflected how far their interests converged, but also providers’ own internal ability to implement agreements. Commissioning for mental health services and to prevent recurrent unplanned hospital readmissions relied more on local ‘micro-commissioning’ (collaborative care pathway design) than on competition. Service commissioning was irrelevant to intersectoral health promotion, but not clinical prevention work. On balance, the possibility of competition did not affect service outcomes in the ways that English NHS commissioning policies assumed. ‘Commodified’ planned orthopaedic surgery most lent itself to provider competition. In all three countries, tariff payments increased provider activity and commissioners’ costs. To contain costs, commissioners bundled tariff payments into blocks, agreed prospective case loads with providers and paid below-tariff rates for additional cases. Managerial performance, negotiated order and discursive control were the predominant media of power used by English, German and Italian commissioners. Conclusions Commissioning practice worked in certain respects differently from what NHS commissioning policy assumed. It was often laborious and uncertain. In the four English case study sites financial and ‘real-side’ contract negotiations were partly decoupled, clinician involvement being least on the financial side. Tariff systems weakened commissioners’ capacity to choose providers and control costs. Commissioners adapted the systems to solve this problem. Our findings suggest a need for further research into whether or not differently owned providers (corporate, third sector, public, professional partnership, etc.) respond differently to health-care commissioners and, if so, what specific implications for commissioning practice follow. They also suggest that further work is needed to assess how commissioning practices impact on health system integration when care pathways have to be constructed across multiple providers that must <b>tender</b> <b>competitively</b> for work, perhaps against each other.

The main driver for the monitoring programme is the 1985 Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer. The Convention obliges parties (including the UK) to undertake inter alia monitoring, data dissemination and information exchange activities. The current monitoring programme comprises: • measurements of column ozone at two sites in the UK (Lerwick and Reading) • spectrally-resolved UV measurements at one site (Reading) The ozone element of the monitoring programme was reviewed in 2002. Defra has commissioned this review of the programme {{to ensure that it}} continues to meet current and future policy and scientific requirements as well as international obligations. The Review The review was structured in terms of 7 questions, which addressed a range of strategic, technical and organisational aspects of the monitoring programme. 1. How does the monitoring programme help to meet the UK obligations under the Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer? 2. Are the data currently collected in the monitoring programme fit for purpose? If not, what measures could be employed to make the data fit for purpose? Are there any activities in the current monitoring programme which are no longer needed? 3. Are the current measurement techniques viable into the future (over a 5 - 20 year timescale), and what other techniques/instruments are available? 4. Are current methodologies for disseminating information sufficient? If other techniques/instruments are preferable, how (or indeed could) they be introduced whilst maintaining the continuity of the results? 5. Is the current monitoring programme cost effective? 6.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess {{differences}} in the levels of cost efficiency of bus lines operated under <b>competitively</b> <b>tendered</b> contracts and performance-based negotiated contracts. Following the revision of the Swiss railways act in 1996, regional public authorities were given the choice between two different contractual regimes to procure public passenger transport services. We directly compare the impact of competitive tendering and performance-based negotiation by applying a stochastic frontier analysis to the complete dataset of bus lines (n= 630) operated by the main Swiss company (Swiss Post) at the same time (in 2009) throughout the country. The overall results show that the differences in the levels of cost efficiency between the two contractual regimes are not significant. Our findings are in line with recent evidence of cost convergence between competitive tendering and performance-based negotiation, and suggest that the practice of using both contractual regimes is challenging for the operators in terms of competitive pressure. The threat of competitive tendering may have a disciplining effect on negotiation since it prevents bus companies from bargaining inadequate rents and inducing asymmetric information advantages...|$|E
40|$|Workshop AIn 1994 the Government of South Australia {{initiated}} {{a process to}} contract out scheduled bus services in metropolitan Adelaide. The services, which currently involve use of about 760 buses that carry 47 million passengers per year in a service area of 880 square kilometres, had been operated by a Government organisation. Services were contracted out primarily on an areas basis, with ten area and four route contracts. By 1996 two contracts had been awarded to a private operator and three to the Government operator following two rounds of competitive tendering. Remaining services were provided by the Government operator through negotiated contracts. A review of the bus contracting system was undertaken in 1998, and features of the system modified, including {{a reduction in the}} number of contracts to six area and one route contract. All seven contracts were subsequently <b>competitively</b> <b>tendered</b> and won by private operators: the new contracts commenced in April 2000. The refinements to the Adelaide M odel secured greater interest from industry and keener pricing, which resulted in substantial cost savings. In developing the revised model, particular attention was paid to supplier market considerations. This included the division of responsibilities for service planning between the tendering authority and operators, and incentive structures to align operator objectives with Government goals in relation to service level, service quality and patronage. A number of other aspects of the former model were also revised. The paper also summarises the impacts of the overall competitive tendering process on costs, services and patronage. It draws out lessons learned that may be applicable to other authorities contemplating competitive tendering of public transport services...|$|E
40|$|In all {{the debates}} about {{copyright}} and intellectual property in recent years, {{the battle lines}} {{have tended to be}} drawn between librarians and publishers. This neglected what in some ways is the most important player of all, the employer. There seems little doubt that the university owns the copyright in articles, and universities are beginning seriously to turn their attention to this. Whether the article is in printed and/or electronic form probably makes no difference in law to ownership, but custom and practice are important here. A study has just been completed by the Centre for Educational Systems at Strathclyde University {{at the request of the}} Funding Councils to review current practice and benchmark the present position against future action. Higher education has turned itself into big business and as a result is beginning to contemplate more fully how to manage its assets. The total turnover in the sector now exceeds £ 10 billion pounds per annum. An 'average' university will have a turnover in the region of £ 120 - 150 million, less than half of which comes directly from the state.

40|$|Solving Australia’s {{long-term}} unemployment {{problem will}} take more than just another quick fix, writes John Quiggin EVERY year, it seems, we read of another restructuring of the Jobs Network, the <b>competitively</b> <b>tendered</b> replacement for the Commonwealth Employment Service that began operation in May 1998. The first round of reforms, announced in 1998 and 1999, was presented as resolving ‘teething difficulties’. In 2000 and 2001, ‘phantom jobs’ scandal, when employment agencies were found to be placing their clients in short-term jobs with associated labour hire-firms and pocketing a success fee that exceeded the wages paid to the clients. Now the government has been forced to guarantee payments to the agencies, regardless of whether targets are met. This completely undermines the payment-by-results logic used to justify contracting out. None of this would matter if the system actually placed unemployed workers in long-term sustainable jobs. When the unemployment rate fell to 6 per cent in mid- 2000, two years after the launch of the scheme, there were loud claims that the Network was working. Three years later, despite macroeconomic performance widely acclaimed as miraculous, the unemployment rate remains stuck at 6. 2 per cent. In the eight years since Labor’s 1995 budget cut the Working Nation program of employment assistance, the unemployment rate has fallen by only 2 percentage points, despite nearly continuous expansion in output. The contrast between growing GDP and static unemployment rates suggests the Jobs Network is not doing its job. Even the government’s own reports, such as that issued by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations in September, now admit that the Jobs Network has been almost totally ineffective in assisting the long-term unemployed. The only defence offered is that, based on several statistical measures, the previous government’s programs were equally ineffective and cost more to run. In the short term, the existence of a large pool of unemployed workers has some benefits. The unemployed keep other workers on their toes, a concept enshrined in the idea of a non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment. But, as the past 25 years has shown, the reserve army of the unemployed suffers from high wastage rates, as long-term unemployed workers withdraw from the labour force and the total supply of labour declines. Until now, the adverse effects of this decline have been masked by the bulge in labour supply arising from the baby boom. But with the first baby boomers now approaching their 60 s, the costs of past policies will soon become clear. The Business Council of Australia is finally waking up to this fact and is urging its members to change negative attitudes towards older workers. But much more extensive changes are needed. Almost every aspect of Australian labour market policy seems calculated to destroy human capital rather than build it. Damage is being done {{at both ends of the}} age range and, for that matter, in the middle as well. Since the Kemp-Vanstone cuts of 1996, the number of Australian students commencing higher education has been virtually static, and the quality of the education they receive has declined. School completion rates are only just recovering from the damage done by Kennett and Keating earlier in the 1990 s. The steady growth in average education levels needed to keep pace with the rest of the world is simply not taking place. Employers have sought, and gained, the flexibility to dismiss full-time ‘permanent’ employees and replace them with casuals or contractors who are employed on an ‘at will’ basis. This inevitably exposes many more people to the risk of becoming unemployed. And, with few new full-time jobs, the proportion of unemployed who become long-term unemployed is inevitably high. Without a serious commitment to active labour market policies, the natural outcome of long-term unemployment is withdrawal from the labour force. Rather than make a serious effort to reduce long-term unemployment, we have the cheap populism of ‘work for the dole’ and the ideological cost-cutting of the Jobs Network. A 6 per cent unemployment rate and declining full-time employment rates are pretty miserable outcomes for a country that has experienced both favourable demographics and one of the longest sustained economic expansions in its history. Things will be far worse when demography turns against us and when our macro-economic luck runs out, as it inevitably will.
