40|$|International audienceSnO 2 is Pd doped {{by using}} two {{different}} methods. In the first method, SnO 2 and PdCl 2 powders are simply mixed in a mixer, then cold pressed and sintered at high temperature. In the second one, a fixation method is used: a PdCl 42 − complex is chemically {{fixed on the}} surface of the SnO 2 powder, the fixed species subsequently being reduced to metallic Pd; powder is then cold pressed and sintered at 650 °C. Pd dispersion is lower in the case of the mixing method, but electrical properties are about the same for the two kinds of sensors realized by Coreci Company. On the one hand, CH 4 and aliphatic hydrocarbons are selectively detected at high temperature (400 - 450 °C). On the other hand, CO detection is possible at low temperature (50 °C, for example). Nevertheless, response time is long and can be improved by two different working modes: continuous pulsed temperature plus <b>cleaning</b> <b>pulse,</b> or isothermal measurement plus <b>cleaning</b> <b>pulse.</b> By doing this, the CO sensitivity is greatly increased, and the humidity variations are easy to compensate. However, the use of a carbon-based filter is necessary in order to avoid the presence of NOx which is a great interferent. These two kinds of sensors call be used either as a domestic alarm in order to control CH 4 or CO leaks, or as a control sensor in order to monitor car pollution...|$|E
40|$|This {{manuscript}} covers an on site industrial {{case study}} focused on the dry filtration of particulate matter (PM) from the waste stream of fertilizer production. In the industrial plant producing fertilizers, {{it was necessary to}} exchange the old wet scrubber with new cleaning equipment for PM disposal. A filter unit with bag filters and pulse-jet cleaning was chosen as the new waste-free technology. Unfortunately, one step in the production involves granulation with steam and water, therefore the waste gas stream was quite humid. Filter bags captured 10 g and 40 g of H 2 O/kg of dry gas for GR-SA and NPK fertilizers respectively. Due to dry filtration feasibility concerns, a long term pilot unit test was conducted. The impact of operating conditions, especially the inlet stream temperature and humidity was evaluated. A inlet temperature 100 °C for GR-SA and 110 °C for NPK fertilizers was necessary to prevent clogging of the filter bags. We found that different <b>cleaning</b> <b>pulses</b> periods and pulse pressures have a minimum impact on the filter pressure difference (ΔP). Based on the results of the pilot test, recommendations for usable technological conditions were given, in order to avoid problematic deposits on filter material associated with increased ΔP.

40|$|The {{cleaning}} of silicon surfaces from submicron dust particles {{has been studied}} {{by means of the}} “Steam Laser Cleaning ” (SLC) process and compared to “Dry Laser Cleaning ” (DLC) which is used nowadays in many applications. For SLC a thin liquid layer (e. g. a water-alcohol mixture) is condensed onto the substrate, and is subsequently evaporated by irradiating the surface with a short laser pulse. The DLC process, on the other hand, only relies on the laser pulse, without application of a vapor jet. We have systematically investigated the efficiency of these two processes for the removal of well-characterized polymer, silica and alumina particles of various sizes down to 60 nm in diameter, and have also studied the influence of light wavelength and laser pulse duration for nanosecond and picosecond pulses. The results demonstrate that for the gentle {{cleaning of}} silicon wafers SLC is a very efficient method and is superior to DLC.

The high mass transport rates of electroactive species to the microdisc from the solution phase results in a shift of the dissolved oxygen reduction wave to more negative potentials so that it does not interfere with the main methanol oxidation peak at sufficiently positive potentials (+ 0. 5 - + 0. 7 V vs. Ag/AgCl).

40|$|This thesis aims {{to improve}} the {{understanding}} of the factors that determine the performance of baghouses used for milk powder collection. The research focuses specifically on the similarities and differences between milk powder collection and other common baghouse applications. The thesis also aims to demonstrate the value of recent developments in computational fluid dynamics in developing predictive models of baghouse performance. It is hoped that the findings of the thesis may find application in the New Zealand dairy industry, where such baghouses are commonly used to collect milk powder after spray drying. The effect of operating temperature and humidity on the performance of baghouses was investigated by examining both the forward filtration process and pulse cleaning process. Forward filtration was examined in a series of bench scale experiments, then scaled up to the pilot scale to confirm the findings. The effect of humidity on the pulsing performance was then investigated at the pilot scale. The importance of pulse system design was investigated at the pilot scale in a separate set of experiments. Pulse nozzle position, pulse pressure, and pulse duration were varied and the effect on the baghouse pressure differentials was measured. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) filter model designed for membrane filtration was adapted with some success to simulate a milk powder baghouse. The model was successful in predicting the length of the low pressure zone {{at the top of the}} bag, and the general trends in overpressure associated with changes to the pulse system geometry. The model was not successful in predicting the acceleration of the filter bag during the pulse. The model was used to simulate both forward filtration and pulsing, to extend the results of the experimental investigation. The effects of changes in the pulse nozzle height, pulse nozzle diameter, and pulse pressure were simulated, as well as the effect of gravitational settling during forward filtration, to extend the results of the previous experiments. There is a clear opportunity remaining for further work to extend the basic model developed here and to adapt the model to simulate large industrial baghouses. Experiments on the bench scale and pilot scale indicated that increased cohesive forces between particles improve the performance of milk powder baghouses by lowering the resistance of the filter cake during forward filtration and aiding cake removal during pulse cleaning. Under the conditions typical of industrial milk powder baghouses, cohesive forces are governed primarily by liquid bridging between particles, due to melted fat (particularly at high temperatures) and softened lactose (at high humidity levels). As a range of milk powders with different compositions are produced commercially, the relative importance of lactose-based and fat-based cohesion differs between powder types. Cohesion promotes the formation of porous structures in the filter cake, improving the cake permeability. In skim milk powder (SMP), particle cohesion is dominated by softened lactose, and is highly moisture dependent. In the bench scale experiments conducted here, increasing the relative humidity from 6 % to 17 % decreased the specific cake resistance from 1. 69 x 10 ⁹ m. kg¯¹ to 8. 23 X 10 ⁸ m. kg¯¹, and decreased the proportion of powder adhering to the filter from 14 % of the total supplied powder to 3 %. The combination of these effects decreased the total resistance over the filter from 1. 09 X 10 ⁹m¯¹ to 1. 89 X 10 ⁸; m¯¹, an 83 % reduction. The low deposition at high humidity suggested that the porous cake structure formed at high humidity levels was fragile, so that deposited particles were prone to subsequent dislodgement, especially in areas where the shear velocity near the filter surface was high. In pilot scale experiments, the porous cake structure formed at high humidity was more easily removed from the filter bag, resulting in more effective pulse cleaning. It was concluded that particle cohesion promoted cake filtration over depth filtration, as particles tended to adhere to the cake surface immediately upon contact. As depth filtered particles are more difficult to remove, the shift toward cake filtration at high humidity improved the pulse cleaning performance. A high-fat milk protein concentrate (MPC) powder was also filtered on the bench scale apparatus. Particle cohesion in the MPC powder was dominated by liquid fat, and showed a clear dependence on temperature but not on humidity. Increasing the temperature from 30 °C to 90 °C caused the specific cake resistance of the MPC to decrease from 1. 06 x 10 ⁸ m⁻¹ to 3. 94 x 10 ⁷m⁻¹, a 63 % decrease. The deposition of MPC powder was unaffected by either temperature or humidity. Gravitational settling of particles in large baghouses was found to produce significant variations in the properties of the filter cake throughout the baghouse. Experimental results with the pilot scale baghouse found a strong decreasing trend in the particle size with increasing height in the baghouse, with the mean particle size decreasing from 117 μm at the bottom of the baghouse to only 31 μm near the top of the filter bag. The filter cake thickness also decreased sharply with height. Results from the CFD simulations indicated that in the pilot scale baghouse particles larger than 120 μm in diameter tend to fall out of the air flow and collect in the bottom of the baghouse, instead of depositing on the filter. While industrial baghouses tend to have a higher elutriation velocity than the pilot scale baghouse used in this study, the large size of industrial baghouses provides ample opportunity for particles to segregate on the basis of size. In addition, bench scale results indicated that high air velocities near the filter surface may cause particles to rebound from the filter. This may occur in industrial baghouses in the region near the inlet, where the air velocity is highest. The reverse pressure differential induced in the filter bag by a <b>cleaning</b> <b>pulse</b> was found to increase with distance from the cell plate. Positioning the nozzle too close to the bag opening created a low pressure zone just beneath the cell plate, where the pressure remained lower inside the bag than outside throughout the pulse. This may lead to poor cleaning at the top of the bag. In the pilot scale baghouse, positioning the nozzle at least 0. 7 m from the bag opening eliminated the low pressure zone. The optimum distance of 0. 7 m is is dependent on the nozzle type and bag diameter, but can be directly applied to recent industrial baghouse designs in the NZ dairy industry, which have the same nozzle type and bag diameter as the pilot scale baghouse. The design of the pulse cleaning system is important in achieving good baghouse performance. Increasing the pulse tank pressure on the pilot scale baghouse from 3. 5 bar to 6. 5 bar caused a 30 % reduction in the forward pressure differential after the pulse, while decreasing the pulse pressure below 3. 5 bar caused the pressure differentials to increase indefinitely. Altering the nozzle position had no effect on the overall pressure differentials, but did alter the local acceleration at different points on the filter bag during a pulse. CFD simulations indicated that decreasing the distance between the nozzle and the bag opening from 0. 7 m to 0. 1 m increased the overpressure at the bottom of the bag from 770 Pa to 3500 Pa, but this was offset by the appearance of the low pressure zone at the top of the bag as mentioned above. CFD simulations indicated that the diameter of the pulse nozzle altered both the mean bag overpressure generated by the pulse, and the distribution of the overpressure over the bag surface, with the low pressure zone at the top of the bag becoming longer at large nozzle diameters. The pulse duration was found to be unimportant, with experiments on the pilot scale baghouse finding that this had no effect on either the overall baghouse pressure differentials or the length of the low pressure zone at the top of the bag. The project has extended the understanding of milk powder baghouse performance by relating the moisture-dependent properties of lactose and the temperature-dependent melting of dairy fats to baghouse performance. The project has also provided a useful design tool in the form of the CFD model. The project demonstrates an opportunity for further CFD research into baghouse design, as the basic model developed here could now be modified to directly simulate large industrial baghouses. It is hoped that the results from this thesis will find application in the New Zealand Dairy Industry...|$|E

Correction of the {{influence}} of baseline artefacts and electrode polarisation on dielectric spectra. Bioelectrochemistry, 51 (1), 53 - 65 The deconvolution of biological dielectric spectra can be difficult enough with artefact-free spectra but is more problematic when machine baseline artefacts and electrode polarisation are present as well. In addition, these two sources of anomalies can be responsible for significant interference with dielectric biomass measurements made using one- or two-spot frequencies. The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop mathematical models of baseline artefacts and electrode polarisation which can be used to remove these anomalies from dielectric spectra in a way that can be easily implemented on-line and in real-time on the Biomass Monitor (BM). We show that both artefacts can be successfully removed in solutions of organic and inorganic ions; in animal cell and microbial culture media; and in yeast suspensions of varying biomass. The high quality of the compensations achieved were independent of whether gold and platinum electrodes were used; the electrode geometry; electrode fouling; current density; the type of BM; and of whether electrolytic <b>cleaning</b> <b>pulses</b> had been applied. In addition, the calibration experiments required could be done off-line using a simple aqueous KCl dilution series with the calibration constants being automatically calculated by a computer without the need for user intervention.

Importantly, application of baseline correction prior to polarisation correction allowed the latter's application to the whole conductance range of the BM.

Many of these com-pounds lack a chromophore, so UV-Vis detect ion is precluded. Amperometric detection is possible, but typically leads to diminished re-sponse due to fouling of the elec-trode surface (2). One PED tech-nique, pulsed amperometric detection (PAD), intersperses milli-second-long <b>cleaning</b> <b>pulses</b> with the detecting potential, thus prevent-ing electrode fouling. LC determination of carbohy-drates and polyalcohols {{is of interest}} to both the food and medical indus-tries. Analytes include simple sugars like glucose and galactose in plasma (3), oligosaccharides like glucuronic acid in urine (4), and complex sam-ples such as bile acids (5) and wood pulp (6). Although PAD seems com-plex, the epsilon ™ system makes this a relatively easy technique for the chromatographer. How PAD Works PAD is simply a series of potentials applied to the electrode.

This is a typical waveform suitable for detection of sugars at high pH on a gold electrode. The seriesof poten-tials lasts about a second, with typi-cally three or four discrete steps.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{integrate}} a failsafe {{system and to}} improve the cleaning intensity a new cleaning method was recently developed, the CPP (coupled pressure <b>pulse)</b> <b>cleaning</b> (Heidenreich et al. 2001). For the CPP method the cleaning system is directly coupled with the filter candles. One feature of this new technique is that the cleaning gas pressure exceeds the system pressure only by 0. 05 to 0. 1 MPa, whereas in case of conventional jet pulse systems two times the system pressure (at least 0. 6 MPa) is standard. The key advantage of the coupled pressure <b>pulse</b> <b>cleaning</b> is that a safety filter for each filter candle can be integrated in the clean gas side of the filter. Thus, a candle failure is not longer a serious problem. The integrated safety filter enables {{the operation of the}} filter system also in case a filter candle breaks.

The filter unit operates at 450 oC and consists of 1 exchangeable filter candle with reverse <b>pulse</b> <b>cleaning</b> system. Hot filtration experiments up to 7 hours were performed with beech wood as feedstock. It was possible to produce fast pyrolysis oils with a solid content below 0. 01 wt%. The additional residence time of the pyrolysis vapours and secondary vapour cracking on the filter cake caused an increase of non-condensable gases {{at the expense of}} organic liquid yield. The oils produced with hot filtration showed superior quality properties regarding viscosity than standard pyrolysis oils. The oils were analysed by rotational viscosimetry and gel permeation chromatography before and after accelerated aging. During filtration the separated particulates accumulate on the candle surface and build up the filter cake. The filter cake leads to an increase in pressure drop between the raw gas and the clean gas side of the filter candle. At a certain pressure drop the filter cake has to be removed by reverse <b>pulse</b> <b>cleaning</b> to regenerate the pressure drop. The experiments showed that successful pressure drop recovery was possible during the initial filtration cycles, thereafter further cycles showed minor pressure drop recovery and therefore a steady increase in differential pressure.

Tests were performed on two of the three qualified modules in the High-Temperature, High-Pressure facility at the Westinghouse Science and Technology Center. The first module failed on test when it expanded into the clamping device, causing dust leakage through the filter. The second module performed well for a cumulative 150 -hr test. It displayed excellent filtration capability during the test. The blowback <b>pulse</b> <b>cleaning</b> was highly effective, and the module apparently withstood the stresses induced by the periodic <b>pulse</b> <b>cleaning.</b> Testing of the module resumed, and when the flow of combustion gas through the filter was doubled, cracks developed and the test was concluded...|$|R

And the pressure distribution inside the filtering bag is also computed at different injecting times. According to the simulation result, this article has analyzed the influence of different distances between the air nozzle and the filtering bag and different injecting times on the dust-cleaning effect, and supplied theoretical basis to design the optimal pulse bag filter...|$|R

We propose to introduce the nano-fabrication technologies into laser-plasma interaction to explore the novel effects of micro-structures. We found out that not only laser-driven particle sources but also the laser pulse itself can be manipulated by specifically designed micro-cylinder and -tube targets, respectively. The proposal was supported by full- 3 D particle-in-cell simulations and successful proof-of-principle experiments for the first time. We believe this would open a way to manipulate relativistic laser-plasma interaction at the micro-size level...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{integrated}} gasification {{combined cycle}} (IGCC) and pressurized fluidized bed combustion (PFBC) power system requires both hot gas desulfurization and particulate filtration to improve system thermal efficiency and overall performance. Therefore, effective high temperature ceramic filters are indispensable key component {{in both of}} the advanced IGCC and PFBC coal based power systems to perform hot gas cleanup work. To meet the environmental particulate emission requirements and improve thermal efficiency, ceramic filters are mainly utilized to cleanup the hot gas particulate to protect downstream heat exchanger and gas turbine components from fouling and corrosion. The mechanical integrity of ceramic filters and an efficient dust cake removal system are the key issues for hot gas cleanup systems. The filters must survive combined stresses due to mechanical, thermal, chemical and steam attack throughout normal operations (cold back <b>pulse</b> <b>cleaning</b> jets), unexpected excessive ash accumulation, and the start up and shut down conditions. To evaluate the design and performance of ceramic filters, different long term filter testing programs were conducted. To fulfill this purpose, two Advanced Particle Filter (APF) systems were complete at Tidd PFBC Demonstration Plant, in Brilliant, Ohio in late 1990 {{as part of the}} Department of Energy's (DOE) Clean Coal Technology Program. But the most undesirable thing ever happened was the sudden functional and physical failures of filters prior to its designed life time. In Tidd APF filter vessel, twenty eight (28) filters failed one time. Significant research effort has been carried out to find out the causes that led to the early failure of filters. In this work, the studies are emphasized on the possible failure causes analysis of rigid ceramic candle filters. The objectives of this program were to provide an systematic study on the characterization of filters, material laboratory analysis on filter micro-structure, the dust cake dislodging mechanism and possible causes led to failures of ceramic filters. These research work includes 1) characterization on filter properties, 2) material laboratory investigation on cracked and un-cracked filter batches, 3) a thermal numerical simulation, 4) various physical testing on filter mechanical integrity and 5) the back <b>pulse</b> <b>cleaning</b> mechanism. These studies provide insights into variations of filter permeability, filter toughness against different mechanical loading impact, microstructure changes of filters, coal ash bridging and micro-thermal cracks induced during the cold back <b>pulse</b> <b>cleaning</b> process. To characterize the physical properties of used and unused ceramic filters, filter permeabilities and the pressure field of the gas stream were measured within a filter chamber with the use of fast response pressure transducers and an automatic data acquisition system. Used filters displayed non-uniform permeability distribution along its axis; and these variations developed asymmetric flow pattern in the filter chamber...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} the {{building}} of a multipass amplifier with <b>pulse</b> <b>cleaning</b> is sum-marized. The aim was to improve the temporal contrast of a femtosecond multi-terawatt laser system based on Chirped Pulse Amplification (CPA) in titanium sapphire at the Lund Laser Centre (LLC). The contrast of the system before this project was normally 1 about 10 − 8, meaning that if the pulses produced by the system have a focused intensity of 1020 W/cm 2 the background light has an intensity of 1012 W/cm 2. This high background level causes problems during experiments by interfering with the target be-fore the main pulse arrives. By seeding the regenerative amplifier with a higher energy the amplification can be lowered and thereby also lowering the production of Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE) which constitutes the majority of the background noise...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} our high-contrast laser based on high-contrast, high-energy seed injection, low-gain optical {{parametric}} chirped pulse amplification (OPCPA), and Nd:glass amplifiers, {{which can be}} used as the high-contrast front end of a high-power Nd:glass chirped pulse amplification (CPA) laser system. The energy of the stretched 1053 nm high-contrast seed pulse increases to 60 mu J by optimizing the frequency doubling crystal in the <b>pulse</b> <b>cleaning</b> device. After passing through a two-stage low-gain OPCPA, a 2 -pass 2 -rod Nd:glass amplifier, and a compressor the amplified pulse of 131 mJ/ 282 fs is achieved. The third-order correlation scanning measurement shows that the pulse contrast in the tens of ps range is about 10 (- 7) - 10 (- 8). With the high-contrast seed passing through the stretcher and compressor only, the contrast measurement indicates that the stretching-compressing process leads mainly to the contrast degradation of the amplified pulse...|$|R
40|$|Ion {{acceleration}} from short pulse laser interactions at intensities of 2 x 10 (21) Wcm(- 2) was studied experimentally under a {{wide variety}} of parameters, including laser contrast, incidence angle, and target thickness. Trends in maximum proton energy were observed, as well as evidence of improvement in the acceleration gradients by using dual plasma mirrors over traditional <b>pulse</b> <b>cleaning</b> techniques. Extremely high efficiency acceleration gradients were produced, accelerating both the contaminant layer and high charge state ions from the bulk of the target. Two dimensional particle-in-cell simulations enabled the study of the influence of scale length on submicron targets, where hydrodynamic expansion affects the rear surface as well as the front. Experimental evidence of larger electric fields for sharp density plasmas is observed in simulation results as well for such targets, where target ions are accelerated without the need for contaminant removal.

40|$|In {{order to}} extend the {{investigation}} of laser-assisted cleaning of ITER-relevant first mirror materials to the picosecond regime, a commercial laser system delivering 10 picosecond pulses at 355 nm at a frequency of up to 1 MHz {{has been used to}} investigate the ablation of mixed aluminium (oxide) / tungsten (oxide) layers deposited on poly- and nanocrystalline molybdenum as well as nanocrystalline rhodium mirrors. Characterization before and after cleaning using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and spectrophotometry shows heavy dust formation, resulting in a degradation of the reflectivity. Cleaning using a 5 nanosecond pulses at 350 and 532 nm, on the other hand, proved very promising. The structure of the film remnants suggests that in this case buckling was the underlying removal mechanism rather than ablation. Repeated coating and <b>cleaning</b> using nanosecond <b>pulses</b> is demonstrated. Comment: Accepted in Fusion Science and Technology. Fusion Science and Technology 201...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the mechanical properties of the cylindrical ceramic filter elements under vibration. These vibrations with different frequencies and amplitudes occur particularly in up/down-turning periods and during <b>pulse</b> <b>cleaning</b> but even under regular operation conditions. The geometry of a filter element with a wall thickness of about 10 mm, an outer diameter of 60 mm and an overall length of about 1500 mm with a porous support structure is not typical for ceramic materials. Therefore the risk of mechanical fatigue is high. As a result of the theoretical calculations an optimization of the element geometry shall be achieved. The optimization has to take into account the possibilities for an industrial fabrication of the elements, the possibility of a substitution in existing filter systems and of course a high filter area similar to the usual geometry has to be guaranteed...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of compact high‐intensity lasers, {{made possible by}} the technique of chirped pulse amplification, is reviewed. This includes the complexities of high‐power laser implementation, such as the generation of short <b>pulses,</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>cleaning,</b> wide‐bandwidth amplification, temporal stretching and compression, and the requirements for high‐average powers. Details of specific solid‐state laser systems are given. Some applications of these lasers to short‐pulse coherent short‐wavelength [x‐ray ultraviolet (XUV) ] sources are also reviewed. This includes several nonlinear effects observed by focusing a subpicosecond laser into a gas; namely, an anomalous scaling of harmonic generation in atomic media, an upper limit on the conversion efficiency of relativistic harmonics in a plasma, and the observation of short‐pulse self‐focusing and multifoci formation. Finally, the effects of large ponderomotive pressures (100 Mbars) in short‐pulse high‐intensity laser–plasma interactions are discussed, with relevance both to recombination x‐ray lasers and a novel method of igniting thermonuclear fusion...|$|R
