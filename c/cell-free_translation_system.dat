40|$|Meiotic {{maturation}} stimulates {{a change}} in the translation of stored mRNAs: mRNAs encoding proteins needed for growth of oocytes are translated before meiotic maturation, whereas those encoding proteins required for cleavage are translated after meiotic maturation. Studies of translational regulation during meiotic maturation have been limited by the lack of translationally active cell-free supernatants. Starfish oocytes are ideal for preparing <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> <b>systems</b> because experimental application of the hormone 1 -methyladenine induces their maturation, synchronizing meiosis. We have prepared such systems from both immature and mature oocytes of starfish. Changes in protein synthesis rates and the specificity of proteins synthesized in these <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> supernatants mimic those seen in vivo. Supernatants both from immature and mature oocytes have a high capacity to initiate new translation because 90 % of the proteins made are newly initiated from mRNAs. Cell-free supernatants from mature oocytes have a much higher rate of initiation of translation than those from immature oocytes and use the 43 S preinitiation complexes more efficiently in initiation of translation. Similarly, we have shown that mRNAs and initiation factors are rate limiting in <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> <b>systems</b> prepared from immature oocytes. In addition, <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> <b>systems</b> prepared from immature oocytes are only slightly, if at all, inhibitory to <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> <b>systems</b> from mature oocytes. Thus, soluble inhibitors, if they exist, are rapidly converted by cell-free supernatants from mature oocytes. The similarities between translation in our starfish <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> <b>systems</b> and in intact oocytes suggests that the <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> <b>systems</b> will be useful tools for further studies of maturation events and translational control during meiosis...|$|R

Incorporation of amino acids into protein was effectively inhibited by G- 418 in the microM concentration range. The inhibition pattern obtained was not uniform. The synthesis of polypeptides with higher molecular weights was more inhibited than that of smaller polypeptides. An identical inhibition pattern within a similar range of concentrations was obtained with cycloheximide, a known elongation inhibitor. Translation activity was abolished when the wheat-germ 80 S ribosomes were removed and could be partially reconstructed upon addition of the ribosomes. Incubation with G- 418 prior to isolation yielded ribosomes defective in their reconstruction ability. The inhibition pattern was not uniform and exhibited again the same relationship between {{the size of a}} polypeptide and the extent of inhibition of its synthesis.

40|$|A novel <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> <b>system</b> is {{described}} in which template-mRNA molecules were captured onto solid surfaces to simultaneously synthesize and immobilize proteins in a more native-state form. This technology comprises a novel solid-phase approach to cell-free translation and RNA–protein fusion techniques. A newly constructed biotinylated linker-DNA which enables puromycin-assisted RNA–protein fusion is ligated to the 3 ′ ends of the mRNA molecules to attach the mRNA-template on a streptavidin-coated surface and further to enable the subsequent reactions of translation and RNA–protein fusion on surface. The protein products are therefore directly immobilized onto solid surfaces and furthermore were discovered to adopt a more native state with proper protein folding and superior biological activity compared with conventional liquid-phase approaches. We further validate this approach via the production of immobilized green fluorescent protein (GFP) on microbeads and by the production and assay of aldehyde reductase (ALR) enzyme with 4 -fold or more activity. The approach developed in this study may enable to embrace {{the concept of the}} transformation of ‘RNA chip-to-protein chip’ using a solid-phase <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> <b>system</b> and thus to the development of high-throughput microarray platform in the field of functional genomics and in vitro evolution...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{show that}} a simple <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> <b>system</b> from Escherichia coli, {{programmed}} with phage MS 2 RNA, is able to infect F+ E. coli cells. The plaques appearing on the E. coli host strain are morphologically indistinguishable from those derived from normal phage MS 2 infection. This effect is strictly translation-dependent, since an incomplete translation system or the system inhibited by antibiotics leads to no infection. The cellfree based infection is maximal under conditions favouring the highest synthesis of maturation protein (one of the four phage-encoded proteins). The infection is abolished when RNase A or trypsin treatment is included before addition of cells. Similarly, due to RNA and maturation protein degradation, the continued incubation of the translation mixture under protein synthesis conditions significantly decreases infectivity. These findings suggest the formation of ‘minimal infectious units’, simple complexes of MS 2 RNA and maturation protein. Here we describe the first example of bacteriophage infectious unit formation directly performed in a <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> <b>system.</b> A possible application of this phenomenon might be the construction of newly designed RNA vector delivery systems and, moreover, could be an approach for molecular evolution studies...|$|E

40|$|The {{idea that}} in vitro protein {{synthesis}} {{should be performed}} under conditions of continuous inflow of feed and removal of waste, {{rather than in a}} test-tube with a fixed capacity, was first realized in <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> <b>systems</b> with matrix-immobilized template polynucleotides in flow-through columns (solid-phase <b>translation</b> <b>systems)</b> [1, 2].

At about the same time (1988 - 1989) a simplified version of the continuous cell-free system was devised: incubation of the translation mixture in a simple dialysis bag was proposed for replenishing substrates and removing low-molecular-weight products by diffusional exchange across the membrane during the protein synthesis reaction [5]. Thus, the continuous-flow cell-free (CFCF) technique and the continuous-exchange cell-free (CECF) method were brought into use as two main formats of long-lived, high-productive continuous systems for in vitro protein syntheses.

40|$|SummarySRP is {{essential}} for targeting nascent chains to the endoplasmic reticulum, and it delays nascent chain elongation in <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> <b>systems.</b> However, {{the significance of this}} function has remained unclear. We show that efficient protein translocation into the ER is incompatible with normal cellular translation rates due to rate-limiting concentrations of SRP receptor (SR). We complemented mammalian cells depleted of SRP 14 by expressing mutant versions of the protein lacking the elongation arrest function. The absence of a delay caused inefficient targeting of preproteins leading to defects in secretion, depletion of proteins in the endogenous membranes, and reduced cell growth. The detrimental effects were reversed by either reducing the cellular protein synthesis rate or increasing SR expression. SRP therefore ensures that nascent chains remain translocation competent during the targeting time window dictated by SR. Since SRP-signal sequence affinities vary, the delay may also regulate which proteins are preferentially targeted...|$|R
