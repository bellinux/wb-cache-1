30|$|An {{analysis}} {{was performed on the}} climatic responses of the radial growth of Larix gmelinii (Rupr.) Rupr. on contrasting north-facing and south-facing slopes in Tura, central Siberia. We developed <b>chronologies</b> <b>of</b> tree-ring width for four plots, designated as north-upper, northlower, south-upper, and south-lower. Both residual and standard <b>chronologies</b> <b>of</b> tree-ring widths exhibited a significant positive correlation with temperature from the end of May until early June in all four plots. The <b>chronologies</b> <b>of</b> ring width did not reveal any major difference in the response to temperature among the four plots. The standard <b>chronologies</b> <b>of</b> ring widths on the north-facing slope were negatively correlated with precipitation during the winter (October–April) and in early and mid-May, whereas the residual chronologies did not reveal clear relationships with precipitation during the winter and May. The significant correlation between ring width and temperature from the end of May until early June indicates that temperatures in springtime {{play a significant role in}} the radial growth of L. gmelinii. The negative correlations between standard <b>chronologies</b> <b>of</b> tree-ring width and precipitation in the winter and in May on the north-facing slope indicate that lowfrequency fluctuations in snowfall have negative effects on the radial growth. However, these effects vary and depend on the microscale topography.|$|R

5|$|The Minoan {{eruption}} {{is a key}} {{marker for}} the Bronze Age <b>chronology</b> <b>of</b> the Eastern Mediterranean world. It provides a fixed point for aligning the entire <b>chronology</b> <b>of</b> the second millennium BCE in the Aegean, {{as evidence of the}} eruption is found throughout the region. Despite the evidence, the exact date of the eruption has been difficult to determine. Archaeologists have traditionally placed it at approximately 1500 BCE. Radiocarbon dates, including analysis of an olive branch buried beneath a lava flow from the volcano that gave a date between 1627 BCE and 1600 BCE (95% confidence interval), suggest an eruption date more than a century earlier than suggested by archaeologists. Thus, the radiocarbon dates and the archaeological dates are in substantial disagreement.|$|E

5|$|As a result, Maslama {{launched}} {{another attack}} aimed at Tyana, with his nephew al-Abbas ibn al-Walid as co-commander.
