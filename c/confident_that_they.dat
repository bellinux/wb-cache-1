5|$|Cienfuegos led electors {{that were}} part of the {{imperial}} party in an attempt to elect Giulio Piazza. Piazza was almost elected on May 13, but was short by four votes. The electors were <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would be able to elect him, because more cardinals were arriving to participate in the conclave, and it became public in Rome that Piazza was likely to be the new pope. Albani did not support this because he had not {{been a part of the}} negotiations despite being the original elector to suggest Piazza, and undermined his election by proposing Vincenzo Orsini as an alternate candidate.|$|E
5|$|Receipt of Banking Services: A Lebanese Identity Card holder {{can use the}} Lebanese Identity Card as {{identity}} verification document when opening bank account, withdrawing money from the bank or receiving money transfers in the Republic of Lebanon. It is easier for a Lebanese Identity Card holder to also take loan from the bank whether you work in an identifiable institution or not. This is because their identity can be easily verified and the banks are <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can be traced {{in the event of}} loan default based on their PIN or biometric information stored on the Lebanese Identity Card.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian Army, the BEF and the French 1st Army, in a domino effect, was ordered/forced {{to retire}} on 16 May to avoid their {{southern}} flanks from being turned by the German armoured forces advancing through the French Ardennes and the German 6th Army advancing through Gembloux. The Belgian Army {{was holding the}} German Fourteenth Army on the KW-line, along with the French 7th and British armies. Had {{it not been for}} the collapse of the French 2nd Army at Sedan, the Belgians were <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could have checked the German advance.|$|E

30|$|When {{immigrant}} customers {{undertake a}} dental treatment {{in their native}} country (e.g. less-developed one), they may initially be uncertain and not <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> the service <b>they</b> receive is of good quality [52]. This is especially the case of dental tourism in less-developed countries, where low price {{is one of the}} main reasons for customers to use this service. In this circumstance, a high-quality interaction between a dentist and a customer would facilitate the social exchange and mutual understanding, leading to the development of trust in customers [53]. In turn, when customers trust in the dentist and his service, <b>they</b> are more <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> the service <b>they</b> receive is worth the money, leading to better price value.|$|R
50|$|Divers {{should not}} be deterred by peer {{pressure}} from declining a dive when they are ill prepared, and they should not {{allow themselves to be}} pressured by service providers such as boat skippers and divemasters into accepting responsibility for the safety of another diver if they do not feel <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> both <b>they</b> and the other diver can deal adequately with any reasonably foreseeable problem that may occur during the dive.|$|R
5|$|Sherman and Hayes {{agreed to}} {{stockpile}} gold {{in preparation for}} the exchange of greenbacks for specie. The Act remained unpopular in some quarters, leading to four attempts to repeal it in the Senate and fourteen in the House—all unsuccessful. By this time, public confidence in the Treasury had grown to the extent that a dollar in gold was worth only $1.05 in greenbacks. Once the public was <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could redeem greenbacks for gold, few actually did so; when the Act took effect in 1879, only $130,000 out of the $346,000,000 outstanding dollars in greenbacks were redeemed. Greenbacks were now at parity with gold dollars, and the nation had, {{for the first time since}} the Civil War, a unified monetary system.|$|E
5|$|Eventually NSB felt <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{had found}} a {{technical}} solution that would be satisfactory, and ordered another six units to allow all trains on the Dovre, Bergen and Sørland Lines to be hauled with the class. Units 2227–2232 were delivered in 1987, and put into regular service on the Sørland Line. Although better than the first series, the second series was also prone to technical problems, and never entered regular service on the Bergen Line. During the 1990s, they were also put into service on the regional rail services on the Vestfold and Gjøvik Lines. The units were never well-liked by NSB, {{in part because of}} the bad name the first series had given, and partly because the number of available units was unpredictable. It also took a while for NSB to discover that asynchronous locomotives needed to be operated differently. The locomotives had been designed to haul a six-car train, but NSB regularly needed to haul eight-car trains, and therefore instead used the more powerful El 16.|$|E
5|$|The Gliders {{returned}} to the Marshmallow the next day for a match against Canada, another team considered a strong chance for a medal, {{in front of a}} capacity crowd of 7,200. The Gliders squandered early opportunities, and Canada won the first quarter 20–12. Strong defensive play by Nott and Gauci helped the Gliders reverse this in the second, and left Canada with only a one-point 33–32 lead at half time. The second half saw Canada slowly increase their lead, keeping tied with Australia 4–4 {{in the first half of}} third, 6–4 in the last half of the third, 6–4 in the first half of the fourth, and 8–6 in the last half of the fourth. Australia's top players were Crispin, who had 13 points and 15 rebounds; Merritt, who earned 16 points; and Chaplin, with eight points, five rebounds and seven assists. The loss raised the prospect that Australia might not make the finals at all, but Crispin remained <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could.|$|E
60|$|Frank's face {{became more}} serious {{than it had been}} during the {{previous}} search, as soon as they took up the double track across the fields. Before, he had felt absolutely <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> whatever <b>they</b> might find it could only tend to clear Julian from this terrible accusation; now, upon the contrary, he feared <b>that</b> any discovery <b>they</b> might make would confirm his suspicions that evil had befallen him. Scarcely a word was spoken as they passed along the fields.|$|R

5|$|The {{second issue}} {{concerned}} United States Notes (commonly called greenbacks), {{a form of}} fiat currency first issued during the Civil War. The government accepted these notes as valid for payment of taxes and tariffs, but unlike ordinary dollars, they were not redeemable in gold. The Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875 required the treasury to redeem any outstanding greenbacks in gold, thus retiring them from circulation and restoring a single, gold-backed currency. Sherman agreed with Hayes's favorable opinion of the Act, and stockpiled gold {{in preparation for the}} exchange of greenbacks for gold. Once the public was <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could redeem greenbacks for specie (gold), however, few did so; when the Act took effect in 1879, only $130,000 out of the $346,000,000 outstanding dollars in greenbacks were actually redeemed. Together with the Bland–Allison Act, the successful specie resumption effected a workable compromise between inflationists and hard money men and, as the world economy began to improve, agitation for more greenbacks and silver coinage quieted down for the rest of Hayes's term in office.|$|E
5|$|The track {{had been}} patched up {{prior to the}} weekend's racing using a {{synthetic}} rubber compound, and it had remained secure throughout the practice and qualifying sessions, {{as well as the}} Grand-Am and Indy Lights races. However, the Dallara DW12's aerodynamic ground force effects acted to pull the compound out. After assessing the track conditions, {{the decision was made to}} attempt to repair the track and restart the race. Marshalls and track workers started to pull the loose strips up from the track, and a quick drying concrete was used to fill the troughs. The repairs were held up for a short time when a crew was despatched to collect more of the concrete, as the on-site resources had been used up, but eventually the race director was happy the race could restart. Kanaan and Power drove around to survey the repairs, acting as driver representatives, and although Kanaan particularly did not sound <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would hold up, they agreed to try and continue racing. There was some confusion about the rules of the restart; no repairs were allowed, and the teams could change tires, but had to remain on the same compound. This led to J.R. Hildebrand suffering a one lap penalty as his car required repair work, and a number of drivers being angered at having to stay on the harder tires, which were the slower compound.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{signed for}} League Two team Notts County on a two-year {{contract}} on 22 July 2009, {{on the same}} day that Sven-Göran Eriksson arrived at the club as director of football. He scored a hat-trick on his debut in a 5–0 victory over Bradford City on the opening day of the season. He then got his second hat-trick against Northampton Town in a 5–2 home win on 12 September. He claimed his third hat-trick of the campaign on 28 December during a 4–1 win over Burton Albion at the Pirelli Stadium. However the club endured a turbulent time, with manager Ian McParland sacked and replaced by Hans Backe, who himself resigned after Qadbak Investments proved unable to fund Backe's wages. New owner Ray Trew appointed Steve Cotterill as manager, and County entered April ten points behind league leaders Rochdale, though Hughes remained <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could reduce the deficit and win the league. On 17 April, Hughes scored two goals in a 4–1 victory over Morecambe as County won promotion to League One. He was named as League Two's Player of the Month in April. On 1 May, Hughes added another two goals in County's final home game of the season, making him the first Notts player to score 30 league goals since Tommy Lawton in the 1949–50 season. He finished as the division's top-scorer in 2009–10 with 30 league goals in 39 games, and was named on the PFA Team of the Year alongside teammates Kasper Schmeichel and Ben Davies. County won the league by a ten-point margin. In July 2010, Hughes signed a one-year extension to his contract that would see him at Meadow Lane until the summer of 2012.|$|E
50|$|The {{evidence}} against Wetter is inconsistent; {{and the two}} writers are <b>confident</b> <b>that,</b> if <b>they</b> can expose Wetter {{as a victim of}} redneck justice, their story will be a potential Pulitzer Prize winner. However, during the path of the prize, tricks of the journalist's trade are played, corners are cut, facts are fudged that later cause Jack James to do a little investigating for his own, which shows some small inconsistencies that had been ignored earlier.|$|R

25|$|According to André Sellier, a French {{historian}} and {{survivor of the}} Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp, Heinrich Himmler had von Braun come to his Feldkommandostelle Hochwald HQ in East Prussia in February 1944. To increase his power-base within the Nazi regime, Himmler was conspiring to use Kammler {{to gain control of}} all German armament programs, including the V-2 program at Peenemünde. He therefore recommended that von Braun work more closely with Kammler to solve the problems of the V-2. Von Braun claimed to have replied that the problems were merely technical and he was <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would be solved with Dornberger's assistance.|$|E
25|$|The Hanthawaddy command {{nevertheless}} was <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could pacify {{the entire}} Upper Burma countryside. At first the strategy seemed to work.

The Hanthawaddy officer stationed at Singu, about 30 miles north of Ava, sent a detachment of 50 men to secure allegiance of the Mu valley. Alaungpaya personally led forty of his best men to meet the detachment at Halin, south of Shwebo, and wiped them out. It was 20 April 1752 (Thursday, 4th waxing of Kason 1114 ME).|$|E

25|$|Prior to the {{acceptance}} of an employment offer, the prospective employee usually {{has the opportunity to}} negotiate the terms of the offer. This primarily focuses on salary, but extends to benefits, work arrangements, and other amenities as well. Negotiating salary can potentially lead the prospective employee to a higher salary. In fact, a 2009 study of employees indicated that those who negotiated salary saw an average increase of $4,913 from their original salary offer. In addition, the employer is able to feel more <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have hired an employee with strong interpersonal skills and the ability to deal with conflict. Negotiating salary will thus likely yield an overall positive outcome for both sides of the bargaining table.|$|E
25|$|In the {{academic}} world, plagiarism by students is usually considered {{a very serious}} offense that can result in punishments such as a failing grade on the particular assignment, the entire course, or even being expelled from the institution. Generally, the punishment increases as a person enters higher institutions of learning. The seriousness with which academic institutions address student plagiarism may be tempered by a recognition that students may not fully understand what plagiarism is. A 2015 study showed that students who were new to university study {{did not have a}} good understanding of even the basic requirements of how to attribute sources in written academic work, yet students were very <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> understood what referencing and plagiarism are. The same students also had a lenient view of how plagiarism should be penalised.|$|E

Both were aiming at Marshall Teague's track record from the previous week, and likewise hoping to set a closed-course speed record. Both drivers took hot laps, but neither were fast enough to eclipse Teague's lap time, hampered largely due to strong, gusty winds. Car owner Art Lathrope, in fact, instructed his drivers not to go all out, not wanting anyone to risk getting injured. He was <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> when <b>they</b> returned in March, with more preparation, speeds would be up another 10 mph.
