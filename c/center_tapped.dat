50|$|A {{drawback}} of {{the voltage}} mode operation {{is that the}} stress on switch transistors is high during the cross over time, when both the voltage and current are high. This drawback is alleviated by using current mode operation. This is achieved by inserting an inductor in the transformer <b>center</b> <b>tap</b> supply.

40|$|In today's industry, it is {{necessary}} to convert power for equipment used in environments where dissimilar voltages and frequencies are the norm. Static frequency converters or industrial power supplies are used for converting either 50 Hz or 60 Hz utility line power to 400 Hz power. They are more efficient than motor-generator sets. In addition, they offer harmonic cancellation, power factor correction, phase conversion, voltage conversion with balanced, smooth, and controlled power output.
