5|$|<b>Capital</b> <b>punishment</b> is sanctioned in the United States {{for certain}} federal and {{military}} crimes, {{and used in}} 31 states. No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing {{in part to a}} U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down arbitrary imposition of the death penalty.

Since the decision there have been more than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma.

5|$|By {{virtue of}} a Hindu belief that {{killing of a}} brahmin (Bramhatya) was a sin, <b>capital</b> <b>punishment</b> was not {{applicable}} to them. Upper caste kshatriyas (satkshatriya) were also exempt from <b>capital</b> <b>punishment</b> due to their higher position in the caste system. Severe crimes committed were punishable by the severing of a foot or hand. Contemporary literary sources reveal up to ten castes in the Hindu caste system; three among kshatriya, three among brahmin, two among vaishya and two among shudras. Family laws permitted a wife or daughter or surviving relatives of a deceased person to claim properties such as his home, land, grain, money etc. {{if there were no}} male heirs. If no claimants to the property existed, the state took possession of these properties as Dharmadeya (charitable asset). Intercaste marriage, child marriage, marriage of a boy to maternal uncles daughter, Svayamvara marriage (where the bride garlands her choice of a groom from among many aspirants) were all in vogue. Memorials containing hero stones (virkal) were erected for fallen heroes and the concerned family received monetary aid for maintenance of the memorial.|$|E
