40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to design, construct, test and operate a novel circulating fluid bed fast pyrolysis reactor system for production of liquids from biomass. The novelty lies in incorporating an integral <b>char</b> <b>combustor</b> to provide autothermal operation. A reactor design methodology was devised which correlated input parameters to process variables, namely temperature, heat transfer and gas/vapour residence time, for both the <b>char</b> <b>combustor</b> and biomass pyrolyser. From this methodology a CFB reactor was designed with integral char combustion for 10 kg/h biomass throughput. A full-scale cold model of the CFB unit was constructed and tested to derive suitable hydrodynamic relationships and performance constraints. Early difficulties encountered with poor solids circulation and inefficient product recovery were overcome {{by a series of}} modifications. A total of 11 runs in a pyrolysis mode were carried out with a maximum total liquids yield of 61. 50 % wt on a maf biomass basis, obtained at 500 °C and with 0. 46 s gas/vapour residence time. This could be improved by improved vapour recovery by direct quenching up to an anticipated 75 % wt on a moisture-and-ash-free biomass basis. The reactor provides a very high specific throughput of 1. 12 - 1. 48 kg/hm 2 and the lowest gas-to-feed ratio of 1. 3 - 1. 9 kg gas/kg feed compared to other fast pyrolysis processes based on pneumatic reactors and has a good scale-up potential. These features should provide significant capital cost reduction. Results to date suggest that the process is limited by the extent of char combustion. Future work will address resizing of the <b>char</b> <b>combustor</b> to increase overall system capacity, improvement in solid separation and substantially better liquid recovery. Extended testing will provide better evaluation of steady state operation and provide data for process simulation and reactor modeling...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} gas-solid {{reaction}} systems which take place simultaneously {{in a single}} reactor, such as coal gasification. By splitting the reactions, high concentrated gases can be obtained without separation processes. Dual fluidized bed was proposed for this purpose. Similarly, simultaneous adsorption/desorption systems with dry sorbent for CO 2 capture and the gasification reaction system with a <b>char</b> <b>combustor</b> and a gasifier separately were developed. For improving gas and solid mixing efficiencies of the dual fluidized beds, a hitherto unknown partitioned fluidized bed (PFB) is proposed. A basic concept of PFB is that lower parts between two separated fluidized beds are linked (opened), whereas upper parts are blocked by walls. Solid mixing occurs in lower parts with preventing gas mixing. The solid residence time becomes longer than that of dual fluidized bed and the high conversion of solid can be obtained. In this study, the gas and the solid mixing behaviors were investigated in three partitioned fluidized beds (left, center and right). The size of each fluidized bed is...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to design heat integrated, cost-effective and cleaner {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) generation plant from low cost 4 th generation biomass waste feedstocks. The novelty lies in the development of systematic site-wide heat recovery and integration strategies amongst biomass integrated gasification combined cycle processes so as to offset the low heating value of the biomass waste feedstocks. For the biomass waste based CHP plant technical and economic analysis, the process was based on low cost agricultural wastes like straws as the biomass feedstock and further established for a more predominant biomass feedstock, wood. The process was modeled using the ASPEN simulator. Three conceptual flowsheets were proposed, based on the integration of the flue gas from the <b>char</b> <b>combustor,</b> which was separately carried out from the steam gasification of biomass volatalised gases and tars, and carbon dioxide removal strategies. The cost of energy production included detailed levelised discounted cash flow analysis and was found to be strongly influenced by the cost of feedstock. Based on a combined energy generation of ~ 340 - 370 MW using straw wastes priced at 35. 3 £/t or 40 Euro/t, with 8. 5 % and 8. 61 % by mass moisture and ash contents respectively, the cost of electricity generation was 4. 59 p/kWh and 5. 14 p/kWh for the cases without and wit...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{turbulence}} on the heterogeneous (solid-fluid) reactions of solid particles is studied numerically with Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS). A simplified reaction system is used, where the solid-fluid reaction {{is represented by}} a single isothermal reaction step. It is found that, due to the clustering of particles by the isotropic turbulence, the overall reaction rate is entirely controlled by the turbulence for large Damköhler numbers. The particle clustering significantly slows down the reaction rate for increasing Damköhler numbers which reaches an asymptotic limit that can be analytically derived. This implies {{that the effect of}} turbulence on heterogeneously reacting particles should be included in models that are used in CFD simulations of e. g. <b>char</b> burnout in <b>combustors</b> or gasifiers. Such a model, based on the chemical and turbulent time scales, is here proposed for the heterogeneous reaction rate in the presence of turbulence.

40|$|The {{technical}} and economic feasibility of producing hydrogen from biomass {{by means of}} indirectly heated gasification and steam reforming was studied. A detailed process model was developed in ASPEN Plus{trademark} to perform material and energy balances. The results of this simulation were used to size and cost major pieces of equipment from which {{the determination of the}} necessary selling price of hydrogen was made. A sensitivity analysis was conducted on the process to study hydrogen price as a function of biomass feedstock cost and hydrogen production efficiency. The gasification system used for this study was the Battelle Columbus Laboratory (BCL) indirectly heated gasifier. The heat necessary for the endothermic gasification reactions is supplied by circulating sand from a <b>char</b> <b>combustor</b> to the gasification vessel. Hydrogen production was accomplished by steam reforming the product synthesis gas (syngas) in a process based on that used for natural gas reforming. Three process configurations were studied. Scheme 1 is the full reforming process, with a primary reformer similar to a process furnace, followed by a high temperature shift reactor and a low temperature shift reactor. Scheme 2 uses only the primary reformer, and Scheme 3 uses the primary reformer and the high temperature shift reactor. A pressure swing adsorption (PSA) system is used in all three schemes to produce a hydrogen product pure enough to be used in fuel cells. Steam is produced through detailed heat integration and is intended to be sold as a by-product...|$|E
40|$|The quoted {{two-stage}} dual {{fluidized bed}} gasification (T-DFBG) devises {{the use of}} a two-stage fluidized bed (TFB) to replace the single-stage bubbling fluidized bed gasifier involved in the normally encountered dual fluidized bed gasification (N-DFBG) systems. By feeding fuel into the lower stage of the TFB, this lower stage functions as a fuel gasifier similar to that in the N-DFBG so that the upper stage of the TFB works to upgrade the produced gas in the lower stage and meanwhile to suppress the possible elutriation of fuel particles fed into the freeboard of the lower-stage bed. The heat carrier particles (HCPs) circulated from the <b>char</b> <b>combustor</b> enter first the upper stage of the TFB to facilitate the gas upgrading reactions occurring therein, and the particles are in turn forwarded into the lower stage to provide endothermic heat for fuel pyrolysis and gasification reactions. Consequently, with T-DFBG it is hopeful to increase gasification efficiency and decrease tar content in the produced gas. This anticipation was corroborated through gasifying dry coffee grounds in two 5. 0 kg/h experimental setups configured according to the principles of T-DFBG and N-DFBG, respectively. In comparison with the N-DFBG case, the test according to T-DFBG increased, the fuel C conversion and cold gas efficiency by about 7 % and decreased tar content in the produced gas by up to 25 % under similar reaction conditions. Test results demonstrated also that all these upgrading effects via adopting T-DFBG were more pronounced when a Ca-based additive was blended into the fuel. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The main {{operational}} {{characteristics of a}} novel gasifier operating in the CFB mode are outlined in this paper, based on the experimental results from a total of 11 runs in the pyrolysis mode. The operation runs constituted the main experiments in the CFB reactor, carried out to derive meaningful mass balance and additional operational data for the CFB pyrolyzer. The experiments were conducted in varying operating conditions determined by the most important parameters, i. e., biomass flowrate, fluidizing gas flowrate, air factor, initial bed inventory), temperature in the CFB riser, vapor residence time and nominal air factor - or equivalence ratio, Sb. The results obtained showed that the reactor configuration successfully operated as a biomass fast pyrolysis system to maximize liquid yields reaching 61. 50 wt% on a maf biomass basis, with the novel feature of providing for autothermal operation at 500 °C and with 0. 46 s gas-vapor residence time, by utilizing the by-product char energy content in a single reactor. The reactor provides a very high specific throughput of 1. 12 - 1. 48 kg/h m 2 and the lowest gas-to-feed ratio of 1. 3 - 1. 9 kg gas/kg feed compared to other fast pyrolysis processes based on pneumatic reactors and has a good scale-up potential, providing significant capital cost reduction.

On the basis of the carbon capture value assigned by the Carbon Credits Trading scheme, a much constrained viable price of 22 £/t of such agricultural waste feedstocks for CHP generation was obtained, while up to 60 £/t of waste feedstocks can be economically viable under the UK Climate Change Levy, respectively...|$|E
