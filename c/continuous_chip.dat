The characteristics of the segmented chip produced by laser-assisted machining (LAM) {{in terms of the}} tooth depth and tooth spacing were strongly dependent on the cutting speed and laser power.

Titanium alloys are {{desirable}} {{materials for}} aerospace industry {{because of their}} excellent combination of high specific strength, lightweight, fracture resistant characteristics, and general corrosion resistance.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{presents}} an in-process monitoring and identification of cutting states in turning process inorder {{to realize the}} intelligent machine tools. Design/methodology/approach: The developed method utilizes the power spectrum density, or PSD ofdynamic cutting force measured during the cutting. The experimentally obtained results suggested that there arebasically three types of patterns of PSD when the cutting states are the <b>continuous</b> <b>chip</b> formation, the brokenchip formation, and the chatter. The broken chip formation is desired to realize safe and reliable machining. Themethod proposed introduces three ratios, which are calculated and obtained by taking the ratios of cumulativePSD for a certain frequency range of three dynamic cutting force components corresponding to those three statesof cutting, to classify the cutting states. The algorithm was developed to calculate the values of three ratiosduring the process {{in order to obtain}} the proper threshold values for classification of the cutting states. Findings: The method developed has been proved by series of cutting experiments that the states of cutting arewell identified regardless of the cutting conditions. The broken chips are easily obtained by changing the cuttingconditions during the processes referring to the algorithm developed. Practical implications: There are still not many systems being used in practice mainly {{due to the lack of}} generalapplicability such as a requirement of automated machining systems regardless of the cutting conditions.

The slipping angle in the segmented chip was 55, which was higher than that in the <b>continuous</b> <b>chip</b> (38 degrees).

The peak of the cyclic force when producing segmented chips was 1. 18 times that producing the <b>continuous</b> <b>chip.</b> The undeformed surface length in the segmented chip was found to increase linearly with the feed rate but was independent of cutting speed and depth of cut. The cyclic force frequency increased linearly with cutting speed and decreased inversely with feed rate. The cutting force increased with the feed rate and depth of cut at constant cutting speed due to the large volume of material being removed. The increase in cutting force with increasing cutting speed from 10 to 16 and 57 to 75 m/min was attributed to the strain rate hardening at low and high strain rates, respectively. The decrease in cutting force with increasing cutting speed outside these speed ranges was due to the thermal softening of the material. The amplitude variation of the high-frequency cyclic force associated with the segmented chip formation increased with increasing depth of cut and feed rate, and decreased with increasing cutting speed from 57 m/min except at the cutting speeds where harmonic vibration of the machine occurs...|$|E

High speed machining has received important interest because {{it leads to}} an increase of productivity and a better workpiece surface quality. At high cutting speeds, the tool wears increases dramatically due to the high temperature at the tool-workpiece interface. The cutting force depends upon the cutting speeds, depth of cuts and feed rates. The behavior {{can be attributed to}} the precipitation hardening in the alloy on account of the formation intermetallic compounds. The cutting force increases with increase in feed rate and depth of cut. The machining parameters with the highest influence on tool wear progress are cutting speed and feed/tooth. Tool wear impairs the surface finish and hence the tool life is reduced. The cutting speed range was up to 1800 m/min. The feed rate used was up to 5000 mm/min. Cutting speeds of up to 1800 m/min are feasible and will greatly improve the milling process productivity and to implement this range of cutting velocity in industrial applications, new cutter designs should be developed.

The material characteristics such as strain rate sensitivity, strain hardening and thermal softening are considered. In the primary shear zone, thermomechanical coupling and inertia effects are accounted for. Due {{to the fact that the}} reference frame associated to the primary shear zone moves with the tool rotation, an analysis of the inertial effects has been performed. As the heat conductivity of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V is low, the thermomechanical process of chip formation is supposed to be adiabatic; thus, the problem equations are reduced to a system of two non-linear equations which are solved numerically by combining the Newton-Raphson method and Gaussian quadrature. The present analytical approach leads to a three-dimensional cutting force model for end milling operations. Calculated and experimental results extracted from the literature are compared for several operations: full immersion, up-milling and down-milling and for different cutting conditions.
