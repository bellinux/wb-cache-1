This paper concerns the following questions: Which techniques of pneumatic pest control are available and how may these techniques be improved in terms of technical and physical parameters? Hypothesis: Analysis of pneumatic pest control techniques supports improvement of present available implements. Method: Literature review, process analysis, and evaluation in respect of agricultural engineering parameters (air flow rate, air speed, working hours, energy input, process costs). Results: Success of pneumatic pest control varies in a wide range, and the technique does not always grant satisfying results. Collection of eggs and larvae is more difficult than collection of adult insects. Usually weekly treatment is necessary. Frequent treatments may cause soil compaction. Pneumatic pest control may distribute fungal infection. Beneficial organisms may suffer from pneumatic techniques. Investment costs of pneumatic implements are high (ca. 5000 - 12000 €/row). Simultaneously blowing and sucking hoods work better than <b>common</b> <b>suction</b> hoods. Both the interrelationship and the control of physical parameters is almost not subject of research. An analysis of physical parameters and their interrelationships reveals that airflow rate, working width, and travel speed can be comprised within the term air requirement L=te*V where: te is the effective working time and V the airflow rate. The air requirement correlates with the success of the treatment and is an objective evaluation criterion for the implement and its pneumatic efficiency. The latter may be improved by the following measures: 1) High travel speed prevents pests from escaping the suction hood. 2) Pests sitting upon the plant should start to fly before suction. This may be achieved pneumatically by blowing nozzles and/or mechanically by chains, brushes or similar devices. 3) A suction hood stretched in direction of travel may prolong the duration of pneumatic treatment to ensure successful control. To minimize the tractor power required, the suction airflow velocity under the suction hood should be as low as possible. However, the suction airflow velocity must always be greater than the flying speed of the pest. Low airflow velocity may also contribute to go easy on useful insects.

40|$|The {{method of}} {{attachment}} of a prosthesis to the residual limb (suspension system) is a critical issue {{in the process of}} providing prosthesis to an amputee. Proper fit of the stump inside the socket and appropriate selection of prosthetic suspension positively affect the amputees’ gait, distribution of pressure within the socket, and amputees’ satisfaction. This research aimed to: (1) conduct a survey to compare the effects of seal-in liner and <b>common</b> <b>suction</b> socket (CSS) on transfemoral amputees’ satisfaction; (2) compare the effects of the Seal-In liner (suction) and Dermo liner (Pin/lock) on transtibial amputees’ gait performance; and (3) design and evaluate (mechanical testing, pressure mapping, gait evaluation, and satisfaction survey) a new prosthetic suspension system. The survey study showed that the overall satisfaction increased {{with the use of the}} Seal-In liner compared with the CSS (P 0. 05). Evaluation of kinetic data and subjects’ feedback showed that the participants were more confident to use the suction socket, and the sockets were more suitable for walking. However, the participants expressed more complaints with this system because of difficulty in donning and doffing. Factors influenced by the prosthetic suspension system were derived through an extensive systematic literature review, and a new suspension system (Holo) using Velcro or Hook and Loop concept was designed and fabricated. The universal testing machine was used to evaluate the mechanical properties of the designed suspension system. For validation, the Holo was compared with three other common suspension systems, namely, the pin/lock, seal-in, and magnetic suspension system. The maximum tensile load that the new system could iv bear (before failure) was 490 N (SD, 5. 5). However, the pin/lock system could tolerate loading of 580 N (SD, 8. 5). The magnetic (MPSS) and seal-in (suction) could tolerate loads of 350. 9 N (SD, 7. 0) and 310 N (SD, 8. 4), respectively. Comparison (interface pressure) between the pin/lock and the Holo system showed that high pressure was applied to the residual limb at the distal region of the stump by the pin/lock system during ambulation. The new coupling system could distribute the pressure more uniformly over the residual limb. PEQ results indicated that the participants were generally pleased with the new system, particularly with easy donning and doffing procedures. Gait evaluation (case study) demonstrated a slightly higher walking speed and stride length with the new socket with Velcro suspension system than with the pin/lock system. Kinetic results also revealed that the patient were more confident to walk with the Holo system. The Holo suspension system may be used as an alternative suspension system for lower-limb amputees because the biomechanical findings were consistent with the ranges in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Manifolded {{compressors}} {{are widely}} used in existing refrigeration systems such as cold rooms, display windows and ice machines. Scroll compressors are increasingly used in refrigeration systems, hence manifolded scroll compressors are easily found in the current market. The manifolding of two, three or even four compressors provides many benefits. It can provide capacity modulation; it can offer lower starting load of the system; it also enables the change of one compressor when it is tripped without shutting down the whole system. The key success factor of design of the manifold is to ensure the right balance of the oil between compressors in different running conditions. It is vital for the compressor to maintain the proper level and quantity of oil for its reliability. Two kinds of oil management solutions are predominant. One is the active solution which includes a mechanical or electronic oil level control device (oil level regulator) to control the oil feeding {{in order to maintain}} the oil level inside of the compressor crankcase. This solution is maturely used in the market. The other is the passive solution which relies on the piping design to achieve a good oil balance. The passive one is more interesting for its cost effectiveness and robustness due to fewer components, however, it is more difficult to handle. In this paper, three different passive oil management solutions for even tandem systems are studied. The first solution is that each compressor has its own respective oil separator; oil separated in the oil separator is returned back to the corresponding compressor crankcase, and the oil balance line is installed to avoid that one compressor oil level is much higher than the other if OS(oil separator) efficiency is different or any OS is blocked. The second solution consists of two compressors sharing one common oil separator; oil separated from the OS is fed back to the <b>common</b> <b>suction</b> line, and is then led back to each compressor with refrigerant gas. The oil return has to be split equally between the running compressors; the oil state could be as spray with the gas and as droplets along the length and bend of the piping. Since the oil is returning back together with the suction gas, gas balance is critical and gas velocity in the suction line is very important. Suction header and suction branch design is described in detail in the paper to ensure the gas balance and oil return. The oil balance line is installed between two compressors in order to balance the oil level. The third solution is that two compressors share one oil separator; oil is returned back to one compressor crankcase and then through the oil balance line to feed another compressor’s crankcase. All of the above three passive solutions are working but have their own advantages and disadvantages. Test results for each solution are shown in the paper. Also, the vibration analysis and the tests are described to optimize the piping design for good acoustic result...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the dynamic properties of compacted clayey soils subjected to low amplitude vibration. A fast and simple ultrasonic pulse transmission method was used. Tests were conducted on three clayey soils with low to high plasticity compacted using standard and modified Proctor effort over a range of water contents. The samples were allowed to dry after compaction and P-wave velocity, S-wave velocity, Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio, and shear modulus were determined. The effects of soil type, compaction conditions, and degree of saturation on the dynamic response of the soils were investigated. The elastic wave velocities and the dynamic shear modulus increased as the soil plasticity decreased. The velocities and the modulus increased and the Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio decreased as the degree of saturation decreased due to drying. Generally, the velocities and moduli increased significantly at the early stages of drying with the changes becoming more gradual as drying progressed. Variations were high for soils compacted with low energy and high water content. The shear moduli of the soils were also estimated using a <b>common</b> empirical equation. <b>Suction</b> values obtained for the test soils in a different study were used as effective stresses in the estimation.

40|$|The drag {{developed}} on an object {{as it moves}} through a fluid comprises {{of a number of}} components arising from various and differing fluid phenomena. For aerodynamic bodies such as aircraft, one of the most dominant components of the total drag force is that arising from shear interactions between the surface of the object and the fluid. In steady, cruise conditions this shear-induced skin friction drag can account for almost 50 % of the total drag force on the body and hence this is the reason much interest surrounds the minimisation of this component. Laminar Flow Control (LFC) is the field of aerodynamics focused on minimising skin friction, or viscous drag. The viscosity of a fluid, and the shear interactions between the layers of fluid and the aerodynamic body give rise to a boundary layer, a region of fluid with diminished fluid velocity and momentum. Laminar Flow Control aims to minimise the momentum deficit within the boundary layer by manipulating the flow within and encouraging favourable flow conditions to exist and be maintained. In essence, Laminar Flow Control attempts to maintain laminar flow within the boundary layer, improving the stability of the flow, delaying the onset of turbulence and the formation of a turbulent boundary layer that develops significantly more drag than an equivalent laminar structure. A number of techniques exist for controlling and maintaining laminar flow within a boundary layer. Examples include compliant surfaces, acoustic arrays and <b>suction,</b> and all <b>share</b> the common trait of complexity, which to date has limited the application of such systems in the real world. In the search for simpler Laminar Flow Control technology, attention has been turned towards Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) plasma actuators as a possible alternative. Through the formation of a small volume of plasma, these actuators are capable of producing an electrostatic body force that can couple with the surrounding air and bring about a jetting effect without the addition of mass. This jetting effect, if controlled effectively, can potentially favourably augment a boundary layer flow and lead to a delay in transition. The work discussed in this thesis represents a contribution to the field of DBD-based Laminar Flow Control. The aim was to further investigate the potential of plasma actuators for improving the hydrodynamic stability of a boundary layer and hence contribute to the limited published data pertaining to this field. The research involved the development of a DBD-based LFC system in which plasma actuators were used to augment the most fundamental of boundary layer flows, the flat plate, Blasius-type. By measuring the augmentation to the velocity profile of the boundary layer brought about by the LFC system, the stability of the flow was able to be investigated and hence the feasibility of the technology determined. The plasma actuators utilised in this research were designed such that control could be achieved over the shape of the induced jetting profile. To minimise adverse interactions with boundary layer flows, the plasma actuators were designed so that the magnitude and position of the maximal induced jetting velocity could be controlled. After consultation of the literature, novel actuators utilising orthogonally arranged electrodes were conceived and tested in a parametric study. Through variation of the distance to which the exposed electrode sat proud above the surface of the actuator, in addition to variation of the applied voltage, {{it was found that the}} desired control over the induced jet could be attained, leading to the identification of two mechanisms through which the DBD-based LFC system could be tuned. The details of the design and development of these orthogonal actuators and the effect of the electrode height on the jetting characteristics of the devices can be found in Gibson et al. (2009 a) and Gibson et al. (2009 b). After identifying suitable and novel actuator arrangements, a tuning strategy was conceived to hasten the development of the LFC system. Rather than implementing the actuators and measuring the response of the boundary layer to the plasma first, Linear Stability Theory was instead used to identify desirable boundary layer augmentation objectives for the LFC system. Linear Stability Analyses (LSAs) were performed on a number of idealised boundary layer flows, obtained from curve fitting analytical functions to published DBDaugmented boundary layer data, as well as from boundary layer theory. The LSAs were conducted using an Orr-Sommerfeld Equation solver developed as part of this research, which utilises a finite differencing scheme. The outcome of this comparison process was that the developed DBD-based LFC system was used to attempt to augment the boundary layer such that the flow attained an asymptotic suction velocity profile, which would give the boundary layer a limit of stability almost two orders of magnitude greater than that of the base flow, and hence significant robustness to transition. The conceived DBD-based LFC system was implemented into a Blasiusv type boundary layer which was formed over the Flat Plate Rig (FPR) designed and developed as part of this research. Initially a single actuator was utilised, positioned just upstream of the location of the critical Reynolds Number (limit of stability) of the flow. Due to the design of the FPR and the actuators utilised, it was possible to study the response of the layer to the plasma with and without a mild suction effect, introduced through a 5 mm wide slot that was required for operation of the actuator. This mild suction effect was measured to be approximately 4 Pa, and by itself was found to be insufficiently strong enough to augment the flow such that it attained the characteristics of a boundary layer with uniform wall suction. With the FPR, measurements of the velocity profile of the boundary layer with and without flow control were made around the critical Reynolds Number location of the flow (80000 < Rex < 120000), which allowed the changes to the stability of the flow to be studied. As discussed in Gibson et al. (2012) the initial results of the DBD-based LFC system showed that the plasma was adversely affecting the stability of the flow. Subsequent tuning of the system was therefore performed through variation of the applied voltage of the actuator. From this tuning it was found that an actuator operated with an applied voltage of 19. 0 kVpp (referred to as a low-voltage actuator) in conjunction with the mild suction effect, produced boundary layer characteristics akin to those of a flow exposed to uniform wall suction. In addition, an actuator operated with an applied voltage of 21. 4 kVpp (referred to as a high-voltage actuator) was found to adversely affect the stability, even more so in the absence of the mild suction effect. The single low-voltage actuator was found to be able to maintain uniform wall suction-like characteristics for 50 mm beyond the trailing edge of the encapsulated electrode. This finding pertaining to the use of the low-voltage actuator highlighted the potential of a single DBD device to develop uniform wall suction-like characteristics with only a mild suction effect through a single slot, and hence in a less complex fashion than conventional suction systems. An attempt was made to maintain the favourable benefits of the single, low-voltage actuator by using two such actuators placed in series. However, the effect of this combined double-actuator/suction system differed only slightly from the suction-only system (with two slots instead of one), meaning that in this configuration, the use of the plasma was somewhat superfluous. Hence it could be concluded from the results of the research that a single low-voltage actuator operated in conjunction with a mild suction effect is more effective as a LFC system than a single mild-suction slot, but a combined double-low-voltage actuator/suction system is no better than a simpler and less energy consuming double-mild-suction slot system. It is, however, anticipated that through the undertaking of future works, utilising additional actuators that have undergone further tuning, a LFC even more effective than the double suction slot system tested in this research will ultimately be developed.
