40|$|The <b>blanking</b> <b>plug,</b> Burton Part No 82530 - 12 - 5502 - 3212 - 0000 NR, which blocks off {{the charge}} lead on Autoub 6000 leaked water during two {{missions}} on the JC 027 cruise. An investigation showed fibres had become trapped inside the connector {{which would have}} caused a leak. Measurement of the plug <b>and</b> <b>connector</b> shows the secondary seal around the pins and sockets to be marginal. Care to avoid debris being trapped and better tools to aid tightening the connector will avoid {{a repeat of the}} problem...|$|R
50|$|The DT200R shares similar engine {{cases with}} the ATV BLASTER - But the Blaster is not crank case {{induction}} like the DT200R. Both DT200R & Blaster crank shafts are compatible, the DT200R piston doesn't have port's like the Blaster, but the Blaster piston {{can be used}} with the DT200R. In the Blaster version & some of the DT200WR versions the oil pump is not installed, <b>blanking</b> <b>plug</b> is fitted over the oil pump drive.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} {{breakout}} boxes use D-subminiature connectors (sometimes {{referred to as}} D-sub <b>connectors</b> <b>and</b> sometimes erroneously as DB <b>connectors)</b> <b>and</b> are configured with {{both male and female}} DE-9, DA-15, DB-25, DC-37 or DD-50 standard density <b>connectors</b> <b>and</b> related test points. These units {{can also be used to}} simulate special cables, interconnect RS-232 devices, or adapt test equipment to an RS-232 device.|$|R
50|$|Single-mode fiber is {{generally}} yellow, {{with a blue}} <b>connector,</b> <b>and</b> a longer transmission distance. Multi-mode fiber {{is generally}} orange or grey, with a cream or black <b>connector,</b> <b>and</b> a shorter transmission distance.|$|R

50|$|Eventually, {{the limited}} {{frequency}} {{range of a}} 14 mm <b>connector</b> <b>and</b> its high manufacturing cost overcame its ease of assembly and the GR-874 was supplanted generally by the 7 mm type N <b>connector</b> <b>and</b> its variants, the BNC <b>connector</b> <b>and</b> the TNC <b>connector,</b> <b>and</b> the later higher frequency 3.5 mm SMA connectors. General Radio, then still {{a major source of}} RF test equipment, designed the incompatible GR-900 as a 14 mm successor to the GR-874, filling the industry's need for a higher performance sexless connector for fully reversible lab standards and related test equipment. The GR-900 was in turn succeeded in this essential niche role by the completely sexless APC-7 connector.|$|R

40|$|Existing work on {{software}} connectors shows significant disagreement on both their definition and {{their relationships with}} components, coordinators and adaptors. We propose a precise characterisation of connectors, discuss how {{they relate to the}} other three classes, and contradict the suggestion that <b>connectors</b> <b>and</b> components are disjoint. We discuss the relationship between <b>connectors</b> <b>and</b> coupling, and argue the inseparability of connection models from component programming models. Finally we identify the class of configuration languages, show how it relates to primitive <b>connectors</b> <b>and</b> outline relevant areas for future work. 1...|$|R
