40|$|Strains {{carrying}} {{mutations in}} the prfB gene encoding peptide chain release factor 2 of Escherichia coli were isolated. prfB 1, prfB 2, and prfB 3 were selected as suppressor mutations of a lacZ (UGA) mutation at 37 degrees C, one of which, prfB 2, is temperature sensitive in growth. A prfB 286 strain {{was selected as}} a <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutant</b> which grows at 32 but not at 43 degrees C and was shown to have UGA-suppressor activity. All the mutations are recessive UGA-suppressors. These data indicate that release factor 2 is essential to E. coli growth and that all mutants isolated here trigger suppression of the UGA codon...|$|E
40|$|Phage φ 29 suppressor-sensitive (sus) mutants of 14 cistrons {{have been}} {{examined}} for production of 14 C-labeled viral-specific proteins in restrictive infections of Bacillus subtilis. Proteins specified by four cistrons (H, J, L, and N) have been resolved and identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, and fragments of the normal polypeptides were detected. Mutants of six cistrons (C, D, E, F, I, and M) demonstrated two or more missing bands in the gel profiles, and thus some of these gene products may have regulatory functions. Mutation was detected in at least five genes coding for low-molecular-weight proteins, but a <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutant</b> in {{only one of these}} genes has been isolated. Preliminary evidence that a precursor protein is cleaved to generate the neck appendage structural protein and a low-molecular-weight product has been obtained...|$|E
40|$|The human malaria {{parasite}} Plasmodium falciparum {{relies on}} the acquisition of host purines for its survival within human erythrocytes. Purine salvage by the parasite requires specialized transporters at the parasite plasma membrane (PPM), but the exact mechanism of purine entry into the infected erythrocyte, and the primary purine source used by the parasite, remain unknown. Here, we report that transgenic parasites lacking the PPM transporter PfNT 1 (P. falciparum nucleoside transporter 1) are auxotrophic for hypoxanthine, inosine, and adenosine under physiological conditions and are viable only if these normally essential nutrients are provided at excess concentrations. Transport measurements across the PPM revealed a severe reduction in hypoxanthine uptake in the knockout, whereas adenosine and inosine transport were only partially affected. These data provide compelling evidence for a sequential pathway for exogenous purine conversion into hypoxanthine using host enzymes followed by PfNT 1 -mediated transport into the parasite. The phenotype of the <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutant</b> establishes PfNT 1 as {{a critical component of}} purine salvage in P. falciparum and validates PfNT 1 as a potential therapeutic target...|$|E
40|$|Snu 114 p is a yeast U 5 snRNP protein {{homologous}} to the ribosomal {{elongation factor}} EF- 2. Snu 114 p exhibits the same domain structure as EF- 2, including the G-domain, {{but with an}} additional N-terminal domain. To test whether Snu 114 p in the spliceosome is involved in rearranging RNA secondary structures (by analogy to EF- 2 in the ribosome), we created <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutants.</b> Deletion of this N-terminal domain (snu 114 DeltaN) leads to a temperature-sensitive phenotype at 37 degreesC and a pre-mRNA splicing defect in vivo. Heat treatment of snu 114 DeltaN extracts blocked splicing in vitro before the first step. The snu 114 DeltaN still associates with the tri-snRNP, and the stability of this particle is not significantly impaired by thermal inactivation. Heat treatment of snu 114 DeltaN extracts resulted in accumulation of arrested spliceosomes in which the U 4 RNA was not efficiently released, and we show that U 4 is still base paired with the U 6 RNA. This suggests that Snu 114 p is involved, directly or indirectly, in the U 4 /U 6 unwinding, an essential step towards spliceosome activation...|$|R
40|$|After {{localised}} mutagenesis of the 76 min {{region of}} the Escherichia coli chromosome, we isolated a number of <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutants.</b> Some of these mutants had a filamentation temperature sensitive (fts) phenotype and {{were assigned to the}} cell division genes ftsE of ftsX, whereas others were defective in the heat shock regulator gene rpoH. Both missense and amber mutant alleles of these genes were produced. The missense mutant ftsE alleles were cloned and sequenced {{to determine whether or not}} the respective mutations mapped to the {{region of the}} gene encoding the putative nucleotide binding site. Surprisingly, most of these mutant FtsE proteins had missense substitutions in a different domain of the protein. This region of the FtsE protein is highly conserved in a large family of proteins involved in diverse transport processes in all living cells, from bacteria to man. One of the proteins in this large family of homologues is the human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and the FtsE substitutions were found to be in very closely linked, or identical, amino acid residues to those which are frequently altered in the CFTR of human patients. These results confirm the structural importance of this highly conserved region of FtsE and CFTR and add weight to the current structural model for the human protein...|$|R
40|$|Export of {{the outer}} {{membrane}} lipoprotein in Escherichia coli was examined in <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutants</b> that were defective in protein export in general, including secA, secB, secC, and secD. Lipoprotein export was affected in a secA(Ts) mutant of E. coli at the nonpermissive temperature; it was also affected in a secA(Am) mutant of E. coli at the permissive temperature, {{but not at the}} nonpermissive temperature. The export of lipoprotein occurred normally in E. coli carrying a null secB::Tn 5 mutation; on the other hand, the export of an OmpF::Lpp hybrid protein, consisting of the signal sequence plus 11 amino acid residues of mature OmpF and mature lipoprotein, was affected by the secB mutation. The synthesis of lipoprotein was reduced in the secC mutant at the nonpermissive temperature, as was the case for synthesis of the maltose-binding protein, while the synthesis of OmpA was not affected. Lipoprotein export was found to be slightly affected in secD(Cs) mutants at the nonpermissive temperature. These results taken together indicate that the export of lipoprotein shares the common requirements for functional SecA and SecD proteins with other exported proteins, but does not require a functional SecB protein. SecC protein (ribosomal protein S 15) is required for the optimal synthesis of lipoprotein...|$|R
40|$|The sec/prl gene {{products}} catalyze the translocation of precursor proteins {{from the}} cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. Recessive, <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutant</b> alleles of these genes (sec mutations) cause a generalized defect in protein secretion; dominant suppressor mutant alleles (prl mutations) restore export of precursor proteins with altered signal sequences. In prl strains, a precursor protein with a defective signal sequence can be selectively targeted to the suppressor gene product. When a precursor LacZ hybrid protein is used, the targeted prl protein is inactivated by the large, toxic hybrid molecule, a result termed suppressor-directed inactivation (SDI). Using SDI, two different secretion-related complexes can be generated: a pretranslocation complex {{that contains a}} hybrid protein with an unprocessed signal sequence, and a translocation complex in which the hybrid protein is jammed in transmembrane orientation with the signal sequence cleaved. Additional Sec proteins that are contained within, and thus sequestered by, each of these complexes can be identified when their functional levels are lowered using the conditional lethal sec mutations. Results of this genetic analysis suggest a multistep pathway for protein secretion in which the translocation machinery assembles on demand...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} codon {{insertion}} mutants was isolated following restriction site-directed linker insertion mutagenesis {{of the open}} reading frame for the type 5 adenovirus terminal protein precursor. The <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutant</b> H 5 sub 100 bears an insertion mutation upstream of the first AUG in the reading frame, fails to replicate its DNA under nonpermissive conditions, and {{was assigned to the}} terminal protein complementation group. These data establish that terminal protein is an essential polypeptide required for DNA replication in vivo and indicate that the NH 2 -terminal region of the precursor is encoded in an upstream mRNA leader. The extended eclipse period of the viral replication cycle in H 5 in 179 -infected cells is probably a consequence of delayed onset of DNA replication. Analysis of DNA replication in coinfections with wild-type virus shows that the in 179 mutation has cis and trans effects. The trans-dominant, negative-complementing in 179 terminal protein precursor inhibits wild-type DNA replication in a dose-dependent manner. Replication of parental in 179 templates is not stimulated by an excess of coinfecting wild-type virus, indicating that the mutant terminal protein covalently bound to the in 179 template in some way interferes with the replication of that template. The implications of these results for the structure and function of the terminal protein are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Thermus thermophilus is an {{extremely}} thermophilic bacterium that is widely used as a model thermophile, in large part due to its amenability to genetic manipulation. Here we describe a system for the introduction of genomic point mutations or deletions using a counterselectable marker consisting of a <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutant</b> allele of pheS encoding the phenylalanyl-tRNA syn-thetase-subunit. Mutant PheS with an A 294 G amino acid substitution renders cells sensitive to the phenylalanine analog p-chlorophenylalanine. Insertion of the mutant pheS allele via a linked kanamycin resistance gene into a chromosomal locus pro-vides a gene replacement intermediate that can be removed by homologous recombination using p-chlorophenylalanine as a counterselective agent. This selection is suitable for the sequential introduction of multiple mutations to produce a final strain unmarked by an antibiotic resistance gene. We demonstrated the utility of this method by constructing strains bearing either a point mutation in or a precise deletion of the rrsB gene encoding 16 S rRNA. We also used this selection to identify spontaneous, large-scale deletions in the pTT 27 megaplasmid, apparently mediated by either of the T. thermophilus insertion elements ISTth 7 and ISTth 8. One such deletion removed 121 kb, including 118 genes, or over half of pTT 27, including multiple sugar hydrolase genes, and facilitated {{the development of a}} plasmid-encoded reporter system based on -galactosidase. The ability to introduce mutations ranging from single base substitutions to large-scale deletions provides a potentially powerful tool for engineering the genome of T. thermophilus and possibly other thermophiles as well...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using "clustered charge-to-alanine" mutagenesis (replacement by alanine {{of two or}} more charged residues clustered in a five- or six-amino acid sequence) to create temperature-sensitive, <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> mutations in vaccinia virus was examined by creating nine mutations in the vaccinia virus gene G 2 R. G 2 R was chosen for this analysis because mutations in this gene confer selectable phenotypes. Specifically, vaccinia viruses that contain a wild-type copy of G 2 R nare sensitive the effects of the anti-poxvirus drug isatin-beta-thiosemicarbazone (IBT), while mutations in G 2 R that completely abolish the function of the G 2 R protein product confer dependence upon IBT for growth. A previously isolated mutant carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation that maps to G 2 R (Cts 56) is resistant to IBT at the permissive temperature and dependent upon IBT at the restrictive temperature. Nine clustered charge-to-alanine mutants were examined. Four of the these mutants (AS 1, AS 4, AS 6, and AS 9) display some degree of temperature sensitivity in the function of the G 2 R gene product. AS 1 is temperature sensitive for growth in both a plaque assay and in a one-step growth experiment. AS 6 and AS 9 form small plaques at the nonpermissive temperature and are temperature sensitive for growth in a one-step growth experiment. AS 4 manifests its temperature sensitivity as temperature-dependent IBT resistance. Five of the mutations (AS 2, AS 3, AS 5, AS 7, and AS 8) appeared to confer phenotypes indistinguishable from that of wild-type vaccinia. These results demonstrate that temperature-sensitive <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutants</b> can be created in vaccinia virus by altering the charge characteristics of essential viral proteins...|$|R
40|$|Overproduction of rRNA was artificially induced in Escherichia coli {{cells to}} test whether the {{synthesis}} of ribosomal protein (r-protein) is normally repressed by feedback regulation. When rRNA was overproduced more than twofold from a hybrid plasmid carrying the rrnB operon fused to the lambda pL promoter (pL-rrnB), synthesis of individual r-proteins increased {{by an average of}} about 60 %. This demonstrates that the synthesis of r-proteins is repressed under normal conditions. The increase of r-protein production, however, for unknown reasons, was not as great as the increase in rRNA synthesis and resulted in an imbalance between the amounts of rRNA and r-protein synthesis. Therefore, only a small (less than 20 %) increase in the synthesis of complete 30 S and 50 S ribosome subunits was detected, and a considerable fraction of the excess rRNA was degraded. Lack of complete cooperativity in the assembly of ribosome subunits in vivo is discussed as a possible explanation for the absence of a large stimulation of ribosome synthesis observed under these conditions. In addition to the induction of intact rRNA overproduction from the pL-rrnB operon, the effects of unbalanced overproduction of each of the two large rRNAs, 16 S rRNA and 23 S rRNA, on r-protein synthesis were examined using pL-rrnB derivatives carrying a large deletion in either the 23 S rRNA gene or the 16 S rRNA gene. Operon-specific derepression after 23 S or 16 S rRNA overproduction correlated with the overproduction of rRNA containing the target site for the operon-specific repressor r-protein. These results are discussed to explain the apparent coupling of the assembly of one ribosomal subunit with that of the other which was observed in earlier studies on <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutants</b> with defects in ribosome assembly...|$|R
40|$|Characterization of <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutants</b> of alphaviruses, Sindbis {{virus and}} Semliki Forest virus, has {{indicated}} that in almost all the RNA-negative mutants the temperature-sensitive (ts) defect prevents the formation of active transcription complexes at nonpermissive temperature (40 degrees C), but such complexes retain activity at 40 degrees C if formed first at permissive temperature (30 degrees C). Our recent results have extended the characterization of one exception to this finding: Sindbis ts 6 transcription complexes, once formed at 30 degrees C, do not function at 40 degrees C. We used an in vitro assay for viral RNA synthesis {{to determine whether the}} ts defect was the result of dissociation of the complex or of a failure to elongate RNA chains in a stable complex. Our results indicated that the phenotype of ts 6 observed in vivo was retained in vitro. In vivo incorporation into single-stranded 49 S and 26 S RNA was inhibited simultaneously with its incorporation into replicative intermediates upon shifting ts 6 -infected cells to 40 degrees C, which was compatible with a defect in elongation. Complexes formed at 30 degrees C and inactivated in vivo by shifting to 40 degrees C were reactivated by incubation in vitro at 30 degrees C but not at 40 degrees C. Thus, the transcription complexes were stable. Nascent RNA chains initiated in vivo and pulse-labeled in vitro were chased into single-stranded 49 S and 26 S RNA only when incubation was at 30 degrees C, indicating that the ts 6 transcription complex was temperature sensitive in elongation. It should be possible to study in vitro other alphavirus RNA-negative mutants that demonstrate a change in viral RNA synthesis after shift to 40 degrees C. These would include ts mutants in the synthesis of subgenomic 26 S mRNA and of minus-strand RNA...|$|R
40|$|A <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutant</b> of Escherichia coli lacking {{phosphatidylglycerol}} in vivo at 42 degrees C {{has been}} previously isolated by two-stage mutagenesis (M. Nishijima and C. R. H. Raetz, J. Biol. Chem. 254 : 7837 - 7844, 1979). In the first step (designated pgsA 444) the phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthetase is partially inactivated, but the resulting strain continues to make {{about two-thirds of the}} normal level of phosphatidylglycerol and is not temperature sensitive. The second lesion, termed pgsB 1, causes temperature-sensitive growth and phosphatidylglycerol synthesis in strains harboring pgsA 444. The pgsA locus appears to be the structural gene for the synthetase and maps near min 42. In the present study we mapped the pgsB 1 mutation and characterized its interaction with pgsA 444 by genetic and biochemical methods. Unexpectedly, pgsB 1 was not a second lesion in the pgsA structural gene, but rather mapped at a distinct site near minute 4. P 1 vir-mediated contransduction suggested the gene order pantonA-dapD-pgsB-dnaE (clockwise). Independent evidence for the genetic mapping was provided by the identification of two hybrid ColE 1 plasmids (pLC 26 - 43 and pLC 34 - 20. L. Clarke and J. Carbon, Cell 9 : 91 - 99, 1976) which both carry pgsB+ and dnaE+. Introduction of either the pgsA+ or the pgsB+ gene (via episomes, hybrid plasmids or P 1 vir transduction) suppressed the temperature sensitivity of the double mutant (pgsA 444 pgsB 1) and restored normal levels of phosphatidylglycerol at 42 degrees C. In addition, strains with the pgsA+ pgsB 1 genotype produced a novel lipid (X) at all temperatures, whereas the double mutant (pgsA 444 pgsB 1) contained two unusual lipids (X and Y) after 3 h at 42 degrees C. Both X and Y are precursors of lipopolysaccharide, and introduction of pgsB+ into the double mutant caused the disappearance of X and Y. Although the biochemical basis of the pgsB 1 lesion is unknown, its existence suggests a previously unrecognized link between lipopolysaccharide and phosphatidylglycerol syntheses in E. coli...|$|E
40|$|Conjugation and {{bacteriophage}} P 1 transduction {{experiments in}} Escherichia coli showed that {{resistance to the}} antibacterial compound diazaborine is caused by an allelic form of the envM gene. The envM gene from Salmonella typhimurium was cloned and sequenced. It codes for a 27, 765 -dalton protein. The plasmids carrying this DNA complemented a <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> envM <b>mutant</b> of E. coli. Recombinant plasmids containing gene envM from a diazaborine-resistant S. typhimurium strain conferred the drug resistance phenotype to susceptible E. coli cells. A guanine-to-adenine exchange in the envM gene changing a Gly codon to a Ser codon was shown {{to be responsible for}} the resistance character. Upstream of envM a small gene coding for a 10, 445 -dalton protein was identified. Incubating a temperature-sensitive E. coli envM mutant at the nonpermissive temperature caused effects on the cells similar to those caused by treatment with diazaborine, i. e., inhibition of fatty acid, phospholipid, and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, induction of a 28, 000 -dalton inner membrane protein, and change in the ratio of the porins OmpC and OmpF...|$|R
40|$|The {{regulation}} of vesicular transport in eukaryotic cells involves Ras-like GTPases of the Ypt/Rab family. Studies in yeast and mammalian cells indicate that individual family members act in vesicle docking/fusion to specific target membranes. Using the two-hybrid system, {{we have now}} identified a 248 amino acid, integral membrane protein, termed Yip 1, that specifically binds to the transport GTPases Ypt 1 p and Ypt 31 p. Evidence for physical interaction of these GTPases with Yip 1 p was also demonstrated by affinity chromatography and/or co-immunoprecipitation. Like the two GTPases, Yip 1 p is essential for yeast cell viability and, according to subcellular fractionation and indirect immunofluorescence, is located to Golgi membranes at steady state. Mutant cells depleted of Yip 1 p and <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> yip 1 <b>mutants</b> at the non-permissive temperature massively accumulate endoplasmic reticulum membranes and display aberrations in protein secretion and glycosylation of secreted invertase. The results suggests for a role for Yip 1 p in recruiting the two GTPases to Golgi target membranes in preparation for fusion...|$|R
40|$|Although {{chloral hydrate}} {{has been used}} as an {{anesthetic}} since 1872, its effect on cell structures and its mechanism of action are not clearly known. Early investigators (Nemec, 1904; van Regemorter, 1916; Strasburger, 1907; Sakamura, 1916) have shown that chloral hydrate produces uncoordinated chromosome movements and c-mitosis i. e. colchicine mitosis (Levan, 1938). Ris (1949) reported that chloral hydrate causes the disappearance of the mitotic spindle in grasshopper spermatocytes. Using eggs of Pleurodeles waltlii, Sentein (I 974) demonstrated that chloral hydrate alters the ultrastructure of chromosomes and arrests mitosis by destroying spindle fibres. Mole-Bajer (1969) found that immediately after chloral hydrate treatment in Haemanthus katherinae, the kinetochore and continuous microtubules were absent, but microtubules soon began to re-form anew. Since most of these studies were not quantitative, the chloral hydrate effect has mainly been described qualitatively. The simple eukaryote Aspergillus nidulans has certain advantages for the study of mitosis, the most important of which is that the genetics of the organism are well known. The cytology of mitosis in A. nidulans {{is similar to that of}} the higher eukaryotes in most respects (Robinow & Caten, 1969). During mitosis, the chromosomes condense, a mitotic spindle is formed, the chromosomes undergo anaphase separation, the spindle then disappears, the chromosomes relax and two daughter nuclei are formed (Robinow & Caten, 1969). As with many other fungi, the nuclear membrane remains intact during all phases of mitosis. A set of tempera-ture-sensitive, <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal,</b> mitotic <b>mutants</b> of A. nidulans has been isolated (Morris, unpublished observations). One of these mutants {{has been used as}} a tool to analyse quan-titatively the effect of chloral hydrate on mitosis...|$|R
40|$|Mutants that adsorb certain colicins {{without being}} killed, i. e., {{tolerant}} mutants (tol), were isolated from Escherichia coli K- 12 strains. Selection was done either with colicin K or E 2. Several groups of mutants showing different phenotypes were found, {{and some of}} them showed tolerance to both K and E colicins, which have different receptors. Many of these mutants mapped near gal. Typical mutants from group II, III, and IV were studied in more detail. The mutant loci were contransducible with gal by phage P 1. The linkage order was deduced to be tol-gal-λ. In partially diploid strains, these mutant loci are recessive to wild-type alleles. Temperature-dependent conditionally tolerant mutants were also isolated. Two groups were found: the first was tolerant to E 2 and E 3 at 40 C, but sensitive at 30 C; the second was tolerant to E 2 at 30 C, but sensitive at 40 C. Experiments done with these mutants suggest that these mutations affect the heat lability of some protein that is necessary for the response of cells to colicins. <b>Conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> tolerant <b>mutants</b> were isolated which at 40 C were tolerant to E 2 and E 3 and could not grow, but which at 30 C were fully sensitive and grew normally. The mutation mapped near malA. The tolerance at 40 C is not due to a consequence of an inactivation of general cellular metabolism, but presumably is a cause of the subsequent inhibition of cellular growth. The results suggest that some protein components involved in the response to colicin are also vital to normal cellular growth...|$|R
40|$|The {{essential}} Caenorhabditis elegans gene rfl- 1 encodes one subunit of a heterodimeric E 1 -activating enzyme in the Nedd 8 ubiquitin-like protein conjugation pathway. This pathway modifies the Cullin scaffolds of E 3 ubiquitin ligases with {{a single}} Nedd 8 moiety to promote ligase function. To identify genes that influence neddylation, we used a synthetic screen to identify genes that, when depleted with RNAi, enhance or suppress the embryonic lethality caused by or 198 ts, a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutation in rfl- 1. We identified reproducible suppressor and enhancer genes and employed a systematic specificity analysis for each modifier using four unrelated ts embryonic <b>lethal</b> <b>mutants.</b> Results of this analysis highlight the importance of specificity controls in identifying genetic interactions relevant to a particular biological process because 8 / 14 enhancers and 7 / 21 suppressors modified lethality in other mutants. Depletion of the strongest specific suppressors rescued the early embryonic cell division defects in rfl- 1 (or 198 ts) mutants. RNAi knockdown of some specific suppressors partially restored Cullin neddylation in rfl- 1 (or 198 ts) mutants, consistent with their gene products normally opposing neddylation, and GFP fusions to several suppressors were detected in the cytoplasm or the nucleus, similar in pattern to Nedd 8 conjugation pathway components in early embryonic cells. In contrast, depletion of the two strongest specific enhancers {{did not affect the}} early embryonic cell division defects observed in rfl- 1 (or 198 ts) mutants, suggesting that they may act at later times in other essential processes. Many of the specific modifiers are conserved in other organisms, and most are nonessential. Thus, when controlled properly for specificity, modifier screens using <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> C. elegans <b>mutants</b> can identify roles for nonessential but conserved genes in essential processes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe most {{prominent}} role of peroxisomes in photosynthetic plant tissues is {{their participation in}} photorespiration, a process {{also known as the}} oxidative C 2 cycle or the oxidative photosynthetic carbon cycle. Photorespiration is an essential process in land plants, as evident from the <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> phenotype of <b>mutants</b> deficient in enzymes or transport proteins involved in this pathway. The oxidative C 2 cycle is a salvage pathway for phosphoglycolate, the product of the oxygenase activity of ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO), to the Calvin cycle intermediate phosphoglycerate. The pathway is highly compartmentalized and involves reactions in chloroplasts, peroxisomes, and mitochondria. The H 2 O 2 -producing enzyme glycolate oxidase, catalase, and several aminotransferases of the photorespiratory cycle are located in peroxisomes, with catalase representing the major constituent of the peroxisomal matrix in photosynthetic tissues. Although photorespiration is of major importance for photosynthesis, the identification of the enzymes involved in this process has only recently been completed. Only {{little is known about the}} metabolite transporters for the exchange of photorespiratory intermediates between peroxisomes and the other organelles involved, and about the regulation of the photorespiratory pathway.

Galloway and C. R. H. Raetz, J. Biol. Chem. 265 : 6394 - 6402, 1990), was found to be, at conditions which promote normal growth, remarkably susceptible {{to a number of}} antibiotics. The MICs of hydrophobic antibiotics, such as rifampin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and fusidic acid, were 32 - to greater than 128 -fold lower for the lpxA 2 strain than for the parent type strain, and those of the peptide antibiotics vancomycin and bacitracin were 32 - and 256 -fold lower, respectively. Futhermore, the lpxA 2 strain was found to be sensitive to hypoosmotic conditions. Comparisons with the other characterized outer membrane permeability mutants, such as the heptose-deficient strains of E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium, the acrA and abs mutants of E. coli, and the ssc- 1 and class SS-B mutants of S. typhimurium, indicated that the lpxA 2 mutant had characteristically the most antibiotic-supersusceptible phenotype.

When H 5 ts 125 -infected cells were labeled with [35 S]methionine at 32 degrees C and then incubated without isotope at 39. 5 degrees C, the mutant's nonpermissive temperature, the 72, 000 molecular weight polypeptide was progressively degraded. Immunofluorescence examination of cells infected with wild-type virus, H 5 ts 125, and H 5 ts 149 (a second, unique DNA-minus mutant) showed that immunologically reactive DNA-binding protein was barely detectable in H 5 ts 125 -infected cells at 39. 5 degrees C, whereas this protein was present in wild-type- and H 5 TS 149 -infected cells, that the protein made at 32 degrees C in H 5 ts 125 -infected cells lost its ability to bind specific DNA-binding protein antibody when the infected cells were shifted to 39. 5 degrees C, and that if H 5 ts 125 -infected cells were shifted from the restrictive temperature to 32 degrees C, even {{in the presence of}} cycloheximide to stop protein synthesis, immunologically reactive DNA-binding protein reappeared...|$|R
40|$|Mutations {{within the}} {{polyamine}} biosynthetic pathway of Leishmania donovani, the etiological agent of visceral leishmaniasis, confer polyamine auxotrophy to the insect vector or promastigote {{form of the}} parasite. However, whether the infectious or amastigote form of the parasite requires an intact polyamine pathway has remained an open question. To address this issue, <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> Δodc <b>mutants</b> lacking ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis, were created by double targeted gene replacement within a virulent strain of L. donovani. ODC-deficient promastigotes and axenic amastigotes were auxotrophic for polyamines and capable of robust growth only when exogenous putrescine was supplied in the culture medium, confirming that polyamine biosynthesis is an essential nutritional pathway for L. donovani promastigotes. To assess whether the Δodc lesion also affected the ability of amastigotes to sustain a robust infection, macrophage and mouse infectivity experiments were performed. Parasite loads in murine macrophages infected with each of two independent Δodc knockout lines were decreased ∼ 80 % compared to their wild-type counterpart. Furthermore, α-difluoromethylornithine, a suicide inhibitor of ODC, inhibited growth of wild-type L. donovani amastigotes and effectively cured macrophages of parasites, thereby preventing host cell destruction. Strikingly, however, parasitemias of both Δodc null mutants were reduced by 6 and 3 orders of magnitude, respectively, in livers and spleens of BALB/c mice. The compromised infectivity phenotypes of the Δodc knockouts in both macrophages and mice were rescued by episomal complementation of the genetic lesion. These genetic and pharmacological studies strongly implicate ODC as an essential cellular determinant that {{is necessary for the}} viability and growth of both L. donovani promastigotes and amastigotes and intimate that pharmacological inhibition of ODC is a promising therapeutic paradigm for the treatment of visceral and perhaps other forms of leishmaniasis...|$|R
40|$|Intranasal {{inoculation}} of type 5 adenovirus {{into the}} cotton rat Sigmodon hispidus produces a pneumonia pathologically {{similar to that}} in humans, and it, therefore, provides an excellent animal model to investigate the pathogenesis of this disease. The goal {{of this study was to}} test the hypothesis that accumulation of viral structural proteins is responsible for a major portion of the cell-damage-producing disease. Since viral DNA replication is essential for synthesis of the viral structural proteins, which are products of late genes, the hypothesis was tested using mutants defective in genes required for DNA synthesis. Most experiments were done with the <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> temperature-sensitive (ts) <b>mutant</b> H 5 ts 125, which contains a mutation in the early region 2 A (E 2 A) gene encoding the DNA-binding protein. The data show that infection with 1 x 10 (9. 0) plaque-forming units of H 5 ts 125 induced a pneumonia that was as extensive and qualitatively the same as that after wild-type adenovirus type 5 infection, although H 5 ts 125 did not replicate to produce infectious virus. When cotton rats were infected with 1 x 10 (8. 0) plaque-forming units of wild-type adenovirus type 5 or H 5 ts 125, the pneumonias that followed were pathologically similar; in the latter phases, however, wild-type virus produced slightly more extensive pneumonia than did H 5 ts 125, probably because its replication permitted infection of more susceptible cells...|$|R

We report the first documented fabG mutants and their characterization. By chemical mutagenesis followed by a tritium suicide procedure, we obtained three <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> temperature-sensitive fabG <b>mutants.</b> The Escherichia coli [fabG (Ts) ] mutant contains two point mutations: A 154 T and E 233 K. The β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase activity of this mutant was extremely thermolabile, {{and the rate of}} fatty acid synthesis measured in vivo was inhibited upon shift to the nonpermissive temperature. Moreover, synthesis of the acyl-ACP intermediates of the pathway was inhibited upon shift of mutant cultures to the nonpermissive temperature, indicating blockage of the synthetic cycle. Similar results were observed for in vitro fatty acid synthesis. Complementation analysis revealed that only the E 233 K mutation was required to give the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype. In the two Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium fabG(Ts) mutants one strain had a single point mutation, S 224 F, whereas the second strain contained two mutations (M 125 I and A 223 T). All of the altered residues of the FabG mutant proteins are located on or near the twofold axes of symmetry at the dimer interfaces in this homotetrameric protein, suggesting that the quaternary structures of the mutant FabG proteins may be disrupted at the nonpermissive temperature...|$|R
40|$|Sequential {{degradation}} of cell cycle proteins {{is a major}} regulatory mechanism for proper cell proliferation. Turnover of these proteins is performed by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway, which poly-ubiquitylates and subsequently degrades the target proteins. The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a multi subunit E 3 ubiquitin ligase that provides substrate specificity and regulation of the ubiquitin pathway. Two {{of the most important}} substrates are Cut 2 /securin and Cdc 13 /cyclin B, enabling chromosome segregation and exit from mitosis, respectively. Since APC/C function is very important for the cell cycle progression, its activity is strictly regulated. The aim {{of this study is to}} understand the regulation of APC/C and how its subunits contribute to this regulation. For this purpose, we have focused on the two least understood subunits: Apc 1 /Cut 4 and Apc 5. <b>Conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> temperature sensitive <b>mutants</b> of these two subunits were created in fission yeast and the used for suppressor screening. We identified atf 1 + as a multicopy suppressor of apc 5 - 1, a mutation causing mitotic arrest. Fission yeast Atf 1, which is homologous to human ATF 2 /CRE-BP 1, is a bZIP domain mutant of Atf 1, which has lost its transcription activation function, was still able to suppress the ts phenotype of apc 5 - 1. The atf 1 +-dependent rescue was specific to the apc 5 - 1 allele, rather than rescuing other APC/C subunit mutants and deletion of atf 1 + increased the mitotic defects of the mutant. Interestingly, Atf 1 physically binds to the APC/C in vivo. Furthermore, in vitro studies proved that Atf 1 stimulates ubiquitylation activity of the APC/C. Finally; this interaction was shown to contribute to conjugation/mating efficiency of S. pombe cells upon nitrogen starvation and G 1 arrest. Altogether, these results reveal a novel role for Atf 1 in regulating the APC/C ubiquitin ligase, besides its transcription factor activity.

40|$|The DNA {{sequence}} of the secA gene, essential for protein export in Escherichia coli, was determined and found to encode a hydrophilic protein of 901 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 101, 902, consistent with its previously determined size and subcellular location. Sequence analysis of 9 secA(Ts) mutations conferring general protein export and secA regulatory defects revealed that these mutations were clustered in three specific regions within the first 170 amino acid residues of the SecA protein and {{were the result of}} single amino acid changes predicted to be severely disruptive of protein structure and function. The DNA sequence immediately upstream of secA was shown to encode a previously inferred gene, gene X. Sequence analysis of a <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> amber mutation, am 109, previously inferred to be located proximally in the secA gene, revealed that it was located distally in gene X and was <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> due to its polar effect on secA expression.

40|$|We {{have created}} 41 {{clustered}} charged-to-alanine scanning mutations of the mipA, γ-tubulin, gene of Aspergillus nidulans and have created strains carrying these mutations by two-step gene replacement {{and by a}} new procedure, heterokaryon gene replacement. Most mutant alleles confer a wild-type phenotype, but others are <b>lethal</b> or <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal.</b> The <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> alleles exhibit a variety of phenotypes under restrictive conditions. Most have robust but highly abnormal mitotic spindles and some have abnormal cytoplasmic microtubule arrays. Two alleles appear to have reduced amounts of γ-tubulin at the spindle pole bodies and nucleation of spindle microtubule assembly may be partially inhibited. One allele inhibits germ tube formation. The cold sensitivity of two alleles is strongly suppressed by the antimicrotubule agents benomyl and nocodazole and a third allele is essentially dependent on these compounds for growth. Together our data indicate that γ-tubulin probably carries out functions essential to mitosis and organization of cytoplasmic microtubules {{in addition to its}} well-documented role in microtubule nucleation. We have also placed our mutations on a model of the structure of γ-tubulin and these data give a good initial indication of the functionally important regions of the molecule...|$|R

40|$|Die in dieser Arbeit etablierte Insertions-Duplikations-Mutagenese IDM ermöglicht es, das Genom von pathogenen Bakterien zu mutagenisieren und die so generierte Mutantenbank im high-throughput-Format auf Gene zu untersuchen, die unter bestimmten Bedingungen für das infektiöse Potential oder für das Überleben dieser Keime von Bedeutung sind. Die Grundlage von IDM bildet ein konditional replizierender Vektor, in den eine Genbank des Wirtsorganismus kloniert wird und der unter nicht-permissiven Replikationsbedingungen mittels homologer Rekombination ins Chromosom integriert und dadurch einen Gen-Knockout bedingt. Das IDM-Verfahren weist gegenüber der Transposon-Mutagenese den Vorteil auf, dass das Genom nach dem Zufallsprinzip saturierend mutagenisiert werden kann und dass keine {{hot spots}} für die Insertion auftreten. Darüber hinaus kann der mutierte Genlocus nach Screening der Mutanten schnell per PCR identifiziert werden, indem die Exzision des Vektors induziert und das klonierte, homologe Fragment sequenziert wird. Die Insertion des Vektors ins Chromosom und damit der Gen-Knockout ist selbst ohne Selektionsdruck sehr stabil, so dass die Mutanten im Zellkultur- oder Tier-System untersucht werden können. IDM wurde im Rahmen dieser Arbeit erfolgreich auf Salmonella enterica Serovar typhimurium und Listeria monocytogenes angewandt. Die Applikation von IDM auf S. typhimurium hatte zum Ziel, Gene zu identifizieren, deren Produkte für das Überleben dieses Gram-negativen Keims in Vollmedium unter Laborbedingungen essentiell sind. Ausgehend von 14. 000 S. typhimurium Fragmentbank-Klonen konnten durch Induktion der Integration des Vektors 262 Klone identifiziert werden, für welche die Mutation zu einem lethalen Phänotyp führte. 116 der 262 entsprechenden Proteine konnte durch IDM erstmalig eine essentielle Funktion für die Vitalität von S. typhimurium zugewiesen werden. Darunter befinden sich sowohl Proteine, die homolog sind zu Proteinen anderer klinisch-relevanter Keime, als auch Proteine, die Salmonella-spezifisch sind. Der größte Teil der identifizierten Proteine ist in die Speicherung und Weitergabe von Information (Transkription, Translation, DNA-Reparatur etc.) involviert, viele sind allerdings auch Proteine unbekannter Funktion. Die Essentialität der durch IDM identifizierten Gene konnte durch die Konstruktion von konditional lethalen Mutanten bestätigt werden. IDM ist demnach das erste Mutagenese-Verfahren, welches das essentielle Gen-Set von S. typhimurium für das Überleben in Vollmedium zu definieren vermochte. Basierend auf den IDM Daten konnte es auf 511 Gene, d. h. auf 11 % des Gesamt-Genoms beziffert werden. Bei der Applikation von IDM auf L. monocytogenes lag der Fokus auf der Identifizierung von Genen, die für das Überleben dieses Gram-positiven Bakteriums im Zytosol von eukaryontischen Zellen von Bedeutung sind. Im Screening von bis dato 720 der 1491 L. monocytogenes Insertionsmutanten auf ein attenuiertes Replikationsverhalten in Caco- 2 Zellen konnten 69 Mutanten selektioniert werden. In diesen Mutanten sind Gene ausgeknockt, deren Produkte hauptsächlich wichtige Funktionen in der Nährstoffbereitstellung, in der Energiesynthese und im Metabolismus inne haben. Mit der Insertions-Duplikations-Mutagenese IDM steht ein molekulares Werkzeug zur Verfügung, welches für die Identifzierung neuer targets für sowohl Breitband- als auch Spezies-spezifische Antiinfektiva eingesetzt werden kann und welches unbekannten Proteinen eine biologische Funktionen zuweisen kann. Using insertion-duplication-mutagenesis IDM, {{that has been}} {{established}} in this work, it is possible to mutate the genome of pathogenic bacteria and to generate a mutant bank. This bank can be screened in a high throughput format on genes that are relevant under certain conditions for the infectious potential and the survival of these germs. IDM is based on a conditionally replicating vector which integrates into the chromosome under non-permissive replication conditions via homologous recombination after having cloned a gene bank from the host organism into it. The vector integration causes a knockout of the respective gene. In contrast to transposon mutagenesis, the IDM approach has the advantage that the whole genome is mutated and that no mutation hot spots occur. Furthermore, after having screened the mutant bank, the mutated gene locus can be identified very quickly by applicating PCR: excision of the vector is induced and the cloned, homologous fragment is sequenced. Integration of the vector into the chromosome and therefore the gene knockout is very stable even without any selection so that the mutants can be examined in the cell culture and animal model. In this work IDM has been applicated successfully to Salmonella enterica Servovar typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes. Application of IDM to S. typhimurium aimed to identify genes whose products are essential for the survival of that Gram negative germ in rich medium under laboratory conditions. Starting with 14. 000 S. typhimurium fragment-bank clones, induction of integration of the vector led to the identification of 262 clones for which the mutation resulted in a lethal phenotype. For 116 of the 262 respective proteins, this is the first data that assigns to these proteins an essential function for viability of S. typhimurium. Amongst them are proteins that are homologue to proteins of other clinically relevant germs, as well as proteins that are Salmonella specific. Most of the identified proteins are involved in information storage and processing (transcription, translation, DNA repair etc.), but many are proteins of unknown function. The essentiality of the identified genes could be confirmed by construction of <b>conditionally</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutants.</b> Hence, IDM is the first mutagenesis approach that reached to define the essential gene-set of S. typhimurium for survival in rich medium. Based on the IDM data it could be estimated at 511 genes, that means at 11 % of the whole genome. The application of IDM to L. monocytogenes focussed on the identification of genes that play an important role for the survival of that Gram-positive bacterium in the cytosol of eucaryotic cells. Until now 720 of the 1491 L. monocytogenes mutants have been screened on a attenuated replication behaviour in Caco- 2 cells and 69 mutants have been selected. These mutants harbour mutations in genes whose products mainly hold important functions in nutrient uptake, energy synthesis and metabolism. The insertion-duplication-mutagenesis IDM {{has proven to be a}} suitable molecular tool that can be used for the identification of novel targets for both broad spectrum and species-specific antibiotics and that can assign a biological function to unknown proteins...|$|R
