We report {{the development of a}} process yielding hydrogen from natural gas that generates no green house gases and thus meets the Kyoto accord targets. In this process, natural gas is treated in a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) yielding hydrogen and solid carbon according to the following reaction: CH 4 (g) → 2 H 2 (g) + C (s). The direct cracking of the hydrocarbon is possible if the natural gas is injected in the plasma zone, created by the presence of a dielectric ceramic material. It was found that the dielectric material plays an important role on plasma intensity. The change in ceramic properties affects the parameters of the discharge. It was discovered that the number of micro-discharges increased when a ceramic with a higher dielectric constant was used. Furthermore, the ceramic relative permittivity or dielectric constant has a direct influence on the hydrogen yield. However, the challenge is that when using a commercial high dielectric ceramic as barrier they tend to break in the plasma environment. In the attempt of improving the process efficiency medium permittivity dielectric ceramics (9 < K' < 166) were fabricated and successfully tested in the discharge reactor.

As network latency approaches thousands of processor cycles for large scale multiprocessors, conventionalsynchronization techniques are failing {{to keep up with}} the increasing demand for scalable and efficient synchronization op-erations. In this paper, we present a mechanism that allows atomicsynchronization operations to be executed on the home memory controller of the synchronization variable. By perform-ing atomic operations near where the data resides, our proposed mechanism can significantly reduce the number of net-work messages required by synchronization operations. Our proposed design also enhances performance by using fine-grained updates to selectively "push " the results of offloaded synchronization operations back to processors when they com-plete (e. g., when a barrier count reaches the desired value). We use the proposed mechanism to optimize two of themost widely used synchronization operations, barriers and spin locks. Our simulation results show that the proposedmechanism outperforms conventional implementations based on load-linked/store-conditional, processor-centric atomic in-structions, conventional memory-side atomic instructions, or active messages. It speeds up <b>conventional</b> <b>barriers</b> by up to 2. 1 (4 processors) to 61. 9 (256 processors) and spin locks by a factor of up to 2. 0 (4 processors) to 10. 4 (256 processors) ...|$|R
