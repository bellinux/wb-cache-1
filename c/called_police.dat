5|$|Columbus Crew and Toronto FC have {{competed for}} the Trillium Cup since 2008. Although a {{manufactured}} rivalry, the meetings have since sparked bitterness. On March 28, 2009, approximately 1,700 Toronto FC supporters travelled to Columbus Crew Stadium and witnessed a 1–1 draw, {{during which they}} lit a number of flares and allegedly committed vandalism. Following the game some altercations broke out between the two supporter groups. Overwhelmed security <b>called</b> <b>police</b> who ended the melees and made arrests, at which time a TFC fan was tasered while being subdued. The first rematch back in Columbus Crew Stadium following the incident was boycotted by Toronto FC supporters in wake of restrictions imposed on them by Crew officials.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Newman {{devised a}} thriller series for ABC <b>called</b> <b>Police</b> Surgeon, {{starring}} Ian Hendry. Although Police Surgeon {{was not a}} success and was cancelled after only a short run, Newman took Hendry as the star, {{and some of the}} ethos of the programme, to create a new series (not a direct sequel as is sometimes claimed) called The Avengers. Debuting in January 1961, The Avengers became an international success, although in later years its premise differed somewhat from Newman's initial set-up, veering into more humorous territory rather than remaining a gritty thriller.|$|E
5|$|On January 12, 1999, the {{spotlights}} {{surrounding the}} Peace Candle were accidentally turned on, {{and the heat}} from the lights ignited a fire among several of the Christmas trees surrounding the structure. Several residents <b>called</b> <b>police</b> and sprayed the flames with fire extinguishers until city firefighters arrived to put out the blaze. Although flames reached as high as 30 feet, only the trees were damaged and the Peace Candle itself was undamaged. The incident spurred discussion about removing the trees altogether, but Easton officials insisted the fire was just a fluke accident. New spotlights were installed in 2000, which lit the candle from top to bottom and focused on the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E

5|$|Rand {{was portrayed}} by American actress Grace Lee Whitney, who had {{previously}} worked with Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry in both The Lieutenant and a pilot for a show he created <b>called</b> <b>Police</b> Story. Whitney as Rand was involved in promoting Star Trek before it aired, but did {{not appear in the}} first two pilots. Roddenberry set out the role of Rand to Whitney, saying that she and Kirk were meant to have feelings for one another, but should never act on them. Part way through the first season, Whitney was released from her contract. The official explanation was that the production team wanted to free up Kirk to have relationships with other women, but it was actually necessitated because the series was over budget and was looking to cut costs. It is unclear as to who suggested that her contract should be terminated, or who made the final decision. Roddenberry later blamed NBC for her release and said he regretted it. Whitney later directly linked her departure from the show to her alcoholism.|$|E

40|$|This article evaluates whether female {{victims of}} severe physical, psycholog-ical, or sexual {{intimate}} partner violence (IPV) <b>call</b> <b>police</b> {{more often than}} other abused women. Abused women (431) reported frequency of contacting police (dependent variable), nature and severity of IPV experienced, and characteristics {{of themselves and their}} perpetrator (explanatory variables). A two-part regression model estimated likelihood of police contact among all participants and rate of contact among callers. Women with severe physical or psychological IPV or injury were more likely to <b>call</b> <b>police</b> than were other abused women. Among callers, women made 96 % more calls if a weapon was involved, 58 % more if they were severely sexually abused, and 40 % more if they were severely physically abused. Women with children at home made 32 % more calls. These results delineate the level and types of IPV and other characteristics of homes that make single and repeat <b>calls</b> to <b>police...</b>|$|R
