25|$|A biscuit joiner (or {{sometimes}} plate joiner) is a {{woodworking tool}} used to join {{two pieces of}} wood together. A biscuit joiner uses a small circular saw blade to cut a crescent-shaped hole (called the mouth) in the opposite edges of two pieces of wood or wood composite panels. An oval-shaped, highly dried and compressed wooden biscuit (beech or particle wood) is covered with glue, or glue is applied in the slot. The biscuit is immediately placed in the slot, and the two boards are <b>clamped</b> <b>together.</b> The wet glue expands the biscuit, further improving the bond.|$|E

2500|$|The strings {{were played}} by small {{electric}} powered rollers, which were self-rosinating, and a chromatic set of metal 'fingers'. The violin had no finger board. A small metal [...] "finger", activated by an electromagnet, rose {{from under the}} string lifting it in a [...] "V" [...] shaped slot thus stopping off the string. The strings were bowed by four small wheels made of discs of celluloid <b>clamped</b> <b>together</b> in a dish-shaped form. These applied just the right pressure to the strings and were driven by a variable-speed controlled motor. This and a mute allowed the volume of sound produced to be varied. The violin produced a full tone {{and was able to}} sound 1/2 note double stops at ragtime tempi. The staccato coil allowed the bows to leave the string {{a fraction of a second}} before the 'fingers'. The violin stayed in tune by a sophisticated array of tuning arms and weights. The vibrato was produced by using an electromagnet to shake the tail-piece of the violin.|$|E

60|$|For {{a moment}} we could not realize it. Such {{incredible}} baseness was outside all our experiences. Then, as we understood how foolish we had been to trust for an instant a man with such a history, a flush of rage came over us, rage against his villainy and against our own stupidity. We rushed at the door together, beating it with our fists and kicking with our heavy boots. The sound of our blows and of our execrations must have resounded through the Castle. We called to this villain, hurling at him every name which might pierce even into his hardened soul. But the door was enormous--such a door as one finds in mediaeval castles--made of huge beams <b>clamped</b> <b>together</b> with iron. It was as easy to break as a square of the Old Guard. And our cries appeared to be of as little avail as our blows, for they only brought for answer the clattering echoes from the high roof above us. When you have done some soldiering, you soon learn {{to put up with}} what cannot be altered. It was I, then, who first recovered my calmness, and prevailed upon Duroc to join with me in examining the apartment which had become our dungeon.|$|E
6000|$|Her husband (as I sat {{facing them}} both), with his thin bony nose, and a {{perfectly}} bloodless, narrow physiognomy <b>clamped</b> <b>together</b> {{as it were}} by short formal side-whiskers, had nothing of Sir Leicester Dedlock's [...] "grand air" [...] and courtly solemnity. He belonged to the haute bourgeoisie only, and was a banker, with whom a modest credit had been opened for my needs. He was such an ardent--no, such a frozen-up, mummified Royalist that he used in current conversation turns of speech contemporary, I should say, with the good Henri Quatre; and when talking of money matters reckoned not in francs, like the common, godless herd of post-Revolutionary Frenchmen, but in obsolete and forgotten ecus--ecus of all money units in the world!--as though Louis Quatorze were still promenading in royal splendour the gardens of Versailles, and Monsieur de Colbert busy with the direction of maritime affairs. You must admit that in a banker {{of the nineteenth century}} it was a quaint idiosyncrasy. Luckily in the counting-house (it occupied part of the ground floor of the Delestang town residence, in a silent, shady street) the accounts were kept in modern money, so that I never had any difficulty in making my wants known to the grave, low-voiced, decorous, Legitimist (I suppose) clerks, sitting in the perpetual gloom of heavily barred windows behind the sombre, ancient counters, beneath lofty ceilings with heavily moulded cornices. I always felt on going out as though I had been in the temple of some very dignified but completely temporal religion. And it was generally on these occasions that under the great carriage gateway Lady Ded-- I mean Madame Delestang, catching sight of my raised hat, would beckon me with an amiable imperiousness {{to the side of the}} carriage, and suggest with an air of amused nonchalance, [...] "Venez donc faire un tour avec nous," [...] to which the husband would add an encouraging [...] "C'est ca. Allons, montez, jeune homme." [...] He questioned me sometimes, significantly but with perfect tact and delicacy, as to the way I employed my time, and never failed to express the hope that I wrote regularly to my [...] "honoured uncle." [...] I made no secret of the way I employed my time, and I rather fancy that my artless tales of the pilots and so on entertained Madame Delestang, so far as that ineffable woman could be entertained by the prattle of a youngster very full of his new experience amongst strange men and strange sensations. She expressed no opinions, and talked to me very little; yet her portrait hangs in the gallery of my intimate memories, fixed there by a short and fleeting episode. One day, after putting me down at the corner of a street, she offered me her hand, and detained me by a slight pressure, for a moment. While the husband sat motionless and looking straight before him, she leaned forward in the carriage to say, with just a shade of warning in her leisurely tone: [...] "Il faut, cependant, faire attention a ne pas gater sa vie." [...] I had never seen her face so close to mine before. She made my heart beat, and caused me to remain thoughtful for a whole evening. Certainly one must, after all, take care not to spoil one's life. But she did not know--nobody could know--how impossible that danger seemed to me.|$|E
60|$|The {{moonlight}} was {{so bright}} {{that through the}} thick yellow blind the room was light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan Harker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor. Kneeling on the near {{edge of the bed}} facing outwards was the white-clad figure of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black. His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognized the Count, in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. With his left hand he held both Mrs. Harker's hands, keeping them away with her arms at full tension. His right hand gripped her by the back of the neck, forcing her face down on his bosom. Her white nightdress was smeared with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man's bare chest which was shown by his torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a kitten's nose into a saucer of milk to compel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his face, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap into it. His eyes flamed red with devilish passion. The great nostrils of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge, and the white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood dripping mouth, <b>clamped</b> <b>together</b> like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threw his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned and sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet, and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred Wafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside the tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back he cowered, as we, lifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as a great black cloud sailed across the sky. And when the gaslight sprang up under Quincey's match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as we looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting open, had swung back to its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved forward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For a few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face was ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared her lips and cheeks and chin. From her throat trickled a thin stream of blood. Her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face her poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the Count's terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently over her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant despairingly, ran out of the room.|$|E
40|$|AbstractHalving of the {{chromosome}} number during meiosis I {{depends on the}} segregation of maternal and paternal centromeres. This process relies on the attachment of sister centromeres to microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole. We describe here the identification of a protein complex, Csm 1 /Lrs 4, that is essential for monoorientation of sister kinetochores in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both proteins are present in vegetative cells, where they reside in the nucleolus. Only shortly before meiosis I do they leave the nucleolus and form a “monopolin” complex with the meiosis-specific Mam 1 protein, which binds to kinetochores. Surprisingly, Csm 1 's homolog in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Pcs 1, is essential for accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis II. Csm 1 and Pcs 1 might <b>clamp</b> <b>together</b> microtubule binding sites on the same (Pcs 1) or sister (Csm 1) kinetochores...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinching}} process, {{also known}} as “press joining”, is a mechanical joining technique for sheet metal. Its basic principle is to <b>clamp</b> <b>together</b> several metal sheets by an impact extrusion between a punch and a die. The joint is formed by a localized cold plastic deformation.

On the other hand, shear tests on simple joints with one or two clinches were realized and their behaviour is reproduced numerically with LAGAMINE. This work opens the way to the analytical formulation of the behaviour of clinched joints. The article will focus on comparisons between experiments and numerical simulations.

50|$|The boring clam is the {{smallest}} clam in the subfamily Tridacninae and grows to a maximum shell size of 15 cm. It has two, thick valves joined together by a hinge which is typically between a third and less than a half of {{the width of the}} shell. Typically shells are slightly to moderately elongate, and the animal is strongly inflated, especially near the hinge. The upper valve has six to ten flattish folds which interlock at the margin with similar folds on the lower valve so that they can <b>clamp</b> <b>together</b> and the shell can close tightly. The lower valve has slits through which the byssal threads emerge which secure the animal to the seabed. This clam burrows into the substrate and this process tends to wear away the outer surface of the valves and smooth them off. They also may become distorted by burrowing into substrates of uneven hardness.|$|R

40|$|Avian reovirus, an {{important}} avian pathogen, expresses eight structural and four nonstructural proteins. The structural σA protein {{is a major}} component of the inner capsid, <b>clamping</b> <b>together</b> λA building blocks. σA has also been implicated in the resistance of avian reovirus to the antiviral action of interferon by strongly binding double-stranded RNA in the host cell cytoplasm and thus inhibiting activation of the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase. We have solved the structure of bacterially expressed σA by molecular replacement and refined it using data to 2. 3 -Å resolution. Twelve σA molecules are present in the P 1 unit cell, arranged as two short double helical hexamers. A positively charged patch is apparent on the surface of σA on the inside of this helix and mutation of either of two key arginine residues (Arg 155 and Arg 273) within this patch abolishes double-stranded RNA binding. The structural data, together with gel shift assay, electron microscopy, and sedimentation velocity centrifugation results, provide evidence for cooperative binding of σA to double-stranded RNA. The minimal length of double-stranded RNA required for σA binding was observed to be 14 to 18 bp...|$|R

40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) -induced {{cross-linking}} {{was utilized}} {{in order to}} identify histone-DNA interacting regions in the chromatin repeating unit. Fractionated mononucleosomes which contained 185 base pairs of DNA and a full complement of the histones, including histone H 1, were irradiated with light of lambda greater than 290 nm {{in the presence of a}} photosensitizer. Equimolar amounts of histones H 2 A and H 2 B were found, by two independent labeling experiments, to be cross-linked to the DNA. Based on previous finding that the UV irradiation specifically cross-links residues which are in close proximity, irrespective of the nature of the amino acid side chain or the nucleotide involved, our results indicate that the four core histones are not positioned equivalently with respect to the DNA. This arrangement allows histones H 2 A and H 2 B to preferentially cross-link to the DNA. A water soluble covalent complex of DNA and histones was isolated. This complex was partially resistant to mild nuclease digestion, it exhibited a CD spectrum similar to that of chromatin, and was found to contain histone H 1. These results are compatible with a model which suggests that histone H 1, though anchored to the linker, is bound to the DNA at additional sites. By doing so it spans the whole length of the nucleosome and <b>clamps</b> <b>together</b> the DNA fold around the histone core...|$|R
