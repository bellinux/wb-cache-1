All were moneymakers, she assured them, and rattled off her profits glibly. She took their breaths {{away by the}} prices given and {{received}} for pedigreed Persians, pedigreed Ohio Improved Chesters, pedigreed Scotch collies, and pedigreed Jerseys. For the milk of the last {{she also had a}} special private market, receiving five cents more a quart than was fetched by the best dairy milk. Billy was quick to point out the difference between the look of her orchard and the look of the orchard they had inspected the previous afternoon, and Mrs. Mortimer showed him scores of other differences, many of which he was compelled to accept on faith.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1950s {{a group of}} English cat fanciers began working {{together}} with an intent to create a self brown cat of Foreign Type. They called themselves [...] "The Havana Group", later to become [...] "The Chestnut Brown Group". This group of breeders created {{the foundation of the}} Havana Brown cat of today. The ladies credited with this effort include Mrs. Armitage Hargreaves of Laurentide <b>Cattery,</b> Mrs. Munroe-Smith of Elmtower <b>Cattery,</b> the Baroness Von Ullmann of Roofspringer <b>Cattery,</b> Mrs. Elsie Fisher of Praha <b>Cattery,</b> and Mrs. Judd of Crossways <b>Cattery.</b> These breeders, by selectively breeding a Siamese cat which carried the chocolate gene to a black cat that also carried the chocolate gene, were able to produce chestnut (chocolate) colored kittens.|$|E

50|$|The breed {{has been}} {{recognized}} for competition in the US since the late 1950s. It has been considered an endangered breed, since the breeding pool is very small. In the late 1990s, there were only 12 Cat Fanciers' Association-registered Havana Brown <b>catteries</b> and under 130 unaltered cats. Since that time, the breed has grown at a healthy pace.

50|$|FECV is very common, {{especially}} {{in places where}} large groups of cats are kept together (animal shelters, <b>catteries,</b> etc.). Cats become infected by inhaling or ingesting the virus.

40|$|Data were {{gathered}} for 117 cats from 89 <b>catteries</b> {{at an international}} cat show to examine prevalence and risk factors for feline Tritrichomonas foetus and Giardia infection. Prevalence of T. foetus was 31 % among cats (36 out of 117) and <b>catteries</b> (28 out of 89) based on results of fecal smear examination (5 out of 36), fecal culture in modified Diamondâ€™s medium (9 out of 36), fecal culture in In Pouch TF medium (20 out of 36), or PCR amplification of the ribosomal RNA gene from feces with T. foetus-specific primers (34 out of 36). <b>Catteries</b> in which T. foetus was identified {{were more likely to}} have had a recent history of diarrhea, historical diagnosis of coccidia infection in adult cats, and a decreased number of square feet of facility per cat. Evidence did not exist for the ongoing transmission of T. foetus by water, food, or contact with other species. Tritrichomonas foetus was recently identified as a cause of large-bowel diarrhea in domestic cats (6, 7, 10, 15, 16). Based on morphology and sequence identity of rRNA, feline T. foetus is indistinguishable from bovine venereal T. foetus and porcine enteric Tritrichomonas suis (1, 2, 3, 8, 11, 13, 14, 18). The origin of T. foetus and the prevalence of infected cats are unknown. We thus performed an epidemiological study of feline T. foetu...|$|R

50|$|Although {{there was}} a small {{breeding}} program stemming from the last of Pat Turner's cats being kept by Barbara Lambert (Nomis <b>cattery,</b> breeding under FIFe guidelines), this disappeared following her death in the early 2000s. The first modern-day Oriental Bicolours were imported to the UK starting in 2004 with the arrival of Black & White male Tassam Tom of Landican owned by Sarah Johnson and Pat Norman of the Landican <b>Cattery.</b> The variety gained official Preliminary recognition with the GCCF in 2006. In 2008 the breed progressed to Provisional Status, the fastest breed recognition within this organisation and a mark of the breed's popularity and success.|$|E
5000|$|The internationally {{broadest}} organisation is the FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale FÃ©line (FIFe, founded 1948 in Paris, and presently {{based in}} Belgium), {{which is a}} worldwide federation of member cat registries, with a large European and South American presence. The World Cat Federation (WCF, founded 1988 in Rio de Janeiro, presently based in Germany), has a strong presence in Latin America, throughout Western Europe, and in countries of the former USSR).

However, contrary to previous reports, they can be acclimated to colder climates, and do not require special housing any more than similar short-haired, Asian-group cats.|$|R
