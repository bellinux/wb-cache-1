25|$|A {{distinctive}} feature of Odissi {{is that it}} includes both North and South Indian Ragas, which in 20th-century scholarship has been grouped as the Hindustani and the Carnatic music. According to Alessandra Royo, Odissi music integrates the music styles {{of the two major}} Indian music concert traditions, and does not have a separate systematic classification like those found in the North and South Indian traditions. According to Emmie Nijenhuis, Odissi music suggests performance arts and ideas were exchanged between the North and South India during the medieval era, and Odissi accepted both as a creative <b>crucible</b> <b>of</b> styles and ideas.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{political}} {{aspect of the}} first Louis-Schmeling bout would later be dwarfed by the <b>crucible</b> <b>of</b> the later 1938 rematch, brewing political sentiment would inevitably attach itself to the fight. Adolf Hitler had become chancellor of Germany three years previously and, although the United States and Germany were not yet political or military enemies, there was some tension building among the two countries as the Nazi Party began asserting its pro-Aryan, anti-Jewish ideology. Schmeling's Jewish manager, Joe Jacobs, set up Schmeling's training at a Jewish resort in the Catskills, hoping it would help mollify Jewish fight fans.|$|E
25|$|Glassblowing {{involves}} three furnaces. The first, {{which contains}} a <b>crucible</b> <b>of</b> molten glass, is simply {{referred to as}} the furnace. The second is called the glory hole, and is used to reheat a piece in between steps of working with it. The final furnace is called the lehr or annealer, and is used to slowly cool the glass, over a period of a few hours to a few days, {{depending on the size of}} the pieces. This keeps the glass from cracking or shattering due to thermal stress. Historically, all three furnaces were contained in one structure, with a set of progressively cooler chambers for each of the three purposes.|$|E
