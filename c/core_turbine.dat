40|$|The Blended-Wing-Body is a {{conceptual}} aircraft design with rear-mounted, over wing engines. Turboelectric distributed propulsion system with boundary layer ingestion {{has been considered}} for this aircraft. It uses electricity to transmit power from the <b>core</b> <b>turbine</b> to the fans, therefore dramatically increases bypass ratio {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and noise. This dissertation presents methods on designing the TeDP system, evaluating effects of boundary layer ingestion, modelling engine performances, and estimating weights of the electric components. The method is first applied to model a turboshaft-driven TeDP system, which produces thrust only by the propulsors array. Results show that by distributing an array of propulsors that ingest a relatively large mass flow directly produces an 8 % fuel burn saving relative to the commercial N+ 2 aircraft (such as the SAX- 40 airplane). Ingesting boundary layer achieves a 7 - 8 % fuel saving with a well-designed intake duct and the improved inlet flow control technologies. However, the value is sensitive to the duct losses and fan inlet distortion. Poor inlet performance can offset or even overwhelm this potential advantage. The total weight of the electric system would be around 5, 000 - 7, 000 kg. The large mass penalties further diminish benefits of the superconducting distributed propulsion system. The method is then applied to model a turbofan-driven TeDP system, which produces thrust by both the propulsors array and the core-engines. Results show that splitting the thrust between propulsors and core-engines could have a beneficial effect in fuel savings, when installation effects are neglected. The optimised thrust splitting ratio is between 60 - 90 %, the final value depends on the propulsor intake pressure losses and the TeDP system bypass ratio. Moreover, splitting the thrust can reduce the weight of the electric system with the penalty of the increased core-engine weight. In short, if the power density of the superconducting system were high enough, turboshaft-driven TeDP would be preferable to power the N 3 -X aircraf...|$|E

5000|$|The {{turbine blades}} expanded, however, {{contacting}} the honeycomb labyrinth seals {{and allowing the}} metal to scrape together when the engine overheated, with zero core rotation. When the engine is shut down at altitude, the core begins to cool, and the stator, including the static interstage static seal (ISS), contracts {{at a faster rate}} than the adjacent rotating parts in both the radial and axial direction because of its smaller thermal time constant. The relative rate of cooling of the stator and rotor results in an alignment of the rotating-seal knife edges aft of the normal operating groove in the static seal. If the clearances are tight enough and the relative cooling rates are right, contact can occur between the static and rotating seal elements. The resulting stiction can temporarily prevent the rotor from turning when only the force of ram air is applied to the <b>core.</b> Air <b>turbine</b> starter (ATS) torque has been shown adequate to overcome this restriction. Thus, when the engine cooled, the assembly did not match anymore, and the blades could not rotate freely.

Flows through a three-bladed turbine with solidity 0. 125 are simulated at field-test blade Reynolds numbers, O(10 (5) - 10 (6)), for three different cross-stream blockages: 12. 5, 25 and 50 per cent. Two representations of the free-surface boundary are considered: rigid lid and deformable free surface. Increasing the blockage is observed to lead to substantial increases in the power coefficient; the highest power coefficient computed is 1. 23. Only small differences are observed between the two free-surface representations, with the deforming free-surface turbine out-performing the rigid lid turbine by 6. 7 per cent in power at the highest blockage considered. This difference is attributed {{to the increase in}} effective blockage owing to the deformation of the free surface. Hydrodynamic efficiency, the ratio of useful power generated to overall power removed from the flow, is found to increase with blockage, which is consistent with the presence of a higher flow velocity through the <b>core</b> of the <b>turbine</b> at higher blockage ratios.

The noise sources accounted for include fan inlet and exhaust, jet, flap (for powered lift), <b>core</b> (combustor), <b>turbine,</b> and airframe. Noise propagation corrections {{are available in the}} program for atmospheric attenuation, ground reflections, extra ground attenuation, and shielding. The capacity to solve the geometrical relationships between an aircraft in flight and an observer on the ground has been included in the program to make it useful in evaluating noise estimates and footprints for various proposed engine installations. The program contains two main routines for employing the noise prediction routines. The first main routine consists of a procedure to calculate at various observer stations the time history of the noise from an aircraft flying at a specified set of speeds, orientations, and space coordinates. The various components of the noise are computed by the program. For each individual source, the noise levels are free field with no corrections for propagation losses other than spherical divergence. The total spectra may then be corrected for the usual effects of atmospheric attenuation, extra ground attenuation, ground reflection, and aircraft shielding. Next, the corresponding values of overall sound pressure level, perceived noise level, and tone-weighted perceived noise level are calculated. From the time history at each point, true effective perceived noise levels are calculated. Thus, values of effective perceived noise levels, maximum perceived noise levels, and tone-weighted perceived noise levels are found for a grid of specified points on the ground. The second main routine is designed to give the usual format of one-third octave sound pressure level values at a fixed radius for a number of user-selected angles, such as would simulate the ground acoustic testing of an engine. This computer program is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has been implemented on an IBM 360 series computer with a central memory requirement of approximately 120 K of 8 bit bytes. This program was developed in 1981...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} is a technical summary of and outlook for NASA-internal and NASA-sponsored external research on <b>core</b> (combustor and <b>turbine)</b> noise {{funded by the}} Fundamental Aeronautics Program Fixed Wing Project. The presentation covers: the emerging importance of core noise due to turbofan design trends and its relevance to the NASA N+ 3 noise-reduction goal; the core noise components and {{the rationale for the}} current emphasis on combustor noise; and the current and planned research activities in the combustor-noise area. Two NASA-sponsored research programs, with particular emphasis on indirect combustor noise, "Acoustic Database for Core Noise Sources", Honeywell Aerospace (NNC 11 TA 40 T) and "Measurement and Modeling of Entropic Noise Sources in a Single-Stage Low-Pressure Turbine", U. Illinois/U. Notre Dame (NNX 11 AI 74 A) are briefly described. Recent progress in the development of CMC-based acoustic liners for broadband noise reduction suitable for turbofan-core application is outlined. Combustor-design trends and the potential impacts on combustor acoustics are discussed. A NASA GRC developed nine-point lean-direct-injection (LDI) fuel injector is briefly described. The modification of an upcoming thermo-acoustic instability evaluation of the GRC injector in a combustor rig to also provide acoustic information relevant to community noise is presented. The NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Program has the principal objective of overcoming today's national challenges in air transportation. The reduction of aircraft noise is critical to enabling the anticipated large increase in future air traffic. The Quiet Performance Research Theme of the Fixed Wing Project aims to develop concepts and technologies to dramatically reduce the perceived community noise attributable to aircraft with minimal impact on weight and performance...|$|R
