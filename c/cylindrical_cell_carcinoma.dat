40|$|Abstract Background Papillary renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> {{is a rare}} cancer. Some {{cases can}} be {{attributed}} to individuals with hereditary renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> usually consisting of the clear cell subtype. In addition, two syndromes with hereditary papillary renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> have been described. One is the hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> which is characterized by cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas and renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> mostly consisting of the papillary renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> type II with a worse prognosis. Case presentation We describe a case of a 30 -year-old woman with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> syndrome with extensively metastasized papillary renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> primarily diagnosed in a cervical lymph node lacking leiomyomas at any site. Conclusion Papillary renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> in young patients should be further investigated for a hereditary variant like the hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> even if leiomyomas could not be detected. A detailed histological examination and search for mutations is essential for the survival of patients and relatives. </p...|$|R

Fifty-four non-melanoma skin cancers (24 basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> 14 squamous <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> and 16 cases of Bowen's disease) were examined for loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 9. Allelic loss at one or more loci on chromosome 9 was observed in 14 of 24 basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> four of 14 squamous <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> and three of 16 cases of Bowen's disease. Allelic deletion of one or more 9 q markers was seen in 14 basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> three squamous <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> and three cases of Bowen's disease.

40|$|Purpose: An {{increasing}} {{incidence and}} improved prognosis of kidney cancer {{have led to}} concern about second primary malignancies. The study of multiple primary malignancies is also important since the association of certain malignancies may guide the search for germline alterations and environmental risk factors. We evaluated bidirectional associations between renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> and other primary cancers. Materials and Methods: We studied 8, 030 patients with renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> based on the Swedish Family-Cancer Database. The SIR of second cancer was calculated by comparing it to the rate of first cancers. Followup was started in 1993 and continued through 2006. Results: A total of 677 patients had second cancers after the first renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> including 89 second renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> In 776 patients renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> was diagnosed after another primary cancer. Histology concordant renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> pairs showed a SIR of 31. 04 and 15. 15 after clear cell and total renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> respectively. The highest SIR of 132. 46 was noted for synchronous contralateral clear <b>cell</b> renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> A reciprocally increased risk of renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> was seen after lung, breast, prostate, bladder, thyroid gland, adrenal gland and nervous system cancer as well as after melanoma and nonHodgkin's lymphoma.

Twenty-five sporadic renal tumors with prominent papillary architecture and without somatic c-met mutations were evaluated for comparison. All papillary renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> with c-met mutations were 75 to 100 % papillary/tubulopapillary in architecture and showed chromophil basophilic, papillary renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> type 1 histology. Fuhrman nuclear grade 1 – 2 was seen in tumors from 23 patients, and nuclear grade 3 was observed focally in 8 patients. Seventeen patients had multiple papillary adenomas and microscopic papillary lesions in the surrounding renal parenchyma. Clear cells with intracytoplasmic lipid and glycogen were focally present in tumors of 94 % papillary renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> patients. Clear <b>cells</b> of papillary renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> had small basophilic nuclei, and clear cell areas lacked a fine vascular network characteristic of conventional (clear) <b>cell</b> renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> We conclude that papillary renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> patients with c-met mutations develop multiple, bilateral, papillary macroscopic and microscopic renal lesions.

The outcome, therapy responses, and the applicability of molecular-targeted therapies depend on the tumor classification and on the tumor stage. Recent advances within the biomarker research facilitated the exact classification of the molecular character of the renal tumor. For example, the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin and S- 100 A 1 are characteristically expressed in renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> subgroups. This led us to investigate {{the expression of the}} novel calcium-binding protein secretagogin in renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> Tissue microarray cylinders including 94 clear-cell renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> 61 non-clear-cell renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (37 papillary renal cell and 24 chromophobe carcinomas), and 30 oncocytomas were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. This showed remarkable secretagogin expression in 37 % of the clear-cell renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> Non-clear-cell renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> and oncocytomas were completely negative. Consequently performed immunoblotting analyses confirmed this expression profile. Because publicly available data direct toward a formation of a hierarchical cluster of secretagogin overexpressing clear-cell renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> we conducted a clinical follow-up of the patients with clear-cell renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> This revealed significantly more metastasis within the secretagogin-positive clear-cell renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> subgroup (49 % versus 28 %; P <. 05).
