5|$|At Somnia, {{the hero}} meets Carver, which doesn't seem to {{remember}} the hero. The Hero then meets Captain Blade, leader of Somnia's military which gives the potential soldier candidates a task to find a special item in a tower. The hero manages to find this item successfully and formally becomes a soldier of Somnia. After a task which the Hero and Carver work together to get a horse for an old man, Carver also becomes a soldier of Somnia and himself and the hero are given permission {{to talk to the}} king where they learn to defeat Murdaw, they need the Mirror of Ra. The Hero and Carver discover another portal similar to the one near Haggleton, which eventually leads them to Port Haven, another town where they <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen.</b> Milly, also appearing to have lost her memory, does see them and helps them become visible via Madame Luca's help.|$|E
25|$|Water polo is {{a contact}} sport, with little {{protective}} gear besides swim suits and caps with ear protectors and thus injuries are common. Among {{the most frequent}} serious injuries are those affecting the head and shoulders. Those induced to the head are usually caused by elbows or the ball itself, while shoulder injuries {{are a result of}} grabbing or pushing while shooting or passing. Other injuries take place underwater, such as leg and groin injuries, as many things <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> from above the surface and not much padding is used to protect the players.|$|E
25|$|Dipolog City Hall - Built on July 1, 1913, {{under the}} {{administration}} of General John J. Pershing. The original design of the town wall was the exact replica of the town hall of Maribojoc, Bohol, which was designed by the Americans. The original hall was exactly the same size that of Maribojoc's down {{to the size of}} the jail. But today the hall was expanded and its original design <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> anymore. It's located near the Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary Cathedral and the Plaza Magsaysay. The hall building was constructed under {{the administration of}} Mayor Fermin D. Kagatan. The corner street houses the Monument of Three Prominent Dipolognons namely Pascual T. Martinez, the first appointed Mayor of Dipolog in 1913-1918; Rev. Fr. Nicasio Y. Patangan, the first Filipino Diocesan Priest of Mindanao; and Eugenio R. Margate, a farmer for 25 years who introduced the Margate System of Planting Rice.|$|E

They realise {{that there are things}} that are true {{despite the fact that they}} <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> or understood. They just learned a lesson of faith. Hassel also thought that Theseus' speech on the lunatic, the lover, and the poet is an applause to imagination. But it is also a laughing rejection of futile attempts to perceive, categorise, or express it.|$|E

2500|$|Because the splint bone {{does have}} some {{mobility}} independent of the cannon bone, it can cause tension and strain on the periosteum of the splint bone where the interosseous ligament attaches. The horse will then lay down new bone and the area will become inflamed. [...] "Blind splints" [...] are named because the bony reaction happens on the inside border between the splint bone and cannon bone, where it <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen,</b> and is usually not palpable. Besides causing pain as any active splint reaction can, the swelling can impinge on the suspensory ligament. This condition is difficult to diagnose, but ultrasound is generally diagnostic. [...] MRI and CT also show these well.|$|E
2500|$|The {{policy of}} the government, called samarbejdspolitikken (cooperation policy) {{is one of the}} most {{controversial}} issues in Danish history. Some historians argue that the relatively accommodating policy which did not actively resist the occupation was the only realistic way of safeguarding Danish democracy and people. However, others argue that accommodation was taken too far, was uniquely compliant when compared to other democratic governments in Europe, and <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as part of a coherent long-term strategy to protect democracy in Denmark or Europe. In 2003 Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen characterised the cooperation as [...] "morally unjustifiable," [...] the only time a Danish leader had condemned the war-era leadership, even though Anders Fogh Rasmussen is seen using it as a justification for his own ambitions, in connection with the invasion of Iraq in 2003.|$|E
2500|$|Social {{networking}} {{sites such}} as Facebook are occasionally used to emotionally abuse, harass or bully individuals, either by posting defamatory statements or by forwarding private digital photos or videos that can have an adverse impact on the individuals depicted in the videos. Such actions are {{often referred to as}} [...] "trolling". Confrontations in the real world can also be transferred to the online world. [...] Trolling can occur in many different forms, such as (but not limited to) defacement of deceased person(s) tribute pages, name-calling, playing online pranks on individuals and making controversial or inflammatory comments with the intention to cause anger and cause arguments. Individuals troll for many reasons. The psychology behind why people troll according to Psychology Today is due to anonymity, perceived obscurity, and a perceived lack of consequences for online misbehavior. Trolls may also do their activities due to a perceived majority status, social identity salience and due to a sense by the troll that she or he is surrounded by online 'friends'. Trolls may also engage in harmful acts due to desensitization or negative personality traits (Fox, 2014). As these eight reasons behind the thought processes of trolls suggest individuals thrive behind being able to create a false identity or pseudonym to hide behind and the premise that they have 'friends' on social networks that agree with their outlook on certain topics, thus join in on trolling. The idea behind the perceived lack of consequences is because they believe they have created an identity in which they <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as a real life human and more of a persona/avatar that they have created, which leads them to feel that they will not face the consequences of being an online troll.|$|E

In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the linear and non-linear causality relationship between mainland China {{stock market and}} Hong Kong H-share market over January 1994 -December 2007 period, which is divided into four periods marked by Asian financial crisis in 1997 {{and the opening of}} China's B-shares to domestic investors in 2001, as well as by split-share structure reform in 2005. Nonlinear Granger causality testing proposed by Himestra and Jones (1994) has been used and a new Monte-Carlo simulation method was induced to calculate the confidence level. The results of non-linear causality tests show that there exists non-linear causality between the two markets during the sample period. However, this causality relationship varies in different periods, which <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> from the linear test results...|$|R

It is partitioned lengthwise, and through one compartment walked such as bore light sentences in ancient times, and through the other marched sadly the wretches whom the Three had doomed to lingering misery and utter oblivion in the dungeons, or to sudden and mysterious death. Down below the level of the water, by the light of smoking torches, we were shown the damp, thick-walled cells where many a proud patrician's life was eaten away by the long-drawn miseries of solitary imprisonment--without light, air, books; naked, unshaven, uncombed, covered with vermin; his useless tongue forgetting its office, with none to speak to; the days and nights of his life no longer marked, but merged into one eternal eventless night; far away from all cheerful sounds, buried in the silence of a tomb; forgotten by his helpless friends, and his fate a dark mystery to them forever; losing his own memory at last, and knowing no more who he was or how he came there; devouring the loaf of bread and drinking the water that were thrust into the cell by unseen hands, and troubling his worn spirit no more with hopes and fears and doubts and longings to be free; ceasing to scratch vain prayers and complainings on walls where none, not even himself, could see them, and resigning himself to hopeless apathy, driveling childishness, lunacy! Many and many a sorrowful story like this these stony walls could tell if they could but speak.|$|E

40|$|In {{this project}} {{we have worked}} with {{streaming}} and its influence on society. We have chosen {{to focus on the}} streaming service Spotify, {{which is one of the}} most popular in Denmark. Our interest is to examine how a technology like streaming has been integrated in our society and how streaming influences our everyday life. Our primary focus is the young users because they are the main consumers of music. It is common to listen to music anywhere, all the time on our smartphones and iPods. Many people in Denmark are using streaming services and most use it every day. Therefore, we find it interesting to analyse how a certain technology like streaming becomes a part of so many peoples everyday life and how this interaction between technology plays out. We have used the method Focus-group interview which gave us insight in three peoples interaction with streaming: how, where, when and why they use it. The theory ‘Domestication’, ‘Science Technology Society’ and ‘Gripsrud’ have given us the tools to analyse technology and humans interaction. Our analyses has shown us that technology and humans <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> as individuals. One constantly influences the other and develop morals and norms around a technology together. We also found out that it is difficult to determine a certain moral or norm of a technology, because people are different and, as such, will always interact differently with a certain technology...|$|R
