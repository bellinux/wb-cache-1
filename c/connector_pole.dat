40|$|ABSTRACT We have {{isolated}} a nucleus-basal body complex from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The {{complex is}} strongly immunoreactive to an antibody generated against a major protein constituent of isolated Tetraselmis striata flagellar roots (Salisbury, J. L., A. Baron, B. Surek, and M. Melkonian, J. Cell Biol., 99 : 962 - 970). Electrophoretic and immunoelectrophoretic analysis indicates that, like the Tetraselmis protein, the Chlamydomonas antigen {{consists of two}} acidic isoforms of ~ 20 kD. Indirect immunofluorescent staining of nucleus-basal body complexes reveals two major fibers in the connector region, one between each basal body and the nucleus. The nucleus is also strongly immunoreactive, with staining radiating around much of the nucleus from a region of greatest concentration at the <b>connector</b> <b>pole.</b> Calcium treatment causes shortening of the connector fibers and also movement of nuclear DNA towards the <b>connector</b> <b>pole.</b> Electron microscopic observation of negatively stained nucleus-basal body complexes reveals a cluster of ~ 6 -nm filaments, suspected to represent the connector, between the basal bodies and nuclei. A mutant with a variable number of flagella, vfl- 2 - 220, is defective {{with respect to the}} nucleus-basal body association. This observation encourages us to speculate that the nucleusbasa...|$|E

Melkonian, J. Cell Biol., 99 : 962 - 970). Electrophoretic and immunoelectrophoretic analysis indicates that, like the Tetraselmis protein, the Chlamydomonas antigen {{consists of two}} acidic isoforms of approximately 20 kD. Indirect immunofluorescent staining of nucleus- basal body complexes reveals two major fibers in the connector region, one between each basal body and the nucleus. The nucleus is also strongly immunoreactive, with staining radiating around much of the nucleus from a region of greatest concentration at the <b>connector</b> <b>pole.</b> Calcium treatment causes shortening of the connector fibers and also movement of nuclear DNA towards the <b>connector</b> <b>pole.</b> Electron microscopic observation of negatively stained nucleus-basal body complexes reveals a cluster of approximately 6 -nm filaments, suspected to represent the connector, between the basal bodies and nuclei. A mutant with a variable number of flagella, vfl- 2 - 220, is defective {{with respect to the}} nucleus-basal body association. This observation encourages us to speculate that the nucleus-basal body union is important for accurate basal body localization within the cell and/or for accurate segregation of parental and daughter basal bodies at cell division. A physical association between nuclei and basal bodies or centrioles has been observed in a variety of algal, protozoan, and metazoan cells, although the nature of the association, in terms of both structure and function, has been obscure. We believe it likely that fibrous connectors homologous to those described here for Chlamydomonas are general features of centriole-bearing eucaryotic cells...|$|E

50|$|A framer is a {{carpenter}} who builds the skeletal structure or wooden framework of buildings, {{most often in}} the platform framing method. Historically, balloon framing was used until the 1950s when fire safety concerns made platform framing inherently better. A carpenter who specializes in building with timbers rather than studs {{is known as a}} timber framer and does traditional timber framing with wooden joints, including mortise-and-tenon joinery, post and beam work with metal <b>connectors,</b> or <b>pole</b> building framing.|$|R
50|$|Where more current {{carrying}} capacity is required, such as between generator sets and distribution boards, VEAM Powerlocks or Cam-Loks may be used. These <b>connectors</b> are single <b>pole</b> so five are required to accommodate all three phases, neutral and ground. Powerlocks have a rating of 400 A or 660 A at 1 kV. Cam-Lok E1016 Series are rated at 600 V 400 A.|$|R
40|$|For many years, NEC (National Electric Coil) has {{provided}} hydrogenerator refurbishment services to several U. S. Government agencies and large investor owned utilities. These projects have involved complete rehabilitation and refurbishment of large hydrogenerators. The work-scopes typically involved {{replacement of the}} stator cores, new stator windings, and refurbished and reinsulated rotor field windings. One might assume that refurbishment of field poles would be a simple task, when compared to much more complex stator core and stator winding replacement work scopes. On the contrary, NEC has identified several complex issues in the field pole rehabilitation on older hydrogenerators. Such problems as bowing of the rotor field poles, looseness of the field poles on the rotor, fatigue of field <b>pole</b> <b>connectors,</b> and cracking of field pole damper bars, are examples of problems identified as part of these large refurbishment projects. In this paper, several of the problems encountered will be fully described, along {{with the consequences of}} the problem in terms of operational difficulties. Solutions developed during the project will be presented as well as complete recommendations to prevent reoccurrence. This paper will be useful for owners of older hydrogenerator plants, who may be entering into a large refurbishment project. Prior knowledge of these types of problems may save time and money in the refurbishment project and improve reliability over the operational life of the unit...|$|R
40|$|Aging {{analyses}} were performed on solder joints from two radar units: (1) a laboratory, N 57 tube-type radar unit and (2) a field-returned, B 61 - 0, tube-type radar unit. The cumulative temperature environments experienced by the units during aging were calculated from the intermetallic compound layer thickness and the mean Pb-rich phase particle size metrics for solder joints in the units, assuming an aging time of 35 years for both radars. Baseline aging metrics were obtained from a laboratory test vehicle assembled at AS/FM and T; the aging kinetics of both metrics were calculated from isothermal aging experiments. The N 57 radar unit interconnect board solder joints exhibited very little aging. The eyelet solder joints did show cracking that most likely occurred {{at the time of}} assembly. The eyelet, SA 1126 connector solder joints, showed some delamination between the Cu pad and underlying laminate. The B 61 field-returned radar solder joints showed a nominal degree of aging. Cracking of the eyelet solder joints was observed. The Pb-rich phase particle measurements indicated additional aging of the interconnects as a result of residual stresses. Cracking of the terminal <b>pole</b> <b>connector,</b> pin-to-pin solder joint was observed; but it was not believed to jeopardize the electrical functionality of the interconnect. Extending the stockpile lifetime of the B 61 tube-type radar by an additional 20 years would not be impacted by the reliability of the solder joints with respect to further growth of the intermetallic compound layer. Additional coarsening of the Pb-rich phase will increase the joints' sensitivity to thermomechanical fatigue...|$|R
