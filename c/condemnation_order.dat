Prince George, a key centre for Aboriginal European interaction in the BC interior, drew various people to the opportunities on offer. For many indigenous peoples however, opportunities were hard to realize, and urban poverty persisted. Located just before the rivers meet is {{a place called the}} Island Cache, where a community of settlers took up residence in the 1920 s. The area was initially an island separated by a flood channel, and so for the Cache’s entire history, flooding was an issue. The Cache was a very different place than the city on its border, but in 1970, it was incorporated, and a period of escalating political turmoil began. Integration was swift and decisive, and accomplished through by-laws, <b>condemnation</b> <b>orders,</b> and bulldozers; the event triggering it was a flood. This is a brief history of the Island Cache. It is about rivers and the lands around them; it is about floods of water and of power; it is about dykes, and the ground they are built on; and it is about the communities that build dykes and why they fail. The Cache was lost because power, like water, can seep into people’s lives, around and under attempts to protect their communities, unseen until it is too late, and both house and home are swept away. Pushed to margins of society, the people of the Cache survived as best they could. They created a vibrant community, but because it was very different than that of those with power, “progress” meant the end of the Cache. But it is better to read this story from its beginning...|$|R

He does not ask, What is it within the Catholic Church (or a Christian church) that you deem so worthwhile that you are willing to bear harsh <b>condemnation</b> in <b>order</b> to pursue it?

In fact the Lettre et consultation is an anti-Masonic work from a papist standpoint; it filled a canonical vacuum (the non-registering of papal bulls) unwelcome to both Ultra-montains and Gallicans, for opposite, if complementary, reasons. For the former, Masonry favoured toleration and pro-Hanoverian leanings, while for the latter, under the guise of Gallicanism, it prepared the ground for the Jesuits. Porset Charles.

Along with the Abbé Ferdinand Portal he played a prominent role in the attempt to bring about dialogue between the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England on the subject of Anglican Orders. Owing to what can only be viewed as a form of obstructionism between Canterbury and Westminster, no constructive dialogue ever came about, however, and the unhoped for result of Halifax's actions was the <b>condemnation</b> of Anglican <b>Orders</b> as [...] "absolutely null and utterly void" [...] in the Papal Encyclical Apostolicae curae. The Archbishop of Canterbury Edward White Benson and the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Herbert Vaughan, can be accused of letting this early attempt at reapproachment fall away due to the narrow-minded vision of each other's place in the English Church during that era. It might also be argued that Pope Leo XIII was led astray by Vaughan and like-minded Roman Catholic scholars who viewed the Church of England as a state church with no real theological authority.

5000|$|Congress had {{previously}} given {{the federal government}} the power to seek eminent domain in the Act of April 24, 1888 ("An act to facilitate the prosecution of works projected {{for the improvement of}} rivers and harbors", 25 Stat. 94), which provided for <b>condemnation</b> proceedings in <b>order</b> to improve rivers or harbors, and which also required the federal government to seek eminent domain only in state courts. It amended this act on June 29, 1906, to permit condemnation proceedings even if the exercise of eminent domain solely benefited private parties. But the Condemnation Act of 1888 is much broader than either of these other statutes, as it allows any federal official to seek condemnation proceedings, allows condemnation for any [...] "public purpose", and allows federal officials to proceed in either federal or state court. The authority of federal officials to exercise their powers under the Act was challenged by private citizens and the state of Missouri in the 1940s. In United States v. Carmack, 329 U.S. 230 (1946), the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the federal government's eminent domain powers under the Condemnation Act and further upheld the government's right to exercise eminent domain over land containing buildings owned by a state or local government. In United States v. Gettysburg Electric Ry. Co., 160 U.S. 668 (1896), the Supreme Court held that the Condemnation Act covered condemnation to acquire land for historic preservation purposes. This is a crucial precedent establishing broad federal authority to preserve historic sites. The Supreme Court also relied on a general reading of the Act in Olson v. United States, 292 U.S. 246 (1934), when it decided that the highest value of a piece of land could be taken into consideration in eminent domain proceedings but was not the only factor to be used in determining the fair market value of the land.|$|R

It {{is also known}} as infectious serositis and goose influenza. Riemerella anatipestifer infection accounts for major economic losses to industry through death, weight loss, and <b>condemnation.</b> In <b>order</b> to control this infection, it is necessary to develop an effective vaccine. According to cam gene sequence(Crasta et al., 2002), we produced the recombinant protein Cam by use the pET System. Besides this, we cultured the Riemerella anatipestifer in an iron lacked environment, and then extracted the outer membrane protein. Furthermore, because of the recent studies showed that use the interleukin as an adjuvant can improve cell mediate immune responses. So we prepared eight types of vaccine: bacterin contained approximately 109 CFU of RA/ml; bacterin contained 5 × 108 CFU of RA/ml; bacterin contained 5 × 108 CFU of RA and 100 μg Cam recombinant protein/ml; bacterin contained 5 × 108 CFU of RA and 0. 125 ml OMP/ml; bacterin contained 5 × 108 CFU of RA and 2 μg IL- 18 /ml; bacterin contained 5 × 108 CFU of RA, 100 μg Cam recombinant protein, 0. 125 ml OMP, and 2 μg IL- 18 /ml; 100 μg Cam recombinant protein/ml; 0. 125 ml OMP/ml. The experiment was divided into A-I 9 groups, and each group immuned different vaccine individually. All vaccines were injected subcutaneously in the neck of day-old mule ducks. Ducklings were challenged subcutaneously in the neck at 2 weeks of age. According to challenged dose, each group divided 4 subgroups(3. 5 × 109 CFU, 3. 5 × 108 CFU, 3. 5 × 107 CFU, and 3. 5 × 106 CFU /duck), in order to determined each groups' LD 50. Mortality was recorded for a period of 14 days after challenge. And then killed surviving ducks, recorded gross lesion. The result of experiment prove that only used Cam recombinant protein or OMP(at iron lacked environment) can't provide enough protection. And add those kinds of proteins in bacterin(contained 5 × 108 CFU of RA/ml) all can get quite improvement. 第一章 緒言……………………………………………… 1 第二章 文獻探討………………………………………… 2 第一節 Riemerella anatipestifer之歷史背景…… 2 第二節 Riemerella anatipestifer 生物學特性… 2 第三節 血清學分類…………………………………… 3 第四節 Riemerella anatipestifer感染症………… 3 2 - 4. 1 自然宿主…………………………… 4 2 - 4. 2 臨床症狀與病理病變……………… 4 2 - 4. 3 感染及傳播途徑…………………… 5 第五節 Riemerella anatipestifer毒力因子之研究 5 2 - 5. 1 VapD 1 ……………………………… 5 2 - 3. 2 CAMP cohemolysin……………… 5 第六節 於缺鐵環境下細菌細胞膜之改變…………… 6 第七節 Interleukin於疫苗之應用………………… 7 第八節 Riemerella anatipestifer疫苗之發展…… 7 2 - 8. 1 全菌菌苗…………………………… 7 2 - 8. 2 Riemerella anatipestifer次單位疫苗的研究 7 第三章 材料與方法…………………………………………… 9 第一節 Riemerella anatipestifer之分離與鑑定… 9 3 - 1. 1 Riemerella anatipestifer之分離………… 9 3 - 1. 2 聚合酶連鎖反應鑑定……………… 9 3 - 1. 3 BIOLOG 96 項生化測定鑑定試驗……………… 11 第二節 各菌株之分群………………………………… 11 3 - 2. 1 高度免疫血清之製備…………………………… 11 3 - 2. 2 平板凝集試驗………………………………… 12 第三節 菌株毒力試驗………………………………… 12 第四節 Cam重組蛋白之製備………………………… 12 3 - 4. 1 重組載體之構築………………………………… 12 3 - 4. 2 第二次重組載體之構築………………………… 14 3 - 4. 3 Cam重組蛋白之表現與純化…………………… 16 第五節 RA菌外膜蛋白之製備………………………… 18 第六節 IL- 18 之製備………………………………… 18 第七節 疫苗之製備…………………………………… 19 3 - 7. 1 RA生長曲線建立立…………………………… 19 3 - 7. 2 疫苗之製作……………………………………… 19 第八節 疫苗之動物試驗……………………………… 20 第四章 結果……………………… [...] …………………………… 21 第一節 分離菌株之分群……………………………… 21 第二節 毒力試驗……………………………………… 21 第三節 Cam重組蛋白之製備………………………… 21 4 - 3. 1 Cam基因之增幅………………………………… 21 4 - 3. 2 含cam 基因之重組載體構築…………………… 21 4 - 3. 3 重組蛋白之電泳分析與確認………………… 22 第四節 IL- 18 之製備………………………………… 22 第五節 G 28 菌株生長曲線之建立…………………… 22 第六節 疫苗之動物實驗……………………………… 23 4 - 6. 1 LD 50 的計算…………………………………… 23 4 - 6. 2 對鴨隻增重之影響……………………………… 23 4 - 6. 3 疫苗對臟器保護力之比較……………………… 23 4 - 6. 4 疫苗之綜合評估………………………………… 24 第五章 討論……………………… [...] …………………………… 40 參考文獻…………………………………………………………… 4...|$|R
