Integrity is ensuring {{that the act of}} seizing and acquiring digital media does not modify the evidence (either the original or the copy). Authenticity refers to the ability to confirm the integrity of information; for example that the imaged media matches the original evidence. The ease with which digital media can be modified means that documenting the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>custody</b> from the crime scene, through analysis and, ultimately, to the court, (a form of audit trail) is important to establish the authenticity of evidence.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} online {{algorithm}} for generating Jakobsson's fractal hash chains. Our new algorithm compliments Jakobsson's fractal hash chain algorithm for preimage traversal since his algorithm assumes the entire hash chain is precomputed and a particular list of Ceiling(log n) hash elements or pebbles are saved. Our online algorithm for hash chain traversal incrementally generates a hash <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> n hash elements without knowledge of n before it starts. For any n, our algorithm stores only the Ceiling(log n) pebbles which are precisely the inputs for Jakobsson's amortized hash chain preimage traversal algorithm. This compact representation {{is useful to}} generate, traverse, and store a number of large digital hash chains on a small and constrained device. We also give an application using both Jakobsson's and our new algorithm applied to digital <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>custody</b> for validating dynamically changing forensics data...|$|R

An accurate record facilitates the tracking of individual pieces of evidence even if the item has been modified after the initial collection; modification can result by means of natural biological processes, like metamorphosis, or the manipulation of the insects by the lab during analysis. Accurate documentation also helps preserve the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>custody</b> for the evidence collected; it accounts for a detailed record of who has {{had access to the}} evidence, and the exact times and locations of when the evidence was moved and for what reason.

Approach: Today, email management and email authenticity must be unquestionable with strong <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>custody,</b> constant availability and tamper-proof security. A secure communication can be achieved through neural based steganography. Email is insecure. Results: This research developed an application which can check the Email content of corporate mails by S-DES algorithm along with the neural networks back propagation approach. A new filtering algorithm is also developed which can used to extract only the JPG images from the corporate emails. Experimental research shows that this algorithm is more accurate and reliable than the conventional methods. Conclusion: We anticipate that this study can also give a clear picture of the current trends in Steganography and the experimental results indicate this method is valid in steganalysis.

By August 28, the LAPD had announced that the case would be referred to prosecutors who might file criminal charges. Because the LAPD did not secure Jackson's home and allowed the Jackson family access to it too before returning to remove certain items, the department raised concerns by some observers that the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>custody</b> had been broken.

25|$|Eleven {{environmental}} organizations condemned the logging in March and later identified the withholding of international aid {{due to the}} political crisis {{as one of the}} most significant problems fueling these illegal activities. In particular, frozen funds from World Bank and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) support capacity building for the national parks, the implementation of <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>custody</b> and tracking for logging, and general funding of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MEF). In all 70% of the government's operating budget was funded by foreign aid prior to the political turmoil. Since the funding was cut, the government has been strangled by a severe lack of funds, leaving the MEF, for instance, restricted to 10% of its normal budget. Despite pleas from conservation organizations, aid agencies have stood firm on the withholding of aid, arguing that it is the only way send a clear message to the current government that their actions are illegal and disruptive to business relations as well as to pressure them into holding new elections.|$|E

To assure {{that they would be}} able to produce a funny episode, at least one member of the staff would watch the {{suggested}} films completely, generally assuring that the movie would be prime for jokes throughout; Conniff stated that he often would have to watch twenty films in their entirety before selecting one to use for the show. In one specific case, the second-season episode with the film Sidehackers, they had only skimmed the first part of the movie before making the decision to use it, and only later discovering that it contained a rape scene. They decided to stay committed to the film, but cut out the offending scene and had to explain the sudden absence of the affected character to the audience. After that point, they carefully scrutinized entire films, and once one was selected and assured the rights, committed to completing the episode with that film. Obtaining the rights was handled by the cable networks. Some licensing required buying film rights in packages, with the selected bad movies included in a catalog of otherwise good films, making the negotiations odd since the network was only interested in the bad film. Other times, the rights to the film were poorly documented, and the network would follow the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>custody</b> to locate the copyright owner as to secure broadcast rights.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the disconnect between {{the literature on}} and practice of legality verification (LV) in the forest sector and what {{would seem to be}} a logical extension into the literature on and responses to forest crime and, more specifically, transnational criminality associated with the trade in illegally logged timber. The apparently logical overlap between these two areas of endeavour arises because both are dealing with aspects <b>of</b> supply <b>chains</b> or <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>custody</b> involving raw timber, forest products or timber products more generally. The disconnect, I suggest here, arises because of a lack of ‘joined up thinking’ between the two themes that are central to forest law enforcement and governance (FLEG) [...] that is, enforcement on the one hand and governance on the other. The former is frequently perceived to be relevant mainly to issues of criminality and the development of coercive responses by the state, the latter to normative standards and rules for defining legality and implementing verification in which actors other than the state have assumed a substantial role. The second purpose of this paper, then, is to explore the role of 2 ̆ 7 agents beyond the state 2 ̆ 7 in the spaces of transnational legality verification and forest law enforcement. It does so as an initial response to the call from Biermann et al 2 ̆ 7 to document these various forms of governance through which actors exercise agency [beyond the state] and … to better understand the conditions for the emergence of agency at different levels and within different architectures...|$|R
40|$|Aim To {{describe}} {{and assess the}} scientific and technical aspects of animal forensic testing at the University of California, Davis. The findings and recommendations contained in this report are designed to assess the past, evaluate the present, and recommend reforms that will assist the animal forensic science community in providing the best possible services that comply with court standards and bear judicial scrutiny. Methods A batch of 32 closed files of domestic dog DNA cases processed at the University of California, Davis, between August 2003 and July 2005 were reviewed in this study. The case files comprised copies of all original paperwork, copies of the cover letter or final report, laboratory notes, notes on analyses, submission forms, internal <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>custody,</b> printed images and photocopies of evidence, {{as well as the}} administrative and technical reviews of those cases. Results While the fundamental aspects of animal DNA testing may be reliable and acceptable, the scientific basis for forensic testing animal DNA needs to be improved substantially. In addition to a lack of standardized and validated genetic testing protocols, improvements are needed {{in a wide range of}} topics including quality assurance and quality control measures, sample handling, evidence testing, statistical analysis, and reporting. Conclusion This review implies that although a standardized panel of short tandem repeat and mitochondrial DNA markers and publicly accessible genetic databases for canine forensic DNA analysis are already available, the persistent lack of supporting resources, including standardized quality assurance and quality control programs, still plagues the animal forensic community. This report focuses on closed cases from the period 2003 - 2005, but extends its scope more widely to include other animal DNA forensic testing services...|$|R
40|$|Faced with strict regulations, rising {{operational}} costs, depleted stocks, {{and competition}} from less expensive foreign imports, many fishers are pursuing {{new ways to}} market and sell their catch. Direct marketing arrangements can increase the ex-vessel value of seafood and profitability of operations for fishers by circumventing dominant wholesale <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>custody</b> and capturing the premium that customers {{are willing to pay}} for local seafood. Our analysis goes beyond a paradigm that understands direct marketing arrangements as solely economic tools to consider how these emerging business configurations create a set of conditions that can result in increased bonding and bridging capital among fishers by incentivizing cooperation, communication, and information production and organization. To build our case, we report on the economic value being generated for fishers in a cooperatively owned and operated direct marketing arrangement in eastern North Carolina. Over the course of 2 years, fishers participating in the Walking Fish community-supported fishery received 33 % more revenue for their catch compared to the average monthly ex-vessel price of finfish and shellfish landed in the surrounding region, and an additional 14 % to 18 % more per dollar by way of year-end profit sharing. We argue that these economic benefits create an incentive to participate, resulting in cooperation among fishers and increased communication skills that foster bonding and bridging capital that put fishers in a position to identify and respond to challenges that threaten the social-ecological resilience of the systems within which they operate. We suggest that "institutional starters" like these can play a critical role in increasing the resilience of social-ecological systems, including fisheries...|$|R

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Derived {{from the}} field of art curation, digital {{provenance}} is an unforgeable record of a digital object's <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> successive <b>custody</b> and sequence <b>of</b> operations performed on the object. It {{plays an important role in}} accessing the trustworthiness of the object, verifying its reliability and conducting audit trails of its lineage. Digital provenance forms an immutable directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure. Since history of an object cannot be changed, once a provenance chain has been created it must be protected in order to guarantee its reliability. Provenance can face attacks against the integrity of records and the confidentiality of user information, making security an important trait required for digital provenance. The digital object and its associated provenance can have different security requirements, and this makes the security of provenance different from that of traditional data. Research on digital provenance has primarily focused on provenance generation, storage and management frameworks in different fields. Security of digital provenance has also gained attention in recent years, particularly as more and more data is migrated in cloud environments which are distributed and are not under the complete control of data owners. However, there still lacks a viable secure digital provenance scheme which can provide comprehensive security for digital provenance, particularly for generic and dynamic ones. In this work, we address two important aspects of secure digital provenance that have not been investigated thoroughly in existing works: 1) capturing the DAG structure of provenance and 2) supporting dynamic information sharing. We propose a scheme that uses signature-based mutual agreements between successive users to clearly delineate the transition of responsibility of the digital object as it is passed along the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> users. In addition to preserving the properties of confidentiality, immutability and availability for a digital provenance chain, it supports the representation of DAG structures of provenance. Our scheme supports dynamic information sharing scenarios where the sequence of users who have <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> the document is not predetermined. Security analysis and empirical results indicate that our scheme improves the security of the typical secure provenance schemes with comparable performance...|$|R
