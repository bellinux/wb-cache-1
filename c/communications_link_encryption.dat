It is less known that BBC had a rapidly growing electronics division besides electrical equipment manufacturing. Guanella and other outstanding engineers positioned the company {{in the fields of}} radio transmitters, power line <b>communications,</b> microwave <b>links</b> and <b>encryption</b> techniques. In particular, Guanella is credited as one of the inventors of the Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) transmission technique. The patent filing date in Switzerland was January 29, 1942. The corresponding US Patent 2405500 Means for and method of secret signaling was granted in 1946. DSSS is of considerable importance for mobile radio up to now.|$|R

40|$|There are {{significant}} activities taking place {{to establish the}} procedures and requirements for safe and routine operation of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in the National Airspace System (NAS).
