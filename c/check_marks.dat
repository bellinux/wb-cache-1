50|$|There are {{two ways}} that Speechranks {{measures}} student participation: Points and Green <b>Check</b> <b>Marks.</b> Points are awarded to competitors based on the student’s percentile finish in each event. Students achieving the same percentile finish in any event and any tournament will be awarded {{the same number of}} Points. A student’s three best finishes in a particular event are used to sum their total Points for that event. Overall ranking on Speechranks is determined {{by the total number of}} Points a competitor has accumulated. Green <b>Check</b> <b>Marks</b> recognize consistent excellence throughout the competitive season. There is no limit to the number of Green <b>Check</b> <b>Marks</b> a student may earn. In general, Green <b>Check</b> <b>Marks</b> are awarded to any competitor who achieves a winning record in debate or finishes in the top 40% of an individual event (IE). Green <b>Check</b> <b>Marks</b> are unique to each event and students may not transfer checkmarks from one event to another. Speechranks requirements were drafted by Isaiah McPeak, with development chaired by Dr. Van Schalin and programmed by Connor McKay.
