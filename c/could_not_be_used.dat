5|$|Following the docking, Mirs {{attitude}} control system was used to spin the station, to provide spin-stabilisation {{in order to further}} conserve the fuel, as the station had descended to an altitude at which its gyroscopes <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for {{attitude control}}. The station would remain in this spin until the deorbit manoeuvres began.|$|E
5|$|This {{project would}} also enable the {{platforms}} at Herne Hill to be lengthened to accommodate 12-car trains {{as the current}} northern junction, which prevents them from being extended, would be removed.

The discoverers did not submit a claim for their findings in 2007–2011 when the Joint Working Party was reviewing claims of discoveries of new elements.|$|E
5|$|Friday, however, {{saw more}} panic on the exchange. Morgan again {{approached}} the bank presidents, {{but this time}} was only able to convince them to pledge $9.7 million. In order for this money to keep the exchange open, Morgan decided the money <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for margin sales. The volume of trading on Friday was 2/3 that of Thursday.

5|$|The {{rebuilding}} solved most of {{the maintenance}} problems whilst retaining the excellent features of the original design. Repair costs were reduced by up to 60%, and coal consumption was reduced by up to 8.4%. However the Walschaerts valve gear made the rebuilds heavier and prone to hammerblow on the track, a complaint that was not evident with the original design. The increased weight reduced their route availability, meaning that they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> on certain routes available to un-rebuilt examples, such as the line to Ilfracombe.|$|E
5|$|While {{based at}} Verdun, the Patrie was {{stranded}} on Friday, 29November 1907, at nearby Souhesmes {{due to a}} mechanical problem caused by the clothing {{of one of the}} mechanics becoming caught in the distributor drive gear. On-the-spot repairs were made but the lack of a spare magneto on board meant that the motor <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for the return flight. The decision was made not to drag the airship back to Verdun but to tether her overnight in the open at Souhesmes.|$|E
5|$|While the Australian Government offered MacArthur ICorps {{for service}} in Leyte and Luzon, nothing came of several {{proposals}} to utilise {{it in the}} liberation of these islands. The Army's prolonged period of relative inactivity during 1944 led to public concern, and many Australians believed that the AIF should be demobilised if it <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for offensive operations. This was politically embarrassing for the government, and helped motivate it to look for new areas where the military could be employed.|$|E

5|$|A further {{example of}} an {{executive}} decision invalidated by improper purpose {{can be seen from}} Congreve v. Home Office (1976). In that case, the Home Secretary, who had the power to revoke television licences, purported to revoke the licences of people who had pre-empted a rise in licence fees by buying a licence at the old rate before the date when the fees were due to go up, even though their old licences had not yet expired. The court held that this was an improper exercise of the Home Secretary's discretionary powers. His power to revoke <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to raise revenue, and therefore this power had been used for the wrong purpose.|$|E
5|$|After Lee's death, {{his wife}} Emma {{continued}} {{to operate the}} ferry for two years, in 1878 establishing an alternative ferry route below {{the confluence of the}} Paria River that allowed travelers to avoid the infamous Lee's Backbone segment. However, this route <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in the summer months due to dangerous high water levels from snowmelt. In 1879, the LDS Church bought the ferry and transferred its operation to Warren Marshall Johnson and his family. In 1896 the ferry was transferred to Jim Emett, who installed a cable across the Colorado River {{to reduce the risk of}} boats washing downstream during high water.|$|E
5|$|Although very {{conveniently}} sited for passengers, Ramsgate Harbour station presented severe operating difficulties. Its {{situation at}} the end of a steep gradient in the tunnel meant there was the constant risk that an out-of-control train would run through the station onto the beach, as happened on 3August 1891 and 24March 1915. Cramped conditions allowed no room for station growth or improvement, and the small turntable meant larger engines <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used,</b> so heavier trains needed two engines to haul them up the tunnel's gradient. Additionally, by the 1920s the population of Ramsgate had almost doubled since the station had opened, making the freight facilities inadequate, with no room for expansion.|$|E

5|$|Another {{difficulty}} encountered {{during the}} aircraft's introduction was {{the occurrence of}} surging and stalling with the Avon engines. The F.2, which used the Armstrong-Siddeley Sapphire engine, did not suffer from this issue. Further problems occurred; ejected cannon ammunition links {{had a tendency to}} strike and damage the underside of the fuselage, and diverting the gas emitted by the cannon during firing was another necessary modification. The original split-flap airbrakes caused adverse changes in pitch trim and were quickly replaced by a single ventral airbrake. This meant, however, that the airbrake <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for landings.|$|E
5|$|As {{the forward}} {{companies}} {{began to move}} back towards the main defensive position, jeeps were sent up to collect the wounded while McKinna led a force of two platoons and two tanks out to the perimeter at the Hatai junction. There {{they were able to}} reclaim the mortars that had earlier been abandoned and destroyed them so that they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> against the Australians again, but the jeeps carrying the wounded ran into a Japanese ambush in which five Australians were killed. McKinna then organised a quick counterattack, taking a force up the road along with three tanks and subsequently attacking the ambushing force, killing 11, before forming a harbour around the tanks for the night.|$|E
5|$|As the stallions of the Poitevin breed <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> {{to produce}} mules, they were {{generally}} sold as two-year-olds {{at the summer}} fair in Vendée and the winter fair in Saint-Maixent, {{as well as to}} horse merchants in Berry, Beauce, Perche and the Midi. In these areas, they were used for agriculture. In Paris, they were used for pulling omnibuses, and the French military used the Poitevin for pulling artillery. At the beginning of the 21st century there has been a new demand for mules for leisure purposes, but this demand cannot be filled by Poitevin mares until their numbers have recovered to a sufficient level.|$|E

5|$|Bell alleged in his 2003 {{lawsuit that}} the {{government}} employees had actually planted an illegal GPS tracking device in his car months before the one ostensibly allowed by the October 2000 warrant, at least as early as Bell's April 2000 release from prison. The information from that prior device <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used,</b> however, {{because there was no}} warrant allowing it to be planted. Bell also alleged that federal government employees had also illegally planted a GPS tracking transmitter in a vehicle he drove in June 1998, one which the government never disclosed. Bell further stated that his defense lawyers colluded to keep Bell from being able to demand disclosure of all such secretly planted devices.|$|E
5|$|By July 1944, Oppenheimer had {{concluded}} plutonium <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in a gun design, and opted for implosion. The accelerated effort on an implosion design, codenamed Fat Man, began in August 1944 when Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping {{reorganization of the}} Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion. Two new groups were created at Los Alamos to develop the implosion weapon, X (for explosives) Division headed by explosives expert George Kistiakowsky and G (for gadget) Division under Robert Bacher. The new design that von Neumann and T (for theoretical) Division, most notably Rudolf Peierls, had devised used explosive lenses to focus the explosion onto a spherical shape {{using a combination of}} both slow and fast high explosives.|$|E
5|$|For NTNF, the {{establishment}} brought by an organizational change. While it had previously also conducted space research, {{the operations of}} installations had been placed with FFI. As FFI was {{a branch of the}} military, this structure <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in Svalbard. Thus NTNF had to organize an operative branch for the ground station. The responsibility for operating the telecommunications facilities was awarded to the Norwegian Telecommunications Administration. The ground station needed a computer. FFI offered to deliver a Simulation for Automatic Machinery, while the alternative was to purchase a PDP-8 computer from Digital Equipment Corporation. As NTNF was responsible for the country's technological development, they chose to award the contract to FFI on the condition that they pay for a PDP-8 if they were not able to deliver a computer themselves.|$|E
