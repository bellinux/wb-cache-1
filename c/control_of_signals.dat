5000|$|Glauchau-Schönbörnchen (...) Glauchau-Schönbörnchen halt (until 1931: Schönbörnchen) {{has existed}} since 1 November 1885. There {{had been only}} a {{junction}} previously. With the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> and points now assigned to an electronic interlocking, the station, which was temporarily classified as a station (Bahnhof), has reverted to being a halt (Haltepunkt, that is it has no sets of points).|$|E
50|$|A fourth {{platform}} {{was opened}} in January 1963, on the adjacent Melbourne - Sydney standard gauge line, to enable passengers to transfer between the interstate Sydney and Adelaide expresses. In 1965, <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> at Albion station {{was transferred to}} the signal box at Sunshine. Boom barriers were provided at the nearby former Anderson Road level crossing, on the Ballarat line, in 1977.|$|E
50|$|As {{part of the}} Regional Fast Rail project, the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> was {{relocated}} to Ballarat, and the platform was extended eastwards, {{in order to increase}} the speed of trains passing through the curve, at the western end of the station. In addition, the curves over the Parwan Creek valley were realigned for higher speeds. In 2008, 160 additional car parks were opened at the station, for the use of rail commuters.|$|E
40|$|Cellular {{movement}} {{from one place}} to another is regulated by various guidance cues. The precise perception <b>of</b> these <b>signals</b> in the three-dimensional environment of a multicellular organism is remarkably complex. Recent work is now revealing that guided cell movement also requires spatial <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>signaling</b> events by endocytic dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Local {{delivery}} of TGF-b/BMP ligands {{is commonly used}} as a tissue engineering strategy for the spatial regulation of cell growth and differentiation. While the location and the dose of ligand are the only parameters that influence the spatial distribution and biological effects of the ligand in vitro, in vivo genetic studies of development reveal that spatial <b>control</b> <b>of</b> TGF-b/BMP <b>signaling</b> can be accomplished atmultiple levels, from ligand release to signal interpretation. Here we focus on spatial <b>control</b> <b>of</b> BMP <b>signaling</b> by patterned receptor expression. Motivated by our recent experimental analysis of the two-dimensional BMP signaling patterns in the developing Drosophila egg, we formulate one- and two-dimensional models of ligand diffusion and internalization {{in the presence of}} patterned receptor expression. Our analysis of these models shows that they can capture the quantitative features of the experimentally observed pattern of phosphorylated SMAD in Drosophila oogenesis and shows that patterned receptor expression provides versatile <b>control</b> <b>of</b> BMP <b>signaling</b> in developing tissues. Quantitative understanding of the mechanisms <b>of</b> spatiotemporal <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>signaling</b> pathways in development is essential for successful harnessing of these pathways in tissue engineering...|$|R

50|$|The station {{opened with}} the line, {{and was a}} signal box and block post, using the {{telegraph}} instruments by 1879, with Winters instruments provided by 1890. A six lever frame was provided in 1927, for <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals,</b> until closed as a block post in 1993. The station was renamed Riddell in 1904, {{as part of a}} policy to adopt short station names, but was renamed to the full version in October 1976.|$|E
50|$|Power {{signalling}} {{arrived in}} 1910 in Sydney Yard, with the commissioning of (Sydney) Station Box. This installation was electro-pneumatic and controlled from a miniature lever frame {{supplied by the}} McKenzie, Holland & Westinghouse Power Signal Co. of Worcester, England. Although the lines were not continuously track-circuited and absolute block telegraph remained between signalboxes, there was some <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> by track circuit and treadle. Upon its replacement by a 432 lever pistol grip power frame in the new Sydney Station West signalbox in the late 1920s, the original miniature lever frame was divided into smaller sections for reuse at other locations. The disused 'Station Box' remained in position for decades after its retirement, but has now been demolished, along with its successor.|$|E
50|$|The block {{telegraph}} instruments at Charfield {{had three}} different positions: train on line, line clear and line blocked. Not {{only was it}} {{in control of the}} station and sidings, the signal box was a block post for two sections: Berkeley Road to Charfield (up line) and Charfield to Wickwar (down line), and was in <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> for the entrance to the station and the following block sections on each line. (This was standard block working - even though the box may control a section it controlled the signals for the entrance to next section along the line.) The down line signals protected trains in both the down line of the station and Charfield to Wickwar section of the down line which followed. It was on the down line that events would occur. The block instrument could not be set to line clear until the train on the line had passed over a treadle at the next signal box and the signalman in the box had sent his consent by telegraph. The Block instruments were interlocked with the signal levers so that unless the respective instrument stood at 'line clear', they could not be cleared to accept a train. This prevented any false signals being given by mistake.|$|E

Possible “glitches” seem to be minimized but not eliminated, at which point we should consider possible security risks at hand in terms of smart security and or cyber-security policies to Dubai’s current city and grid infrastructure.|$|E

30|$|To {{the best}} of the authors’ knowledge, this article is the first to {{integrate}} preemption mechanisms into the LQF-MWM algorithm (P-LQF-MWM) to develop a TSPS capable to cope with emergencies cases, favour the crossing of EVs, and consider their specifications. Thus, this paper is the first to integrate the suggested P-LQF-MWM into a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to control efficiency disturbed traffic at a network of signalized intersections. The agents architecture provided in this paper is fully heterarchical, and no hierarchy between agents. The EVs guidance and the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> are achieved using the P-LQF-MWM and an efficient communication system between agents. The suggested system guarantees six objectives including minimizing delay time, travel time, queue occupancies, number of stops, distance traversed, and speed.|$|E
40|$|SummaryG-protein-mediated {{signaling}} {{is intrinsically}} kinetic. Signal output at steady {{state is a}} balance of the rates of GTP binding, which causes activation, and of GTP hydrolysis, which terminates activation. This GTPase catalytic cycle is regulated by receptors, which accelerate GTP binding, and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which accelerate hydrolysis. Receptors and GAPs similarly <b>control</b> the rates <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> initiation and termination. To allow independent <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> amplitude and <b>of</b> the rates <b>of</b> turning the <b>signal</b> on and off, the activities of receptors and GAPs must be coordinated. Here, the principles of such coordination and the mechanisms by which it is achieved are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Differentiated {{cells of}} the corneal {{epithelium}} are converted to hair, along with their associated stem cells, then interfollicular epidermis, {{by means of a}} multistep process triggered by dermal developmental signals. The committed basal {{cells of the}} adult corneal epithelium dedifferentiate under the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> from an associated embryonic hair-forming dermis, likely Wnts, and revert to a limbal basal cell phenotype. This initial process involves the down-regulation of Pax 6 and the loss of expression of corneal-specific keratins and the induction of basal keratinocyte markers. These dedifferentiated cells are able to reinduce dermal condensations, which in turn induce the formation of hair follicles from cells that have lost Pax 6 expression, by means of a Noggin-dependent mechanism. An epidermis is subsequently formed by cells derived from the newly segregated hair stem cells...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Noise <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> {{is a key}} {{challenge}} {{problem in}} signal enhancement, signal recognition, communication, radar, and sonar applications. The most widely used method is adaptive linear filtering method, which can adaptive change filter parameters with the stochastic property of the stationary Gaussian noise. The representative algorithms of this include least mean square (LMS) adaptive filter and recursive least squares (RLS) adaptive filter. The conventional adaptive filtering algorithms suffer from severe degradation in impulsive noise environments. Although the fractional lower-order statistics (FLOS) based adaptive methods are robust to the impulsive noise, the complexity of these algorithms is a main problem in real world implementation. In this paper, two adaptive algorithms for impulsive noise reduction are proposed. The proposed methods have the capability of steady-state {{in the presence of}} impulsive noise. Simulation results illustrate an improvement in terms of convergence and steady-state performance...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMitogen-activated {{protein kinase}} (MAPK) cascades play an {{important}} role in mediating stress responses in plants. In Arabidopsis, 20 MAPKs have been identified and classified into four major groups (A–D). Little is known about the role of group C MAPKs. We have studied the activation of Arabidopsis subgroup C 1 MAPKs (AtMPK 1 /AtMPK 2) in response to mechanical injury. An increase in their kinase activity was detected in response to wounding that was blocked by cycloheximide. Jasmonic acid (JA) activated AtMPK 1 /AtMPK 2 in the absence of wounding. Wound and JA-induction of AtMPK 1 / 2 kinase activity was not prevented in the JA-insensitive coi 1 mutant. Other stress signals, such as abscisic acid (ABA) and hydrogen peroxide, activated AtMPK 1 / 2. This report shows for the first time that regulation of AtMPK 1 / 2 kinase activity in Arabidopsis might be under the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> involved in different kinds of stress...|$|E
40|$|For {{wireless}} cellular communication systems, one seeks {{a simple}} {{effective means of}} power <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> associated with randomly dispersed users that are reusing a single channel in different cells. By effecting the lowest interference environment, in meeting a required minimum signal-to-interference ratio of p per user, channel reuse is maximized. Distributed procedures for doing this are of special interest, since the centrally administered alternative requires added infrastructure, latency, and network vulnerability. Successful distributed powering entails guiding {{the evolution of the}} transmitted power level of each of the signals, using only local measurements, so that eventually all users meet the p requirement. The local per channel power measurements include that of the intended signal as well as the undesired interference from other users (plus receiver noise). For a certain simple distributed type of algorithm, whenever power settings exist for which all users meet the p requirement, we demonstrate exponentially fast convergence to these settings...|$|E
40|$|Digital Object Identifier : 10. 1109 / 74. 868061 In {{wireless}} cellular communication, it {{is essential}} to find effective means for power <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> received from randomly dispersed users within one cell. Effective power control will heavily impact the system capacity. Distributed power control (DPC) is a natural choice for such purposes, because, unlike centralized power control, DPC does not require extensive computational power. Distributed power control should be able to adjust the power levels of each transmitted signal using only local measurements, so that, in a reasonable time, all users will maintain the desired signal-to-interference ratio. In this paper, we review different approaches for power control, focusing on CDMA systems. We also introduce state-space methods and linear quadratic power control (LQPC) to solve the power-control problem. A simulation environment was developed to compare LQPC with earlier approaches. The results show that LQPC is more effective, and is capable of computing the desired transmission power of each mobile station in fewer iterations, as well as being able to accommodate more users in the system.
