40|$|In {{this work}} we address {{the use of}} support vector machine (SVM) in the multi-class gas {{classification}} system. The objective is to classify single gases and their mixture with a semiconductor-type electronic nose. The SVM has some typical multi-class classification models; One vs. One (OVO) and One vs. All (OVA). However, studies on those models show weaknesses on calculation time, decision time and the reject region. We propose a hierarchical clustering method (HCM) based on the SVM for real-time gas <b>mixture</b> <b>classification.</b> Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed method has better performance than the typical multi-class systems based on the SVM, and that the proposed method can classify single gases and their mixture easily and fast in the embedded system compared with BP-MLP and Fuzzy ARTMAP.

Processing time and accuracy have become matters of widespread concern in using data analysis with semiconductor gas sensor array for volatile organic compound gas <b>mixture</b> <b>classification.</b> In this paper, a sensor array consisting of four nanostruc‐ tured semiconductor gas sensors was used to generate the response signal. Three main categories of gas mixtures, including single-component gas, binary-component gas mixtures, and four-component gas mixtures, are tested. To shorten the training time, extreme learning machine (ELM) is introduced to classify the category of gas mixtures and the concentration level (low, middle, and high) of formal‐ dehyde in the gas mixtures. Our results demonstrate that, compared to traditional neural networks and support vector machines (SVM), ELM networks can achieve 204 and 817 times faster training speed.

40|$|The main {{existent}} tool {{to monitor}} chemical environ- ments {{in a continuous}} mode is gas sensor arrays, which have been popularized as electronic noses (enoses). To design and validate these monitoring systems, {{it is necessary to}} make use of machine learning techniques to deal with large amounts of heterogeneous data and extract useful information from them. Therefore, enose data present several challenges for each of the steps involved in the design of a machine learning system. Some of the machine learning tasks involved in this area of research include generation of operational patterns, detection anomalies, or classification and discrimination of events. In this work, we will review some of the machine learning approaches adopted in the literature for enose data analysis, and their application to three different tasks: single gas classification under tightly-controlled operating conditions, gas binary <b>mixtures</b> <b>classification</b> in a wind tunnel with two independent gas sources, and human activity monitoring in a NASA spacecraft cabin simulator.

Appeared in Bayesian Inference and Maximum Entropy Methods, Ali Mohammad-Djafari(Ed.), AIP Proceedings ([URL] this contribution, {{we present}} new {{algorithms}} to source separation {{for the case}} of noisy instantaneous linear mixture, within the Bayesian statistical framework. The source distribution prior is modeled by a mixture of Gaussians [Moulines 97] and the mixing matrix elements distributions by a Gaussian [Djafari 99 a]. We model the mixture of Gaussians hierarchically by mean of hidden variables representing the labels of the mixture. Then, we consider the joint a posteriori distribution of sources, mixing matrix elements, labels of the mixture and other parameters of the mixture with appropriate prior probability laws to eliminate degeneracy of the likelihood function of variance parameters and we propose two iterative algorithms to estimate jointly sources, mixing matrix and hyperparameters: Joint MAP (Maximum a posteriori) algorithm and penalized EM algorithm. The illustrative example is taken in [Macchi 99] to compare with other algorithms proposed in literature.

40|$|Fusarium {{head blight}} (FHB) caused by {{infection}} with Fusarium graminearum leads to enormous losses to crop growers, and may contaminate grains {{with a number}} of Fusarium mycotoxins that pose serious risks to human and animal health. Antagonistic bacteria that are used to prevent FHB offer attractive alternatives or supplements to synthetic fungicides for controlling FHB without the negative effects of chemical management. Out of 500 bacterial strains isolated from soil, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens JCK- 12 showed strong antifungal activity and was considered a potential source for control strategies to reduce FHB. B. amyloliquefaciens JCK- 12 produces several cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs) including iturin A, fengycin, and surfactin. Iturin A inhibits spore germination of F. graminearum. Fengycin or surfactin alone did not display any inhibitory activity against spore germination at concentrations less than 30 μg/ml, but a mixture of iturin A, fengycin, and surfactin showed a remarkable synergistic inhibitory effect on F. graminearum spore germination. The fermentation broth and formulation of B. amyloliquefaciens JCK- 12 strain reduced the disease incidence of FHB in wheat. Furthermore, co-application of B. amyloliquefaciens JCK- 12 and chemical fungicides resulted in synergistic in vitro antifungal effects and significant disease control efficacy against FHB under greenhouse and field conditions, suggesting that B. amyloliquefaciens JCK- 12 has a strong chemosensitizing effect. The synergistic antifungal effect of B. amyloliquefaciens JCK- 12 and chemical fungicides in combination may result from the cell wall damage and altered cell membrane permeability in the phytopathogenic fungi caused by the <b>CLP</b> <b>mixtures</b> and subsequent increased sensitivity of F. graminearum to fungicides. In addition, B. amyloliquefaciens JCK- 12 showed the potential to reduce trichothecenes mycotoxin production. The results {{of this study indicate that}} B. amyloliquefaciens JCK- 12 could be used as an available biocontrol agent or as a chemosensitizer to chemical fungicides for controlling FHB disease and as a strategy for preventing the contamination of harvested crops with mycotoxins...|$|R

40|$|Elastic {{scattering}} spectroscopy (ESS), is a non-invasive and real-time in vivo optical diagnosis technique {{sensitive to}} changes in the physical properties of human tissue, and thus able to detect early cancer and precancerous changes. This thesis focuses on the statistical issue on how to eliminate irrelevant variations in the high-dimensional ESS spectra and extract the most useful information to enable the classification of tissue as normal or abnormal. Multivariate statistical methods have been used to tackle the problems, among which principal component discriminant analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis are the most explored throughout the thesis as general tools for supervised dimension reduction and classification. Customized multivariate methods are proposed in the specific context of ESS. When ESS spectra are measured in vivo by a hand-held optical probe, differences in the angle and pressure of the probe are a major source of variability between the spectra from replicate measurements. A customized spectral pre-treatment called error removal by orthogonal subtraction (EROS) is designed to ameliorate the effect of this variability. This pre-treatment reduces the complexity and increases both the accuracy and interpretability of the subsequent classification models when applied to early detection of cancer risk in Barrett’s oesophagus. For the application of ESS to diagnosis of sentinel lymph node metastases in breast cancer, an automated ESS scanner was developed to take measurements from a larger area of tissue to produce ESS images for cancer diagnosis. Problems arise due to the existence of background area in the image with considerable between-node variation and no training data available. A partially supervised Bayesian multivariate finite <b>mixture</b> <b>classification</b> model with a Markov random field spatial prior in a reduced dimensional space is proposed to recognise the background area automatically {{at the same time as}} distinguishing normal from metastatic tissue. ...|$|R

40|$|The EM and K-Means {{algorithms}} am two popular search {{techniques that}} converge {{to a local}} minimum of their respective loss functions. The EM algorithm uses partial assignment of instances while the K-Means algorithm uses exclusive assignment.

We show that the ERA algorithm can obtain better maximum likelihood estimates on three real world data sets. On an artificial data set, we show that the ERA algorithm can produce parameter estimates that {{are more likely to}} be closer to the generating mechanism. To illustrate the practical benefits of the ERA algorithm we test its ability in a classification context.
