5|$|Neon is {{the first}} p-block noble gas, and the first element with a true octet of electrons. It is inert: {{as is the case}} with its lighter analogue, helium, no {{strongly}} bound neutral molecules containing neon have been identified. The ions +, +, and + have been observed from optical and mass spectrometric studies. Solid neon <b>clathrate</b> hydrate was produced from water ice and neon gas at pressures 0.35–0.48 GPa and temperatures ca. –30°C. Ne atoms are not bonded to water and can freely move through this material. They can be extracted by placing the <b>clathrate</b> into a vacuum chamber for several days, yielding ice XVI, the least dense crystalline form of water.|$|E
5|$|Under high {{pressures}} helium {{can form}} compounds with various other elements. Helium-nitrogen <b>clathrate</b> (He(N2)11) crystals have been grown {{at room temperature}} at pressures ca. 10 GPa in a diamond anvil cell. The insulating electride Na2He {{has been shown to}} be thermodynamically stable at pressures above 113 GPa. It has a fluorite structure.|$|E
5000|$|In {{some regions}} (e.g., Gulf of Mexico) methane in <b>clathrates</b> {{may be at}} least {{partially}} derived from thermal degradation of organic matter, dominantly in petroleum. The methane in <b>clathrates</b> typically has a biogenic isotopic signature and highly variable δ13C (−40 to −100‰), with an approximate average of about −65‰ [...] Below the zone of solid <b>clathrates,</b> large volumes of methane may form bubbles of free gas in the sediments.|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} microscopic {{observations and}} a statistical {{study of the}} number, size and shape distribution of <b>clathrates</b> in the GRIP (Greenland Ice Core Project) deep ice core, using 185 samples from a depth range of 1016 - 3014 m, spanning a period of 6 to > 110 ka sp and encompassing the Holocene, Wisconsin and Eemian periods. The number concentration of the <b>clathrates</b> varied considerably with climatic changes. It was possible to detect the rapid climatic oscillations in the last glacial between 13 and 110 ka BP, the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, in the number-concentration profile of <b>clathrates.</b> The mean volume of <b>clathrates</b> is less clearly influenced by climatic factors, with a tendency towards greater volumes in warmer periods, but also a growth of <b>clathrates</b> with depth could be detected. This growth rate was calculated to be 3. 1 x 10 (- 12) cm(3) a(- 1). The amount of gases captured in the <b>clathrates</b> {{is estimated to be}} significantly smaller than the total amount of air determined by gas-concentration measurements. This points to diffusion processes of atmospheric gases within the ice matrix...|$|R
40|$|<b>Clathrates</b> {{represent}} {{a family of}} inorganic materials called cage compounds. The key feature of their crystal structures is a three-dimensional (host) framework bearing large cavities (cages) with 20 - 28 vertices. These polyhedral cages bear-as a rule-guest species. Depending on the formal charge of the framework, <b>clathrates</b> are grouped in anionic, cationic and neutral. While the bonding in the framework is of (polar) covalent nature, the guest-host interaction can be ionic, covalent or even van-der Waals, depending on the chemical composition of the <b>clathrates.</b> The chemical composition and structural features of the cationic <b>clathrates</b> can be described by the enhanced Zintl concept, whereas {{the composition of the}} anionic <b>clathrates</b> deviates often from the Zintl counts, indicating additional atomic interactions in comparison with the ionic-covalent Zintl model. These interactions can be visualized and studied by applying modern quantum chemical approaches such as electron localizability...|$|R
5|$|Ariel {{is thought}} to have formed from an {{accretion}} disc or subnebula; a disc of gas and dust that either existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or was created by the giant impact that most likely gave Uranus its large obliquity. The precise composition of the subnebula is not known; however, the higher density of Uranian moons compared to the moons of Saturn indicates that it may have been relatively water-poor. Significant amounts of carbon and nitrogen may have been present in the form of carbon monoxide (CO) and molecular nitrogen (N2), instead of methane and ammonia. The moons that formed in such a subnebula would contain less water ice (with CO and N2 trapped as <b>clathrate)</b> and more rock, explaining the higher density.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the compounds where a noble gas atom {{is involved in a}} covalent bond, noble gases also form non-covalent compounds. The clathrates, first described in 1949, consist of a noble gas atom trapped within cavities of crystal lattices of certain organic and inorganic substances. The essential condition for their formation is that the guest (noble gas) atoms must be of appropriate size to fit in the cavities of the host crystal lattice. For instance, argon, krypton, and xenon form clathrates with hydroquinone, but helium and neon do not because they are too small or insufficiently polarizable to be retained. Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon also form <b>clathrate</b> hydrates, where the noble gas is trapped in ice.|$|E
5|$|Oberon {{is thought}} to have formed from an {{accretion}} disc or subnebula: a disc of gas and dust that either existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or was created by the giant impact that most likely gave Uranus its large obliquity. The precise composition of the subnebula is not known; however, the relatively high density of Oberon and other Uranian moons compared to the moons of Saturn indicates that it may have been relatively water-poor. Significant amounts of carbon and nitrogen may have been present in the form of carbon monoxide and N2 instead of methane and ammonia. The moons that formed in such a subnebula would contain less water ice (with CO and N2 trapped as <b>clathrate)</b> and more rock, explaining the higher density.|$|E
50|$|These modern {{estimates}} are notably {{smaller than the}} 10,000 to 11,000 Gt C (2 m³) proposed by previous researchers {{as a reason to}} consider <b>clathrates</b> to be a geo-organic fuel resource (MacDonald 1990, Kvenvolden 1998). Lower abundances of <b>clathrates</b> do not rule out their economic potential, but a lower total volume and apparently low concentration at most sites does suggest that only a limited percentage of <b>clathrates</b> deposits may provide an economically viable resource.|$|R
5000|$|Many <b>clathrates</b> {{are derived}} from organic hydrogen-bonded {{frameworks}}. These frameworks are prepared from molecules that [...] "self-associate" [...] by multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions. The most famous <b>clathrates</b> are methane <b>clathrates</b> where the hydrogen-bonded framework is contributed by water and the guest molecules are methane. Large amounts of methane naturally frozen in this form exist both in permafrost formations and under the ocean sea-bed. Other hydrogen-bonded networks {{are derived from}} hydroquinone, urea, and thiourea. A much studied host molecule is Dianin's compound. Hofmann compounds are coordination polymers with the formula Ni(CN)4Ni(NH3)2. These materials crystallize with small aromatic guests (benzene, certain xylenes), and this selectivity has been exploited commercially for the separation of these hydrocarbons. [...] Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) form <b>clathrates.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{review the}} {{reservoirs}} of methane <b>clathrates</b> that may {{exist in the}} different bodies of the Solar System. Methane was formed in the interstellar medium prior to having been embedded in the protosolar nebula gas phase. This molecule was subsequently trapped in <b>clathrates</b> that formed from crystalline water ice during the cooling of the disk and incorporated in this form in {{the building blocks of}} comets, icy bodies, and giant planets. Methane <b>clathrates</b> may {{play an important role in}} the evolution of planetary atmospheres. On Earth, the production of methane in <b>clathrates</b> is essentially biological, and these compounds are mostly found in permafrost regions or in the sediments of continental shelves. On Mars, methane would more likely derive from hydrothermal reactions with olivine-rich material. If they do exist, martian methane <b>clathrates</b> would be stable only at depth in the cryosphere and sporadically release some methane into the atmosphere via mechanisms that remain to be determined...|$|R
5|$|Ariel is {{the fourth}} largest of the Uranian moons, and may have the third {{greatest}} mass. The moon's density is 1.66g/cm3, which indicates that it consists of roughly equal parts water ice and a dense non-ice component. The latter could consist of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds known as tholins. The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of}} the moon. Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Ariel's leading hemisphere than on its trailing hemisphere. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to bombardment by charged particles from Uranus's magnetosphere, which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation). The energetic particles tend to sputter water ice, decompose methane trapped in ice as <b>clathrate</b> hydrate and darken other organics, leaving a dark, carbon-rich residue behind.|$|E
5|$|An ice core is a {{vertical}} column through a glacier, sampling the layers that formed through an annual cycle of snowfall and melt. As snow accumulates, each layer presses on lower layers, making them denser until they turn into firn. Firn is not dense {{enough to prevent}} air from escaping; but at a density of about 830kg/m3 it turns to ice, and the air within is sealed into bubbles that capture {{the composition of the}} atmosphere at the time the ice formed. The depth at which this occurs varies with location, but in Greenland and the Antarctic it ranges from 64m to 115m. Because the rate of snowfall varies from site to site, the age of the firn when it turns to ice varies a great deal. At Summit Camp in Greenland, the depth is 77 m and the ice is 230 years old; at Dome C in Antarctica the depth is 95 m and the age 2500 years. As further layers build up, the pressure increases, and at about 1500m the crystal structure of the ice changes from hexagonal to cubic, allowing air molecules to move into the cubic crystals and form a <b>clathrate.</b> The bubbles disappear and the ice becomes more transparent.|$|E
5|$|Titania is {{the largest}} and most massive Uranian moon, and the eighth most massive moon in the Solar System. Its density of 1.71 g/cm³, which is much higher than the typical density of Saturn's satellites, {{indicates}} that it consists of roughly equal proportions of water ice and dense non-ice components; the latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds. The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations made in 2001–2005, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of the}} moon. Water ice absorption bands are slightly stronger on Titania's leading hemisphere than on the trailing hemisphere. This is the opposite of what is observed on Oberon, where the trailing hemisphere exhibits stronger water ice signatures. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to the bombardment by charged particles from the magnetosphere of Uranus, which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation). The energetic particles tend to sputter water ice, decompose methane trapped in ice as <b>clathrate</b> hydrate and darken other organics, leaving a dark, carbon-rich residue behind.|$|E
40|$|Raman spectroscopic {{measurements}} on synthetic air <b>clathrates,</b> prepared at different pressures and temperatures, are presented. The gas fractionation for <b>clathrates</b> formed at - 2 and - 20 degrees C is determined from the integrated vibron mode intensities of nitrogen and oxygen molecules. An increasing fractionation {{in favour of}} oxygen with increasing pressure is found. An asymmetric peak shape for the O- 2 vibron mode was observed in air <b>clathrates</b> prepared at 300 bar and - 2 degrees C. The asymmetry of the N- 2 vibron mode in the same sample is much less pronounced...|$|R
50|$|Another kind of {{exception}} is in <b>clathrates</b> {{associated with the}} Arctic ocean, where <b>clathrates</b> can exist in shallower water stabilized by lower temperatures rather than higher pressures; these may potentially be marginally stable {{much closer to the}} surface of the sea-bed, stabilized by a frozen 'lid' of permafrost preventing methane escape.|$|R
50|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that the Eocene hothouse world was caused by runaway global warming from released methane <b>clathrates</b> deep in the oceans.

Although this cannot be commercially exploited at the present time, the amount of combustible energy of the known methane <b>clathrate</b> fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together.

25|$|<b>Clathrates</b> are {{composites}} {{in which}} a lattice of one substance forms a cage around another.

40|$|We {{present an}} ab initio {{study of the}} {{structural}} and electronic properties of type-I and type-II silicon <b>clathrates</b> doped by elements chosen to be more electronegative than silicon. Depending on the intercalated element, we show that the electronic properties of doped silicon <b>clathrates</b> can exhibit metallic, semiconducting, or insulating behavior. It is found in particular that doping can lead to silicon-based materials with a band gap in the visible range and that, in type-II <b>clathrates,</b> the gap can be direct.

The <b>clathrate</b> gun runaway effect may be used to describe more rapid methane releases.

40|$|One of the {{key points}} for {{applying}} thermoelectric technology into producing renewable energy is a thermoelectric material which possesses excellent thermoelectric figure-of-merit. The figure-of-merit of thermoelectric materials is derived from thermoelectric power, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity. The <b>clathrates</b> have normally a very low value of thermal conductivity due to their complicated structures and the accompanying rattler effect. In recent years, the <b>clathrates</b> mainly composed of BaGaGe {{were found to have}} excellent thermoelectric properties. However, due to the high cost of making a single crystal, a power process will be used in this project to prepare the BaGaGe <b>clathrates.</b> In this three-year project, to develop a powder process which can produce BaGaGe <b>clathrates</b> with stable thermoelectric properties will be the aim at the first year. The BaGaGe <b>clathrates</b> process procedure in this project includes melting, pulverizing and hot pressing. Property variations accompanying deviations in composition and structure which are caused by each step will be evaluated. Besides the thermoelectric properties, the mechanical and thermal properties of bulk will be measured. The aim at the second year is the improvement of properties of BaGaGe <b>clathrates.</b> Both approaches, reducing grain size and introducing dilute B element, will be attempted. Increasing material strength and, meanwhile, no bad influence on thermoelectric properties are expected through these approaches. The aim at the third year is trying to prepare barrier layers suitable for BaGaGe thermoelectric materials. Two kinds of barrier layers will be developed. One lies between substrate and electrode as anti-diffusion layer preventing reactions between electrode metal and BaGaGe elements. Another covers substrate surface for preventing the loss of volatile elements via vaporization. 具有良好熱電優值的熱電材料是要將熱電技術普遍用於製造再生能源的關鍵所在。熱電材料的熱電優值由熱電勢、電導率與熱導率所共同決定。晶籠化合物由於有複雜結晶結構，且伴隨振子效應，因此具有非常低的熱導率。近年來，以鋇鎵鍺做為主要成分的晶籠化合物被發現具備優異熱電特性。然而，由於單晶製程成本較高，本計畫中將以粉末製程來製備鋇鎵鍺晶籠化合物。本三年期計畫第一年將以開發可製備出具穩定熱電性質之鋇鎵鍺晶籠化合物的粉末製程為目標。在本計畫中，製作程序包含熔煉、製粉、熱壓等步驟。各個步驟所產生的成分與結構誤差導致的性質變異將加以評估。除熱電相關特性外，塊材的機械與熱性質將一併量測。第二年的目標則是鋇鎵鍺晶籠化合物特性的提升。計畫將嘗試降低材料晶粒尺寸與添加微量硼元素兩方法。一方面期待藉由這兩方法，可提高材料強度；另一方面亦希望這些方法對熱電相關性質不會有不良影響。第三年的目標則是嘗試製備出適用於鋇鎵鍺熱電材料之阻障層。本計畫將開發兩類阻障層，一位於基材與電極間，做為抗擴散層，防止電極金屬與基材鋇鎵鍺元素反應。第二類是覆蓋於基材表面。由於鎵元素在高熱容易揮發，此類阻障層是被用來防止元素散失...|$|R
