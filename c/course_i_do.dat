2500|$|On September 15, 1999 at 9:50p.m., Minsky {{was arrested}} at Tampa International Airport by airport police officers. Minsky {{attempted}} to scam another woman the previous day by asking her to bring $5,000 to the airport. His bail was set at $1 million and he was extradited to California. During an interview with America's Most Wanted, Minsky, {{when asked if he}} had any remorse for his crimes, stated, [...] "Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> now that I'm caught, but what am I supposed to do; I'm a parolee. Work for $10 an hour?" [...] At Minsky's trial the segment containing his statement was played for the jury, sealing his fate.|$|E
2500|$|The best form {{of civilization}} {{in respect to}} the {{improvement}} of the race, would be one in which society was not costly; where incomes were chiefly derived from professional sources, and not much through inheritance; where every lad had a chance of showing his abilities, and, if highly gifted, was enabled to achieve a first-class education and entrance into professional life, by the liberal help of the exhibitions and scholarships which he had gained in his early youth; where marriage was held in as high honour as in ancient Jewish times; where the pride of race was encouraged (of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not refer to the nonsensical sentiment of the present day, that goes under that name); where the weak could find a welcome and a refuge in celibate monasteries or sisterhoods, and lastly, where the better sort of emigrants and refugees from other lands were invited and welcomed, and their descendants naturalised.

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1862, Henry Whitney Bellows, {{president}} of the U.S. Sanitary Commission, wrote the following to Colonel Hoffman after visiting the camp: [...] "Sir, the amount of standing water, unpoliced grounds, of foul sinks, of unventilated and crowded barracks, of general disorder, of soil reeking miasmatic accretions, of rotten bones and emptying of camp kettles, is enough to drive a sanitarian to despair. I hope that no thought will be entertained of mending matters. The absolute abandonment of the spot {{seems to be the}} only judicious <b>course.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not believe that any amount of drainage would purge that soil loaded with accumulated filth or those barracks fetid with two stories of vermin and animal exhalations. Nothing but fire can cleanse them."Hoffman already had requested improvements in the camp, but he kept the report secret because {{he did not want to}} take a position contrary to that taken by any superior, such as Quartermaster General Meigs. Not only prisoners suffered. One of Colonel Tucker's sons, who served with him at the camp, became ill and died in {{the summer of}} 1862.|$|E

60|$|Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> will <b>do</b> it, and of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> will <b>do</b> it for {{the love}} of you and Procter. You can give me my brief, and we can speak about its details. Once again, of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> will <b>do</b> it, and with all my heart.|$|R
60|$|MRS. JONES. He did {{n't look}} quite himself. Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> n't take notice.|$|R
60|$|Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not wish}} to be sick: only it looks such {{beautiful}} weather.|$|E
60|$|LADY. Well, of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> But what I mean is {{a certain}} strong {{simplicity}} about you.|$|E
60|$|MRS WHITEFIELD. Why, of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> What queer {{things you}} say, Jack! We can't help loving our own blood relations.|$|E
60|$|HARRY. Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> When <b>I</b> {{heard someone}} {{shouting}} in English {{the first thing}} I thought of was George.|$|R
6000|$|But for {{the moment}} Wendy was shocked. [...] "You conceit [braggart]," [...] she exclaimed, with frightful sarcasm; [...] "of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> nothing!" ...|$|R
60|$|THE GENERAL [impatiently] Oh, of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> {{mean that}} you used those words. But that was the meaning {{and the spirit of}} it.|$|R
60|$|MRS. ERLYNNE. [Laughing.] Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> You'll {{carry it}} so gracefully. You would carry off {{anything}} gracefully, dear Lord Augustus.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well now, of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> It's terrible lonesome downstairs without you. Just go {{and smooth}} things over--that's a good girl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ob <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> Geo'giana, but as your life--an' p'r'aps mine, but dat ain't much--depends on it, you'll see de needcessity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> knocked two of {{them down}} and another fellow had two of his teeth broken. But I couldn't fight all six single handed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> and him too. Why did {{you come}} so mysteriously, and, I must say, unbecomingly? I am afraid <b>I</b> <b>did</b> wrong in not informing you of my intention.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{spoke of}} a lot of things which, of <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not understand," [...] he said. [...] "For instance, there was Ulric. Who was he?" ...|$|R
60|$|HORNBLOWER. Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> I told ye I {{was a bad}} man to be up against. Perhaps ye'll {{believe me}} now.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> You know I {{was present}} {{when you talked}} the matter over with that fellow--what's-'is-name--that gave you his report." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never said}} a word about her not meeting him. Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not wish that any meeting should be {{contrived}} between them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, of <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} her name, {{and she is}} not very large; but I brought her down the shoot with such {{violence}} that--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>did!</b> All {{the boats}} laid here after {{the fight in}} St. Leonard's bay, an' it was only {{yesterday}} they scooted up the river!" ...|$|R

6000|$|VOICE. (Mockingly.) Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> Who {{does not}} know {{the man who was}} so cruel to his wife--almost the only one he ever had? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> {{really and}} truly; {{and if it}} is to come to pass, it is time to take measures. Don't you see, Margaret?" ...|$|E
60|$|FRANK. Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> Ever so much better. Vivvums mustn't lecture: {{her little}} boy's incorrigible. [He {{attempts}} {{to take her}} face caressingly in his hands].|$|E
6000|$|... "Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> Have <b>I</b> {{not always}} proved myself a {{trustworthy}} messenger? I told the man, in my best Norse, {{to have two}} `Kos' killed without delay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But how did he--how is it he {{went out}} to fight, Doctor? I could hardly believe it when I was told, though of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not say so." ...|$|R
60|$|After the {{conversation}} which I have quoted about Barrymore, Sir Henry {{put on his}} hat and prepared to go out. As a matter of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> the same.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> darling. But it'll {{never be}} proved against HIM, {{you may be}} sure. I saw it at a glance. It's Mr. Gilbert Gildersleeve." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> mother, and I {{see what}} you mean now. Certainly I will change my things in future. You don't mind, do you, Bill?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I don't--but for Manfredi's sake, of <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> But for his sake {{more than}} my own, I admit. And I think he knows it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} what to say, but I had to say {{something}}, and, moreover, that something must not be wholly inconsistent with my explanation to Mary.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> and {{was sorry}} enough, but I {{could not help}} it. I knew you would be annoyed. But you and Bertie managed it badly between you." ...|$|R
60|$|Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not read. How could <b>I?</b> Nor <b>did</b> <b>I</b> sleep. My mind ran on, and on, and {{not until}} the steward brought my coffee, shortly before five, <b>did</b> <b>I</b> sink into my first doze.|$|R
