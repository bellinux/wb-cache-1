5000|$|There is {{a longstanding}} {{controversy}} about the term's true meaning. In this controversy, the term hacker is reclaimed by computer programmers {{who argue that}} it refers simply to someone with an advanced understanding of computers and computer networks,and that cracker is the more appropriate term for those who break into computers, whether <b>computer</b> <b>criminal</b> (black hats) or computer security expert (white hats).

5000|$|The CEH {{certification}} {{had drawn}} criticism shortly after inception due to {{higher than average}} preparation costs, low-tech exam registration procedures, and limited technical content within the exam itself. As the CEH program has matured, such complaints have been largely addressed by EC Council via changes to certification requirements, exam registration process, and exam content itself.Some computer security professionals have objected to the term [...] "ethical hacker" [...] as a [...] "contradiction in terms". Part of the controversy may arise from the older, less stigmatized, definition of hacker, which has since become synonymous with the <b>computer</b> <b>criminal.</b> According to the EC-Council, {{there has been an}} increase of careers where CEH and other ethical hacking certifications are preferred or required. The US government accepts this association and requires CEH accreditation for some jobs, per DoD 8570.01-M guidelines.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the problems in}} policing computer crime in terms of: (i) the absence of reliable statistics on computer crime due to difficulties over defining computer crime and the background and motivation of those providing information and statistics on incidents of computer crime: (ii) the attitudes of police to <b>computer</b> <b>criminals,</b> how <b>computer</b> <b>criminals</b> are treated by {{the courts and the}} culpability of victim organisations: and (iii) the adequacy of the training of police officers to deal with technological crime. As a solution, the paper outlines a forensic methodology for dealing with computer crime. The approach covers: the investigation of a computer crime: the legal aspects of computer crime in terms of possible offences and the rules of evidence; the skills and equipment needed to present computer crime evidence in court; and the appropriate computing skills. The conclusion reached is that computer crime will only be combatted successfully if adequate resources are committed to the problem and the police develop or have access to relevant expertise.

40|$|Abstract — “Ethical Hacking ” which {{attempts}} to pro-actively increase security protection by identifying and patching known security vulnerabilities on systems owned by other parties. Ethical hackers may beta test unreleased software, stress test released software, and scan networks of computers for vulnerabilities. Ethical hacking {{can be defined}} as the practice of hacking without no malicious intention, rather evaluate target system with a hackers perspectives. [1][7] Hacking is a process to bypass the security mechanisms of an information system or network. In common usage, hacker is a generic term for a <b>computer</b> <b>criminal.</b> Hacking is an unprivileged usage of computer and network resources. The term "hacker " originally meant a very gifted programmer. In recent years though, with easier access to multiple systems, it now has negative implications...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{has taken}} an {{in-depth}} look into bank computer security, the bank security officer, and "The 1968 Bank Protection Act. "To accomplish this, a questionnaire was developed and furnished to all bank members of the Indiana Bankers Association to be responded to by the bank security officers. This document {{was based on the}} premise that this bank officer is ill-trained, overworked by unrelated duties, and generally not interested in security. "The 1968 Bank Protection Act" made this officer's position a legal requirement to maintain its banking operation and charged this officer with certain duties. The resultant responses verified the original hypothesis and showed a need for future training. This thesis shows the profile of, a <b>computer</b> <b>criminal</b> and also some cases to illustrate the type and scope of criminal ventures related to bank computer facilities. This was all coupled with an analysis of the law as it applies and offers a training vehicle to bring this officer up to a level of competency in this field.

40|$|As {{the trend}} of the usage of third party Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and open source {{software}} continuously increases [2], COTS security {{has become a major}} concern for many organizations whose daily business extensively relies upon a healthy IT infrastructure. But, according to the 2006 CSI/FBI <b>computer</b> <b>criminal</b> survey, 47 % of the surveyed organizations only spent no more than 2 % of the IT budget in security. Often, competing with limited IT resources and the fast changing internet threats, the ability to prioritize security vulnerabilities and address them efficiently has become a critical success factor for every security manager. As known, the security impacts of vulnerabilities can be specified in terms of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA). These attributes can have very different business indications in different context. Unfortunately, most current leading vulnerability rating systems by CERT, Microsoft, NIST, and Symantec are value neutral, static, and treat CIA equally. To date, it is still very difficult to prioritize security vulnerability efficiently with quantitative evidence because of lack of effective metrics and historical data, and the complex and sensitive nature of security [4]. We propose to (1) establish a framework, namely the Threat Modeling method based on Attacking Path Analysis (T-MAP), which is sensitive to stakeholder value propositions to dynamically prioritize COTS vulnerability and model security threat; (2) grow a comprehensive COTS vulnerability database that supports T-MAP; (3) automate T-MAP with a XML framework that abstracts the process...|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{computer}} crime, law enforcement agencies and investigators have been required to break new ground. Traditional investigation methods did not provide a comprehensive solution for combating computer crime, with the problem posed by hacking proving particularly difficult. This thesis considers the potential of adapting the long-established technique of criminal profiling to the new context of computer crime. Such methods are primarily used against violent crime, and build upon the perpetrator's signature behaviour. As different sources provide a good overview of the possible techniques and methods used to hack computer systems, it seems that a diversity of methods exist from which profile categories may be derived. It can also be assumed that computer crime provides the possibility for establishing signature behaviour as well. Thus the thesis examines the existing methods of criminal profiling, and the additional possibilities of applying them for computer crime are closely examined. The development of a case study, focusing upon hacking incidents in Germany, is outlined {{in order to test}} the aforementioned assumptions. For the development of a Criminal Profile possible behavioural aspects of hackers and their motives are considered. For the verification cases of German hacking incidents have been studied to find commonalities and differences for motives, as well as the Modus Operandi (MO). As results the thesis indicates that hacking methods which have akeady been used years ago are still dominant amongst the preferred methods today. In ten out of twelve cases analysed, the observed characteristics fit within in the stereotype of a Script Kiddie. Only two hackers had motives that departed from this categorisation, but a significant difference regarding their methods - the MO - could not be noticed. From the twelve cases under investigation a basic principle could be identified: The hackers take the path of the least effort. This reveals a clue for the fact that a different motive does not necessarily lead to different methods. As a consequence of the research and case study analysis, a number of insights have been gained that provide material for ongoing studies within the field of <b>computer</b> <b>criminal</b> profiling.

40|$|Health {{information}} systems contain information about one 2 ̆ 7 s health status, history of disease, living conditions and personal {{information such as}} social security number and address. The sensitivity of the health information contributes to the significance of ensuring {{the security of the}} health {{information systems}}. As more health information is stored, processed and transmitted using information systems, information security breaches have also risen. Risk assessment is a process that quantitatively or qualitatively assesses the adverse impact that a system may suffer {{in the case of an}} information security breach. The results of risk assessment provide the system owner with existing security issues as well as adequate controls. ^ This study applies the risk assessment model proposed by National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800 - 30 (NIST SP 800 - 30) to the health information systems at the virtual tissue bank of the Susan G.
