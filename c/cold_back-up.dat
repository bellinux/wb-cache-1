40|$|The {{effect of}} {{multi-step}} tempering on retained austenite content and mechanical properties of {{low alloy steel}} used in the forged <b>cold</b> <b>back-up</b> roll was investigated. Microstructural evolutions were characterized by optical microscope, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope and Feritscope, while the mechanical properties were determined by hardness and tensile tests. The results revealed that the content of retained austenite decreased by about 2 % after multi-step tempering. However, the content of retained austenite increased from 3. 6 % to 5. 1 % by increasing multi-step tempering temperature. The hardness and tensile strength increased as the austenitization temperature changed from 800 to 920 째C, while above 920 째C, hardness and tensile strength decreased. In addition, the maximum values of hardness, ultimate and yield strength were obtained via triple tempering at 520 째C, while beyond 520 째C, the hardness, ultimate and yield strength decreased sharply...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} {{of renewable energy}} technologies is a critical tool for reducing climate change and the reliance on fossil fuels. However, renewable energy technologies cannot be considered totally clean because they require energy consumption and have environmental impacts that cannot be neglected during their life cycle. In this paper, the life cycle assessment methodology was applied to assess resource use and other environmental burdens related to the entire life-cycle steps of a solar cooling plant. The investigated system works with an absorption chiller assisted by a solar plant. Two back-up configurations (hot back-up and <b>cold</b> <b>back-up)</b> were examined in two localities: Palermo (southern Italy) and Zurich (Switzerland). The benefits in terms of primary energy savings and greenhouse gases emission reduction were demonstrated by comparing {{the use of this}} innovative plant in substitution of a conventional one. Energy and CO 2 eq emission payback times and the energy return ratio of the system were calculated. For all the analysed configurations they ranged from 4 to 6 years. A sensitivity analysis related to the calculation of the energy payback time was carried out to assess the influence of various system performance parameters on the payback index. The analysis stressed the following:. -LCA of renewable energy technologies has to include a detailed analysis of the use phase to assess the benefits that arise from the energy produced by the system during its useful life and to obtain reliable and high-quality LCA results. -The use phase is responsible of about 70 - 90 % of the energetic and environmental impacts of the plant life cycle. -The innovative plant has a lower environmental impact than the conventional plant. -The advantages of renewable energy technologies strongly depend on the climate of the installation site...|$|E
5000|$|The 2008 {{campaign}} got rocky {{when the}} Blades {{shipped off to}} Cornwall, Ontario for the Royal Bank Cup. Star goaltender Scott Greenham could not attend the tournament despite leading the Blades to the OPJHL and Central Canadian Championships. Having accepted a scholarship {{to play for the}} Alaska Nanooks, he would lose his NCAA eligibility if he played in the Royal Bank Cup because his age (21). [...] With this, the Blades had to bring their <b>back-up</b> <b>cold</b> off the bench for the National Championship. In {{the first game of the}} tournament, Oakville had to play the host Cornwall Colts of the Central Junior A Hockey League. Despite outshooting them, the Blades were shocked by the Colts 5-4. The next night, the Blades drew the Weeks Crushers of the Maritime Junior A Hockey League. The Blades badly outshot the Crushers, but the Crushers managed to squeak out a 4-3 overtime victory of the Central Canadian champions. In a nail-biting and high scoring outing, the Blades gave Humboldt a 7-6 loss to keep contention for a playoff spot in the tournament. It was not to be though, as the Blades out-shot but still lost to the top ranked Camrose Kodiaks 6-1.|$|R
