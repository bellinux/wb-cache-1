6000|$|We rode on, crossed Market Street, and {{a little}} later were passing through the working-class district. Here the streets were not deserted. Leaning over the gates or {{standing}} in groups were the I.L.W. men. Happy, well-fed children were playing games, and stout housewives sat {{on the front steps}} gossiping. One and all cast amused glances at us. Little children ran after us, crying: [...] "Hey, mister, ain't you hungry?" [...] And one woman, nursing a child at her breast, called to Dakon: [...] "Say, Fatty, I'll give you a meal for your skate--ham and potatoes, currant jelly, white bread, <b>canned</b> <b>butter,</b> and two cups of coffee." ...|$|E
50|$|Dairy {{processing}} {{has been}} a notable industry in Morrinsville, most notably through the Morrinsville Dairy Company since 1922. The dairy company retained the Scottish link through prominently using the name Lockerbie. Today, {{after a series of}} mergers, the dairy factory is now operated by the Fonterra Dairy Co-operative. The factory processes 1.2 million litres of milk per day during the peak of the milk production season, producing milk powders, cream, butter and <b>canned</b> <b>butter</b> for tropical countries where refrigeration is not always available.|$|E
50|$|Food for {{the trip}} had to be compact, lightweight, and nonperishable. The more {{knowledgeable}} also brought dried fruit and vegetables to provide some variety (and Vitamin C) and were a known (to many) scurvy prevention. The method of preparing desiccated vegetables was to squeeze them in a press to remove most of their juice and then bake them for several hours in a low temperature oven. The vegetables like dried peas kept well if kept dry {{and a piece of}} dried vegetables the size of a fist when put in water and cooked could feed four. The recommended food to take per adult for the four- to six-month trip was 150 lb of flour, 20 lb of corn meal, 50 lb of bacon, 40 lb of sugar, 10 lb of coffee, 15 lb of dried fruit, 5 lb of salt, half a pound (0.25 kg) of saleratus (baking soda), 2 lb of tea, 5 lb of rice, and 15 lb of beans. Condiments like: mustard, cinnamon, nutmeg, vinegar, pepper and other spices were usually included. Ex-trappers, ex-army soldiers and Indians often used pemmican made by pounding jerky until it was a coarse meal, putting it into a leather bag and then pouring rendered fat (and sometimes pulverized dried berries) over it—this was very light weight, could keep for months and provided a lot of energy. Some families took along milk cows and goats for milk and chickens (penned in crates tied to the wagons) for eggs and chicken dinners. Additional food like pickles, <b>canned</b> <b>butter,</b> cheese or pickled eggs were occasionally carried, but canned goods were expensive and relatively heavy to carry and food preservation was primitive, so few perishable items could be safely kept for the four to six-month duration of the trip. These provisions were usually kept in water-tight containers and carried inside the covered wagon to minimize getting wet. At river crossings their food usually had to be removed and carried across on a boat or raft to keep it dry—one of the reasons toll bridges or ferries were popular. Meat filled barrels (200 lb) were often bought and then, to reduce weight, the bacon and ham were usually transferred to bran filled sacks and stuck {{in the bottom of the}} wagons to stay as cool as possible—the barrel being discarded. In hot weather bacon and ham was often hauled in large barrels packed in bran so the hot sun would not melt the fat. Medicinal supplies carried usually consisted of salves and ointments, laudanum (about the only effective pain medicine then and much over used), and a few home remedies.|$|E
