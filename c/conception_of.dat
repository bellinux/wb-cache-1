The self-rated academic achievement of students who endorsed all six <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> learning was higher than that of students who endorsed fewer <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> learning.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Prospective {{teachers}} enter {{teacher education}} programs with previously formed <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> geometry and its teaching. These conceptions help them make sense of new information about teaching, their roles as teachers, and their translation of mathematics into learning activities. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the relationships among preservice teachers' <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> geometry, <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> teaching geometry and classroom practices. Ten preservice mathematics teachers completed a card sort task with an interview. They also participated in a videotape task which consisted of viewing three experienced geometry teachers on videotape. Four of these preservice teachers were observed eight times each during their professional internship experience. All interviews and observations were videotaped and transcribed for data analysis. Results of this study indicated a complex relationship between the preservice teachers' <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> geometry and <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> teaching geometry. The preservice teachers could not discuss their <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> geometry without discussing the teaching <b>of</b> geometry. Their <b>conceptions</b> about geometry and their belief that geometry was linear, in nature were so strong that these views became connected with their views of teaching geometry. Clearly, the preservice teachers' <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> geometry influenced their <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> teaching geometry and the teaching of subject matter influenced the preservice teachers' <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> geometry as well. The relationship between the preservice teachers' <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> geometry and their classroom practices was directly influenced by the textbooks used. They believed geometry was ordered according to the textbook and their classroom practices also followed the textbook. The relationship of the preservice teachers' <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> geometry teaching to classroom practices indicated that what the preservice teachers said they believed and what they did in the classroom were not always consistent. Their beliefs about teaching geometry rarely emerged in their classroom practices. Finally, these preservice teachers had an overwhelming concern with classroom management.

Using data collected through interviews six qualitatively different <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> learning were identified.

Although sometimes described as plain dux or ealdorman, his status was clearly quite different from that of other duces, for he is also accorded styles which aspire to divine grace and which appear to verge on the royal. In other words, there is no mistaking that the Mercians retained a <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> their ruler as a rightful successor to earlier kings, and a <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> their land as a kingdom with its own identity; but there is also no mistaking that Æthelred moved in an Alfredian world.|$|E

40|$|This chapter explores whether current {{accounting}} technology fulfils the stewardship {{and accountability}} information needs of family business owners. As the influences on contemporary accounting are both conceptual and contextual we frame {{our discussion in}} terms of both the knowledge foundations of accounting, as informed by various <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> the firm, and stakeholder theory. We posit that if prevailing <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> the firm impact the knowledge foundations of accounting, and subsequently the nature and form of accounting practice, then it is the <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> influential stakeholders that can define the accounting change agenda and affect contemporary accounting practice. We use extant research and practice to identify what <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> the firm prevail and whether these are consistent with <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> family firms. We identify two streams of literature relevant to our review. The conceptual stream focuses on <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> the firm {{and the extent to which}} particular conceptions are encapsulated within accounting regulation and practice. We find that recent international accounting regulation evidences a shift in <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> the firm that aligns better with the stewardship orientation of family business owners. The empirical stream largely focuses on financial reporting quality and performance differences between publicly listed family and non-family firms. As the majority of family firms are private, this literature sheds limited light on accountability issues pertinent to family firms. Accordingly we identify opportunities for further empirical research connecting financial reporting quality and performance issues with alternative <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> the firm...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT In this study, a {{descriptive}} quantitative methodology for categorical data analysis that {{works well with}} small samples was used to investigate whether Chinese students’ <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> learning included memorisation {{as an integral part}} of understanding, as suggested by phenomenographic studies. Twenty-five Chinese students attending the B. Ed. programme at the University of Hong Kong were asked to rank order six <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> learning. Results revealed an interesting multidimensional structure, suggesting that memoris-ing was seen as clearly distinct from knowledge and understanding. Contrasting <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> learning (such as memorisation vs changing as a person) were identified, similar to the previous distinction made between conceptions lacking, or being concerned with, constitutive meaning. These findings suggest multidimensional aspects to <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> learning for Chinese students that extend the notion of memorisation–understanding relations. Further inquiry in the areas of context, awareness, and types of memorisation would shed light on Chinese students’ <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> learning. It is suggested that quantitative methodologies ideally suited to categorical data analysis with small samples could be used to supplement the results of qualitative phenomenographic methodologies on student <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> learning...|$|R
40|$|New {{learning}} theory, underpinning {{the idea}} of teaching for self-directed learning, provides new <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> learning: the self-regulation of learning, the construct-character of knowledge, the social nature of learning, and a dynamic model <b>of</b> intelligence.

We constructed a Learning Inventory, and administered this to teachers in Dutch senior secondary education, where an innovation is heading for more independent learning. We found empirical confirmation of the five dimensions underlying teachers' <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> learning, both for student learning and for their own learning. Tolerance of uncertainty explained the other four dimensions in <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> student learning, but not in teachers' <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> their own learning. Teachers generally endorse the process-oriented conceptions, although some differences are noted between teachers' <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> student learning and their own learning...|$|R
