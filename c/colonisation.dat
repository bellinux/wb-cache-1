5|$|In the 16th century, {{when the}} Spanish <b>colonisation</b> {{in the area}} began, El Hatillo was {{inhabited}} by the Mariches, an indigenous people possibly related to the Kalina (Caribs). Cacique Tamanaco {{was the leader of}} these tribes, known for resisting the Spanish <b>colonisation.</b> As the <b>colonisation</b> developed, the indigenous inhabitants were killed; by order of Caracas's founder Diego de Losada, Tamanaco was also murdered.|$|E
5|$|After mating in August or September, {{the female}} katipo {{produces}} {{five or six}} egg sacs in November or December. The spiderlings hatch during January and February and disperse into surrounding plants. Due to habitat loss and <b>colonisation</b> of their natural habitat by other exotic spiders, the katipo is threatened with extinction.|$|E

5|$|In Australia, the <b>colonisation</b> {{began in}} the 1940s, with the species {{establishing}} itself {{in the north and}} east of the continent. It began to regularly visit New Zealand in the 1960s. Since 1948 the cattle egret has been permanently resident in Israel. Prior to 1948 it was only a winter visitor.|$|E
5|$|In {{some areas}} of Nigeria, ethnic groups speak more than one language. The {{official}} language of Nigeria, English, was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country, owing {{to the influence of}} British <b>colonisation</b> that ended in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Liliaceae sensu Dahlgren {{arose in}} Eurasia, while within Liliaceae sensu Dahlgren the Lilieae s.s. subclade {{arose in the}} Himalayas (Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau), with later {{radiation}} there in montane and alpine habitats. Species of Lilium and Fritillaria then dispersed {{into the rest of}} Eurasia and North America. The second subclade, the Tulipeae arose in East Asia with subsequent <b>colonisation</b> of North America by Erythronium and Lloydia. On the other hand, Clintonia-Medeola (Medeoleae) may have appeared in North America but subsequently underwent intercontintental dispersal (although some evidence points to a Eurasian origin). The Calochortaceae sensu Tamura (Streptopoideae and Calochortoideae) appears to have evolved in western North America, with subsequent <b>colonisation</b> of East Asia by Streptopus and the ancestral Tricyrtis.|$|E
40|$|The {{spread of}} Homo sapiens out of Africa and the {{subsequent}} continent <b>colonisations</b> and migrations have been reconstructed through the analyses of data reported by several disciplines, such as paleoanthropology, archaeology, linguistics and genetics. The joint effort of these disciplines has allowed having a broad knowledge about the tempo and mode {{of the origin of}} our species and the major <b>colonisations</b> at a continental level (Jobling et al., 2004). However, some local migration routes, especially those within continents, are far for been completely understood...|$|R

5|$|A gull colony {{has been}} present since 1984, {{although}} gulls were seen briefly {{on the shores}} of the new island only weeks after it first appeared. The gull colony has been particularly important in developing the plant life on Surtsey, and the gulls have had much more of an impact on plant <b>colonisation</b> than other breeding species due to their abundance. An expedition in 2004 found the first evidence of nesting Atlantic puffins, which are extremely common {{in the rest of the}} archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Although England trailed behind other European {{powers in}} {{establishing}} overseas colonies, {{it had been}} engaged during the 16th century in the settlement of Ireland with Protestants from England and Scotland, drawing on precedents {{dating back to the}} Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169. Several people who helped establish the Plantations of Ireland also played a part in the early <b>colonisation</b> of North America, particularly a group known as the West Country men.|$|E

40|$|In {{a recent}} Discussion Paper, Hoffmann and Courchamp (2016) posed the question: are {{biological}} invasions and natural <b>colonisations</b> that different? This apparently simple question resonates {{at the core}} of the biological study of human-induced global change, and we strongly believe that the answer is yes: biological invasions and natural <b>colonisations</b> differ in processes and mechanisms in ways that are crucial for science, management, and policy. Invasion biology has, over time, developed into the broader transdisciplinary field of invasion science. At the heart of invasion science is the realisation that biological invasions are not just a biological phenomenon: the human dimension of invasions is a fundamental component in the social-ecological systems in which invasions need to be understood and managed...|$|R
3000|$|Nosocomial infections {{occurring}} during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support {{have already}} been reported, but few studied infections directly related to ECMO devices.

5|$|C. c. coronoides, the {{nominate}} or eastern subspecies, {{is found}} across most of eastern Australia. Its range is also {{highly correlated with}} the presence of sheep. This is thought to be because of the frequency of dead animals, which can be an important source of food. Ornithologist Ian Rowley held that the eastern subspecies was expanding eastwards before European <b>colonisation,</b> and that this suggested it was of younger origin than the western subspecies, which appears static. The advent of agriculture facilitated further spread.|$|E
5|$|Differences in songs, {{genetics}} and morphology {{suggests that the}} Azores were colonised in a single invasion in the late Pleistocene, about 100,000 years ago. It {{is likely that the}} initial <b>colonisation</b> was of the easternmost islands, with a subsequent spread to the central and western island groups from the western caldera of São Miguel, where both eastern and western song types are found.|$|E
5|$|During {{early years}} of <b>colonisation,</b> the {{surrounding}} trees were cut down and the river's gravel used in road making and construction of buildings. As the natural environment was removed, the banks were eroded and the riverbed gradually levelled as waterholes filled. By 1878 the river was noted to be a malodorous, black sewer rather than the sylvan stream of the 1830s.|$|E

50|$|Siamoperadectes is {{the most}} southerly known peradectid. The close {{relations}} to Chinese peradectids like Sinoperadectes and Junggaroperadectes suggest {{that it had a}} Laurasian origin rather than having evolved in the Indian subcontinent, and alongside African and Indian herpetotheriids and true marsupials it represents one of several Cenozoic metatherian <b>colonisations</b> of southern landmasses.|$|R
40|$|Madagascar has an {{exceptionally}} large fauna {{of more than}} 250 species of endemic dung beetles. Based on molecular phylogenies, the species descend from eight independent overseas <b>colonisations,</b> of which four {{have given rise to}} big radiations. Here we analyse the tribe Canthonini with three parallel radiations following the respective <b>colonisations</b> at 64 - 44 Mya (Arachnodes-Epilissus, 101 species), 30 - 19 Mya (Epactoides, 37 species), and 24 - 15 Mya (Apotolamprus-Nanos, 61 species). All three radiations have taken place in forests, but there are also substantial differences between them. The oldest radiation exhibits the greatest ecological diversification, including monophyletic groups of primate and cattle dung specialists and multiple shifts to arboreal foraging. Analysis of pairs of sister species suggests allopatric speciation in the oldest and the youngest, apparently nonadaptive, radiations, whereas in Epactoides closely related species have diverged ecologically and have largely overlapping geographical ranges, suggestive of adaptive radiation in parapatry or regional sympatry. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|Even {{before his}} {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of Belgium in 1865, the future king Leopold II began lobbying leading Belgian politicians to create a colonial empire in the Far East or Africa, which would expand and enhance Belgian prestige. Politically, however, <b>colonisation</b> was unpopular in Belgium as it was perceived as a risky and expensive gamble with no obvious benefit {{to the country and}} his many attempts to persuade politicians met with little success.|$|E
5|$|Exploration and <b>colonisation</b> of North and South America {{resulted}} in the introduction into Europe of such crops as maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes and manioc, while the principal Old World livestock – cattle, horses, sheep and goats – were introduced into the New World {{for the first time}} along with wheat, barley, rice and turnips.|$|E
5|$|Hoskins {{describes}} {{the abandonment of}} villages from the bubonic plague of 1348, the Black Death, which killed a third to a half of the population (he states), and the subsequent new <b>colonisation</b> and building as the population eventually recovered. Marginal land such as the Breckland of Norfolk and Suffolk, never thickly populated, was abandoned. Many villages in counties such as Leicestershire were deserted. Villages such as Lower Ditchford in Gloucestershire can be seen today only as a ground-plan from the air.|$|E
2500|$|The Works and Days is a poem of over 800 lines which {{revolves}} around two general truths: labour is the universal lot of Man, but he {{who is willing}} to work will get by. Scholars have interpreted this work against a background of agrarian crisis in mainland Greece, which inspired a wave of documented <b>colonisations</b> in search of new land. [...] This poem is one of the earliest known musings on economic thought.|$|R
50|$|The {{language}} of the Daru people is Kiwai (South-West Coastal Kiwai), also spoken on neighbouring mainland villages (the name Kiwai comes from Kiwai Island further north-west in the Fly River delta). However, the Kiwai settlement of Daru is fairly recent. The original inhabitants, the Hiamo, were Western-Central Torres Strait Islanders originally from Yama in the Torres Strait. With the Kiwai <b>colonisations,</b> the main group of Hiamo people moved to Southern Torres Strait and settled the Muralag group.|$|R
50|$|There are two subspecies, Streptopelia decaocto decaocto {{in most of}} {{the range}} (including all of the 20th century <b>colonisations),</b> and Streptopelia decaocto xanthocyclus in the {{southeast}} of the range from Burma east to southern China. The latter differs in having yellow skin around the eye (white in the nominate subspecies). Two other subspecies formerly sometimes accepted, Streptopelia decaocto stoliczkae from Turkestan in central Asia, and Streptopelia decaocto intercedens from southern India and Sri Lanka, are now considered synonyms of S. d. decaocto.|$|R
5|$|In 616 Æthelfrith of Bernicia, an Anglo-Saxon King, {{crossed the}} Pennines with an army and passed through Manchester {{to defeat the}} Britons in the Battle of Chester. A wave of Anglian colonists {{followed}} this military conquest and their settlements are identified by the Old English suffix ton in local place names. Royton, Middleton, Moston, Clayton, Ashton and Crompton are localities northeast of Manchester {{which may have been}} founded during that <b>colonisation,</b> suggesting that Crompton as a settlement could date from the 7th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{ecosystems}} such as mangrove swamps, trees {{play a role}} {{in developing}} the habitat, since the roots of the mangrove trees reduce the speed of flow of tidal currents and trap water-borne sediment, reducing the water depth and creating suitable conditions for further mangrove <b>colonisation.</b> Thus mangrove swamps tend to extend seawards in suitable locations. Mangrove swamps also provide an effective buffer against the more damaging effects of cyclones and tsunamis.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, the first {{vascular}} plant was found growing on the northern shore of Surtsey, mosses became visible in 1967, and lichens were first found on the Surtsey lava in 1970. Plant <b>colonisation</b> on Surtsey has been closely studied, the vascular plants in particular {{as they have been}} of far greater significance than mosses, lichens and fungi in the development of vegetation.|$|E
25|$|From the exploitations of the Dutch East India Company in the 17th century, to the <b>colonisations</b> in the 19th century, Dutch {{imperial}} possessions {{continued to}} expand, reaching their greatest extent {{by establishing a}} hegemony of the Dutch East Indies in the early 20th century. The Dutch East Indies, which later formed modern-day Indonesia, {{was one of the}} most valuable European colonies in the world and the most important one for the Netherlands. Over 350 years of mutual heritage has left a significant cultural mark on the Netherlands.|$|R
50|$|Ever {{since the}} 16th century, during <b>colonisations</b> of Sri Lanka by the Portuguese, Dutch and English, Christian missionaries had {{attempted}} to convert the Buddhist population into Christianity, with the general belief during this period being {{that there was nothing}} worthy of study in non-Christian religions. In the early 19th century, this view started to change, into the conviction that every evangelist should have sound knowledge in Buddhism. The most prominent Christian scholars supporting this conviction were Daniel John Gogerly, C. H. S. Ward, and Robert Spence Hardy.|$|R
40|$|A {{previously}} unsurveyed calcrete aquifer in the Yilgarn {{region of}} Western Australia revealed an unprecedented diversity of copepods, representing 67 % of that previously recorded {{in this whole}} region. Especially diverse was the genus Schizopera, with up to four morphospecies per bore and a significant size difference between them. Aims {{of this study were}} to: (1) survey the extent of this diversity using morphological and molecular tools; (2) derive a molecular phylogeny based on COI; and (3) investigate whether high diversity is a result of an explosive radiation, repeated <b>colonisations,</b> or both, size differentiation is a result of parallel evolution or different phylogeny, and whether Schizopera is a recent invasion in inland waters. More than 300 samples were analysed and the COI fragment successfully amplified by PCR from 43 specimens. Seven species and one subspecies are described as new, and three possible cryptic species were detected. Reconstructed phylogenies reveal that both explosive radiation and multiple <b>colonisations</b> are responsible for this richness, and that Schizopera is probably a recent invasion in these habitats. No evidence for parallel evolution was found, interspecific size differentiation being a result of different phylogeny. Sister species have parapatric distributions and show niche partitioning in the area of overlap. Tomislav Karanovic and Steven J. B. Coope...|$|R
