40|$|Location-based {{services}} (LBS) requires generating real-time personalized {{and dynamic}} <b>cartographic</b> <b>symbols.</b> In order to tackle this problem, this paper proposes a structural description model and a dynamic generation method of <b>cartographic</b> <b>symbols</b> based on cognitive analysis. Following the cognitive semantics principle of‘reality-cognition-symbol’, the description model elaborates the mapping mechanism between symbol graphics and symbol semantics, which uses symbol morphemes as atomic units and semantic structure as description framework. The generation method {{is composed of}} a context-free grammar model which uses rules to generate <b>cartographic</b> <b>symbols</b> {{on the basis of}} morphemes. Through the modelling of graphic morphemes, structural morphemes and rule-based generation system, a grammar compiler for dynamic generation of <b>cartographic</b> <b>symbols</b> is redesigned. Lastly, experiments of dynamic generation of <b>cartographic</b> <b>symbols</b> in different contexts and semantics are performed to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. Therefore, this study leads to a further understanding of cognition and structure principles of <b>cartographic</b> <b>symbols,</b> and also pushes forward dynamic generation of <b>cartographic</b> <b>symbols</b> for related industries and applications...|$|E

INTRODUCTION Machine-interpretation of cartographic maps has come to occupy an important place in the burgeoning document-image-processing industry. Several comprehensive collections of papers on this topic are now available [1]. Cartographers often use predefined symbols to convey such `meanings' associated with logical structures represented in maps. Recognition of <b>cartographic</b> <b>symbols</b> is, therefore, an important aspect of any map-interpretation system. In this paper, we describe a method for recognizing <b>cartographic</b> <b>symbols</b> that has been developed for processing digital images of land-registry maps in Switzerland.

For the purpose of analysis of the vastness there are defined geometric criteria in the thesis. These criteria take account of both the overall layout of the castle complex and the individual elements of the castle layout. All of these criteria are also applicable to all analysed castles. The analysis of vastness is realized with ArcGIS software; main source of data are geodetic plans from National Heritage Institute, additional data sources include Orthophoto CR and Digital Terrain Model 5 th Generation. The numerical results of the partial criteria, presented in the results of the work, make it possible to determine the largest castle in our country or the castle with the biggest area according to individual elements of the castle layout. The analysis of depiction of castles on early maps is focused {{on the development of the}} <b>cartographic</b> <b>symbol</b> used for representation of these objects, the frequency of castles and used nomeclature in selected maps.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} of the present deliberations was to systematise our knowledge of static visual variables used to create <b>cartographic</b> <b>symbols,</b> and also to analyse the possibility of their utilisation in the Augmented Reality (AR) applications on smartphone-type mobile devices. This was accomplished by combining the visual variables listed {{over the years by}} different researchers. Research approach was to determine the level of usefulness of particular characteristics of visual variables such as selective, associative, quantitative and order. An attempt was made to provide an overview of static visual variables and to describe the AR system which is a new paradigm of the user interface. Changing the approach to the presentation of point objects is caused by applying diffe-rent perspective in the observation of objects (egocentric view) than it is done on traditional analogue maps (geocentric view). Presented topics will refer to the fast-developing field of cartography, namely mobile cartography.

40|$|A {{significant}} void in humanitarian demining, in both landmine {{removal operations}} {{as well as}} public education activities, {{is the lack of}} a common or standardized set of <b>cartographic</b> <b>symbols</b> for maps and Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

For this reason, the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD) recently contracted the University of Kansas to research <b>cartographic</b> <b>symbols</b> used for demining purposes, and to design a recommended set of symbols that may be implemented and promoted in the GICHDs Information Management System for Mine Action (IMSMA). Prior to designing the recommended symbols, current symbols used by several military and humanitarian demining organizations were compiled into a catalog to assess similarities and differences in symbol designs amongst organizations. The recommended symbol set was designed based in part on existing symbols as well as standard cartographic principles and conventions. Recently, the recommended symbols have been implemented in a new version of IMSMA, and will be promulgated among humanitarian demining organizations, mapping agencies, and GIS vendors...|$|E
40|$|Processes of {{terrestrial}} geologic mapping and preparation of geologic maps {{are supported by}} Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and respective datamodels of which an assessable number are currently available. Such datamodels help mappers to define spatial geologic map units by integrating field and remote-sensing information and relate them to non-spatial information about unit details, in particular rock composition, age and age relationships, attitude data, and other characteristics. Apart from any interpretive tasks concerned with the delineation of various surface units in terms of geological and geomorphological boundaries and contents, basic mapping tasks involve an efficient management of attribute data needed for (1) applying an assignment of standardized <b>cartographic</b> <b>symbols</b> or color schemes, (2) performing spatial queries and data analyses, or for (3) combining and homogenizing mapping results generated by different groups. A unit usually carries multiple assignments to which an appropriate cartographic symbology representation is related. Such an assignment may describe the surface unit material, its stratigraphic name and relative position, or its chronostratigraphic and absolute position. The assignments of surface materials or the assignments of stratigraphic units within or without an absolute chronologic context and the subsequent selection of <b>cartographic</b> <b>symbols</b> can usually be handled using a standard geologic relationship model for which surface materials {{are the most important}} attributes.

For example, in a cartographic legend, a point of interest symbol is identified as a concept with its icon and/or abbreviation, color, texture, font style, orientation or number. The overall concerns of our research are to integrate different legends as visual ontologies towards a unique reference one (base map and symbols from many providers).

So, {{the idea of}} geographical information cartographic representation is presented {{to improve the quality}} of the geographical information visualization and to satisfy rules of traditional cartography. The digital cartographic representation, which tries to make a model of the mapping procedure based on traditional cartographic knowledge, creates a template-mapping model for <b>cartographic</b> <b>symbols.</b> This template-mapping model achieves the transformation from cartographic specifications to products. Meanwhile, it can well consider characteristics of respective geographical feature, the relations between this feature and other features, the relations between this feature and cartographic region. These three kinds of relations are described with quantity parameters which can be used to map a symbol template to a symbol instance responding to some one geographical feature. With this template-mapping model for cartographic symbol, we can visualize the respective feature’s property in detail and improve the quality of geographical visualization. Hydrology and transportation features are taken as two examples to verify the availability of this cartographic representation model. 1...|$|E
