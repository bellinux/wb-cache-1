5|$|Despite ongoing {{threats from}} the Khmer Rouge during the elections, on 28 May 1993, FUNCINPEC won 45.47 {{percent of the}} vote, against 38.23 percent for the <b>Cambodian</b> People’s Party. Though clearly defeated, Hun Sen {{refused to accept the}} results of the election, so his Defense Minister, Sin Song, {{announced}} the secession of the eastern provinces of Cambodia, which had supported the <b>Cambodian</b> People’s Party. Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of FUNCINPEC and son of Sihanouk, agreed to form a coalition government with the <b>Cambodian</b> People’s Party so the country would not break up. On 21 September 1993, the <b>Cambodian</b> Constituent Assembly approved a new Constitution and Ranariddh became First Prime Minister, and he appointed Hun Sen as the Second Prime Minister. On 23 September 1993, the constitutional monarchy was restored with Norodom Sihanouk as the head of state. In July 1994, the <b>Cambodian</b> Government outlawed the Khmer Rouge for its continuous violations of the Paris Agreement. Most significantly, the <b>Cambodian</b> Government also specifically recognised the genocide and atrocities which occurred under Democratic Kampuchea. By 1998, the Khmer Rouge was completely dissolved.|$|E
5|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the U.S. bombing on the Khmer Rouge and the death toll of <b>Cambodian</b> civilians is disputed. With limited data, the range of <b>Cambodian</b> deaths caused by U.S. bombing may be between 40,000 and 150,000 <b>Cambodian</b> civilians and Khmer Rouge fighters. Another impact of the U.S. bombing and the <b>Cambodian</b> civil war was to destroy the homes and livelihood of many people. This was a heavy contributor to the refugee crisis in Cambodia with two million people—more than 25 percent of the population—displaced from rural areas into the cities, especially Phnom Penh which grew from about 600,000 in 1970 to an estimated population of nearly 2 million by 1975. The <b>Cambodian</b> government estimated that more than 20 percent of the property in the country had been destroyed during the war.|$|E
5|$|At the Third Jakarta Informal Meeting in 1990, {{under the}} Australian-sponsored <b>Cambodian</b> Peace Plan, {{representatives of the}} CGDK and the PRK agreed to a power-sharing {{arrangement}} by forming a unity government known as the Supreme National Council (SNC). The SNC's role was to represent <b>Cambodian</b> sovereignty on the international stage, while the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) was tasked with supervising the country's domestic policies until a <b>Cambodian</b> government was elected by the people through a peaceful, democratic process. Cambodia's pathway to peace proved to be difficult, as Khmer Rouge leaders decided {{not to participate in}} the general elections, but instead they chose to disrupt the electoral process by launching military attacks on UN peacekeepers and killing ethnic Vietnamese migrants. In May 1993, Sihanouk's FUNCINPEC movement defeated the <b>Cambodian</b> People's Party (CPP), formerly the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party (KPRP), to win the general elections. However, the CPP leadership refused to accept defeat and they announced that the eastern provinces of Cambodia, where most of the CPP's votes were drawn from, would secede from Cambodia. To avoid such an outcome, Norodom Ranariddh, the leader of FUNCINPEC agreed to form a coalition government with the CPP. Shortly afterwards, the constitutional monarchy was restored and the Khmer Rouge was outlawed by the newly formed <b>Cambodian</b> Government.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cambodian</b> Rocks is a {{compilation}} of 22 uncredited, untitled <b>Cambodian</b> psychedelic and garage rock songs from the late 1960s and early 1970s. When the tracks were recorded, musicians in the thriving music scene were combining Western rock and pop genres with their own styles and techniques. When the Khmer Rouge {{came to power in}} 1975, artists were among those viewed {{as a threat to the}} regime's agrarian socialist vision, and several of the performers on the album are believed to have been among those killed during the ensuing <b>Cambodian</b> Genocide of 1975-1979. Little information about them or their creative output has survived.|$|E

50|$|Between 1981 and 1985 about 150,000 <b>Cambodians</b> resettled in the United States. Before 1975 {{very few}} <b>Cambodians</b> {{came to the}} United States. Those who did were {{children}} of upper-class families sent abroad to attend school. After the fall of Phnom Penh to the communist Khmer Rouge in 1975, some <b>Cambodians</b> managed to escape. In 2007 the American Community Survey reported that there were approximately 200,000 <b>Cambodians</b> living in the United States, making up about 2% percent of the Asian population. This population is, however, heavily concentrated in two areas: the Los Angeles metropolitan area in California, especially the city of Long Beach; and Greater Boston in New England, especially Lowell, Massachusetts.

50|$|At least 600,000 <b>Cambodians</b> {{had been}} {{displaced}} during the Pol Pot era when cities had been emptied. After the Vietnamese invasion freed them, most <b>Cambodians</b> {{who had been}} forcefully resettled elsewhere in the countryside returned to the cities or to their original rural homesteads. Since families had been disrupted and separated, many <b>Cambodians</b> freed from their communes wandered over the country searching for family members and friends.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 1975, {{most of the}} few <b>Cambodians</b> in Australia were {{children}} of upper income families or having government funded scholarships sent abroad to attend school.

5|$|The California band Dengue Fever, {{known for}} its Khmer rock performances, has {{recorded}} a number of covers of tracks from <b>Cambodian</b> Rocks.

5|$|The <b>Cambodian</b> Campaign (also {{known as}} the <b>Cambodian</b> Incursion and the <b>Cambodian</b> Invasion) {{was a series of}} {{military}} operations conducted in eastern Cambodia during 1970 by the United States and the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) during the Vietnam War. The invasions were a policy of President Richard Nixon; 13 major operations were conducted by the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) between 29 April and 22 July and by US forces between 1 May and 30 June.|$|E

50|$|Numerically, the Khmer are the {{dominant}} group among <b>Cambodians</b> in France, but <b>Cambodians</b> of Chinese descent {{can also be found}} among the population; though interethnic marriages between Chinese and Khmers were common in Cambodia and remain so in France, the Chinese they have tended to organise themselves around the varieties they speak and remain somewhat separate from other <b>Cambodians</b> in France. A small number of <b>Cambodians</b> in France consist of the wives and mixed-race children of French colonisers who repatriated to France between 1955 and 1965; regardless of their ethnicity, many of those used Khmer rather than French as their home language.|$|R
50|$|Many of the <b>Cambodians</b> in {{the refugee}} and border camps {{remained}} there for years, fearful of returning to their country and desiring resettlement abroad.

5|$|In August 1994, the National Assembly of Cambodia {{introduced}} an immigration law which authorises the deportation of illegal immigrants. The UNHCR perceived {{the law as}} targeting Vietnamese migrants in Cambodia, and the <b>Cambodian</b> government later stepped in to assure that no mass deportations of Vietnamese refugees would be implemented. The Khmer Rouge continued to carry out sporadic attacks on Vietnamese civilians until they surrendered in 1999. Ethnic Vietnamese continue to face discrimination from <b>Cambodian</b> society, and encountered physical intimidation from society and government authorities especially during the general elections or when disputes between Cambodia and Vietnam arise.|$|E
5|$|Most Vietnamese are unrepresented in the <b>Cambodian</b> commune councils as {{they lack}} <b>Cambodian</b> citizenship. According to {{respondents}} from Ehrentraut's field research, {{the majority of}} <b>Cambodian</b> commune chiefs and officials express support in excluding Vietnamese representatives from getting citizenship and participating commune elections and meetings due to contempt. The Vietnamese appoint their own village heads, and convey community concerns Vietnamese community associations (Vietnamese: Tổng hội người Campuchia gốc Việt) that was first established in 2003. The community associations own limited assets and obtains funding from membership fees, donations from the Vietnamese embassy in Cambodia and sale of cemetery land from the Vietnamese communities. The funds are subsequently used to address Vietnamese communal concerns which includes supporting religious places of worship and teaching of the Vietnamese language, {{as well as providing}} assistance to disadvantaged families. While the community associations have the tacit support of the Vietnamese community, the majority do not accept membership for fear of getting social stigma from mainstream <b>Cambodian</b> society. As of 2013, branches of these associations are established in 19 out of 23 provinces across Cambodia.|$|E
5|$|Ranariddh is a {{graduate}} of the University of Provence and started his career as a law researcher and lecturer in France.

Ranariddh became the secretary-general of FUNCINPEC in 1989, and its president in 1992. When FUNCINPEC won the 1993 <b>Cambodian</b> general election, it formed a coalition government with the <b>Cambodian</b> People's Party (CPP), which was jointly headed by two concurrently serving prime ministers. Ranariddh became the First Prime Minister of Cambodia while Hun Sen, who was from the CPP, became the Second Prime Minister. As the First Prime Minister, Ranariddh promoted business interests in Cambodia to leaders from regional countries and established the <b>Cambodian</b> Development Council (CDC).|$|E

50|$|Prior to 1975, {{most of the}} few <b>Cambodians</b> in the United States were {{children}} of high-income families or had government-funded scholarships sent abroad to attend school. There was no history of immigration from Cambodia into the United States. After the fall of Phnom Penh to the communist Khmer Rouge in 1975, a few <b>Cambodians</b> managed to escape {{but it was only}} after the régime was overthrown in 1979 did large waves of <b>Cambodians</b> began immigrating to the US as refugees. Between 1975 and 1994, nearly 158,000 <b>Cambodians</b> were admitted. About 149,000 of them entered the country as refugees, and 6,000 entered as immigrants and 2,500 as humanitarian and public interest parolees. To encourage rapid cultural assimilation and to spread the economic impact, the US government settled the refugees in various towns and cities throughout the country. However, once established {{enough to be able to}} communicate and travel, many <b>Cambodians</b> began migrating to certain places that the climate was more like home, they knew friends and relatives had been sent, or there were rumored to be familiar jobs or higher government benefits. Consequently, large communities of <b>Cambodians</b> took root in cities such as Long Beach, Fresno and Stockton in California;Providence, Rhode Island; Cleveland, Ohio; as well as Lynn and Lowell in Massachusetts; and Seattle and Portland in the Pacific Northwest.|$|R
