5|$|Concentrating {{solar plants}} in the Mojave Desert have brought up issues of water use, because concentrating solar power plants with wet-cooling systems have high water-consumption intensities {{compared}} to other types of electric power plants; only fossil-fuel plants with carbon-capture and storage may have higher water intensities. A 2013 study comparing various sources of electricity found that the median water consumption during operations of concentrating solar power plants with wet cooling was 810 ga/MWhr for power tower plants and 890 gal/MWhr for trough plants. This was higher than the operational water consumption (with <b>cooling</b> <b>towers)</b> for nuclear (720 gal/MWhr), coal (530 gal/MWhr), or natural gas (210). A 2011 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory came to similar conclusions: for power plants with <b>cooling</b> <b>towers,</b> water consumption during operations was 865 gal/MWhr for CSP trough, 786 gal/MWhr for CSP tower, 687 gal/MWhr for coal, 672 gal/MWhr for nuclear, and 198 gal/MWhr for natural gas. The Solar Energy Industries Association noted that the Nevada Solar One trough CSP plant consumes 850 gal/MWhr.|$|E

5|$|Water is {{essential}} to a thermal power station, heated to create steam to turn the steam turbines. Water used in the boilers is taken from two licensed boreholes on site. Once this water has been through the turbines it is cooled by condensers using water taken from the nearby River Ouse. Water is pumped from the river by a pumphouse on the river, north of the station. Once it has been through the condenser, the water is cooled {{by one of the}} natural draft <b>cooling</b> <b>towers,</b> with two towers serving each generating set. Once cooled, the water is discharged back into the river.|$|E

Stella South, with a generating capacity of 300megawatts (MW), {{was built on}} the site of the Blaydon Races, and Stella North, with a capacity of 240MW, on that of the former Lemington Hall. They powered local homes and the many heavy industries of Tyne and Wear, Northumberland and County Durham. The large buildings, chimneys and <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> were visible from afar. Their operation required coal trains on both sides of the river to supply them with fuel and river traffic by flat iron barges to dump ash in the North Sea.

Following the stations' demolition, the sites underwent redevelopment: the North site into a large business and industrial park, the South into a housing estate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Cooling</b> <b>tower</b> in the HVAC {{industry}} {{is used to}} reject heat from a system. The refrigeration cycle requires that the heat absorbed from a refrigerated space be rejected and this is done through the condenser where {{the water from the}} <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> exchanges heat {{so that it can be}} discharged by the <b>cooling</b> <b>tower.</b> It is essential that the performance of the <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> be improved so the refrigerant cycle can take place at its optimum. The paper explores the area in the cross-flow <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> where the focus on where the porous media or the fill / packing is located and the area in the vicinity for a single phase flow. The behavior of the air intake flow into the <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> from the side part through the fill will be observed and how it affects the distribution of the air flow inside the fill will be analyzed. The solution of the related governing equation for the basic flow and for flow involving porous media will be presented. It was revealed that the porosity introduced a high pressure drop inside the <b>cooling</b> <b>tower.</b> The pressure inside the <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> generally is lower that before the porous media was introduced. The results also revealed that if the heat transfer inside the porous media is to be improved, higher dynamic pressure inside the <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> is required which would result in higher fan power output...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{a linear}} {{eigenvalue}} buckling parametric analysis is presented for various <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> shell geometries. The shells {{are subjected to}} increasing wind pressures (speeds) to observe the trends in the critical buckling pressures/speeds at which the shell first buckles and the corresponding buckling modes. The <b>cooling</b> <b>tower's</b> geometry is changed in a systematic manner to obtain the relationship between critical wind speeds associated with the first mode of buckling and the <b>cooling</b> <b>tower's</b> geometry. Geometrical parameter ratios of the <b>cooling</b> <b>tower's</b> dimensions are considered in order to cover a wider spectrum of the <b>cooling</b> <b>tower's</b> geometry. The critical wind speed versus height curve is observed {{to be similar to}} the Euler buckling curve. There appears to be a certain optimum throat height to total height ratio of about 0. 75 for any <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> at which the critical wind speed is maximum. The critical wind speed varies linearly with the <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> thickness and non-linearly with all diameter ratios. A linear eigenvalue vibration parametric analysis is presented for various <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> shell geometries to observe trends in the free vibration response (natural frequencies and mode shapes). The forced response of the <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> to various forcing frequencies of wind gusts is analysed using the mode superposition method. The shells are subjected to increasing wind gust periods of the same speed to obtain the trends in the forced vibration response (response frequencies and modes). The <b>cooling</b> <b>tower's</b> geometry is changed in a systematic manner to obtain the free and forced vibration behaviour. The natural frequencies and their corresponding bandwidths for the first ten different modes reduce with increasing height. They are generally invariant with the height to top diameter ratio, but the bandwidth increases with increasing height to top diameter ratio. The response frequencies and their corresponding bandwidths generally decrease with increasing height as well as the height to top diameter ratios. The response frequency generally decreases with decreasing forcing frequency, but not for all the <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> geometries.
