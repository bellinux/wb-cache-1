5|$|As {{a result}} of these negotiations, in September 2013 Syria joined the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Weapons</b> Convention (formally acceding on 14 October), and agreed to the {{destruction}} of its <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons,</b> {{under the supervision of the}} Organisation for the Prohibition of <b>Chemical</b> <b>Weapons,</b> as required by the Convention.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day, after the signing, Syria {{announced}} that it was acceding to the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Weapons</b> Convention (provisionally applying it directly, but formally taking effect 14 October 2013), and in doing so becoming a member of the OPCW. This committed Syria not to use <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons,</b> to destroy its <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> within 10 years, and to convert or destroy all of its <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> production facilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of Syria's <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> began in September 2013 {{on the basis}} of several international agreements with Syria that stipulated an initial destruction deadline of 30 June 2014. United Nations Security Council Resolution 2118 of 27 September 2013 required Syria to assume responsibility for and follow a timeline for the {{destruction of}} its <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> and its chemical weapon production facilities. The resolution bound Syria to the implementation plan presented in a decision of the Organisation for the Prohibition of <b>Chemical</b> <b>Weapons</b> (OPCW). On 23 June 2014, the last declared <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> were shipped out of Syria for destruction. The destruction of the most dangerous <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> was performed at sea aboard the Cape Ray, a vessel of the United States Maritime Administration's Ready Reserve Force, crewed with U.S. civilian merchant mariners. The actual destruction operations, performed by a team of U.S. Army civilians and contractors, destroyed 600 metric tons of chemical agents in 42 days. However, despite these efforts, the use of <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> in Syria have continued to be reported, with the latest being the chemical attack on Khan Shaykhun in April 2017, which has been alleged to have been perpetrated by the Syrian government.|$|E

5|$|East Timor {{ratified}} the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and <b>Chemical</b> <b>Weapons</b> Convention in 2003. The East Timorese Government {{has no plans}} to acquire nuclear, biological or <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons.</b> The country also became a party to the Ottawa Treaty, which bans anti-personnel mines, in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland did {{not possess}} {{biological}} weapons nor <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons,</b> {{nor did they}} see it as in their interest to acquire them. Thus the banning of such weapons was in the country's interest. Switzerland signed the Biological Weapons Convention in April 1972 and ratified the treaty in 1976 with three reservations. The country also signed the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Weapons</b> Convention in January 1993 and ratified it in March 1995.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Chemical</b> <b>weapon</b> {{victims are}} {{suffering}} from physical difficulties and psychological trainings may help to decrease these problems. The purpose {{of this research was}} to examine the effectiveness of mindfulness and emotion regulation training on physical and psychological well-being in <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon</b> victims. Methods: An experimental, pre-post and follow-up study designed. Forty seven <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon</b> victims men with low mental health in Sardasht city (North-Western Iran) randomly selected and assigned into three groups: 1 -Mindfulness training group 2 - Emotion regulation training group and 3 - Control group. The first two groups were received mindfulness-based stress eduction training and emotion regulation training respectively, while no training provided for control group. Data was collected using the General Health Questionnaire, and Physical Syndromes Scale. Analysis of variance with repeated measure was used for analyzing the data. Results: Results indicated that mindfulness and emotion regulation were significantly improved physical syndromes and mental health in <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon</b> victims. Also, the effectiveness of mindfulness in follow-up scores of physical syndromes and in post-test and follow-up scores of mental health was higher than the base line scores (P< 0. 01). Conclusion: Our findings confirmed effectiveness of mindfulness and emotion regulation on improvement of physical syndromes and mental health in <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon</b> victims. Therefore, mindfulness and emotion regulation training could be suggested for improvement of physical and psychological well-being among <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon</b> victims...|$|R

5|$|Use of CS in war is {{prohibited}} {{under the terms}} of the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Weapons</b> Convention, signed by most nations in 1993 with all but five other nations signing between 1994 and 1997. The reasoning behind the prohibition is pragmatic: use of CS by one combatant could easily trigger retaliation with much more toxic <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> such as nerve agents. Only four nations have not signed the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Weapons</b> Convention and are therefore unhindered by restrictions on the use of CS gas: Angola, Egypt, North Korea and Somalia.|$|E
5|$|Domestic police use of CS {{is legal}} in many countries, as the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Weapons</b> Convention prohibits only {{military}} use.|$|E
5|$|On 2 July, the Danish ship Ark Futura {{arrived in}} the Italian port of Gioia Tauro, {{carrying}} the <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons,</b> which were then loaded onto the U.S. ship Cape Ray. The Cape Ray was equipped with two Field Deployable Hydrolysis Systems capable of neutralizing the poisonous substances and converting them into industrial waste.

5|$|The first {{shipment}} of components for <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> {{were removed from}} Syria by a Norwegian/Danish flotilla on 7 January 2014. The 31 December deadline for complete removal of priority chemicals had been missed; on 7 January, the New York Times assessed the delay {{was due to the}} difficulty of overland transport of <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> {{in the middle of a}} civil war. A second shipment was removed around 27 January; that same day, the U.N. Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, expressed concern over the worsening delays and assessed that Syria already has the resources required to transport the weapons promptly despite the ongoing civil war.|$|E
5|$|The next mission (Scud Buster) entails {{locating}} {{and destroying}} a <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> plant {{and a number}} of scud launchers wielding chemically charged missiles, and evacuate local and American non-combatants and P.O.W.s.|$|E
5|$|Also {{exceptionally}} challenging will be {{the movement}} and destruction of deadly agents such as sarin, VX nerve agents and mustard agent during the civil war. The <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> convention disallows movement of such deadly agents outside the country holding them, but Security Council Resolution 2118 allows extraordinary measures {{to be taken in}} Syria. Some of the chemicals will need to be transported along the highway between Damascus and Homs, which is still contested as of December 2013. Syria has requested the international community provide armored vehicles to assist in safe transport of the chemicals. In February 2014, Syria stated that rebels had attempted to attack two convoys transporting <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|E

5|$|By 21 March, Syria's entire {{supply of}} mustard agent had been removed. On 27 April, Syria missed its revised 60-day {{deadline}} for complete removal of its full <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> arsenal. As at 23 May, Syria had removed or destroyed 92.5% of its declared chemical stockpile.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine, {{a common}} {{industrial}} chemical, {{is outside the}} scope of the disarmament agreement; however, its use as a poison gas would violate the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Weapons</b> Convention, which Syria joined in 2013.

A late disclosure in 2014 regarding Syria's ricin program raised doubts about completeness of the government's declaration of its <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> stockpile, and in early May 2015, OPCW announced that inspectors had found traces of sarin and VX nerve agent at a military research site in Syria that had not been declared previously by the Assad regime.|$|E
