5|$|Abu Nidal's {{most infamous}} {{operation}} was the 1985 {{attack on the}} Rome and Vienna airports. On 27 December, at 08:15 GMT, four gunmen opened fire on the El Al ticket counter at the Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport in Rome, killing 16 and wounding 99. In Vienna International Airport a few minutes later, three men threw hand grenades at passengers waiting to check into a flight to Tel Aviv, killing four and wounding 39. According to Seale, the gunmen had been told the people in civilian clothes at the <b>check-in</b> <b>counter</b> were Israeli pilots returning from a training mission.|$|E
5|$|The airline inaugurated {{scheduled}} revenue flights on 11 February 1983, with Flight 101 departing Paro for Kolkata {{and returning}} {{the next day}} as Flight 102. For the first four weeks the flight was operated three times a week, after which it was increased to a daily flight. At the time of service commencement, Paro Airport consisted of the runway, a two-room air traffic control building (with the ground floor acting as the <b>check-in</b> <b>counter)</b> and a departure lounge on the lawn. Prior {{to the establishment of}} the Department of Civil Aviation in January 1986, the airline was responsible for the operation and maintenance of airport infrastructure. The airline commenced flights to Dhaka in Bangladesh on 30 October 1986.|$|E
50|$|A common-use {{facility}} or terminal design disallows {{airlines to}} have its own proprietary <b>check-in</b> <b>counters,</b> gates and IT systems. Rather, <b>check-in</b> <b>counters</b> and gates can be flexibly reassigned as needed.|$|R
40|$|In {{a bid to}} {{increase}} airline business {{at one of the}} largest Asian airport, conflicting views of the availability of <b>check-in</b> <b>counters</b> drove the need for a more detailed analysis to aid decision making. We document here our attempt to determine the optimal number of <b>check-in</b> <b>counters</b> required for a single flight with 200 scheduled passengers in a 2 -hour check-in period using Monte Carlo Simulation. Our analysis of the passenger arrival pattern supported that the inter-arrival time can be approximated to follow an exponential distribution. By testing the Monte Carlo Simulation model with increasing number of <b>check-in</b> <b>counters,</b> we were able to conclude that three <b>check-in</b> <b>counters</b> were optimal to satisfy the service level requirement that at least 90 % of the passengers must be served within 10 minutes upon arrival at the check-in queue. Any {{increase in the number of}} <b>check-in</b> <b>counters</b> will not improve service level significantly and instead it will result in wastage of <b>check-in</b> <b>counters</b> which would be under-utilized. In additional, we further extend our analysis to cater for different passenger loads from 50 to 550 and determine the linear relationship between the number of counters required and passenger load...|$|R

25|$|The PAL Domestic Terminal 2 was {{refurbished}} in 1995, with {{a number}} of facilities being added or improved, including a renovated Mabuhay Lounge, an exclusive <b>check-in</b> <b>counter</b> for Mabuhay Class passengers, an Express Counter, refreshment bar, a medical clinic, an expansive waiting lounge and two baggage carousels in the arrival section. PAL facilities at NAIA were also renovated. The total cost for the renovation of the domestic terminal (1 and 2) reached P33.15 million.|$|E
25|$|At the <b>check-in</b> <b>counter,</b> passengers' {{passports}} and {{tickets are}} closely examined. A passport without a sticker from the security checkers {{will not be}} accepted. At passport control passengers' names are checked against information from the FBI, Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Scotland Yard, Shin Bet, and Interpol databases. Luggage is screened and sometimes hand searched. In addition, bags are put through a decompression chamber simulating pressures during flight that could trigger explosives. Even at overseas airports, El Al security agents conduct all luggage searches personally, {{even if they are}} supervised by government or private security firms.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{passenger}} terminal (measuring 594,000 square meters) {{is the largest}} airport terminal in area in South Korea. The {{passenger terminal}} was designed by Curtis W. Fentress, FAIA, RIBA of Fentress Architects. It is [...] long, [...] wide, and [...] high. Its construction cost was 1.3816trillion South Korean Won. The terminal has 44 boarding ports (all of which can accommodate the Airbus A380), 50 customs inspection ports, 2 biological quarantine counters, 6 stationary and 14 portable passenger quarantine counters, 120 arrival passport inspection counters, 8 arrival security ports, 28 departure security ports, 252 check in counters, and 120 departure passport inspection counters. In 2015, an automatic <b>check-in</b> <b>counter</b> lane was introduced, where people traveling via Korean Air, Asiana Airlines and China Southern Airlines can use. Instead of having airport staff at the counter, there is a machine where travelers input their flight information, scan their passports, receive their flight tickets and lastly, load the luggage onto the conveyor. This system was planned to be introduced in Terminal 2, but in May 2015 Incheon Airport used one of the counter islands for the unmanned luggage handling system.|$|E
50|$|In October 2008, Bonaire {{introduced}} the new CUTE system from SITA. CUTE stands for Common Use Terminal Equipment.

More flexibility is obtained while the processing capacity of passengers at the <b>check-in</b> <b>counters</b> is increased and made more efficient. The older check-in system worked with so-called dedicated <b>check-in</b> <b>counters</b> which were usable by only one particular airline {{and could not be}} used by other airlines, thus restricting processing capacity.|$|R
