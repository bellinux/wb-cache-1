5|$|Although Mendelssohn {{attributed}} {{great importance}} to musical education, and made a substantial commitment to the <b>Conservatoire</b> he founded in Leipzig, he did not greatly enjoy teaching and took only a very few private pupils who he believed had notable qualities. Amongst such students were the composer William Sterndale Bennett, the pianist Camille-Marie Stamaty, the violinist and composer Julius Eichberg, and Walther von Goethe (grandson of the poet). At the Leipzig <b>Conservatoire</b> Mendelssohn taught classes in composition and ensemble playing.|$|E

5|$|Alkan Morhange {{supported}} {{the family as}} a musician and later as the proprietor of a private music school in le Marais, the Jewish quarter of Paris. At an early age, Charles-Valentin and his siblings adopted their father's first name as their last (and were known by this during their studies at the <b>Conservatoire</b> de Paris and subsequent careers). His brother Napoléon (1826–1906) became professor of solfège at the <b>Conservatoire,</b> his brother Maxim (1818–1897) had a career writing light music for Parisian theatres, and his sister, Céleste (1812–1897), was a singer. His brother Ernest (1816–1876) was a professional flautist, while the youngest brother Gustave (1827–1882) was to publish various dances for the piano.|$|E

5|$|When he {{was nine}} years old Monteux was {{admitted}} to the <b>Conservatoire</b> de Paris. He studied the violin with Jules Garcin and Henri Berthelier, composition with Charles Lenepveu, and harmony and theory with Albert Lavignac. His fellow violin students included George Enescu, Carl Flesch, Fritz Kreisler and Jacques Thibaud. Among the piano students at the <b>Conservatoire</b> was Alfred Cortot, with whom he developed a lifelong friendship. At the age of twelve, Monteux organised and conducted a small orchestra of <b>Conservatoire</b> students to accompany Cortot in performances of concertos in and around Paris. He attended the world premiere of César Franck's Symphony in February 1889. From 1889 to 1892, while still a student, he played in the orchestra of the Folies Bergère; he later said to George Gershwin that his rhythmic sense was formed during the experience of playing popular dance music there.|$|E

5|$|At the <b>Conservatoire</b> Massenet studied solfège with Augustin Savard and {{the piano}} with François Laurent. He pursued his studies, with modest distinction, until the {{beginning}} of 1855, when family concerns disrupted his education. Alexis Massenet's health was poor, and on medical advice he moved from Paris to Chambéry in the south of France; the family, including Massenet, moved with him. Again, Massenet's own memoirs and the researches of his biographers are at variance: the composer recalled his exile in Chambéry as lasting for two years; Henry Finck and Irvine record that the young man returned to Paris and the <b>Conservatoire</b> in October 1855. On his return he lodged with relations in Montmartre and resumed his studies; by 1859 he had progressed so far as to win the Conservatoire's top prize for pianists. The family's finances were no longer comfortable, and to support himself Massenet took private piano students and played as a percussionist in theatre orchestras. His work in the orchestra pit gave him a good working knowledge of the operas of Gounod and other composers, classic and contemporary. Traditionally, many students at the <b>Conservatoire</b> went on to substantial careers as church organists; with that in mind Massenet enrolled for organ classes, but they were not a success and he quickly abandoned the instrument. He gained some work as a piano accompanist, in the course of which he met Wagner who, along with Berlioz, was one of his two musical heroes.|$|E

5|$|Like many {{prominent}} French composers of the period, Massenet {{became a}} professor at the <b>Conservatoire.</b> He taught composition there from 1878 until 1896, when he resigned after the death of the director, Ambroise Thomas.

40|$|Late-nineteenth-century London boasted {{a wealth}} of {{opportunities}} for aspiring professional musicians to gain musical training and employment. Despite this flourishing musical life, however, status as a professional musician was problematic: often associated with immorality, low social status and poor general education, musicians struggled to define themselves as a profession {{in the same way}} that many employment groups had done during the century. The different characters and values of the <b>conservatoires</b> are testimony to such a fragmented profession. This chapter focuses on the definition and function of the <b>conservatoires</b> with respect to contemporary ideas of professionalisation, education and status. In particular, I examine how the <b>conservatoires</b> were compared with the universities in terms of their contributions to professional and social identity, and the problems which complicated their development...|$|R

5|$|Among the enthusiasms of the Apaches was {{the music}} of Debussy. Ravel, twelve years his junior, had known Debussy {{slightly}} since the 1890s, and their friendship, though never close, continued {{for more than ten}} years. In 1902 André Messager conducted the premiere of Debussy's opera Pelléas et Mélisande at the Opéra-Comique. It divided musical opinion. Dubois unavailingly forbade <b>Conservatoire</b> students to attend, and the conductor's friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Saëns was prominent among those who detested the piece. The Apaches were loud in their support. The first run of the opera consisted of fourteen performances: Ravel attended all of them.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} years of the new century, Ravel made five {{attempts}} to win France's most prestigious prize for young composers, the Prix de Rome, past winners of which included Berlioz, Gounod, Bizet, Massenet and Debussy. In 1900 Ravel was eliminated in the first round; in 1901 he won the second prize for the competition. In 1902 and 1903 he won nothing: according to the musicologist Paul Landormy, the judges suspected Ravel of making fun of them by submitting cantatas so academic as to seem like parodies. In 1905 Ravel, by now thirty, competed for the last time, inadvertently causing a furore. He was eliminated in the first round, which even critics unsympathetic to his music, including Lalo, denounced as unjustifiable. The press's indignation grew when it emerged that the senior professor at the <b>Conservatoire,</b> Charles Lenepveu, was on the jury, and only his students were selected for the final round; his insistence that this was pure coincidence was not well received. L'affaire Ravel became a national scandal, leading to the early retirement of Dubois and his replacement by Fauré, appointed by the government to carry out a radical reorganisation of the <b>Conservatoire.</b>|$|E
