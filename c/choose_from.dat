40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} effects of regulatory focus on alternative search and consideration set formation in consumer decision making. Results from three experiments yield two primary findings. First, promotion-focused consumers tend to search for alternatives at a more global level, whereas prevention-focused consumers tend to search for alternatives at a more local level. Second, promotion-focused consumers tend to have larger consideration sets than do prevention-focused consumers. Building on these two primary findings, it is additionally shown that whereas promotion-focused consumers attach relatively greater value to options <b>chosen</b> <b>from</b> hierarchically structured sets, prevention-focused consumers attach relatively greater value to options <b>chosen</b> <b>from</b> nonhierarchically structured item lists. Finally, whereas promotion-focused consumers attach significantly greater value to options <b>chosen</b> <b>from</b> larger sets than to options <b>chosen</b> <b>from</b> smaller sets, prevention-focused consumers do not attach significantly less value to options <b>chosen</b> <b>from</b> larger sets than to options <b>chosen</b> <b>from</b> smaller sets.
