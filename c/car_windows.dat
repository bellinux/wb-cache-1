5|$|Kiarostami's {{style is}} notable {{for the use}} of long shots, such as in the closing {{sequences}} of Life, and Nothing More... and Through the Olive Trees, where the audience is intentionally distanced physically from the characters to invite reflection on their fate. Taste of Cherry is punctuated throughout by shots of this kind, including distant overhead shots of the suicidal Badii's car moving across the hills, usually while he is in conversation with a passenger. The physical distancing techniques stand in juxtaposition to the dialogue, which always remains in the foreground. Like the coexistence of private and public space, or the frequent framing of landscapes through <b>car</b> <b>windows,</b> this fusion of distance with proximity has been seen as a way of generating suspense in the most mundane of moments.|$|E

Main Street was targeted by rioters, according to some of the businesses there. Of those who were arrested for rioting, 70% were not residents of Over-the-Rhine, and 86% were African-American males. The total cost of damage to the city was at least $13.7 million.|$|E
25|$|Going {{into the}} 2011 Championship Cork were the {{defending}} champions after defeating Down in the 2010 final. However, Cork were eliminated in the quarter-finals in 2011 by Mayo. On 30 August 2011, Joe McQuillan was confirmed as the referee for the senior final. This {{was his first}} time to referee an All Ireland Senior Football final. Ahead of the game, Irish politicians Leo Varadkar and Aodhán Ó Ríordáin were censured by officials for flying unauthorised flags from their <b>car</b> <b>windows</b> in public. The flags favoured the Dublin team. After the game, Dublin captain Bryan Cullen was offered the role of coaching Leinster Rugby's academy players.|$|E
25|$|Controversies {{continued}} to dog Dange even after death. In what were supposedly based on KGB documents, notes smuggled out by former KGB spy Vasili Mitrokhin {{at the time}} of his defection to Britain, Christopher Andrew published, in 2005, a book Mitrokhin Archive II, that contained details of alleged transactions between the CPI and the KGB during 1975-76, and it claimed that the money exchanged was between 4 to 8 lakh rupees a month. The supposed KGB papers claim that deceased CPI leaders Dange and C. Rajeswara Rao regularly received bribes and favours from the Russians in the mid-1970s and Dange even issued receipts for the money he received. This money changed hands from <b>car</b> <b>windows</b> in desolate areas near New Delhi, the book claimed.|$|E

25|$|Shahzad is {{believed}} to have bought the 1993 Nissan Pathfinder on April 24, a week prior to the attempted bombing. The vehicle had been listed in an online Craigslist ad, and he reportedly bought it from a female Connecticut college student for $1,300 (negotiated down from $1,800), which he paid in $100 bills. He reportedly exchanged the cash for the car at a Connecticut shopping center parking lot, where he inspected the interior and cargo area (but not the engine) and declined the offer of a bill of sale. He later had the <b>car</b> <b>windows</b> tinted, which made it harder to peer inside. A surveillance tape from the parking lot shows Shahzad test-driving the car, according to the FBI. He bought a second vehicle through Craigslist (a black Isuzu Rodeo) from a mechanic in Stratford, Connecticut.|$|E
25|$|However, Mannerheim and {{his guests}} {{chose to go}} to a car that did not have a {{microphone}} in it. Damen acted quickly, pushing a microphone through one of the <b>car</b> <b>windows</b> to a net shelf just above where Hitler and Mannerheim were sitting. After eleven minutes of Hitler's and Mannerheim's private conversation, Hitler's SS bodyguards spotted the cords coming out of the window and realized that the Finnish engineer was recording the conversation. They gestured to him to stop recording immediately, and he complied. The SS bodyguards demanded that the tape be immediately destroyed; but YLE was allowed to keep the reel, after promising to keep it in a sealed container. It was given to Kustaa Vilkuna, head of the state censors' office, and in 1957 returned to YLE. It was made available to the public a few years later. It is the only known recording of Hitler speaking in an unofficial tone.|$|E

25|$|The Zephyrettes {{made their}} debut on the Denver Zephyr in 1936, and shortly {{thereafter}} {{appeared on the}} Twin Cities Zephyr as well. However, the position was discontinued during World War II, as domestic passenger rail service was reduced to essentially the bare necessities as American railroads tried to conserve resources for the war effort while also providing for the movement of military personnel across the country on troop trains. After {{the end of the}} war, McPeek was instrumental in restoring the Zephyrettes to the Burlington's passenger service, albeit only on the California Zephyr. The Zephyrettes would be a constant presence on the train from 1949 until it was discontinued in 1970. They constituted {{one of a number of}} McPeek's efforts to make the train more friendly to women, children, and families; some of her other ideas were successful, such as lowering the height of <b>car</b> <b>windows</b> to allow for easier viewing, while others were not, such as setting aside a portion of one car for women and children only.|$|E
