5|$|Portable {{ventilators}} may {{be required}} to support breathing. Historically, a noninvasive, negative-pressure ventilator, more commonly called an iron lung, was used to artificially maintain respiration during an acute polio infection until a person <b>could</b> <b>breathe</b> independently (generally about one to two weeks). Today, many polio survivors with permanent respiratory paralysis use modern jacket-type negative-pressure ventilators worn over the chest and abdomen.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte's {{position}} as First Consul was {{strengthened by the}} successful outcome of the battle and the preceding campaign. After this victory, Napoleon <b>could</b> <b>breathe</b> a sigh of relief. The generals who had been hostile to him could see that his luck had not abandoned him. Thus, he had surpassed Schérer, Joubert, Championnet, and even Moreau, none {{of whom had been}} able to inflict a decisive blow on the Coalition. Moreau's victory at Hohenlinden, which was the one that in reality had {{put an end to the}} war, was minimised by Bonaparte who, from then on, would pose as a saviour of the fatherland, and even of the Republic. He rejected offers from Louis XVIII, who had considered the Consulate to be a mere transition towards the restoration of the king. Thanks to the victory at Marengo, Napoleon could finally set about reforming France according to his own vision.|$|E
25|$|The {{experiences}} {{of patients who}} have experienced anesthesia awareness vary widely depending on why they became aware, whether they were paralyzed and patient responses and sequelae vary widely as well. It is unusual for someone having experienced awareness without pain or suffocation to suffer bad sequelae. The experience may be extremely traumatic for the patient {{or not at all}} depending on whether they <b>could</b> <b>breathe</b> and what errors were made.|$|E

25|$|Man from Atlantis was a made-for-TV {{film and}} a {{short-lived}} (1977–1978) series on NBC, created by Mayo Simon and produced by Herbert F. Solow. It starred Patrick Duffy as an amnesiac called Mark Harris, presumably an apparent {{survivor of the}} lost continent of Atlantis, who <b>could</b> <b>breathe</b> underwater and endure the high pressures of the ocean depths. Duffy later wrote a novel based on the series, also titled Man From Atlantis, without known assistance from either Simon or Solow; he intended it to provide his own solutions to the mystery, and {{fill in the gaps}} in the memories, of Mark Harris.|$|E
25|$|The early labyrinthodonts possessed well {{developed}} internal gills {{as well as}} primitive lungs, derived from the swim bladders of their ancestors. They <b>could</b> <b>breathe</b> air, {{which would have been}} a great advantage for residents of warm shoals with low oxygen levels in the water. There was no diaphragma and the ribs in many forms were too short or spaced too closely to aid in expanding the lungs. Likely air was inflated into the lungs by contractions of a throat sac against the skull floor like in modern amphibians, which may be the reason for the retention of the very flat skull in later forms. Exhalation with the aid of the ribs probably evolved only in the line leading to amniotes. Many aquatic forms retained their larval gills in adulthood.|$|E
25|$|Lynam relinquished {{his head}} {{coaching}} position to become general manager following the 1991–92 season, and hired Doug Moe {{to fill the}} vacancy. Moe's tenure lasted just 56 games, with the Sixers posting a 19–37 record. Popular former player and longtime assistant coach Fred Carter succeeded Moe as head coach in March 1993, but could only manage a 32–76 record at the helm. Following the 1993–94 season, the 76ers hired John Lucas in the dual role of head coach and general manager. The enthusiastic Lucas had been successful {{as a head coach}} for the San Antonio Spurs, and Philadelphia hoped he <b>could</b> <b>breathe</b> new life into the 76ers. It proved disastrous, as the team went 42–122 in its two seasons under Lucas. The acquisition of unproductive free agents such as Scott Williams and Charles Shackleford, players {{at the end of their}} careers such as LaSalle Thompson, Orlando Woolridge, and Scott Skiles along with stunningly unwise high draft picks such as Shawn Bradley and Sharone Wright were also factors in the team's decline. In fact, Wright would only play four seasons in the NBA while Temple product Eddie Jones—drafted 4 slots below Wright in 1994 by the L.A. Lakers—had 16 productive seasons as an NBA player.|$|E

500|$|With the {{publication}} of In Patagonia, Chatwin invigorated the genre of travel writing; according to his biographer, Nicholas Murray, he [...] "showed that an inventive writer <b>could</b> <b>breathe</b> new life into an old genre." [...] The combination of his clear yet vivid prose and an international perspective {{at a time when}} many English writers were more focused on home instead of abroad helped to set him apart. Aside from his writing, Chatwin was also good looking, and his image as a dashing traveller added to his appeal and helped make him a celebrity.

In Appendix A of The Lord of the Rings Tolkien mentions a [...] "Cold-drake". [...] It is commonly assumed, though not directly stated, that this term indicates a dragon which cannot breathe fire, rather than one who breathes ice or snow.

2500|$|After Lucheni struck her, the empress collapsed. A coach driver {{helped her}} to her feet and alerted the Austrian {{concierge}} of the Beau-Rivage, a man named Planner, who had been watching the empress's progress toward the Genève. The two women walked roughly [...] to the gangway and boarded, at which point Sztáray relaxed her hold on Elisabeth's arm. The empress then lost consciousness and collapsed next to her. Sztáray called for a doctor, but only a former nurse, a fellow passenger, was available. The boat’s captain, Captain Roux, was ignorant of Elisabeth's identity and since it was very hot on deck, advised the countess to disembark and take her companion back to her hotel. Meanwhile, the boat was already sailing out of the harbor. Three men carried Elisabeth to the top deck and laid her on a bench. Sztáray opened her gown, cut Elisabeth's corset laces so she <b>could</b> <b>breathe.</b> Elisabeth revived somewhat and Sztáray asked her if she was in pain, and she replied, [...] "No".

2500|$|Horrie, an Egyptian terrier, was befriended as a puppy by Australian soldier Private Jim Moody {{when he was}} {{stationed}} in the Ikingi Maryut area of Egypt in 1941.The dog became the unofficial mascot of Moody's unit, the 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion, and followed them as they moved around the Middle East and Greece during their various campaigns. According to the Australian War Memorial, Horrie was described by his owner as being [...] "intelligent and easily trained", and he was employed as an air sentry, alerting troops to approaching enemy aircraft. He was promoted {{to the rank of}} corporal, and during the evacuation of Greece, Horrie was aboard the troopship Costa Rica when it was sunk. He managed to survive, though, and later made it to Crete when he was subsequently wounded by a bomb blast. In 1942, after further service in Syria as part of the Allied garrison, Horrie was brought back to Australia when Moody was repatriated. In order to get around stringent quarantine laws which would have prevented him from bringing Horrie back, Moody smuggled the dog home in a canvas bag, which was reinforced with wooden slats so that the dog <b>could</b> <b>breathe.</b>|$|E

2500|$|By {{wearing a}} tightly-laced corset for {{extended}} periods, known as tightlacing, {{men and women}} can learn to tolerate extreme waist constriction and eventually reduce their natural waist size. Though petite women are often able {{to get down to}} a smaller waist in absolute numbers, women with more fat are typically able to reduce their waists by a larger percentage. Although many different sizes were used, the smallest sizes that were popularly used were 16, 17 and 18 inches. Some women were so tightly laced that they <b>could</b> <b>breathe</b> only with the top part of their lungs. This caused the bottom part of their lungs to fill with mucus. Symptoms of this include a slight but persistent cough, as well as heavy breathing, causing a heaving appearance of the bosom. Until 1998, the Guinness Book of World Records listed Ethel Granger as having the smallest waist on record at [...] After 1998, the category changed to [...] "smallest waist on a living person." [...] Cathie Jung took the title with a waist measuring [...] Other women, such as Polaire, also have achieved such reductions ( [...] in her case). However, these are extreme cases.

2500|$|Giffords {{initially}} {{was placed in}} an induced coma to allow her brain to rest. She was {{able to respond to}} simple commands when periodically awakened, but was unable to speak as she was on a ventilator. Nancy Pelosi said Giffords's husband Mark Kelly acknowledged that there is a [...] "rough road ahead" [...] for his wife's recovery, but was encouraged by her responsiveness, which included the ability to signal with her hand and move both arms. U.S. Army neurologist Geoffrey Ling of the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland, was sent to Tucson to consult on Giffords's condition. Ling stated, [...] "Her prognosis for maintaining the function that she has is very good. It's over 50 percent." [...] On January 11, neurosurgeon G. Michael Lemole Jr. said that Giffords's sedation had been reduced and that she <b>could</b> <b>breathe</b> on her own. On January 12, President Barack Obama visited Giffords at the medical center and publicly stated in an evening memorial ceremony that she had [...] "opened her eyes for the first time" [...] that day. Shortly after the shootings, some questions were raised by the media as to whether Giffords could be removed from office under a state law that allows a public office to be declared vacant if the officeholder is absent for three months, but a spokesperson for the Arizona secretary of state said the statute [...] "doesn't apply to federal offices" [...] and was, therefore, not relevant.|$|E
2500|$|On January 26, 2011 (Australia Day), Buffett was {{performing}} {{a concert in}} Australia at Sydney's Hordern Pavilion and fell off the stage after an encore. A concert-goer said, [...] "He just {{went over to the}} edge of the stage, like he had numerous times through the night, just to wave, and people were throwing stuffed toys and things at him. And he just took one step too many and just disappeared in a flash. He didn't have time to put his arms out to save himself or anything, he just dropped." [...] Coincidentally, one of Australia's leading trauma surgeons was at the concert and close to the stage; Dr. Gordian Fulde treated Buffett at the scene. Fulde said, [...] "I thought he'd broken his neck.... I heard the clunk of his head on a metal ledge, he has a deep gash on his scalp, which is all right now.... But at first I thought: this guy is going to be a spinal injury." [...] Dr Fulde turned him on his side so he <b>could</b> <b>breathe</b> and administered first aid. Buffett regained consciousness within a few minutes. He was then transported to St Vincent's Hospital Emergency centre for treatment and was released the next day. Buffett returned to Australia in 2012 for two shows in Brisbane and Melbourne, and made much fun of the incident during those shows. In the Melbourne show in the historic Palais Theatre in the Melbourne beachside suburb of St. Kilda he presented additional verses of [...] "Margaritaville" [...] in which he made humorous references to the accident, much to the audience's delight.|$|E
