50|$|The high {{complexity}} of the Bornean tropical rain forest has created many niches that accommodate a rich diversity of fauna. Some fauna are specialised and some coexisted by having niche separation to avoid inter- and intra-specific competition within the same habitat. Ecological separation {{can be in the}} form of different feeding guilds, niche separation by stratification and different utilisation strategies by being diurnal or nocturnal. For example, vertebrate fauna (birds and mammals) can be defined into six communities based on vertical stratification of the rainforest. First, the small mammals and birds use the forest ground floor and underground. Second, the large herbivores and carnivorous animals range the ground floor of the forest searching for food, shelter and breed. Third, omnivorous and carnivorous mammals range up and down tree trunk from forest floor to the canopy level. Fourth, are mainly volant mammals such as bats and birds using the middle canopy. Fifth, are top canopy birds and mammals that feed on leaves, fruits, nectar and insects. Sixth, are the fast flying birds and bats using the above <b>canopy</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
50|$|Reflectors {{are often}} used in the lamps to {{maximize}} light efficiency. Plants or lights are moved as close together as possible so that they receive equal lighting and that all light coming from the lamps fall upon the plants. Maximum efficiency {{can be obtained by}} creating a slightly concave canopy such that the periphery and center of the canopy are both at the optimum distance from the light source. Often, the distance between lamp and plant is in the range of 0.6 m with high pressure sodium lamps, to 10 cm with other lamps, such as compact, large and high-output fluorescent lamps. With proper cooling any light type can be moved extremely close to plants to combat the inverse square law, but there are reasons to keep some distance from the canopy regardless of heat concerns; excessive light can cause bleaching of the plant material and the total <b>canopy</b> <b>area</b> contacted by light is decreased as the source is moved closer. Maximum efficiency should be obtained by maximizing the average light intensity (measured in PAR watts) per square foot times the number of square feet of plant matter contacted. Some cannabis cultivators cover the walls of their grow-room with some type of reflective material (often Mylar or Visqueen), or alternatively, white paint to maximize efficiency.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{analyzed}} {{the effects of}} the forest canopy and trunks of a pine stand in the central Spanish Pyrenees on the snow depth (SD) distribution. Using LiDAR technology with a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS), high-resolution data on the SD distribution were acquired during the 2011 - 2012 and 2012 - 2013 snow seasons, which were 2 years having very contrasting climatic and snow accumulation conditions. Average SD evolution in open and <b>canopy</b> <b>areas</b> was characterized. Principal component analysis was applied to identify days having similar spatial patterns of SD distribution. There was a clear contrast in the temporal variability of the snowpack in different areas of the forest stand, corresponding generally to beneath the canopy, and in open sites. The canopy and openings showed markedly different accumulation and melting, with higher snow accumulation found in openings. Differences ranged from 14 to 80 % reduction (average 49 %) in the SD beneath the canopy relative to open sites. The difference in SD between open and <b>canopy</b> <b>areas</b> increased throughout the snow season. The surveyed days were classified in terms of SD distribution, and included days associated with: high SD, low SD, intense melting conditions and periods when the SD distribution was driven by wind conditions.

Vegetation and environmental data were collected on forty-eight 50 cm &# 215; 50 cm plots. Plot cover ranged from 3 to 100 % (1 to 8 species) and most of the cover was from exotic species. In order to explore vegetation patterns the following environmental variables were measured: slope, tree <b>canopy</b> <b>area,</b> bare area, distance from road, and litter thickness. The vegetation data and environmental variables were examined using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA).

Distance from the road affected plant cover but was not related to <b>canopy</b> <b>area,</b> and litter thickness, suggesting that the distance was not a prime determinant on the vegetation pattern a priori. Species richness was the highest in mid-vegetation cover plots, i. e., 40 - 60 %. An exotic plant, Sisymbrium officinale, increased in frequency with a decrease in vegetation cover, and two exotic plant species, Achillea millefolium and Anthoxanthum odoratum, occurred with S. officinale.

One estimate is from the Chinese National Land Cover Data Set (NLCD) generated by a multiyear national land cover project in China through visual interpretation of Landsat thematic mapper (TM) and the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images primarily acquired in the year 2000. The other estimate is the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) standard product (MOD 44 B) from the same year. The two products reveal some common features, but significant discrepancies exist. Detailed analyses are carried out with different land cover types and over different regions. Comparison results show that the difference of the total tree <b>canopy</b> <b>area</b> for the whole country is 159, 000 km 2.

Soil samples were collected under the shrub crown (canopy), at the vertically projected limit of shrub crown margin (periphery), and in the space between shrub crowns (interspace) at two depths, 0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm, to analyze their physical and chemical properties. The results show that the fertile islands of;Tamarix spp. are enriched with more soil nutrients (significantly higher, P 20 cm) and in a larger <b>area</b> (beyond the <b>canopied</b> <b>area)</b> compared to that of H. ammodendron (significantly higher, P < 0. 05, soil nutrients detected only for AN; < 20 cm in depth; smaller than the <b>canopied</b> <b>area).</b> Soil texture patterns surrounding the shrubs of the two species are even more different, with more coarse particles under the Tamarix spp. canopies compared to the interspace between shrubs but fewer under the H. ammodendron canopies compared to the interspaces. These variations are attributed to the difference in morphology of the two studied species: the Y-shaped crowns of H. ammodendron are less capable of capturing and maintaining litter under them than the hemispheroidal crowns of Tamarix spp., which leads to the less well developed fertile islands surrounding H. ammodendron shrubs.
