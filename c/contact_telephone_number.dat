OBJECTIVES: The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore how many Advanced Midwives who graduated between 2000 and 2004 are still working in public sector facilities. The second objective was to determine of those working in the public sector, how many are still ding clinical works in maternity wards. The third objective was to explore the reasons why the Advanced Midwives who left did and where they had gone to followed by the fourth objective which was to explore the reasons why those who stayed back did, the fifth objective was to see whether age, level of facility, rural or urban and province impacted on whether they have remained in the facility and the Sixth objective was to document the recommendations given by the Advanced Midwives on how to keep Advanced Midwives using heir skill in the public sector. STUDY POPULATION: Graduates of Chris Hani Baragwanath nursing college and the University of Johannesburg nursing college for a period of five years 2000 to 2004 METHODS: Following Ethics approval, the two nursing colleges were approached to give the contact details of their graduates between 2000 and 2004. All the advanced Midwives who graduated within these years from the two nursing colleges totaling 320 graduates were communicated with. While some of the advanced midwives whose <b>contact</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>numbers</b> were available were communicated with telephonically, other advanced midwives who had no <b>contact</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>numbers</b> were forwarded the questionnaires by post, including a formal letter containing full explanation of the purpose of the research and the confidentiality of the information they were asked to give.

40|$|Background: Laboratory request forms provide {{information}} about the laboratory test being requested for. They carry demographic data and other information such as location of patient, laboratory number, doctor’s name, signature of the doctor, telephone number of the requesting doctor. Omission {{of information on the}} forms may lead to laboratory errors. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the level of completion of laboratory request forms at the haematology department of a Ghanaian tertiary hospital. Methods: Three thousand request forms submitted to the haematology department between January and April 2010 were retrieved and studied. The information provided on each request form was recorded in a spread sheet and analyzed. Results: The patient’s age and sex were missing in 25. 6 % and 32. 7 % of the forms respectively. About half of the request forms did not have the patient’s location. No clinical detail was provided on 22. 7 % of the forms. Doctors were more likely to sign their request forms and provide a name but they all failed to provide an address or a <b>contact</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>number.</b> Conclusion: This study demonstrates that, the standard of completion of request forms was poor. Essential information required on the forms was often missing. This can lead to limited advice given by laboratory physicians and may increase the potential for errors. Conversely, provision of all the information needed on the forms will aid laboratory diagnosis and enhance patient care and save time and resources. There should be closer interaction between clinicians and laboratory personnel to improve quality of services...|$|E
40|$|Presented at Society of Hospital Medicine, 03 / 25 / 2104, Las Vegas, NV. Background: New Mexico is {{geographically}} large, {{rural and}} medically underserved. Thirty of New Mexico’s 33 counties are designated as Medically Underserved Areas and Health Professions Shortage Areas. Many New Mexico patients are transferred from urban hospitals to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), often {{in other parts}} of the state. When compared to all states using the 2012 Leapfrog Composite Safety Score for U. S. Hospitals ratings, New Mexico ranked last (50 of 50 states) in overall hospital patient safety. Purpose: The Hospitalist Committee of the New Mexico Chapter of the American College of Physicians recruited a volunteer working group of 20 hospitalists, medical directors, patient safety officers, nurses and resident physicians from across the state to develop at least one intervention designed to improve patient safety in New Mexico hospitals. Description: The group participated in monthly conference calls. After discussing ideas about interventions to improve hospital patient safety and how to implement them, the group agreed to focus on developing a state-wide form to facilitate transfer of important clinical information to providers who receive patients at SNFs from New Mexico hospitals. Subgroups reviewed forms used across the state and developed and conducted a survey of Medical Directors of New Mexico SNFs. The group used a free internet wiki-site to post documents and share information. The group reviewed five New Mexico hospital transfer forms that were currently in use. Eighteen separate elements were identified on these forms, none of which were common to all 18 forms. New Mexico SNF Medical Directors completed an anonymous voluntary internet-based survey. Frequent concerns expressed by the surveyed directors included receipt of too much superfluous information; frequent lack of important clinical care items (code status, decisional capacity, weight-bearing status, end date of antibiotics, anticipated duration of anticoagulant therapy, recommendations for follow-up appointments, and name of the patient’s primary care provider); and lack of a direct <b>contact</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>number</b> of the referring provider. Using the survey results and a review of the existing forms, the group drafted and approved a one-page state-wide transfer form which has now been made available to the 32 hospitals in New Mexico. The project was completed in eight months with 6 conference calls at a total cost of less than $ 400. Conclusions: Using cross-state collaborations, voluntary professional time, conference calls and a wiki-site, this low-cost project produced a state-wide transfer form designed to enhance safer transitions of care in a large rural state...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Response {{rates in}} surveys have been falling {{over the last}} 20 years, leading {{to the need for}} novel {{approaches}} to enhance recruitment. This study describes strategies used to maximise recruitment to a home interview survey of mothers with young children living in areas of high deprivation. Methods Mothers of two year old children received a letter from their GP inviting them {{to take part in a}} survey on diet. Participants were subsequently recruited by a researcher. The researcher first tried to contact potential participants by telephone, to discuss the study and make an appointment to conduct a home interview. Where <b>telephone</b> <b>numbers</b> for women could not be obtained from GP records, web searches of publicly available databases were conducted. After obtaining correct <b>telephone</b> <b>numbers,</b> up to six attempts were made to establish <b>contact</b> by <b>telephone.</b> If this was unsuccessful, a postal request for <b>telephone</b> <b>contact</b> was made. Where no <b>telephone</b> <b>contact</b> was achieved, the researcher sent up to two appointments by post to conduct a home interview. Results Participating GPs invited 372 women to take part in a home based interview study. GP practices provided <b>telephone</b> <b>numbers</b> for 162 women, of which 134 were valid numbers. The researcher identified a further 187 numbers from electronic directories. Further searches of GP records by practice staff yielded another 38 <b>telephone</b> <b>numbers.</b> Thus, <b>telephone</b> <b>numbers</b> were obtained for 99 % of potential participants. The recruitment rate from <b>telephone</b> <b>contacts</b> was 77 %. Most of the gain was achieved within four calls. For the remaining women, contact by post and home visits resulted in 18 further interviews, corresponding to 35 % of the women not recruited by telephone. The final interview rate was 82 %. This was possible because personal contact was established with 95 % of potential participants. Conclusion This study achieved a high response rate in a hard to reach group. This was mainly achieved by first establishing <b>contact</b> by <b>telephone.</b> The use of multiple sources identified the <b>telephone</b> <b>numbers</b> of almost all the sample. Multiple attempts at <b>telephone</b> <b>contact</b> followed by postal approaches led to a high home interview rate. </p...|$|R
