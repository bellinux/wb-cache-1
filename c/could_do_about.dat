5|$|Jim avidly {{read the}} Liverpool Echo or Express, liked solving crosswords and instigated discussions about varied subjects. His {{attitude}} to life {{was based upon}} self-respect, perseverance, fairness and a strong work ethic. His political views were far from left-wing, as he insisted {{that there was nothing}} anyone <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> the situation the working classes were in at the time, and nothing would ever change.|$|E
25|$|The defeat {{caused a}} great shift in policy {{for many other}} states, as well. States which had until now been neutral joined with Sparta, {{assuming}} that Athens's defeat was imminent. Many of Athens' allies in the Delian League also revolted, and although the city immediately began to rebuild its fleet, there was little they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> the revolts for the time being. The expedition and consequent disaster left Athens reeling. Some 10,000 hoplites had perished and, though this was a blow, the real concern was {{the loss of the}} huge fleet dispatched to Sicily. Triremes could be replaced, but the 30,000 experienced oarsmen lost in Sicily were irreplaceable and Athens had to rely on ill-trained slaves to form the backbone of her new fleet.|$|E
25|$|In America, as had {{happened}} with H.M.S. Pinafore, the first productions were unauthorised, but once D'Oyly Carte's American production opened in August 1885, {{it was a}} success, earning record profits, and Carte formed several companies to tour the show in North America. Burlesque and parody productions, including political parodies, were mounted. About 150 unauthorised versions cropped up, and, as had {{been the case with}} Pinafore, there was nothing that Carte or Gilbert and Sullivan <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it, since there was no copyright treaty at the time. In Australia, The Mikados first authorised performance was on 14 November 1885 at the Theatre Royal, Sydney, produced by J. C. Williamson. During 1886, Carte was touring five Mikado companies in North America.|$|E

500|$|Barbirolli's first {{reason for}} leaving was local musical politics. He later said, [...] "The Musicians Union there... {{brought out a}} new {{regulation}} saying that everyone, even soloists and conductors, must become members. Horowitz, Heifetz and the rest were shocked by this {{but there was little}} they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it. They also said that conductors must become American citizens. I couldn't do that during the war, or at any time for that matter." [...] His second reason for leaving was that he felt strongly that he was needed in England. In the spring of 1942 he made a hazardous Atlantic crossing: ...|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Benn reiterated his {{opposition}} to the European Commission and highlighted an alleged democratic deficit in the institution, saying: [...] "Some people genuinely believe that we shall never get social justice from the British Government, but we shall get it from Jacques Delors. They believe that a good king is better than a bad Parliament. I have never taken that view." [...] This argument has also been used by many on the right-wing Eurosceptic wing of the Conservative Party, such as Daniel Hannan MEP. Jonathan Freedland writes in The Guardian that [...] "For , even benign rule by a monarch was worthless because the king's whim could change and there'd be nothing you <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|Irvine {{scored the}} first {{points for the}} Jaguar team in the race, having failed to score up to that point. He {{described}} the race {{as one of the}} hardest in his Formula One career as his drink bottle did not function correctly along with suffering a blistered foot. He also said that the team's issues were not fully rectified and it would take [...] "six months or so to solve... hopefully we can do it quicker." [...] Salo said that his hands were bruised during the race as his car had no power steering equipped. Michael Schumacher admitted to feeling disappointed after the race, having led the majority of the race until his lap 56 retirement. He stated: [...] "The exhaust was too hot and that was why the rest went wrong. It basically cooked the suspension. I felt a few laps before that something was wrong but there was nothing I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{catalyst}} {{for the development of}} Whiteside's philosophy was the realisation that, as she wrote,"...the pupils in my studio played or didn't play, and that was that. The talented ones progressed, the others didn't--and I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> nothing <b>about</b> it." ...|$|R
500|$|The Cubs hired Leo Durocher {{as manager}} in 1966, hoping he could inspire renewed {{interest}} in the team's fan base. Banks hit only 15 home runs; Cubs finished the 1966 season in last place with a 59–103 win-loss record, the worst season of Durocher's career. From the time Durocher arrived in Chicago, he was frustrated at his inability to trade or bench the aging Banks. In Durocher's autobiography, he says:... was a great player in his time. Unfortunately, his time wasn't my time. Even more unfortunately, {{there was not a}} thing I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it. He couldn't run, he couldn't field; toward the end, he couldn't even hit. There are some players who instinctively do the right thing on the base paths. Ernie had an unfailing instinct for doing the wrong thing. But I had to play him. Had to play the man or {{there would have been a}} revolution in the street." ...|$|E
500|$|Stan Love, Wilson's {{cousin and}} band manager, fired Landy in December 1976 when Landy doubled his fee. Landy remembered 15 Big Ones as [...] "the only major success" [...] the Beach Boys had in recent years; [...] "Brian and I did that together. Right after that, I {{had to leave}} the situation. ... I was {{interested}} in making Brian a whole human being; they [...] were interested in getting another album done in time for 1977." [...] In 1977, Wilson was asked if Landy had too much control; he said, [...] "I thought so, but there was nothing I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it and I eventually gave in to it.... control of my life legally through the commitment of my wife.... He definitely helped me. It cost over a hundred thousand dollars – he charged {{a hell of a lot}} per month." [...] Wilson then reported that Landy was replaced with a new doctor, Steve Schwartz. After several sessions with Wilson, Schwartz died in a camping accident, falling off a mountain to his death.|$|E
500|$|On September 14, 2008, Hochuli officiated a {{game between}} the San Diego Chargers and the Denver Broncos. He made an {{incorrect}} call with 1:17 left in the game, while Denver was in possession of the ball at the San Diego one-yard line and they were trailing the Chargers by seven points. On a second-down play, Denver quarterback Jay Cutler fumbled the ball, and it was recovered by San Diego linebacker Tim Dobbins. Ed Hochuli blew his whistle during the play, signaling that the play was dead and ruling an incomplete pass. Hochuli later wrote, [...] "Affecting {{the outcome of a}} game is a devastating feeling. Officials strive for perfection – I failed miserably." [...] The NFL passed a rule the following offseason allowing such plays to be reviewable under the instant replay rule for the 2009 NFL season. Speaking to Referee in November 2009, Hochuli told the magazine, [...] "It was really an easy play. I’ve thought many times why I did what I did. The best explanation is it was almost like dyslexia. I realized it was a fumble and did the wrong thing. I realized I was wrong but there was nothing I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E

500|$|The play's premiere {{and initial}} run were mostly {{critically}} acclaimed. The religious community's {{reviews of the}} initial run were also positive. After the first performances in 2011, Louis Hobson of the Calgary Sun said the character of Marta was an unrealistic caricature and didn't [...] "ring true" [...] because of how she was written. The character underwent a series of rewrites to make her more well-rounded and kind before the 2012 cross-Canada tour. In the 2012 tour, the play was performed in several fringe theatre festivals, at which critics representing the Montreal Gazette, the Winnipeg Free Press, and CFEQ-FM said it stood out for its quality and moral content. The writing was praised by one critic from the Victoria News, who wrote that the play demonstrates that Kooman has a [...] "gift for creating powerful, believable dialogue that can draw an audience in", but criticised by Chamberlain of the Times Colonist, who attested to [...] "melodramatic—and just plain bad—cop-show dialogue". Liz Nicholls of the Edmonton Journal called the performances compelling. Karen Nelson, also of the Edmonton Journal, called the play [...] "sobering" [...] {{in such a way}} that she was caused [...] "to wonder what [...] <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> this global epidemic of abuse of children, women and the disenfranchised." ...|$|E
2500|$|Watts (1674–1748), {{whose father}} was an Elder of a {{dissenter}} congregation, complained at age 16, that when allowed only psalms to sing, the faithful could not even sing about their Lord, Christ Jesus. [...] His father invited him {{to see what he}} <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it; [...] the result was Watts' first hymn, [...] "Behold the glories of the Lamb".|$|E

The early AA got its ideas of self-examination, acknowledgment of character defects, restitution for harm done, and working with others straight from the Oxford Group and directly from Sam Shoemaker, their former leader in America, and from nowhere else." ...|$|E

"What {{they had}} against us was that I had taken {{classes at the}} Actors Lab in Hollywood {{where some of the}} {{teachers}} were from the Group Theater and therefore suspect, and we had been members of the Hollywood Writers Mobilization, an organization in support of World [...] War II to which almost all of Hollywood's writers belonged. It was ridiculous, but it was very real, and there was nothing we <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it. We took a larger mortgage on the house and started writing a play, but we didn't work in films for almost two years." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the seventh}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Laban {{answered}} Jacob {{that they were}} his daughters, his children, and his flocks, but asked what he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it now. Instead, Laban proposed that they make a covenant, and Jacob set up a stone pillar and with his kin heaped stones, and they ate a meal by the heap. Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. Laban called the heap as a witness between him and Jacob, and invoked God to watch, when they were apart, if Jacob would afflict Laban's daughters and take other wives. And Laban designated the heap and the pillar as a boundary between him and Jacob; Laban would not pass over it to Jacob, and Jacob would not pass over it to Laban, to do harm. Laban invoked the God of Abraham, the God of Nahor, and the God of Terah, and Jacob swore by the Fear of Isaac and offered a sacrifice.|$|E
2500|$|Before the 2004 NBA draft, Gordon {{thought that}} he would be drafted {{anywhere}} from 7th to 12th, but as the draft got closer he claimed to have an inkling that the Bulls might draft him third as they did with Michael Jordan 20 years earlier in the 1984 NBA draft. [...] "I'm a guy who looks at the significance of numbers a lot. Before the draft, I had no idea I'd get drafted third. I thought I was going to go anywhere from 7th to 12th. As we started getting closer and I started to get an inkling that the Bulls could be a team that I could end up playing for, I started to look at the numbers. Michael Jordan was drafted by the Bulls and he was the third pick just like you." [...] Gordon wore the number 4 on his jersey in high school and college, but had to wear the number 7 with the Bulls due to the number 4 being retired. Gordon said, [...] "I wore No. 4 my whole career but, of course, Jerry Sloan already had that number beforehand so there wasn't much I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it. So all I did was just [...] being the third pick with my old No. 4. That's why I wear No. 7." [...] The Bulls also acquired Luol Deng in the same draft.|$|E
