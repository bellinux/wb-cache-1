50|$|When the RNA {{transcript}} reaches 7 nucleotides long, transcription {{enters the}} elongation phase, {{the beginning of}} which is characterised by the collapsing of the DNA bubble and the ejection of TFIIB.

5|$|In 1929, Edward Bernays {{helped the}} Lucky Strike {{cigarette}} brand increase its sales among the female demographic.

Bernays persuaded fashion designers, charity events, interior designers and others to popularize the color green. He also positioned cigarettes as Torches of Freedom that represent rebellion against the norms of a male-dominated society.|$|E
