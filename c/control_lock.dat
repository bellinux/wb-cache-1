Briggs, Scott, and the remaining crew use the use the opportunity to leave in escape pods. They try to convince Adric to come, but at the last moment he returns, having another insight on defeating the lock. Scott relays their status to the TARDIS, and the Cyberleader orders the Cybermen to kill the TARDIS crew, but the Doctor smashes Adric's badge on the Cyberleader's chestplate, momentarily stunning it and allowing them to disable the Cybermen.|$|E

In this paper we show how such locks can be used for concurrency control, without introducing covert channels. 1. Introduction A database system is a software system that provides a collection of predefined operations with three features: 1) efficient management of large amounts of persistent data (the database), 2) transaction management for transactions composed of those operations on the data (concurrency control, atomicity, and recovery from failure), and 3) a data model that provides a simple abstraction for understanding how the predefined operations and data interact.

40|$|Many {{problems}} {{that appear in}} different contexts are conceptually similar and so are amenable to solution by a common technique. Three such technical Information Systems (IS) problems are: (1) segmentation of computer programs; (2) attribute discretization for decision tree induction; and (3) design of hash tables in database systems. In this paper we show how each of these seemingly different problems can be formulated as a sequential (set) partitioning problem, and solved using a parametric linear programming (LP) procedure. This approach provides optimal solutions unlike previous solution approaches which were either greedy heuristics or limited to solving only a specific problem situation. Given the likelihood that other applications of the sequential partitioning problem exist in IS, the material presented here could be useful to other researchers in formulating the problem at an appropriate level of abstraction so that available optimal solution approaches can be identified. In addition to providing a common solution method, parametric LP frees the user from having to make premature decisions regarding the number of groups for the partition, and this decision can be delayed post solution.

40|$|When writing {{parallel}} {{programs for}} shared memory machines, {{it is common}} to use shared data structures (linked lists, queues, trees, etc.). Concurrency control for such data structures may be implemented using either blocking or non-blocking/lock-free synchronization. Blocking synchronization is popular because it is familiar and also amenable to worst-case performance analysis (important for certain real time applications). Unfortunately it also suffers from some undesirable characteristics. These include the possibility of deadlock, limited concurrency since processes are blocked, and certain scheduling anomalies. Non-blocking techniques, though less prevalent, do not suffer from these problems and as such may be well suited to many parallel programming problems. Despite increased interest in non-blocking techniques, even simple data structures such as singly linked lists often have annoying limitations. This paper presents a new implementation of non-blocking linked lists which overcomes some common problems with existing implementations. In addition to offering greater overall concurrency, the presented technique also significantly increases performance for long linked lists. We provide algorithms for list traversal, insertion and removal, show their correctness, and also analyze the results of a simulation study which compares the performance of our implementation against two existing techniques under varying load conditions and access patterns and for various list lengths.
