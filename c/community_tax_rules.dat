In particular, <b>tax</b> <b>rules</b> may prevent the proposal of inefficient projects which benefit only a small lobby group. We propose “redistribution efficiency ” as a socially desirable property of proposals and find that <b>tax</b> <b>rules</b> always guarantee redistribution efficiency. We show that rules on subsidies com-bined with discretion regarding taxes always yield socially inferior proposals.

40|$|The Ramsey {{approach}} to optimal taxation and Ramsey <b>tax</b> <b>rules</b> have amassed substance in economic theory. However, {{they are often}} criticized on grounds of practicality, fairness, feasibility and some other aspects of designing actual tax policy. This paper presents a collection of these views; it discusses how closely or remotely Ramsey rules are followed in designing tax policy. It presents some recent tax reforms in the US and in the UK that have closely, if not completely, followed the principle of distortion minimization. Despite the widely speculated difficulty associated with mapping normative <b>tax</b> <b>rules</b> into positive policy design, {{it is possible to}} implement taxes that have strong correspondence to Ramsey tax formulas. This paper also discusses why some implemented <b>tax</b> <b>rules</b> lack consistency with Ramsey principles, or why {{it is often difficult to}} establish correspondence between some implemented taxes and Ramsey <b>tax</b> <b>rules.</b> [...] Optimal Taxation,Policy Relevance,Ramsey <b>Tax</b> <b>Rules...</b>|$|R

In this paper the exemption, credit and deduction method are considered as <b>tax</b> <b>rules.</b> First, it is shown that under the exemption method there exist tax rate combinations that lead to a reversal of capital flows compared to a free-trade situation. Second, the decision on the <b>tax</b> <b>rule</b> and the corporate tax rate is endogenized as outcome in a non-cooperative game. All <b>tax</b> <b>rules</b> lead to the same inefficient outcome. Therefore, for each <b>tax</b> <b>rule</b> we analyze the conditions for Pareto-improving tax cooperation.

40|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>rules</b> in non-tax {{agreements}} is a {{topic of}} great relevance in practice. Yet, up to now, this area of tax law has been generally neglected by researchers. The aim of this book is to close this gap in tax law research and to analyse the provisions of international agreements and similar legal instruments under international law which provide for a special domestic law tax treatment for specific individuals and international organizations. Twenty-four national reports from countries across the globe have been compiled and are published in this volume. Seventy experts, including {{the authors of the}} national reports, convened for a joint conference on "Tax Rules in Non-Tax Agreements" in Rust (Austria) from 7 - 9 July 2011. The national reports focus on the interaction of <b>tax</b> <b>rules</b> in non-tax agreements with the corresponding <b>tax</b> treaty <b>rules.</b> Moreover, possible matters of dispute regarding the justification of these <b>tax</b> <b>rules</b> within the legal and political frameworks of the different states are given much attention. The objective of this book is to show the relevance of <b>tax</b> <b>rules</b> in non-tax agreements, to highlight problematic issues and to encourage future research in this important field of tax law.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the empirical analyses of optimal taxation, adopting Equality of Outcome (EO) as well as Equality of Opportunity (EOp) as evaluation criteria. The EOp- and EO-criteria provide alternative methods for summarizing the efficiency-equality trade-off in the distribution of individual welfare. We also compare the results depending on whether we use income or money-metric utility as a measure of individual welfare. We estimate micro-econometric models of household labour supply and corresponding individual welfare measures based on 1995 Norwegian data for both married couples and singles. We then use these models to simulate behavioural responses and welfare gains and losses of various constant-revenue four-parameter <b>tax</b> <b>rules,</b> i. e. the <b>tax</b> <b>rules</b> defined by a lump-sum transfer (positive or negative), two marginal tax rates and a “kink point” that produces the same revenue collected with the observed 1995 rules.

Theoretical {{models and}} empirical tests of hypotheses {{in this area}} should play a much larger role than currently in the modern theory of corporate finance. Employees fund {{a large proportion of}} their firm's activities through deferred compensation arrangements tied to the performance of their company. These arrangements are generally put in place for incentive reasons, to align the interests of employees more closely with those of shareholders. Moreover, <b>tax</b> <b>rules</b> encourage or discourage these arrangements at various times. Currently, both <b>tax</b> <b>rules</b> and incentive considerations encourage stock buyback programs to fund deferred compensation arrangements. Prior to the 1980 s, however, <b>tax</b> <b>rules</b> favored funding in other than company stock, implying that employees likely held company stock for incentive and not for tax reasons during this time period.
