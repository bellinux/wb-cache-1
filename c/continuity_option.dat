It is much harder to make a reputation or a splash in the ideas pool by arguing that nothing much has changed. Let's call this the <b>continuity</b> <b>option.</b> Since the early 1980 s the big picture franchise has passed to and through a variety of paradigm break theories. We have moved from and through flexible specialization, new production concepts, lean production, post-Fordism, postmodernization, and lately the knowledge economy. While there have, of course, been variations in these perspectives, we can also observe a number of common themes. The argument of this article is that while model building necessarily tends to overstate system cohesiveness, there are powerful structural tendencies, driven by developments in capital markets, which are exacerbating disunity between these different domains. Within modern capitalism economic actors are finding it increasingly difficult to 'make connections' between objectives in the spheres of work and employment, and simultaneously employers are finding it harder to keep their side of any bargain with employees...|$|E

The volatility {{is assumed to}} be an arbitrary strictly positive bounded function of time. We establish several continuity estimates for the American option value process, the optimal hedging portfolio and the corresponding consumption process with respect to volatility function. © 2008 Bull.

40|$|Der in der Transcript-Reihe Sozialtheorie erschienene Sammelband von Iris DZUDZEK, Caren KUNZE und Joscha WULLWEBER kann als Versuch gesehen werden, materialistische Gesellschaftskritik mit poststrukturalistischer Theorie zu verbinden. Dabei wird insbesondere auf GRAMSCIs Hegemonieverständnis und LACLAU und MOUFFEs Diskurstheorie zurückgegriffen. Neben dem unbestreitbaren Verdienst, die Kontinuitäten und Synthesemöglichkeiten beider Perspektiven herauszuarbeiten, lassen die Beiträge noch viel Raum für Kritik und politische Einmischung, die die HerausgeberInnen ankündigen, und ebenso für methodologische Fragen der Umsetzung.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{methods for}} relating {{the prices of}} discrete- and continuous-time versions of path-dependent options sensitive to extremal values of the underlying asset, including lookback, barrier, and hindsight options. The relationships {{take the form of}} correction terms that can be interpreted as shifting a barrier, a strike, or an extremal price. These correction terms enable us to use closed-form solutions for continuous option prices to approximate their discrete counterparts. We also develop discrete-time discrete-state lattice methods for determining accurate prices of discrete and continuous path-dependent options. In several cases, the lattice methods use correction terms based on the connection between discrete- and continuous-time prices which dramatically improve convergence to the accurate price.

40|$|Objective follow-through {{experiences}} (which enable midwifery {{students to}} experience {{continuity of care}} with individual women through pregnancy, labour and birth and the postnatal period) are a component of midwifery education programmes in Australia and the United Kingdom. Current accreditation standards in Australia require midwifery students to have a total of 20 continuity of care experiences {{with an average of}} 20 hours per woman over the duration of their course. There has been limited research regarding students’ and academics’ experiences of follow-through experiences; and there has been debate regarding the appropriate number of follow-through experiences in midwifery curricula. This study aimed to explore the follow-through experience from the perspective of midwifery students and academics in Victoria, Australia. Design cross-sectional design using a web-based survey. Setting Victoria, Australia. Participants students (n= 401) and academics (n= 35) from all seven universities in Victoria that offer accredited midwifery programmes including the Bachelor of Midwifery, Bachelor of Nursing/Bachelor of Midwifery double degree, Postgraduate Diploma of Midwifery and Masters of Midwifery (entry to practice). Findings students and academics were in agreement that continuity of care is important to women. They considered the follow-through experience to be a unique and valuable learning opportunity and agreed that follow-through experiences should be included in midwifery education programmes. However, students and academics raised major concerns about the impact of follow-through experiences on students’ capacity to meet university course requirements (such as missing lectures/tutorials and clinical placements), and spending extensive periods of time on-call both within and outside the university semester. Students and academics also reported concerns about the impact of follow-through experiences on students’ personal lives, including paid employment and family responsibilities (such as childcare or caring for family members). Key conclusions and implications for practice in settings where <b>continuity</b> of care <b>options</b> for women are relatively limited, prescriptive requirements regarding the number and hours of follow-through experiences can present significant challenges for midwifery students. Midwifery regulatory bodies should consider these findings when developing or revising standards for midwifery education...|$|R
