5|$|The Lord Nelsons were {{notoriously}} {{difficult for}} inexperienced <b>crews</b> <b>to</b> fire properly, {{due to their}} long firebox, and specific crews who had proven experience in firing the locomotives were therefore allocated to them. This {{was due to the}} relatively few locomotives in the class for <b>crews</b> <b>to</b> train on. The LMS Royal Scot Class was loosely based on this design.|$|E
5|$|Salyut 6 was {{primarily}} {{supported by the}} manned Soyuz spacecraft, which carried out crew rotations and would also {{have been used in}} the event of an emergency evacuation. The ferries docked automatically to the station, making use of the new Igla automatic docking system, and were used by departing <b>crews</b> <b>to</b> return to Earth at the end of their flight.|$|E
5|$|Air-landing {{obstacles}} {{were not}} the only tactic Rommel used against aerial invaders. Rommel ordered the flooding of some fields so that glider troops and paratroops landing in the water would drown. He ordered machine gun <b>crews</b> <b>to</b> cover the exits of fields that were bounded by bocage—tall, dense hedgerows—so that glider infantry and paratroopers would come under fire as they moved out of their landing area. The bocage hedgerows themselves were the worse hazard to safe glider landings, and caused more glider casualties than Rommelspargel.|$|E

50|$|According to {{director}} Steve Carver, Angie Dickinson {{allowed the}} <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> remain on set {{during the filming}} of her sex scene with Tom Skerritt, but William Shatner asked for all nonessential <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> be removed during his sex scene with Dickinson.|$|R
5000|$|On 16 September 1971 a Tu-134 of Malev on {{approach}} to Kiev suffered a generator failure that forced the <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> switch to batteries for power supply. The foggy weather then forced the <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> abort two approaches. Upon landing, the Tupolev crashed and broke up. There were 41 passenger fatalities and 8 amongst the crew, with no survivors.|$|R
5|$|China's late-20th-century {{economic}} reforms produced {{a middle class}} that increased demand for traditional luxury items like shark fins. Chinese traditional medicine ascribes various restorative and healing effects to the fins, and the soup is considered a delicacy, costing as much as US$100 per bowl. The Chinese demand for fins led fishing <b>crews</b> <b>to</b> both take them from sharks in their bycatch and start fishing for sharks directly.|$|E
5|$|Firefighting {{operations}} were resumed at about 20:00, {{and it was}} anticipated that all fires could be extinguished during the night. Further damage occurred {{to one of the}} storage tanks {{in the early hours of}} Tuesday morning, causing firefighters to be withdrawn once again, but operations resumed at 08:30. By midday on 13 December, all but three fires had been extinguished, although the largest tank was still burning. Bronze commandoperations on the groundwas visited by the Bishop of St Albans, the local vicar, and the industrial chaplain supporting the fire <b>crews,</b> <b>to</b> see how they were coping.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} of {{transition}} to war, the V Bomber squadrons were to deploy four aircraft at short notice to each of 26 pre-prepared dispersal airfields around the United Kingdom. In the early 1960s the RAF ordered 20 Beagle Basset communication aircraft to move the <b>crews</b> <b>to</b> dispersal airfields; {{the importance of these}} aircraft was only brief, diminishing when the primary nuclear deterrent switched to the Royal Navy's Polaris Missile.|$|E
5000|$|This {{mission was}} to carry the Expedition 7 <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> the ISS and bring home the Expedition 6 crew. The {{original}} <b>crew</b> was <b>to</b> be: ...|$|R
50|$|STS-113 {{delivered}} the Expedition 6 <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> the station for a four-month increment. The Expedition 5 <b>crew</b> returned <b>to</b> Earth aboard STS-113, ending an 185-day stay in space.|$|R
5000|$|In-flight {{rostering}} involves assigning the <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> {{specific tasks}} at specific {{times during the}} flight so that {{other members of the}} crew have time for activity breaks and bunk sleep. This allows well-rested <b>crew</b> members <b>to</b> be used during the critical phases of flight. Further research will need to show the optimal number of crew members sufficient for a well rested operating <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> operate the flight safely.|$|R
5|$|On 18 November, the British Admiralty, {{released}} a report that listed all of UB-43s first five victims as evidence of German wrongdoing. According to the British report, Italiana, Dewa, Lord Tredegar, and Elax—four of the twenty-two ships listed—had all been torpedoed without warning. This type of attack was counter to German pledges to adhere cruiser warfare, which required that ships be allowed time for the <b>crews</b> <b>to</b> escape before any attack could commence. UB-43s fifth victim, Welsh Prince, was on another list of 107 British ships sunk whose lifeboats had been fired upon by German submarines.|$|E
5|$|Overwatch {{announcement}} video, in 2014, {{contained a}} stray {{reference to a}} gauntlet. Following its obsessive popularity with fans, the developer, Blizzard Entertainment, expanded the gauntlet into a full-fledged, playable character. This period included a series of teasers from the developer and a campaign by actor Terry <b>Crews</b> <b>to</b> voice the character. Doomfist was ultimately voiced by Sahr Ngaujah. In Doomfist's fictional backstory, the playable character became the third generation to wield the gauntlet, and {{is presented as a}} villain after killing his predecessor and becoming a leader of Talon, the game's nemesis group. A digital comic accompanied the character's release.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} {{began on}} the morning of 12 October, when Moltke and the III Squadron ships engaged Russian positions in Tagga Bay while Friedrich der Grosse and the rest of IV Squadron shelled Russian gun batteries on the Sworbe Peninsula on Ösel. The coastal artillery in both locations were quickly silenced by the battleships' heavy guns. On the morning of the 14th, Friedrich der Grosse, Kaiserin, and König Albert were detached to support German troops advancing toward Anseküll. The three ships fired on the battery at Zerel for an hour, which prompted most of the Russian gun <b>crews</b> <b>to</b> flee their posts.|$|E

50|$|On 24 May 1907, Centurion {{transferred}} her <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> battleship HMS Exmouth. On 25 May 1907, she recommissioned {{with a new}} nucleus <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> {{serve as}} a special service vessel with the Portsmouth Division of the Home Fleet. By April 1909, {{she was part of}} the 4th Division, Home Fleet, at Portsmouth.|$|R
50|$|As {{all of the}} ship's {{anti-aircraft}} {{weapons were}} by now knocked out, Captain Bruun ordered his <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> abandon ship. The entire surviving <b>crew</b> managed <b>to</b> get ashore without any further casualties.|$|R
5|$|Union troops retreated in {{different}} states of order. The brigades on Seminary Ridge {{were said to}} move deliberately and slowly, keeping in control, although Col. Wainwright's artillery was not informed of the order to retreat and found themselves alone. When Wainwright realized his situation, he ordered his gun <b>crews</b> <b>to</b> withdraw at a walk, not wishing to panic the infantry and start a rout. As pressure eventually increased, Wainwright ordered his 17 remaining guns to gallop down Chambersburg Street, three abreast. A.P. Hill failed to commit any of his reserves {{to the pursuit of}} the Seminary defenders, a great missed opportunity.|$|E
5|$|While {{on patrol}} the cutters {{operated}} under orders from an operational commander at the CSC {{and not the}} division commander {{to which they were}} assigned. The division was responsible for seeing that each cutter was ready to perform her assignments and properly supplied with trained personnel, supplies and equipment. Each division's staff performed regular readiness reviews on each assigned cutter; riding with the <b>crews</b> <b>to</b> judge their effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|A third raid, {{consisting}} of six unescorted Hudsons of No. 62 Squadron RAF, flying from Palembang, Sumatra, attacked shortly afterwards, losing {{two of their}} number, with their entire <b>crews,</b> <b>to</b> six Ki-27s. A fourth raid, made up of five Bristol Blenheims of No. 27 Squadron RAF, set off from Palembang later in the day, but had only {{got as far as}} Singapore by sunset, so aborted the mission. Despite claims to have scored multiple hits on both transports and a cruiser, neither the transports, nor any of their escorts were damaged; the former were hit by splinters that killed 8 and wounded 18, but Sendai and the smaller ships were untouched.|$|E

5|$|According to BAE Systems, the Nimrod MRA4 systems was {{to enable}} the <b>crews</b> <b>to</b> gather, process and display up to 20 times more {{technical}} and strategic data than the MR2. The Searchwater 2000 radar was stated to have been capable over land as well as water; {{with the ability to}} have swept {{an area the size of}} the UK every 10 seconds. The Aircraft Synthetic Training Aids (ASTA) provided by Thales Training & Simulation was an electronic training suite to allow the training of crew members to transfer from active MRA4 aircraft to ground-based training systems; this change was made to increase the availability of the aircraft for operational missions and allow for more intensive training exercises.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is unknown}} when it was opened, Loring was host to a Conventional Enhanced Release Training bomb range, which was located {{adjacent}} to the runway. Loring {{was one of four}} Strategic Air Command bases with a range of this type, and it was used frequently. The base was also located next to Condor 1 and Condor 2 airspace, which allowed for low-level training. The routes and training opportunities within the restricted airspace allowed training to be accomplished. One disadvantage of the location of Loring was its distance from the Strategic Training Route Complex and bombing ranges in Nevada and Utah. The ranges out west were the only location where the B-52s were allowed to drop live munitions, although SAC training only required <b>crews</b> <b>to</b> drop live munitions twice a year on these ranges.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{were now}} made {{to find a}} role for the {{remaining}} 19 locomotives. By now many had been relegated to hauling trains in what were once seen as remote outposts of the LMS. Often they were reduced to pulling stopping trains, empty stock trains, or even goods trains. Only one realistic mainline role was contemplated: to replace the Scottish Region A4 Class on the testing route between Edinburgh Waverley and Aberdeen. This idea was discarded largely {{because it would be}} excessively problematic to train the A4 <b>crews</b> <b>to</b> operate the Coronations. With no credible role, only one option remained: in July 1964 it was resolved that the remaining 19 locomotives were to be withdrawn from 12 September.|$|E
50|$|In July 2014, {{under the}} team Fast Row West, Sparks captained {{a crew of}} four on the first ever {{unsupported}} row from Exmouth, Australia to the Seychelles. The team became the fastest four-man <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> cross the Indian Ocean and the youngest four-man <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> cross any ocean. The intended destination had originally been the island of Mauritius however, massive equipment failure and extreme weather conditions led <b>to</b> the <b>crew</b> having <b>to</b> detour to the Seychelles.|$|R
50|$|Soyuz TMA-07M (Союз ТМА-07M) was a spaceflight {{launched}} to the International Space Station in 2012 which transported {{three members}} of the Expedition 34 <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> the station. The Soyuz remained docked to the space station and served as an emergency escape vehicle for the Expedition 35 increment, before returning its <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> Earth in May 2013.|$|R

5|$|Braathens Helikopter was a pure {{helicopter}} airline, with a {{main base}} at Stavanger Airport, Sola and a secondary base at Bergen Airport, Flesland. It operated seven Aérospatiale Super Puma helicopters, each with nineteen seats. They were used exclusively on long-term contracts with oil companies to ship <b>crews</b> <b>to</b> their oil platforms in the Norwegian {{sector of the}} North Sea. The company employed at the most 120 people, was owned by Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi, and was a sister company of Braathens SAFE. The airline served seven oil fields: Ekofisk, Gullfaks, Gyda, Oseberg, Ula, Valhall, Veslefrikk. These were on contract with Amoco, British Petroleum, Norsk Hydro, Phillips Petroleum and Statoil. The company had a 30% market share before it was sold.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} August, news {{had reached}} Charles Town that Bonnet's vessels were moored in the Cape Fear River. Robert Johnson, {{governor}} of South Carolina, authorised Colonel William Rhett to lead a naval expedition against the pirates, even though the Cape Fear River was in North Carolina's jurisdiction. After a false start due to the appearance of another pirate ship near Charles Town, Rhett arrived {{at the mouth of}} the Cape Fear River on 26September with two eight-gun sloops, the Henry and the Sea Nymph, and a force of 130 militia men. Bonnet initially mistook Rhett's squadron for merchantmen and sent three canoes to capture them. Unfortunately for Rhett, his flagship Henry had run aground in the river mouth, enabling Bonnet's canoe <b>crews</b> <b>to</b> approach, recognize the heavily armed and manned sloops as hostile and return uninjured to warn Bonnet. The sun had set by the time the rising tide lifted the Henry off the river bottom.|$|E
5|$|Developed {{in tandem}} with the single-player mode, the online {{multiplayer}} mode Grand Theft Auto Online was conceived as a separate experience to be played in a continually evolving world. Up to 30 players freely roam across the game world and enter lobbies to complete jobs (story-driven competitive and cooperative modes). The Content Creator toolset lets players create their own parameters for custom jobs, like racetracks and deathmatch weapon spawn points. Players may band together in organised player teams called <b>crews</b> <b>to</b> complete jobs together. Rockstar Games Social Club extends crews formed in Max Payne 3 multiplayer mode to those of Grand Theft Auto Online. Players may create their own crews and join up to five total. Crews win multiplayer matches to earn experience points and climb online leaderboards.|$|E
