He agrees to cooperate with the survivors to escape from the Auriga. When Call's identity as an Auton is revealed, DiStephano summarizes their history as second-generation synthetics created by other synthetics as sleeper agents. After DiStephano and the group board the Betty, the ship's <b>cargo</b> <b>hatch</b> is stuck open; when Call tries to fix it, she is confronted by the stowaway Newborn. DiStephano checks on her and is caught by the Newborn, which crushes his skull.|$|E
5|$|The Tupolev OKB {{began work}} in September 1946 on a {{military}} transport version of the Tupolev Tu-70 airliner and this was confirmed by the Council of Ministers on 11 March 1947 with state trials to begin in August 1948. To expedite the process, maximum use was made of components of the Tu-70. Its engines were the uprated Shvetsov ASh-73TKFN or TKNV fuel-injected version. A new, narrower fuselage was designed, which included a rear <b>cargo</b> <b>hatch,</b> a vehicle loading ramp and paratroop exit doors. Three gun turrets (dorsal, ventral and tail), were to be adapted from the Tu-4, although they were not fitted on the prototype. It had a crew of six (two pilots, three gunners, a radio operator, and a navigator).|$|E

25|$|The raider carried two Arado Ar 196 floatplanes for reconnaissance. Although Detmers {{wanted a}} catapult, such {{equipment}} would have spoiled any merchant ship disguise used by Kormoran; instead, the planes were stored inside No. 5 <b>cargo</b> <b>hatch,</b> and were launched and {{recovered from the}} water with hoists. Mechanical problems, difficulties in moving the aircraft between the hatch and the water, plus a lack of opportunities meant that only seven flights were made during the ship's operational deployment.|$|E
25|$|The Caravan {{interior}} can be {{outfitted with}} seats or as a cargo compartment. The standard high-density airline configuration has four rows of 1-2 seating behind the two {{seats in the}} cockpit. This variant is capable of holding up to thirteen passengers, although it is marketed as {{being able to make}} a profit carrying just four. The cabin can be configured in a low density passenger configuration, with 1-1 seating, as a combination of passengers and cargo, or as a strictly cargo aircraft. Many variants include an underbelly cargo pod, which can be used for additional freight capacity, or for passenger baggage. A number of Caravans are operated as skydiving aircraft with the left-side <b>cargo</b> <b>hatch</b> converted to a roll-up door.|$|E
25|$|Dronning Maud set {{off from}} Sørreisa at around 11:30 on 1 May 1940, {{arriving}} at Foldvik {{three to four}} hours later in calm seas and sunshine. As the ship was about to dock with the small wharf on her port side two or three aircraft of the German Lehrgeschwader 1 made a low-level attack with bombs and machine gun fire on the Norwegian steamer. Seven bombs were dropped from the aircraft, with two being direct hits, one between the funnel and the bridge, the other just aft of the fore <b>cargo</b> <b>hatch.</b> The first bomb entered the engine room and blew out the ship's sides and the second exploded {{in the bottom of the}} hull. The first bomb killed everyone in the refrigeration room, four men and three women. As the crew and passengers tried to abandon ship only one or two boats could be lowered into the water due to the fire that had broken out on board. The fire also threatened to destroy the wooden wharf at Foldvik, until a local fishing boat managed to pull the burning ship some distance away from shore. Dronning Maud drifted a short distance, then ran aground, burned and sank listing to port.|$|E
40|$|Five ocean vessels were {{investigated}} for the characterization and quantification of gaseous compounds emitted during ocean transportation of wood pellets in closed <b>cargo</b> <b>hatches</b> from Canada to Sweden. The study was initiated after a fatal accident with several injured during discharge in Sweden. The objective {{with the investigation}} was {{to better understand the}} off-gassing and issues related to workers' exposure. Air sampling was done during transport and immediately before discharge in the undisturbed headspace air above the wood pellets and in the staircase adjacent to each hatch. The samples were analyzed with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and direct reading instruments. The following compounds and ranges were detected in samples from the five ships: carbon monoxide (CO) 1460 - 14650 ppm, carbon dioxide (CO 2) 2960 - 21570 ppm, methane 79. 9 - 956 ppm, butane equivalents 63 - 842 ppm, ethylene 2 - 21. 2 ppm, propylene 5. 3 - 36 ppm, ethane 0 - 25 ppm and aldehydes 2. 3 - 35 ppm. The oxygen levels were between 0. 8 and 16. 9 %. The concentrations in the staircases were almost as high as in the <b>cargo</b> <b>hatches,</b> indicating a fairly free passage of air between the two spaces. A potentially dangerous atmosphere was reached within a week from loading. The conclusions are that ocean transportation of wood pellets in confined spaces may produce an oxygen deficient atmosphere and lethal levels of CO which may leak into adjacent access spaces. The dangerous combination of extremely high levels of CO and reduced oxygen produces a fast-acting toxic combination. Measurement of CO in combination with oxygen is essential prior to entry in spaces having air communication with <b>cargo</b> <b>hatches</b> of wood pellets. Forced ventilation of staircases prior to entry is necessary. Redesign, locking and labeling of access doors and the establishment of rigorous entry procedures and training of onboard crew as well as personnel boarding ocean vessels are also important...|$|R
50|$|Kayaks are long—19 ft, short—6 ft, wide—42 in, or as narrow as the paddler's hips. They may attach {{one or two}} {{stabilizing}} hulls (outriggers), have twin hulls like catamarans, inflate or fold. They move via paddles, pedals {{that turn}} propellers or underwater flippers, under sail, or motor. They're made of wood/canvas, wood, carbon fiber, fiberglass, Kevlar, polyethylene, polyester, rubberized fabric, neoprene, Nitrylon, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyurethane, and aluminum. They may sport rudders, fins, bulkheads, seats, eyelets, foot braces and <b>cargo</b> <b>hatches.</b> They accommodate 1-3 or more paddlers/riders.|$|R
50|$|The biggest glitch in {{the system}} would come about if the dockers had a strike: they would always open the hatches (breaking the {{temperature}} control seal in the <b>cargo</b> <b>hatches)</b> and put the banana elevators down the hatches so {{they could not be}} re-sealed; then go on strike. This way, if the owner did not give in {{to the demands of the}} dockers, the whole cargo would go ripe in only a very few days and would have to be dumped on the way back across the Atlantic to the West Indies.|$|R
500|$|Wittekind and sister-ship Willehad {{were both}} quickly {{found to be}} {{deficient}} in cargo space, and plans were made to lengthen both vessels (though Willehad was never lengthened). Wittekind 's bridge was moved forward and a <b>cargo</b> <b>hatch</b> was installed behind it. After this, the ship was cut into two parts forward of the bridge's new position, and a new [...] section was inserted, which greatly increased the cargo capacity. Sources disagree as to where the procedure was performed with one reporting it was performed at the Seebeck Yard in Germany, while another claims it was done by Tyne Pontoons & Drydock Co., at Newcastle. Wherever the work was performed, it was completed by March 1900.|$|E
500|$|Fighting {{their way}} forward, the M113s finally arrived by 18:15 and began loading the most badly wounded as {{darkness}} approached. The Viet Cong subsequently launched two successive counter-attacks, assaulting B Company {{from the east}} and south-east; however, both attacks were repulsed by the Australians, as they responded with small arms fire while Mackay called-in an airstrike. During the fighting one of the APCs was subsequently disabled by a recoilless rifle at close range, killing the driver and wounding the crew commander. A second round then struck the open <b>cargo</b> <b>hatch,</b> wounding several more men and re-wounding {{a number of the}} Australian casualties. A third round then landed nearby, as the M113s returned fire with their [...]30 and [...]50 calibre machine-guns. Under covering fire the Australians attempted to recover the damaged vehicle, yet it became stuck hard against a tree. With the Viet Cong threatening a further attack from the north-east, the Australian cavalry swept the area with a heavy volume of fire and were met by equally heavy return fire. By 18:50 the light was fading rapidly, while the bulk of 5 Platoon's more serious casualties had been evacuated by APC. However, with many of the Australian dead lying in close proximity to the Viet Cong positions, no attempt was made to recover them due to the likelihood of further casualties. Meanwhile, the damaged APC was subsequently destroyed with white phosphorus grenades to prevent its weapons and equipment from being captured.|$|E

5|$|A hatch or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow hatches to be opened and closed are called hatch cover. In general, hatch covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and unload <b>cargo,</b> <b>hatches</b> must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the hatches, and these areas must be reinforced. Often, hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|R
2500|$|The {{design was}} a four-engine high-wing {{monoplane}} with tricycle undercarriage, originally designed for 14 (three abreast seating with six additional seats {{mounted on the}} side) and eventually converted to take 20 passengers. The side [...] "couch seats" [...] were also able to be folded away so that cargo could be carried internally in the cabin. Individual storage space was provided for each passenger seat on the fuselage side above the seat. In order to accommodate a larger cargo load, a <b>cargo</b> <b>hatch</b> was located near the pilot's compartment.|$|E

The [...] guns were concealed behind false hull plates and <b>cargo</b> <b>hatch</b> walls, which would swing clear when the order to decamouflage was given, while the secondary weapons sat on hydraulic lifts hidden within the superstructure. The ship could be disguised as one of several Allied or neutral vessels.|$|E
50|$|In 1955 the Richard Schröder {{shipping}} company of Hamburg ordered {{construction of a}} dry cargo freighter from Norderwerft Köser & Meyer, also of Hamburg.

After sea trials that began on December 29, 1955, the ship was delivered to the owners on January 17, 1956. It was built as a triple-superstructure ship with the machine room aft and the bridge amidships. It was equipped with three <b>cargo</b> <b>hatches</b> and loading equipment consisting of one 25-metric ton derrick and ten 5-metric ton derricks.

The ship's engines were deactivated and the engine room and <b>cargo</b> <b>hatches</b> were sealed. External utility service ports were installed to permit connecting the ship's electrical, heating, water and sewage systems to land-based utility services. Deck equipment, including the many kingposts and booms used to load and unload the cargo holds, were removed, except for two masts. The hull was painted pristine white. Final preparation for students included adding rugs, mattresses and draperies. Additionally, the air-conditioning system was overhauled.|$|R

50|$|More {{recent work}} by Smith in 2007 {{confirmed}} prior forensic work by Faulkner in 1998 {{and determined that}} the MV Derbyshire was exposed to a hydrostatic pressure of a static head of water of about 20 m with a resultant static pressure of 201 kN/m2. This is in effect 20 metres of green water (possibly a super rogue wave) flowing over the vessel. The deck <b>cargo</b> <b>hatches</b> on the Derbyshire were determined {{to be the key}} point of failure when the rogue wave washed over the ship. The design of the hatches only allowed for a static pressure of less than two metres of water or 17.1 kN/m2, in other words the typhoon load on the hatches was more than ten (10) times the design load. The forensic structural analysis of the wreck of the Derbyshire is now widely regarded as irrefutable.|$|R

50|$|An outward-opening <b>cargo</b> <b>hatch</b> is {{inherently}} less resistant to blowing open than an inward-opening one, also called a plug door. In flight, the air pressure inside the aircraft {{is greater than}} that outside, and pushes outward on the hatch. In {{the case of a}} plug door, this actually seals the door more tightly. An outward-opening hatch, however, relies entirely upon its latch to prevent it from opening in flight. This makes it particularly important that the locking mechanisms be secure. Aircraft other than DC-10s have also experienced catastrophic failures of hatches. The Boeing 747 has experienced several such incidents, the most noteworthy of which occurred on United Airlines Flight 811 in February 1989. On Flight 811, the <b>cargo</b> <b>hatch</b> failed, causing a section of the fuselage to fail, resulting in the deaths of nine passengers, who were blown out of the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The Third-Class Open Space was a {{very large}} room all the way forward in the ship on D-Deck, {{directly}} underneath the Forward Well Deck above. It could be entered from outside via two wide staircases off the well deck or from below via another set of staircases from E-Deck. While it had tables and chairs installed along the Port and Starboard sides, as the title suggests the room was mostly open space ideal for dances and socializing. There was a bar and numerous drinking fountains throughout the room. In {{the middle of the}} space were the enclosed wells of the Bunker and No. 2 <b>cargo</b> <b>hatches,</b> through which <b>cargo</b> was lowered down to the Orlop Deck before departure.
