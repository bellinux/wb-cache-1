The <b>capsule</b> <b>machine</b> can currently be used with RT. Rock Hippo Productions introduced MP mode too, for the <b>capsule</b> <b>machine,</b> but they removed this feature soon after. Most likely because people exploited it with creating thousands of new accounts, and spinning the machine endless, until they hit an MP Jackpot, resulting in millions of MP points.Most capsule weapons do not require repairing, and MP weapons are less powerful than RT weapons.|$|R

50|$|The <b>capsule</b> <b>machine</b> (released November 11, 2011) {{features}} 'rares' {{that are}} unique and cannot be won anywhere else in-game (On rare occasions players {{may be given}} the opportunity to compete in tournaments to win temporary version of these items). Rares include a gold, silver, and bronze form. All 7 weapons have versions of their 'rares.' There are also rare clothes to be won for each character as well as a few sets. Some have since been retired. The <b>Capsule</b> <b>Machine</b> costs 1,000 RT (roughly $1) a spin where the user spinning is guaranteed an item. The chances of winning a rare based on an 100k RockToken / Weapon experiment are roughly expressed in a 1 : 75 ratio (or a 1 in 75 chance of winning a rare). Clothes are easier to win and have a rough 1 : 25 ratio per rare. Whether or not the clothing won is HP or Speed is completely random and determined on the spot.|$|R

40|$|During {{the spring}} {{semester}} of 2012 did Petra Hollsten independently a thesis on reducing {{the environmental impact of}} capsule for coffee, tea and chocolate. The work was performed at Karlstad University, Faculty of Technology and Science under the Bachelor of Science program in innovation, technology and design. The project's scope is at 22. 5 points. The employment for this project is the company Löfbergs Lila AB in Karlstad. Supervisor at the Principal has been Maria Herou Wallner and Sandra Lyxell, product managers. Supervisor at Karlstad University is Monica Jakobsson, lecturer and program leader for innovation and design engineering program. Examiner is Fredrik Thuvander, lecturer and professor at Karlstad University. The company Löfbergs Lila is a family business and one of the leading suppliers of coffee in Sweden that invests in quality from plantation to consumer and environmental responsibility. Sales of <b>capsules</b> and <b>capsule</b> <b>machines</b> are increasing very rapidly and have become very popular. The company's move to the bridge method with <b>capsule</b> <b>machines</b> must be good for the environment as possible. Which gave rise to this project to help reduce the environmental impact of the capsules? The largest part of the project was to conduct a thorough research to determine important characteristics about coffee, how the market looks for the capsules, how the capsule and the <b>capsule</b> <b>machine</b> works, the climate impact of packaging and coffee, how to evaluate environmental impact and a materials study. That is partly conducted through field visits, literature searches, and retrieval of information by providers. The result of the project was to reduce environmental impact by replacing the capsule existing materials to alternative renewable materials. To evaluate the alternative materials used tool ECO Audit Tool contained in material selection program CES EduPack 2011. Through the tool, you can read energy consumption and carbon emissions. It resulted in which material that had the lowest environmental impact. Along with the choice of material was sketched a proposal for a new design on the sleeve capsule which would lead to moving a function from capsule to capsule sleeve. This would reduce one part of the capsule and has less environmental impact and facilitate recycling for consumers...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the factors that influence fill weight and weight variability of capsules produced on the In-Cap and to assess any differences in terms of capsule defects between gelatin and HPMC (Quali-V) shells. The In-Cap is an automatic tamping type capsule-filling machine and the low output of ≈ 3000 capsules/hour makes it ideal for early formulation development and phase I/IIa clinical supplies manufacture. Four commonly used excipients (Avicel PH 101, Avicel PH 302, A-Tab, and Prosolv HD 90) and a poorly flowing drug blend were encapsulated at various pin settings and powder bed heights. The average fill weight and coefficient of weight variation were determined. The percentage of defective capsules formed during encapsulation was calculated. Results of the study showed that pin setting was critical for controlling the fill weight and the weight variation. The order of pin setting with pin 1 (closer to the powder chute) set to a relatively higher position and pin 4 (before ejection) set to a lower position was found to give higher fill weights with relatively lower weight variability. The powder bed height influenced the fill weight for poorly flowing powders. The <b>capsule</b> <b>machine</b> speed did not appear to significantly influence the fill weight. The fill weight and weight variation were found to depend on the flow property of the material. A large percentage of defective capsules was obtained using HPMC shell size # 00. Some of the commonly observed defects included split caps and improperly closed filled capsules. In general, appropriate selection of pin settings and bed height can reduce the weight variability seen, especially with poorly flowing high-dose formulations...|$|R

40|$|Hard gelatin {{capsules}} {{are manufactured}} from blends of limed ossein (LOG), acid ossein and acid pigskin gelatins, with LOGS usually forming the main {{portion of the}} blend. Unfortunately, {{the quality of the}} finished capsule cannot be predicted by routine quality control tests and 'poor' batches of LOG are encountered which form unsatisfactory capsules. In addition, differences between gelatin types are encountered in practice but the supporting literature is sparse and conflicting. This work examines some properties of gelatins pertinent to hard capsule manufacture in an attempt to relate these to gelatin type and known performance on <b>capsule</b> <b>machines.</b> Molecular mass distributions (MMD) were examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Each different gelatin type possessed a characteristic shape of MMD which could be related to the source tissue and the treatment undergone during gelatin manufacture. MMDs, isoionic point determinations and an assessment of the content of protein impurities by ultraviolet spectrophotometry failed to resolve differences between 'good' and 'poor' LOG batches. The drying rates of freshly-cast gelatin films were studied under conditions of controlled humidity, temperature and air velocity. No significant differences between gelatin types were observed. Small variations in equilibrium moisture content were seen and were tentatively ascribed to the generation of water binding sites (free carboxyl groups) during gelatin manufacture. The mechanical properties of dry gelatin films were examined by tensile stress-strain and stress-relaxation measurements. Viscoelastic behaviour typical of a polymer in the glass transition region was observed, and significant differences in film fracture strain were observed but these were not related to gelatin type. Optical rotation measurements indicated similar orders of film crystallinity and determinations of frictional characteristics similarly revealed no varietal differences. Overall, few differences related to gelatin type were seen within the properties examined. There was no evidence in these studies to explain the unsatisfactory behaviour of 'poor' LOG batches in capsule manufacture. NB.
