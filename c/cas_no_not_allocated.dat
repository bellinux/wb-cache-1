40|$|Abstract Background The exhaled {{nitric oxide}} (eNO) signal is {{a marker of}} inflammation, and can be {{partitioned}} into proximal [J'aw NO (nl/s), maximum airway flux] and distal contributions [CA NO (ppb), distal airway/alveolar NO concentration]. We hypothesized that J'aw <b>NO</b> and <b>CA</b> <b>NO</b> are selectively elevated in asthmatics, permitting identification of four inflammatory categories with distinct clinical features. Methods In 200 consecutive children with asthma, and 21 non-asthmatic, non-atopic controls, we measured baseline spirometry, bronchodilator response, asthma control and morbidity, atopic status, use of inhaled corticosteroids, and eNO at multiple flows (50, 100, and 200 ml/s) in a cross-sectional study design. A trumpet-shaped axial diffusion model of NO exchange was used to characterize J'aw <b>NO</b> and <b>CA</b> <b>NO.</b> Results J'aw <b>NO</b> was <b>not</b> correlated with <b>CA</b> <b>NO,</b> and thus asthmatic subjects were grouped into four eNO categories based on upper limit thresholds of non-asthmatics for J'aw NO (≥ 1. 5 nl/s) and <b>CA</b> <b>NO</b> (≥ 2. 3 ppb) : Type I (normal J'aw <b>NO</b> and <b>CA</b> <b>NO),</b> Type II (elevated J'aw <b>NO</b> and normal <b>CA</b> <b>NO),</b> Type III (elevated J'aw <b>NO</b> and <b>CA</b> <b>NO)</b> and Type IV (normal J'aw <b>NO</b> and elevated <b>CA</b> <b>NO).</b> The rate of inhaled corticosteroid use (lowest in Type III) and atopy (highest in Type II) varied significantly amongst the categories influencing J'aw <b>NO,</b> but was <b>not</b> related to <b>CA</b> <b>NO,</b> asthma control or morbidity. All categories demonstrated normal to near-normal baseline spirometry; however, only eNO categories with increased <b>CA</b> <b>NO</b> (III and IV) had significantly worse asthma control and morbidity when compared to categories I and II. Conclusions J'aw <b>NO</b> and <b>CA</b> <b>NO</b> reveal inflammatory categories in children with asthma that have distinct clinical features including sensitivity to inhaled corticosteroids and atopy. Only categories with increase <b>CA</b> <b>NO</b> were related to poor asthma control and morbidity independent of baseline spirometry, bronchodilator response, atopic status, or use of inhaled corticosteroids. </p...|$|R
