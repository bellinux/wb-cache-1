5000|$|A {{counterbore}} (symbol: ‚å¥) is a cylindrical flat-bottomed {{hole that}} enlarges another coaxial hole, or the tool {{used to create}} that feature. A <b>counterbore</b> <b>hole</b> is typically used when a fastener, such as a socket head cap screw, is required to sit flush with or {{below the level of}} a workpiece's surface.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{a method}} of CAP(Computer Aided Programming) for boring <b>counterbore</b> <b>holes</b> was presented. According to the {{engineering}} drawings and the given diameter of holes, the position of holes can be determined automatically. Based {{on the type of}} tools, the depth of <b>counterbore</b> <b>holes,</b> the depth of pre-manufactured holes and cutting parameters, the program of boring was generated automatically. Following the program, the process system can complete the rough boring, the finish boring, dwelling or without dwelling at downhole...|$|R
25|$|In solid timber work it {{is common}} to <b>counterbore</b> a <b>hole</b> in the frame or carcase member to conceal the head of the screw. This also allows more of the body of the screw to {{penetrate}} the adjacent member for greater traction. After the screw has been driven into the joint, the counterbore can be filled with an appropriately sized piece of dowel or a wooden plug cut from an offcut of the same timber using a plug cutter.|$|R
2500|$|The {{pocket holes}} require two {{drilling}} operations to be completed. The {{first is to}} <b>counterbore</b> the pocket <b>hole</b> itself, which houses the screw head within the member. This hole is stopped 1/4" [...] (5mm) or so {{from the edge of}} the frame member. The second step is to drill a pilot hole concentric with the pocket hole which extends through the edge of the member. The pilot hole allows the screw to pass through the member and into the adjoining member. This two stage drilling operation may be performed with two different sized drill bits, however there are special stepped bits available to perform the operation in a single pass. The drilling operation is often facilitated by a pocket hole jig which allows the user to drill the pocket hole at the correct angle and to the correct depth.|$|R
5000|$|Counterbores {{are made}} with {{standard}} dimensions for a certain size of screw or are produced in sizes that {{are not related to}} any particular screw size. In either case, the tip of the counterbore has a reduced diameter section referred to as the pilot, a feature essential to assuring concentricity between the <b>counterbore</b> and the <b>hole</b> being counterbored. <b>Counterbores</b> matched to specific screw sizes generally have integral pilots that fit the clearance hole diameter associated with a particular screw size (e.g., [...]191 inches for a number 10 machine screw). Counterbores that are not related to a specific screw size are designed to accept a removable pilot, allowing any given counterbore size to be adapted to a variety of hole sizes. The pilot matters little when running the cutter in a milling setup where rigidity is assured and hole center location is already achieved via X-Y positioning.|$|R
