5|$|Ever {{since its}} {{establishment}} Girdap served political interests, {{and it was}} later tied to the Popular Liberal Party of Stefan Stambolov. On the other hand, the Bulgarian <b>Commercial</b> <b>Bank</b> (Balgarska targovska banka), which was also founded in Ruse in 1885, {{was close to the}} Popular Party. The two banks competed for lending municipal loans and regularly used their political ties in their competition. These relations were often damaging to the Bulgarian treasury, as politicians who were also bank shareholders or somehow related to Girdap awarded contracts based on their personal interest rather than that of the state. As the Bulgarian economy consolidated {{in the first decade of}} the 20th century and the emerging industry required increasing funds, local banks grew in importance. In 1911 Girdap had a capital of 2 million leva and by 1912 it was the third-largest private bank in the Kingdom of Bulgaria after the Bulgarian <b>Commercial</b> <b>Bank</b> and the Deutsche Bank-related Credit Bank (Kreditna banka).

In measuring the cost efficiency of the <b>commercial</b> <b>banks</b> the study used the input-oriented BCC model. The study found that the average cost efficiency of state-owned <b>commercial</b> <b>banks</b> over the period 2000 - 2009 is 0. 69 while that of the private <b>commercial</b> <b>banks</b> is 0. 74. The aggregate cost efficiency of Ethiopian <b>commercial</b> <b>banks</b> is found to be 0. 73. The Kruskal-Wallis (K-W) non-parametric test indicates that the difference between the cost efficiency of the state-owned and private <b>commercial</b> <b>banks</b> is statistically insignificant.

5|$|One of Girdap's notable {{enterprises}} was {{the international}} transport company Transbalkania {{which had a}} capital of 100,000 leva. Of the company's 500 shares, 200 were owned by Girdap and another 170 were owned by three of the bank's managers or employees. Liquidated after World War I, Transbalkania was active as a carrier from Bulgaria to Edirne, Alexandroupoli, Thessaloniki and Niš and along the Danube. During the wars, Girdap was involved in tobacco trade and had warehouses in modern Dupnitsa, Blagoevgrad and Xanthi. This led {{to the establishment of}} another Girdap venture, the Bulgarian Macedonian Bank (Balgarska makedonska banka), on 21 May 1916. The Bulgarian Macedonian Bank was mostly active as a <b>commercial</b> <b>bank,</b> which is indicated by its capital of 46.95 million leva as opposed to only 13.31 million leva of deposits. Other banks more or less related to Girdap included the Sofia Bank (Sofiyska banka, established in 1906), the Bulgarian Forest <b>Commercial</b> <b>Bank</b> (Balgarska gorsko-targovska banka, established in 1917), and the Bulgarian Surety Bank (Balgarska garantsionna banka, established in 1912). The Pleven-based Lev cement factory was founded in 1917 with Girdap board of managers member Ivan Kovachev as chief shareholder. Ninety percent of the capital of the Kurilo mine in the Iskar Gorge was controlled by Girdap or its head figures Ivan Kovachev and Boncho Boev. Despite Girdap's active involvement in assistance to national industry, it failed to make a significant contribution and gradually minimized its participation due to insufficient profits.|$|E

This paper empirically examines one theoretical justification for these proposals, namely attention distortion under multiple tasks as in Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991). Universal banks can be viewed as combining two different tasks (investment <b>banking</b> and <b>commercial</b> <b>banking)</b> in the same organization. We estimate pay-performance sensitivities for different segments within universal banks and for pure investment and <b>commercial</b> <b>banks.</b> We show that the pay-performance sensitivity is higher in investment <b>banking</b> than in <b>commercial</b> <b>banking,</b> no matter whether it is organized as part of a universal bank or in a separate institution. Next, the paper shows that relative pay-performance sensitivities of investment and <b>commercial</b> <b>banking</b> are negatively related {{to the quality of the}} loan portfolio in universal banks. Depending on the specification, we obtain a reduction in problem loans when investment banking is removed from <b>commercial</b> <b>banks</b> of up to 12 percent. We interpret the evidence to imply that the higher pay-performance sensitivity in investment banking directs the attention of managers away from <b>commercial</b> <b>banking</b> within universal banks, consistent with Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991). Separation of investment <b>banking</b> and <b>commercial</b> <b>banking</b> may indeed be associated with a reduction in risk in <b>commercial</b> <b>banking...</b>|$|R

5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate is {{the rate at which}} a <b>commercial</b> <b>bank</b> is willing to commit to exchange one currency for another at some specified future date. The {{forward exchange}} rate is a type of forward price. It is the exchange rate negotiated today between a bank and a client upon entering into a forward contract agreeing to buy or sell some amount of foreign currency in the future. Multinational corporations and financial institutions often use the forward market to hedge future payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency against foreign exchange risk by using a forward contract to lock in a {{forward exchange rate}}. Hedging with forward contracts is typically used for larger transactions, while futures contracts are used for smaller transactions. This is due to the customization afforded to banks by forward contracts traded over-the-counter, versus the standardization of futures contracts which are traded on an exchange. Banks typically quote forward rates for major currencies in maturities of one, three, six, nine, or twelve months, however in some cases quotations for greater maturities are available up to five or ten years.|$|E
