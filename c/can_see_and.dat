25|$|The {{white wagtail}} is an insectivorous bird of open country, often near {{habitation}} and water. It prefers bare areas for feeding, where it <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> pursue its prey. In urban areas it has adapted to foraging on paved {{areas such as}} car parks. It nests in crevices in stone walls and similar natural and man-made structures.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the townspeople}} become {{frustrated}} by Ned's constant nagging. Bart discovers that the family's backyard contains a blind spot {{that none of}} the cameras <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> <b>and</b> he and Homer soon begin charging people to do whatever they want there. When Ned scolds Homer for allowing so many immoral activities to go on, Homer retorts that the situation is Ned's fault as he has abused his power and literally played God over the town. Ned apologizes to the town for his interference, and he and Homer proceed to destroy all the cameras. The final scene reveals that Bakerbutcher has been using the footage to put together a British reality television series called The American Oafs, which Queen Elizabeth II enjoys watching because Ralph Wiggum reminds her of her son, Prince Charles.|$|E

[...] The Baby Zoo is another place for children to interact with animals; visitors can feed and touch the animals, ride horses and rent the location for special events. More interaction with nature can be experienced by visiting the Morro la Guairita park in El Cafetal – {{commonly known as the}} Indian Caves (Spanish: Cuevas del Indio) – a system of 22 natural openings in the mountain, and the only place in Caracas where rock climbing is permitted. Guided tours are available, and views of El Ávila can be enjoyed while ascending the park.|$|E

500|$|After feeling ill for a day, Jack faints. [...] Juliet diagnoses {{him with}} {{appendicitis}} and deems an appendectomy necessary. [...] She sends Sun Kwon (Yunjin Kim) to get medical supplies from the Staff Dharma Initiative medical station. [...] Sun {{is accompanied by}} Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies) and Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader); the latter pair are increasingly distrusted by the survivors. [...] Jin realizes that Charlotte is fluent in Korean and confronts her after their successful trip, threatening to hurt Daniel if she continues to lie about her agenda and does not get Sun off the island. [...] Jack convinces Juliet {{to allow him to}} remain awake during the surgery, with Kate holding a mirror, so that he <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> direct the surgery. [...] As Juliet operates, Jack's consciousness proves to be a detriment and her nurse—dentist Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson)—knocks him out with chloroform. [...] The appendectomy is a success; afterwards, Juliet tells Kate that Jack really does love Kate and not Juliet.|$|E
500|$|When Link {{enters the}} Twilight Realm, the void that corrupts parts of Hyrule, he {{transforms}} into a wolf. He is eventually able to transform between his Hylian and wolf forms at will. As a wolf, Link loses {{the ability to}} use his sword, shield, or any secondary items; he instead attacks by biting and defends primarily by dodging attacks. However, [...] "Wolf Link" [...] gains several key advantages in return—he moves faster than he does as a human (though riding Epona is still faster) and digs holes to create new passages and uncover buried items, and has improved senses, including the ability to follow scent trails. He also carries Midna, a small imp-like creature who gives him hints, uses an energy field to attack enemies, helps him jump long distances, and eventually allows him to [...] "warp" [...] to any of several preset locations throughout the overworld. Using Link's wolf senses, the player <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> listen to the wandering spirits of those affected by the Twilight, as well as hunt for enemy ghosts named Poes.|$|E
500|$|The [...] is an eye genetic {{technique}} {{and one of}} the Three Great Dōjutsu that naturally occurs in members of the Ōtsutsuki clan and its descendants and the Hyuga clan. The Byakugan originated with Kaguya, with her son Hamura inheriting the dōjutsu before he and most of his clan took residence on the moon; only one branch of Hamura's clan remained behind and over many generations became the Hyuga clan. Unlike the Sharingan and Rinnegan which are gained through experience and time, the Byakugan manifest at the moment of the user's birth. While normally lavender-white, pupil-less eyes, Byakugan's activation causes the pupils to become more distinct while the veins near their temples bulge. The Byakugan gives the user a nearly 360-degree field of vision. The user can concentrate his or her chakra in the blind spot to achieve 360-degree awareness. They <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> focus on anything within a certain distance from themselves, the range of which can be extended through training. During Part I of the series, Neji Hyuga is limited to fifty meters; by Part II, he can see objects at least eight-hundred meters away.|$|E

500|$|The New York Dramatic Mirror {{review was}} {{positive}} despite the plot having been produced previously. The reviewer wrote, [...] "This film {{story has been}} done before and by an Independent producer, which prompts the wonder if the Independents would not do well to avoid borrowing - at least from each other. The Thanhouser producers have the excuse, however, {{in this particular case}} that the former telling of the story was a sad failure, while this one has pleasing qualities. Two fathers are determined that their children shall wed each other, but the young folks object to such cut and dried procedure, whereat the fathers pretend to quarrel and forbid the children to love, and the perverse youngsters at once elope, assisted secretly by the parents. The trick of having the boy join the girl in her apparent banishment by hiding in her trunk is the one discordant note in an otherwise plausible and human comedy." [...] The Moving Picture World was more brief, acknowledging the plausibility of the scenario and that the acting was convincing. The Moving Picture News review was also brief, stating, [...] "The film calls for shrieks of laughter; it deserved it, for it is built upon human nature. A story anyone <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> enjoy." [...] In 1912, the American Film Manufacturing Company released the similarly titled An Assisted Elopement and the Selig Polyscope Company released its own An Assisted Elopement.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} incident, WMATA General Manager John Catoe {{stated that the}} cause was not known but that [...] "the system is safe." [...] The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) began an investigation. WMATA and NTSB {{investigators}} considered several possible causes, which might include operator error, brake failure, fault in the computerized signal and operation system, {{or a combination of}} the three. During rush hour operation, train movement is typically controlled by a centralized computer system, and a separate decentralized system can automatically apply the brakes to prevent a collision. These systems had failed at least once in the past, and the NTSB subsequently identified incompatible specifications, from the maximum deceleration capability of the trains to the deceleration rates used in the wayside system design. [...] The train has a manual emergency brake, which can be applied by the driver {{in the event of an}} imminent collision, if the driver <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> identify the hazard with sufficient time to stop. Officials indicated that the manual brake was indeed engaged. It is possible that the brake system failed to perform as designed, or that the operator applied the brake too late. The lead car of the moving train was two months overdue for scheduled brake maintenance. In a press conference the evening of June 22, Catoe stated that the last car on the stopped train was a CAF 5000-Series car (car 5066), which entered service in 2001, and that the lead car on the moving train was a Rohr Industries 1000-Series car. WMATA later confirmed that all of the cars on the moving train were 1000-Series.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor, {{unable to}} leave the TARDIS due to the plague, gives Rory the lens, his sonic screwdriver, {{and a pair of}} glasses through which the Doctor <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> {{communicate}} with Rory. Rory explores the complex, and runs into a group of Handbots. The robots are quickly defeated by an older and bitter Amy, who is now a vigilante with the aid of Interface, but has otherwise been unable to escape. She is angry with the Doctor, telling him she has been waiting 36 years for rescue. [...] She has been alone except for a reprogrammed Handbot called [...] "Rory". The Doctor realises they have mistakenly latched onto the wrong time stream, and urges the older Amy to help find her younger self. She refuses, knowing that if the younger Amy is rescued, she will cease to exist. Though Rory considers saving the older Amy, the Doctor warns him that by taking her aboard the TARDIS, they will forgo any chance of rescuing the younger Amy. The Doctor discovers evidence of younger Amy nearby, and instructs Rory to use the lens to communicate with her, hoping that seeing the younger, crying Amy will convince the older one to help with the rescue. The older Amy remembers this discussion from when she was younger Amy and had failed to convince the older Amy to help. However, this time the younger Amy convinces the older Amy to change her mind by asking her to consider Rory. The older Amy agrees to help if the Doctor would take her too; the Doctor promises to do so despite the difficulty in completing the action since the TARDIS will be unable to handle the paradox of having two Amys from different timestreams aboard together.|$|E
