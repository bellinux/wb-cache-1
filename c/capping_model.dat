How structural proteins support cellular movement and how cytoskeletal dynamics and motor proteins are harnessed to generate order and movement are among the fundamental and not fully resolved questions in biology today. Protozoan parasites belonging to the Apicomplexa are of enormous medical and veterinary significance, being responsible {{for a wide variety}} of diseases in human and animals, including malaria, toxoplasmosis, coccidiosis and cryptosporidiosis. These obligate intracellular parasites exhibit a unique form of actin-based gliding motility, which is essential for host cell invasion and spreading of parasites throughout the infected hosts. A motor complex composed of a small myosin of class XIV associated with a myosin light chain and a plasma membrane-docking protein is present beneath the parasite's plasma membrane. According to the <b>capping</b> <b>model,</b> this complex is connected directly or indirectly to transmembrane adhesin complexes, which are delivered to the parasite surface upon microneme secretion.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} transforming growth factor-b-induced gene producth 3 (big-h 3) expression in dental pulp tissue and its effects on odontoblastic differentiation of dental pulp cells (DPCs). Design: A rat direct pulp <b>capping</b> <b>model</b> was prepared using perforated rat upper first molars capped with mineral trioxide aggregate cement. Human DPCs (HDPCs) were isolated from extracted teeth. big-h 3 expression in rat dental pulp tissue and HDPCs was assessed by immunostaining. Mineralization of HDPCs was assessed by Alizarin red-S staining. Odontoblast-related gene expression in HDPCs was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. Results: Expression of big-h 3 was detected in rat dental pulp tissue, and attenuated by direct pulp capping, while expression of interleukin- 1 b and tumor necrosis factor-a was increased in exposed pulp tissue. big-h 3 expression was also detected in HDPCs, with reduced expression during odontoblastic differentiation. The above cytokines reduced big-h 3 expression in HDPCs, and promoted their mineralization. Recombinant big-h 3 inhibited the expression of odontoblast-related genes and mineralization of HDPCs, while knockdown of big-h 3 gene expression promoted the expression of odontoblast-related genes in HDPCs. Conclusions: The present findings suggest that big-h 3 in DPCs may be involved in reparative dentin formation and that its expression is likely to negatively regulate this process...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master thesis can be {{described}} by extending the current UMTS <b>CAP</b> <b>model,</b> developed by Frank Phillipson [20], with respect to several aspects. To extend thecurrent <b>CAP</b> <b>model</b> two aspects have to be included, namely fast fading and cell breathing. The definition of the main research question of this master thesis is: “Given a particular load in the UMTS network and the corresponding pilot power in a particular pixel x, what can we say about the Cell Assignment Probability of that pixel x? ” It can be concluded that the fast fading component can be neglected as component for {{the extension of the}} <b>CAP</b> <b>model.</b> Reason for this conclusion is given {{by the fact that the}} effect of fast fading is already solved by the timers of the soft handover algorithm. To include cell breathing within the current <b>CAP</b> <b>model</b> we have to consider a loaded network, instead of a network without traffic. Therefore, the <b>CAP</b> <b>model</b> based on CPICH power will be changed into a <b>CAP</b> <b>model</b> based on CPICH quality. Consequently, the calculation of the corresponding interference becomes an important requirement. The interference calculation can be accurately done by Monte Carlo simulations.

40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{strengths}} of elasto-plastic <b>cap</b> <b>models</b> is their ability to capture the gross inelastic coupling between deviatoric and volumetric behaviors of many porous media.

40|$|Understanding the {{behavior}} of soil under blast loading {{is very important to}} engineers in mining, tunneling, and military construction. Due to the very complex structure of a soil mass {{it is very difficult to}} describe its constitutive relation, especially when it has different water contents and it is under blast loading conditions. New protective system designs subjected to blast loading need to be proved its validation prior to predict effect of explosive before implementation. Full-scale, buried explosive tests are costly. Finite element simulations play a significant role in the design of protective systems, for example a bottom platform of lightweight vehicles, against underground explosion. ^ The Perzyna viscoplastic <b>cap</b> <b>model</b> has been shown to be a valid model for use in the simulations of dry soil behavior under both static and dynamic loading. This model is a dramatic improvement over the inviscid <b>cap</b> <b>model</b> for soil behavior under high strain rate loading, such as from an explosion. However, soil should be modeled as a three-phase porous media to accommodate various degrees of water saturation. This is especially true for the soil mass surrounding the source of energy release, as each of the three phases responds differently to shock loading. To improve the model accuracy, a revised model comprising a Gruneisen equation of state (EOS) for each of the three phases has been developed. These equations of state for solid, water and air have been integrated with a viscoplastic <b>cap</b> <b>model</b> to simulate behaviors of soil with different degrees of water saturation. ^ These EOS models as well as the viscoplastic <b>cap</b> <b>model</b> are implemented into LS-DYNA as user-supplied subroutines for numerical simulation of six explosive tests in dry soil as well as in saturated soil. The shock front time of arrival, the air pressure directly above the buried explosive, and the ejecta heights predicted by the revised <b>cap</b> <b>model</b> agree fairly well with the experimental data. Four elements from finite element mash are selected to observe three phases volume fractions change. There is noticeable improvement in the prediction of saturated soil behavior than dry soil behavior under blast loading. It is concluded that the revised model is adequate for blast loading behavior simulations for soil with different degrees of water saturation. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{two most}} salient {{dichotic}} pitches, the Huggins pitch (HP) and the binaural edge pitch (BEP), {{are produced by}} applying interaural phase transitions of 360 and 180 degrees, respectively, to a broadband noise. This paper examines accounts of these pitches, concentrating on a “central activity pattern” (<b>CAP)</b> <b>model</b> and a “modified equalization-cancellation” (mE-C) <b>model.</b> The <b>CAP</b> <b>model</b> proposes that a dichotic pitch is heard at frequency f when an individual across-frequency scan in an interaural cross-correlation matrix contains a sharp peak at f. The mE-C model proposes that a dichotic pitch is heard when a plot of interaural decorrelation against frequency contains a peak at f. The predictions of the models diverge for the BEP at very narrow transition bandwidths: the mE-C model predicts that salience is sustained, while the <b>CAP</b> <b>model</b> predicts that salience declines and that the dominant percept is of the in-phase segment of the noise. Experiment 1 showed that the salience of the BEP was sustained at the narrowest bandwidths that could be generated (0. 5 % of the transition frequency). Experiment 2 confirmed that the pitch of a BEP produced by a 0. 5 % transition bandwidth {{was close to the}} frequency of the transition band. Experiment 3 showed that pairs of simultaneous narrow 180 -degree transitions, whose frequencies corresponded to vowel formants, were perceived as the intended vowels. Moreover, the same vowels were perceived whether the in-phase portion of the noise lay between the two transition frequencies or on either side of them. In contrast, different patterns of identification responses were made to diotic band-pass and band-stop noises whose cutoff frequencies corresponded to the same formants. Thus, the vowel-identification responses made to the dichotic stimuli were not based on hearing the in-phase portions of the noise as formants. These results are not predicted by the <b>CAP</b> <b>model</b> but are consistent with the mE-C model. It is argued that the mE-C model provides a more coherent and parsimonious account of many aspects of the HP and the BEP than do alternative models...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: pages 208 - 222. The major {{objective}} of the work presented in this thesis was {{the development of a}} constitutive model for hard rock at high pressure. The model should capture the important features of material behaviour and should be soundly based on mechanical principles; furthermore it should be simple enough to permit implementation and use in large general purpose finite element codes. As a preliminary exercise, a state-of-the-art plasticity <b>cap</b> <b>model</b> was developed in order to provide a basis for comparison with the new <b>model.</b> Existing <b>cap</b> <b>models</b> were shown to exhibit certain inconsistencies associated with the suppression of a regime of potentially unstable behaviour; these inconsistencies were identified and eliminated in. the formulation which is presented in this thesis. The new rock model was based on internal damage concepts. The model is isotropic, and internal damage is measured by a scalar damage parameter. The properties of the material degrade as the damag~ parameter increases, and an evolution law governs the rate at which damage occurs. The damage model was calibrated against experimental results for Bushveld Norite, which is a very hard, brittle rock. The general form of the model, however, is suitable for application to soil and concrete. Both the plasticity <b>cap</b> <b>model</b> and the damage model were implemented into the finite element code NOSTRUM (developed by the Applied Mechanics Research Unit at the University of Cape Town).

40|$|The {{predictions}} of three models are compared {{with respect to}} existing experimental data on {{the perception of the}} Fourcin pitch (FP) and the dichotic repetition pitch (DRP). Each model generates a central spectrum (CS), which is examined for peaks at frequencies consistent with the perceived pitches. A modified equalization-cancellation (mE-C) model of binaural unmasking [Culling and Summerfield, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 98, 785 – 797 (1995) ] generates a CS which reflects the degree of interaural decorrelation present in each frequency channel. This model accounts for the perceived frequencies of FPs, but produces no output for DRP stimuli. A restricted equalization-cancellation (rE-C) model [Bilsen and Goldstein, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 55, 292 – 296 (1974) ] sums the time-varying excitation in corresponding frequency channels, without equalization, to form a CS. A central activity pattern (<b>CAP)</b> <b>model</b> [Raatgever and Bilsen, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 80, 429 – 441 (1986) ] generates a CS by scanning an interaural cross-correlation matrix across frequency.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to improve}} our {{understanding}} of the fundamental processes affecting the growth of sea ice in the polar oceans in order to improve climate models. Newly formed sea ice contains a significant amount of salt as liquid brine in the interstices of an ice matrix. My focus is on one of the processes by which the salt content of sea ice decreases, namely convective desalination, which is also often called gravity drainage by geophysicists. Modelling convective desalination requires an understanding not only of the thermo-dynamics of sea-ice growth but also of its internal fluid dynamics. This thesis considers a class of physical systems called mushy layers, of which sea ice is an example. Mushy layers are multi-component systems consisting of a porous matrix of solid phase whose interstices contain the same substance in the liquid phase. I develop a mathematical description of these systems in terms the of mushy-layer equations and explore the appropriate boundary conditions at a mush-liquid interface. I develop a simple Chimney-Active-Passive (<b>CAP)</b> <b>model</b> of convection in mushy layers for arrays of liquid chimneys in two and three dimensions. This allows the interstitial fluid flow and salt flux from the mushy layer to be determined in terms of the dimensionless parameters of the system. I discuss important mathematical and physical aspects of the <b>CAP</b> <b>model.</b> I then explain the physics of gravity drainage from sea ice, elucidating the connection between downward flow through liquid brine channels (chimneys) and a convective upwelling {{in the rest of the}} ice that is sustained by horizontal density differences and provides the fluid to replace that which drains from the ice. I use the <b>CAP</b> <b>model</b> to determine the convective upwelling velocity mathematically, deriving a new, physical parameterization of gravity drainage. I test my predictions by investigating previous laboratory observations of the propagation of dye fronts. Finally, I take a one-dimensional, thermodynamic sea-ice model of the kind currently used in coupled climate models and parameterize convective desalination using the <b>CAP</b> <b>model.</b> The parameterization allows determination of physical properties and salt fluxes from sea ice dynamically, corresponding to the calculated, evolving salinity of the sea ice, in contrast to older, established models that prescribe a fixed salinity. I find substantial differences compared to previous models, particularly in terms of predicted salt fluxes from sea ice. I explain the likely implications and potential advantages of my parameterization for climate models...|$|R

If the geometrical screening is not possible, for instance, on field lines with a super-Goldreich-Julian current, then the electric field at the pair production front is constrained to be fairly small in comparison with values expected typically by the conventional polar <b>cap</b> <b>models.</b> This is because (1) positive space charge by pair polarization {{is limited to a}} small value, and (2) returning of positrons leave pair electrons behind. A previous belief that pair creation with a pair density higher than the Goldreich-Julian density immediately screens out the electric field is unjustified at least for for a super Goldreich-Julian current density. We suggest some possibilities to resolve this difficulty. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
40|$|A finite-element {{model of}} the cold {{compaction}} of ceramic powders by uniaxial pressing is developed and validated by comparison with experimental data. The mechanical behavior of processing powders is assumed according to the modified Drucker–Prager <b>cap</b> <b>model.</b> The frictional effects and the mechanical behavior of tools {{involved in the process}} are taken into account. The proposed model allows evaluation of the density distribution into the processed part, as well as stress and strain fields.

40|$|Abstract. We study self-consistency for {{the pulsar}} polar <b>cap</b> <b>model.</b> In general, there will remain an {{unscreened}} electric {{field at the}} pair production front (PPF). We have derived the condition of electric field screening by pairs {{in the presence of}} returning particles. A previous belief that pairs with a density higher than the Goldreich-Julian density immediately screen out the electric field beyond PPF is unjustified. Pairs have little contribution on screening the electric field, and the geometrical screening is the only known way of getting a finite potential drop. 1...|$|R
40|$|The two known {{gamma ray}} pulsars, the Crab and Vela, {{were used as}} guides for the {{development}} of models of high-energy radiation from spinning neutron stars. Two general classes of models were developed: those with the gamma radiation originating in the pulsar magnetosphere far from the neutron star surface (outer gap models) and those with the gamma radiation coming from above the polar <b>cap</b> (polar <b>cap</b> <b>models).</b> The goal is to indicate how EGRET can contribute to understanding gamma-ray pulsars, and especially how it can help distinguish between models for emission...|$|R
