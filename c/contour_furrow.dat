40|$|A {{rainwater}} {{harvesting system}} on slopes using contour furrows with plastic-covered transverse ridges designed {{to be used in}} small rainfall dominated areas of the semiarid loess region of China has been tested from 2001 to 2004. The system consisted of constructing contour furrows on the loess slope at a distance of 5 m with plastic-covered transverse ridges built in the furrows between shrubs of Caragana korshinskii. There were three treatments in the study: (1) plastic-covered ridge with gravel-mulched furrows (T 1), (2) plastic-covered ridge with bare furrows (T 2), and (3) control (no ridge and no <b>contour</b> <b>furrow)</b> (T 3). The experimental results indicated that runoff from the natural loess slope was small and variable, and only produced from a few rainfall events with high intensity. Runoff efficiency averaged 13. 8, 4. 5, 1. 4, and 0. 4 % in 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. However, the plastic-covered ridges accumulated runoff from most rainfall events, particularly from the light rains less than 5 mm. So the natural loess slope between the furrows and the plastic-covered ridges in the furrows can complement each other, i. e., the plastic-covered ridges induce runoff from small rainfall to the planted area, and the natural loess slope between the furrows concentrate runoff from heavy rainfall, thus improving rain use efficiency. The total runoff collected from both the natural loess slope and the plastic-covered ridges to the planted area in the furrows was 231, 143, 88, and 59 mm in 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. Soil moisture storage in the 200 -cm deep soil layer was obviously higher for T 1 and T 2 than for T 3, and C. korshinskii showed a significant improvement in growth for the T 1 and T 2 treatments. Therefore the combination of contour furrows and plastic-covered ridges as {{rainwater harvesting system}} may have a great potential development in the small rainfall dominated arid regions of China. ...|$|E
3000|$|The largest {{environmental}} {{challenge that}} Iran and humankind {{in the world}} face today is the scarcity of water (Vialle et al. 2011, 2012; Zhang et al. 2014). This phenomenon, especially in Iran, seems {{to be due to}} climatic conditions, such as aridity and abundance of high solar radiation and by population pressure. Iran is one of the ten most water-deprived countries in the world, and also is the second largest country in the Middle East, and its average annual rainfall is 240  mm, which is less than one-third of the global average value, making the region among the world’s driest regions. Recent studies in Iran have shown that the total volume of annual precipitation is almost 430 billion m 3, but that more than 20 % is lost in the form of flash floods (Foltz 2002; Khaleghi et al. 2011). Unfortunately, current water use already in Iran exceeds renewable supply remarkably, and thus, it is necessary to find various and alternative sources of water to increase the sources of water supply, such as RWHSs (rainwater that falls onto rooftop of buildings and is collected directly into a rain storage tank) that is the most directly accessible water resources (Jones and Hunt 2010; Khaleghi and Varvani 2018 a, b). Thus, scientific planning and management are needed to use rainwater efficiently (Khaleghi et al. 2011; Youn et al. 2012; Khaleghi et al. 2014). The watershed management approach is as a fundamental principle in the ecology of the ecosystem which takes into account to make a relationship between basic and applied sciences. Achieving this approach involves an integrative management combined with the holistic, accurate and fair approach in relation to internal and external processes of watershed which eventually lead to a sustainable ecosystem. In a comprehensive approach to the watershed, the base of management is guiding to the hydrology. Because of increased runoff, in addition to causing flooding damage, types of pointers (specific) and nonpoint source (NPS) pollution, such as depositions, pesticides, heavy metals, salts and chemical materials, increase and seriously endanger the health of the accumulation environment. NPS pollution refers to both water and air pollution from diffuse sources. According to Vijayaraghavan et al. (2012) and other limited literature on runoff quality assessment, urban runoffs are often regarded as a source of contaminants (Moran et al. 2003; Berndtsson et al. 2006; Teemusk and Mander 2007; Berndtsson 2010). In recent decades, in the framework of a comprehensive management, the urban watersheds have been considered from the standpoint of good urban governance and interactions with environmental conditions (Groffman et al. 2004). Thus, the correct approach in the management of urban runoff is necessarily based on a combination of purposes and strategies. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in the assessment of urban runoff and to describe of sustainable water resource management, uses the concepts of “Low Impact Development” (LID) and green infrastructures that emphasis on importance of using Best Management Practice (BMP) that from point of concept encompasses a wide variety of appropriate technologies and activities intended to minimize the effect of watershed development on flow regimes without altering riparian morphology (Perez-Pedini et al. 2005); Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) and of Storm-water Source Controls (SSCs), that these RWHSs effectively take “offline” individual micro-catchments within urban service areas could be the key solutions to alleviate these heavy burdens (Roy et al. 2008). The benefits of RWHSs as a multi-beneficial strategy are reduced and delay of runoff volume and flow peak discharge, increased groundwater recharge, reduced runoff pollution, increased decomposition of carbon, reduction in heating energy, improve air quality, aquatic habitat, wildlife and recreation, improving human health and adding value lands (Morton 2002; Muthukrishnan et al. 2004; Platt 2006; Foundation 2008). BMPs in relation to LID include structural controls such as infiltration devices, ponds, filters and constructed wetlands, and non-structural controls such as maintenance practices, street sweeping, public education and outreach programs (Muthukrishnan et al. 2004). RWHS as a viable means of closing and more sustainably managing urban water resource cycles (Daigger 2009) and as one of the tools of SUDS which aim at restoring the natural hydrologic cycle in the urban environment (Palla et al. 2011) and as a strategy that brings many benefits and may serve to cope with current water shortages, urban stream degradation and flooding (Fletcher et al. 2008; Van Roon 2007; Zhu et al. 2004; Farreny et al. 2011) which belongs to building the controls that have been used extensively according to water resources management and environmental monitoring programs. These systems are increasingly becoming {{an integral part of the}} sustainable storm-water (rainwater that falls onto catchment areas) management toolkit (Butler et al. 2010; Ward et al. 2012). Also, as an ancient technique (Boers and Asher 1982) consists of a set of measures that form of collection and use of rainwater from impervious surfaces such as roofs, earth’s surface, road surface or watersheds with low permeability (rock) (Obeidat and Awawdeh 2002). To select an RWHS system according to LID and supervising on executions, it is necessary to do various researches in the context of integrated watershed management. However, increasing the implementation of runoff harvesting, without encountering unintended impacts on downstream hydrological and ecological systems, requires a better understanding of the hydrology and environmental impacts at catchment scale (De Winnaar et al. 2007). Much research has been conducted by various researchers in the field by selecting the type of RWHS, performance, socioeconomic issues and the effects of these systems. Designing an RWHS often balances conflicting goals, such as reducing runoff volume, providing a reliable water supply and minimizing system costs (Jones and Hunt 2010). Abdulla and Al-Shareef (2009) believe that RWHSs can promote significant water saving in residences in different countries. Also, the most attractions of these systems are the low cost, accessibility and easy maintenance at the household level. <b>Contour</b> <b>furrow</b> and protective terraces, mulches, water tanks, gabion and dry-stone drainages, permeable basins and band filters are considered among these systems that have a large contribution to the collection and convey runoff from storm events, especially in urban areas. Also in agriculture, RWHSs systems have an important role in supplemental irrigation in order to increase agricultural productions and improve livelihoods in dry areas (Oweis and Hachum 2006). Runoff behavior is very important for the successful design of the RWHSs that is one of the water recovery alternatives (Li et al. 2004). In other words, the most common methodology for the design of RWHSs is the behavioral analysis that uses continuous simulation to assess the inflow, outflow and change in the storage volume of the RWHSs according to a mass balance equation (Mitchell 2007; Liaw and Tsai 2004; Palla et al. 2011). The temporal storage of water in the soil and vegetation reduces peak flow, which prolongs the time of concentration. Also, any reduction in the peak flow of local runoff results in considerable reduction in local urban flooding and combined sewer overflows (Vijayaraghavan et al. 2012). Mwenge Kahinda et al. (2008) indicated that recently, the potential of RWHSs to mitigate the variability of rainfall (spatially and temporally) becomes very obvious. Ahmed et al. (2007) proved the effectiveness of AHP in combination with GIS for analyzing the site suitability for RWHSs in the arid zone of Northern Mauritania (Oasis area).

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effectiveness of <b>contour</b> <b>furrows,</b> drill seeding, and aeration treatments in capturing overland flow, concentrating resources, and establishing perennial bunch grasses to convert dysfunctional semiarid rangeland to a functional rangeland. The site, located on the Edwards Plateau in west Texas, USA, had bare, structurally crusted soils with sparse short-grasses (Scleropogon brevifolius). The site had a low infiltration rate contributing to excess overland flow and loss of nutrients, organic matter, and soil. <b>Contour</b> <b>furrows</b> were installed with varying intra-furrow distances (0. 6 to 61 m) and then broadcast seeded to determine if furrow spacing would produce a vegetative response. Portions of the intra-furrow areas were aerated and drill seeded. All seed mixes contained warm season, perennial bunch grasses (Bouteloua curtipendula, Leptochloa dubia, and Setaria leucopila). Soil beneath furrows had greater soil water content (p-value < 0. 05) than intra-furrow areas. Furrow plots had greater density of seeded grasses and total vegetation (19 individuals m- 2 and 191 individuals m- 2, respectively) than intra-furrow plots (0 individuals m- 2 and 89 individuals m- 2, respectively). This study supports other findings that suggest 1. 5 m to 1. 8 m is optimum intra-furrow spacing. Vegetative responses to drill seeding and aeration treatments were insignificant.

40|$|In Tigray (Northern Ethiopia), soil {{moisture}} {{has been identified}} as the most limiting factor in agricultural production; on the other hand, loss of rain water through runoff as well as the induced soil loss has been determined as a critical problem in the region in the last two to three decades. To alleviate the above paradox, the government has mobilized communities and resources for the construction of physical soil and water conservation structures (stone bunds, terraces) in almost all land uses. However, yield improvement was mainly concentrated within the vicinity of the structures and runoff continued to overtop the structures, as no measures for in situ soil conservation were taken. The terwah system, consisting of traditional ploughing followed by making every 1. 5 - 2 m <b>contour</b> <b>furrows,</b> and permanent raised beds with <b>contour</b> <b>furrows</b> at 60 - 70 cm interval treatments, were considered and evaluated as practices that could increase the efficiency of in situ water utilization and soil conservation. An experiment was started in Gum Selasa, {{which is one of the}} drought prone areas in Tigray, whereby runoff volume and sediment load were measured after every rain event. Permanent raised beds with <b>contour</b> <b>furrows</b> at 60 - 70 cm interval significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced runoff volume, runoff coefficient and soil loss as compared to traditional ploughing: 255, 381 and 653 m(3) ha(- 1) runoff was recorded from permanent bed, terwah and traditional ploughing, respectively during the whole cropping season. The above runoff induced 4. 7 t ha(- 1) soil loss from permanent bed, 7. 6 t ha(- 1) from terwah and 19. 5 t ha(- 1) from traditional ploughing. Overall, <b>contour</b> <b>furrows</b> and permanent raised beds can be part of the ongoing intensification process which includes physical soil and water conservation, slope reforestation, irrigation development and agro forestry in crop lands. Moreover, the use of permanent raised beds if combined with crop mulching and crop diversification is an important component for the development of sustainable conservation agriculture practices in the region.

40|$|Water {{scarcity}} is {{a serious}} problem in many rainfed agricultural systems, particularly in the semi-arid to dry subhumid tropics. In situ water and soil conservation (WSC) practices are known to improve rainwater partitioning, especially if developed to suit a given climate, soil type as well as crops. This study evaluates the potential of using a fully coupled surface-subsurface process based model (HydroGeoSphere) to simulate in detail rainwater partitioning as affected by in situ WSC practices currently under study on Vertisols in Tigray, Ethiopia and to evaluate the treatments in terms of rainwater partitioning. In the terwah+ (TER+) practice, <b>contour</b> <b>furrows</b> of about 0. 2 m wide and 0. 1 m deep are created at 1. 5 m intervals between permanent broad beds to collect excess water while in derdero+ (DER+), permanent raised beds of 0. 6 m width with furrows of about 0. 2 m wide and 0. 1 m deep are created to prevent water logging and collect excess water that would otherwise runoff. The plus sign (+) in both practices represents retaining at least 30 % of crop residue after a cropping season, minimum tillage of the beds and crop rotations to comply with the principles of conservation agriculture. Comparison was done with the conventional tillage practice (CT) in which no <b>contour</b> <b>furrows</b> are made and at least three tillage practices are carried out with complete removal of crop residue. Field plots were permanently kept since 2005 although this study utilized measured surface runoff and moisture content for 2010 for model parameterization, and 2011 data for model verification. The model accurately reproduced measured surface runoff (e. g. in DER+: Nash-Sutcliff model efficiency E = 0. 79) and soil moisture content (DER+: E = 0. 83). Runoff depth was always lowest under DER+ followed by TER+ and significantly higher in CT. Simulated rootzone water storage was highest under DER+ practice, followed by TER+ and least under CT. Simulated transpiration, evaporation and drainage out of the rootzone were all higher under DER+ and TER+ compared to CT. The study concludes that DER+ and TER+ have positive effects on runoff reduction but recommends improvement of these practices, as was demonstrated with the calibrated model.

40|$|Past repairs {{of field}} tunnel erosion using {{mechanical}} treatments (deep ripping, <b>contour</b> <b>furrowing,</b> <b>contour</b> ripping, etc.) and reestablishment of perennial vegetation have often failed, resulting in further tunnelling. Techniques to prevent ‘piping’ (tunnel erosion) in earth dams constructed using sodic clays {{have not been}} used in the repair of field tunnel erosion; however, these techniques have the potential to reduce recurrent failure. Installation of an optical fibre cable in a Grey Sodosol and Grey Dermosol at a site near Dunalley, Tasmania, in November 2001, resulted in the formation of a 380 -m-long tunnel erosion system. Detailed site investigations and soil analysis in 2004 indicated that the tunnel erosion resulted from the consequences of inadequate compaction during the installation of the optical fibre cable, and secondary processes such as capture of surface and subsurface flow, dispersion of sodic clays, and translocation of dispersed clay platelets through the poorly compacted fill. Repair works consisted of excavating {{the entire length of the}} tunnel system, chemical amelioration with gypsum, compaction of repacked fill to reduce internal porosity, and installation of sand blocks to capture and remove water moving along the reinstalled cable. Inspections conducted 2 years after completion of the repair works indicated the site to be stable; however, it is acknowledged that this is too short an interval to adequately assess the long-term stability of repair works and techniques employed at the site.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{microclimate}} of erosion control treatments {{was carried out in}} two habitat types in a semiarid southeastern Utah, salt desert shrub area. The soils are highly eroded Mancos shale and support a low density of salt desert shrub species which offers little protection against high intensity summer convectional rainstorms. Gully plugs and <b>contour</b> <b>furrows</b> had been installed by the Bureaus of Reclamation and Land Management to prevent runoff of soil laden water which results from these summer rainfalls. Formerly this sediment was carried to the Colorado River and deposited in Lake Powell. The purpose to t he study was to measure some parameters that influenced establishment and survival of seedlings which would stabilize the structures and increase the productivity of the area. Mature, indigenous species close to the structures had greater vigor and provided a larger, more constant seed source. This seed source was important since original seedlings of introduced grasses have failed to establish and stabilize the structures. Following favorable late winter and early spring precipitation, high numbers of seedlings emerged, but few survived into mid-summer. Those that did survive were found only at or near the high water line of the gully plugs and in the bottom of <b>contour</b> <b>furrows.</b> To aid in the explanation of the differential seedling survival, soil surface moisture following rainstorms, physical and chemical soil characteristics, net radiation, soil surface temperature, and evaporation were investigated. Sampling of the 15 centimeter soil surface in the environs of the structures showed that two days after either heavy or light rainfalls, essentially no available water remained on the sloping throw positions of the structures. The bottom of the gully plugs remained flooded for several days. As a result, the seedlings were drowned. Only at the high water line of the gully plugs and in the bottom of furrows was there enough water to support seedling growth in summer. Runoff water from summer storms carried fine material into the structures, which covered and destroyed seedlings, plus lowered infiltration and permitted much of the water to be lost through evaporation. The runoff water also carried salts brought to the surface by the desert shrubs or by the upward movement of water during evaporation from the soil surface. Sampling of soil in the environs of the structures showed no substantial build up of salt, indicating that leaching had occurred, or still was occurring. This does not mean that a build up will not result in the future. Seasonal salt distribution showed that lowest salinity levels did not always coincide with springtime when seedlings generally emerged. Established seedlings were also exposed to a harsh environment of high soil surface temperatures (over 60 C) and high soil water evaporation rates that were detrimental to their survival. In summary, the study showed that the erosion control structures have created a microenvironment much different from the undisturbed soil, which only permits the establishment of species with much different tolerances from the indigenous species...|$|R

Three separate methods, erosion-pin meansurement, splash-trap (near-ground) collection to measure sediment mobilization, sediment-trap (ground-level) collection were employed to compare estimated levels of erosion, on four 6 x 20 m paired plots.

Like other Sahelian countries, Cape Verde has suffered the effects of desertification through the years, threatening the livelihood of the islands population and its fragile environment. In fact, the steep slopes in the ore agricultural islands, together with semi-arid and arid environments, characterized by an irregular and poorly distributed rainy season, with high intensity rainfall events, make dryland production a challenge. To survive in these fragile conditions, the stabilization of the farming systems and the maintenance of sustainable yields have become absolute priorities, making the islands an erosion control laboratory. Soil and water conservation strategies have been a centerpiece of the government 0 s agricultural policies for the last half century. Aiming to maintain the soil in place and the water inside the soil, the successive governments of Cape Verde have implemented a number of soil and water conservation techniques, the most common ones being terraces, half moons, live barriers, contour rock walls, <b>contour</b> <b>furrows</b> and microcatchments, check dams and reforestation with drought resistant species.

Mechanical devices, as <b>contour</b> <b>furrows,</b> structures for water spreading, etc., are means of fostering recovery and improvement of the plant cover. Permanent protection of the soil can be had only by recovery and stabilization of the vegetation.

Results from monitoring over 3 yr showed that soil loss and runoff were significantly higher (P < 0. 05) in CT followed by TER and DER+. Average soil losses of 5. 2, 20. 1 and 24. 2 t ⁄ ha were recorded from DER+, TER and CT, respectively. Runoff was 46. 3, 76. 3 and 98. 1 mm from DER+, TER and CT, respectively.

The tillage treatments were (i) permanent raised bed (PB) in a furrow and bed system with 30 % standing crop residue retention and no-tillage on top of the bed, (ii) reduced tillage (RT), with ploughing once at sowing with 30 % standing crop residue retention and <b>contour</b> <b>furrows</b> made at 1. 5 m distance interval, and (iii) conventional tillage (CT) with a minimum of 3 tillage operations and removal of crop residues. All ploughing, as well as refreshing of the furrows of the permanent raised beds when sowing, was done using the local ard plough mahresha. Crops planted during the five years were wheat, grass pea, wheat, hanfets (wheat and barley sown together) and grass pea. Glyphosate was sprayed starting from the third year (2007) at 2 L/ha before planting to control pre-emergent weed in PB and TER. Runoff and soil loss were measured in plastic sheet lined collector trenches, which were located {{at the lower end of}} each plot. Crop stands were evaluated with local farmers and NDVI was measured on the spot at several phenological stages, using green seeker. Result and Discussion: Significantly different (p< 0. 05) mean soil losses of 14, 17 and 24 t ha- 1 y- 1 were recorded for PB, RT and CT, respectively. Similarly, the mean runoff during the rainy seasons (three months) of five study periods was 900, 1011 and 1091 m 3 ha- 1 y- 1 from plots with PB, RT and CT, respectively. Five years mean runoff coefficients were 23, 26 and 28 % in PB, RT and CT, respectively. The farmers‘ evaluation of crop performance in three years (2008 - 2010) showed a significantly higher score for PB (6 / 10) and least for CT (4. 8 / 10). The NDVI of wheat (2008) was significantly higher in PB followed by RT up to 85 days after planting as compare to CT. However, after 85 days from planting CT was higher than the others due to wheat on PB was matured and dried earlier than CT. The growth of wheat in CT was slower. Plant height of wheat (2010) was significantly higher in PB throughout the growing season. Although improvements in crop yield were observed, a period of at least four years of cropping was required before they became significant. Conclusion: Overall, the permanent raised bed and reduced tillage systems significantly reduced sediment loss and runoff, and increased crop yield. It is suggested that these tillage techniques, using the local plough without modifications, be implemented widely...|$|R
40|$|Cablegation is {{a simple}} system for {{automating}} surface irrigation in small and medium-sized fields using a gated pipe. In this work, a Programmable Logic Control, PLC, was used to develop an adaptive cablegation system capable of establishing the infiltration equation in real time and then adjusting the irrigation times to the infiltration rate and field geometry. A controlling program was developed for the on-field determination of the infiltration equation, simulation of advance in each furrow, and the optimization {{and management of the}} irrigation event. The equipment was tested in three experimental stations, including a Luvissol field organized in <b>contour</b> terraces with <b>furrows</b> of various lengths The results demonstrate the capability of the system to adapt the application times to the different furrow lengths and the gradual decrease in the soil infiltration, and to recommend an application depth that optimizes the Application Efficiency. Various improvements were made to this solar-powered cablegation, resulting in a reliable surface irrigation system capable of unsupervised operation...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} and function of intercellular tight (occluding) junctions, which constitute the anatomical basis for highly regulated interfaces between tissue compartments such as the blood-testis and blood-brain barriers, are well known. Details of the synthesis and assembly of tight junctions, however, {{have been difficult to}} determine primarily because no model for study of these processes has been recognized. Primary cultures of brain capillary endothelial cells are proposed as a model in which events of the synthesis and assembly of tight junctions can be examined by monitoring morphological features of each step in freeze-fracture replicas of the endothelial cell plasma membrane. Examination of replicas of non-confluent monolayers of endothelial cells reveals the following intramembrane structures proposed as `markers' for the sequential events of synthesis and assembly of zonulae occludentes: (1) development of surface contours consisting of elongate terraces and furrows (valleys) orientated parallel to the axis of cytoplasmic extensions of spreading endothelial cells, (2) appearance of small circular PF face depressions (or volcano-like protrusions on the EF face) that represent cytoplasmic vesicle-plasma membrane fusion sites, which are positioned in linear arrays along the <b>contour</b> <b>furrows,</b> (3) appearance of 13 - 15 nm intramembrane particles at the perimeter of the vesicle fusion sites, and (4) alignment of these intramembrane particles into the long, parallel, anastomosed strands characteristic of mature tight junctions. These structural features of brain endothelial cells in monolayer culture constitute the morphological expression of: (1) reshaping the cell surface to align future junction-containing regions with those of adjacent cells, (2) delivery and insertion of newly synthesized junctional intramembrane particles into regions of the plasma membrane where tight junctions will form, and (3) aggregation and alignment of tight junction intramembrane particles into the complex interconnected strands of mature zonulae occludentes. The distribution of filipin-sterol complex-free regions on the PF intramembrane fracture face of junction-forming endothelial plasmalemmae corresponds precisely to the furrows, aligned vesicle fusion sites and anastomosed strands of tight junctional elements. To test the functional significance of these morphological features of junction-forming cells and to validate the interpretation that they are reliable indicators of the stages of tight junction genesis, primary cultures of bovine brain capillary endothelium were treated with 25 [mu]g/ml of Cytochalasin-D or 0. 25 mg/ml of n-ethylmaleimide (Sigma Chemical Co.) in order to prevent cytoskeletal mediation of surface contouring (step 1) or to inhibit vesicle fusion with the plasmalemma (step 2) and thereby prevent junction formation as a consequence of failure of the vesicle fusions to insert tight junctional intramembrane particles into the plasma membrane. Examination of platinum replicas of freeze-fractured control and treated endothelial monolayer cultures confirmed the absence of surface contours in Cytochalasin-D-treated cells, which exhibited no zonulae occludentes, and also clearly showed that n-ethylmaleimide-treated cells, which lacked tight junctions, did not have the rich endowment of vesicle fusion sites (and IMPs) which were conspicuous in control cells. Demonstration of the failure of MDCK cells to form tight junctions when cultured in the presence of 5 - 10 [mu]g/ml of cycloheximide (Griepp et al., 1983) lends further support for the schemata proposed above. Advantages of this model include: (1) all stages of de novo tight junction formation are present in each monolayer culture, and (2) cultures possess vast areas of tight junction-containing membrane which are easily sampled by freeze-fracture. This model will provide the basis for future attempts to identify the signals that regulate tight junction formation, and will facilitate studies to characterize the protein(s) of the endothelial tight junctions, the messages (m-RNA) that code for them, and ultimately, the genes bearing their blueprint...|$|R
40|$|Automation {{of surface}} {{irrigation}} {{can be an}} economic and ecological way of increasing global food production. In this work a fully automated cablegation system is evaluated that adapts the application time and depth to the actual infiltration rate of the soil in real-time. The system calculates the infiltration equation from advance times in a control furrow and then simulates irrigation in every furrow of the field, establishing the optimum application time for each furrow. The methodology was evaluated in a field organized in <b>contour</b> terraces with <b>furrows</b> of various lengths in order to evaluate practical issues affecting {{the performance of the}} system. The results confirm the temporal variability in soil infiltration, and the need for real-time determination of the infiltration equation. The evolution of furrow geometry through the season did not have an important impact on the results of the simulations. The length of the furrow considered for calculating the Kostiakov equation influences the parameters of the equation. Automation with real-time feedback can result in important savings in water and labour and can produce irrigation events with more than 90 % application efficiency. Nevertheless, the results also indicate that there are practical limits to what can possibly be achieved with automation and real-time feedback from the fiel...|$|R
40|$|Field rain {{harvest is}} the {{effective}} way anti-drought sowing {{in the northern}} dryland farming area, particularly in the hilly area of the Loess Plateau. Experiments include contour, intercropping of ridge and <b>furrow,</b> <b>contour</b> with interval of rain harvest slopes. Contour is built by making a ridge {{in the first year}} and level plowing it in several years. The size of ridge is with the height of 20 cm and the width of 35 ? 40 cm, and the furrow width is 40 ? 45 cm. There are four treatments of different ratios between the rain harvest interval and that of cropping: 1 : 1, 2 : 1, 3 : 1 and 4 : 1. Besides, different plastic covering treatments in millet field with: the normal film, filterable film and liquid film were designed. The latter could melt for filtering water when it rains and recover to avoid evaporation when it becomes dry. Comparing the effects of different field rain collecting measures, water content of the top soil in intercropping plot increases 1. 5 to 3. 1 percentage points than that of CK after a 12 mm rain, and also increases 2. 1 to 3. 9 points after 10 clear days without any rain. It increases 1. 5 to 2. 9 points and 2. 1 to 3. 9 points respectively in the contour plot. The effects are stronger after middle and heavy rains, e. g. after a 32. 3 mm heavy rain, the water content increases...|$|R
