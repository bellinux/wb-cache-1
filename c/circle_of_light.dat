25|$|In 2011, {{the band}} enlisted second guitar player Brad Cook, {{a long time}} fixture in the Melbourne scene. The {{addition}} of Brad to the line-up helped to refocus the band {{and encourage them to}} commence work on the band's fifth studio album, When The <b>Circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>Light</b> Begins to Fade (October 2013). Martin Curtis-Powell (Cradle of Filth / My Dying Bride / Anathema) also stepped in to contribute a fresh and exciting approach to the Keyboards on the album.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} depicting The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist (1608) by Caravaggio (1571–1610) is {{the most}} famous work in the church. Considered one of Caravaggio's masterpieces, the largest canvas he painted and the only painting signed by the painter, the canvas is displayed in the Oratory {{for which it was}} painted. Restored in the late 1990s in Florence, this painting is one of Caravaggio's most impressive uses of the chiaroscuro style for which he is most famous with a <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> illuminating the scene of St John's beheading at the request of Salome. The oratory also houses Caravaggio's Saint Jerome Writing (1607–1608).|$|E

5000|$|Pica's {{interest}} {{in the relationship between}} text and image is evident in Venn Diagrams (under the Spotlight), which consists <b>of</b> two colored <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> cast from theater spotlights to form a Venn diagram. The Argentinian government banned this diagram from being taught in classrooms in the 1970s, as it was thought to be an incendiary model of social collaboration. [...] "The two <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> are nothing but forms until the caption situates them historically, cluing you to their perception as subversive in the context of Argentinian dictatorship in the 1970s. I’m interested in the ideas that we project onto images and objects: how they resist as much as accommodate them." ...|$|R

In the story [...] "Derelicts", Bulkhead {{attended}} the inaugural {{meeting of the}} Grand Convocation.

500|$|The dove of the Holy Spirit hovers {{inside a}} rainbow-hued <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> {{directly}} above the Virgin's head. Its placement and size is unusual for {{art of the}} period. It is unlike anything found in van der Weyden, and never repeated in Memling's work, but reminiscent of van Eyck's dove in the Ghent Altarpiece's [...] Annunciation panel. Its shape is found in medallions hung above beds at that time, and thus seems {{in keeping with the}} domestic interior.|$|E
500|$|Berger became {{interested}} in studying the Wiccan and Pagan movement in 1986, when she presented a lecture on the subject at the Boston Public Library. Subsequently becoming acquainted {{with members of the}} New England Pagan community, she undertook fieldwork in both a local Wiccan coven, the <b>Circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>Light,</b> and a wider Pagan organisation, the EarthSpirit Community (ESC). In total, Berger underwent 11 years of fieldwork among the Pagan community. Along with ESC founder Andras Corban Arthen, Berger also undertook a [...] "Pagan Census" [...] survey of the U.S. in the mid-1990s to obtain more data on the country's Pagan community.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Suga Mama" [...] was released to British music channels in April 2007. It {{was shot in}} black-and-white and was co-directed by Melina Matsoukas alongside Knowles for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, which was released the same month; [...] "Suga Mama" [...] was one of eight videos shot in two weeks for the video album. It begins with Knowles sitting in a chair, wearing men's clothing and smoking a cigar. She gets up and begins to pole dance. The remainder of the video presents Knowles dancing {{on top of a}} sugar cube, dancing with backing dancers whose faces are partially concealed, lying in a <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> and riding a mechanical bull. Knowles said she is meant to [...] "slowly become a woman" [...] during the video, adding [...] "Well, a sexier woman – I'm always a woman." ...|$|E
50|$|He used <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> varying {{color and}} {{intensity}} to illuminate <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> on a solid surface. This set up {{was similar to}} the pieces of colored cardboard employed by von Frisch, but by using <b>light</b> instead <b>of</b> cardboard, Menzel was able to change the intensity and color <b>of</b> <b>light</b> easily. He could simply adjust the projection <b>of</b> the <b>light</b> to create a wide variety of different experimental set-ups.|$|R
40|$|The {{responses}} of bipolar {{cells in the}} retina of the turtle have been studied by intracellular recording. Two types of bipolar cell have been identified: one gave graded depolarizing and the other graded hyperpolarizing responses to small <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> (100 μm diameter). The {{responses of}} both types of cell were similar in the following respects...|$|R
60|$|He {{held up the}} lantern, and {{his hand}} shook until the <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> flickered and wavered all round us. Miss Morstan seized my wrist, and we all stood with thumping hearts, {{straining}} our ears. From the great black house there sounded through the silent night the saddest and most pitiful of sounds,--the shrill, broken whimpering of a frightened woman.|$|R
500|$|Helen Berger, then a {{lecturer}} in {{sociology at the}} West Chester University of Pennsylvania, had initially {{become involved in the}} study of the Pagan movement in preparation for a series of public lectures that she gave at the Boston Public Library in October 1986. Based on the subject of the historical witch trials that took place in New England during the Early Modern period, she devoted the final lecture in the series to an examination of the contemporary Pagan Witches, or Wiccans, then living in the area. Having yet to perform the sociological investigation that would culminate in A Community of Witches, Berger gained her information for this lecture from the information published in the works of Margot Adler, Starhawk and Marcello Truzzi, and also from a singular interview that she had carried out with a woman who was [...] "peripherally associated" [...] with Paganism. After the lecture, several audience members approached Berger to identify themselves as practicing Wiccans, and it was through them that she came into contact with the New England Pagan community. Three of the Wiccans at the lecture invited Berger to [...] "participate as a researcher" [...] as they founded their own coven, the <b>Circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>Light,</b> and she attended their weekly meetings and festival celebrations for the next two years.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the release}} of When The <b>Circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>Light</b> Begins to Fade the band toured Australia to {{celebrate}} their 10-year anniversary and also released a free E.P entitled Sombre Light 2014 - 10th Anniversary E.P [...] which contained re-recordings of material from their debut album The Sombre Light of Isolation. This release was also follow by national tours with Anathema, Amorphis and Uriah Heep.|$|E
2500|$|Tinker Bell was {{represented}} on stage by a darting light [...] "created {{by a small}} mirror held in the hand off-stage and reflecting a little <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> from a powerful lamp" [...] and her voice was [...] "a collar of bells and two special ones that Barrie brought from Switzerland". However, a Miss [...] "Jane Wren" [...] or [...] "Jenny Wren" [...] was listed among the cast on the programmes of the original productions as playing Tinker Bell: this was meant as a joke that fooled H.M. Inspector of Taxes, who sent her a tax demand.|$|E
60|$|The {{swinging}} lantern made friendly ever-changing <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> and Carl {{no longer}} feared the dangerous {{territory of the}} yard. Riding pick-a-back on Bone Stillman, he looked down contentedly on the dog's deferential tail beside them. They found Gertie asleep by the fire. She scarcely awoke as Stillman picked her up and carried her back to his shack. She nestled her downy hair beneath his chin and closed her eyes.|$|R
2500|$|The German {{scientist}} Randolf Menzel {{continued the}} study of color vision in honey bees with more detailed tests. He was curious about whether bees would learn certain colors faster than others. He used <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> various color and intensity to project <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> on a surface, a set-up like that used by von Frisch except that, by using <b>light</b> instead <b>of</b> cardboard, Menzel was able to easily change the intensity and color <b>of</b> the <b>circles.</b>|$|R
60|$|Certainly, {{even at a}} distance, her brother's {{movements}} {{suggested to}} Marguerite {{that he was in}} danger of being seen. He cowered in the darkness, tried to avoid the <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> thrown by the lamps in the passage. At all costs Marguerite felt that she must warn him that the way he was going now would lead him straight into Chauvelin's arms, and she longed to let him know that she was close by.|$|R
2500|$|Contrasting {{with some}} of the more sexual {{relationships}} of the other characters, Willow and Tara demonstrate a sentimental, soft, and consistent affection for each other. Some of this was pragmatic: the show was restricted in what it could present to viewers. Willow and Tara did not kiss until the fifth season in an episode that diverted the focus away from the display of affection when Buffy's mother dies in [...] "The Body". Before this, much of their sexuality is represented by allusions to witchcraft; spells doubled for physical affection such as an erotic ritual in [...] "Who Are You?" [...] where Willow and Tara chant and perspire in a <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> until Willow falls back on a pillow gasping and moaning. Within the Buffy universe, magic is portrayed in a mostly female realm. As opposed to it being evil, it is an earth-bound force that is most proficiently harvested by women. The treatment of the lesbian relationship as integral to magic, representative of each other (love is magic, magic is love), earned the series some critical commentary from conservative Christians. To avoid large-scale criticism, scenes had to be shot several different ways because censors would not allow some types of action on screen. In the fourth and fifth seasons, the characters could be shown on a bed, but not under the covers. Hannigan noted the inconsistent standards with the other relationships on the show: [...] "you've got Spike and Harmony just going at it like rabbits, so it's very hypocritical". As a couple, Willow and Tara are treated {{by the rest of the}} Scoobies with acceptance and little fanfare. Susan Driver writes that younger viewers especially appreciate that Willow and Tara are able to be affectionate without becoming overly sexual, thus making them objects of fantasy for male enjoyment. Willow and Tara's influence on specifically younger female viewers is, according to Driver, [...] "remarkable".|$|E

50|$|Ulexite also {{displays}} concentric <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> if {{held up to}} a light source, {{a strange}} optical property first observed by G. Donald Garlick (1991). This effect can also be produced by shining a laser pointer at a slightly oblique angle through a piece of ulexite. This optical behavior {{is a consequence of}} the different refractive indices of ulexite in different directions of polarization. Microscopic analysis of ulexite also yields cones <b>of</b> <b>light</b> that clearly emerge from each grain that is thicker than 0.1 mm under the Bertrand lens.|$|R

60|$|There {{was a more}} {{distinct}} movement {{among the}} shadows this time, as of a swift tread on the flagstones of the corridor. All else was silent round, and now she could plainly hear those footsteps running rapidly down the passage away from her. She strained her eyes to see more clearly, and anon in one <b>of</b> the dim <b>circles</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> on ahead she spied a man's figure--slender and darkly clad--walking quickly yet furtively like one pursued. As he crossed the light the man turned to look back. It was her brother Armand.|$|R
50|$|One {{player at}} a time stands at the centre <b>of</b> the <b>Circle</b> <b>of</b> Cash, a large <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>lights</b> traced out on the stage floor. The money {{is placed on the}} Circle and begins to orbit the player. Three spots are marked as tunnels, which can {{randomly}} allow the money to pass through or reverse its direction; these tunnels are located directly behind the player and to his/her left and right. A buzzer known as the Bang Button is on a pedestal before the player. When pressed, it sends a beam <b>of</b> <b>light</b> directly ahead <b>of</b> the player, out to the edge <b>of</b> the <b>circle.</b> He/she has one chance to press the Bang Button and hit the money with the beam as it passes.|$|R

60|$|He {{leaped up}} {{and raised the}} window. It was raining, but through the slow splash came the night rattle of hostile London. Staring down, he studied the desolate <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> a street-lamp cast on the wet pavement. A cat gray as dish-water, its fur worn off in spots, lean and horrible, sneaked through the <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> like the spirit of unhappiness, like London's sneer at solitary Americans in Russell Square rooms.|$|E
