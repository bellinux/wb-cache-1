25|$|It is well {{established}} that the macromolecular structure of nonviral gene delivery vectors alters their transfection efficacy and cytotoxicity. The cyclized structure has been proven to reduce cytotoxicity and increase <b>circulation</b> <b>time</b> for drug and gene delivery applications. The unique structure of cyclizing chains provides the single chain cyclized polymers a different method of interaction between the polymer and plasmid DNA, and results in a general trend of higher transfection capabilities than branched polymers. Moreover, {{due to the nature}} of the single chain structure, this cyclized polymer can “untie” to a linear chain under reducing conditions. Transfection profiles on astrocytes comparing 25 kDa-PEI, SuperFect® and Lipofectamine®2000 and cyclized polymer showed greater efficiency and cell viability whilst maintaining neural cell viability above 80% four days post transfections.|$|E
25|$|The lungs {{activate}} one hormone. The physiologically inactive decapeptide angiotensin I {{is converted}} to the aldosterone-releasing octapeptide, angiotensin II, in the pulmonary circulation. The reaction occurs in other tissues as well, but it is particularly prominent in the lungs. Angiotensin II also has a direct effect on arteriolar walls, causing arteriolar vasoconstriction, and consequently a rise in arterial blood pressure. Large amounts of the angiotensin-converting enzyme responsible for this activation are located on the surfaces of the endothelial cells of the alveolar capillaries. The converting enzyme also inactivates bradykinin. <b>Circulation</b> <b>time</b> through the alveolar capillaries is less than one second, yet 70% of the angiotensin I reaching the lungs {{is converted to}} angiotensin II in a single trip through the capillaries. Four other peptidases have been identified {{on the surface of}} the pulmonary endothelial cells.|$|E

The parameter is calculated by Genetic Algorithms, and then the carrying capacity of concrete columniation is calculated with the model. Good agreement is reached between the theoretical calculations with test results; the average relative precision is over 92 %. As a result, {{it can be used}} to analyze the carrying capacity of concrete columniation in seawater. This analysis method is intelligent...|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{hypothesized}} that elastic modulus governs the biodistribution and <b>circulation</b> <b>times</b> of particles and cells in blood; however, this notion has never been rigorously tested. We synthesized hydrogel microparticles with tunable elasticity in the physiological range, which resemble red blood cells in size and shape, and tested their behavior in vivo. Decreasing the modulus of these particles altered their biodistribution properties, allowing them to bypass several organs, such as the lung, that entrapped their more rigid counterparts, resulting in increasingly longer <b>circulation</b> <b>times</b> well past those of conventional microparticles. An 8 -fold decrease in hydrogel modulus correlated to a greater than 30 -fold increase in the elimination phase half-life for these particles.

40|$|The <b>circulation</b> <b>times</b> of {{nanoparticles}} {{range from}} {{a few hours to}} a few days. The variations in the kinetics from particle to particle are due to a range of parameters, including their adhesiveness, resistance to opsonization, and hydrodynamics. In this thesis, we examine a novel vesicle system, the polymersome, and use its circulation dynamics to deconstruct the process by which particles are cleared from the system. We then construct a model that can reflect the data available for diverse systems, including polymeric worm micelles. The model, in turn, can be used to justify the combination of the polymersome data with the cannon of liposome data available, from which we can construct trends for <b>circulation</b> <b>times</b> in terms of vesicle properties, namely PEG brush density, length, and vesicle size. We also use the model to determine relevant biological factors, such as the implication of a “Marker of Self” protein. Using the vesicle system, we determine the local forces involved in capture and uptake of vesicles. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of a PEG brush in release as a stabilizer of pores in membranes. With a truly controlled <b>circulation</b> <b>times,</b> we show that it then is possible to construct drug-vesicle combinations that can dampen the peaks and valleys in drug concentrations seen with traditional drugs. ...|$|R

30|$|The in vivo {{performance}} of micelles {{is controlled by}} several factors, such as size distribution, shape, density, deformability, and surface properties which can determine physicochemical and pathophysiological interactions. Blood stability can be affected by several factors including phagocytotic/endocytotic recognition, immune responsiveness, and vascular escape routes. In addition, if these nanoparticles are charged, they will be rapidly cleared from circulation. In contrast, neutral particles display longer <b>circulation</b> <b>times.</b> In general, micelles {{in the range of}} 10 to 200 nm are preferred since they can avoid the RES more effectively, increasing circulation half-life [88 – 90].

40|$|Magnetic {{nanoparticles}} {{have been}} extensively investigated for in vivo nanomedical {{applications in the}} last decade. PEG coating improves the solubility and stability of the nanoparticles, and provides stealth properties by preventing opsonization and subsequent removal by the reticuloendothelial system. All these effects conferred by the PEG coating are dependent on its molecular weight. Therefore, {{the selection of the}} right MW of PEG is a crucial point in the design of new nanomaterials for in vivo applications. The aim of this work lies in the in vivo optimization of the <b>circulation</b> <b>times</b> of small iron oxide nanoparticles by coating them with PEG of different MWs. PEGylated small superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (PEG-SPIONs), using PEG MWs ranging from 600 to 8000, were synthesized following a ligand exchange methodology, resulting in highly stable and water-soluble nanoparticles. Semi-quantitative and quantitative MRI studies allowed us to track the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of intravenously injected PEG-SPIONs (HD < 50 nm) in vivo up to one week. Results show that high MW PEGs (6000 – 8000) lead to nanoparticle aggregation and low MW PEGs (≤ 1500) are not able to stabilize the 6 nm iron oxide nanoparticles in physiological medium or confer stealth properties, thus leading to rapid recognition by the RES. In contrast, PEG 3000 -SPIONs show excellent in vivo behavior, they do not aggregate and they exhibit better stealth properties, giving rise to slower liver uptake and longer <b>circulation</b> <b>times.</b> In conclusion, 3000 Da {{turned out to be the}} optimal MW for the PEGylation of small nanoparticles (∼ 6 nm) designed for biomedical applications in which long <b>circulation</b> <b>times</b> together with moderate liver uptake are desirable...|$|R
