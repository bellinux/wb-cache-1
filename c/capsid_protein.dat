5|$|The three serotypes of poliovirus, PV1, PV2, and PV3, {{each have}} a {{slightly}} different <b>capsid</b> <b>protein.</b> Capsid proteins define cellular receptor specificity and virus antigenicity. PV1 {{is the most common}} form encountered in nature, but all three forms are extremely infectious. As of November 2015, wild PV1 is highly localized to regions in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Wild PV2 was declared eradicated in September 2015 after last being detected in October 1999 in Uttar Pradesh, India. As of November 2015, wild PV3 has not been seen since its 2012 detection in parts of Nigeria and Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|At the {{prenatal}} and neonatal {{stages of}} life, {{the presence of}} antibodies is provided by passive immunization from the mother. Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of antibodies, and usually appear within {{the first years of}} life. Since antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream, they are said {{to be part of the}} humoral immune system. Circulating antibodies are produced by clonal B cells that specifically respond to only one antigen (an example is a virus <b>capsid</b> <b>protein</b> fragment). Antibodies contribute to immunity in three ways: They prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells by binding to them; they stimulate removal of pathogens by macrophages and other cells by coating the pathogen; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other immune responses such as the complement pathway. Antibodies will also trigger vasoactive amine degranulation to contribute to immunity against certain types of antigens (helminths, allergens).|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis {{is caused}} by {{infection}} {{with a member of}} the genus Enterovirus known as poliovirus (PV). This group of RNA viruses colonize the gastrointestinal tract — specifically the oropharynx and the intestine. The incubation time (to the first signs and symptoms) ranges from three to 35 days, with a more common span of six to 20 days. PV infects and causes disease in humans alone. Its structure is very simple, composed of a single (+) sense RNA genome enclosed in a protein shell called a capsid. In addition to protecting the virus’s genetic material, the capsid proteins enable poliovirus to infect certain types of cells. Three serotypes of poliovirus have been identified—poliovirus type 1 (PV1), type 2 (PV2), and type 3 (PV3)—each with a slightly different <b>capsid</b> <b>protein.</b> All three are extremely virulent and produce the same disease symptoms. PV1 is the most commonly encountered form, and the one most closely associated with paralysis.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that many viral <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> have evolved on multiple occasions from functionally diverse cellular proteins. The recruitment of cellular proteins has apparently occurred at different stages of evolution, so that some cellular proteins were captured and refunctionalized prior to the divergence of cellular organisms into the three contemporary domains of life, whereas others were hijacked relatively recently. As a result, some <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> are widespread in viruses infecting distantly related organisms (e.g., <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> with the jelly-roll fold), whereas others are restricted to a particular group of viruses (e.g., <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> of alphaviruses).|$|R
40|$|To {{get access}} to the {{replication}} site, small non-enveloped DNA viruses have to cross the cell membrane using {{a limited number of}} <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins,</b> which also protect the viral genome in the extracellular environment. Most of DNA viruses have to reach the nucleus to replicate. The <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> involved in transmembrane penetration are exposed or released during endosomal trafficking of the virus. Subsequently, the conserved domains of <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> interact with cellular membranes and ensure their efficient permeabilization. This review summarizes our current knowledge concerning the role of <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> of small non-enveloped DNA viruses in intracellular membrane perturbation {{in the early stages of}} infection...|$|R

The results show that vpu-mediated facilitated export of <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> from HeLa cells does not require expression of the envelope glycoprotein. The experiments also show that export of virus <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> from HeLa cells facilitated by vpu is not affected by coexpression of either the CD 4 or CD 8 protein. The vpu protein acts in trans to facilitate export of virus <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> from HeLa cells...|$|R

25|$|The {{papillomavirus}} genome {{is divided}} into an early region (E), encoding six open reading frames (ORF) (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, and E7) that are expressed immediately after initial infection of a host cell, and a late region (L) encoding a major <b>capsid</b> <b>protein</b> L1 and a minor <b>capsid</b> <b>protein</b> L2. All viral ORFs are encoded on one DNA strand (see figure). This represents a dramatic difference between papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses, since the latter virus type expresses its early and late genes by bi-directional transcription of both DNA strands. This difference was {{a major factor in}} establishment of the consensus that papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses probably never shared a common ancestor, despite the striking similarities in the structures of their virions.|$|E

25|$|Lake Sinai virus (LSV) genomes were {{assembled}} and three main domains were discovered: Orf1, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and <b>capsid</b> <b>protein</b> sequences.

40|$|Viral <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> {{assemble}} into large, symmetrical architectures {{that are}} not found in complexes formed by their cellular counterparts. Given the prevalence of the signature jelly-roll topology in viral <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins,</b> {{we are interested in}} whether these functionally unique <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> are also structurally unique in terms of folds. To explore this question, we applied a structure-alignment based clustering of all protein chains in VIPERdb filtered at 40 % sequence identity to identify distinct capsid folds, and compared the cluster medoids with a non-redundant subset of protein domains in the SCOP database, not including the viral capsid entries. This comparison, using Template Modeling (TM) -score, identified 2078 structural "relatives" of <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> from the non-capsid set, covering altogether 210 folds following the definition in SCOP. The statistical significance of the 210 folds shared by two sets of the same sizes, estimated from 10, 000 permutation tests, is less than 0. 0001, which is an upper bound on the p-value. We thus conclude that viral <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> are segregated in structural fold space. Our result provides novel insight on how structural folds of <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins,</b> as opposed to their surface chemistry, might be constrained during evolution by requirement of the assembled cage-like architecture. Also importantly, our work highlights a guiding principle for virus-based nanoplatform design {{in a wide range of}} biomedical applications and materials science...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which Semliki Forest virus nucleocapsids are uncoated was analyzed in living cells and in vitro. In BHK- 21 cells, uncoating occurred with virtually complete efficiency within 1 to 2 min after the nucleocapsids entered the cytoplasm. It was inhibited by monensin, which blocks nucleocapsid penetration from endosomes. As previously shown for Sindbis virus (G. Wengler and G. Wengler, Virology 134 : 435 - 442, 1984), the <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> from incoming nucleocapsids became associated with ribosomes. The ribosome-bound <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> were distributed throughout the cytoplasm, while the viral RNA remained associated with vacuolar membranes. Using purified nucleocapsids and ribosomes in vitro, we established that ribosomes alone were sufficient for uncoating. Their role was to release the <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> from nucleocapsids and irreversibly sequester them, in a process independent of energy and translation. The process was stoichiometric rather than catalytic, with a maximum of three to six <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> bound to each ribosome. More than 80 % of the <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> could thus {{be removed from the}} viral RNA, resulting in the formation of nucleocapsid remnants whose sedimentation coefficients progressively decreased from 140 S to 80 S as uncoating proceeded...|$|R

25|$|The nucleocapsid, 40 {{nanometers}} in diameter, contains 240 {{copies of}} the <b>capsid</b> <b>protein</b> and has a T = 4 icosahedral symmetry. The E1 and E2 viral glycoproteins are embedded in the lipid bilayer. Single E1 and E2 molecules associate to form heterodimers. The E1-E2 heterodimers form one-to-one contacts between the E2 protein and the nucleocapsid monomers.|$|E
25|$|Like {{other members}} of the polyomavirus family, MPyV has an unenveloped {{icosahedral}} (T=7) viral capsid around 45 nanometers in diameter. The capsid contains three proteins; <b>capsid</b> <b>protein</b> VP1 is the primary component and self-assembles into a 360-unit outer capsid layer composed of 72 pentamers. The other two components, VP2 and VP3, have high sequence similarity to each other, with VP3 truncated at the N-terminus relative to VP2. VP2 and VP3 assemble inside the capsid in contact with VP1.|$|E
25|$|Like {{protease}} inhibitors, bevirimat {{and other}} maturation inhibitors interfere with protease processing of newly translated HIV polyprotein precursor, called gag. Gag {{is an essential}} structural protein of the HIV virus. Gag undergoes a chain of interactions both with itself and with other cellular and viral factors to accomplish the assembly of infectious virus particles. HIV assembly is a two-stage process involving an intermediate immature capsid that undergoes a structurally dramatic maturation to yield the infectious particle. This alteration is mediated by the viral protease, which cleaves the Gag polyprotein precursor, allowing the freed parts to reassemble to form {{the core of the}} mature virus particle. Bevirimat prevents this viral replication by specifically inhibiting cleavage of the <b>capsid</b> <b>protein</b> (CA) from the SP1 spacer protein. First, bevirimat enters a growing virus particle as it buds from an infected cell and binds to the Gag polypeptide at the CA/SP1 cleavage site. This prevents the protease enzyme from cleaving CA-SP1. As the <b>capsid</b> <b>protein</b> remains bound to SP1, the virus particle core is prevented from compressing into its normal mature shape, which is crucial for infectivity, resulting in the release of an immature, non-infectious particle.|$|E

30|$|Western Blot {{analysis}} of virus <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> was done {{as reported by}} Goszczynski et al. (1997).

The GVA and GVB-specific rabbit antisera and goat anti rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate (GAR-AP) were used diluted 1000 and 2000 times respectively.|$|R
50|$|In Human papillomavirus, two late {{proteins}} {{are involved}} in capsid formation: a major (L1) and a minor (L2) protein, in the approximate proportion 95:5%. L1 forms a pentameric assembly unit of the viral shell {{in a manner that}} closely resembles VP1 from polyomaviruses. Intermolecular disulphide bonding holds the L1 <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> together. L1 <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> can bind via its nuclear localisation signal (NLS) to karyopherins Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3) and inhibit the Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3) nuclear import pathways during the productive phase of the viral life cycle. Surface loops on L1 pentamers contain sites of sequence variation between HPV types. L2 minor <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> enter the nucleus twice during infection: in the initial phase after virion disassembly, and in the productive phase when it assembles into replicated virions along with L1 major <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins.</b> L2 proteins contain two nuclear localisation signals (NLSs), one at the N-terminal (nNLS) and the other at the C-terminal (cNLS). L2 uses its NLSs to interact with a network of karyopherins in order to enter the nucleus via several import pathways. L2 from HPV types 11 and 16 was shown to interact with karyopherins Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3). L2 <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> can also interact with viral dsDNA, facilitating its release from the endocytic compartment after viral uncoating.|$|R
25|$|Two {{different}} classes of thymidine kinases {{have been identified}} and are included in this super family: one family groups together thymidine kinase from herpesvirus as well as cellular thymidylate kinases, the second family groups TK from various sources that include, vertebrates, bacteria, the bacteriophage T4, poxviruses, African swine fever virus (ASFV) and Fish lymphocystis disease virus (FLDV). The major <b>capsid</b> <b>protein</b> of insect iridescent viruses also belongs to this family. The Prosite pattern recognizes only the cellular type of thymidine kinases.|$|E
25|$|There are high-risk HPV types, {{that are}} not {{affected}} by available vaccines. Ongoing research {{is focused on the}} development of HPV vaccines that will offer protection against a broader range of HPV types. One such method is a vaccine based on the minor <b>capsid</b> <b>protein</b> L2, which is highly conserved across HPV genotypes. Efforts for this have included boosting the immunogenicity of L2 by linking together short amino acid sequences of L2 from different oncogenic HPV types or by displaying L2 peptides on a more immunogenic carrier.|$|E

Assembly of the viron uses two scaffolding proteins, internal scaffolding protein B and external scaffolding protein D. Protein H is a multifunctional structural protein required for piloting the viral DNA into the host cell interior during the entry process. The genomes are between 5.3 and 6.2 kilobases (kb) in length.|$|E

NH 4 Cl blocks the production of infectious progeny virus in mammalian reovirus-infected cells. The inhibitory effect of NH 4 Cl is mediated by an inhibition of intracellular digestion of reovirus outer <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins.</b> In vitro digestion of viral outer <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> produces infectious partially uncoated particles, called intermediate subviral particles, which are no longer inhibited {{by the presence of}} NH 4 Cl.

50|$|Metaviridae are {{a family}} of viruses which exist as retrotransposons in a {{eukaryotic}} host’s genome. They {{are closely related to}} retroviruses: Metaviridae share many genomic elements with retroviruses, including length, organization, and genes themselves. This includes genes that encode reverse transcriptase, integrase, and <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins.</b> The reverse transcriptase and integrase proteins are needed for the retrotransposon activity of the virus. In some cases, virus-like particles can be formed from <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins.</b>|$|R
25|$|Viruses {{lacking a}} viral {{envelope}} often have complex mechanisms {{for entry into}} the host cell. MPyV <b>capsid</b> <b>protein</b> VP1 binds to sialic acids of gangliosides GD1a and GT1b on the cell surface. The functions of VP2 and VP3 are less well understood, but at least VP2 {{has been reported to}} be exposed upon endocytosis of the viral particle and may be involved in releasing the virus from the endoplasmic reticulum. MPyV has been reported to enter cells through both a caveolae-dependent endocytosis mechanism and by an independent mechanism through uncoated vesicles.|$|E
25|$|Papillomaviruses {{gain access}} to {{keratinocyte}} stem cells through small wounds, known as microtraumas, in the skin or mucosal surface. Interactions between L1 and sulfated sugars on the cell surface promote initial attachment of the virus. The virus is then able to get inside from the cell surface via interaction with a specific receptor, likely via the alpha-6 beta-4 integrin, and transported to membrane-enclosed vesicles called endosomes. The <b>capsid</b> <b>protein</b> L2 disrupts the membrane of the endosome, allowing the viral genome to escape and traffic, along with L2, to the cell nucleus.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, the DNA may be {{encapsulated}} {{in protein}} to facilitate cell entry. If this <b>capsid</b> <b>protein</b> {{is included in}} the DNA, the resulting vaccine can combine the potency of a live vaccine without reversion risks. In 1983, Enzo Paoletti and Dennis Panicali at the New York Department of Health devised a strategy to produce recombinant DNA vaccines by using genetic engineering to transform ordinary smallpox vaccine into vaccines that may be able to prevent other diseases. They altered the DNA of cowpox virus by inserting a gene from other viruses (namely Herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B and influenza).|$|E
40|$|A trans-encapsidation assay was {{established}} to study the specificity of picornavirus RNA encapsidation. A poliovirus replicon with the luciferase gene replacing the capsid protein-coding region was coexpressed in transfected HeLa cells with <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> from homologous or heterologous virus. Successful trans-encapsidation resulted in assembly and production of virions whose replication, upon subsequent infection of HeLa cells, was accompanied by expression of luciferase activity. The amount of luciferase activity was proportional {{to the amount of}} trans-encapsidated virus produced from the cotransfection. When poliovirus <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> were supplied in trans, > 2 × 106 infectious particles/ml were produced. When coxsackievirus B 3, human rhinovirus 14, mengovirus, or hepatitis A virus (HAV) <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> were supplied in trans, all but HAV showed some encapsidation of the replicon. The overall encapsidation efficiency of the replicon RNA by heterologous <b>capsid</b> <b>proteins</b> was significantly lower than when poliovirus capsid was used. trans-encapsidated particles could be completely neutralized with specific antisera against each of the donor virus capsids. The results indicate that encapsidation is regulated by specific viral nucleic acid and protein sequences...|$|R
