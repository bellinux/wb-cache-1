A floodlight of angle ff is a light that projects in a (<b>contiguous)</b> cone of <b>angle</b> at most ff. A floodlight placed in a simple polygon with its apex at a vertex, aimed entirely interior to the polygon, is called a vertex floodlight; if it has angle at most ff, we will call it a vertex ff-light.

The question of illuminating a polygon with vertex floodlights was first explored in [3], in which it was established that every orthogonal polygon [...] ...|$|R

The NEP is an undistinguished region of moderate Galactic latitude, b= 298, and hence suitable for compiling statistical samples of both galactic and extragalactic objects. We have made such a compilation in the 80. 6 deg^ 2 region surrounding the NEP. Our sample fully exploits {{the properties of the}} RASS, since the only criteria for inclusion are source position and significance, and yields the deepest large solid <b>angle</b> <b>contiguous</b> sample of X-ray sources to date. We find 442 unique sources above a flux limit ∼ 2 × 10 ^- 14 ergs c̃m^- 2 s^- 1 in the 0. 5 [...] 2. 0 keV band. In this paper we present the X-ray properties of these sources as determined from the RASS. These include positions, fluxes, spectral information in the form of hardness ratios, and angular sizes. Since we have performed a comprehensive optical identification program we also present the average X-ray properties of classes of objects typical of the X-ray sky at these flux levels.

We see spectral evolution in the hardening of the sources at fluxes below 10 (exp - 14) ergs/sq cm/s, which agrees with previous observations from Chandra and XMM-Newton.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{quantitative}} evaluation of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data {{seemed to be}} extremely important for clinical research its application is under debate. Besides fractional anisotropy (FA) the quantitative comparison between hemispheres {{of the number of}} fibers reconstructed by means of diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) is commonly used. However, the tractography-related parameters FA, minimum tract length (LENGTH) and the <b>angle</b> between two <b>contiguous</b> tracking steps (<b>ANGLE)</b> are inconsistently applied. Using 18 combinations we tested for the influence of parameter thresholds on the amount of reconstructed fibers for the posterior pyramidal tract in both hemispheres in order to obtain meaningful thresholds for DTT. RESULTS: In 14 chronic stroke patients with unilateral lesions of the pyramidal tract around the height of the internal capsule and considerable motor deficits a 3 -way repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant interaction between the effects of FA and ANGLE level on reconstructed fiber lateralization, F (2. 9, 37. 67)  =  3. 01, p =  0. 044, and a significant main effect FA, F (1. 4, 18. 1)  =  11. 58, p =  0. 001. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons showed that this interaction was completely driven by FA. In 22 right-handed healthy subjects no significant interactions or main effects could be found. CONCLUSION: The parameter threshold combinations with highest FA showed highest effect. ANGLE and LENGTH insofar influenced the lateralization effect when selected as liberal as possible, short LENGTH and large ANGLE thresholds. The DTT approach should be used with great care since results are highly dependent on the thresholds applied...|$|R

A total of 233 and 252 sources with spectroscopic information {{are used in the}} study of the CLASXS and CDFN fields respectively. We calculate both redshift-space and projected correlation functions in co-moving coordinates, averaged over the redshift range of 0. 1 < z < 3. 0, for both CLASXS and CDFN fields for a standard cosmology with Omega(sub Lambda) = 0. 73,Omega(sub M) = 0. 27, and h = 0. 71 (H(sub 0) = 100 h km/s Mpc(exp - 1). The correlation function for the CLASXS field over scales of 3 Mpc< s < 200 Mpc can be modeled as a power-law of the form xi(s) = (S/SO) (exp - gamma), with gamma = 1. 6 (sup + 0. 4 sub - 0. 3) and S(sub o) = 8. 0 (sup +. 14 sub - 1. 5) Mpc. The redshift-space correlation function for CDFN on scales of 1 Mpc< s < 100 Mpc is found to have a similar correlation length so = 8. 55 (sup + 0. 74 sub - 0. 74) Mpc, but a shallower slope (gamma = 1. 3 +/- 0. 1). The real-space correlation functions derived from the projected correlation functions, are found to be tau(sub 0 = 8. 1 (sup + 1. 2 sub - 2. 2) Mpc, and gamma = 2. 1 +/- 0. 5 for the CLASXS field, and tau(sub 0) = 5. 8 (sup +. 1. 0 sub - 1. 5) Mpc, gamma = 1. 38 (sup + 0. 12 sub - 0. 14 for the CDFN field. By comparing the real- and redshift-space correlation functions in the combined CLASXS and CDFN samples, we are able to estimate the redshift distortion parameter Beta = 0. 4 +/- 0. 2 at an effective redshift z = 0. 94. We compare the correlation functions for hard and soft spectra sources in the CLASXS field and find no significant difference between the two groups. We have also found that the correlation between X-ray luminosity and clustering amplitude is weak, which, however, is fully consistent with the expectation using the simplest relations between X-ray luminosity, black hole mass, and dark halo mass. We study the evolution of the AGN clustering by dividing the samples into 4 redshift bins over 0. 1 Mpc< z < 3. 0 Mpc. We find a very mild evolution in the clustering amplitude, which show the same evolution trend found in optically selected quasars in the 2 dF survey. We estimate the evolution of the bias, and find that the bias increases rapidly with redshift (b(z = 0. 45) = 0. 95 +/- 0. 15 and b(z = 2. 07) = 3. 03 +/- 0. 83) : The typical mass of the dark matter halo derived from the bias estimates show little change with redshift.
