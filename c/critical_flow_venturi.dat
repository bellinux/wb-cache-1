In this thesis, {{we focus}} on the {{bandwidth}} allocation on the bottleneck link and provide several allocation schemes to minimize the potential damage caused by flooding attacks. Assume that we know which <b>flows</b> are <b>critical</b> <b>flows,</b> and all other flows on the bottleneck link are considered as suspicious flows [4], when the delivery path is under attacks. The proposed schemes try to provide more bandwidth to <b>critical</b> <b>flows</b> and reduce damages as much as possible. Using these schemes, the system can properly allocate the bandwidth among <b>critical</b> <b>flows</b> and suspicious flows on the bottleneck link. At the same time, the congestion of the bottleneck link will be identified and the non-critical flows are tagged as suspicious flows.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{estimate}} myocardial oxygen needs {{by studying}} the effects of reduced coronary blood flow on segmental myocardial function. To study the tolerance of limited oxygen supply to a myocardial segment during propofol administration. DESIGN: A prospective experimental study. SETTING: An experimental animal laboratory in a university. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen adult dogs, weighing 20 to 35 kg. INTERVENTIONS: Open thorax open pericardium experiments were performed under standard anesthetic conditions. Segment length gauges were placed subendocardially in an anteroapical and in a basal segment. Flow to the anteroapical segment was reduced by tightening a micrometer-controlled snare placed around the second diagonal coronary artery. Left ventricular pressure-length signals allowed for identification of onset of relaxation dysfunction. Myocardial tissue flow at onset of relaxation dysfunction was defined as <b>critical</b> <b>flow.</b> Tracer microspheres were used to measure subepicardial, midwall, and subendocardial <b>flow</b> at <b>critical</b> <b>flow.</b> MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Stability of the model and reproducibility of <b>critical</b> <b>flow</b> were studied in a first series of six dogs with the hearts paced at 110 beats/min. Hemodynamics, left ventricular, and segmental myocardial function during <b>critical</b> <b>flow</b> were stable. Subendocardial <b>critical</b> <b>flow</b> was identical with each flow reduction (45 % +/- 5, 44 % +/- 8, and 43 % +/- 5 of baseline myocardial tissue flow). In a second series of six dogs, <b>critical</b> <b>flow</b> was measured at pacing rates 100 beats/min, 150 beats/min, and 100 beats/min with propranolol, 0. 1 mg/kg, pretreatment. <b>Critical</b> <b>flows</b> were 38 % +/- 5, 55 % +/- 6, and 17 % +/- 2 of baseline, respectively (p < 0. 05). In a third series of six dogs, <b>critical</b> <b>flow</b> was measured during sufentanil, 0. 6 microgram/kg/min, and increasing doses of propofol (P 0 : 0. 0 mg/kg/h, P 4 : 4. 0 mg/kg/h and P 8 : 8. 0 mg/kg/h). Heart rate was kept constant at 110 beats/min. When compared with P 0, hemodynamic and left ventricular contraction parameters were stable at P 4 but were decreased at P 8. At P 0, <b>critical</b> <b>flow</b> was: 0. 63 +/- 0. 14, at P 4 : 0. 34 +/- 0. 09, and at P 8 : 0. 25 +/- 0. 07 mL/min/g (p < 0. 05).
