50|$|While it is {{challenging}} to define over-indebtedness, definitions of over-indebtedness {{tend to have}} a few core elements in common. The first one refers to the capacity to meet the expenses associated with the <b>contracted</b> financial <b>commitments.</b> Over-indebtedness implies an inability to meet such recurring expenses. Second, this inability is structural. This is the time dimension, which holds that the definition must capture persistent and ongoing financial problems and exclude one-off occurrences that arise due to forgetfulness, for instance. The third core element refers to standard of living. The household must be unable to meet <b>contracted</b> <b>commitments</b> without reducing its minimum standard of living expenses. Fourth, comes illiquidity. The household is unable to remedy the situation by recourse to (financial and non-financial) assets and other financial sources such as credit. Lastly, all <b>contracted</b> financial <b>commitments</b> are included, among them mortgage and consumer credit commitments, utility and telephone bills as well as rent payments (recurring expenses).|$|R

5000|$|He came to Laredo Junior College as the dean-register in 1949, {{two years}} after its {{establishment}} by the Laredo Independent School District. In 1960, he succeeded the founding president, W. J. Adkins. During his 14-year presidential tenure, LJC acquired new buildings and federal grants. The nursing program was added, and enrollment expanded. In 1964, Laird authorized a master plan for the accommodation of a college for at least 1,500 students, but enrollment reached nearly four thousand {{by the time that}} Laird retired as president in 1974 at the age of sixty-seven, and the leadership passed to the third president, Domingo Arechiga. Campus buildings, all within close proximity to one another, are named for Adkins, Laird, and Arechiga. [...] An unusual personnel case dogged Laird during his last years as president. A tenured history professor, Lyndon L. Daly, began to argue that LJC, as it was then known, should grant greater governance by the faculty, rather than the administration. Daly headed the American Association of University Professors chapter on the LJC campus and was the vice-chairman of the Faculty Senate. After four years at the institution, Daly disappeared without giving notice that he was undergoing medical treatment in Houston, Texas. Laird terminated Daly's employment after several attempts to locate him failed. He had changed his Laredo address and disconnected his telephone. Two years later, Daly filed suit for $50,000 in damages on a claim of wrongful termination and infringement upon his right to free speech and the right of association. The jury awarded him $8,000 in punitive damages. LJC then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans, Louisiana, and obtained in 1974, as Laird was leaving the institution, the cancellation of the damages considering the circumstances of Daly's departure from the school. The court declared that [...] "There is no indication in the record of any desire of the college to dismiss the plaintiff for any reason other than his failure to honor his <b>contract</b> <b>commitment</b> to them. There are no facts to support the conclusion that an abridgement of the plaintiff's First Amendment rights took place ...". Laird retired to Kerrville in Kerr County in the Texas Hill Country with his wife, Helen S. Laird (1915-1977). The couple had a son, Charles William Laird of Wilmore in Jessamine County near Lexington, Kentucky. He also had two sisters, Ruth Margaret Carmin (1917-2012) of Wellington in Iroquois County, Illinois, and Rosemary L. Stone (1923-2010) of Williamsport in western Indiana, and three brothers, Reed Laird of Waukegan near Chicago, Illinois, and Robert C. [...] "Bob" [...] Laird (1927-1995) and Russell [...] "Jack" [...] Laird (1920-2002), both of Rolla in Phelps County in south central Missouri.

40|$|Risk {{management}} and efficient, well coordinated, flow-scheduling have {{an increasingly important}} role in the competitive pork production networks. Changes in input and output prices have resulted in distortions in the Finnish pig markets during the last years. The goal {{of this study is to}} estimate how different price or quantity-fixing contracts affect the values of pig and sow space unit under price risk. The values are estimated with two stochastic dynamic programming models. The results suggest that a contract which is able to control both the pattern of changes in piglet prices and the option to suspend production temporarily has a value and it can help to improve the competitiveness of the pig sector. However, it is feasible to have incentives towards the <b>contract</b> <b>commitment</b> when market situation upon accepting the commitment is favourable. vo...|$|E

40|$|An input {{supplier}} {{selling to}} competing downstream firms {{would benefit from}} publicly committing at the outset to all <b>contracts.</b> Efficient <b>commitment,</b> however, would require complete contracts. The authors study instead bilateral <b>contracting,</b> without <b>commitment</b> regarding others' terms.

The authors show that nondiscrimination clauses generally cannot curb such third-party opportunism, even with symmetric firms. To reassure firms, crude forms of commitment may be adopted. This could explain the pervasiveness of exclusivity arrangements and the striking uniformity and intertemporal rigidity of franchise contracts.

The first one focuses {{on the evolution of}} the program-theory which underlie the French agri-environmental policy, from a retrospective of the successive national schemes set up since 1985. The second part questions the role of territories and local actors in the program definition and implementation. We question the supposed "territorialization" of LAES, by leaning on a comparative study of the program in three regions of Southwest France. Our first results suggest that beyond the integration of spatial stakes in conformity with the Water Framework Directive, the LAES remains after all little territorialized and can be considered rather as a top-down site-specific pollution control policy.

The present study is based on 52 organizations in Norway and 665 respondents voluntary participating in this project. Data was collected at the organizational and at the employee level. Multilevel analyses were therefore utilized in analyzing the data. The results of the present study revealed a statistically significant relationship between market-oriented culture and employee performance.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between on the 1 hand psychological contract fulfilment and affective commitment {{and on the other}} hand, normative commitment and job satisfaction. We hypothesized that the perceived supervisor support (PSS) and the perceived organizational support (POS) mediate {{the relationship between}} the fulfilment of the psychological <b>contract,</b> <b>commitment</b> and job satisfaction. The sample consists in 337 soldiers in training. In order to test our model, we used 3 measures of psychological contract fulfilment (economic, socioemotional and developmental), PSS and POS measures as well as attitudes. Results show that the developmental psychological contract is related to affective and normative organizational commitment and job satisfaction whereas socioemotional fulfilment is unrelated to affective commitment. Psychological contract fulfilment has a greater impact on normative commitment than affective commitment. Results show also that only PSS plays a mediating role in psychological contract processes. Several implications emerge from this study. First, in a military context, it is important to strengthen the developmental psychological contract. Second, it is essential for organizations to place greater emphasis on encouraging supervisors to establish healthy working relationships with newcomers.
