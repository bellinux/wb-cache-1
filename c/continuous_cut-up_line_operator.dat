40|$|A {{detailed}} study of half-BPS <b>line</b> <b>operators</b> of higher rank 4 d N= 2 theory engineered from six dimensional A_{N- 1 } (2, 0) theory on a bordered Riemann surface with full marked points is performed. Geometrically, each 4 d UV <b>line</b> <b>operator</b> is represented by an irreducible bipartite web formed by three junctions on Riemann surface, and such web structure is called higher lamination. Algebraically, the space of UV <b>line</b> <b>operators</b> is identified with the integral tropical a coordinates of the corresponding PGL(N,C) local system, and the space of IR <b>line</b> <b>operator</b> is identified with the cluster X coordinates of SL(N. C) local system. The expectation value of UV <b>line</b> <b>operator</b> at Coulomb branch parameterized by X coordinates is calculated, {{and the result is}} a positive Laurent polynomial in X. Using the expectation values, we calculate the operator product expansion (OPE) between the <b>line</b> <b>operators,</b> which is then represented geometrically by higher rank Skein relations. We also calculate the Poisson brackets of these <b>line</b> <b>operators,</b> and Frenchel-Nielson type coordinates are constructed for Higher Teichmuller space, etc. Comment: 59 pages, 37 figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Geometric {{picture of}} <b>line</b> <b>operators</b> of N = 2 class S {{theories}} {{was found by}} imposing closure condition on operator product expansion (OPE) of <b>line</b> <b>operators.</b> In this paper, we first identify the geometric representation of ordinary Wilson-’t Hooft <b>line</b> <b>operators</b> of field theory, and study duality action on them. We further define a Dirac product between <b>line</b> <b>operators</b> and classify the allowed set of <b>line</b> <b>operators</b> by requiring: a: closure of OPE; b: mutual locality; c: maximality. Using above classifications, we find many distinct gauge theories associated with a single duality frame, and show explicitly that new possibilities correspond to the choice of global form of gauge group and discrete θ angles. We also study S and T duality actions relating those theories. In particular, we find very interesting duality webs for Maldacena-Nunez theory. ar X i...|$|R

40|$|Non-perturbative {{aspects of}} N= 2 supersymmetric gauge {{theories}} of class S are deeply encoded in the algebra of functions on the moduli space M_flat of flat SL(N) -connections on Riemann surfaces. Expectation values of Wilson and 't Hooft <b>line</b> <b>operators</b> {{are related to}} holonomies of flat connections, and expectation values of <b>line</b> <b>operators</b> in the low-energy effective theory are related to Fock-Goncharov coordinates on M_flat. Via the decomposition of UV <b>line</b> <b>operators</b> into IR <b>line</b> <b>operators,</b> we determine their noncommutative algebra from the quantization of Fock-Goncharov Laurent polynomials, and find that it coincides with the skein algebra studied {{in the context of}} Chern-Simons theory. Another realization of the skein algebra is generated by Verlinde network operators in Toda field theory. Comparing the spectra of these two realizations provides non-trivial support for their equivalence. Our results can be viewed as evidence for the generalization of the AGT correspondence to higher-rank class S theories. Comment: 90 pages, 49 figure...|$|R

However, we need to refine the expansion by including additional novel monopole bubbling contributions to obtain a precise match. Using D-brane realization of these singular BPS <b>line</b> <b>operators,</b> we derive and incorporate the monopole bubbling contributions as well as predict the degeneracies of framed BPS states contributing to the <b>line</b> <b>operator</b> vevs {{in the limit of}} vanishing simultaneous spatial and R-symmetry rotation fugacity parameter.

After reducing on S 1, the expansion of the vevs of the <b>line</b> <b>operators</b> in the IR provides a new physical interpretation of the “Darboux coordinates” on the moduli spaceM of the theory.
