40|$|The {{environmental}} {{burdens of}} Chinese copper production {{have been identified}} and quantified {{in the context of}} typical technologies, materials supplies and environmental emissions by a life cycle approach. Primary and secondary copper production using <b>copper</b> ores and <b>scraps,</b> respectively, were analyzed in detail. The flash and bath smelting approaches and the recycling of <b>copper</b> <b>scraps</b> were selected as representative copper production processes. A quantitative analysis was also conducted to assess the influence of material transport distance in copper production.

In addition, the secondary copper production has dramatically lower environmental burdens than the primary production. There is no obvious distinction in overall environmental burdens in primary copper production by flash or bath smelting approach. However, resources depletion is lower and the damage to human health is higher for flash smelting approach. Ecosystem quality damage is slight for both approaches. Environmental burdens from the mining stage contribute most in all life cycle stages in primary copper production. In secondary copper production, the electrolytic refining stage dominates.

A quantitative assessment of the significance of virtually all materials to the U. K. is made. Copper is identified {{as one of the most}} important materials deserving of further investigation into potential resource savings through increased recycling. The other factors listed above are accounted for in the modelling technique employed. United Kingdom copper flows are qualitatively and statistically described for the years 1949 - 1976. Less accurate statistics are developed for 1922 - 1948. Adaptive expectations type causal models of total, unalloyed, and alloyed copper demand are successfully constructed and are used to generate future scenarios. Evidence is demonstrated for a break in the historical link between U. K. copper demand and industrial production. Simple causal models of potential <b>copper</b> <b>scrap</b> supply are constructed and a comparison made with actual old scrap withdrawals. Accurate adaptive expectations type models of total scrap demand are developed, but no conclusion is reached about the price elasticity of scrap demand. Various scenarios of copper goods demand are forecast and their effect on <b>copper</b> <b>scrap</b> demand. The potential to recover up to an extra 100. 000 tonnes/year of generally lower grade old scrap is identified.

Light scrap of reactive {{metals and alloys}} containing reactive elements is diffifult to recyle by conventional methods of melting. At the Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL), Hyderabad, electroslag melting technologies {{have been developed for}} recycling light scrap of valuable metals and alloys such as superalloys and oxygen free high conductivity (OFHC) copper. Conventionally, electroslag melting processes use consumable electrodes. Because of the difficulty in compaction of scrap into a consumable electrode of satisfactory quality, non-consumable electrodes such as graphite and water-cooled copper have been designed. Electroslag remelting using water-cooled non-consumable electrode was used to melt scrap of a nickel base superalloy. Sound ingots with smooth surface finish and properties comparable to vacuum melted superalloys could be obtained from scrap using this process. OFHC <b>copper</b> <b>scrap</b> was melted by a modified electroslag crucible melting process using graphite crucible and graphite electrode.
