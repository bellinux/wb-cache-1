40|$|The daytime net {{ecosystem}} {{exchange of}} CO 2 (NEE) {{was measured in}} an even-aged slash pine plantation in northern Florida from 1999 to 2001 using the eddy covariance technique. In August 2000, two <b>clear-cuts</b> were formed approximately 1 km west of the study site. A statistical approach {{was used to determine}} whether the <b>clear-cuts</b> induced changes in CO 2 concentration, wind direction, horizontal and vertical wind speeds, and temperature, as measured by instruments above the plantation canopy and, in turn, whether any such changes affected daytime NEE. The NEE estimates were first transformed so that mean responses to incident radiation and vapor pressure deficit were removed using empirically derived functions for each 30 -min period. Prior to the <b>clear-cuts,</b> there were significant interactive effects of CO 2 concentration and some wind statistics on NEE at the tower when wind was flowing {{from the direction of the}} future <b>clear-cuts.</b> Even in this relatively homogenous forest, with flat topography, the CO 2 source strength differed with wind direction prior to the <b>clear-cuts.</b> After the <b>clear-cuts,</b> additional two- and three-way interactive effects became significant during flows from the direction of the <b>clear-cuts.</b> There was also a 16. 6 % reduction in the integrated measure of daytime NEE over 487 days after the <b>clear-cuts.</b> The results herein suggest that the development of local circulations over the <b>clear-cuts</b> contributed to low-frequency effects on the NEE. 1...|$|R
40|$|Land-use {{history has}} been {{recognized}} as {{an important factor in}} shaping biological communities in <b>clear-cuts.</b> Many solitary bees and flower beetles (Cerambycidae: Lepturinae) are commonly found in <b>clear-cuts,</b> which serve as early successional habitats. I analyzed the effect of land-use history on the abundance and species richness, as well as the preference for land-use history in specific species, of solitary bees and flower beetles in coniferous <b>clear-cuts</b> in southern Sweden. Additionally, the effect of site-specific environmental factors was examined. Insects were caught with blue, white and yellow pan-traps in 48 <b>clear-cuts,</b> of which half were meadow and half were forest in the 1870 s. With few exceptions, the species found did not show preference for any land-use history. Furthermore, land-use history had no significant effect on the abundance or species richness of solitary bees or flower beetles. This may be due to pan-traps being less attractive in flower-rich locations, a bias in the sampling method. However, species richness and abundance of solitary bees was higher in young <b>clear-cuts</b> (2 - 4 years old), probably best explained by more exposed soil and higher frequencies of flowering plants in newer <b>clear-cuts.</b> Abundance of flower beetles was higher in old <b>clear-cuts</b> (6 - 8 years old). This may be due to larger amounts of more strongly decomposed wood in older <b>clear-cuts,</b> which is used in the flower beetles´ larval development. I conclude that solitary bees are likely to benefit if <b>clear-cuts,</b> particularly with meadow history, are kept more open by introducing disturbance regimes, as suggested by previous studies...|$|R

40|$|Logging residue and cut stumps are {{increasingly}} {{used as a}} renewable energy source known as forest fuel. Forest fuel harvesting obviously reduces the volume of dead wood {{and is likely to}} alter the dead wood composition, but the magnitude of the change is not known. Such information is important for the evaluation of the effects of forest fuel harvesting on biodiversity because a large proportion of forest dwelling species are directly dependent on dead wood. We measured the volume and characteristics of all dead wood units with a minimum diameter of 2 cm and a minimum length of 20 cm on 10 forest-fuel harvested and 10 traditional (control) <b>clear-cuts.</b> The total volume of dead wood at forest fuel harvested and control <b>clear-cuts</b> was 26. 0 and 42. 3 m 3 /ha, respectively. The volumes were much greater than expected suggesting that the volume of dead wood on <b>clear-cuts</b> has been underestimated in previous studies. Forest fuel harvested <b>clear-cuts</b> had 42 % less branches and 81 % less cut stumps than control <b>clear-cuts</b> but there were no differences in the volume of logs and pieces of logs, snags or roots. The volume of fine woody debris was negatively affected by forest fuel harvesting. We conclude that fine woody debris and cut stumps form a considerable resource on <b>clear-cuts</b> that is reduced by forest fuel harvesting. These components of dead wood have potential to be of importance in managed forests and thus deserve more attention in future biodiversity studies...|$|R

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} Timber-oriented forest {{management}} alters the environmental conditions, threatening {{the survival of}} many native and rare arthropod species. Recognition of the scale and effects of the forest loss {{has resulted in a}} considerable degree of interest in the reforestation. Nowadays, the uneven-aged management is recommended during the reforestation procedure, because this is less intensive and could be less harmful than even-aged practices. Our aim was to test the effects of <b>clear-cutting</b> (as even-aged method) and group selection harvesting (as uneven-aged method) on forest specialist epigaeic arthropods.   Material and methods Epigaeic arthropod assemblages (ground beetles, spiders and woodlice) in gaps harvested by group selection and <b>clear-cuts</b> were compared to those assemblages in windthrow gaps and mature forest stands. Ground beetles, spiders and woodlice were collected by litter sifting.   Results The total number of epigaeic arthropod species was significantly higher in the gaps harvested by group selection than in the <b>clear-cuts</b> and the mature forests. The species richness of forest specialist species was significantly lower in the <b>clear-cuts</b> than in the other habitats.   Conclusion Our findings demonstrated that the conventional <b>clear-cutting</b> caused a {{decrease in the number of}} forest specialist species.

50|$|Environmental groups criticize <b>clear-cutting</b> as {{destructive}} to water, soil, wildlife, and atmosphere, and recommend {{the use of}} sustainable alternatives. <b>Clear-cutting</b> has a very big impact on the water cycle. Trees hold water and topsoil. <b>Clear-cutting</b> in forests removes the trees which {{would otherwise have been}} transpiring large volumes of water and also physically damages the grasses, mosses, lichens, and ferns populating the understorey. All this bio-mass normally retains water during rainfall. Removal or damage of the biota reduces the local capacity to retain water, which can exacerbate flooding and lead to increased leaching of nutrients from the soil. The maximum nutrient loss occurs around year two, and returns to pre-clearcutting levels by year four.|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{analyzed}} {{the responses of}} small mammals to <b>clear-cutting</b> in temperate and boreal forests in Europe. We conducted a meta-analysis of published research on most often studied small mammal species (the striped field mouse, the yellow-necked mouse, the wood mouse, the field vole, the common vole, the bank vole, the Eurasian harvest mouse, the common shrew and the Eurasian pygmy shrew), comparing their abundance on <b>clear-cuts</b> and in unharvested stands. For four other species (the gray-sided vole, the Siberian flying squirrel, the Eurasian red squirrel and the hazel dormouse), we provide a qualitative review of their responses to forest harvest. Results of the meta-analysis suggest that common species of small mammals usually increase in abundance after <b>clear-cutting</b> or are unaffected by this disturbance. As an exception, the yel-low-necked mouse declines after <b>clear-cutting</b> in boreal but not in temperate forest. The qualitative review suggests that the responses of more specialized (e. g., arboreal) species to forest harvest are more varied than the responses of generalist species included in the meta-analysis. For some species of small mammals (e. g., the Siberian flying squirrel), habitat loss resulting from forest harvest is a major threat...|$|R

The hypothesis that soil bacterial communities would become {{similar to those of}} surrounding intact primary forest with natural regeneration was supported by the shifts in the bacterial community composition and structure. Bacterial community diversity patterns induced by <b>clear-cutting</b> were consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Dynamics of bacterial communities was mostly driven by soil properties, which collectively explained more than 70 % of the variation in bacterial community composition. Community assembly data revealed that <b>clear-cutting</b> promoted the importance of the deterministic processes in shaping bacterial communities, coinciding with the resultant low resource environments. But assembly processes in the secondary forest returned a similar level compared to the intact primary forest. These findings suggest that bacterial community dynamics may be predictable during the natural recovery process...|$|R

40|$|Human {{activities}} can impact animal communities by altering species interactions. The influence of forest harvesting on {{the interaction between}} threatened boreal caribou, moose, and wolves constitutes a classic example. When conifer forests are logged, <b>clear-cuts</b> are colonized by deciduous vegetation that provides high-quality food for moose. Subsequent changes in wolf distribution alter predation risk for caribou. Given that primary productivity varies along latitudinal gradients, the effects of logging on moose-caribou-wolf interactions could also vary moving northwards. Empirical evidence, however, is lacking and current recommendations for caribou conservation are fixed over space. We assessed whether the impact of logging activities on caribou-moose-wolf interactions varies with latitude. We estimated deciduous vegetation availability from satellite imagery, and followed all three species with GPS collars to evaluate their habitat selection. We found that the availability of deciduous vegetation in logged stands decreased along a 400 -km latitudinal gradient. The probability of caribou occurrence remained low in <b>clear-cuts,</b> regardless of deciduous vegetation availability. Moose and wolves increased their selection for <b>clear-cuts</b> as they contained more deciduous vegetation. Accordingly, the relative co-occurrence probability of moose and wolves was strongly associated with <b>clear-cuts</b> at low latitudes, but weakly so at high latitudes. <b>Clear-cuts</b> should therefore attract moose and wolves more strongly to prime boreal caribou habitat at lower latitudes, and caribou predation risk should follow similar geographical patterns. Conservation planning should account for geographical patterns in the risk faced by threatened populations because the effectiveness of strategies developed from average patterns can decrease over space, in consistent manner...|$|R
