In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, U.S. President Barack Obama announced that Clinton and George W. Bush would coordinate efforts to raise funds for Haiti's recovery. Clinton continues to visit Haiti to witness the inauguration of refugee villages, and to raise funds for victims of the earthquake. In 2010, Clinton announced support of, and delivered the keynote address for, the inauguration of NTR, Ireland's first environmental foundation. At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, Clinton gave a widely praised speech nominating Barack Obama.|$|E
5|$|The highway was {{constructed}} from1926to1935. Route31 has carried two different {{numbers in the}} past. It was known as Route30 between1927and1953, when it was renumbered to Route69 to avoid conflicting with US30 in southern New Jersey. It was renumbered to Route31 in 1967 due to sign theft that resulted from the sexual meaning of the number69. There were plans made in the late1960s and early1970s to build a freeway in the Route31 corridor that would begin in the Trenton area and extend {{as far north as}} Interstate84 (I-84) in Port Jervis, New York; however, it was canceled in the mid-1970s due to opposition from area residents and environmental and financial constraints. In recent years, the portion of Route31 between Flemington and <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> widened to four lanes. In addition, there was a failed project to build a bypass of Flemington that would have also eliminated the Flemington Circle.|$|E

500|$|Former US President Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{a member}} of the club since May 2003.

5000|$|Former President Barack Obama {{and former}} United States Secretary of State Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> very {{supportive}} of good {{relations between the two}} countries and more cooperation on more issues more often.

However, <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> said that there is no G-2.|$|R
500|$|<b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{criticized for}} not {{including}} enough details about the Monica Lewinsky scandal and his impeachment. One of the 14 alcoves {{is dedicated to the}} [...] "politics of persecution" [...] and is titled The Fight For Power. The alcove includes the Lewinsky affair, the Whitewater scandal, and the Republican Contract with America. Ralph Applebaum, the chief exhibit designer for the center, said that Clinton was heavily involved in the alcove's design, and that Clinton [...] "insisted on a transparent and illuminating exhibition". The scandal is portrayed as a power struggle between Republicans in Congress and Clinton after the Republican Party took control of both the House of Representatives and Senate in 1994.|$|E
500|$|Clinton {{left office}} with the highest end-of-office {{approval}} rating of any U.S. president since World War II, and he has continually received high ratings in public opinion polls of U.S. presidents. Since leaving office, <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the William J. Clinton Foundation to address international causes, such as the prevention of AIDS and global warming. He has remained active in politics by campaigning for Democratic candidates, including his wife's presidential campaigns and Barack Obama's presidential campaigns. In 2004, Clinton published his autobiography, My Life. In 2009, Clinton was named the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti and after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, he teamed with George W. Bush to form the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund.|$|E
500|$|Going {{into the}} early stages of her presidential {{campaign}} for 2008, a Time magazine cover showed a large picture of her, with two checkboxes labeled [...] "Love Her", [...] "Hate Her", while Mother Jones titled its profile of her [...] "Harpy, Hero, Heretic: Hillary". Democratic netroots activists consistently rated Clinton very low in polls of their desired candidates, while some conservative figures such as Bruce Bartlett and Christopher Ruddy were declaring a Hillary Clinton presidency not so bad after all. An October 2007 cover of The American Conservative magazine was titled [...] "The Waning Power of Hillary Hate". By December 2007, communications professor Jamieson observed that there was a large amount of misogyny present about Clinton on the Internet, up to and including instances on Facebook and other sites devoted to depictions reducing Clinton to sexual humiliation. She noted, in response to widespread comments on Clinton's laugh, that [...] "We know that there's language to condemn female speech that doesn't exist for male speech. We call women's speech shrill and strident. And Hillary Clinton's laugh was being described as a cackle." [...] The [...] "bitch" [...] epithet, which had been applied to Clinton going back to her first lady days and had been seen by Karrin Vasby Anderson as a tool of containment against women in American politics, flourished during the campaign, especially on the Internet but via conventional media as well. Following Clinton's [...] "choked up moment" [...] and related incidents {{in the run-up to the}} January 2008 New Hampshire primary, both The New York Times and Newsweek found that discussion of gender's role in the campaign had moved into the national political discourse. Newsweek editor Jon Meacham summed the relationship between Clinton and the American public by saying that the New Hampshire events [...] "brought an odd truth to light: though Hillary Rodham <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> on the periphery or in the middle of national life for decades ... she is one of the most recognizable but least understood figures in American politics." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{criticized for}} not giving credit to a ghostwriter in {{connection}} with It Takes a Village. [...] The majority of the book was reportedly written by ghostwriter Barbara Feinman. When the book was first announced in April 1995, The New York Times reported publisher Simon & Schuster as saying [...] "The book will actually be written by Barbara Feinman, a journalism professor at Georgetown University in Washington. Ms. Feinman will conduct {{a series of interviews}} with Mrs. Clinton, who will help edit the resulting text." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{book was}} {{generally}} hostile towards Bill Clinton, including {{the inclusion of}} coverage about his new numerous supposed (at that time) affairs. As the New York Times wrote, [...] "Clearly the President is the seducer of the title -- Mr. Brock quotes a former White House aide, David Watkins, calling Bill Clinton the greatest seducer who ever lived -- and to the degree Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> forced to compromise the high moral and ethical standards she brought both to their political partnership and their marriage, Mr. Brock blames Bill Clinton. Indeed, his characterization of the President is consistently scathing, at times approaching an ad hominem attack." ...|$|E
6000|$|Andr√© met {{the result}} with manly firmness. Even in this {{situation}} of gathering horrors, he thought of others more than of himself. [...] "There is only one thing that disturbs my tranquillity," [...] said he to Hamilton. [...] "Sir Henry <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> too good to me; he has been lavish of his kindness. I am bound to him by too many obligations, and love him too well, to bear the thought that he should reproach himself, or others should reproach him, on the supposition of my having conceived myself obliged, by his instructions, to run the risk I did. I would not for the world leave a sting in his mind that should embitter his future days." [...] He could scarce finish the sentence; bursting into tears, {{in spite of his}} efforts to suppress them, and with difficulty collected himself enough afterwards to add, [...] "I wish to be permitted to assure him that I did not act under this impression, but submitted to a necessity imposed upon me, as contrary to my own inclination as to his wishes." [...] His request was complied with, and he wrote a letter to Sir Henry Clinton to the above purport. He made mention also of his mother and three sisters, to whom the value of his commission would be an object. [...] "It is needless," [...] said he, [...] "to be more explicit on this subject; I am persuaded of your Excellency's goodness." ...|$|E

500|$|<b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{preparing}} for a potential candidacy for U.S. President since at least early 2003.

50|$|From 1824 to 1826, he was Bucktails {{member of}} the New York State Senate where he {{introduced}} on April 12, 1824, the motion to remove Ex-Governor DeWitt Clinton from the Erie Canal Commission. <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{the driving force behind}} the Erie Canal construction, but was hated by the Bucktails. The maneuver backfired, since the indignation caused by this ungrateful political move led to Clinton's re-election as Governor of New York in November of the same year.|$|R

50|$|Hillary Clinton won {{the primary}} by 9.28 {{percentage}} points, a wider margin than expected than recent polls suggested, but smaller than most January and February polls.

Likewise, his two Hawaiian-American passenger liners were to fail due to stiff competition from the Matson Navigation Company. The global oversupply of shipping was becoming increasingly evident.|$|R
50|$|In {{politics}} Murray was {{a friend}} of the Democratic-Republicans of the Albany Regency. Their leading character, De Witt <b>Clinton,</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> involved in scandal.

Murray's role was to act as bodyguard and protector of the V-P. Then one day on the Chesapeake half of President Tyler's cabinet was blown sky high. Murray's political ambitions ended there and then.|$|R
