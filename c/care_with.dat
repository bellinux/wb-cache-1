5|$|Analyzing the results, The Burlington Free Press {{pointed to}} Shumlin's {{relatively}} soft numbers in opinion polls – {{he was in}} the mid-40s in the last four polls of the race – as evidence that voters were dissatisfied with the progress the state had made in instituting single-payer health <b>care,</b> <b>with</b> rising property taxes, and with the unsuccessful roll-out of Vermont Health Connect, the state's federal health care exchange. Shumlin's internal polls showed a close race and he touted an endorsement from U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy to try to put him over 50%. By comparison, Milne lagged in fundraising and spending, with $100,000 available compared to Shumlin's $1.1 million, which meant that he could not afford to pay for polling.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's {{publications}} {{were rarely}} luxury goods: he priced his merchandise competitively, but always within {{the reach of}} the middle class, the audience he most wanted to serve. One way that he reduced costs was by printing texts in the provinces and then importing them to London; many of Priestley's works, for example, were printed locally in Birmingham. Johnson did not take great <b>care</b> <b>with</b> the printing of many of his books; they are full of errors and poorly bound. But as they were often printed extremely quickly to respond to a particular event, this was expected by his contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts {{have adopted}} a range of {{reproductive}} strategies. Most use external fertilisation: the female lays a batch of eggs, the male fertilises them and the larvae develop without any further parental involvement. A fair proportion of teleosts are sequential hermaphrodites, starting life as females and transitioning to males at some stage, with a few species reversing this process. A small percentage of teleosts are viviparous and some provide parental <b>care</b> <b>with</b> typically the male fish guarding a nest and fanning the eggs to keep them well-oxygenated.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study elderly people’s {{experiences}} of and approach to their usage of home <b>care</b> services <b>with</b> tax deduction. The aim was also to describe how elderly people reason about their underlying motives of using home <b>care</b> service <b>with</b> tax deduction. The study is based on six qualitative interviews with people {{between the ages of}} 65 and 80, living in Nacka, Sweden. This thesis is a collaboration with Stiftelsen Stockholms läns Äldrecentrum/ Stockholm Gerontology Center and part of their follow up study concerning simplified administration for elderly people applying for home care services in Nacka. The theory of rational choice was used in the analysis of the results. The primary results showed that elderly people’s usage of home <b>care</b> services <b>with</b> tax deduction was limited though regular and consist mainly of basic domestic work. The overall experiences of using home <b>care</b> services <b>with</b> tax deduction were positive and described in terms of satisfaction and as a possibility of independence and influence regarding their needs of services and how they were executed. The results indicate that the usage of home <b>care</b> services <b>with</b> tax deduction is partly based on elderly people’s lack of confidence in publicly-financed elderly care. Due to the distrust in elderly care and the self-determing factors home <b>care</b> services <b>with</b> tax deduction generated, their choice of using home <b>care</b> services <b>with</b> tax deduction seemed more appealing than publicly-financed home care services. ...|$|R
5|$|A {{vignette}} in the two-part series Divided We Stand {{explored the}} after-effects of Anole's numerous traumatic experiences at the Xavier Institute during {{his return to}} his hometown. Northstar, now rehabilitated, is contacted by Cyclops to find Anole, who goes into hiding after accidentally attacking his own father due to posttraumatic stress disorder from his experiences at the Xavier Institute. Northstar discovers Anole at his tree house, unhappy to see his former mentor. At first, Northstar makes jokes, thinking Anole is having a problem with fitting in as both a mutant and as a gay teen. Anole explains that his town accepts him for {{who he is and}} that his problems come from Northstar, along with the other X-Men, for providing the students under their <b>care</b> <b>with</b> a poor education, stealing their innocence by constantly exposing them to danger, and then throwing them away by disbanding. Planning to run away, Anole leaves a note for his parents at the tree house and elbows Northstar in the face—similar to how Northstar attacked him in the past—and tells him to tell all of the former New X-Men not to come looking for him.|$|E

He told the court that his parents {{suggested}} to Sheila that evening that the boys be placed in day-time foster <b>care</b> <b>with</b> a local family. Bamber said Sheila did not seem bothered by the suggestion and had simply said she would rather stay in London. The boys had been in foster care before, although in London rather than near White House Farm, and it had not appeared to cause a problem for Sheila. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Ferguson, told the Court of Appeal in 2002 that any suggestion that the children be removed from her care would have provoked a strong reaction from Sheila, but that she might have welcomed daytime help.|$|E
5|$|The cost of {{hospice care}} may {{be met by}} health {{insurance}} providers, including Medicare or Medicaid for eligible Americans. Hospice is covered 100% with no co-pay or deductible by Medicare Part A except that patients are responsible for a copay for outpatient drugs and respite care, if needed. (Respite care may be necessary, for instance, if a family member who is providing home hospice care is briefly unable to perform his or her duties and an alternative care provider becomes necessary.) As of 2008, Medicare was responsible for around 80% of hospice payments, reimbursing providers differently from county to county with a higher rate for inpatient hospice care. A lower rate is paid for home <b>care,</b> <b>with</b> a higher rate paid for round-the-clock nursing care {{in order to get}} a patient's symptoms under control.|$|E

40|$|This was a {{cross-sectional}} study investigating {{factors related to}} satisfaction <b>with</b> <b>care</b> among long-term mentally ill patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, selected from an outpatient register. Demographic factors, personality variables, and health-related factors were related to their satisfaction <b>with</b> <b>care.</b> Satisfaction <b>with</b> <b>care</b> showed no relationships to demographic factors such as age, living conditions, or civil status. However, significant associations indicated that patients {{who had never been}} hospitalized for mental illness, who were native Swedes, or who had an independent living rated their satisfaction <b>with</b> <b>care</b> higher. Personality, measured with the Temperament and Character Inventory, showed a relationship to satisfaction <b>with</b> <b>care</b> on only one dimension, self-directedness, of seven. Some of the results indicated a relationship between subjective measures and satisfaction <b>with</b> <b>care,</b> and some did not, but, taken together, the findings suggested a partial influence from a subjective factor on both subjective measures of well-being and on satisfaction <b>with</b> <b>care.</b> However, associations between interviewer-rated measures of health-related variables and satisfaction <b>with</b> <b>care</b> proposed that the better-functioning patients were more satisfied <b>with</b> the <b>care,</b> in turn indicating that the services better suited these patients. Thus, assuming that the influence of treatment was controlled for through the selection of long-term mentally ill subjects, this study pointed to two determinants of satisfaction with care: a selectively working subjective factor and the services being better designed for the better-functioning patients...|$|R

5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{cultural}} factors that reinforce this practice. These include the child's financial future, her dowry, social ties and social status, prevention of premarital sex, extramarital pregnancy and STIs. The arguments against it include interruption of education and loss of employment prospects, and hence economic status, as well as loss of normal childhood and its emotional maturation and social isolation. Child marriage places the girl in a relationship where she is in a major imbalance of power and perpetuates the gender inequality that contributed to the practice in the first place. Also in the case of minors, there are the issues of human rights, non-consensual sexual activity and forced marriage and a 2016 joint report of the WHO and Inter-Parliamentary Union places the two concepts together as Child, Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM), as did the 2014 Girl Summit (see below). In addition the likely pregnancies at a young age are associated with higher medical risks for both mother and child, multiple pregnancies and less access to <b>care</b> <b>with</b> pregnancy being amongst the leading causes of death amongst girls aged 15–19. Girls married under age {{are also more likely to}} be the victims of domestic violence.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{special schools}} in Singapore, which place little {{emphasis}} on academics, Pathlight School {{uses the same}} academic curriculum as mainstream primary and secondary schools. The sole exception is that mother tongue lessons are replaced with classes covering social and life skills. The school accommodates {{the needs of students}} with smaller class sizes, staff trained to handle autistic children, more visual teaching methods, more predictable environments and individual education plans for each student. Satellite classes and special events give students regular opportunities to interact with neurotypical (non-autistic) peers from mainstream schools; exceptional students are allowed to attend classes with mainstream students for some subjects. To prepare students for employment, Pathlight School runs computing courses, a design studio and a cafe staffed by students. The school also produces book compilations of thoughts written by students, conducts exhibitions of student artwork and sells merchandise made by students, to help students develop useful skills, raise funds for the school and raise awareness of autism. In addition, Pathlight School has hosted autism events such as the WeCAN Learning Congress 2010, where over 20 international experts shared their best practices in autism <b>care</b> <b>with</b> about 560 delegates.|$|E

40|$|Background Patient-centered medical homes (PCMHs) {{may improve}} {{outcomes}} for non-elderly adults with mental illness, but {{the extent to}} which PCMHs are associated <b>with</b> preventive <b>care</b> and healthcare quality for this population is largely unknown. Our study addresses this gap by assessing the associations between receipt of <b>care</b> consistent <b>with</b> the PCMH and preventive care and healthcare quality for non-elderly adults with mental illness. Methods This surveillance study used self-reported data for 6, 908 non-elderly adults with mental illness participating in the 2007 – 2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Preventive care and healthcare quality measures included: participant rating of all healthcare; cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer screening; current smoking; smoking cessation advice; flu shot; foot exam and eye exam for people with diabetes; and follow-up after emergency room visit for mental illness. Multiple logistic regression models were developed to compare the odds of meeting preventive care and healthcare quality measures for participants without a usual source of <b>care,</b> participants <b>with</b> a non-PCMH usual source of care, and participants who received <b>care</b> consistent <b>with</b> the PCMH. Results Compared to participants without a usual source of <b>care,</b> those <b>with</b> a non-PCMH usual source of care had better odds of meeting almost all measures examined, while those who received <b>care</b> consistent <b>with</b> the PCMH had better odds of meeting most measures. Participants who received <b>care</b> consistent <b>with</b> the PCMH had better odds of meeting only one measure compared to participants with a non-PCMH usual source of <b>care.</b> Conclusions Compared <b>with</b> having a non-PCMH usual source of care, receipt of <b>care</b> consistent <b>with</b> the PCMH {{does not appear to be}} associated <b>with</b> most preventive <b>care</b> or healthcare quality measures. These findings raise concerns about the potential value of the PCMH for non-elderly adults with mental illness and suggest that alternative models of primary care are needed to improve outcomes and address disparities for this population...|$|R
