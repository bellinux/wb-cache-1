40|$|Coal {{has been}} an energy source for {{hundreds}} of years in the United States. It helped provide many basic needs, from energy for domestic heating and cooking, to transportation for people, products, and raw materials, to energy for industrial applications and electricity generation. America’s economic progress historically is linked to the use of coal from its abundant coal resources. MILESTONES IN U. <b>S.</b> <b>COAL</b> PRODUCTION Coal production in the United States grew steadily from the colonial period, fed the Industrial Revolution, and supplied industrial and transportation fuel during the two World Wars (Figure 1). Around 1950, coal consumption was distributed among the consuming sectors- industrial, residential and commercial, metallurgical coke ovens, electric power, and transportation- with each sector accounting for 5 to 25 percent of total consumption. From the end of World War II to 1960, coal use for rail and water transportation and for space heating declined. Coal demand grew, however, with the post-War growth in American industry and increased electricity generation starting in the early 1960 ’s. In 1950, U. <b>S.</b> <b>coal</b> production was 560 million short tons (MMst). In 2003, U. <b>S.</b> <b>coal</b> productio...|$|R

40|$|EPA {{estimates}} 1997 U. S. methane {{emissions from}} coal mines at 18. 8 MMTCE (3. 3 Tg), accounting for 10 {{percent of total}} U. S. anthropogenic methane emissions (see Exhibit 4 - 1). Methane, formed during coalification, is stored in coal seams and the surrounding strata and released during coal mining. Small amounts of methane are also released during the processing, transport, and storage of coal. Deeper coal seams contain much larger amounts of methane than shallow seams. Accordingly, 65 percent of 1997 U. <b>S.</b> <b>coal</b> mine methane emissions were from underground mines, even though underground mines accounted for only 39 percent of coal production. EPA expects methane emissions from U. <b>S.</b> <b>coal</b> mines to increase faster than total U. <b>S.</b> <b>coal</b> production because underground coal production – mined at increasingly greater depths – is projected to grow faster than surface production. EPA estimates that methane emissions from coal mines will reach 28. 0 MMTCE (4. 9 Tg) by 2010, excluding possible Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP) reductions. Methane emissions from coal mines can be reduced by methane recovery and use projects at underground mines and by the oxidation of methane in ventilation air using new technologies. In 1997, 14 underground U. <b>S.</b> <b>coal</b> mines recovered and used methane, achieving annual reductions of 4. 6 MMTCE (0. 8 Tg).

40|$|This project {{proposes to}} develop and test schemes for the direct {{utilization}} of western U. <b>S.</b> <b>coals</b> in advanced power systems. One of the major issues facing such utilization of coal is the arrival of vapor-phase ash constituents that can cause fouling and hot corrosion of gas path components. The utilization schemes being developed and tested rely {{on the fact that}} western U. <b>S.</b> <b>coals</b> can be ''partially'' gasified at relatively low temperatures, and that the concomitant char produced is reactive. These characteristics afford western U. <b>S.</b> <b>coals</b> a significant advantage over bituminous coals and solid waste fuels such as petroleum coke. As part of this project, over the past four years, WRI has constructed and tested a fuel-flexible gasifier. The four-inch diameter, fluidized-bed gasifier was designed to be operated as an air-blown, enriched air-blown, oxygen-blown, or as a steam pyrolysis unit. During the past year, the fluidized-bed gasification unit was modified for oxygen-blown operation. Specifically, steam and oxygen delivery systems were installed to allow steam/O{sub 2 } mixtures to be used in place of air, and gasification tests were performed with steam/O{sub 2 } as the fluidizing medium. The primary goal was to characterize the synthesis gas and char products for oxygen-blown conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of XAFS spectroscopy is described for {{the determination of}} the speciation of sulfur and various hazardous or key metals in both coarse (> 2. 5 μm) and fine (> 2. 5 μｍ) fractions of particulate matter (PM) emitted in three different fossil-fuel combustion processes. The three processes consisted of (i) combustion of residual oil, (ii) combustion of various eastern and western U. <b>S.</b> <b>coals,</b> and (iii) combustion of diesel fuel formulations in an engine. Sulfur was found to exist in mainly sulfate forms in the emissions from all three processes, although minor to significant fractions of the sulfur were also present as thiophenic sulfur, elemental sulfur, and various other sulfur forms, depending on the fossil fuel, the combustion conditions, and the particle size of the collected fraction. Combustion of residual oil tended to form metal sulfates predominantly, although the coarse fractions (PM 2. 5 +) also contained minor amounts of sulfides of Fe, Cu and Ni, while the fine fractions (PM 2. 5) contained oxides instead of sulfides as their minor components. Due to the presence of aluminosilicates in the coal, metal species in coal emissions were more complex. Chromium was present entirely as Cr 3 + in both fine and coarse PM from combustion of eastern U. <b>S.</b> <b>coals,</b> but significant fractions of the chromium were present as more toxic and carcinogenic Cr(Vl) species in fine and coarse PM from combustion of western U. <b>S.</b> <b>coals.</b> In contrast, arsenic was present entirely as arsenate (AsO 43 -) species in all coal PM samples (and residual oil PM samples), regardless of origin. No evidence was found for the more toxic As (Ⅲ) oxidation state in any sample. The zinc speciation in PM samples from combustion of coal samples was also found to vary with geographic origin of the coal. Zinc in PM samples from eastern U. <b>S.</b> <b>coals</b> was present mostly as Zn ferrite (ZnFe 2 O 4), while the Zn speciation in PM from western U. <b>S.</b> <b>coals</b> was more complex. The XANES signatures of Zn in PM from both residual oil and diesel combustion processes were quite different from those of PM from coal combustion and suggestive of anhydrous zinc sulfate. 　　　　Comparison was also made of sulfur and zinc XANES spectra for PM collected on filters from the ambient atmosphere with those from the fossil fuel combustion processes.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to demonstrate and evaluate commercially available Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) catalysts from U. S., Japanese and European catalyst suppliers on a high-sulfur U. S. coal-fired boiler. SCR is a post-combustion nitrogen oxide (NO.) control technology that involves injecting ammonia into the flue gas generated from coal combustion in an electric utility boiler. The flue gas containing ammonia is then passed through a reactor that contains a specialized catalyst. In {{the presence of the}} catalyst, the ammonia reacts with NO. to convert it to nitrogen and water vapor. Although SCR is widely practiced in Japan and Europe on gas-, oil-, and low-sulfur coal- fired boilers, there are several technical uncertainties associated with applying SCR to U. <b>S.</b> <b>coals.</b> These uncertainties include: 1) potential catalyst deactivation due to poisoning by trace metal species present in U. <b>S.</b> <b>coals</b> that are not present in other fuels. 2) performance of the technology and effects on the balance-of- plant equipment in the presence of high amounts of SO{sub 2 } and SO{sub 3 }. 3) performance {{of a wide variety of}} SCR catalyst compositions, geometries and methods of manufacturer under typical high-sulfur coal-fired utility operating conditions.
