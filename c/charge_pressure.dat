This is important for maximum <b>charge</b> <b>pressure</b> (volumetric efficiency) and fuel economy. It is used on most high-performance engine designs.|$|E
50|$|To {{compensate}} for the increased air resistance in the intake, engines fitted with Heat Plates have a slightly adjusted <b>charge</b> <b>pressure,</b> Approximately: +0.2 bar, this means that LPT models with heat plates have a solenoid valve to raise the charging pressure above basic charging pressure.|$|E
50|$|Basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> is {{fundamental}} for Automatic Performance Control (APC). Basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> is mechanically adjusted on the actuators pushrod between the actuator and the waste gate. At to low basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> the engine doesn’t revs up as expected when the throttle is opened quickly. At to high basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> a negative adaptation occurs and maximum <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> cannot be achieved. In addition {{there is a}} substantial risk of engine damage since the <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> can’t be lowered enough when regulating with attention to pre ignition/pinging. Basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> shall be 0,40 ±0,03 bar (5,80 ±0,43 PSI). After adjustment the push rod must have at least two turns (2 mm) pre tension when connecting to the waste gate lever. The purpose with that {{is to make sure that}} the waste gate is held close when not affected. On new turbo chargers the basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> tends to be near or spot on the upper tolerance when the pre tension is two turns. The pre tension may never be lesser than two turns (2 mm). When checking the basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> it shall be noted that the pressure decreases at high RPM and increases at low outside temperatures.|$|R
40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} {{that show that}} the refrigeration efficiency of GM refrigerators can be improved by applying a <b>charged</b> <b>pressure.</b> Recently, there has been remarkable progress in superconducting systems, such as magnetic resonance imaging systems, silicon singlecrystal pull-up apparatus, and cryopumps. GM cryocoolers are used to cool these systems because of their high reliability. Thus, to improve the efficiency of superconducting systems, {{it is important to}} improve the efficiency of GM cryocoolers. If the compression ratio of a GM cryocooler is reduced, its coefficient of performance (COP) will approach the Carnot COP, since the cryocooler will operate with Simon expansion. Therefore, we investigated the effect of varying the <b>charged</b> <b>pressure</b> of a cryocooler and the cycle frequency on its refrigeration efficiency. We developed a GM cryocooler that can be operated at various <b>charged</b> <b>pressures</b> and we measured its efficiency at various <b>charged</b> <b>pressures</b> and operating frequencies. The optimum <b>charged</b> <b>pressure</b> and operating frequency were determined by comparing the experimental results with numerical simulation results...|$|R

The engine was {{unique in that}} it used asymmetrical turbocharging; with the turbocharger driven by the exhaust gases from only one bank of cylinders. A <b>charge</b> <b>pressure</b> of 3.6 PSI (0.25 bar) was produced using a Garrett GT15 turbo.

50|$|When the {{required}} <b>charge</b> <b>pressure</b> has finally been calculated it {{is converted to}} the PWM signal that controls the solenoid valve, The ECU then controls that the actual pressure (measured by the pressure sensor) corresponds with {{the required}} pressure. If needed the PWM is fine tuned by multiplication of a correction factor. The correction factor (adaptation) is then stored {{in the memory of}} the ECU and is always used in the calculation of the PWM signal. The rationale with this {{is to make sure that}} the actual pressure as soon as possible will be equal to the required after a change of the load has occurred.|$|E
50|$|Although general {{relativity}} {{can be used}} to perform a semi-classical calculation of black hole entropy, this situation is theoretically unsatisfying. In statistical mechanics, entropy is understood as counting the number of microscopic configurations of a system that have the same macroscopic qualities (such as mass, <b>charge,</b> <b>pressure,</b> etc.). Without a satisfactory theory of quantum gravity, one cannot perform such a computation for black holes. Some {{progress has been made in}} various approaches to quantum gravity. In 1995, Andrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa showed that counting the microstates of a specific supersymmetric black hole in string theory reproduced the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Since then, similar results have been reported for different black holes both in string theory and in other approaches to quantum gravity like loop quantum gravity.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Charging</b> <b>pressure</b> {{regulation}} utilises a two coiled three way {{solenoid valve}} pneumatically connected with hoses to the turbo charger’s waste gate, the turbo chargers outlet and the compressor’s inlet. The solenoid valve is electrically supplied from +54 via fuse 13 and {{is controlled by}} the ECU via its pin 26 and pin 2. The control voltage is pulse width modulated (PWM) at 90 Hz below 2500 RPM and 70 Hz above 2500 RPM. The rationale for this change is to avoid resonance phenomena in the pneumatic hoses. By grounding pin2 longer than pin 26 the <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> is decreased and vice verse, when pin 26 is grounded longer than pin 2 the <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> is increased. To be able to regulate the <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> the ECU must at first calculate a requested pressure, a pressure value that the system must strive for. This is done by taking a pre programmed value (matrix of values established in respect of RPM and throttle opening). At WOT the pressure values for each RPM are selected {{to make sure that the}} engine gets the requested torque.|$|R

5000|$|What set the 900 Turbo {{apart from}} its turbo-equipped competitors, {{especially}} in the early- and mid-1980s, was the {{development and use of}} the Automatic Performance Control (APC) boost controller from 1982.

40|$|International audienceThe present work {{deals with}} the {{measurement}} and performance of a gamma Stirling engine of 500 ?W of mechanical shaft power and 600 ?rpm of maximal revolutions per minute. Series of measurements concerning the pressure distribution, temperature evolution, and brake power were performed. The study of the different functioning parameters such as initial <b>charge</b> <b>pressure,</b> engine velocity, cooling water flowrate, and temperature gradient (between the sources of heat) has been analyzed. The engine brake power increases with the initial <b>charge</b> <b>pressure,</b> with the cooling water flow, and with the engine revolutions per minute. The working fluid temperature measurements have been recorded in different locations symmetrically along both regenerator sides. The recorded temperature in regenerator side one is about 252 degrees C and about 174 degrees C in the opposite side (side two). It shows an asymmetric temperature distribution in the Stirling engine regenerator; consequently, heat transfer inside this porous medium is deteriorated.

To be able to operate such an engine at relevant conditions comparable to a multi cylinder engine, it is desirable to model and control the boundary conditions, e. g. trough simulation of turbo charging. This work was done as a master thesis during the spring of 2012 at Chalmers University of Technology and the aim was to develop an online simulation of a single turbo system for a single cylinder combustion research engine. The simulation was developed in Matlab/Simulink and integrated in an AVL PUMA test bed system using AVL ARTE. Lab. The turbo performance was predicted by using measured data from the turbo developer, measured according to SAE standard.

50|$|During engine {{operations}} the Ignition cassette continuously {{monitors the}} ion currents in the cylinders and sends {{a signal to}} the Trionic ECU, pin 44, in an event of knocking. The logic for this function rests solely in the ignition cassette and is adaptive {{to be able to handle}} disturbing fuel additives. The Trionic ECU is well aware which cylinder that has ignited and could hence cope with the information feed through one pin. The signal to pin 44 and ion current in the combustion chamber is related to each other, when this signal reaches a certain level the ECU interprets this as a knocking event and firstly lowering the ignition advance by 1,5° on this cylinder. If the knocking is repeated the ignition advance is lowered further 1,5 ° up to 12°. In case of the same lowering of the ignition timing advance in all cylinders the ECU adds a small amount of fuel to all cylinders. If knocking occurs when the MAP is over 140 kPa the knocking is regulated by switching both fuel injection matrix and ignition advance matrix. If this is not sufficient the <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> is lowered. This purpose of this procedure is to maintain good performance.
