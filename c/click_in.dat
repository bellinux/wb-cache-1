The mini-map shows {{a summary of the}} whole territory, with green dots for the player's {{buildings}} and units and red dots for enemy ones. The player can <b>click</b> <b>in</b> the main map or the minimap to scroll the main map around the territory.|$|E
25|$|Once {{one or more}} {{units have}} been {{selected}}, the player can click {{on the ground to}} make them walk to the selected spot, or click on an enemy to make them attack. Units with projectile weapons, such as archers and dwarves can also be ordered to attack a specific spot on the ground, rather than an enemy. It is also important that the player have their units facing in the right direction. This is accomplished by pressing the left or the right arrow key or moving the mouse to rotate the direction of the units as they move to the selected location. Facing the correct direction is especially important when using formations, of which there are nine available. After selecting a group of units, the player must press the corresponding formation button on the keyboard, and then click on the ground where they want the units to form. The player can also order all selected units to scatter and to retreat. All formations, as well as commands such as stopping, guarding, scattering, retreating, and reversing direction, are also available via a single <b>click</b> <b>in</b> the Control Bar {{at the bottom of the}} screen.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{described}} live concerts by the Amps as unpolished and relaxed. The Chronicles Drema Crist praised {{their show}} at an unidentified location as [...] "fun-spirited and silly". Greg Kot of The Chicago Tribune described {{one of their}} Chicago performances as [...] "off-kilter" [...] and wrote that [...] "Deal's pungent vocals were {{swallowed up by the}} guitars, and the foursome's slight melodies were lost amid all the bashing." [...] A review in The Chicago Reader of the same concert noted that [...] "The Amps play with a low-key, hangout sound." [...] The Phoenixs Matt Ashare felt that at their December 1995 show in Boston [...] "the Amps didn't <b>click</b> <b>in</b> a way that would suggest that this was Deal's new, full-time band"; he added that it was [...] "an unpretentiously gritty way for Deal to let off some steam while the Breeders [...] a little break". In Boston Rock, this concert was characterized as [...] "sloppy" [...] but [...] "charm ... hanging loosely off Kim's gruff vocals and ebullient personality".|$|E

50|$|Initially and in {{citation}} form, {{the nasal}} component may be inaudible. That is, {{in this position}} glottalized clicks differ from plain (tenuis) <b>clicks</b> <b>in</b> the gap between click and vowel (the voice onset time), and from aspirated <b>clicks</b> <b>in</b> that this gap is silent rather than noisy. In canonical form, a glottal stop occurs between {{the release of the}} click and the start of the following vowel. However, in practice the glottalization often 'leaks', with a creaky-voiced transition into the vowel. However, in medial position or embedded in a phrase after a vowel the nasalization can usually be heard: any preceding vowel will be nasalized or the click will be prenasalized. This is somewhat similar to aspirated nasal <b>clicks,</b> though <b>in</b> the later case the nasal airflow continues through the <b>click</b> itself. <b>In</b> neither case is the following vowel normally nasalized, something which occurs with simple nasal <b>clicks</b> <b>in</b> languages like Gǀui.|$|R

In the fall and winter of 2000, Seacrest was the host of The NBC Saturday Night Movie. During commercial breaks, he offered trivia on the film and a chance to win prizes by answering online on NBCi. In 2001, he hosted a reality television program, Ultimate Revenge, where elaborate practical jokes were played on family and friends instigated by their own relatives and friends. It was shown on TNN (now Spike) from 2001 to 2003.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the third}} week of the season, Michigan hosted Pittsburgh. Michigan {{dominated}} the game, winning by a 69-0 score and outgaining the Panthers 496 yards to 69. One week earlier, Notre Dame had beaten Pitt by a score of 40-6. Pitt converted only one first down in the entire game. After the first quarter in Ann Arbor, the score was 0-0. Michigan's offense began to <b>click</b> <b>in</b> the second quarter with three touchdowns, followed by three more in the third quarter and four in the fourth quarter. The game's highlights included a 70-yard touchdown pass from Bob Chappuis to Bob Mann, a 40-yard interception return by Bump Elliott, an 80-yard punt return by Gene Derricotte. Michigan's ten touchdowns were scored by Mann (2), Derricotte, Jack Weisenburger, Bump Elliott, Don Kuick, Tom Peterson, and Len Ford. Jim Brieske converted 9 of 10 PAT attempts.

2500|$|The {{address bar}} has been {{modified}} {{to present a}} breadcrumbs view, which shows the full path to the current location. Clicking any location in the path hierarchy takes the user to that level, instead of repeatedly pressing the Back button or pressing the up button. This is roughly analogous to what is possible prior to Windows Vista by pressing the small down-arrow next to [...] "Back" [...] and selecting any folder {{from a list of}} previously accessed folders. It makes the [...] "Up One Level" [...] button obsolete so that is removed. It is also possible to navigate to any subfolder of the current folder using the arrow {{to the right of the}} last item, or to <b>click</b> <b>in</b> the space to the right of this to copy or edit the path manually. As with many other Microsoft-made Windows Vista applications, the menu bar is hidden by default. Pressing the Alt key makes the menu bar appear. Free and used space on all drives is shown in horizontal indicator bars. Check boxes allow the selection of multiple files. When items are grouped, clicking the group header selects all items under that group. Multiple groups of files can also be selected by clicking the group headers while holding down Ctrl.|$|E
2500|$|The Bill is modelled, {{more or less}} directly, on the {{proposals}} put forward by the European Commission for a draft Temporary and Agency Worker Directive (...) [...] This proposal was itself shelved, because of the UK government's consistent opposition to agency regulation, {{in the interests of}} labour market flexibility. According to newspaper reports, the UK got the backing of Germany to torpedo the draft Directive in return for the UK to help sink the Takeover Directive (Germany has comprehensive agency work regulation under its [...] and its Civil Code, esp §622, and the UK has strong Takeover Regulation, especially Rule 21 of the City Code). The significant difference between the proposed Directive and the Bill is that the former UK government managed to insert a 6 week qualification period in the Directive before the equal treatment rights <b>click</b> <b>in</b> (Art. 5(4)). The Bill has no proposed qualification period, though voices in the City have been calling for this to be one year. The latest reports suggest a 12 week qualifying period has been agreed between the private MP backers and the government, meaning a significant step back from the protection the Directive would offer. The Directive included equal treatment only for pay, hours, parental rights and anti-discrimination (Art. 3(1)(d)). A significant omission therefore was any regulation on reasonable notice before dismissal (in the UK, ERA s.86).|$|E
