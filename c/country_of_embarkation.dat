40|$|Finding an ancestor’s birthplace or {{residence}} {{within his}} or her native country may cause anxiety among family historians and genealogists because passenger lists record country of origin while usually ignoring the village, town, or region where emigrants were born or resided prior to emigrating. This information determines where a researcher must look for records to verify birth, christening, marriage, or other events, and to locate ancestors and contemporary relatives. In addition, the country recorded on the passenger lists or arrival records, in the destination country, is often the emigrant’s <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation,</b> not the birth country. Emigrants often spent time living in an alien European country before departing for their final destinations. To find the record-keeping locality, the family historian needs to consult records created and archived within the country and region of origin that give the birthplace and residence of the emigrant. Passport applications and passports record this information with other personal information about the emigrant, such as physical description, occupation, traveling companions, and character, solvency, or military status. ...|$|E
40|$|This article takes Italy’s widely-debated 2009 push-backs to Libya {{campaign}} {{as a point}} of reference to address whether bilateral agreements for technical and police cooperation provide the legal foundation for the forced return of intercepted refugees to <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation.</b> Through a detailed analysis of both the facts and the texts of the published and unpublished bilateral accords, it concludes that, although push-backs do not have a clear legal basis, the agreements between Italy and Libya constitute a fundamental component of the multifaceted legal and political framework underpinning Italy’s practice of interdiction and return. Moreover, by entrusting a non-EU third country with the authority and legal competence for the maritime operations, bilateral agreements for migration control may distance the responsibility (for international wrongful acts) of the outsourcing state. Migrants and refugees are autonomously intercepted by the third country in international waters, or in its coastal waters, before their arrival at the EU’s gateways. By venturing into the labyrinth of state responsibility in general international law, this article considers Italy’s possible liability for ‘aiding and assisting’ Libya, in a variety of ways, in the unlawful containment of irregular migration by sea and the resulting refoulement of intercepted refugees...|$|R
25|$|Two ports <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> were {{established}} with commanders appointed 17 July 1917, one at New York with headquarters at Hoboken and the second, then officially the Newport News Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation,</b> in Hampton Roads with headquarters at Newport News. While 88% of troops, 1,656,000 from New York itself and 142,000 from its sub-ports, sent overseas transited through the New York Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation,</b> 288,000 transited through the Newport News Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation.</b>|$|R
25|$|Hampton Roads Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> (HRPOE or HRPE) was {{the third}} largest United States Army Transportation Corps port <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> in terms <b>of</b> {{passengers}} and second in terms of cargo tonnage on the East Coast of the United States during World War II. Until June 1942 Hampton Roads was a sub-port of the New York Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation.</b>|$|R
50|$|The New York Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> {{continued}} operations {{under the}} Chief of Transportation with the Hampton Roads Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> becoming a sub-port effective 31 March 1954. On 28 September 1955 the New York Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> was redesignated effective 1 October as the Atlantic Transportation Terminal Command, Brooklyn, headquartered in the Brooklyn Army Base {{with responsibility for}} operation of all Army terminal and related activities of the Atlantic coast from those in Canada south to Miami, Florida. By the same order the other Ports <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> and sub-ports were redesignated. The Brooklyn Army Base, a class III sub-installation of the New York Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> was separated and designated the Brooklyn Army Terminal. Effective 1 April 1965 the remaining Army facility of the NYPOE, the Brooklyn Army Terminal, along with other such remnant facilities of the old ports <b>of</b> <b>embarkation,</b> were transferred from the Army Material Command to the Military Traffic Management and Terminal Service.|$|R
50|$|In World War II the NYPOE, {{now under}} the new Transportation Corps, was the largest of eight Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> commands, the second largest being the San Francisco Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> and the second largest on the East Coast being Hampton Roads Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation.</b> Originally it had the army {{facilities}} in Charleston, South Carolina as a sub-port until it was elevated to the Charleston Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> as a separate command. The cargo sub-port at Philadelphia remained {{under the command of}} NYPOE throughout the war. By {{the end of the war}} 3,172,778 passengers, counting 475 embarked at the Philadelphia cargo port, and 37,799,955 measurement tons of cargo had passed through the New York port itself with 5,893,199 tons of cargo having passed through its cargo sub-port at Philadelphia—about 44% of all troops and 34% of all cargo passing through army ports <b>of</b> <b>embarkation.</b>|$|R
50|$|The New York Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> (NYPOE) was a United States Army command {{responsible}} for the movement of troops and supplies from the United States to overseas commands. The command had facilities in New York, New Jersey, roughly covering the extent of today's Port of New York and New Jersey, as well as ports in other cities as sub-ports under its direct command. During World War I, when it was originally known as the Hoboken Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> with headquarters in seized Hamburg America Line facilities in Hoboken, New Jersey, the Quartermaster Corps had responsibility. The sub-ports were at Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia and the Canadian ports of Halifax, Montreal and St. Johns. The World War I port <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> was disestablished, seized and requisitioned facilities returned or sold and operations consolidated at the new army terminal in Brooklyn. Between the wars reduced operations continued the core concepts of a port <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> and as the home port of Atlantic army ships. With war in Europe the army revived the formal New York Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> command with the New York port, the only Atlantic port <b>of</b> <b>embarkation,</b> taking a lead in developing concepts for operations.|$|R

It had been activated as the Newport News Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> in World War I, deactivated, then reactivated 15 June 1942.|$|R
