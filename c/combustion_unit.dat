5000|$|Caustic soda {{is limited}} to smaller <b>combustion</b> <b>units</b> {{because it is more}} {{expensive}} than lime, but it has the advantage that it forms a solution rather than a slurry. This makes it easier to operate. It produces a [...] "spent caustic" [...] solution of sodium sulfite/bisulfite (depending on the pH), or sodium sulfate that must be disposed of. This is not a problem in a kraft pulp mill for example, where this can be a source of makeup chemicals to the recovery cycle.|$|R
50|$|Even {{though only}} one turbine is used, the Allam cycle can {{potentially}} achieve efficiencies {{up to about}} 59 percent (LHV) for natural gas and 51-52 percent (LHV) for gasified coal. This {{is due to the}} use of carbon dioxide as the main constituent of the working fluid. In its supercritical state, which it reaches in the <b>combustion</b> <b>unit,</b> carbon dioxide is very efficient for driving a turbine. Also, energy losses from phase transitions of water are avoided, which allows Allam cycle plants to recover more energy in their heat exchangers than combined cycle plants can do. At this efficiency, carbon dioxide capture is already a part of the Allam cycle, whereas if desired in conventional plants, the capture has to be added as an external function that may decrease the overall efficiency by around 10 percent.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, the Allam cycle uses {{a single}} turbine, {{driven by a}} working fluid {{consisting}} of only water and carbon dioxide, {{the mass of the}} latter being around 97 percent of the total. This is achieved by using pure oxygen instead of air to burn the fuel. Similarly to combined-cycle plants, the intended fuel is natural gas or gasified coal. The exhaust gas is cooled in a heat exchanger, and the steam is condensed and separated from the flow, becoming a potential source of fresh water. The carbon dioxide is compressed mechanically, and a small amount, matching the amount continuously added through combustion, is captured at high pressure, ready for pipeline transmission. The rest of the carbon dioxide is reheated in the heat exchanger and recycled into the <b>combustion</b> <b>unit,</b> where it continues to form {{the vast majority of the}} working fluid.|$|E
50|$|Although not {{included}} in the tables below for each facility, another heavy metal pollutant emitted by coal-powered generators is lead (Pb). Lead is a powerful toxicant, negatively impacting human and animal health when ingested or inhaled, even in extremely small quantities. The newest generating unit at LG&E's Trimble County Station, TC2 (an 810 MW-gross coal <b>combustion</b> <b>unit</b> brought online in 2010) emits lead particulate matter at a rate of 499 kg/yr (approximately 1098 lb/yr, or to put into similar terms as used for human health, approximately 498 Billion micrograms). The current level set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for child lead blood levels requiring intervention is 5 micrograms per decileter of blood.By comparison, the TC2 unit emits mercury emissions at a rate of 1.3*10^-6 lb/MWH. Assuming operation of TC2 24 hours per day for 364 days per year, the TC2 annual emission of mercury is approximately 86 pounds.|$|E

40|$|Results from {{mathematical}} {{modeling of}} aerosol formation during combustion of woody biomass fuels {{were compared with}} results from particle size distribution (PSD) measurements at a pilot-scale biomass <b>combustion</b> <b>unit</b> with moving grate and flame tube boiler.
