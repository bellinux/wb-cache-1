5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{considered}} to be an incurable and rapidly lethal cancer unless both the primary tumor and any metastases can be fully removed by surgery. No potentially <b>curative</b> <b>treatment</b> exists except surgery, but most people have advanced stage disease at presentation and are inoperable at the time of diagnosis. People with cholangiocarcinoma are generally managed - though not cured - with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and other palliative care measures. These are also used as additional therapies after surgery in cases where resection has apparently been successful (or nearly so).|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} site of {{recurrence}} {{is in the}} vagina; vaginal relapses of endometrial cancer have the best prognosis. If relapse occurs from a cancer {{that has not been}} treated with radiation, EBRT is the first-line treatment and is often successful. If a cancer treated with radiation recurs, pelvic exenteration is the only option for <b>curative</b> <b>treatment.</b> Palliative chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery, and radiation are also performed. Radiation therapy (VBT and EBRT) for a local vaginal recurrence has a 50% five-year survival rate. Pelvic recurrences are treated with surgery and radiation, and abdominal recurrences are treated with radiation and, if possible, chemotherapy. Other common recurrence sites are the pelvic lymph nodes, para-aortic lymph nodes, peritoneum (28% of recurrences), and lungs, though recurrences can also occur in the brain (<1%), liver (7%), adrenal glands (1%), bones (4–7%; typically the axial skeleton), lymph nodes outside the abdomen (0.4–1%), spleen, and muscle/soft tissue (2–6%).|$|E

40|$|Background: End-of- life care poses {{fundamental}} {{ethical problems}} to clinicians. Development {{of new technology}} within medical and science {{have made it possible}} to keep patients alive with life-sustaining medical treatments such as elective intubation, mechanical ventilation, dialysis, artificial nutrition and hydration. The questions related to ethical decisions of withholding or withdrawing <b>curative</b> <b>treatments</b> have received substantial attention in medical journal as well as in public debate. Euthanasia is usually divided into active euthanasia and withholding/withdrawing <b>curative</b> <b>treatments</b> (previous known as passive euthanasia). Active euthanasia and assisted suicide are by the law illegal in Norway, this should be separated from withholding/withdrawing <b>curative</b> <b>treatments.</b> Withholding/withdrawing treatments are common and legal in Norway. The decision however serves difficult ethical problems, especially when the patients are in coma. Aims and objectives: The aim {{of this article is to}} discuss withholding/withdrawing <b>curative</b> <b>treatments</b> related to Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism. Methods: Extent literature review of articles written by religious leaders, doctors and medical ethics committees. Other data sources include books and different webpages to provide different perspectives regarding withholding/withdrawing <b>curative</b> <b>treatments.</b> Result: Defining euthanasia is a difficult and complex task, which causes confusion among health care-workers. Withholding/withdrawing <b>curative</b> <b>treatments</b> covers different actions such as “do not resuscitate” known as DNR, do not start lifesaving treatments- and withholding or withdrawing treatments in terminal ill patients. Thus the patient will die from the disease itself and not by the actions performed by clinicians (3). Dying from such actions is known as active euthanasia. Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism are all against active euthanasia and assisted suicide. The religions permit withholding/withdrawing treatments to various degrees. The Roman Catholic Church allows passive euthanasia which includes the use of pain relief and withdrawing treatments, but the previous pope, John Paul II, argued strongly against the actions of withdrawing artificial hydration and nutrition of incurable patients. Islam has a divided view of withholding/withdrawing treatments. According to Islamic European Council for Fatwa and Research (ECFR) (13) withholding/withdrawing treatments is permitted. Hinduism prohibits active euthanasia and assisted suicide, though the religion acknowledges death by starving “prayopavesa” (15), in order to achieve spiritual contact and salvation. Buddhism is careful when it comes to decisions of withholding treatments, because of the families` and doctors` individual intentions, like heredity and their own gains. Conclusion: The goal of this article is to give the readers a broad perspective of withholding/withdrawing treatments related to different religions. This is important in order to understand other cultures and to prevent miscommunications among clinicians and patients/families. Systematic approaches and clear communications about withholding/withdrawing treatments should be given more attention when it comes to similar cases...|$|R

40|$|Background & Aims: The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer {{intermediate}} stage (BCLC-B) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) includes extremely heterogeneous patients {{in terms of}} tumour burden and liver function. Transarterial-chemoembolization (TACE) is the first-line treatment for these patients {{although it may be}} risky/useless for someone, while others could undergo <b>curative</b> <b>treatments.</b> This study assesses the treatment type performed in a large cohort of BCLC-B patients and its outcome. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 485 consecutive BCLC-B patients from the ITA. LI. CA database diagnosed with naïve HCC after 1999. Patients were stratified by treatment. Results: 29 patients (6 %) were lost to follow-up before receiving treatment. Treatment distribution was: TACE (233, 51. 1 %), <b>curative</b> <b>treatments</b> (145 patients, 31. 8 %), sorafenib (18, 3. 9 %), other (39, 8. 5 %), best supportive care (BSC) (21, 4. 6 %). Median survival (95 % CI) was 45 months (37. 4 - 52. 7) for <b>curative</b> <b>treatments,</b> 30 (24. 7 - 35. 3) for TACE, 14 (10. 5 - 17. 5) for sorafenib, 14 (5. 2 - 22. 7) for other treatments and 10 (6. 0 - 14. 2) for BSC (P<. 0001). Independent prognosticators were gender and <b>treatment.</b> <b>Curative</b> <b>treatments</b> reduced mortality (HR 0. 197, 95 %CI: 0. 098 - 0. 395) more than TACE (HR 0. 408, 95 %CI: 0. 211 - 0. 789) (P<. 0001) as compared with BSC. Propensity score matching confirmed the superiority of curative therapies over TACE. Conclusions: In everyday practice TACE represents the first-line therapy in an half of patients with naïve BCLC-B HCC since treatment choice is driven not only by liver function and nodule characteristics, but also by contraindications to procedures, comorbidities, age and patient opinion. The treatment type is an independent prognostic factor in BCLC-B patients and curative options offer the best outcome...|$|R

25|$|Although the {{widespread}} use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in the US has resulted in diagnosis at earlier age and cancer stage, the vast majority of cases are still diagnosed in men older than 65 years, and approximately 25% of cases are diagnosed in men older than 75 years. Though US National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend using life expectancy greater than or less than 10 years to help make treatment decisions, in practice, many elderly patients are not offered <b>curative</b> <b>treatment</b> options such as radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy and are instead treated with hormonal therapy or watchful waiting. This pattern can be attributed to factors such as medical co-morbidity and patient preferences is regard to quality of life in addition to prostate cancer specific risk factors such as pretreatment PSA, Gleason score and clinical stage. As the average life expectancy increases due to advances in the treatment of cardiovascular, pulmonary and other chronic diseases, it is likely that more elderly patients will be living long enough to suffer the consequences of their prostate cancer. Therefore, there is currently much interest in the role of aggressive prostate cancer treatment modalities such as with surgery or radiation in the elderly population who have localized disease.|$|E
25|$|One {{option is}} to trade off an intact sexual {{function}} {{for the possibility of}} a prolonged life expectancy by not having <b>curative</b> <b>treatment.</b> The choice involves a trade-off so it is of central importance for the person and the physician to have access to information on established treatment benefits and side effects. A Swedish study found that the willingness {{to do this kind of}} trade-off varied considerably among men. While six out of ten were willing to consider a trade-off between life expectancy and intact sexual function, given the present knowledge of treatment benefits for clinically localized prostate cancer, four out of ten stated that they would under all circumstances choose treatment irrespective of the risk for waning sexual function. Access to valid empirical information is crucial for such decision making. Key factors here are an individual’s feeling towards the illness, their emotional values and religious beliefs. A substantial proportion of people and physicians, experience stress in judging the trade-off between different treatment options and treatment side-effects which adds to the stress of cancer diagnosed, a situation made worse in that eight out of ten people with prostate cancer have no one to confide in except their spouse and one out of five live in total emotional isolation.|$|E
