5|$|Casinos {{and race}} tracks were closed because {{official}} monitors from the New Jersey Casino Control Commission and the New Jersey Racing Commission, respectively, {{were categorized as}} non-essential. At the time, New Jersey law precluded gambling establishments from operating absent state oversight.

The casinos attempted a similar case, arguing that the state monitors overseeing the casinos were not paid by the state but by the casinos themselves, but the appeal was rejected at the New Jersey Supreme Court; therefore {{they were forced to}} <b>close.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a door <b>closer</b> which has a <b>closing</b> spring for automatically <b>closing</b> the door. When the door is opened manually, the <b>closing</b> spring is compressed. An opening resistance is thus produced. The door is then <b>closed</b> automatically through {{the action of the}} <b>closing</b> spring. To obtain greater operating convenience, the invention strives to achieve as low an opening resistance in the door <b>closer</b> as possible when the door is opened manually, but nevertheless <b>closing</b> the door reliably during the <b>closing</b> process. This problem is solved {{by the fact that the}} characteristic of the torque acting on the leaf and depending on the rotary angle of the leaf is different for opening than for <b>closing</b> as a result of the interaction of the sliding spring with a control curve which has separate curve sections for opening and <b>closing.</b> This is achieved by a gear wheel in the form of a cam gear interacting with the <b>closing</b> spring with one opening cam and one <b>closing</b> cam. The separate control curve section for opening is on the opening cam and the separate control curve section for <b>closing</b> is on the <b>closing</b> cam. Between the <b>closing</b> spring and the opening and <b>closing</b> cams there is a pressure piece controlled by a switching spring...|$|R
