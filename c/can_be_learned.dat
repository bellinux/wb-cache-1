A matha (hut) in a forest is ideal, but any private place that is free from distractions, high winds or intense {{sunshine}} is a good location for yoga. Either a pad made of kusha grass or a solid ground with deer skin mat on it, is desirable. Yoga <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>learned,</b> {{with the help of}} a teacher, within three to four months if practiced six times a day. If frequent practice is not possible, yoga can be mastered over a period of three to four years.|$|E
5|$|The game {{includes}} a research function. When new objects are {{encountered in the}} game, especially enemies, their organs can be collected and, when combined with chemicals found in storage rooms, the player can research the enemies and thus improve their damage against them. Similarly, some exotic weapons and items can only be used after being researched. OSA agents effectively have a separate weapons tree available to them. Psionic powers <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>learned,</b> such as invisibility, fireballs, and teleportation.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{philosophers}} of diverse orientations have challenged many of Fodor's ideas. For example, the language of thought hypothesis {{has been accused of}} either falling prey to an infinite regress or of being superfluous. Specifically, Simon Blackburn suggested in an article in 1984 that since Fodor explains the learning of natural languages as a process of formation and confirmation of hypotheses in the LOT, this leaves him open to the question of why the LOT itself should not be considered as just such a language which requires yet another and more fundamental representational substrate in which to form and confirm hypotheses so that the LOT itself <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>learned.</b> If natural language learning requires some representational substrate (the LOT) in order for it to be learned, why shouldn't the same be said for the LOT itself and then for the representational substrate of this representational substrate and so on, ad infinitum? On the other hand, if such a representational substrate is not required for the LOT, then why should it be required for the learning of natural languages? In this case, the LOT would be superfluous. Fodor, in response, argues that the LOT is unique in that it {{does not have to be}} learned via an antecedent language because it is innate.|$|E

5|$|At {{the center}} of the massive ship, V'Ger is {{revealed}} to be Voyager 6, a 20th-century Earth space probe believed lost. The damaged probe was found by an alien race of living machines that interpreted its programming as instructions to learn all that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>learned,</b> and return that information to its creator. The machines upgraded the probe to fulfill its mission, and on its journey the probe gathered so much knowledge that it achieved consciousness. Spock realizes that V'Ger lacks the ability to give itself a focus other than its original mission; having learned what it could on its journey home, it finds its existence empty and without purpose. Before transmitting all its information, V'Ger insists that the Creator come in person to finish the sequence. Realizing that the machine wants to merge with its creator, Decker offers himself to V'Ger; he merges with the Ilia probe and V'Ger, creating a new form of life that disappears into another dimension. With Earth saved, Kirk directs Enterprise out to space for future missions.|$|E
5|$|He also gains {{the ability}} to constrict objects and enemies with a band of energy, {{although}} this feature {{was one of the}} few abilities not to feature in future games. Players can find an ancient relic that gives Raziel the power to fire bolts of telekinetic energy, which cause little damage by themselves but can knock enemies into hazards and push objects from a distance. Baptism in holy flame can transform the Soul Reaver into the Fire Reaver, which can set enemies aflame and adds fire to Raziel's telekinetic bolts. Players can also find magical glyphs that allow Raziel to expend magical energy to attack groups of enemies simultaneously. These glyphs typically involve vampire weaknesses such as sunlight, fire, water, or sound, as well as additions such as telekinetic force (available well before the normal telekinesis becomes available) and the causing of earthquakes to temporarily stun enemies. Glyphs are acquired through finding glyph altars, specific locations in Nosgoth where the skills <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>learned,</b> and solving a puzzle before being granted the magical ability. However, Raziel begins the game with access to the 'Shift' glyph, granting {{the ability to}} shift between the material and spectral planes, with no glyph altar necessary.|$|E
5|$|Tied {{into the}} battle {{system is a}} Job system: {{beginning}} with the Freelancer, the party can gain additional Jobs by obtaining gems called Asterisks from defeated human bosses. Twenty-four Jobs {{can be found in}} the game, ranging from the agile Valkyrie, and White and Black Mages that respectively specialize in healing and fighting magic. Each Job has different strengths and weaknesses in battle. Outside battle, characters can be assigned any available Job. In addition to the skills of the equipped Job, the skills of a second Job <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>learned,</b> allowing for free customization of parties and the mixing of Job abilities in battle. After obtaining the Summoner Job, characters can use summoned monsters to launch attacks that deal high damage on all enemies. Friend characters can also be summoned from other players' games: the more a friend summon is used, the more effective their actions become. Descriptions of defeated enemies, along with story recaps and descriptions of locations, are included in an item called D's journal.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe consider, {{within the}} {{framework}} of inductive inference, the concept of refuting learning as introduced by Mukouchi and Arikawa, where the learner is not only required to learn all concepts in a given class but also has to explicitly refute concepts outside the class. In {{the first part of the}} paper, we consider learning from text and introduce a concept of limit-refuting <b>learning</b> that <b>is</b> intermediate between refuting learning and reliable learning. We give characterizations for these concepts and show some results about their relative strength and their relation to confident learning. In the second part of the paper we consider learning from texts that for some k contain all positive Πk-formulae that are valid in the standard structure determined by the set to <b>be</b> <b>learned.</b> In this model, the following results are shown. For the language with successor, any countable axiomatizable class <b>can</b> <b>be</b> limit-refuting <b>learned</b> from Π 1 -texts. For the language with successor and order, any countable axiomatizable class <b>can</b> <b>be</b> reliably <b>learned</b> from Π 1 -texts and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> limit-refuting <b>learned</b> from Π 2 -texts, whereas the axiomatizable class of all finite sets cannot <b>be</b> limit-refuting <b>learned</b> from Π 1 -texts. For the full language of arithmetic, which contains in addition plus and times, for any even k there is an axiomatizable class that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> limit-refuting <b>learned</b> from Πk+ 1 -texts but not from Πk-texts. A similar result with k+ 3 in place of k+ 1 holds with respect to the language of Presburger's arithmetic...|$|R

25|$|Invariant {{representations}} {{has been}} incorporated into several learning architectures, such as neocognitrons.

25|$|Two {{other major}} subfields of {{psycholinguistics}} investigate first language acquisition, {{the process by}} which infants acquire language, and second language acquisition. In addition, it is much more difficult for adults to acquire second languages than it is for infants to learn their first language (bilingual infants are able to learn both of their native languages easily). Thus, sensitive periods may exist during which language <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>learned</b> readily.

25|$|In the {{introductory}} section, it was claimed that M-Theory allows to learn invariant representations.

However, as it is shown later, for some kinds of transformations, specific templates are needed.|$|E
