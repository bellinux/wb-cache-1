After a two year process of discussions via workshops and interviews including various stakeholders, four main research themes were selected: • Transformation towards sustainable development • Changing consumption patterns • Finance, capital and performance indicators • Technological breakthroughs.

40|$|Abstract Background Is the {{implementation}} of Quality Management (QM) in health care proceeding satisfactorily and can national health care policies influence {{the implementation}} process? Policymakers and researchers in a country {{need to know the}} answer to this question. Cross country comparisons can reveal whether sufficient progress is being made and how this can be stimulated. The objective {{of the study was to}} investigate agreement and disparities in {{the implementation of}} QMS between <b>The</b> <b>Netherlands,</b> Hungary and Finland with respect to the evaluation model used and the national policy strategy of the three countries. Methods The study has a cross sectional design, based on measurements in 2000. Empirical data about QM-activities in hospitals were gathered by a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaires were answered by the directors of the hospitals or <b>the</b> quality <b>coordinators.</b> <b>The</b> analyses are based on data from 101 hospitals in <b>the</b> <b>Netherlands,</b> 116 hospitals in Hungary and 59 hospitals in Finland. Outcome measures are the developmental stage of the Quality Management System (QMS), the development within five focal areas, and distinct QM-activities which were listed in the questionnaire. Results A mean of 22 QM-activities per hospital was found in <b>the</b> <b>Netherlands</b> and Finland versus 20 QM-activities in Hungarian hospitals. Only a small number of hospitals has already implemented a QMS (4 % in <b>The</b> <b>Netherlands,</b> 0 % in Hungary and 3 % in Finland). More hospitals in <b>the</b> <b>Netherlands</b> are concentrating on quality documents, whereas Finnish hospitals are concentrating on training in QM and guidelines. Cyclic quality improvement activities have been developed in the three countries, but in most hospitals the results were not used for improvements. All three countries pay hardly any attention to patient participation. Conclusion The study demonstrates that the implementation of QM-activities can be measured at national level and that differences between countries can be assessed. The hypothesis that governmental legislation or financial reimbursement can stimulate the implementation of QM-activities, more than voluntary recommendations, could not be confirmed. However, the results show that specific obligations can stimulate the implementation of QM-activities more than general, framework legislation. </p...|$|R

40|$|Railway dispatchers {{reschedule}} {{trains in}} real-time {{in order to}} limit the propagation of disturbances and to regulate traffic in their respective dispatching areas by minimizing the deviation from the off-line timetable. However, the decisions taken in one area may influence the quality and even the feasibility of train schedules in the other areas. Regional control centers coordinate the dispatchers' work for multiple areas in order to regulate traffic {{at the global level}} and to avoid situations of global infeasibility. Differently from the dispatcher problem, the coordination activity of regional control centers is still underinvestigated, even if this activity is a key factor for effective traffic management. This paper studies the problem of coordinating several dispatchers with the objective of driving their behavior towards globally optimal solutions. With our model, a coordinator may impose constraints at the border of each dispatching area. Each dispatcher must then schedule trains in its area by producing a locally feasible solution compliant with the border constraints imposed by <b>the</b> <b>coordinator.</b> <b>The</b> problem faced by <b>the</b> <b>coordinator</b> is therefore a bilevel programming problem in which the variables controlled by <b>the</b> <b>coordinator</b> are <b>the</b> border constraints. We demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>coordinator</b> problem can be solved to optimality with a branch and bound procedure. The coordination algorithm has been tested on a large real railway network in <b>the</b> <b>Netherlands</b> with busy traffic conditions. Our experimental results show that a proven optimal solution is frequently found for various network divisions within computation times compatible with real-time operations...|$|R

40|$|Objectives In {{addition}} to our target Muslim populations, we aim also to gather information on their community leaders, {{as well as the}} policy makers whose policies confront them. We aim through a series of semi-structured interviews to gain information on the position of a variety of community leaders who publicly represent their communities in the society of settlement. Here we aim to compare between leaders of religious organisations, and those of organisations which mobilise using ‘Muslim’ as a label for an ‘ethnic’ group, and/or ‘homeland’ labels (e. g. ‘Turkish’), which maybe more secular in their political orientation. This will allow us to examine variations in different community leaderships’ views of strategies for cultural interaction. A further possibility is {{that we will be able}} to investigate whether community elite positions vary significantly from those held by their communities according to their survey responses. Potentially, this will be important information to provide as feedback to the organisations as well as more generally to the public domain and the policy community. This work package also includes an in-depth analysis of the (interactive) policy processes that result in specific policy outcomes. Description of work In each country, we shall use media visibility (drawn from work package 2) as well as secondary information (e. g., attendance and consultation on interfaith and policy committees), to select between 15 - 20 important organisations per country, spread across the different groups. In addition, we propose also to interview the leaders of European- level organisations and transnational ones to the extent that they exist. We shall aim to interview organisations’ leaders. There will be a common set of questions and topics to address that will allow for reports at the national level, and then subsequent cross-national pooling of insights, information and comparative analysis. The interviews will be carried out face-to-face on the basis of a common interview grid prepared jointly by all the partners. Finally, we shall also conduct a small number of interviews with key policy-makers (12 - 15 in total including national and EU levels) who are directly involved in central government attempts to ‘outreach’ to Muslim communities. Each country will establish contact early in the project with a few key actors in this field (for example, in the UK, key actors from the Communities and Local Government Department) to ask advice and direction. Here our findings will be used as a basis for a series of questions to the policy makers with the expressed aim of providing feedback within a setting where a relationship has been established.
