50|$|Blowgun: A blowgun is a {{small hand}} held device used to blow away debris from a work area and is {{designed}} to be used attached to a <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>line.</b> It uses a sprung poppet valve operated by a lever to allow air through its body and out through a specially shaped nozzle. In spudgunning it is used to pilot larger valves—releasing a small volume of air to allow a piston or diaphragm to fly back and release a much larger volume of air into the barrel. It is also used as the primary valve for small cannons which fire airsoft pellets and so do not require high air flow. Blowguns can be modified to increase airflow.|$|E

In order to develop this work, an ultrasound test in the <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>line</b> was performed to identify and quantify leaks in the flow. Once the leaks were identified, they were eliminated through corrective maintenance and improvements, and then the energy consumption scenarios {{before and after the}} improvements were compared. As a result, the average monthly electricity consumption in the reporting period decreased by 57. 2 %. In addition, one compressor was set aside in stand-by condition, as in the original plant.

30|$|The {{non-contact}} wettability assessment {{system was}} mainly {{composed of two}} parts: (1) an air-jet application part and (2) a part for the acquisition and analysis of liquid behavior. The air-jet application part had a <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>line</b> from an air compressor as an air source (PC 3 - 5.5 T; Yaezaki Kuatsu, Tokyo, Japan) to an air nozzle and the line was equipped with a pressure regulator (IR 2000 -A; SMC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), a particle filter (ZFC 53; SMC), and solenoid valve (custom-made; SMC). Both pressures {{before and after the}} solenoid valve were monitored by pressure sensors (PSE 540; SMC). The air-jet was switched by the solenoid valve that was controlled from a laptop computer (ProBook 650 G 1; HP, Palo Alto, CA). The liquid behavior in a sample container on the measurement table of the system was monitored by a digital camera located above the table. The surface temperature of the measurement table was controlled by a heater according to the user’s requirements. The relative position between the air nozzle and measurement table could be adjusted with the XYZ-three-axis motorized stage (XY-axes: KYL 06, Suruga Seiki, Shizuoka, Japan and Z-axis: DRSM 42, Oriental Motor, Tokyo, Japan) via numerical control from the computer.

40|$|Air-stirring motors {{are often}} viewed with {{disparagement}} {{in the laboratory}} because of the rather large amount of noise which attends their use. This noise may be traced to four sources: (1) that arising from the turbulent discharge of <b>air</b> from· the <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>lines</b> into tubing connecting with the motor; (2) that due to air rushing through the pipes and the connecting tubing; (3) that inherent {{in the use of}} an air motor, i. e. bearing noise and the clear tone of audio-frequency which is associated with all turbines; and (4) that resulting from the air rushing out of the small escape ports generally provided in the flat surface on top of the motor. Of these sources, the first and fourth are by far the most important because of both the intensity and the raucous character of the noise arising from them. The devices suggested here have been found very useful in reducing to a very large extent the noise from these two sources.

In fact, these components join very low costs with high lifetime {{because they have no}} moving parts. While on the anodic side an ejector allows to avoid high temperature and expensive blowers to recirculate part of the exhausted gases, on the cathodic side a recirculation based on the ejector technology is so cheap and safe to justify an efficiency decrease. To improve the ejector performance inside the hybrid systems this activity has started at TPG with a preliminary design of an anodic ejector developed using a preliminary 0 -D model based on the global balances of mass, momentum and energy. Then, the theoretical activity has been improved with the development of an experimental rig to test single stage ejectors for hybrid systems at different operative conditions of mass flow rates, pressures and temperatures. At first, an open circuit has been built to perform tests at atmospheric conditions in the secondary flow and connecting the primary inlet to the <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>line.</b> Then, to emulate a SOFC anodic recirculation, the circuit has been closed introducing a fuel cell volume in a reduced scale. This configuration is important to test ejectors at pressurized conditions both at primary and secondary ducts. Finally, the volume has been equipped and thermally insulated to test ejectors with high temperature secondary flow, necessary to reach values in similitude condition with the real ones. This test rig has been used to validate the 0 -D ejector model with the objective to set the values of the coefficients used {{to take into account the}} primary momentum loss and the mixing chamber viscous pressure losses. On the other hand, a successful comparison with the experimental data, measured with the rig, has been used to validate the CFD models necessary to better investigate the fluid dynamic phenomena inside ejectors. In fact, the application of CFD validated models has allowed to improve the performance of ejectors for hybrid systems optimizing the geometry in terms of primary and secondary ducts, mixing chamber length and diffuser geometry...|$|E
40|$|Three major {{coal mining}} {{disasters}} occurred in 2006, involving either fires or explosions, killing 19 miners. In {{all of these}} tragedies, miners survived the initial disaster but were unable either to escape or successfully isolate themselves from the poisonous gases present in the mine environment resulting from the disaster. In response, Congress passed the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act (MINER Act) of 2006 (Public Law 109 - 236). Among its mandates, the MINER Act called for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) to "provide {{for the conduct of}} research, including field tests, concerning the utility, practicality, survivability, and cost of various refuge alternatives in an underground coal mine environment, including commercially-available portable refuge chambers. " The primary function of a refuge alternative (RA) is to provide safe refuge for miners unable to escape their work area immediately after a disaster due to toxic gases or a blocked escapeway. To be effective, the RA must survive the initiation of the disaster, whether it is an explosion or fire. Furthermore, it would additionally be beneficial if it would protect the miners inside the RA from the blast impacts of a secondary explosion. In response to the MINER Act mandate, NIOSH OMSHR conducted research on refuge alternatives and provided its findings {{in the form of a}} report to Congress [NIOSH 2007]. In sum, this report found that refuge alternatives were practical for use in most underground coal mines to facilitate escape and to serve as a refuge of last resort, provided that mine operators develop comprehensive escape and rescue plans incorporating refuge alternatives and training on their use. These findings applied to both portable RAs and built-in-place (BIP) RAs, with the BIP RAs emerging as being able to provide a superior environment. They offer the potential to provide miners with an improved psychological and physiological environment, which can be greatly advantageous to their health and safety in the stress of an emergency, and they can be provided with fresh air via a borehole to the surface or a protected <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>line.</b> Despite these advantages, current BIP RA designs cannot be moved frequently from a practical standpoint - with movement of the RA location required to keep up with dynamic mining production - and as such it would generally be impractical to keep them within 1, 000 feet of the nearest working face, as prescribed in 30 CFR 11 75. 1506 (c). Notwithstanding, OMSHR's 2007 report to Congress on refuge alternatives concluded that, as compared to portable RAs, the strengths of built-in-place refuge alternatives "are so significant that consideration should be given to allowing extended distances, if in-place shelters are used to provide refuge for face workers" [NIOSH 2007]. Currently, there are approximately 30 BIP RAs in U. S. underground coal mines; however, all of these are located outby the face area and none are designed to be advanced with the working face. The usage of BIP RAs that can be advanced with the working face will only be practical if three issues can be addressed: (1) locating BIP RAs further from the face; (2) providing a consistent process for the design and approval of RA stoppings; (3) delivering a reliable supply of clean, breathable air to a BIP RA. In this Report of Investigations, these three issues are explored in detail. NIOSHTOC No 2004597...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Navy Public Works Center San Diego (PWCSD) was {{concerned}} about the accuracy of various flow meters on steam and <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>lines</b> serving Naval facilities in San Diego, California. The flow meters had experienced various inconsistencies that had not been resolved prior to July 1993. Pacific Northwest Laboratory, Richland, Washington, evaluated the operation of 10 out of 79 steam and <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> flow meters at PWCSD. The evaluation was limited to analysis of historical information and review of existing operating procedures. On-site investigation of the flow meters was limited to external observations of the flow-sensing equipment and a check of the flow computer program. PNL did not remove installed sensing equipment (i. e., flow meters or temperature or pressure sensors) to evaluate existing condition or check calibration. Although many of the flow meter errors can be traced to improperly normalized readings and to meters improperly compensated for temperature and pressure, lack of regular maintenance, including proper calibration, was evidenced throughout this study. A strict calibration schedule should be established for all steam and air flow meters, including calibration of the temperature sensor, pressure sensor, and flow turbine. It is recommended that the most crucial flow meters (such as the 10 evaluated in this study) be calibrated yearly. The remaining 69 flow meters could be placed on a staggered, biyearly calibration schedule. Calibration should be done by qualified personnel only. Improper calibration is often worse than no calibration at all. An outside firm is recommended to be contracted with to perform all maintenance and calibration on flow meters at the Naval facilities. Use of an outside firm would better facilitate regular, reliable calibration while removing liability for damaged parts...|$|R

40|$|Research on single-model {{assembly}} line balancing has produced several good algorithms for solving large problems. All these algorithms, however, generate just one {{solution to the}} balancing problem. With these, line designers wishing to investigate alternative station combinations of work elements are forced to do so manually. This paper concerns an algorithm (MUST) which generates alternative solutions of equal quality for single-model {{assembly line}} balancing problems. The method {{is based on the}} Mansoor-Yadin algorithm and in its optimum seeking form, MUST generates all existing optimal balances in a single pass. Three heuristics, used singularly or together, are introduced for solving the larger balancing problems. These are designed to produce about 100 different balance solutions of equal quality at each pass. MUST has been successfully used in balancing assembly lines having up to 140 work elements with widely differing precedence structures. A comparison of this method with MALB, one of the most efficient known heuristic methods, results in MUST dominating or equalling MALB in every case. Reasonable computation times (average 125. 4 sec. [...] IBM 370 / 168) and core usage are achieved through the use of advanced computation methods. The need to explore alternative station combinations may arise in several ways [...] for example, the line designer may prefer (but not require) that certain work elements be allocated to a common station either because of: access to materials handling and storage facilities, service availability (e. g., <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>lines),</b> use of common tools or operator skills, etc. Alternatively, minor adjustments to the line may be required between adjacent stations in order to alleviate conditions at one station which exhibits excessive variability in its performance times. The generation of multiple solutions of equal efficiency adds a new dimension to the quality of balancing effectiveness, enabling the line designer to select the alternative that best suits his requirements. production/scheduling: line balancing, production/scheduling, networks/graphs...|$|R
