40|$|The {{quantization}} of the scalar and {{electromagnetic fields}} {{in the presence of}} a <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror</b> is further developed in the context of a geometric optics approximation. We calculate the mean squared scalar and electric fields near the focal line of a <b>parabolic</b> <b>cylindrical</b> <b>mirror.</b> These quantities are found to grow as inverse powers of the distance from the focus. We give a combination of analytic and numerical results for the mean squared fields. In particular, we find that the mean squared electric field can be either negative or positive, depending upon the choice of parameters. The case of a negative mean squared electric field corresponds to a repulsive Van der Waals force on an atom near the focus, and to a region of negative energy density. Similarly, a positive value corresponds to an attractive force and a possibility of atom trapping in the vicinity of the focus. PACS categories: 03. 70. +k, 34. 20. Cf, 12. 20.

40|$|In {{the current}} work, {{several types of}} solar collectors, i. e. <b>parabolic,</b> <b>cylindrical,</b> and <b>mirrors,</b> were {{designed}} and fabricated. The {{aim of this study}} is to integrate the optimum collector with Stirling engine in Malacca city, Malaysia. Stirling engine was designed using CATIA software. The solar collectors were tested for several sunny days and the temperature in the focus point was mea- sured. Comparing the experiment results shows that mirror solar collector introduces highest temperature among others, which was about 190 C. According to that tem- perature, the Stirling engine has been designed in bore piston dimension of 50 mm. Alpha Stirling engine type was selected for this purpose, which may run in this range of temperature. ...|$|R

50|$|A perfect <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror</b> {{will bring}} {{parallel}} rays to a focus {{at a single}} point. Conversely, a point source at {{the focus of a}} <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror</b> will produce a beam of collimated light creating a Collimator. Since the source needs to be small, such an optical system cannot produce much optical power. Spherical mirrors are easier to make than <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirrors</b> and they are often used to produce approximately collimated light. Many types of lenses can also produce collimated light from point-like sources.|$|R
40|$|Focusing with a 4 π <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror</b> {{allows for}} concentrating light from nearly the {{complete}} solid angle, whereas focusing {{with a single}} microscope objective limits the angle cone used for focusing to half solid angle at maximum. Increasing the solid angle by using deep <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirrors</b> comes {{at the cost of}} adding more complexity to the mirror's fabrication process and might introduce errors that reduce the focusing quality. To determine these errors, we experimentally examine the focusing properties of a 4 π <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror</b> that was produced by single-point diamond turning. The properties are characterized with a single ^ 174 Yb^+ ion as a mobile point scatterer. The ion is trapped in a vacuum environment with a movable high optical access Paul trap. We demonstrate an effective focal spot size of 209 nm in lateral and 551 nm in axial direction. Such tight focusing allows us to build an efficient light-matter interface. Our findings agree with numerical simulations incorporating a finite ion temperature and interferometrically measured wavefront aberrations induced by the <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror.</b> We point at further technological improvements and discuss the general scope of applications of a 4 π <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror...</b>|$|R

40|$|A gated {{spectrometer}} {{has been}} designed for real-time, pulsed infrared (IR) studies at the National Synchrotron Light ource at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. A pair of 90 -degree, off-axis <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirrors</b> are used to relay the light from an entrance slit to an output IR recording camera. With an initial wavelength range of 1500 – 4500 nm required, gratings {{could not be used}} in the spectrometer because grating orders would overlap. A magnesium oxide prism, placed between these <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirrors,</b> serves as the dispersion element. The spectrometer is doubly telecentric. With proper choice of the air spacing between the prism and the second <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror,</b> any spectral region of interest within the InSb camera array’s sensitivity region can be recorded. The wavelengths leaving the second <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror</b> are collimated, thereby relaxing the camera positioning tolerance. To set up the instrument, two different wavelength (visible) lasers are introduced at the entrance slit and made collinear with the optical axis via flip mirrors. After dispersion by the prism, these two laser beams are directed to tick marks located on the outside housing of the gated IR camera. This provides first-order wavelength calibration for the instrument. Light that is reflected off the front prism face is coupled into a high-speed detector to verify steady radiance during the gated spectral imaging. Alignment features include tick marks on the prism and <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirrors.</b> This instrument was designed to complement singlepoint pyrometry, which provides continuous time histories of a small collection of spots from shock-heated targets...|$|R
40|$|Thermal imaging is an important, though challenging, {{diagnostic}} for shockwave experiments. Shock-compressed materials undergo {{transient temperature}} changes that cannot be recorded with standard (greater than ms response time) infrared detectors. A further complication arises when optical elements near the experiment are destroyed. We have designed a thermal-imaging system for studying shock temperatures produced inside a gas gun at Sandia National Laboratories. Inexpensive, diamond-turned, <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirrors</b> relay {{an image of}} the shocked target to the exterior of the gas gun chamber through a sapphire vacuum port. The 3000 – 5000 -nm portion of this image is directed to an infrared camera which acquires a snapshot of the target with a minimum exposure time of 150 ns. A special mask is inserted at the last intermediate image plane, to provide dynamic thermal background recording during the event. Other wavelength bands of this image are split into high-speed detectors operating at 900 – 1700 nm, and at 1700 – 3000 nm for timeresolved pyrometry measurements. This system incorporates 90 -degree, off-axis <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirrors,</b> which can collect low f/# light over a broad spectral range, for high-speed imaging. Matched mirror pairs must be used so that aberrations cancel. To eliminate image plane tilt, proper tip-to-tip orientation of the <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirrors</b> is required. If one <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirror</b> is rotated 180 degrees about the optical axis connecting the pair of <b>parabolic</b> <b>mirrors,</b> the resulting image is tilted by 60 degrees. Different focal-length mirrors cannot be used to magnify the image without substantially sacrificing image quality. This paper analyzes performance and aberrations of this imaging diagnostic...|$|R
