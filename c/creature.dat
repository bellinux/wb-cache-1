5|$|As {{the others}} plot {{to destroy the}} <b>creature</b> with improvised gas bombs and flares, Corcoran flees the station and finds the <b>creature</b> in a nearby cave. After {{consuming}} Wyman's brain, the <b>creature</b> is now able {{to speak with the}} scientist's voice and has absorbed his knowledge. Corcoran asks whether Wyman's death was needed, but the <b>creature</b> insists it was a necessary sacrifice. The others arrive to destroy the <b>creature,</b> but hesitate because Corcoran will not step aside and let them throw their bombs. The <b>creature</b> insists it is not an evil monster, but an intelligent alien who has come to Earth to save the human race from its own self-destructive tendencies. It explains that Corcoran's body has been implanted with its embryos, which will allow the alien species to multiply and take over the human race, which the <b>creature</b> claims {{is the only way to}} truly save humanity. Upon realizing the <b>creature</b> is forcing the will of its species on the human race, Corcoran concludes the <b>creature</b> is evil after all and commits suicide so its embryos cannot come to fruition. The others then throw their explosives and kill the <b>creature,</b> which in its dying breaths warns that others from his species are waiting in space and will return one day to conquer humanity.|$|E
5|$|Certain planes feature aggressive, multi-segmented {{creatures that}} perish {{when all of}} their {{segments}} are eaten by the player's creature; however, they can eat segments of the player's <b>creature</b> to regrow their own. These creatures release many cells upon death, which can restore {{the health of the}} player's <b>creature,</b> temporarily increase the size of its mouth, or cause it to sprout decorative protrusions. Players are not required to eat these or any other organisms; they may travel to higher or lower planes at any time. Being defeated by aggressive creatures does not result in death, but causes the player's <b>creature</b> to float to a higher plane. In the Flash version, the player can replay the game with a jellyfish-like organism by defeating an aggressive <b>creature</b> on the bottom plane. If the player reaches the bottom again, the <b>creature</b> there is their original worm-like <b>creature,</b> and defeating it starts the game over as that organism.|$|E
5|$|During an autopsy, Scully {{correctly}} deduces that Arlen was {{blinded by}} reptile venom. Meanwhile, Doggett and Harrison, having fallen into old bootlegger tunnels below the mansion grounds, encounter the <b>creature</b> and are sprayed with venom, temporarily blinding them. The two find Gary Sacks {{in dire need}} of medical attention nearby. Noting Doggett and Harrison's absence, Mulder searches the area around the mansion for clues and encounters the owner, Herman Stites, who identifies himself as a biologist. Mulder soon leaves the area as Stites notices Doggett about to escape the tunnels and knocks him back in. Mulder waits in his car in Stites' driveway until dark, telling Scully that he found the Apollo medallion near Stites' estate and is convinced Doggett is somewhere nearby. He spots the <b>creature</b> and chases it to the mansion where it climbs up to a second floor. Mulder follows the <b>creature</b> into the house and down into the tunnels, where he encounters Harrison and Doggett. With the <b>creature</b> approaching, Mulder tells the still-blinded Doggett to open fire at him on his command. The blinded Doggett then shoots the <b>creature</b> as it leaps at Mulder; the deceased <b>creature</b> then turns into Stites.|$|E

Ernie stays inside and is butchered by the bat <b>creature.</b> Scully returns {{to see it}} ravaging Ernie; she manages to shoot it before being knocked down. Doggett appears and shoots the <b>creature</b> several more times, saving Scully. The <b>creature</b> disappears into the night while Scully helps the injured Doggett.|$|E
5|$|Lionhead Studios used Michael Bratman's belief–desire–intention {{model to}} {{simulate}} creatures' learning {{and decision making}} processes. A <b>creature</b> forms an intention by combining desires, opinions, and beliefs. Beliefs are attributed to lists that store data about various world objects. Desires are goals the <b>creature</b> wants to fulfill, expressed as simplified perceptrons. Opinions describe ways of satisfying a desire using decision trees. For each desire, the <b>creature</b> selects the belief with the best opinion, thus forming an intention or goal.|$|E

50|$|The final major <b>Creatures</b> {{release was}} a re-release in 2001 by FastTrak Software Publishing as <b>Creatures</b> Internet Edition, {{a bundle of}} <b>Creatures</b> 3, <b>Creatures</b> 3 Update 2, Docking Station, {{and a number of}} {{environment}} extras and tools (many with multilingual variants). Linux Game Publishing released a Linux port of <b>Creatures</b> Internet Edition a few months later in December 2001.|$|R
50|$|This {{release of}} <b>Creatures</b> Trilogy {{included}} <b>Creatures,</b> <b>Creatures</b> 2, and <b>Creatures</b> 3, {{as well as}} the Life Kit addons for the earlier games. It was released before Docking Station, but the version of <b>Creatures</b> 3 included in this was identical to the original release (except that it was using the newest patch) and was therefore compatible with Docking Station.|$|R
5|$|The team {{tries to}} call for further assistance, but find the radio is no longer working. Randall heads outside to check the power transformers, and is {{attacked}} by a large <b>creature</b> (Ross Sturlin) hiding in the underbrush around the station. Randall fires a few shots at the <b>creature</b> with his pistol and escapes unscathed. Although {{he did not get}} a good look at the <b>creature,</b> he describes it to the rest of the team as similar in size to a bear. Later, the team finds the infirmary has been trashed and Corcoran's body is gone. They initially believe the <b>creature</b> has broken in and stole the corpse, but are shocked to instead find Corcoran has mysteriously regained consciousness. Upon checking his blood again, there is no trace of the mysterious cells from before, but after investigating Corcoran's body, they find the cells have changed into lizard-like fetuses and entered into his abdominal cavity. The <b>creature</b> later breaks into the lab again, this time beheading Dr. Wyman. Randall and Dunlap are initially suspicious that Corcoran was involved in the death, which he denies, but it appears he has some sort of telepathic connection with the <b>creature.</b> Despite Wyman's death, Corcoran does not believe the <b>creature</b> is evil, but rather simply misunderstood. He implores the others to give the <b>creature</b> a chance to explain its actions, and asks that they not condemn it as a monster simply because it is different.|$|E
5|$|To {{implement}} {{the transformation of}} the <b>creature</b> based on its alignment, Alex Evans developed an exporter program to export 3D Studio Max's models and animations, and Roberts created one to import them and apply them to the lion. Each version of the <b>creature</b> was then loaded, and interpolation code was written, as well as a blended animation between two similar ones. The system has a two-way blend: one for the alignment, and the other for how fat the <b>creature</b> is. As there {{was not going to be}} many creatures on one map, the team were able to use CPU resources to run many animations simultaneously on a single <b>creature.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{waiting for}} help to arrive, they make phone calls to their {{respective}} families. A lone <b>creature</b> silently approaches the station. Hiding, Samantha observes several tentacles exploring {{the inside of the}} store, seemingly soaking up a television's light. Samantha quickly unplugs the television and the <b>creature</b> loses interest. Another <b>creature</b> appears, and they communicate with one another and possibly mate via light impulses. The creatures leave as the military arrives. Samantha and Andrew kiss before they are rushed into different vehicles. The chronological ending takes place {{at the beginning of the}} film, filmed in green night vision sight, when the military rescue team is attacked by a single <b>creature.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Creatures</b> are {{attracted}} via Portals. Which ones come {{depend on the}} dungeon's composition. Each has its own abilities (such as spells they can cast), expertise, and job preferences. <b>Creatures</b> include Bile Demons, Warlocks, and Salamanders. Like the first game, <b>creatures</b> can be slapped with the hand to make them work harder, {{at the cost of}} their health. Certain <b>creatures,</b> such as Vampires and Skeletons cannot be attracted via Portals. They are obtained by their corpse decomposing in a Graveyard, and dying in captivity respectively. Certain sacrifices in the Temple, a room where <b>creatures</b> pray, also yield the acquisition of certain <b>creatures.</b> <b>Creatures</b> frequently enter combat (each follow one of four combat strategies) against <b>creatures</b> belonging to enemy keepers, or heroic forces defending the realm. Heroes enter the level via Hero Gates. The heroics forces are composed of different units to keepers: heroes include Wizards, Giants, and Guards. Most <b>creatures</b> have a heroic counterpart: for example, the Wizard is the counterpart of the Warlock. Heroes and rival keepers' <b>creatures</b> can be converted to the player's cause in the torture chamber after being captured and imprisoned. <b>Creatures</b> dislike their heroic counterparts, and their company may make them angry, which can lead to rebellions. Rebelling <b>creatures</b> either leave the dungeon, or defect to another keeper or the heroes, and may take other <b>creatures</b> too. Other things that can annoy <b>creatures</b> and cause rebellions include lack of food, not getting paid (<b>creatures</b> require payment on a regular basis), and being slapped.|$|R
50|$|There {{are five}} tribes of <b>creatures</b> in Chaotic: OverWorld, UnderWorld, Danian, Mipedian and M'arrillian. The OverWorld is a tribe made of various {{humanoid}} <b>creatures</b> and <b>creatures</b> which resemble real animals. The UnderWorld is a tribe {{which consists of}} <b>creatures</b> which resemble various monsters. Danians are usually made to resemble ants {{but there are some}} <b>creatures</b> based on other insects found within the tribe. Mipedians are a tribe which is made of <b>creatures</b> who resemble various lizards. The M'arrillians are a tribe which resembles various deep sea <b>creatures,</b> some of which have a see through appearance such as that found in a jellyfish.|$|R
5000|$|Creatures: <b>Creatures</b> are {{the most}} {{important}} cards in the game. <b>Creatures</b> are summoned into the battle zone by paying their mana cost. They can attack your opponents <b>creatures,</b> shields or the opponent himself. Breaking all of your opponents shields and then attacking the opponent is how you win the game. <b>Creatures</b> that have been summoned usually have summoning sickness and cannot attack in the same turn (with exception to evolution <b>creatures</b> and <b>creatures</b> with card effects like [...] "Speed Attacker").|$|R
5|$|A man—whose face {{is hidden}} from the camera—drives up to and enters a house, which has an ominous symbol drawn in blood on the door. When he's inside, a <b>creature</b> that looks {{somewhat}} human-like approaches the woman but the mysterious man shoots the <b>creature</b> three times. As he returns to his car his identity is finally revealed: Agent Fox Mulder.|$|E

5|$|Animal {{rights activists}} ransack a {{laboratory}} and unwittingly release a <b>creature</b> with a ferocious appetite. As they flee in an SUV, the <b>creature</b> follows and grotesquely mutilates them. The Fringe team consisting of FBI agents Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo), Philip Broyles (Lance Reddick), and civilian consultants Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter Bishop (John Noble) arrives, and Walter sees evidence of different creatures' {{marks on the}} bodies. Olivia realizes {{one of them is}} missing, and after interviewing a student at MIT to try to identify the victims, she realizes they were animal rights activists. While conducting autopsies on the bodies, an animal control team at a different site is killed by the <b>creature</b> after investigating a call.|$|E
40|$|Virtual <b>creatures</b> play an {{increasingly}} important role in computer graphics as special eects and background characters. The articial evolution of such <b>creatures</b> potentially oers some relief from the dicult and time consuming task of specifying morphologies and behaviors. But, while articial life techniques {{have been used to}} create a variety of virtual <b>creatures,</b> previous work has not scaled beyond <b>creatures</b> with 50 components and the most recent work has generated <b>creatures</b> that are unnatural looking. Here we describe a system that uses Lindenmayer systems (L-systems) as the encoding of an evolutionary algorithm (EA) for creating virtual <b>creatures.</b> <b>Creatures</b> evolved by this system have hundreds of parts, and the use of an L-system as the encoding results in <b>creatures</b> with a more natural look...|$|R

5|$|Charging outside, Mulder is {{attacked}} by the <b>creature</b> in the hall. When he returns with the welts all over his throat, George Vincent slams the door and takes them all hostage, leaving Mulder {{to die in the}} hallway. Angela goes into labor and Scully finds herself forced to deliver a baby. However, water collects in the light fixture above them and the <b>creature</b> appears. It grabs George Vincent by the neck. Scully tells Walter Suarez to aim for the sprinklers, realizing that the freshwater kept the <b>creature</b> at bay, as with the deputy until Epsom salt was added to the water. Suarez shoots the sprinklers and saves Vincent's life. Meanwhile, Mulder realizes that freshwater is the key also, and runs out into the rain to heal his wounds.|$|E

5|$|Doggett {{goes off}} alone {{to see the}} woman who guarded the <b>creature</b> in the woods. The woman implies that Mulder, feeling sorry for the <b>creature,</b> was trying to euthanize the <b>creature,</b> not save Hangemuhl. Doggett hears a noise and finds a trap door leading into the tunnels. Underground, he finds Hangemuhl and takes her to the hospital. Skinner checks in with Doggett who reports that Hangemuhl's kidneys have healed spontaneously. Doggett returns to {{the woman in the}} woods who watches over the creature; after {{recoiling}} at its ugliness, the woman explains that it looks the way it does because it takes the sickness of others into itself, while healing them in the process. Doggett decides to take the <b>creature</b> away from the society, which only uses it. However, Doggett is shot and killed in a scuffle with the sheriff and is promptly buried. Later, Doggett awakens in the tunnels. In the dark corner of the cavern, the woman kneels beside the dead soul eater. She weeps over it, revealing that, by eating Doggett's death, it has finally been allowed to die.|$|E
50|$|Impossible <b>Creatures</b> was {{followed}} up later by a free downloadable expansion entitled Insect Invasion which added new <b>creatures</b> and abilities to the game.

In a startling coup—since Thalamus were associated with a rival magazine—Commodore Format (Future Publishing) secured the rights to serialise {{the development of the}} game, which again proved very popular. <b>Creatures</b> II was received favorably by the critics. <b>Creatures</b> II focused more on the popular torture screens than on the side-scrolling platforming of <b>Creatures.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{artificial evolution}} {{in a system}} that combines physical simulation with competition between <b>creatures.</b> The simulated <b>creatures</b> are constructed using point masses that are connected by oscillating springs. The <b>creatures</b> pull themselves across their 2 D environment by varying the amount of friction at different point masses, giving them sticky feet. <b>Creatures</b> combat one another, and the victor of such an encounter earns the right to reproduce, possibly with mutation. Rather than testing one individual against another in pairs, as many as 100 <b>creatures</b> move and interact with each other in the same 2 D environment. Over time, the initial <b>creatures</b> are replaced by new <b>creatures</b> that are more agile and better at combating others. The evolved <b>creatures</b> from such simulations exhibit a wide array of body plans, locomotion styles, and interaction behaviors...|$|R
5|$|Ged flies back to Ogion on Gont, who crafts a new {{staff for}} him. Contrary to Gensher, Ogion insists that all creatures have a name, and advises Ged {{to confront the}} shadow <b>creature.</b> Ged pursues the <b>creature</b> in a small sailboat, until it lures him into a fog and wrecks the boat on a reef. Ged recovers {{with the help of}} an elderly couple marooned on the island, who give Ged part of a broken {{bracelet}} as a gift. Ged patches his boat and escapes the island, pursuing the <b>creature</b> into the East Reach. On the island of Iffish he meets his friend Vetch, who insists on joining him. They journey east far beyond the last known lands before they finally come upon the shadow. Here Ged realizes that the shadow has always been a part of his own spirit. Naming it with his own name, he merges with the shadow <b>creature,</b> understanding and accepting it as part of himself, and thus healing himself.|$|E
5|$|In Flow, {{the player}} guides a small, multi-segmented worm- or snake-like <b>creature</b> through an aquatic environment. There are no menus or guidelines; the game begins immediately. The game world, which is viewed from a {{top-down}} perspective, consists of two-dimensional planes stacked vertically upon each other. A blurred {{version of the}} layer below appears {{in the background of}} each plane. Planes contain organisms of varying sizes; the player's <b>creature</b> automatically attempts to consume them when they are nearby. The majority of these creatures are non-confrontational, and are composed of cells that increase the number of segments in the player's <b>creature</b> when eaten. All planes, except for the highest and lowest, contain two specially colored organisms that move the player's <b>creature</b> up or down one plane when touched.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, the TARDIS materialises in the 17th century {{on board}} a pirate ship whose crew is being terrorised by a Siren-like <b>creature.</b> After {{receiving}} an injury, however minor, a black spot appears on their palms and then the <b>creature</b> apparently disintegrates them.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a system that}} simulates and evolves virtual <b>creatures.</b> The virtual <b>creatures</b> exist in a simulated 3 D world that has similar properties to the real world. Each <b>creature's</b> fitness is evaluated for distance traveled or jump height. The <b>creatures</b> with the highest fitness produce o spring {{for a new generation}} of <b>creatures</b> to be evaluated. Iterating this approach dozens or hundreds of times times mimics Darwinian evolution. Using modern approaches for multithreading the simulation can scale to a large number of cores with little overhead. We present how we utilize modern hardware and off-the-shelf software libraries to simulate up to a million <b>creatures</b> per hour on a consumer level quad core machine. We present the artificial DNA used to create the <b>creatures,</b> their neural network and how it is used to mutate the <b>creatures.</b> To evolve the <b>creatures</b> we also describe the different breeding and selection techniques used.
