Nevertheless, a paper from Fleischmann, in which removal of mercury in amalgam-related illness had led to complete recovery, supported his idea. (Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift 1928, No. 8).

40|$|All {{types of}} dental {{amalgams}} contain mercury, which partly is emitted as mercury vapor. All types of dental amalgams corrode after {{being placed in}} the oral cavity. Modern high <b>copper</b> <b>amalgams</b> exhibit two new traits of increased instability. Firstly, when subjected to wear/polishing, droplets rich in mercury are formed on the surface, showing that mercury is not being strongly bonded to the base or alloy metals. Secondly, high <b>copper</b> <b>amalgams</b> emit substantially larger amounts of mercury vapor than the low <b>copper</b> <b>amalgams</b> used before the 1970 s. High <b>copper</b> <b>amalgams</b> has been developed with focus on mechanical strength and corrosion resistance, but has been sub-optimized in other aspects, resulting in increased instability and higher emission of mercury vapor. This has not been presented to policy makers and scientists. Both low and high <b>copper</b> <b>amalgams</b> undergo a transformation process for several years after placement, resulting in a substantial reduction in mercury content, but there exist no limit for maximum allowed emission of mercury from dental amalgams.

X-ray diffraction studies of the amalgams revealed {{the elimination of the}} γ 2 -phase by Pd addition DSC thermogram of non-Pd containing amalgam indicated the existence of two γ 1 -phaseone with the transition temperature (endothermic peak) at 88 ◦ C and the other at 109 ◦ C. The thermogram data of the Pd containing amalgam showed an endothermic peak at 110. 7 ◦ C. The transition temperature of the n phase of the palladium containing amalgam is 4. 9 ◦ C lower than the transition temperature of the n phase of the non Pd containing amalgam. This result indicates that the n phase of the Pd containing amalgam includes more of Tin (Sn) than the non-Pd containing amalgam.

Materials and Methods: All the materials were manipulated according to the manufacturer′s recommendations and standard test specimens were prepared. A universal testing machine at different cross-head speed was used to determine all the four mechanical properties.

Results: Considerable differences in compressive strength, diametral tensile strength, and flexural strength were observed. Visible light cured composite showed relatively high compressive strength, diametral tensile strength, and flexural strength compared with the other tested materials. Amalgam showed the highest value for elastic modulus. Silver cermet showed less value for all the properties except for elastic modulus.

40|$|Abstract Background Dental assistants {{help the}} dentist in {{preparing}} material for filling teeth. Amalgam was the filling material mostly {{commonly used in}} Norway before 1980, and declined to about 5 % of all fillings in 2005. Amalgam is usually an alloy of silver, copper, tin and mercury. <b>Copper</b> <b>amalgam,</b> giving particularly high exposure to mercury was used in Norway until 1994. Metallic mercury is neurotoxic. Few studies of the health of dental assistants exist, despite their exposure to mercury. There are questions {{about the existence of}} possible chronic neurological symptoms today within this working group, due to this exposure. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the occurrence of neurological symptoms among dental assistants likely to be exposed to mercury from work with dental filling material, compared to similar health personnel with no such exposure. Methods All dental assistants still at work and born before 1970 registered in the archives of a trade union in Hordaland county of Norway were invited to participate (response rate 68 %, n = 41), as well as a similar number of randomly selected assistant nurses (response rate 87 %, n = 64) in the same age group. The participants completed a self-administered, mailed questionnaire, with questions about demographic variables, life-style factors, musculoskeletal, neurological and psychosomatic symptoms (Euroquest). Results The dental assistants reported significant higher occurrence of neurological symptoms; psychosomatic symptoms, problems with memory, concentration, fatigue and sleep disturbance, but not for mood. This was found by analyses of variance, adjusting for age, education, alcohol consumption, smoking and personality traits. For each specific neurological symptom, adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed, showing that these symptoms were mainly from arms, hands, legs and balance organs. Conclusion There is a possibility that the higher occurrence of neurological symptoms among the dental assistants may be related to their previous work exposure to mercury amalgam fillings. This should be studied further to assess the clinical importance of the reported symptoms. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{research}} is to investigate the effect of copper on compressive strength of dental amalgam. For this purpose amalgam capsules with two different content of copper were used. Cylindrical samples with diameter to height ratio 1 to 2, were prepared via molding method. To evaluate the role of copper element on compressive strength, com-pression test was done at different strain rates i. e. 0. 02, 0. 2, 0. 4 and 2 min– 1. The results and microscopic evaluations showed that an increase in <b>copper</b> content in <b>amalgam</b> caused to eliminate gamma 2 phase and leaded to promote compressive strength...|$|R
40|$|Dental amalgam {{consists}} of approximately equal parts mixture of metallic mercury and an alloy powder consisting of silver, tin, <b>copper</b> and zinc. <b>Amalgam</b> {{has been used}} extensively as a tooth filling material, accounting for 75 % of posterior restorations. The waste material from dental offices generated during restorative dental procedures contains amalgam. The uncontrolled discharge of this waste into the sewer system from {{a large number of}} dental units (i. e. dental clinics), will increase the mercury load to treatment facilities and could eventually contribute higher potential mercury exposure as well. The main objective of this project was to characterize the properties of the dental waste (DW) stream. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
40|$|Antimony film {{electrode}} was {{studied for}} the use in a voltammetric analysis of organic compounds. The substance chosen as an analyte was trifluralin, which {{is used as a}} pesticide. The comparison of different substrate electrodes was carried out between five electrodes, which were gold, silver, <b>copper,</b> polished <b>amalgam</b> and glassy carbon electrode (GCE). Best performance was observed on antimony film glassy carbon electrode (SbFGCE). It provided higher sensitivity and lower limit of quantification in comparison with bare GCE. The antimony film was stable and it provided good reproducibility (RSD = 5. 2 %). Parameters of an electrochemical preparation of SbFGCE were optimized. Conditions for determination of concentration of trifluralin were optimized on newly prepared SbFGCE. The best conditions were in a solution of methanol and 0. 1 M hydrochloric acid in 1 : 1 ratio measured by differential pulse voltammetry. The limit of quantification was determined as 1. 2 · 10 - 6 mol·l- 1. A direct voltammetric measurement on SbFGCE was carried out in a model river sample. Lower limits of quantification were achieved with solid phase extraction (SPE). Recovery values were 86 ± 8 % in deionized water with a preconcentration factor of 125. The limit of quantification was lowered to value 1. 1 · 10 - 8 mol·l- 1. The extraction [...] ...|$|R
