40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the {{benefits}} of an exercise program on functional <b>capacity</b> and <b>balance</b> <b>in</b> elderly community. A longitudinal study was conducted with 11 female subjects with mean age 77 (SD = 13) years. All individuals were evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the study by ‘Berg’ Balance Scale and ‘Timed Up and Go’ Test. Initially, the participants answered a questionnaire about the socio-demographics aspects, health conditions, falls and physical activity practice. Then, the subjects were submitted to a program of exercises for balance, strengthening and stretching muscles. The results of the ‘Berg’ Scale ranged from 46 to 56 points before the intervention, and from 50 to 56, after the intervention (p = 0. 01). Individuals older than 75 years old had a better improvement (p = 0. 04). In the ‘Timed Up and Go’ Test the percentage of improvement was 8. 2 % (= 13. 1; SD= 11. 7).

40|$|Background: the Berg {{scale and}} the timed 'up and go' test (TUG) are {{established}} measures to assess mobility in frail older adults. As an alternative to self-paced tests to assess aerobic exercise capacity, the incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) was developed. We hypothesized that ISWT may be useful {{for the assessment of}} aerobic <b>capacity</b> and <b>balance</b> simultaneously <b>in</b> healthy adults. Objectives: There are 3 objectives: (1) to evaluate the intra-tester reliability of TUG in healthy subjects; (2) to compare the validity of TUG, ISWT and comfortable gait speed (GS) to evaluate balance assessed by the Berg balance scale, and (3) to evaluate the correlations among these walking tests. Methods: We studied a sample of 64 subjects (82. 81 % women) aged 40 - 84 years to assess the intra-tester reliability of TUG. of these, 21 subjects also performed ISWT, GS and the Berg balance scale. We also assessed height, weight, body mass index, spirometry and reported physical activity. Results: the average time to complete TUG was 7. 23 +/- 1. 27 s. the interclass correlation coefficient of TUG was excellent (0. 936; 95 % CI: 0. 895 - 0. 961). Age (r = 0. 36), GS (r = - 0. 64), GS/height (r = - 0. 44), ISWT (r = - 0. 65) and the Berg score (r = - 0. 65) were correlated with TUG (p < 0. 05). the Berg score was significantly (p < 0. 05) correlated with GS (r = 0. 61) and ISWT (r = 0. 61). Moreover, ISWT was mutually related with GS (r = 0. 68). We evaluated 2 models of linear regression, using GS and TUG as independent variables in each of them. in the 1 st model, GS described 47 % of the ISWT variability. in the 2 nd, TUG described 42. 7 % of the ISWT variability. Conclusions: the capacity of walking is related to <b>balance</b> <b>in</b> healthy adults and seniors. Our results suggest the usefulness of ISWT as a new tool for the simultaneous evaluation of the aerobic <b>capacity</b> and <b>balance</b> <b>in</b> healthy subjects. An important part of the ISWT variation was explained by GS and TUG. Secondly, we confirmed the significant influence of age in the TUG performance and the excellent reliability of this field walking test. Copyright (C) 2010 S.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess quality of life, muscle strength, <b>balance</b> and physical <b>capacity</b> among elderly practitioners and non-practitioners of physical activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional study was carried out involving 74 elderly individuals in the city of Santos (state of São Paulo, Brazil), divided into two groups: practitioners and non-practitioners of physical activity. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used for the classification of the participants. The generic SF- 36 questionnaire was used to assess quality of life. The Berg scale was used for the analysis of balance. Dynamometry was used for the muscle strength test. The six-minute walk test was used for the assessment of physical capacity. RESULTS: Significant differences were found between elderly practitioners and non-practitioners of physical activity regarding quality of life (p = 0. 001), muscle strength (p = 0. 001), balance (p = 0. 001) and physical capacity (p = 0. 001). The data also showed that aspects of quality of life were strongly correlated with physical capacity among the non-practitioners of physical activity (r = 0. 741).

40|$|High-resolution digital {{elevation}} data (TOPSAR 10 -m grid) {{are used to}} reconstruct Late Quaternary growth histories of subtle folding in the Wairarapa fold-and-thrust belt, North Island, New Zealand. Outcrop data of deformed latest Miocene and younger strata are combined with observations of warped and faulted late Quaternary terrace surfaces to unravel the geomorphic and structural history of the Huangarua River valley. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of loess that accumulated on these strath terraces and paleosol stratigraphy allow temporal correlation among the terraces and with glacial climate cycles since the Last Interglaciation. These data indicate that five intervals of strath cutting occurred, at f 125, 60 – 70, f 30, f 15, and < 10 ka. Strath beveling is largely independent of local folding or regional base-level change. We hypothesize that straths are cut when an increase in sediment supply, during cool climatic periods, brings river sediment load and river transport <b>capacity</b> into <b>balance.</b> <b>In</b> the Wairarapa, strath-cutting events appear to occur {{near the end of}} cool climatic cycles. This study shows that the identification of subtle departures from regional topographic trends becomes practical when a high-resolution DEM is available. After subtraction of an average valley gradient from the digital topography, the residual topography on the terrace treads reveals cross-valley and longitudinal tilting. Although rates of folding are slow and the magnitude of deformation is commonly limited to less than a few tens of meters, these topographic anomalies define fold axes that coincide with subsurface structures.

Furthermore, we aimed to identify which training regimen was most effective. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of exercise therapy on <b>balance</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> the chronic phase after stroke. Studies were included if they were of moderate or high methodological quality (PEDro score >/= 4). Data were pooled if a specific outcome measure was reported in at least 3 randomized controlled trials. A sensitivity analysis and consequent subgroup analyses were performed for the different types of experimental training (balance and/or weight-shifting training, gait training, multisensory training, high-intensity aerobic exercise training, and other training programs). RESULTS: Forty-three randomized controlled trials out of 369 unique hits were included. A meta-analysis could be conducted for the Berg Balance Scale (28 studies, n= 985), Functional Reach Test (5 studies, n= 153), Sensory Organization Test (4 studies, n= 173), and mean postural sway velocity (3 studies, n= 89). A significant overall difference in favor of the intervention group was found for the Berg Balance Scale (mean difference 2. 22 points (+ 3. 9 %); 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 26 - 3. 17; P< 0. 01; I(2) = 52 %), Functional Reach Test (mean difference= 3. 12 cm; 95 % CI, 0. 90 - 5. 35; P< 0. 01; I(2) = 74 %), and Sensory Organization Test (mean difference= 6. 77 (+ 7 %) points; 95 % CI, 0. 83 - 12. 7; P= 0. 03; I(2) = 0 %). Subgroup analyses of the studies that included Berg Balance Scale outcomes demonstrated a significant improvement after balance and/or weight-shifting training of 3. 75 points (+ 6. 7 %; 95 % CI, 1. 71 - 5. 78; P< 0. 01; I(2) = 52 %) and after gait training of 2. 26 points (+ 4. 0 %; 95 % CI, 0. 94 - 3. 58; P< 0. 01; I(2) = 21, whereas no significant effects were found for other training regimens.

Storage systems {{can provide the}} necessary <b>balancing</b> <b>capacities.</b> Therefore, it is analyzed which potential for flexible energy consumption {{can be found in}} private households. Heat and power in private households are heavily interlinked due to increasing numbers of electrical heating systems (e. g. heat pumps). In addition, installed PV systems on roof tops are making renewable electricity an attractive energy source for space heating and hot water supply. To maximize the consumption of self-generated electricity, battery energy storage systems (BESS) and thermal hot-water based storage systems are used in private households. The challenge is to find economically viable configurations for sizing of combined battery and thermal storage units. The introduced approach simulates a household with a variable size of the relevant components of the thermal and electric system, being the PV system, PV and battery converters (DC linked), the battery (lithium-ion), thermal hot water storage and a heat pump. Profiles for the electrical load are based on empirical analysis of resident behavior coupled with measurements from typical household appliances. The thermal load profiles are derived from representative simulation tools, simulating resident behavior and the resulting heat demand. Based on the simulation results, an optimal sizing of storage units is calculated...|$|R

40|$|Aging {{is often}} {{accompanied}} by decreased muscle strength, aerobic <b>capacity</b> and <b>balance,</b> {{which can lead to}} impaired physical performance. Epidemiological data have demonstrated that low levels of physical activity are strongly related to functional decline. Frailty has been defined as a clinical syndrome comprised of unintentional body weight loss, self-reported exhaustion, muscle weakness, slow walking speed and a low level of physical activity in men and women over the age of 65. There is contradictory evidence regarding the effects of physical training on physical performance in frail elderly people. The primary aim of this thesis is to describe the effects of physical training on physical performance i. e. muscle strength, aerobic <b>capacity,</b> <b>balance,</b> mobility and physical activity level as well as activities of daily living (ADL) and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in frail elderly people. Another aim is to investigate reliability with test re-test in one repetition maximum (1 RM) in the arm/shoulder. Ninety-six community-dwelling elderly people (58 women) were randomised to four different groups: i) physical training programme (aerobic, muscle strength, balance), ii) a nutritional intervention programme (individually targeted nutritional advice and group sessions), iii) a combination of these interventions and iv) a control group. At baseline the subjects were screened for physical performance as well as nutrition related variables. These measurements were repeated immediately after the intervention, which lasted for 12 weeks, and again six months later. During the last six months, the subjects in the training groups were encouraged to perform homebased exercises and to fill in training diaries. Two years after baseline, a third followup regarding ADL was conducted through telephone calls. The test re-test procedure with 1 RM was conducted at one week-interval, comparing the reliability between test sessions, and also between subjects with or without previous muscle strength training experience. A positive effect of the physical training programme was shown on leg muscle strength and habitual physical activity level for frail elderly people. Adding a nutritional intervention did not affect the results. There were no other significant differences between groups. Subjects with improvements <b>in</b> muscle strength, <b>balance</b> and mobility had significantly higher compliance compared to non-improvers. There were moderate significant correlations between compliance of the home-based exercises and improvements in personal ADL and HRQL. There was a high correlation between the test sessions in 1 RM, r= 0. 97 for both groups. An analysis of 95 % limits of agreement for the mean difference was - 4. 3 /+ 6. 9 kg for the group without and - 3. 0 /+ 6. 4 kg for the group with previous muscle strength training experience, respectively. In conclusion, the physical training programme showed a positive effect on leg muscle strength and habitual physical activity level. An individually tailored intervention is probably necessary to achieve a positive result on physical performance such as aerobic <b>capacity,</b> <b>balance</b> and mobility <b>in</b> frail elderly people. 1 RM seems to be a reliable and safe method for dosing the intensity and evaluating a muscle strength training programme for elderly people...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: Visual {{system has}} a major role <b>in</b> <b>balance</b> control and {{provides}} information about the position of body and head in relation to surrounding objects and in the space. One of the health problems, especially in developing countries, is {{the high incidence of}} low vision in different age groups (3. 1 %). The visual deficit in these patients may affect their balance during daily activities which usually involve concomitant tasks such as walking and speaking. Therefore, the effect of concurrent cognitive activity on the postural control of patients with low vision was investigated. Materials and Methods: twenty low vision volunteers (age 32 ± 5, weight 71 ± 17 kg, height 167 ± 14 cm) and twenty normal subjects (age 33 ± 4, weight: 72 ± 14 kg, height: 170 ± 9 cm) were recruited in this study. The dynamic stability score was evaluated by Stabilometer (Biodex, England) in three different standing positions (eyes open, eyes closed and eyes open with a cognitive task). Lower stability score represents better stability. Results: The stability score in open eyes condition with or without dual task in normal group was lower than low vision group (P= 0. 04). However, in closed eyes condition, it was lower in low vision group compared to normal group (P= 0. 03). Dual task resulted in increase in the stability score in both groups; however, the changes were only significant in low visions (P= 0. 04). Conclusion: The results represent the higher reliance of normal subjects to visual inputs for balance control. The decreased <b>balance</b> control <b>in</b> low vision groups during dual task suggests the higher usage of their limited central integration <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> <b>balance</b> control. This may predispose this group of patients to falling accidents during daily activities which may involve several concomitant tasks...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To analyze how the neuromuscular {{ability to}} produce force (maximal {{isotonic}} and explosive force), by lower limb and back muscles, contributes to explain the <b>balance</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> healthy elders. The analysis considers the age and gender of the participants. Material and Method: one hundred and thirteen healthy older participated {{in the present study}} were common physical test were instrumentalized (lumbar extension, functional reach test and get up and go test) to measure maximal force and balance. The analysis was developed considering gender and age of the participants. Results: considering the age and gender of the participants, it could argue that older people show different responses to the same stimuli, providing higher performance by younger men and lower performance by older women. Furthermore, significant correlations were found between variables and the ability to perform functional task and neuromuscular force test between 0. 497 and 0. 811 for women subgroup and between 0. 416 and 0. 833 for men subgroup. Conclusions: There are two negative conditions that affect the performance of functional tasks that analyze the strength or balance of people: Gender, the yield in less women than men, and age where older elderly showed lower performance on the tasks requested. © 2015, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid y CV Ciencias del Deporte.

40|$|Abstract Objective {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to assess whether reduced <b>balance</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> obese {{subjects}} is secondary to altered sensory information. Design cross sectional study. Subjects 44 obese (BMI = 40. 6 ± 4. 6 kg/m 2, age = 34. 2 ± 10. 8 years, body weight: 114, 0 ± 16, 0 Kg, body height 167, 5 ± 9, 8 cm) and 20 healthy controls (10 females, 10 males, BMI: 21. 6 ± 2. 2 kg/m 2, age: 30. 5 ± 5. 5 years, body weight: 62, 9 ± 9, 3 Kg, body height 170, 1 ± 5, 8 cm) were enrolled. Measurements center of pressure (CoP) displacements were evaluated during quiet stance on a force platform with eyes open (EO) and closed (EC). The Romberg quotient (EC/EO) was computed and compared between groups. Results we found statistically significant differences between obese and controls in CoP displacements (p 0. 08). Conclusion the increased CoP displacements in obese subjects do not need an hypothesis about altered sensory information. The integration of different sensory inputs appears similar in controls and obese. In the latter, the increased mass, ankle torque and muscle activity may probably account for the higher CoP displacements. </p...|$|R
40|$|Impaled {{cells of}} Valonia were <b>balanced</b> <b>in</b> a Wheatstone bridge against a simple series-parallel circuit of two {{resistances}} and a capacity, the transient charge and discharge curves at {{make and break}} of direct current being recorded with a string galvanometer. With the resistances properly balanced, a series of characteristic deflections resulted when the <b>balancing</b> <b>capacity</b> was varied. With many cells, no complete <b>capacity</b> <b>balance</b> was ever attained over the entire transient time course; but instead either a monophasic or diphasic residual deflection always remained. This behavior is {{comparable to that of}} a polarizing electrode in D. C., although not so clearly marked; and it is concluded that Valonia usually has an appreciable polarization component, probably in parallel with a static capacity. However, some cells can be balanced almost completely against a mica condenser of proper value, which indicates that they display a nearly pure static capacity under some conditions. This static state could be produced experimentally by exposure to weak acids (acetic, carbonic, etc.) and by metabolic agents probably inducing internal acidity (low oxygen tension, long exposure to cold, narcotics, etc.). Conversely, penetrating weak bases, such as ammonia, abolished the static capacity, or even any regular polarization. Light acts something like ammonia, after an initial "acid gush" anomaly. Most of these agents likewise affect the P. D. and its response to external ionic alterations, and {{it seems likely that the}} change in capacity type reflects altered ionic permeabilities and relative mobilities...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the {{benefits}} of an exercise program on functional <b>capacity</b> and <b>balance</b> <b>in</b> elderly community. A longitudinal study was conducted with 11 female subjects with mean age 77 (SD = 13) years. All individuals were evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the study by ‘Berg’ Balance Scale and ‘Timed Up and Go’ Test. Initially, the participants answered a questionnaire about the socio-demographics aspects, health conditions, falls and physical activity practice. Then, the subjects were submitted to a program of exercises for balance, strengthening and stretching muscles. The results of the ‘Berg’ Scale ranged from 46 to 56 points before the intervention, and from 50 to 56, after the intervention (p = 0. 01). Individuals older than 75 years old had a better improvement (p = 0. 04). In the ‘Timed Up and Go’ Test the percentage of improvement was 8. 2 % (= 13. 1; SD= 11. 7). The exercise program showed a positive effect in improving risk factors of falls in the elderly community.
