40|$|We {{describe}} a new method for superresolution of still images (in the wavelet domain) {{based on the}} reconstruction of missing details subbands pixels at a given ith level via Rule of Three (Ro 3) between pixels of approximation subband of such level, and pixels of approximation and detail subbands of (i+ 1) th level. The histogramic profiles demonstrate that Ro 3 is the appropriate mechanism to recover missing detail subband pixels in these cases. Besides, with {{the elimination of the}} details subbands pixels (in an eventual compression scheme), we obtain a bigger compression rate. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach compares favorably to more typical methods of denoising and compression in wavelet domain.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the synchronization problem for networks of coupled nonlinear dynamical systems under switching communication topologies. Two types of nonlinear agent dynamics are considered. The {{first one is}} non-expansive dynamics (stable dynamics with a convex Lyapunov function φ(·)) and the second one is dynamics that satisfies a global Lipschitz condition. For the non-expansive case, we show that various forms of joint connectivity for communication graphs are sufficient for networks to achieve global asymptotic φ-synchronization. We also show that φ-synchronization leads to state synchronization provided that certain additional conditions are satisfied. For the globally Lipschitz case, unlike the non-expansive <b>case,</b> <b>joint</b> connectivity alone is not sufficient for achieving synchronization. A sufficient condition for reaching global exponential synchronization is established {{in terms of the}} relationship between the global Lipschitz constant and the network parameters. We also extend the results to leader-follower networks. Comment: 27 pages, 0 figure...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{considers}} non-parametric {{maximum likelihood}} {{estimation of the}} failure time distribution for interval censored data subject to misclassification. Such data can arise from two types of observation scheme; either where observations continue until the first positive test result or where tests continue regardless of the test results. In the former case, the misclassification probabilities must be known, whereas in the latter <b>case</b> <b>joint</b> estimation of the event-time distribution and misclassification probabilities is possible. The regions for which the maximum likelihood estimate can only have support are derived. Algorithms for computing the maximum likelihood estimate are investigated and it is shown that algorithms appropriate for computing non-parametric mixing distributions perform better than an iterative convex minorant algorithm {{in terms of time}} to absolute convergence. A profile likelihood approach is proposed for joint estimation. The methods are illustrated on a data set relating to the onset of cardiac allograft vasculopathy in post-heart-transplantation patients...|$|E
3000|$|If {{the number}} of antenna {{elements}} implemented in a user terminal {{is more than the}} total number of the desired and interference signals, it is possible to separate the desired signal and the other interfering signals by a normal multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection process. In this case, simple linear detection schemes such as a zero-forcing detection scheme or a minimum mean-square-error detection scheme can be applied. However, owing to the limitation of its form factor, {{the number of}} receive antennas may be less than the number of received signal streams. This is an “overloaded" [...] situation, and a nonlinear detection scheme must be applied in the receiver. The joint detection of multiple signal streams in the receiver is a solution to this limitation although joint detection increases the demodulation complexity [18]. Joint detection only requires the channel responses and modulation orders of the interfering signals. In [19], the effect of joint detection in terminals both near and far from a base station located {{at the center of a}} cell was investigated. In this <b>case,</b> <b>joint</b> detection works effectively in cell site terminals. In a heterogeneous network, joint detection works effectively in the cell site terminals of a pico cell as they suffer from large interference from a MBS.|$|E

40|$|Adjuvant {{arthritis}} in rats is {{induced by}} a T cell clone specific for amino acids 180 - 188 of the mycobacterial 65 -kD heat-shock protein, and synovial T cell {{responses to this}} same Ag have been noted in human arthritis. We have isolated 65 -kD Ag-specific T cell clones from synovial fluid mononuclear cells of a patient with acute arthritis, which, unlike the corresponding PBMC, showed a marked proliferative response to the 65 -kD Ag. Using synthetic peptides corresponding to the whole sequence of the 65 -kD Ag, all the clones were shown to recognize an epitope present in the first NH 2 -terminal peptide (amino acids 1 - 15), with no response to the adjacent peptide (amino acids 6 - 22) or to any other peptide. The complete dominance of this epitope in {{the response to the}} 65 -kD Ag was shown by documenting responses to the peptide in PBMC obtained after recovery from the arthritis. This epitope, like that recognized by the rat arthritogenic T cell clone, is in a portion of the 65 -kD sequence that is not conserved between bacteria and eukaryotes, so that in this <b>case,</b> <b>joint</b> inflammation could not be attributed to bacteria-induced T cell clones cross-reacting with the self 65 -kD Ag...|$|E
40|$|A primary {{objective}} of the technical evaluation motor program is to recover the case, igniter and nozzle hardware for use on the redesigned solid rocket motor flight program. Two qualification objectives were addressed and met on TEM- 3. The Nylok thread locking device of the 1 U 100269 - 03 leak check port plug and the 1 U 52295 - 04 safe and arm utilizing Krytox grease on the barrier-booster shaft O-rings were both certified. All inspection and instrumentation data indicate that the TEM- 3 static test firing conducted 23 May 1989 was successful. The test was conducted at ambient conditions {{with the exception of}} the field joints (set point of 121 F, with a minimum of 87 F at the sensors), igniter joint (set point at 122 F with a minimum of 87 F at sensors) and case-to-nozzle joint (set point at 114 F with a minimum of 87 F at sensors). Ballistics performance values were within specification requirements. Nozzle performance was nominal with typical erosion. The nozzle and the <b>case</b> <b>joint</b> temperatures were maintained at the heaters controlling set points while electrical power was supplied.
