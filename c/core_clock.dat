The BeagleBoard-xM measures in at 82.55 by 82.55 mm and has a faster CPU <b>core</b> (<b>clocked</b> at 1 GHz compared to the 720 MHz of the BeagleBoard), more RAM (512 MB compared to 256 MB), onboard Ethernet jack, and 4 port USB hub.

The addition of the Camera port to the -xM provides a simple way of importing video via Leopard Board cameras.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} {{an approach}} to analyze the power and energy consumption of a many-core system. The investigation {{has been done by}} using the Intel SCC system as an experimental platform. The approach is to collect the time and power profiling of an executing application on the Intel SCC system. And then, we find the total energy consumed for the entire execution. We studied the effects of power and energy consumption in many-core systems by varying different hardware configuration parameters such as number of <b>cores,</b> <b>clock</b> frequency and voltage level. Thus, the many-core system can be explored for its scalability, fitness in operational cost and performance. ...|$|R
