40|$|In this study, {{effects of}} {{geometric}} factors and material properties are investigated on stress behavior of <b>circular</b> <b>rotating</b> disk with constant rotation in various industrial mechanisms using equilibrium equations, geometric relations and stress functions. In this way, research on a thin uniform and homogeneous circular disk under constant rotation is considered. The rotating motion produces centrifugal acceleration on each {{element of the}} rotating disk, and this rotating motion be-comes the source of external loading for the mentioned problem. Additional exterior loadings are not assumed in this problem. It is comfortable to handle the centrifugal force loading by relating it to a body force density via the disk {{in order to increase}} strength (maximum stress) of <b>circular</b> <b>rotating</b> disk. Eventually, stress behavior of rotating disk is analyzed with considering geometric factors and material properties analytically. Finally, it is concluded that the mentioned factors affect on increasing and decreasing stress values of <b>circular</b> <b>rotating</b> disk under constant rotation...|$|R

40|$|We compute {{higher order}} finite size {{corrections}} to the energies of the <b>circular</b> <b>rotating</b> string on AdS_ 5 x S^ 5, of its orbifolded generalization on AdS_ 5 x S^ 5 /Z_M {{and of the}} winding state which is obtained as the limit of the orbifolded circular string solution when J -> infinity and J/M^ 2 is kept fixed. We solve, at the first order in lambda'=lambda/J^ 2, where lambda is the 't Hooft coupling, the Bethe equations that describe the anomalous dimensions of the corresponding gauge dual operators in an expansion in m/K, where m is the winding number and K is the "magnon number", and to all orders in the angular momentum J. The solution for the <b>circular</b> <b>rotating</b> string and for the winding state can be matched to the energy computed from an effective quantum Landau-Lifshitz model beyond the first order correction in 1 /J. For the leading 1 /J corrections to the <b>circular</b> <b>rotating</b> string in m^ 2 and m^ 4 and for the subleading 1 /J^ 2 corrections to the m^ 2 term, we find agreement. For the winding state we match the energy completely up to, and including, the order 1 /J^ 2 finite-size corrections. The solution of the Bethe equations corresponding to the spinning closed string is also provided in an expansion in m/K and to all orders in J.

40|$|Experimental {{results for}} the {{collapse}} of granular columns on a <b>rotating</b> <b>table</b> are presented. In the non-rotating case two flow regimes are exhibited dependent on the aspect ratio a = h 0 /r 0, where h 0 is the initial height and r 0 is the initial column radius. Scaling relations for the characteristic geometrical properties of the collapsed column under varying rotation rates are obtained. As the rotation rate increases, material is lost from the main pile and travels {{to the edge of}} the <b>rotating</b> <b>table.</b> This results in a decrease in the final radius of the main collapsed pile, as material is lost during this secondary, rotation-induced spreading phase. The degree of mass ejection in the secondary spread increases with rotation frequency for a given initial aspect ratio.
