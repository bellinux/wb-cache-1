40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} cross-linguistic {{investigation into the}} grammatical structure of complement clauses {{and the organization of}} <b>complementation</b> <b>systems.</b> Based on a balanced sample of 100 widely dispersed languages, the major goals of the present work are to set the two landmark typological reference articles on complementation (Noonan 1985 | 2007, Dixon 2006) onto a broad empirical basis and to explore hitherto understudied phenomena in the constitution of <b>complementation</b> <b>systems.</b> In particular, the traditional focus on object complement clauses is shifted to complements in ‘subject’ function, and the dissertation is the first to analyse systematically the cross-linguistic productivity, morphosyntactic coding, syntagmatic arrangement and diachronic rise of complements in S- and A-function, as compared to their corresponding object clauses. On a methodological plane, it combines a multivariate approach to clause-linkage with recent statistical techniques of data mining (e. g. HCFA, cluster analyses, NeighborNet, MDS) in order to measure (dis) similarities in the cross-linguistic organization of complementation constructions. This comprises, for example, a precise gauging {{of the degree to which}} the internal structure of complements is ‘desententialized’ (Lehmann 1988) and made NP-like, of the ways in which this correlates with the possible external functions and positions of the complement in the main clause, and of the ways in which these distributional patterns in <b>complementation</b> <b>systems</b> reflect the historical origins and lexical diffusion of the relevant constructions. Above all, the dissertation problematizes the conceptual and terminological foundations for the typological study of complementation, which, despite decades of intensive research, remain challenging to establish in a cross-linguistically satisfactory way...|$|R

Contrary to the case in Standard Turkish, nominalizing suffixes are employed only when selecting (matrix) predicates are non-factive veridical ones. Non-veridical predicates, on the other hand, select subordinate clauses that are in optative mood, a preexisting Turkish pattern which has nevertheless been reinforced by Cretan Greek impact.

40|$|Meiotic {{homologous}} recombination (HR) {{is important for}} proper chromosomal segregation during gametogenesis and facilitates evolutionary adaptation via genomic reshuffling. In most eukaryotes, HR is mediated by two recombinases, the ubiquitous RAD 51 and the meiosis-specific DMC 1. The role of RAD 51 in mammalian meiosis is unclear and study of its function is limited due to embryonic lethality of RAD 51 knockouts. Here, we developed an in vivo meiotic knockdown and protein <b>complementation</b> <b>system</b> to study RAD 51 during mouse spermatogenesis. We show that RAD 51 is crucial during meiotic prophase and its loss leads to depletion of late prophase I spermatocytes through a p 53 -dependent apoptotic pathway. This phenotype is distinct from that observed in the DMC 1 knockdown. Our meiotic knockdown and <b>complementation</b> <b>system</b> establishes an experimental platform for mechanistic studies of meiotic proteins with unknown functions or essential genes for which a testis-specific knockout is not possible...|$|E

40|$|AbstractNpro fusion technology, {{a highly}} {{efficient}} system for overexpression of proteins and peptides in Escherichia coli, was further developed by splitting the autoprotease Npro into two fragments {{to generate a}} functional <b>complementation</b> <b>system.</b> The size of the expression tag is thus reduced from 168 to 58 amino acids, so by 66 %. Upon complementation of the fragments auto-proteolytic activity is restored. This process has been shown for three model proteins of different size, a short 16 aa-peptide, MCP- 1, and lysozyme. Moreover, the complementation was still functional after immobilization of the N-terminal fragment to a solid support which enables recycling of the immobilized fragment. This strategy enhances overall productivity of Npro Fusion Technology and thus allows more efficient production of recombinant proteins with reduced costs and in higher yields. Overall, the Npro <b>complementation</b> <b>system</b> has, {{depending on the size}} of the target molecule, potential to increase the productivity up to 4 fold for batch refolding and even more for on-column refolding strategies by the proven possibility of regeneration of the immobilized fragment...|$|E
40|$|ALKBH 2 is an Fe(II), alpha-ketoglutarate {{dependent}} dioxygenase that repairs methyl and etheno lesions. Recently, ALKBH 2 {{has been}} described as a tumor suppressor, and somatic ALKBH 2 mutations have been reported in tumors. To understand selective pressures driving ALKBH 2 evolution, we evolved an ALKBH 2 mutant library under MNNG selection, which generates methyl adducts that are not known ALKBH 2 substrates. Mutants from our selection overlap with tumor mutations. We used E. coli <b>complementation</b> <b>systems</b> to study how these mutations alter protection against both known methyl and etheno substrates, and against non-canonical cytotoxic lesions. We find that: 1) ALKBH 2 mutant activity against known substrates is decreased but not abolished 2) Activity against methyl adducts can be differentially modulated relative to etheno adducts. 3) Some of our MNNG-selected mutations exhibit protection to additional cytotoxic lesions. These findings open the door for genetic modulation of ALKBH 2 substrate specificity, which has implications for alkylating agent therapy...|$|R

A 15 -mer peptide (S 15 p) with high affinity for S pro was selected from a phage display library. Peptide residues that are buried {{in the structure of}} the wild type complex are conserved in S 15 p though there are several changes at other positions. Isothermal titration calorimetry studies show that the affinity of S 15 p is comparable to that of the wild type peptide at 25 °C. However, the magnitudes of ΔH° and ΔCp are lower for S 15 p, suggesting that the thermal stability of the complex is enhanced. In agreement with this prediction, at pH 6, the Tm of the S 15 p complex was found to be 10 °C higher than that of the wild type complex. This suggests that for proteins where fragment <b>complementation</b> <b>systems</b> exist, phage display can be used to find mutations that increase protein thermal stability...|$|R
40|$|Human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) {{has a large}} 240 kb genome {{that may}} encode more than 700 gene products with many of them remaining uncharacterized. Mutagenesis of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) -cloned CMV genomes has greatly facilitated the analysis of viral gene functions. However, the roles of essential proteins often remain particularly elusive because their investigation requires the cumbersome establishment of suitable <b>complementation</b> <b>systems.</b> Here, we show that HCMV genomes can be introduced into cells with unprecedented efficiency by applying a transfection protocol based on replication-defective, inactivated adenovirus particles (adenofection). Upon adenofection of several permissive cell types with HCMV genomes carrying mutations in essential genes, transfection rates of up to 60 % were observed and viral proteins of all kinetic classes were found expressed. This enabled further analyses of the transfected cells by standard biochemical techniques. Remarkably, HCMV genomes lacking elements essential for viral DNA replication, such as the lytic origin of replication, still expressed several late proteins. In conclusion, adenofection allows the study of essential HCMV genes directly in BAC-transfected cells {{without the need for}} sophisticated complementation strategies...|$|R
40|$|Background: In plants, eIF 4 E {{translation}} initiation {{factors and}} their eIFiso 4 E isoforms are essential susceptibility factors for many RNA viruses, including potyviruses. Mutations altering {{these factors are}} {{a major source of}} resistance to the viruses. The eIF 4 E allelic series is associated with specific resistance spectra in crops such as Capsicum annum. Genetic evidence shows that potyviruses have a specific requirement for a given 4 E isoform that depends on the host plant. For example, Tobacco etch virus (TEV) uses eIF 4 E 1 to infect Capsicum annuum but uses eIFiso 4 E to infect Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we investigated how TEV exploits different translation initiation factor isoforms to infect these two plant species. Results: A <b>complementation</b> <b>system</b> was set up in Arabidopsis to test the restoration of systemic infection by TEV. Using this system, Arabidopsis susceptibility to TEV was complemented with a susceptible pepper eIF 4 E 1 allele but not with a resistant allele. Therefore, in Arabidopsis, TEV can use the pepper eIF 4 E 1 instead of the endogenous eIFiso 4 E isoform so is able to switch between translation initiation factor 4 E isoform to infect the same host. Moreover, we show that overexpressing the pepper eIF 4 E 1 alleles is sufficient to make Arabidopsis susceptible to an otherwise incompatible TEV strain. Lastly, we show that the resistant eIF 4 E 1 allele is similarly overcome by a resistance-breaking TEV strain as in pepper, confirming that this Arabidopsis TEV-susceptibility <b>complementation</b> <b>system</b> is allele-specific. Conclusion: We report here a <b>complementation</b> <b>system</b> in Arabidopsis that makes it possible to assess the role of pepper pvr 2 -eIF 4 E alleles in susceptibility to TEV. Heterologous complementation experiments showed that the idiosyncratic properties of the 4 E and iso 4 E proteins create a major checkpoint for viral infection of different hosts. This system could be used to screen natural or induced eIF 4 E alleles to find and study alleles of interest for plant breedin...|$|E

NSP 2, {{one of two}} rotavirus proteins needed for viroplasm assembly, possesses NTPase, RNA-binding, and helix-unwinding activities. NSP 2 of the rotavirus group causing endemic infantile diarrhea (group A) was shown to self-assemble into large doughnut-shaped octamers with circumferential grooves and deep clefts containing nucleotide-binding histidine triad (HIT) -like motifs. Here, we demonstrate that NSP 2 of group C rotavirus, a group that fails to reassort with group A viruses, retains the unique architecture of the group A octamer but differs in surface charge distribution. By using an NSP 2 -dependent <b>complementation</b> <b>system,</b> we show that the HIT-dependent NTPase activity of NSP 2 is necessary for dsRNA synthesis, but not for viroplasm formation. The <b>complementation</b> <b>system</b> also showed that despite the retention of the octamer structure and the HIT-like fold, group C NSP 2 failed to rescue replication and viroplasm formation in NSP 2 -deficient cells infected with group A rotavirus. The distinct differences in the surface charges on the Bristol and SA 11 NSP 2 octamers suggest that charge complementarity of the viroplasm-forming proteins guides the specificity of viroplasm formation and, possibly, reassortment restriction between rotavirus groups...|$|E

The dissociation constant of these fragment pairs determined in vitro were as low as 3 nM, resulting in one of the tightest fragment <b>complementation</b> <b>systems</b> reported so far. Furthermore, we show that the affinity of fragment complementation is correlated with the stability of the uncut parent protein. Exploring this correlation, we screened a yeast two-hybrid library of one fragment and identified mutations that suppress the effect of a destabilizing mutation in the other fragment. One of the identified mutations significantly increased the stability of the uncut wild-type protein, proving that fragment complementation {{can be used as a}} novel strategy for the selection of proteins with enhanced stability...|$|R

However, relative to the research progress in model plants, far less information is available on the function of WRKY proteins in cotton. In the present study, we identified the GhWRKY 40 gene in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) and determined that the GhWRKY 40 protein is targeted to the nucleus and is a stress-inducible transcription factor. The GhWRKY 40 transcript level was increased upon wounding and infection with the bacterial pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum. The overexpression of GhWRKY 40 down-regulated most of the defense-related genes, enhanced the wounding tolerance and increased the susceptibility to R. solanacearum. Consistent with a role in multiple stress responses, we found that the GhWRKY 40 transcript level was increased by the stress hormones salicylic acid (SA), methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and ethylene (ET). Moreover, GhWRKY 40 interacted with the MAPK kinase GhMPK 20, as shown using yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence <b>complementation</b> <b>systems.</b> Collectively, these results suggest that GhWRKY 40 is regulated by SA, MeJA and ET signaling and coordinates responses to wounding and R. solanacearum attack.

This system also allowed us to partially characterize the function of each of the gene products in the production and transport of hemolysin. Taken with previously published data, the present experiments indicate the following.

(iii) Normal amounts of hemolysin activity inactive precursor of hemolysin. (iii) Normal amounts of hemolysin activity require only the products of hlyA and hlyC. This activity was found in the periplasm; very little hemolysin activity was found in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the hlyC product is required for transport or activation of the hlyA product or both. (iv) Active hemolysin remains in the periplasm in the absence of hlyB function, hence the hlyB product seems to be necessary for the transport of hemolysin to the exterior of the cell.

Here, we have employed <b>complementation</b> <b>systems</b> to examine the role that HCV polyprotein precursors play in RNA replication and virion assembly. In a trans-complementation assay, a HCV NS 3 - 5 A polyprotein precursor was required to facilitate efficient complementation of a replication-defective mutation in NS 5 A. However, this requirement for precursor expression was partially alleviated when a second functional copy of NS 5 A was expressed from an additional upstream cistron within the RNA to be rescued. In contrast, rescue of a virion assembly mutation in NS 5 A was more limited but exhibited little or no requirement for expression of functional NS 5 A as a precursor, even when produced {{in the context of}} second replicating helper RNA. Furthermore, expression of NS 5 A alone from an additional cistron within a replicon construct gave greater rescue of virion assembly in cis as compared to in trans.

In this chemical <b>complementation</b> <b>system,</b> the interaction of a nuclear receptor and a ligand is essential for yeast survival. In first generation chemical complementation, a two-component assay was developed where the Gal 4 DNA-binding domain is fused to the ligand binding domains of nuclear receptors, and expressed in the strain S. cerevisiae PJ 69 - 4 A. The Gal 4 DNA binding domain binds to a Gal 4 response element controlling transcription of a selective marker, and the nuclear receptor ligand-binding domain binds its ligand. This system was developed using the retinoid X receptor, the pregnane X receptor, and the liver X receptor and their ligands 9 -cis retinoic acid, paclitaxel, and oxysterols, respectively. Yeast survive on selective plates only {{in the presence of}} both components: a nuclear receptor and the corresponding ligand. Growth was observed at the highest concentration of ligand (10 - 5 M) and, compared to Gal 4 -activated growth, the growth density was less and growth time was more. The second generation chemical <b>complementation</b> <b>system</b> is a three-component system comprising a nuclear receptor ligand-binding domain fused to the Gal 4 DNA binding domain, the ligand, and a nuclear receptor coactivator fused to the yeast Gal 4 activation domain. This system was developed using the retinoid X receptor and has been extended to several other nuclear receptors. The sensitivity of chemical complementation is increased 1000 -fold, and growth time and density are equivalent to Gal 4 -activated growth. An assay was developed to provide a quantitative high-throughput assay for evaluating nuclear receptor- ligand interactions, and measuring EC 50 values for the ligand-receptor pairs.

Previously, using bacterial artificial chromosome recombinants of the virus genome, it was reported that the enhancer region of murine CMV (MCMV) is dispensable but performs a key function for viral multiplication (A. Angulo, M. Messerle, U. H. Koszinowski, and P. Ghazal, J. Virol. 72 : 8502 - 8509, 1998). In the present study, we defined, through the reconstitution of infectious enhancerless MCMVs, the growth requirement for the enhancer in tissue culture and explored its significance for steering a productive infection in vivo. A comparison of cis and trans <b>complementation</b> <b>systems</b> for infection of enhancerless virus in permissive fibroblasts revealed a multiplicity-dependent growth phenotype that is severely compromised in the rate of infectious-virus multiplication. The in vivo impact of viruses that have an amputated enhancer was investigated in an extremely sensitive model of MCMV infection, the SCID mouse. Histological examination of spleens, livers, lungs, and salivary glands from animals infected with enhancer-deficient MCMV demonstrated an absence of tissue damage associated with CMV infection. The lack of pathogenic lesions correlated with a defect in replication competence. Enhancerless viruses were not detectable in major target organs harvested from SCID mice. The pathogenesis and growth defect reverted upon restoration of the enhancer. Markedly, while SCID mice infected with 5 PFU of parental MCMV died within 50 days postinfection, all mice infected with enhancerless virus survived {{for the duration of the}} experiment (1 year) after infection with 5 × 105 PFU. Together, these results clarify the importance of the enhancer for MCMV growth in cell culture and underscore the in vivo significance of this region for MCMV virulence and pathogenesis...|$|R

It {{is composed of}} the two peptides Bliα and Bliβ, which act synergistically against various Gram-positive bacteria. The lichenicidin gene cluster was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli, thus constituting the first report to our knowledge of a full reconstitution of a lantibiotic biosynthetic pathway in vivo by a Gram-negative host. This system was further exploited to characterize and assign the function of proteins encoded in the biosynthetic gene cluster in the maturation of lichenicidin peptides. Moreover, a trans <b>complementation</b> <b>system</b> was developed for expression of Bliα and Bliβ variants in vivo. This contribution will spur future studies in the heterologous expression and engineering of lantibiotics...|$|E
40|$|Some {{mammalian}} species show {{an ability}} to discriminate between different lipopolysaccharide (LPS) partial structures (for example, lipid A and its congener LA- 14 -PP, which lacks secondary acyl chains), whereas others do not. Using a novel genetic <b>complementation</b> <b>system</b> involving the transduction of immortalized macrophages from genetically unresponsive C 3 H/HeJ mice, we now {{have shown that the}} species-dependent discrimination between intact LPS and tetra-acyl LPS partial structures is fully attributable to the species origin of Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr 4), an essential membrane-spanning component of the mammalian LPS sensor. Because Tlr 4 interprets the chemical structure of an LPS molecule, we conclude that LPS must achieve close physical proximity with Tlr 4 in the course of signal transduction...|$|E
40|$|While Classical Greek has a {{particularly}} rich <b>complementation</b> <b>system,</b> in later times {{there is a}} tendency towards finite complementation. In this context, Cristofaro (1996) has claimed that the Classical opposition whereby the accusative and infinitive is used for non-factive complements, and ὅτι with the indicative and the accusative and participle for factive ones, is disappearing, ὅτι being used as a ‘generic’ complementiser. In this article, I investigate to what extent Cristofaro’s (1996) claim of the pragmatic neutralisation of complementation patterns can be upheld, and whether it could be claimed that a new pragmatic opposition, in terms of ‘register’, is being established. For this purpose, I turn towards documentary papyri, a corpus which is particularly fruitful for socio-historical investigations...|$|E
40|$|Replication of {{influenza}} viral genomic RNA (vRNA) is catalyzed by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (vRdRP). Complementary RNA (cRNA) is first copied from vRNA, and progeny vRNAs are then amplified from the cRNA. Although vRdRP and viral RNA are minimal requirements, efficient cell-free replication {{could not be}} reproduced using only these viral factors. Using a biochemical <b>complementation</b> assay <b>system,</b> we found a novel activity in the nuclear extracts of uninfected cells, designated IREF- 2, that allows robust unprimed vRNA synthesis from a cRNA template. IREF- 2 was shown to consist of host-derived proteins, pp 32 and APRIL. IREF- 2 interacts with a free form of vRdRP and preferentially upregulates vRNA synthesis rather than cRNA synthesis. Knockdown experiments indicated that IREF- 2 is involved in in vivo viral replication. On {{the basis of these}} results and those of previous studies, a plausible role(s) for IREF- 2 during the initiation processes of vRNA replication is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Each {{mammalian}} cell type {{has a unique}} gene expression pattern that supports its specialized function. Mutations in factors that regulate gene expression can disrupt normal function and cause human disease, though the mechanistic consequences of these defects are often unknown. Here, we address how alterations in the transcription factor GATA 1 lead to distinct hematologic disorders by combining structural, biochemical, and genomic approaches with gene <b>complementation</b> <b>systems</b> that examine GATA 1 function in biologically relevant cellular contexts. We first investigated missense mutations in the GATA 1 N-terminal zinc finger (NF) and found that NF mutations impair association with essential GATA 1 cofactors. Several NF mutations diminish FOG 1 binding, resulting in greatly reduced transcriptional activation and repression. This severely impairs erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation and correlates with pronounced clinical phenotypes. Notably, clinical severity parallels the degree of FOG 1 disruption. Unexpectedly, NF mutations shown to disrupt DNA binding of GATA 1 in vitro did not measurably affect target gene occupancy in vivo. Rather, one of these falls into a subset of mutations that diminish TAL 1 complex binding. Reduced association with the TAL 1 complex moderately impairs transcriptional activation, resulting in subtle defects in erythroid and megakaryocyte development that correlate with relatively mild disease presentations. Remarkably, different substitutions at the same amino acid position can selectively inhibit TAL 1 complex or FOG 1 binding, producing distinct cellular and clinical phenotypes. We next examined splice site mutations in the second exon of GATA 1 {{that lead to the}} expression of an amino-truncated protein called GATA 1 short (GATA 1 s). We found that GATA 1 s was significantly impaired in binding to erythroid-specific target genes, while occupancy at megakaryocyte-specific genes was normal. This results in a strongly diminished erythroid gene expression program and inhibits erythroid maturation, similar to the phenotype observed in patients. In concert, our findings uncover novel molecular mechanisms that link genetic defects in GATA 1 to cellular and human phenotypes. Applying this knowledge to the clinic should improve patient diagnosis, classification, and treatment. More broadly, this work highlights the power of gene complementation assays for elucidating the underlying basis of disease, and serves {{as a model for the}} study of other disease-causing mutations. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A concept called {{stochastic}} complementation {{is an idea}} {{which occurs}} naturally, although not always explicitly, in the theory and application of finite Markov chains. This paper brings this idea to the forefront with an explicit definition and a development {{of some of its}} properties. Applications of stochastic complementation are explored with respect to problems involving uncoupling procedures in the theory of Markov chains. Furthermore, the role of stochastic complementation {{in the development of the}} classical Simon–Ando theory of nearly reducible system is presented. Key words.
