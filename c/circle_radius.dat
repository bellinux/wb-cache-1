50|$|While 50% is a {{very common}} {{definition}} for CEP, the circle dimension can be defined for percentages.

50|$|Now {{if all the}} (constant-length) tangents used in {{constructing}} the ring are translated so that their points of tangency coincide, {{the result is a}} circular disk of known radius (and easily computed area).

50|$|The Tata Pixel {{is able to}} {{maneuver}} and park in tight spaces due to the zero turn toroidal traction-drive, Infinitely Variable Transmission (IVT), and due to its steering system design. This results in a turning <b>circle</b> <b>radius</b> of 2.6 meters. The steering and the transmission work together so that each wheel is driven independently with inputs from the steering system. By applying reverse drive on a single rear wheel and forward drive on a single front wheel, the car is able to turn almost in its own length.|$|E

50|$|Center pivot {{irrigation}} {{is a form}} of {{overhead sprinkler}} irrigation consisting of several segments of pipe (usually galvanized steel or aluminum) joined together and supported by trusses, mounted on wheeled towers with sprinklers positioned along its length. The machine moves in a circular pattern and is fed with water from the pivot point {{at the center of the}} circle. The outside set of wheels sets the master pace for the rotation (typically once every three days). The inner sets of wheels are mounted at hubs between two segments and use angle sensors to detect when the bend at the joint exceeds a certain threshold, and thus, the wheels should be rotated to keep the segments aligned. Center pivots are typically less than 1600 feet (500 meters) in length (<b>circle</b> <b>radius)</b> with the most common size being the standard 1/4 mile (400 m) machine.|$|E

5000|$|Following Satō Moshun [...] and Leonardo da Vinci , {{we can use}} inscribed regular polygons in a {{different}} way. Suppose we inscribe a hexagon. Cut the hexagon into six triangles by splitting it from the center. Two opposite triangles both touch two common diameters; slide them along one so the radial edges are adjacent. They now form a parallelogram, with the hexagon sides making two opposite edges, {{one of which is}} the base, s. Two radial edges form slanted sides, and the height is h (as in the Archimedes proof). In fact, we can assemble all the triangles into one big parallelogram by putting successive pairs next to each other. The same is true if we increase to eight sides and so on. For a polygon with 2n sides, the parallelogram will have a base of length ns, and a height h. As the number of sides increases, the length of the parallelogram base approaches half the circle circumference, and its height approaches the <b>circle</b> <b>radius.</b> In the limit, the parallelogram becomes a rectangle with width r and height r.|$|E
50|$|Suppose {{that the}} area C {{enclosed}} by the circle {{is greater than the}} area T = 1⁄2cr of the triangle. Let E denote the excess amount. Inscribe a square in the circle, so that its four corners lie on the circle. Between the square and the circle are four segments. If the total area of those gaps, G4, is greater than E, split each arc in half. This makes the inscribed square into an inscribed octagon, and produces eight segments with a smaller total gap, G8. Continue splitting until the total gap area, Gn, is less than E. Now the area of the inscribed polygon, Pn = C − Gn, must be greater than that of the triangle.But this forces a contradiction, as follows. Draw a perpendicular from the center to the midpoint of a side of the polygon; its length, h, is less than the <b>circle</b> <b>radius.</b> Also, let each side of the polygon have length s; then the sum of the sides, ns, is less than the circle circumference. The polygon area consists of n equal triangles with height h and base s, thus equals 1⁄2nhs. But since h < r and ns < c, the polygon area must be less than the triangle area, 1⁄2cr, a contradiction. Therefore, our supposition that C might be greater than T must be wrong.|$|E
