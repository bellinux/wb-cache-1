2500|$|The [...] by [...] {{windows are}} {{designed}} to prevent inmates from knowing their specific location within the complex because they can see only the sky and roof through them, making it virtually impossible to plan an escape. Inmates exercise in a concrete pit resembling an empty swimming pool, also designed {{to prevent them from}} knowing their location in the facility. The pit is only large enough for a prisoner to walk 10 steps in a straight line, or 31 steps in a circle. Telecommunication with the outside world is forbidden, and food is hand-delivered by correction officers. However, inmates sent here from other prisons can potentially be allowed to eat in a shared dining room. The prison as a whole contains a multitude of motion detectors and cameras, and 1,400 remote-controlled steel doors. Officers in the prison's control center monitor inmates 24 hours a day and can activate a [...] "panic button" [...] that instantly closes every door in the facility should an escape attempt be suspected. Pressure pads and [...] razor wire fences surround the perimeter, which is patrolled by heavily armed officers with attack dogs. In extreme cases of inmate misbehavior, the center of the prison houses an area known as [...] "Z-Unit" [...] or [...] "The Black Hole," [...] which can hold up to 148 prisoners in completely darkened and fully soundproofed cells. Each Z-Unit cell is equipped with a full set of body restraints that are built directly into the <b>concrete</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E

6000|$|Thus--a vivid fact as {{yet only}} in a few hundred skulls or so--the vast {{catastrophe}} of the Great War gathered behind the idle, dispersed and confused spectacle of an indifferent world, very much as the storms and rains of late September gathered behind the glow and lassitudes of August, and with scarcely more of set human intention. For {{the greater part of}} mankind the European international situation was at most something in the papers, no more important than the political disturbances in South Africa, where the Herzogites were curiously uneasy, or the possible trouble between Turkey and Greece. The things that really interested people in England during the last months of peace were boxing and the summer sales. A brilliant young Frenchman, Carpentier, who had knocked out Bombardier Wells, came over again to defeat Gunboat Smith, and did so to the infinite delight of France and the whole Latin world, amidst the generous applause of Anglo-Saxondom. And there was also a British triumph over the Americans at polo, and a lively and cultured newspaper discussion about a proper motto for the arms of the London County Council. The trial of Madame Caillaux filled the papers with animated reports and vivid pictures; Gregori Rasputin was stabbed and became the subject of much lively gossip about the Russian Court; and Ulivi, the Italian impostor who claimed he could explode mines by means of an [...] "ultra-red" [...] ray, was exposed and fled with a lady, very amusingly. For a few days all the work at Woolwich Arsenal was held up because a certain Mr. Entwhistle, having refused to erect a machine on a <b>concrete</b> <b>bed</b> laid down by non-unionists, was rather uncivilly dismissed, and the Irish trouble pounded along its tiresome mischievous way.

It features an audible and visual alarm system to warn users to leave the path if flooding is imminent. Extensions to this path have been proposed, but continue to receive much opposition.

40|$|In a {{world with}} an {{increasing}} urban population, analysing the construction impacts of sanitation infrastructures through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is necessary for defining the best environmental management strategies. In this study, {{the environmental impacts of}} one linear meter of sewer constructive solution were analysed for different pipe materials and diameters used in Southern Europe; a unit of different sewer appurtenances (pump, manhole and inspection chamber) was also considered. The impacts of the pipe materials were compared considering different lifespan periods and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) {{turned out to be the}} worst option, being polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and concrete the most favourable ones. Few data are available on the material and energy flows in the installation stage; therefore, a comparative analysis of trenches with sand and <b>concrete</b> <b>bedding</b> was conducted. The results show that the installation stage represents up to 80 % of the total life-cycle impact of the constructive solutions. Concrete pipes with half-concrete/half-sand bedding are the best option and produce 20 - 30 % of the impact of HDPE pipes with <b>concrete</b> <b>bedding.</b> Hence, designers should focus not only on the pipe but also on the trench model. A methodology was presented to enable the impact aggregation of the different sewer elements, and Betanzos (Spain) was selected to conduct a pilot study in small cities. In the future, studies will need to incorporate the use and maintenance stage, as it is not standard and varies according to the physical features of the cities. Finally, this study provides basic concepts for developing eco-efficiency indicators...|$|R
30|$|At the Inde River, a river {{reach of}} 5  km {{was not only}} restored, but also {{relocated}} and enlarged to a 13 -km-long reach and monitored over a time period {{of more than one}} decade. A restoration over such a length and a monitoring program over such a long time period focusing on the fluvial morphodynamics of the river are unique. Usually, restorations encompass only several hundred meters of a river. The restoration of the Emscher River, which started in 1990 AD, can be seen as an exception because it encompasses the entire course of the river. The Emscher River and its tributaries are converted from highly modified open wastewater channels with <b>concrete</b> <b>beds</b> to near-natural river systems in a large-scale restoration project of more than 30  years [46].

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} flexural bond strength of thin <b>bed</b> <b>concrete</b> masonry. Flexural bond strength of masonry depends upon the mortar type, the techniques of dispersion of mortar and the surface texture (roughness) of concrete blocks.

This paper reports {{a study on the}} examination of the effect of mortar compositions, dispersion methods and unit surface textures to the flexural bond strength of thin <b>bed</b> <b>concrete</b> masonry. Three types of polymer modified glue mortars, three surface textures and four techniques of mortar dispersion have been used in preparing 108 four point flexural test specimens. All mortar joints have been carefully prepared to ensure achievement of 2 mm layer polymer mortar thickness on average. The results exhibit the flexural bond strength of thin <b>bed</b> <b>concrete</b> masonry much is higher than that of the conventional masonry; moreover the unit surface texture and the mortar dispersion methods are found to have significant influence on the flexural bond strength...|$|R

5000|$|However, the {{problems}} of building on a marshy site next to the river soon made it necessary to change the plans substantially. The depth of the foundations was increased to utilise a <b>concrete</b> <b>bed</b> 14 ft thick, supported by piles 30 ft long. The part-built fort began subsiding and cracking in 1865, causing the abandonment of plans to mount guns on the roof.

A moat and earthworks provided further protection on the riverine side of the fort. Conditions for the men working on the fort's construction were said to be extremely unpleasant, due to the waterlogged conditions. Outbreaks of malaria and bronchitis were persistent problems for the workforce. The Chief Royal Engineer wrote in August 1864 after visiting the site: [...] "The officers' quarters at Cliffe are a mere hut, an abominable stinking place in summer, very cold and wet in winter.
