In the present study we show the same inhibitory effect of both lectins on the <b>cerulein</b> pancreatitis of rats. This acute pancreatitis was induced by supramaximal injections (5 µg/kg/h iv or 10 µg/kg/h ip) of the CCK analogue <b>cerulein</b> in rats every hour. To monitor the degree of pancreatitis, we measured the number and diameter of injury vacuoles in the pancreatic acinar cells {{as one of the most}} important signs of this type of pancreatitis by light microscopic morphometry with two different systems on paraffin sections. Furthermore, the serum α-amylase activity was measured biochemically. We found a correlation between the diameter of vacuoles inside the acinar cells and the serum enzyme activity up to 24 h. The simultaneous ip administration of <b>cerulein</b> and WGA or UEA in a dosage of 125 µg/kg/h for 8 h led to a reduction of vacuolar diameter from 13. 1 ± 2. 0 µm (<b>cerulein)</b> to 7. 5 ± 1. 1 µm (<b>cerulein</b> + WGA) or 7. 2 ± 1. 3 µm (<b>cerulein</b> + UEA).

40|$|Backgound/Aims: The {{injection}} of <b>cerulein,</b> an analogue of the pancreatic secretagogue cholecystokinin (CCK), induces acute pancreatitis in mice that {{is accompanied by}} the synthesis of the transcription factor Egr- 1. The signaling cascade that connects <b>cerulein</b> stimulation with enhanced Egr- 1 biosynthesis was analyzed. Methods: AR 42 J rat pancreatic acinar cells were used as a model system to measure cerulein-induced Egr- 1 biosynthesis. For comparison, the signaling cascade induced by activation of Gαq-coupled designer receptors with the designer drug clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) was investigated. Results: Stimulation of AR 42 J cells with <b>cerulein</b> induced a robust and transient biosynthesis of Egr- 1. The signaling cascade connecting <b>cerulein</b> stimulation with Egr- 1 gene expression required elevated levels of cytosolic Ca 2 + and the activation of the protein kinases PKC, Raf and ERK, while expression of MKP- 1 prevented Egr- 1 biosynthesis in cerulein-stimulated AR 42 J cells. In addition, ternary complex factors are required to connect <b>cerulein</b> stimulation with enhanced transcription of the Egr- 1 gene. Egr- 1 biosynthesis induced in CNO-stimulated AR 42 J pancreatic acinar cells expressing Gαq-coupled designer receptors required identical signaling molecules, although subtle differences were observed in comparison to cerulein/CCK receptor signaling. Conclusion: We propose that overstimulation of the canonical Gαq-induced signaling pathway may be crucial for inducing acute pancreatitis...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the precise effects of CCK amphibian analogue, <b>cerulein,</b> on small-intestinal myoelectric activity in rams in the course of chronic experiments. Five rams underwent implantation of bipolar platinum electrodes to the duodenal bulb, the distal duodenum and jejunum. During continuous myoelectrical and motor recordings, 0. 15 M NaCl or the various doses of <b>cerulein</b> were administered intravenously. Short infusions of the smallest dose of <b>cerulein</b> exerted a slight and mostly insignificant effect on the duodenal bulb and the duodenal myoelectric activity index (MAI) values. In the duodenal bulb, the effects of <b>cerulein</b> on myoelectric activity were dose-dependent and closely related to the phase of the MMC. In the duodenum, the higher doses of the hormone evoked short stimulatory response followed by longer inhibitory biphasic effects on MAI. These effects were inversely related to the duration of hormone injection. Infusions of hormones at the higher doses caused a less pronounced biphasic effect.

In this study we show that <b>cerulein</b> treatment activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) but not p 38 MAPK during the early phase of cerulein-induced AP (2 h after the first injection of <b>cerulein).</b> Therefore, by using the MAPK inhibitors SP 600125 (a specific JNK inhibitor) and PD 98059 (a specific ERK inhibitor), we have unmasked the particular MAPK that underlies the modulation of the expression levels of these PTPs. JNK would act by preventing SHP- 1 protein expression from increasing beyond a certain level. ERK 1 / 2 was the main MAPK involved in the increase in SHP- 2 protein expression due to <b>cerulein.</b> JNK negatively modulated the SH 2 -domain containing PTPs. Both MAPKs {{played a role in}} the increase in PTP 1 B protein expression due to <b>cerulein.</b> Finally, by using the white blood cell inhibitors vinblastine sulfate, gadolinium chloride and FK 506 (tacrolimus), we show that the macrophage activity or T-lymphocytes does not modulate the expression of any of the PTPs, although neutrophil infiltration was found to be a regulator of SHP- 2 and PTP 1 B protein expression due to <b>cerulein...</b>|$|E
40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) {{are known to}} be {{involved}} in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic pancreatitis. The cholecystokinin (CCK) analog <b>cerulein</b> causes pathophysiological, morphological, and biochemical events similar to those observed in human acute pancreatitis. The oxidant-sensitive transcription factor NF-κB plays a critical role in the development of <b>cerulein</b> pancreatitis by regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the pancreas. Lycopene has an anti-oxidant effect in various cells. In the present study, we investigated whether <b>cerulein</b> induces NF-κB activation and IL- 6 expression in pancreatic acinar cells and whether lycopene inhibits these events. NF-κB-DNA-binding activity was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and mRNA expression was analyzed by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) and real-time RT–PCR analyses. The IL- 6 concentration in the medium was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our results showed that <b>cerulein</b> induced IL- 6 expression in a time-dependent manner. NF-κB-DNA-binding activity and intracellular levels of ROS in pancreatic acinar cells were increased by <b>cerulein.</b> Lycopene inhibited the cerulein-induced increase in intracellular ROS, NF-κB activation, and IL- 6 expression in pancreatic acinar cells in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, lycopene may be beneficial in the prevention and/or treatment of acute pancreatitis by inhibiting the activation of NF-κB and the expression of inflammatory cytokines through reduction in intracellular levels of ROS in pancreatic acinar cells...|$|E

Group A served as controls and received subcutaneous saline. Group B 1 received one application of <b>Cerulein</b> and was sacrificed after 24 h. Group B 2 was similar to B 1, but was sacrificed two weeks later.

The intracellular oxidative balance and {{the characteristics of the}} secretion of isolated rat pancreatic acinar cells stimulated with the cholecystokinin analogue <b>cerulein</b> were assayed after acute oral ethanol (4 g/kg) load. Pancreatic acinar cells from ethanol-treated rats showed a significant (p < 0. 02) lower content of total glutathione and protein sulfhydryls, and higher levels of oxidized glutathione (p < 0. 03), malondialdehyde, and protein carbonyls (p < 0. 05). Ethanol-intoxicated acinar cells showed a lower baseline amylase output compared to controls, with the difference being significantly exacerbated by <b>cerulein</b> stimulation. After <b>cerulein,</b> the release of protein carbonyls by ethanol-treated cells was significantly increased, whereas that of protein sulfhydryls was significantly decreased. In conclusion, ethanol oxidatively damages pancreatic acinar cells; <b>cerulein</b> stimulation is followed by a lower output of amylase and by a higher release of oxidized proteins by pancreatic acinar cells from ethanol-treated rats.

40|$|Acute {{pancreatitis}} is {{an inflammatory}} condition {{that may lead}} to multisystemic organ failure with considerable mortality. Recently, resolvin D 1 (RvD 1) as an endogenous anti-inflammatory lipid mediator has been confirmed to protect against many inflammatory diseases. This study was designed to investigate the effects of RvD 1 in acute pancreatitis and associated lung injury. Acute pancreatitis varying from mild to severe was induced by <b>cerulein</b> or <b>cerulein</b> combined with LPS, respectively. Mice were pretreated with RvD 1 at a dose of 300 ng/mouse 30 min before the first injection of <b>cerulein.</b> Severity of AP was assessed by biochemical markers and histology. Serum cytokines and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels in pancreas and lung were determined for assessing the extent of inflammatory response. NF-kappa B activation was determined by Western blotting. The injection of <b>cerulein</b> or <b>cerulein</b> combined with LPS resulted in local injury in the pancreas and corresponding systemic inflammatory changes with pronounced severity in the <b>cerulein</b> and LPS group. Pretreated RvD 1 significantly reduced the degree of amylase, lipase, TNF-alpha, and IL- 6 serum levels; the MPO activities in the pancreas and the lungs; the pancreatic NF-kappa B activation; and the severity of pancreatic injury and associated lung injury, especially in the severe acute pancreatitis model. These results suggest that RvD 1 is capable of improving injury of pancreas and lung and exerting anti-inflammatory effects through the inhibition of NF-kappa B activation in experimental acute pancreatitis, with more notable protective effect in severe acute pancreatitis. These findings indicate that RvD 1 may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy in the management of severe acute pancreatitis.

40|$|Acute {{pancreatitis}} (AP) is {{a potentially}} lethal disease characterized by inflammation and parenchymal cell death; also, {{the severity of}} AP correlates directly with necrosis and inversely with apoptosis. However, mechanisms of regulating cell death in AP remain unclear. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone protein GRP 78 has anti-apoptotic properties, in addition to modulating ER stress responses. This study used RNA interference (RNAi) approach to investigate the potential role of GRP 78 in regulating apoptosis during AP. In vitro models of AP were successfully developed by treating AR 42 J cells with <b>cerulein</b> or <b>cerulein</b> plus lipoplysaccharide (LPS). There was more pancreatic inflammation and less apoptosis with the <b>cerulein</b> plus LPS treatment. Furthermore, knockdown of GRP 78 expression markedly promoted apoptosis and reduced necrosis in pancreatic acinar cells. This was accomplished by enhancing the activation of caspases and inhibiting the activity of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), {{as well as a}} receptor interacting protein kinase- 1 (RIPK 1), which is a key mediator of necrosis. This attenuated the severity of pancreatic inflammation, especially after <b>cerulein</b> plus LPS treatment.

Platelet-activating factor (PAF) seems to be an important mediator of the inflammatory response. The present evidence includes: 1) pancreatic PAF levels increased in rats in which cerulein-induced pancreatitis was initiated, concomitant with an increase in calcium concentrations in the pancreatic tissue; 2) treatment of rats exposed to <b>cerulein</b> with WEB 2170, a PAF receptor antagonist, was shown to reduce inflammatory injury, as demonstrated by decreases in pancreatic weight, Evan's blue extravasation, and myeloperoxidase activity and an improvement in pancreatic histology. In an idealized in vitro experiment mimicking cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis, in which pancreatic acini were employed, <b>cerulein</b> induced amylase release, an increase in [Ca 2 +]i, and an increase in PAF synthesis. Whereas amylase release was induced by low concentrations of <b>cerulein</b> (10 (- 11) mol/L), relatively high concentrations of <b>cerulein</b> (10 (- 9) mol/L) were required for the observed increases in PAF synthesis and the [Ca 2 +]i, indicating that these two responses may not occur under physiological conditions. The present study suggests that the pancreatic accumulation of PAF coupled with Ca 2 + overload are important biochemical components of the pathophysiology of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. In fact, PAF production may serve as a primary mediator of inflammation observed during pancreatic hyperstimulation. This is an important observation that will allow a more detailed characterization of the molecular basis of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis...|$|E

Six hours after <b>cerulein</b> or saline injections, the animals were killed by decap-itation. Blood samples were collected to analyze amylase, lipase, and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL- 1 β). Pancreas tis-sues were taken for the determination of tissue glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, Na+, K+-ATPase and myelo-peroxidase (MPO) activities. Formation of reactive oxygen species in pancreatic tissue samples was monitored by using chemilumines-cence (CL) technique with luminol and lucigenin probes, while the extent of tissue injury was analyzed microscopically. Results: Acute pancreatitis caused a significant decrease in tissue GSH level and Na+, K+-ATPase activity, which was accompanied with significant increases in the pancreatic MDA, luminol and luci-genin chemiluminescences (CL) levels and MPO activity. Similarly TNF-α and IL- 1 β levels were elevated in the pancreatic group as compared to control group.

40|$|CONTEXT: Hepatic {{injury is}} {{considered}} one of the critical complications associated with acute pancreatitis. It was proposed that initial insults to the liver in the early phase of the attack have an important priming effect, and the subsequent infectious attack (e. g. infectious pancreatic necrosis, bacterial translocation episode) constitutes a second attack on the liver. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of priming by induction of <b>cerulein</b> pancreatitis and a following second attack by endotoxemia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Plasma clearance and biliary excretion of indocyanine green (a hepatophillic hydrophobic organic anion). DESIGN: A model of acute pancreatitis in rats. SETTING: Four groups of rats: untreated control, <b>cerulein</b> pancreatitis, endotoxemia and endotoxemia following the induction of <b>cerulein</b> pancreatitis (pancreatitis + endotoxemia). RESULTS: Biliary indocyanine green excretion was significantly disturbed only in the pancreatitis + endotoxemia group. Plasma clearance (a reflection of hepatic uptake) of indocyanine green from the blood was only slightly affected in endotoxemia group.

40|$|Coagulation is {{recognized}} as {{a key player in}} inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The aim of the current research was to examine the effect of pretreatment with acenocoumarol on the development of acute pancreatitis (AP) evoked by <b>cerulein.</b> Methods: AP was induced in rats by <b>cerulein</b> administered intraperitoneally. Acenocoumarol (50, 100 or 150 µg/kg/dose/day) or saline were given once daily for seven days before AP induction. Results: In rats with AP, pretreatment with acenocoumarol administered at the dose of 50 or 100 µg/kg/dose/day improved pancreatic histology, reducing the degree of edema and inflammatory infiltration, and vacuolization of acinar cells. Moreover, pretreatment with acenocoumarol given at the dose of 50 or 100 µg/kg/dose/day reduced the AP-evoked increase in pancreatic weight, serum activity of amylase and lipase, and serum concentration of pro-inflammatory interleukin- 1 β, as well as ameliorated pancreatic DNA synthesis and pancreatic blood flow. In contrast, acenocoumarol given at the dose of 150 μg/kg/dose did not exhibit any protective effect against cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Conclusion: Low doses of acenocoumarol, given before induction of AP by <b>cerulein,</b> inhibit the development of that inflammation...|$|E

40|$|Cholecystokinin exerts a {{composite}} influence on gastrointestinal motility but {{little is known}} about its effect on small-intestinal slow waves. Thus, six rams were implanted with four bipolar serosal electrodes onto the duodeno-jejunal wall. In the course of chronic experiments the myoelectric activity was continuously recorded in the non-fasted animals. After recording of the full normal migrating myoelectric complex (MMC), 0. 15 M NaCl or CCK peptides were injected intravenously during various phases of the next MMC cycle. Five mℓ of saline was injected over 30 s during phases 1, 2 a, or 2 b of the MMC. <b>Cerulein</b> was administered at doses of 1 (over 30 s), 10 (over 30 or 60 s), or 100 ng/kg (over 30, 60, 120 or 300 s) and cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-OP) at doses 20 times higher. CCK peptides were applied during early or late phase 1 of the MMC and during phases 2 a and 2 b of the MMC. In the course of additional experiments, saline and hormone administration was directly preceded by infusion of proglumide, an unspecific CCK receptor antagonist, at a dose of 10 mg/kg. The myoelectric recordings were continued until the arrival of a subsequent regular phase 3 of theMMC. In the duodenal bulb, slow waves were occasionally observed. In the duodenum the slow-wave frequency oscillated between 20 and 24 cpm and in the jejunum between 19 and 22 cpm before or after CCK peptides and proglumide. In the duodenum the slow-wave amplitude increased significantly after all doses of <b>cerulein</b> injected during phase 2 b of the MMC. After administration of CCK-OP changes in duodenal slow-wave amplitude were not significant but exhibited a tendency similar to those after <b>cerulein.</b> In the jejunum, injection of <b>cerulein</b> and CCK-OP during phase 2 of the MMC increased the slow-wave amplitude significantly and the duration of these changes was longer than in the duodenum. After infusion of proglumide, administration of <b>cerulein</b> at the low dose over 30 s and at the high dose over 300 s in the course of late phase 1 and phases 2 a and 2 b of the MMC, significantly increased the duodenal slow-wave amplitude. <b>Cerulein</b> injection during phase 2 b of the MMC at the high dose over 30 and 60 s, preceded by proglumide infusion, significantly inhibited the duodenal slow-wave amplitude. In the jejunum these changes were even more pronounced and their duration was much longer. It is concluded that CCK peptides affect slow-wave amplitude in the duodeno-jejunum in non-fasted sheep. This effect is stronger in the jejunum and is altered but not abolished by pretreatment with proglumide. <b>Cerulein</b> evokes more pronounced alterations in the slow-wave amplitude than CCK-OP in conscious sheep...|$|E

40|$|Acute {{pancreatitis}} is a {{multifactorial disease}} {{associated with the}} premature activation of digestive enzymes. The genes expressed in pancreatic acinar cells determine {{the severity of the}} disease. The present study determined the differentially expressed genes in pancreatic acinar cells treated with <b>cerulein</b> as an in vitro model of acute pancreatitis. Pancreatic acinar AR 42 J cells were stimulated with 10 − 8 M <b>cerulein</b> for 4 h, and genes with altered expression were identified using a cDNA microarray for 4, 000 rat genes and validated by real-time PCR. These genes showed a 2. 5 -fold or higher increase with cerulein: lithostatin, guanylate cyclase, myosin light chain kinase 2, cathepsin C, progestin-induced protein, and pancreatic trypsin 2. Stathin 1 and ribosomal protein S 13 showed a 2. 5 -fold or higher decreases in expression. Real-time PCR analysis showed time-dependent alterations of these genes. Using commercially available antibodies specific for guanylate cyclase, myosin light chain kinase 2, and cathepsin C, a time-dependent increase in these proteins were observed by Western blotting. Thus, disturbances in proliferation, differentiation, cytoskeleton arrangement, enzyme activity, and secretion may be underlying mechanisms of acute pancreatitis.

40|$|Acute {{pancreatitis}} is {{an inflammatory}} process of variable severity, and leukocytes {{are thought to}} {{play a key role}} in the development of pancreatitis and pancreatitis-associated lung injury. The effects of mediators released by these inflammatory cells may induce tissue damage. The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of the chemokine, macrophage inflammatory protein- 2 (MIP- 2), in the pathogenesis of cerulein-induced pancreatitis and pancreatitis-associated lung injury. The severity of pancreatitis was measured by serum amylase, pancreatic edema, acinar cell necrosis, and myeloperoxidase activity. Lung injury was quantitated by evaluating lung microvascular permeability and lung myeloperoxidase activity. To determine the role of MIP- 2 in the pathophysiology of the disease, anti-MIP- 2 antibody was administered either 1 hour before or 2 hours after the start of <b>cerulein</b> administration. MIP- 2 concentrations increased in serum, pancreas, and lung tissues in mice treated with <b>cerulein.</b> Anti-MIP- 2 antibody administrated either before or after <b>cerulein</b> partially protected against pancreas and lung injury.

40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVES: Extracellular histones {{are rapidly}} cleared by {{the liver and}} rarely {{detectable}} in the circulation unless there is extensive cell death, as in severe trauma and sepsis. This study investigated whether circulating histones are elevated in experimental acute pancreatitis models and correlate to disease severity. METHODS: Acute pancreatitis was induced in mice by: (1) 4 or (2) 12 intraperitoneal injections of <b>cerulein</b> (50 μg/kg) at 1 hour apart; (3) retrograde infusion of 3. 5 % sodium taurocholate into the biliopancreatic duct. Mice were sacrificed at various time points to collect blood and tissues. Severity of pancreatitis was assessed by biochemical markers and histopathology. Circulating histones were determined by Western blotting. RESULTS: Four <b>cerulein</b> injections induced edematous pancreatitis, whereas 12 <b>cerulein</b> injections and ductal taurocholate infusion caused necrotizing pancreatitis. Circulating histones were barely detectable {{in the blood of}} animals with edematous pancreatitis but significantly increased in necrotizing pancreatitis. The levels of circulating histones were strongly correlated to histopathological scores of necrosis of the pancreas. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating histones increased significantly in necrotizing pancreatitis due to extensive pancreatic acinar cell death. Levels of circulating histones may have translational potential as a biomarker of disease severity...|$|E
40|$|Existing {{models of}} acute {{pancreatitis}} have limitations to studying novel therapy. Whereas some produce mild self-limited pancreatitis, others result in sudden necrotizing injury. The authors developed an improved model providing homogeneous moderately severe injury by superimposing secretory hyperstimulation on minimal intraductal bile acid exposure. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 231) received low-pressure intraductal glycodeoxycholic acid (GDOC) {{at very low}} (5 or 10 mmol/L) concentrations followed by intravenous <b>cerulein.</b> <b>Cerulein</b> or GDOC alone caused only very mild inflammation. However, GDOC combined with <b>cerulein</b> was uniformly associated with more edema (p less than 0. 0005), acinar necrosis (p less than 0. 01), inflammation (p less than 0. 006), and hemorrhage (p less than 0. 01). Pancreatic injury was further increased and death was potentiated by increasing volume and duration of intraductal low-dose GDOC infusion. There was significant morphologic progression between 6 and 24 hours. The authors conclude that (1) combining minimal intraductal bile acid exposure with intravenous hyperstimulation produces homogeneous pancreatitis of intermediate severity that can be modulated at will; (2) the injury is progressive over at least 24 hours with finite mortality rate; (3) the model provides superior opportunity to study innovative therapy...|$|E

Rhodamine-stained platelets were used to investigate velocity and endothelial adhesion in capillaries and venules. In addition, erythrocyte velocity and leukocyte adhesion were evaluated. Serum amylase, thromboxane A 2, and histology were evaluated after 24  h in additional animals of each group. Results showed that 24  h after <b>cerulein</b> application, histology exhibited a mild AP, whereas GDOC induced severe necrotizing AP. Intravital microscopy showed significantly more platelet–endothelium interaction, reduced erythrocyte velocity, and increased leukocyte adherence in animals with AP compared to control animals.

Glutathione peroxidase was utilized as an indicator of oxidative stress and total antioxidant status as an indicator of total antioxidant tissue capacity. RESULTS: The rats in Groups B and C showed more pancreatic fibrosis than those in Groups A and D (90 %, 70 %, 0 %, and 20 %, respectively). The glutathione peroxidase increased in Group B (455 ± 196 mU/g protein) and Group C (243 ± 206 mU/g protein) with respect to those in Group A (137 ± 80 mU/g protein) and Group D (135 ± 105 mU/g protein).
