5|$|Philosophical behaviorism {{has fallen}} out of favor since {{the latter half of}} the 20th century, coinciding with the rise of cognitivism. Cognitivists reject behaviorism due to several {{perceived}} problems. For example, behaviorism <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be counter-intuitive when it maintains that someone is talking about behavior in the event that a person is experiencing a painful headache.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the New Kingdom, a {{tradition}} had developed that Set had cut Osiris's body into pieces and scattered them across Egypt. Cult centers of Osiris all over the country claimed that the corpse, or particular pieces of it, were found near them. The dismembered parts <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> number as many as forty-two, each piece being equated with one of the forty-two nomes, or provinces, in Egypt. Thus, the god of kingship becomes the embodiment of his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests that Lithuanians began combining their forces {{at the dawn of}} the 13th century. For example, in 1207, soldiers were recruited across Lithuania to fight the German religious orders, and in 1212, Daugirutis' treaty with Novgorod shows that he exerted some degree of influence over a vast area. During the first twenty years of the 13th century, Lithuanians organized some thirty military expeditions to Livonia, Russia, and Poland. Historian Tomas Baranauskas argues that a Lithuanian state <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> exist as early as 1183.|$|E

5|$|Computer science {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the automatic processing of information (or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means of such things as computers. From the beginning, computer programmers {{have been able to}} develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not clear whether computers <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have a mind. Could they, someday, come to have what we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{earliest}} examples of horses being ridden in warfare were horse-mounted archers or spear-throwers, dating to the reigns of the Assyrian rulers Ashurnasirpal II and Shalmaneser III. However, these riders sat far back on their horses, a precarious position for moving quickly, and the horses were held by a handler on the ground, keeping the archer free to use the bow. Thus, these archers were more a type of mounted infantry than true cavalry. The Assyrians developed cavalry in response to invasions by nomadic people from the north, such as the Cimmerians, who entered Asia Minor in the 8th century BC and took over parts of Urartu {{during the reign of}} Sargon II, approximately 721 BC. Mounted warriors such as the Scythians also had an influence on the region in the 7th century BC. By the reign of Ashurbanipal in 669 BC, the Assyrians had learned to sit forward on their horses in the classic riding position still seen today and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be true light cavalry. The ancient Greeks used both light horse scouts and heavy cavalry, although not extensively, possibly due to the cost of keeping horses.|$|E

While the Civil Rights Movement proper did not begin until the 1940s, the historical significance of Omaha in securing civil rights for a variety of American people <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> start in 1876.|$|E
25|$|Because under a {{discretionary}} trust, no one beneficiary <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have {{title to}} any trust assets {{prior to a}} distribution, this made discretionary trusts a powerful weapon for tax planners. Inevitably, the surge in popularity {{has led to a}} legislative response in most jurisdictions, thus in many countries there are now considerable tax disadvantages to discretionary trusts, which has predictably hampered their use outside the scope of charitable trusts.|$|E

25|$|The one failing {{of their}} {{marriage}} was that it remained childless. Head adored children, {{as can be seen}} in his poems and his poetry also gives considerable insight into Head's great desire for a child of his own. In his poem , for example, he takes on the perspective of a woman yearning for 'the fierce joy of motherhood' and presents a sympathetic view of her plight. Head's deeply personal poems also <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> suggest that Ruth had at some point been pregnant (maybe more than once) and perhaps even to term.|$|E
25|$|In April 1963, {{the first}} {{recorded}} infiltration and attack occurred in Borneo. An infiltration force training at Nangabadan was {{split in two}} and prepared for its first operation. On 12 April 1963, one infiltration force attacked and seized the police station at Tebedu in the 1st Division of Sarawak, about 40 miles from Kuching and 2 miles from the border with Kalimantan. The other group attacked the village of Gumbang, South West of Kuching, later in the month. Only about half returned. Confrontation <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have started from a military perspective with the Tebedu attack.|$|E
25|$|In June 1402, Owain {{defeated}} an English force led by Sir Edmund Mortimer at the Battle of Bryn Glas, and Mortimer was captured. Glynd≈µr {{offered to}} release Mortimer {{for a large}} ransom but, {{in sharp contrast to}} his attitude to de Grey, Henry IV refused to pay. Mortimer's nephew <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have had a greater claim to the English throne than Henry himself, so his speedy release was not an option. In response, Mortimer negotiated an alliance with Owain and married one of Owain's daughters. It is also in 1402 that mention of the French and Bretons helping Owain was first heard. The French were certainly hoping to use Wales as they had used Scotland: as a base to fight the English.|$|E

25|$|On February 8, 1597, King Philip II, {{near the}} end of his 42-year reign, issued a Royal Cedula instructing Francisco de Tello de Guzm√°n, then Governor-General of the Philippines to fulfill the laws of tributes and to provide for {{restitution}} of ill-gotten taxes taken from the natives. The decree was published in Manila on August 5, 1598. King Philip died on 13 September, just forty days after the publication of the decree, but his death was not known in the Philippines until middle of 1599, by which time a referendum by which the natives would acknowledge Spanish rule was underway. With the completion of the Philippine referendum of 1599, Spain <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have established legitimate sovereignty over the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|Rather {{than have}} his ideas {{dismissed}} wholesale because of potential flaws {{in any one}} area, Velikovsky then chose to publish them {{as a series of}} book volumes, aimed at a lay audience, dealing separately with his proposals on ancient history, and with areas more relevant to the physical sciences. Velikovsky was a passionate Zionist, and this did steer the focus of his work, although its scope was considerably more far-reaching than this. The entire body of work <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> stem from an attempt to solve the following problem: that to Velikovsky there appeared to be insufficient correlation in the written or archaeological records between Biblical history and what was known {{of the history of the}} area, in particular, Egypt.|$|E
25|$|In the 1830s and 1840s, Japan {{suffered}} an economic crisis, and artists were strictly limited, by law, {{in their use}} of silver and gold, both nearly essential for traditional styles of lacquer decoration. Zeshin compensated by using bronze to simulate the look and texture of iron, and with a variety of other substances and decorative styles to keep his work beautiful, while remaining traditional and doable. Many of his pieces <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> embrace the concept of wabi, that is, beauty and elegance in the very simple, as exemplified by the Japanese tea ceremony. Although very few of his Edo period (pre-1868) pieces survive, it is evident in many of his later pieces that he would use, at times, a very simple and nearly colorless style of decoration, while continuing to use the traditional designs such as flowers and reeds.|$|E
