40|$|Background: Larval {{control is}} of {{paramount}} importance in the reduction of malaria vector abundance and subsequent disease transmission reduction. Understanding larval habitat succession and its ecology in different land use managements and cropping systems can give an insight for effective larval source management practices. This study investigated larval habitat succession and ecological parameters which influence larval abundance in malaria epidemic prone areas of western Kenya. Methods and Findings: A total of 51 aquatic habitats positive for anopheline larvae were surveyed and visited once a week for a period of 85 weeks in succession. Habitats were selected and identified. Mosquito larval species, physico-chemical parameters, habitat size, grass cover, crop cycle and distance to nearest house were recorded. Polymerase chain reaction revealed that An. gambiae s. l was the most dominant vector species comprised of An. gambiae s. s (77. 60 %) and An. arabiensis (18. 34 %), the remaining 4. 06 % had no amplification by polymerase chain reaction. Physico-chemical parameters and habitat size significantly influenced abundance of An. gambiae s. s (P = 0. 024) and An. arabiensis (P = 0. 002) larvae. Further, larval species abundance was influenced by crop cycle (P# 0. 001), grass cover (P# 0. 001), while distance to nearest houses significantly influenced the abundance of mosquito species larvae (r = 0. 920;P# 0. 001).

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of fertilization and interseeding cover crops on the growth of main <b>crops</b> and <b>weeds</b> and the stability of weed suppression over years and main crop species under four-year rotational organic farming. Two cover crops, winter rye (Secale cereale L.) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), were interseeded in furrows of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), soybean (Glycine max Merr.) and maize (Zea mays L.) at 3 - 5 weeks after planting the main crops. The number and dry weight of weeds were measured at the maximum plant height stage of main crops and main crop yields were recorded at their physiological maturity. The light competition between main crops, cover <b>crops</b> and <b>weeds</b> was analyzed by vertical community structure and vegetation cover ratio (VCR) of each crop. Since light competition of main crops with cover <b>crops</b> and <b>weeds</b> was not severe, main crop yields were not suppressed significantly by either cover <b>crops</b> or <b>weeds.</b> Weed growth was suppressed significantly by interseeding cover crops through increasing the VCR of main crops plus cover <b>crops.</b> This <b>weed</b> suppression by interseeding cover crops was stable to the main crop species in rotational cropping systems and to the various environmental conditions, because the cover crops compensated the low VCR of main crops alone at early growth stage especially when main crop growth was depressed by unfavorable environmental conditions. In addition, input of compost and fermented organic fertilizer had positive effects on the main <b>crop</b> yield and <b>weed</b> suppression. It is concluded, therefore, that weeds can be suppressed effectively and stably without yield reductions of main crops by interseeding cover crops with sufficient fertilization in organic farming systems...|$|R

The level of incidence was high in all the five districts, namely Gubalafito, Meket, Woreilu, Wadila, Jama, Legehida and Dessie Zuria. The level of disease severity ranged from 9. 9 and 59. 3 %, while the incidence varied from 50 to 100 %.
