For k at most 5, the distinct cores and corresponding minimal configurations (61 in number) are identified. This provides a method of constructing singular graphs from others of <b>smaller</b> <b>order.</b> Furthermore, it is shown that when a graph has a minimal configuration as an induced subgraph, then it is singular...|$|R

The trignometric collocation method (TCM) is formalized {{to allow for}} the analysis of relatively <b>small</b> <b>order</b> systems directly in physical coordinates. The TCM is extended to large order systems by utilizing modal analysis in a component mode synthesis strategy. The procedure was coded and verified by several check cases. Numerical results for two <b>small</b> <b>order</b> mechanical systems and one large order rotor dynamic system are presented. The method allows for the possibility of approximating periodic responses for large order forced and self-excited nonlinear systems...|$|R

In addition, we show a close relationship between the development of third order loops and the small forces of the granular packing in the sense that almost all third order loops allocate a force component smaller than the average...|$|R
