5|$|The Welsh slate {{industry}} {{was essentially a}} Welsh-speaking industry. Most of the workforce in the main slate-producing areas of North Wales were drawn from the local area, with little immigration from outside Wales. The industry had a considerable influence on {{the culture of the}} area and on that of Wales as a whole. The <b>caban,</b> the cabin where the quarrymen gathered for their lunch break, was often the scene of wide-ranging discussions, which were often formally minuted. A surviving set of minutes from a <b>caban</b> at the Llechwedd mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog for 1908–10 records discussions on Church Disestablishment, tariff reform and other political topics. Eisteddfodau were held, poetry composed and discussed and most of the larger quarries had their own band, with the Oakley band particularly famous. Burn calculates that there are around fifty men judged worthy of an entry in the Dictionary of Welsh Biography who started their working lives as slate quarrymen, compared to only four owners, though obviously there was also a distinct disparity in the numbers of the two groups.|$|E
5|$|In March 1981, {{widespread}} violence {{took place}} in Bangui following elections, after Operation <b>Caban</b> led the French to drop Bokassa (who had begun to call himself Emperor Bokassa I), and replaced him with David Dacko. Opponents of the President met in Bangui and were forced to flee the country. After returning voluntarily to Bangui {{in the autumn of}} 1986, Bokassa went on trial. Initially faced with the death penalty, in February 1988 he was instead sentenced to life imprisonment. His successor was General André Kolingba, army chief of staff of Decko’s army, who took over control from the local French military on 1 September 1981 under the pretext that the country was heading towards civil war. Although he attempted to combat corruption and control the national economy, he was unable to achieve his reforms. By the middle of the 1980s the country’s economic situation had deteriorated as 80% of the revenue went towards meeting the salaries of the staff. Under pressure from France and other western countries, Kolingba restored democracy in the country in 1991 with a multiparty government but elections could be held only three years later in August 1994. During the elections, Ange-Félix Patassé was elected to the post of president. Since he was from northern CAR, the southern group of Kolingba started a rebellion during 1996.|$|E

25|$|The Dol-y-mynach dam – {{it was to}} be one of {{a series}} of three dams that would be built to contain the waters of Afon Claerwen. They were to be {{constructed}} in accordance with the growth of Birmingham. However, the project was never completed even though the masonry foundations of the first dam were laid at the same time the Elan Valley dams were being constructed. The work had to be done in advance because the water level of the <b>Caban</b> Coch would have submerged the site once the reservoir was full. The three-dam project became redundant when newer materials and superior engineering allowed the construction of the single larger Claerwen dam higher up the valley in the 1940/50s.|$|E

500|$|... "When I Was Your Man" [...] {{was written}} by Andrew Wyatt, Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine, while {{production}} was handled by the latter three production-team The Smeezingtons. Having chord progressions Am-C-Dm-G-G7-C (verse) and F-G-C (chorus), the song is written in the key of C Major, with Mars' vocals range from the low note of G3 to the high note of C5. The pop piano ballad finds Mars singing about a pre-fame heartbreak as he regrets letting his woman get away. It starts with a rolling piano riff; unto a nearly scat [...] "vocal cadence": [...] "Same bed but it feels {{just a little bit}} bigger now / Our song on the radio but it don’t sound the same", as he laments the [...] "single state" [...] he created for himself. Next, he sings of his failings; to do right by his woman, [...] "I shoulda bought you flowers / And held your hand / Shoulda gave you all my hours / When I had the chance". Its title phrase re-emerges in the final chorus, juxtaposed by Bruno from all the things he [...] "shoulda" [...] done, into things he hopes his ex’s new man will do; concluding: [...] "Do all of the things I should have done / When I was your man". In an interview to Rolling Stone, Mars revealed, while reluctant, that he wrote the song for his girlfriend, model Jessica <b>Caban,</b> when he was worried about losing her. In contrast with the song, Mars and <b>Caban</b> stayed together; remaining a couple as of 2014. Mars also said, in the interview, that he finds it difficult to perform the song; saying: [...] "You're bringing up all these old emotions again," [...] and that: [...] "It's just like bleeding!" ...|$|E

2500|$|A type of Cuban and Puerto Rican protest music {{started in}} the mid-1960s when a {{movement}} in Cuban music emerged that combined traditional folk music idioms with progressive and often politicized lyrics. This movement of protest music {{came to be known}} as [...] "Nueva trova", and was somewhat similar to that of Nueva canción, however with the advantage of support from the Cuban government, as it promoted the Cuban Revolution – and thus part of revolutionary song. Though originally and still largely Cuban, nueva trova has become popular across Latin America, especially in Puerto Rico and Venezuela. The movements biggest stars included Cubans Silvio Rodríguez, Noel Nicola and Pablo Milanés, as well as Puerto Ricans such as Roy Brown, Andrés Jiménez, Antonio <b>Cabán</b> Vale and the group Haciendo Punto en Otro Son.|$|E
2500|$|Molly Crabapple {{was born}} Jennifer <b>Caban</b> on September 13 1983 in Far Rockaway, Queens, New York City, New York, on September 13, 1983 to a Puerto Rican {{father and a}} Jewish mother, who was the {{daughter}} of a Belarusian immigrant. Crabapple began drawing at the age of four with guidance from her mother, an illustrator who worked on toy product packaging. At age 12, Crabapple remembers herself as a [...] "snotty goth moppet in a pair of Doc Martens, who blared Hole on her Walkman, drew headless cheerleaders, and read the Marquis de Sade in class". Her school diagnosed her with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and she was expelled from the seventh grade. In high school, Crabapple described herself as [...] "gothy, dorky, and hated". She never liked her given name so she started using the name Molly Crabapple after a boyfriend suggested it reflected her character.|$|E
2500|$|On April 29, 1989, Ruíz fought Sugar [...] "Baby" [...] Rojas to {{determine}} the first super flyweight champion of the newly created World Boxing Organization. Rojas from Colombia was a former WBC champion and entered the fight {{with a record of}} 31-2. Despite his opponent's experience advantage, Ruíz began the offensive by using his speed to land body punches, gaining control of the fight's tempo. In the fourth round, Rojas was injured by several punches to the head, supporting himself against the ropes. Ruíz subsequently began changing his stance to southpaw, using this strategy to open a cut below his opponent's left eye. This style frustrated Rojas, who protested that Ruíz was not engaging in the offensive. This frustration was also expressed against the referee, Stanley Christodoulou, who warned him during the fight. When the contest concluded, the judges awarded Ruíz scores of 117-114, 119-112, and 117-116. This was part of a card that also featured a fight between John John Molina and Juan Laporte. In his first defense, Ruíz defeated Juan [...] "Curie" [...] Carazo by knockout in the first round. On October 21, 1989, he defeated Ángel [...] "Cuso" [...] Rosario by knockout in the twelfth round. Ruíz closed the year by defeating Marcos Claudio in one round. On May 12, 1990, he defeated Richard Picardo in a non-titular contest held in Italy. In his third title defense, Ruíz defeated Wilfredo Vargas by knockout in eight rounds at Juan Pachín Vicéns Auditorium. On November 3, 1990, he traveled to Mexico and defeated local pugilist, Armando Velasco, by unanimous decision. Following this defense, the Puerto Rico Boxing Commission suggested that the WBC should rank Ruíz among the top ten contenders in their ranking, but this request was declined because he held another championship. A fight against Ellyas Pical was proposed for December 20, 1990, but was never organized. Ruíz was expected to be competing in bigger fights shortly, but a unanimous decision loss against José Quirino halted his progress. This loss discarded a planned fight against Scott Olson. The judges gave scores of 112-116, 11-116 and 112-115 for Quirino. Prior to this fight, Freddy Trinidad was incorporated as part of the pugilist's team. Ruíz justified this defeat by claiming that he had over trained, opening a two-month camp instead of the usual 20 days. His next opponent was the IBF super flyweight champion, Robert Quiroga, who won a close majority decision with scores of 114-114 and 113-114 twice. Ruíz was able to score a knockdown in the third round of this contest. Quiroga was originally scheduled to fight another Puerto Rican, Rafael [...] "Baby" [...] <b>Cabán,</b> who had to withdraw because of injury, opening the space to Ruíz. The card which was originally supposed to take place on June 9, 1992, was postponed and ended being held a month later in Las Vegas. Because of the close decision, Ruíz pursued a rematch, receiving support from the president of the IBF's Championship Committee, Bill Brennan.|$|E
