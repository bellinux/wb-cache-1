25|$|I've always {{believed}} that you play to highlight the song, not to highlight the player. The song is all that matters. There are two ways {{you can choose to}} go. You can try to be someone like Eddie Van Halen, who is a great guitarist, a virtuoso. Yet he doesn't make good records because what he plays is totally lost in the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> band's music. Then there are guitar players like Chet Atkins, who weren't out there trying to show themselves off as guitarists per se, but were using the guitar as a tool to make good records. I remember loving Chet's work when I was a kid, but it was only later, when I really listened to his guitar parts, that I realized how much they were a part of the song's fabric, and how much you'd be going 'Oh, that song just isn't working' if they weren't there.|$|E
25|$|It {{may have}} been in the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> ecclesiastical crisis in the Isles that Guðrøðr {{undertook}} his journey to Norway in 1152. Guðrøðr's overseas objective, therefore, {{may have been}} to secure the patronage of a Scandinavian metropolitan willing to protect the Diocese of the Isles. Certainly, Guðrøðr's stay in Norway coincided with the Scandinavian visit of the papal legate Nicholas Breakspeare, Cardinal-Bishop of Albano (died 1159), {{a man who had been}} tasked to create Norwegian and Swedish ecclesiastical provinces in order to further extend the papacy's authority into the northern European periphery. Eventually the newly created Norwegian provincethe Archdiocese of Niðaróssencompassed eleven dioceses within and outwith mainland Norway. One such overseas diocese was that of the Isles, officially incorporated within the province in November 1154. Although Óláfr did not live long enough to witness the latter formality, it is evident that the remarkable overseas statecraft undertaken by Óláfr and Guðrøðr secured their kingdom's ecclesiastical and secular independence from nearby Dublin. The establishment of the Norwegian archdiocese bound outlying Norse territories closer to Norwegian royal power. In effect, the political reality of the Diocese of the Islesits territorial borders and nominal subjection to far-off Norwayappears to have mirrored that of the Kingdom of the Isles.|$|E

500|$|The russet sparrow's vocalisations are {{described}} by most sources as [...] "the sweetest and most musical" [...] of any sparrow. Its basic call is a cheep or chilp, {{similar to that}} of other sparrows. This call is monosyllabic, unlike the house sparrow's chirrup call, and is softer than that of the other sparrows. This call is given as a flight call, or by displaying males. Recorded variations include a chweep given by males at the nest and a trilled cheeep. Sometimes the male strings calls together and sings them in a strident tone, to create a sort of short song, transcribed as cheep chirrup cheeweep or chreet-chreet-chreet. The song is interspersed with sibilant chu-swik notes {{similar to those of the}} white wagtail. A thin swee swee vocalisation not unlike that of an Indian robin has been reported, but the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> call is unrecorded.

500|$|After the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774, the Crimean Khanate, a vassal of the Ottoman Empire, {{formed in}} 1441, was made {{nominally}} independent by the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca in 1774. It was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1783 as the [...] "Taurida Governorate". The demographics of Crimea underwent {{dramatic changes in}} the centuries following the annexation. Prior to its incorporation into Russia, Crimea had been inhabited primarily by the Crimean Tatars, a Turkic people who were predominately Muslim. Empress Catherine the Great gave many of the lands that had been annexed to her advisors and friends. Native inhabitants of these lands were frequently forced out, spawning a large exodus of Tatars to Ottoman-controlled Anatolia. Russian settlers were brought in to colonise the lands that were once occupied by the fleeing Tatars. By 1903, 39.7% of the population of Crimea, excluding the cities Sevastopol and Yeni-Kale, were members of the Russian Orthodox religion. 44.6% were Muslim. In <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> survey, the identifier [...] "Muslim" [...] is synonymous with ethnic Crimean Tatars. Russians constituted {{the majority of the population}} in the two excluded and separately-administered cities. During and directly prior to this time, Crimea became considered the [...] "heart of Russian Romanticism". It was popular with Russians on holiday because of its warm climate and seaside. This association continued into the Soviet period.|$|E

500|$|Jainism {{speaks of}} karmic [...] "dirt", as karma {{is thought to}} be {{manifest}} as very subtle and sensually imperceptible particles pervading the entire universe. They are so small that one space-point—the smallest possible extent of space—contains an infinite number of karmic particles (or quantity of karmic dirt). It is these karmic particles that adhere to the soul and affect its natural potency. This material karma is called dravya karma; and the resultant emotions—pleasure, pain, love, hatred, and so on—experienced by the soul are called bhava karma, psychic karma. [...] The relationship between the material and psychic karma is that of cause and effect. The material karma gives rise to the feelings and emotions in worldly souls, which—in turn—give rise to psychic karma, causing emotional modifications within the soul. These emotions, yet again, result in influx and bondage of fresh material karma. Jains hold that the karmic matter is actually an agent that enables the consciousness to act within the material <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> universe. They are the material carrier of a soul's desire to physically experience this world. When attracted to the consciousness, they are stored in an interactive karmic field called , which emanates from the soul. Thus, karma is a subtle matter surrounding the consciousness of a soul. When these two components—consciousness and ripened karma—interact, the soul experiences life as known in the present material universe.|$|E
500|$|Lynette Porter, in {{her book}} Tarnished Heroes, Charming Villains and Modern Monsters: Science Fiction in Shades of Gray on 21st Century Television {{observed}} that Rose's role [...] "humanizes the Doctor and makes him less alien, not only to other characters, but to the audience". In the first series finale, Rose takes on deadly energies to save the Doctor and planet Earth. Script editor Helen Raynor felt the episode gave Rose a chance to [...] "again be the Doctor’s equal" [...] and [...] "to finally match him with a gesture that is so noble, and strong, and heroic, and clever". Davies describes Rose in the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> scene, and {{the whole of the}} first series, as being [...] "braver than brave and more loyal {{than anyone else in the}} universe". The Doctor repays her loyalty by sacrificing his ninth incarnation in turn to save her; Davies states unequivocally that [...] "he gives his life for her". Elements of Rose's characterisation in the first series were originally different. Paul Abbott was scheduled to write an episode which would have revealed that Rose's entire life had been manipulated by the Doctor in order to mould her into an ideal companion.
