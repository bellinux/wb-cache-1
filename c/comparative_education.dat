500|$|Commenting on the book's survey study, Cowie (British Journal of Educational Studies) [...] {{wrote that}} it was hard to {{ascertain}} Neill's true pedagogical influence when state schools, which constitute the majority of schools, had a poor response rate. He added that the progressive education topics reported to be most influenced by Neill continued to be controversial in 1973. Cowie asked whether challenges to authoritarian education were replaced by Neill's methods or by chaos. Hopkins (<b>Comparative</b> <b>Education</b> Review) said the sociological study was more descriptive of Neill's role than contributive to the evolution of his philosophy. Hopkins wrote that the book functioned best as a biography, and that its philosophy sections were [...] "piecemeal" [...] and [...] "sketchy" [...] rather than [...] "comprehensive and coherent". Indeed, he felt that the study and the philosophical portions were more illuminative of Neill's life than of [...] "any broader picture". Robert B. Nordberg (Best Sellers) appreciated some of the book's [...] "important points", such that many advocates for educational freedom, in practice, instead seek more insidious techniques for controlling children. While Curtis (The Times Literary Supplement) felt that the book added little new content, she appreciated the book's detail, such as that Neill's A Dominie's Log was based in fact, not fiction.|$|E
500|$|Though Hemmings did {{not think}} of his work as a biography, Richard L. Hopkins (<b>Comparative</b> <b>Education</b> Review) said it {{essentially}} was strongest as one. Hopkins wrote in 1976 that Hemmings's book was the best biography of Neill available at the time, and called it [...] "comprehensive", [...] "objective", and [...] "sympathetically thoughtful". In comparison, Neill's autobiography [...] "rambles" [...] and Skidelsky's biography [...] "preens" [...] over [...] "small insights", while Hemmings unpacks larger issues to contextualize [...] "a complex man in a complex world". Reflecting on these three biographies of Neill, Hopkins added that Hemmings's book would interest [...] "comparative educators" [...] most, as that it addressed the two points readers would find most interesting about Neill: the role of his history on his ideas, and the role of his ideas in the outside world. Still, Hopkins thought many readers would find the work [...] "too long and detailed". Hopkins himself found Hemmings's book [...] "a struggle to work through", though more complete compared to Neill's [...] "easy", [...] "stream-of-consciousness" [...] prose. Leonard W. Cowie (British Journal of Educational Studies) said that Fifty Years was written with [...] "great competence" [...] and would be both [...] "interesting and essential" [...] for those interested in understanding Neill. [...] recommended the [...] "excellent volume" [...] for [...] "all readership levels", and considered it more telling than Neill's own autobiography. Shelley Neiderbach (Library Journal) agreed that Hemmings's [...] "admiring ... historical biography" [...] remained [...] "clear, cool, and evenhanded". [...] Sarah Curtis (The Times Literary Supplement) wrote in 1972 that Hemmings's account of Neill was [...] "the most lucid, dispassionate yet sympathetic" [...] published. No system, she wrote, has reconciled the needs for individual freedom and societal regulation.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{begins with}} my own bicultural {{experiences}} {{in the context of}} adult education and language teaching and examines current issues in <b>comparative</b> adult <b>education</b> in light of the challenges imposed by increasing globalisation and lifelong learning. The first chapter ends with research questions about the validity of <b>comparative</b> adult <b>education</b> given that hitherto theoretical approaches have, it seems, ceased to be part of scholarly debates in adult continuing education. The following chapter proceeds to explore research methods appropriate to this study, which are based on approaches in phenomenology and constructivism, and which are explored further in chapter 8 in the context of <b>comparative</b> adult <b>education.</b> The study then seeks to challenge the appropriacy of comparing systems of adult education within the positivist paradigm which, it is argued, has stifled debates and not enabled alternative approaches to develop. Furthermore, it is argued that bounded concepts of nation states and national characteristics are no longer relevant {{in the context of a}} multicultural and multilingual Europe. Adult educators are increasingly engaged in intercultural activities by taking part in professional networks and EU-sponsored programmes, computer-mediated or not (discussed in chapter 5). These activities demand skills in cross- and intercultural communication and, in comparative terms, an understanding of different cultural communities. Chapter 6, therefore, looks at the role of language and interculturality which, it is argued, are fundamental to <b>comparative</b> adult <b>education.</b> Issues in relation to lifelong learning are explored further in the subsequent chapter with regard to Germany and Britain and the respective historical, structural and cultural contexts. Chapter 8 argues that <b>comparative</b> adult <b>education</b> can only be meaningful if new meaning and knowledge are constructed on the basis of intercultural communication and shared comparative reflection. This chapter also outlines a new theoretical framework, which, it is proposed, is appropriate to <b>comparative</b> adult <b>education</b> in its contemporary post- or late modem context. The questions raised in opening chapter are answered in the final chapter with the conclusion that there is, after all, validity in undertaking research in <b>comparative</b> adult <b>education</b> and that it is an exciting and stimulating field of study...|$|R
