5000|$|ROLM Corporation, {{founded in}} 1969 by Gene Richeson, Ken Oshman, Walter Loewenstern and Robert Maxfield, {{was the first}} PBX {{manufacturer}} to offer integrated voice-mail with its PhoneMail system, its registered trademark. PhoneMail offered impressive recording quality of its digitized messages. ROLM's digital PBX (called a CBX, for <b>Computerized</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>eXchange)</b> {{was the first to}} enable PhoneMail to illuminate a message waiting light on ROLM phones equipped with message waiting lights (also a stutter dialtone is used with analog and digital phones). Rolm was sold to IBM, who later sold it to Siemens who offer PhoneMail in various configurations/sizes (including a micro-sized version) and its unified messaging successor, Xpressions 470. ROLM was purchased by IBM in the mid 1980s (which was a financial disaster for the profitable ROLM, as IBM clearly could not grasp the laid back, [...] "think outside the box" [...] attitude of ROLM, which was the #2 PBX supplier in the US from the mid 70s to late 80s), then sold half interest to the German company Siemens. In 1992, Siemens bought ROLM entirely from IBM and the original ROLM product line was done for, except for PhoneMail (the only product Siemens did not destroy). VMX suffered from poor product and ineffective management and was about to fold when Opcom merged with it. The surviving company was called VMX, but VMX was all but erased by Opcom except for its name and patent portfolio.|$|E

It demonstrates an orderly process through which a medium-sized organization can transform a complex telecommunication environment into a progressive and self-reliant telecommunication utility. The process of planning private telecommunications systems is discussed in detail with an emphasis placed on the comparative evaluation of <b>computerized</b> <b>branch</b> <b>exchanges</b> (CPBX) and local area networks (LAN). This study shows that a <b>computerized</b> private <b>branch</b> <b>exchange</b> is preferable to a local area network in a medium-sized organization in general. Lieutenant, Hellenic Nav...|$|R
40|$|Many NASA {{centers have}} {{selected}} ROLM(TM) <b>Computerized</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Exchanges</b> (CBX's) as their standard telephone exchange. The ROLM 9751 CBX Model 70 with ROLM software release 9005 can inter-communicate as a 'multi-node' system over a multimode fiber optic link of 450 to 6, 000 meters. Singlemode fiber installations are {{not supported by}} ROLM. Two New Mexico-based NASA satellite ground terminals were already connected via a 6 kilometer singlemode fiber optic link. The ROLM Inter-Node Link (INL) was converted from multimode LED transmitters to singlemode laser transmitters and two ROLM CBX systems were interconnected using the modified INL. On activation, the system operated normally and has done so for six months. System testing indicates sufficient margin to drive 45 kilometers of singlemode fiber, an important benefit for widely separated facilities...|$|R
5000|$|The Telecom {{division}} leveraged the 1603 processor {{into the}} heart of its original CBX. Over time, the company began to focus on digital voice, and produced some of the earliest examples of all-digital voice equipment, including <b>Computerized</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Exchanges</b> (CBXs) and digital phones. Two of the most popular telecom systems were the ROLM CBX and ROLM Redwood (PBX and Key Systems Unit (KSU) models, respectively). The CBX was meant to directly compete with Northern Telecom's SL-1, AT&T Dimension telephone systems and other computerized digital-voice systems being developed at the time. By 1980, ROLM had shot past AT&T in number of systems deployed to become the #2 PBX in North America. The Redwood, often called the [...] "Deadwood" [...] by many ROLM techs because it never caught on, was intended to compete with the Nortel Norstar Key System. When Siemens bought ROLM from IBM and introduced their [...] "newer" [...] models, which were renamed Siemens switches, the early ROLM phone switches were widely pressed into service as old technology (though a number of 8000 and 9751-9005 CBXs remain online at some companies), but the digital phone handsets were quite valuable for those expanding their phone networks. The later ROLM 9200 (actually a Siemens HCM200 Hybrid system renamed) was more competition for the leading Key Systems as the 9200 had intensive Least Call Routing software, which the Redwood did not. The company also produced one of the first commercially successful voicemail systems, PhoneMail. Digital ROLM telephones, called ROLMphones, were unique from other telephones in many ways, one of which was a lack of a physical switchhook button. Instead, the handset contains a small magnet which triggers a switch in the phone base. The opening or closing of this switch lets the phone and system know if the phone is on hook (not in use) or off-hook (in use).|$|R

50|$|The term PBX {{originated}} when switchboard operators managed company switchboards manually using cord circuits.

40|$|Abstract â€” We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to the problem of logical topology reconfiguration in congested WDM networks using simulation-based multi-time scale Markov Decision Processes (MDP). Previous work considered total reconfiguration of the network, <b>branch</b> <b>exchanges</b> or addition and deletion of lightpaths when the traffic pattern changes. However, the special case when {{all or part of the}} network is congested has not been studied in detail before. We demonstrate that our approach performs well in both uncongested and congested regimes. We restrict the actions taken in reconfiguring the network to <b>branch</b> <b>exchanges</b> to limit the effect of reconfigurations on the number of dropped calls. At each time step a list of possible <b>branch</b> <b>exchanges</b> is formed, and using a heuristic algorithm this (usually long) list is trimmed down to a more manageable list. We use the MDP model to predict the traffic, and then a simulation based online algorithm is used to select one of the <b>branch</b> <b>exchanges</b> as the next action. We apply a policy improvement method to the heuristic policy to obtain a better policy than the heuristic policy...|$|R

50|$|The {{electromechanical}} {{automatic telephone}} exchange, invented by Almon Strowger in 1888, gradually replaced manual switchboards in central telephone exchanges around the world.

Nevertheless, many manual <b>branch</b> <b>exchanges</b> remained operational into {{the second half of}} the 20th century in many enterprises. Later electronic devices and computer technology gave the operator access to an abundance of features. A private <b>branch</b> <b>exchange</b> (PBX) in a business usually has an attendant console for the operator, or an auto-attendant, which bypasses the operator entirely.|$|R
