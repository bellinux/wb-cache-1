5|$|Finally, {{before leaving}} Mecca, pilgrims perform a {{farewell}} tawaf called the Tawaf al-Wadaa. 'Wadaa' means 'to bid farewell'. The pilgrims <b>circle</b> <b>the</b> Kaaba seven times counter-clockwise, {{and if they}} can, attempt to touch or kiss the Kaaba.|$|E
5|$|Muslim pilgrims <b>circle</b> <b>the</b> Kaaba {{as a part}} of the tawaf ritual {{during the}} hajj and many try to stop and kiss the Black Stone, emulating the kiss that Islamic {{tradition}} records that it received from Muhammad.|$|E
50|$|The {{plus sign}} in k = ±1/r applies to a circle that is {{externally}} tangent to <b>the</b> other <b>circles,</b> like <b>the</b> three black <b>circles</b> in <b>the</b> image. For an internally tangent <b>circle</b> like <b>the</b> big red <b>circle,</b> that circumscribes <b>the</b> other <b>circles,</b> <b>the</b> minus sign applies.|$|R
50|$|In a few <b>Circles,</b> <b>the</b> {{office of}} <b>Circle</b> Captain / Circle Colonel (Kreisobrist) was created: a {{military}} leader appointed {{for the long}} term. In some <b>Circles</b> <b>the</b> office of <b>Circle</b> General was created. He was appointed by <b>the</b> <b>Circle</b> for <b>the</b> management of its troops, {{and he and his}} staff, as well as the regimental commanders, were paid from <b>the</b> <b>Circle's</b> budget. <b>The</b> appointment and payment of the remaining officers was sometimes carried out by <b>the</b> <b>Circles</b> and sometimes by the Imperial Estates providing the contingents of troops.|$|R

5|$|Baron Cohen won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. He {{received}} equivalent awards {{from the}} San Francisco Film Critics <b>Circle,</b> <b>the</b> Utah Film Critics Association, the Toronto Film Critics Association, and the Online Film Critics Society. The Los Angeles Film Critics Association tied Baron Cohen with Forest Whitaker in The Last King of Scotland for their title of Best Actor. Baron Cohen was also nominated for Best Actor by the London Film Critics’ Circle.|$|E
5|$|Chauvel's envelopment was {{extended}} at 09:25, when Chaytor ordered a regiment to <b>circle</b> <b>the</b> entrenched positions and move through Aulad Ali, {{to cut off}} a possible line of retreat {{to the south and}} south east. The 10th Light Horse Regiment with two sections of the brigade Machine Gun Squadron, led by Brigadier General J. R. Royston, commander of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, succeeded in capturing Aulad Ali and 300 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|During combat, {{the player}} can <b>circle</b> <b>the</b> enemy to expose weak points and escape {{dangerous}} positions. Changing position temporarily stops the gauges charging. Likewise, enemies may change position {{to force the}} dragon into vulnerable areas; a radar {{at the bottom of}} the screen indicates safe, neutral and dangerous areas, with the front and rear areas typically posing the most danger. Weak points can sometimes only be attacked from dangerous areas, and enemies' attack patterns often change mid-battle, forcing the player to adapt.|$|E
5000|$|The radical axis (or power line) of two <b>circles</b> is <b>the</b> {{locus of}} points at which tangents drawn to both <b>circles</b> have <b>the</b> same length. The radical axis is always a {{straight}} line and always perpendicular to the line connecting the centers of <b>the</b> <b>circles,</b> albeit closer to the circumference of <b>the</b> larger <b>circle.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>circles</b> intersect, <b>the</b> radical axis is the line passing through the intersection points; similarly, if <b>the</b> <b>circles</b> are tangent, <b>the</b> radical axis is simply the common tangent.|$|R

5|$|Even {{with all}} the success, or because of it, he was resented among some of Johnson's circle. Hawkins, member of Johnson's second club, the Literary Club {{established}} 1764, resigned over a dispute with others of Johnson's <b>circle.</b> <b>The</b> relationship between Hawkins {{and the rest of}} Johnson's friends became so tense that many criticised Johnson for choosing Hawkins in 1784 as one of his executors for his will. However, within hours of Johnson's death, Thomas Cadell and William Strahan asked Hawkins to write a biography and an edition of Johnson's literary works.|$|E
5|$|Geological {{evidence}} shows the Thera volcano erupted numerous times over {{several hundred thousand}} years before the Minoan eruption. In a repeating process, the volcano would violently erupt, then eventually collapse into a roughly circular seawater-filled caldera, with numerous small islands forming the <b>circle.</b> <b>The</b> caldera would slowly refill with magma, building a new volcano, which erupted and then collapsed in an ongoing cyclical process.|$|E
50|$|In geometry, Descartes' theorem {{states that}} for every four kissing, or {{mutually}} tangent, <b>circles,</b> <b>the</b> radii of <b>the</b> <b>circles</b> satisfy a certain quadratic equation. By solving this equation, one can construct a fourth circle tangent to three given, mutually tangent <b>circles.</b> <b>The</b> theorem is named after René Descartes, who stated it in 1643.|$|R
50|$|Traffic {{generally}} follows roundabout rules, i.e., traffic inside <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> has <b>the</b> right-of-way {{and traffic}} entering <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> must yield. However, {{there are also}} traffic lights and stop signs regulating traffic flow and the I-395 off-ramps enter <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> from <b>the</b> interior of <b>the</b> <b>circle,</b> requiring a left merge into <b>the</b> traffic <b>circle.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Intuitively speaking, {{this means}} that a closed path that <b>circles</b> <b>the</b> torus' [...] "hole" [...] (say, a circle that traces out a {{particular}} latitude) and then <b>circles</b> <b>the</b> torus' [...] "body" [...] (say, a circle that traces out a particular longitude) can be deformed to a path that <b>circles</b> <b>the</b> body and then the hole. So, strictly 'latitudinal' and strictly 'longitudinal' paths commute. This might be imagined as two shoelaces passing through each other, then unwinding, then rewinding.|$|R
5|$|Over the Bering Sea, {{the three}} B-29s {{maintained}} radio contact with each other, communicating positions hourly as they navigated independently. Near the Arctic <b>Circle,</b> <b>the</b> magnetic compasses fluctuated wildly, and the fliers ignored them, relying {{instead on the}} radio compass. In Number 2, the radio compass stopped working as well, but it resumed working later in the flight.|$|E
5|$|Route 77 crosses into Upper Pittsgrove Township, Salem County, {{where it}} becomes Pole Tavern-Bridgeton Road, and crosses CR 611 in Shirley. It {{continues}} north through farms to Pole Tavern, where Route 77 meets US 40, CR 604, and CR 635 at the Pole Tavern Circle. Past the Pole Tavern <b>Circle,</b> <b>the</b> route becomes Bridgeton Pike and crosses CR 660. Before leaving Salem County, Route 77 intersects two more county routes: CR 619 and CR 666.|$|E
5|$|Some {{eukaryotic}} cells, {{such as the}} protist Euglena, {{also have}} flagella, but eukaryotic flagella do not rotate at the base; rather, they bend {{in such a way}} that the tip of the flagellum whips in a <b>circle.</b> <b>The</b> eukaryotic flagellum, also called a cilium or undulipodium, is structurally and evolutionarily distinct from prokaryotic flagella.|$|E
50|$|Archimedes {{had already}} proved {{as the first}} {{proposition}} of Measurement of a <b>Circle</b> that <b>the</b> area of a circle is equal to a right-angled triangle having the legs' lengths equal to the radius of <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> and <b>the</b> circumference of <b>the</b> <b>circle.</b> So <b>the</b> area of <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> with radius OP {{is equal to the}} area of the triangle OPT.|$|R
50|$|For instance, <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> and <b>the</b> {{line are}} very {{different}} objects. One cannot stretch <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> {{to look like the}} line, nor compress the line to fit on <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> without gaps or overlaps. However, a small piece of <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> can be stretched and flattened out to look like a small piece of the line. For this reason, one may say that <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> and <b>the</b> line are locally equivalent.|$|R
50|$|The Apollonius {{problem is}} the problem of {{constructing}} a circle tangent to three given circles in a plane. In general, there are eight circles touching three given <b>circles.</b> <b>The</b> <b>circle</b> E referred to in the above definition is one of these eight <b>circles</b> touching <b>the</b> three excircles of triangle ABC. In Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> E is <b>the</b> called <b>the</b> Apollonius <b>circle</b> of triangle ABC.|$|R
5|$|The 72nd Battalion would <b>circle</b> <b>the</b> {{position}} {{by the south}} to join the Jerusalem road {{at the level of}} Bab al-Wad; it would then cross the road and climb the ridges to take Dayr Ayyub, Yalu and Bayt Nuba, and would ambush there to cover the passage of convoys. It would be supported by three armored cars and two half-tracks of the 73rd Battalion.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{setting for}} the series was the 28th century. Humanity has discovered the means of travelling instantaneously through time and space. The capital of Earth, Galaxity, is {{the centre of the}} vast Terran Galactic Empire. Earth itself has become a virtual utopia with most of the population living a life of leisure in a virtual reality dream-state ruled by the benign Technocrats of the First <b>Circle.</b> <b>The</b> Spatio-Temporal Service protects the planets of the Terran Empire and guards against temporal paradoxes caused by rogue time-travellers. Valérian and Laureline are two such spatio-temporal agents.|$|E
5|$|The table {{does not}} include the {{numerous}} whaling voyages that took place during this period, or sub-Antarctic expeditions such as that of Carl Chun in 1898–99, which did not penetrate the Antarctic <b>circle.</b> <b>The</b> abortive Cope Expedition of 1920–22, which collapsed through lack of funding, is likewise excluded, though two men were landed from a Norwegian whaler and spent a year on the Antarctic peninsula.|$|E
50|$|When {{counting}} {{the total number}} of turns, counterclockwise motion counts as positive, while clockwise motion counts as negative.

5|$|Withypool Stone Circle {{is located}} on the {{south-western}} slope of Withypool Hill, with some sources referring to it as Withypool Hill Stone <b>Circle.</b> <b>The</b> site is at a height of 381 meters (1250 feet) above sea level. It is 670.25 meters (733 yards) east-southeast of Portford Bridge, and two and three-quarter miles south/south-west of Exford.|$|E
5|$|Although Exmoor {{witnessed}} {{the construction of}} a large number of monuments during the Bronze Age, only two stone circles survive in this area, the other being Porlock Stone <b>Circle.</b> <b>The</b> Withypool ring is located on the south-western slope of Withypool Hill, on an area of heathland. In diameter it measures 36.4 metres (119 feet, 6 inches) across. Around thirty small gritstones remain as part of the circle, which may originally have held around one hundred; there are conspicuous gaps on the northern and western ends of the monument. The site was rediscovered in 1898 and subsequently surveyed by the archaeologist Harold St George Gray in 1905.|$|E
5|$|American Beauty was not {{considered}} an immediate favorite to dominate the American awards season. Several other contenders opened {{at the end of}} 1999, and US critics spread their honors among them when compiling their end-of-year lists. The Chicago Film Critics Association and the Broadcast Film Critics Association named the film the best of 1999, but while the New York Film Critics <b>Circle,</b> <b>the</b> National Society of Film Critics and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association recognized American Beauty, they gave their top awards to other films. By the end of the year, reports of a critical backlash suggested American Beauty was the underdog in the race for Best Picture; however, at the Golden Globe Awards in January 2000, American Beauty won Best Film, Best Director and Best Screenplay.|$|E
