50|$|The {{concept for}} what became Federal Express came to Fred Smith in the mid-1960s, {{while he was}} {{studying}} as an undergraduate student at Yale University. For a class there, he submitted a paper which argued that in modern technological society time meant money {{more than ever before}} and with the advent of miniaturized electronic circuitry, very small components had become extremely valuable. He argued that the consumer society was becoming increasingly hungry for mass-produced electronic items, but the decentralizing effect induced by these very devices gave manufacturers tremendous logistic problems in delivering the items. Smith felt that the necessary delivery speed could only be achieved by using air transport. But he believed that the U.S. air cargo system was so inflexible and bound by regulations at that time that it was completely incapable of making sufficiently fast deliveries. Plus, the U.S. air cargo industry was highly unsuited to the role. Its system depended on <b>cooperation</b> <b>between</b> <b>companies,</b> as interlining was often necessary to get a consignment from point A to point B, and the industry relied heavily on cargo forwarders to fill hold space and perform doorstep deliveries.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAccording to {{interviews}} with experts from automotive industry, {{one of the}} main changes in the future automotive development will be the entry of new disciplines.

For supporting the automotive development in the future environment like mentioned above, the IPEK has implemented a new validation concept based on its X-in-the-Loop-Framework. “X” is the substitution for the system under development (SUD), which is validated under consideration of the influences from the remaining system, user and environmental situation. The new validation concept is characterized by a “Distance Loop”, which means the SUD and other elements can be located across the globe. The advantages of the new validation concept are demonstrated in this paper with concrete application examples based on an international collaborative project...|$|R
