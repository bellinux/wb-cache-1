The {{aim of this}} research was to study whether the bioavailability of zidovudine can be improved by AZT-SLNs perorally to rats as compared to oral administration of zidovudine. Zidovudine was determined in plasma and tissues by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The pharmacokinetic parameters of zidovudine were determined after peroral administration: area under <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentration</b> versus time (AUC) for AZT-SLNs was 31. 25 % greater than AZT solution; meanwhile mean resident time (MRT) was found to be 1. 83 times higher for AZT-SLNs than AZT solution. Elimination half life of zidovudine was also increased for SLN formulation. Tissue distribution pattern of zidovudine was changed in case of AZT-SLNs. AUC of zidovudine in brain and liver was found to be approximately 2. 73 and 1. 77 times higher in AZT-SLNs than AZT solution, respectively, indicating that AZT-SLNs could cross blood brain barrier. Distribution of zidovudine was approximately 0. 95 and 0. 86 times lesser in heart and kidney, respectively. It can be concluded from the study that oral administration of AZT-SLNs modifies the plasma pharmacokinetic parameters and biodistribution of zidovudine...|$|E
40|$|Elevated {{concentrations}} of cytokines {{were found in}} the plasma of patients acutely ill with Reye syndrome (RS) but not in control subjects or recovered RS patients. To determine whether this disorder involves a genetically determined abnormal response to cytokines, the effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL- 1 on intracellular free Ca 2 + were compared in cultured skin fibroblasts from control subjects and patients with RS. IL- 1 and TNF caused rapid, transient, and concentration-dependent increases in cytosolic free Ca 2 +. The peak cytosolic free Ca 2 + was greater and occurred at higher {{concentrations of}} IL- 1 and TNF in patient cells than in cells from age-matched controls. In control cells, the Ca 2 + transient diminished sharply with increasing amounts of IL- 1 or TNF above the maximum stimulatory concentration. In contrast, in patient fibroblast this bell-shaped <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentration</b> dependency was much less apparent. Bradykinin-stimulated Ca 2 + transients were similar in the two groups and did not exhibit the bell-shaped concentration dependency. Thus, plasma cytokine levels are elevated in RS patients and the Ca 2 + response to cytokines is increased in cells derived from these patients. We propose that the increased response reflects a genetic defect in cytokine receptor-modulated signal transduction...|$|E

Experiments {{were performed to}} determine the <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentration</b> of free amino acid in the blood after intraperitoneal administration of the labeled proline. Radioautographs were quantitatively analyzed and the concentration of isotope, in grains per unit area, was determined for the following cellular and extracellular compartments: ergastoplasm, Golgi complex, peripheral cytoplasmic structures, and collagen. The concentration of label, expressed as number of grains per unit area of each subcellular system, reveals the period during which each cellular compartment is maximally labeled, and presents {{a clearer picture of}} the passage of the label through each of these compartments. The data demonstrate appearance of the label at maximum concentration in the ergastoplasm 15 minutes after injection, and this compartment remains maximally labeled for 2 hours. In the Golgi complex, concentration is not maximal until 60 minutes after injection of isotope, and appears to decrease before or at about the same rate as that of the ergastoplasm. The present experiment is consistent with previous light microscope radioautographic studies, and no storage phase was found in the fibroblasts. The findings are not simply consistent with a direct precursor-product relationship between the contents of the ergastoplasm and those of the Golgi complex. Morphologic observations of regions in the fibroblast interpretable as possible sites of communication between the ergastoplasm and the extracellular space, together with the kinetic studies, permit the suggestion of an alternate pathway of passage of {{at least some of the}} synthesized protein directly from the ergastoplasmic cisternae to the cell exterior...|$|E

The plasma disposition of marbofloxacin was best described by a tri-compartmental for intravenous and a bicompartmental open model with first-order for intramuscular dosing. The Peak plasma concentration (Cmax of 39. 80 ± 11, 29 mg/ 1 was reached at (Tma×) 1, 16 ± 0, 460 h after intamuscular administration.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of uptake of anthocyanins (as {{well as the}} type) from food in the intestine is not clear. Anthocyanin-rich extract from wild mulberry, composed of cyanidin- 3 -glucoside (79 %) and cyanidin- 3 -rutino side (cy- 3 -rut) (19 %), was orally administered to Wistar rats, and their concentrations were determined in plasma, kidney, and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The 2 glycosylated forms showed maximum concentration at 15 minutes after oral administration, both in plasma and kidney. The cyanidin- 3 -glucoside and cy- 3 -rut were found in plasma as glucuronides, as sulfates of cyanidin, and as unchanged forms. The area under the <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentration</b> vs time (AUC(0 - 8 h)) was 2. 76 +/- 0. 88 mu g hour/mL and 9. 74 +/- 0. 75 mu g hour/g for plasma and kidney, respectively. In spite of the low absorption, the increase in plasma anthocyanin level resulted in {{a significant increase in}} antioxidant capacity (P <. 05). In the GI tract (stomach and small and large intestines), cyanidin glycosides were found unchanged, but a low amount of the aglycone form was present. Anthocyanin glycosides were no longer detected in the GI tract after 8 hours of administration. In vitro fermentation showed that the 2 cyanidin glycosides were totally metabolized by the rat colonic microflora, explaining their disappearance. In addition, the 2 products of their degradation, cyanidin and protocatechuic acid, were not detected in plasma and probably do not influence plasma antioxidant capacity. As found by the everted sac model, anthocyanins were transported across the enterocyte by the sodium-dependent glucose transporter. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

However, the suitability of quantitative EtG measurements in hair to determine the quantity of alcohol consumed has not clearly been demonstrated yet. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the influence of ethanol dose and hair pigmentation on the incorporation of EtG into rat hair. Ethanol and EtG kinetics in blood were investigated after a single administration of ethanol. Eighteen rats were divided into four groups receiving 0 (control group), 1, 2, or 3 g ethanol/kg body weight. Ethanol was administered on 4 consecutive days per week for 3 weeks by intragastric route. Twenty-eight days after the initial ethanol administration, newly grown hair was shaved. Pigmented and nonpigmented hair were analyzed separately by gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Blood samples were collected within 12 h after the ethanol administration. EtG and ethanol blood levels were measured by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry and headspace gas chromatography-flame ionization detector, respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed in EtG concentrations between pigmented and nonpigmented hair (Spearman's rho= 0. 95). Thus, EtG incorporation into rat hair was not affected by hair pigmentation. Higher doses of ethanol resulted in greater blood ethanol area under the <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentration</b> versus time (AUC) and in greater blood EtG AUC. A positive correlation was found between blood ethanol AUC and blood EtG AUC (Spearman's rho= 0. 84). Increased ethanol administration was associated with an increased EtG concentration in hair. Blood ethanol AUC was correlated with EtG concentration in hair (Pearson's r= 0. 89). EtG concentration in rat hair appeared to reflect the EtG concentration in blood. Ethanol was metabolized at a median rate of 0. 22 g/kg/h, and the median elimination half-life of EtG was 1. 21 h. This study supports that the bloodstream is likely to display a major role in the hair EtG incorporation...|$|E

A biphasic disappearance pattern with a rapid distribution phase was observed in the <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentration</b> in plasma versus time. Pharmacokinetic analysis based on a two-compartment model with elimination from the central compartment yielded the following parameters for male rats (mean +/-standard deviation, n = 3) : elimination half-life was 108 +/- 7 min, apparent volume of distribution of the central compartment was 397 +/- 44 mL. kg- 1, the plasma clearance was 32 +/- 4 mL. min- 1. kg- 1, and the apparent volume of distribution at steady state was 2. 29 +/- 0. 25 L. kg- 1. No significant difference (analysis of variance p value > 0. 25) {{was found in the}} pharmacokinetic data between male and female rats. An extremely fast absorption was found after intraperitoneal administration. Maximal concentrations in plasma were often observed at the first time point 5 min after dosing.

An increase of the elimination half-life of at least 40 % for male rats and 300 % for female rats was observed, indicating dose-dependent kinetics after intraperitoneal administration. After oral dosing, levels of 1 in plasma were extremely low and often below the quantitation limit of the assay (10 pmol. mL- 1). This did not allow detailed kinetic analysis. Even in the more favorable cases, the bioavailability did not exceed 0. 5 %.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{association}} {{in a group}} of battery manufacturing workers between computerised postural sway parameters and present <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> blood lead (PPb), index of cumulative blood lead years (CBI), and cumulative blood lead at different years of exposure (CPbYs). METHODS: Postural stability was investigated with a computerised postural sway measurement system in 60 workers exposed to lead with exposure duration of 84 (range 3 - 366) months and in 60 control subjects. An index of CBIs in 55 workers (previous blood lead results of five workers were not available) and CPbYs were computed for each worker by calculating the area under the <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> blood lead against time. RESULTS: The mean (SD) PPb was 36. 0 (11. 7) (range 6. 4 to 64. 5) micrograms/dl for the exposed workers and 6. 3 (2. 4) (range 3. 1 - 10. 9) micrograms/dl for the 14 randomly selected control subjects. Significant differences between groups for the postural sway parameters obtained when the eyes were closed were found for length of sway path (L); mean velocity of the centre of pressure along its path (Vel); area included within the path of the centre of pressure (Ao); 95 % confidence elliptical area (Ae). The Romberg ratio (the relation between eyes closed and open) for the Vel, L, Ao, and Ae of the exposed group were also significantly {{different from those of the}} controls. The postural sway parameters (eyes closed) were not significantly correlated with PPb or CBI. However, the cumulative blood lead for the past two years before the postural sway assessment, CPbY 2, was significantly correlated with all the postural sway parameters. CONCLUSION: The study showed that workers exposed to lead had significantly poorer postural stability than a control group. Lead may affect certain parts of the somatosensory system resulting in postural instability when the visual input is cut off. The CPbY 2 was significantly positively correlated with most of the postural sway parameters. Effects of lead on postural stability may be related to recent increases in blood lead concentration among the exposed workers rather than to cumulative body burden...|$|R
50|$|A {{diphenylamine}} (DPA) indicator will {{confirm the}} presence of DNA. This procedure involves chemical hydrolysis of DNA: when heated (e.g. ≥95 °C) in acid, the reaction requires a deoxyribose sugar and therefore is specific for DNA. Under these conditions, the 2-deoxyribose is converted to w-hydroxylevulinyl aldehyde, which reacts with the compound, diphenylamine, to produce a blue-colored compound. DNA concentration can be determined measuring the intensity of absorbance of the solution at the 600 nm with a spectrophotometer and comparing to a standard <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> known DNA <b>concentrations.</b>|$|R
