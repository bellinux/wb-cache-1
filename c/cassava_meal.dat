40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{proximate}} and physicochemical {{properties of}} cassava leaf and peel meals were evaluated {{with a view}} to possible replacement of wheat offal which is the conventional source of fibre in animal feed, with these meals. The effect of feeds produced with cassava leaf and peel meals on the performance of growing snails was also investigated. Feeds (F 1, F 2 and F 3) were formulated to contain 240, 235 and 230 g/kg <b>cassava</b> root <b>meal</b> each and 85, 85 and 90 g/kg <b>cassava</b> peel <b>meal,</b> wheat offal <b>meal</b> and <b>cassava</b> leaf <b>meal</b> respectively. The formulated feeds contain approximately 18. 0 % crude protein, 7. 5 % ash, 3 % fat, 6. 0 % crude fibre 8 %, calcium, 0. 7 % phosphorus, and energy level of 2400 kcal ME / kg. A total of 54 growing snails (Archachatina marginata) were used to investigate the nutritive potential of the formulated feeds on performance of growing snails for 15 weeks. Concentrations of the crude protein, crude fat, crude fibre, ash and calcium in <b>cassava</b> leaf <b>meal</b> were higher than those of wheat offal and <b>cassava</b> peel <b>meal,</b> with the exception of nitrogen free extract which was highest (70. 01 %) in <b>cassava</b> peel <b>meal.</b> Feed intake was 576 g 569 g and 581 g for snails fed with <b>cassava</b> leaf <b>meal,</b> <b>cassava</b> peel <b>meal</b> and wheat offal respectively but the corresponding weight gain ranged between 123. 35 and 134. 81 % being highest for F 1. The feed conversion ratio shows that F 1 >F 3 >F 2 indicating better conversion of feed to edible meat in F 1. The results show that cassava leaves and peels have a strong potential to substitute the traditional wheat offal and can therefore be adapted as commercial feed ingredients...|$|R

The diets were neither iso-nitrogenous nor iso-caloric. Sixteen growing pigs of an average range 12. 0 to 12. 5 kg were randomly allocated to 4 dietary treatments in a completely randomized fashion with each treatment replicated twice. The diet containing 0 % <b>cassava</b> peel <b>meal</b> (control diet) was tagged diet I and fed to pigs in treatment I while diets containing 10, 20 and 30 % <b>cassava</b> peel <b>meal,</b> tagged diets 2, 3 and 4, respectively were fed to pigs in treatments 2, 3 and 4, respectively.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsVincent R. Amanor-BoaduMaize is {{a staple}} food to many Zambians. It {{is for this}} reason that it has {{received}} a lot of support from government as a way of maintaining food security in the nation. No other crop in Zambia currently receives such level of support from government. Factors influencing its availability can thus seriously affect food security. In recent years, Zambia has not been spared by adverse climatic changes that have continued to affect the entire globe. In the early 1980 s the southern “maize-belt” part of the country that was devastated by continuous drought that caused villagers to go hungry and lose a lot of livestock that was their main livelihood. The trend of decreasing rainfall in consecutive seasons has continued in many parts of the country. Because most smallholder farmers, who are the major contributors to the nation’s food supply, depend on rain for crop production, there has been a deliberate policy by government through the Ministry of Agriculture and Co-operatives to encourage the farmers to diversify their on- and off-farm activities to improve food security at household and national level. To this end, the government has continued to encourage the growing of cassava. Several studies have suggested that cassava is a nutritious food crop (Chitundu, Droppelman and Haggblade, 2006). Cassava has a number of industrial uses too. Good attributes of cassava lie not only in the nutrition content of the tuber and leaves but also in the fact that as a field crop it does not require expensive inputs like fertilizer and is better able to withstand drought compared to the maize crop. This study attempts to understand the economic factors that influence consumption of cassava to shed light on its potential to avert potential crisis associated with prolonged droughts. Based on the survey conducted in 2007 in Lusaka, the study found that price and quality of <b>cassava</b> <b>meal</b> are the principal determinants of <b>cassava</b> <b>meal</b> demand in Lusaka. Direct price elasticity of demand for cassava is - 1. 32, suggesting that <b>cassava</b> <b>meal</b> is price elastic. The study also found that the cross price elasticity between maize meal price and <b>cassava</b> <b>meal</b> demand is 0. 04 suggesting that <b>cassava</b> <b>meal</b> is a substitute to maize meal, but inelastic. The income price elasticity of demand for <b>cassava</b> <b>meal</b> is - 0. 12. However, income was found to be statistically insignificant in determining the demand for <b>cassava</b> <b>meal.</b> As such these economic factors are keys to the consumption of cassava. Therefore, the study suggests that the demand for <b>cassava</b> <b>meal</b> in Zambia may be improved through deliberate promotion...|$|E

The survey indicated that, in total, 22 feed ingredients were used by the farmers. The main ingredients were <b>cassava</b> root <b>meal,</b> rice bran, <b>cassava</b> residue, groundnut <b>meal,</b> soybean meal and fish meal. Furthermore, several more unconventional feedstuffs were also commonly used, such as <b>cassava</b> leaves, coconut <b>meal,</b> shrimp head meal, sesame husk and squid by-product. The combination of ingredients used in farm-made fish feeds varied among farms and districts leading to a large variation of nutrient composition and energy content. The fish yield varied among districts and ranged from 0. 8 to 6. 5 t ha- 1. The digestibility trial showed that the apparent digestibility (AD) of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM) and crude protein (CP) in <b>cassava</b> leaf <b>meal</b> was significantly lower than in groundnut meal, soybean meal, sesame husk meal and shrimp head meal in both hybrid catfish and Nile tilapia.

The dairy farmer {{in the rural}} village, usually use rice brain and coconut meat kernels as the energy source, although coconut meat kernels is less palatable and too expensive. It is, therefore, important to seek for the other materials which are locally available and inexpensive. An experiment had carried out, using five lactating dairy cows in a Change Over Design as long as five periods. Each period lasted for 21 days, consisted of 14 days preliminary and seven days observation period. The animal function as column and the period as row, so that its 5 x 5 Latin Square. The treatment tested are five substitution levels of coconut meat kernels by <b>cassava</b> <b>meal</b> residues of 5, 7. 5, 10, 12. 5 and 15 percent dry matter ration respectively. The variables measured were : (1) ration digestibility and essential minerals balance; (2) daily milk production and milk composition; (3) rumen fermentation product. Based on the analysis of variance of all variables measured the experiment suggested that <b>cassava</b> <b>meal</b> residues {{can be used as}} the energy source to substitute coconut meat kernels in kernels in lactating dairy cattle ration of 5 up to 15 percent dry matter ration, without causing physiological disorder moreover, increases the milk composition...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to explore the potential to incorporate local plant-based feed ingredients into diets formulated for the mud crab species, Scylla paramamosain, commonly exploited for aquaculture in South-east Asia. Four test ingredients (defatted soybean meal, rice bran, <b>cassava</b> <b>meal</b> and corn flour) were incorporated at 30 % or 45 % inclusion levels in a fishmeal-based reference diet and used in digestibility trials where apparent digestibility coefficients (ADCs) for experimental diets and test ingredients were determined. Generally, high ADC values were obtained using diets containing 30 % soybean meal or rice bran. By contrast, the lowest ADC values were obtained for the diet containing 45 % <b>cassava</b> <b>meal</b> [70. 9 % for dry matter (ADMD); 77. 1 % for crude protein (ACPD) and 80. 2 % for gross energy (AGED) ]. Similar trends were observed when ADC ingredient (I) digestibilities were compared. Specifically, the highest ADCI values were obtained for soybean meal when used at a 30 % inclusion level (87. 6 % ADMDI; 98. 4 % ACPDI and 95. 6 % AGEDI) while the lowest ADCI values were obtained using <b>cassava</b> <b>meal</b> at a 45 % inclusion level (53. 8 % ADMDI; 60. 2 % ACPDI and 67. 3 % AGEDI).

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the digestibility of the nutrients of simplified and semi-simplified diets, with and without inclusion of exogenous enzymes and to determine the nutritional value of the fibrous sources. The tested feedstuffs were: alfalfa hay, hay from the upper third of the cassava foliage and <b>cassava</b> leaf <b>meal,</b> using a completely randomized design with 11 diets and 8 repetitions. The treatments were constituted of 1 reference diet, 2 simplified diets and 8 semi-simplified diets (4 enzymatic inclusion). The enzymes used were carbohydrases (alpha-galactosidase, galactomanose, xylanase and beta glucanase) and phytase. It was observed that the digestibility of the nutrients of the diets was influenced by the type of feed studied. Semi-simplified diets presented coefficients inferior to the reference diet and superior to the simplified diets. Exogenous enzymes promoted improvements in the digestibility of the dry matter (DM), organic matter, crude protein and gross energy. It was also observed that great part of the crude protein of the <b>cassava</b> leaf <b>meal</b> complexed, which depreciated the digestibility of diets with high inclusion of this ingredient.
