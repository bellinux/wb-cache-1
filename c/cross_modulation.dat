Although suppression of this tendency is integral to tasks of daily living, its exploitation may prove to be critical in the rehabilitation of acquired hemiplegias. In general, however, the task-related factors that determine the degree of coupling between the upper limbs and the mechanisms that mediate bilateral interactions between neural pathways projecting to the muscles of the arm and hand are not yet well understood. We present evidence that the postural context in which human participants perform upper limb movements determines the relative stability of patterns of bimanual coordination. Manipulation of the axes of rotation of forearm movements reversed the relative stability of simultaneous and alternating patterns of bimanual coordination.

All-optical wavelength conversion (inverted/noninverted and upconversion/downconversion) based on <b>cross</b> polarization <b>modulation</b> (XPolM) in SOAs are investi-gated.

5000|$|In radiophysics, the Luxemburg-Gorky effect (named after Radio Luxemburg and {{the city}} of Gorky (Nizhny Novgorod)) is a {{phenomenon}} of <b>cross</b> <b>modulation</b> between two radio waves, one of which is strong, passing through the same part of a medium, especially a conductive region of atmosphere or a plasma.Current theory seems to be that the conductivity of the ionosphere is affected by the presence of strong radio waves. The strength of a radio wave returning from the ionosphere to a distant point is dependent on this conductivity level. Therefore, if station “A” is radiating a strong amplitude modulated radio signal all around, some of it will modulate the conductivity of the ionosphere above the station. Then if station “B” is also sending an amplitude modulated signal from another location, the part of station “B’s” signal that passes through the ionosphere disturbed by station “A” to a receiver in line with both stations may have its strength modulated by the station “A” signal, even though the two are widely apart in frequency.In other words, the ionosphere passes the station “B” signal with a strength that varies in step with the modulation (voice, etc.) of station “A.” This re-modulation level of the station “B” signal is usually only a few percent, but is enough to make both stations audible. The interference (both stations simultaneously received) goes away as the receiver is tuned slightly away from the frequency of “B.” ...|$|E

Taken from mid-80's Korg DW-8000 synthesizer, these waveforms allow the creation of bell and electric piano-like sounds. Also, ring modulation and sync are available as modulation sources to generate sweep and vintage lead sounds.MIXERUsed for adjusting the levels of OSC1, OSC2 and NOISE. The combined signal is then sent to the FILTER.FILTERThe FILTER cuts or emphasizes frequency components of the signal from the oscillator, affecting tone and brightness. Three primary types of filtering are available: -12 or -24 dB/oct LPF (Low Pass Filter), -12 dB/oct BPF (Band Pass Filter), or -12 dB/oct HPF (High Pass Filter). Using EG1 to create time-variant changes in cutoff frequency adds a fourth type of filtering.AMPThe AMP stage consists of AMP (Amplifier), DIST (Distortion), and PAN (Panpot). AMP sets the volume, and PAN sets the sound's location in the stereo field. Using EG2 can create time-variant changes in volume. Quite harsh tones can be created by turning DIST on, and adjusting the filter cutoff and resonance, higher-pitched rings and tonalities are created with various harmonics layered on.EG1/2The Envelope Generator applies a time-variant change to each timbre parameter. On the MS2000/MS2000R, there are two standard ADSR EG’s for each timbre. EG1 is assigned as the envelope source that produces time variant changes in the FILTER cutoff frequency, while EG2 is assigned as the envelope source that produces time variant changes in the AMP volume. The MS2000's VIRTUAL PATCH module can be used to assign EG1 and EG2 to other parameters. LFO 1/2The LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator) applies cyclic change to sound parameters. The MS2000/MS2000R provides two LFO’s for each timbre, each with four waveforms. LFO1 is assigned as the modulation source for OSC1. LFO2 is assigned as the modulation source for the pitch modulation controlled by the modulation wheel. As with the EG's, VIRTUAL PATCH can be used to assign LFO1 and LFO2 to other parameters.VIRTUAL PATCHVIRTUAL PATCH allows the use of not only EG or LFO, but even keyboard velocity (keyboard playing dynamics) or keyboard tracking (the area of the keyboard that is played) as modulation sources which can be assigned to sound parameters for greater freedom in timbre editing and sound creating. Four routings (combinations) can be specified for each timbre.MOD SEQUENCEMOD SEQUENCE is a step sequencer that lets you apply time-variant change to various sound parameters in a way similar to analog synthesizers of the past. The sixteen knobs on the main panel can be used to set the value of each step and then the sequence is played back. The sound can be further modulated by the arpeggiator and by VIRTUAL PATCH. The knobs can also be operated in realtime, and their movements (parameter values) recorded in each step (Motion Rec function). Since each timbre can have up to three sequences, very complex tonal changes can be obtained.|$|E
