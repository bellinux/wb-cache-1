5000|$|By 1836-37 Laffitte had his affairs {{sufficiently}} {{in order}} to revive his 1825 plan for the Commanditaire. He created (15 July 1837) the Caisse Générale du Commerce et de l'Industrie to help provide long-term credit for industrial enterprise. The commandite rather than the joint-stock form of association was employed. The venture was capitalized at 55 million francs. The Bank of France imposed some annoying restrictions (the term [...] "Banque" [...] could not be employed), but otherwise the venture's approval went forward successfully. Laffitte's principal associates were his brother, Martin Laffitte (1783-1840), and the sugar industrialist François Lebaudy (1799-1863). Was this company the prototype for the great joint-stock investment banks {{of the second half}} of the 19th century in France? Historians continue to research and ponder this question. Laffitte himself appears to have understood that the Caisse Générale did not fulfill his dream of a real [...] "banque d'affaires." [...] He wrote in his Mémoires: [...] "If I was never able to create a great <b>credit</b> <b>establishment</b> like the one I would have wished, I at least built a great banking house that will be useful to Commerce and my family for a long time. That's a manly enough achievement for a 70-year old. Although others after me succeed in creating great credit establishments, for me there will remain the pride in having tried." ...|$|E

40|$|Agriculture plays {{vital role}} in Ethiopian economy. However, despite its {{importance}} and potential, the sector has remained at subsistence level. Animal protein is the most deficient nutrient in human diet. One of the traditional sources of animal protein {{of the developing world}} is through livestock rearing. Unfortunately, the livestock production is under increasing pressure from the combined effects of human population growth, shortage of grazing land and expanding desertification. Therefore, it is important to look for a better and cheap, alternative source of animal protein that is environmentally friendly. One of the alternative sources of animal protein could be fish farming and effective and sustainable utilization of existing potential fish resource. Ethiopia is endowed with over 7, 400 km 2 of lakes and reservoirs and 7, 000 km of rivers with total annual production potential estimated 51, 481 metric tone. Of this total potential, Lake Tana could contribute {{more than half of the}} estimate. With the aim of utilization of this potential and to increase its contribution to the national economy, fishery extension has been initiated and the modern fishing technology has been introduced in mid 1980 ’s. However, the country’s fishery resource is still underdeveloped and its contribution to the economy is negligible. This study has attempted to examine socio-economic and institutional factors influencing fishery resource utilization of Lake Tana. For the study, both primary and secondary data were used. Stratified random sampling method was employed to select 150 sample households. A total of 120 respondents gave adequate information out of 150 questionnaires administered in the community. The required primary data were collected through interviews using structured questionnaire. Of 120 sample respondents 59 and 41 percent’s were organized fishermen and non-organized fishermen, respectively. Results indicated education, training and credit access were significantly influenced fish resource utilization. The finding of the study revealed that, improving educational level, training on fishery resource management and utilization, access to <b>credit,</b> <b>establishment</b> of sustainable market, construction of roads and expansion of sea transportation system would promote fish resource utilization...|$|E
