40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} {{comparison}} between data acquired with frequency-modulated ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and satel-lite synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Both radars are polarimetric and operate at a center frequency of 5. 3 GHz. The field site is the polythermal glacier Kongsvegen, Svalbard. Along glacier GPR profiles cover the ablation area and the accumulation area, where the latter consists of superimposed ice (SI) and firn. The glacier facies are clearly identifiable on the GPR profiles, although we show that the copolarized response is better for distinguishing different ice zones, whereas the SI–firn boundary is most obvious in the <b>cross-polarized</b> <b>response.</b> A calibrated backscatter coeffi-cient is calculated for the GPR data and compared with the SAR backscatter coefficient. The SAR zones are in very good agreement with the GPR-derived glacier facies. We show that, in the ablation area, the SAR response is dominated by backscatter from the previous summer surface. In the SI and firn areas, it is dominated by sources below the previous summer surface. Index Terms—Backscatter, glacier facies, ground-penetrating radar (GPR), synthetic aperture radar (SAR).

40|$|We have {{developed}} antenna-coupled transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers {{for a wide}} range of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarimetry experiments, including BICEP 2, Keck Array, and the balloon borne SPIDER. These detectors have reached maturity and this paper reports on their design principles, overall performance, and key challenges associated with design and production. Our detector arrays repeatedly produce spectral bands with 20 %- 30 % bandwidth at 95, 150, or 220 ~GHz. The integrated antenna arrays synthesize symmetric co-aligned beams with controlled side-lobe levels. <b>Cross-polarized</b> <b>response</b> on boresight is typically ~ 0. 5 %, consistent with cross-talk in our multiplexed readout system. End-to-end optical efficiencies in our cameras are routinely 35 % or higher, with per detector sensitivities of NET~ 300 uKrts. Thanks to the scalability of this design, we have deployed 2560 detectors as 1280 matched pairs in Keck Array with a combined instantaneous sensitivity of ~ 9 uKrts, as measured directly from CMB maps in the 2013 season. Similar arrays have recently flown in the SPIDER instrument, and development of this technology is ongoing. Comment: 16 pgs, 20 fig...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} {{symmetry}} of polarimetric scattering and emission coefficients of media with reflection symmetry. A reflection operator is defined {{and is used}} to create the images of electromagnetic fields and sources. The image fields satisfy Maxwell's equations, meaning that Maxwell's equations are invariant under the described reflection operations. By applying the reflection operations to media with reflection symmetry, the symmetry properties of the Stokes parameters, characterizing the polarization state of thermal emissions, are shown to agree with existing experimental data. The first two Stokes parameters are symmetric {{with respect to the}} reflection plane, while the third and fourth Stokes parameters have odd symmetry. In active remote sensing, the symmetry properties of the polarimetric scattering matrix elements of deterministic targets and the polarimetric covariance matrix elements of random media or distributed targets are examined. For deterministic targets, the <b>cross-polarized</b> <b>responses</b> are odd functions with respect to the symmetry direction, whereas the copolarized responses are even functions. For distributed targets or random media, it is found that the correlations of copolarized and <b>cross-polarized</b> <b>responses</b> are antisymmetric with respect to the reflection plane, while the other covariance matrix elements are symmetric. Consequently, in the cases of backscatter, the copolarized and cross-polarized components are completely uncorrelated when the incidence direction is on the symmetry plane. The derived symmetry properties of polarimetric backscattering coefficients agree with the predictions of a two-scale surface scattering model and existing sea surface HH and VV backscatter data. Finally, the conditions for a general type of media, i. e., bianisotropic media, to be reflection symmetric are examined. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{developed}} an optical probe for cross-polarized reflected light measurements and investigated optical signals associated with electrophysiological activation in isolated lobster nerves. The cross-polarized baseline light intensity (structural signal) and the amplitude of the transient response to stimulation (functional signal) measured in reflected mode were {{dependent on the}} orientation of the nerve axis relative to the polarization plane of incident light. The maximum structural signal and functional response amplitude were observed at 45 °, and the ratio of functional to structural signals was approximately constant across orientations. Functional responses were measured in single trials in both transmitted and reflected geometries and responses had similar waveforms. Both structural and functional signals were an order of magnitude smaller in reflected than in transmitted light measurements, but functional responses had similar signal/noise ratios. We propose a theoretical model based on geometrical optics that is consistent with experimental results. In the model, the cross-polarized structural signal results from light reflection from axonal fibers and the transient functional response arises from axonal swelling associated with neural activation. Polarization-sensitive reflected light measurements could greatly enhance in vivo imaging of neural activation since <b>cross-polarized</b> <b>responses</b> are much larger than scattering signals now employed for dynamic functional neuroimaging...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Tuning {{performance}} of a chiral layer using varactor diodes is presented here. The chiral structure consists of an array of metallic long helices fabricated in parallel on a PCB. The he-lices have the same handedness, sub-wavelength diameter, pitch, and spacing in the array. Varactor diodes are incorporated into the array to tune array <b>cross-polarized</b> transmission <b>response,</b> a qualitative measure of the effective tuned chirality. Each helix is connected to one of its neighboring helices {{through a set of}} varac-tors placed between them. Array has one varactor per one helix pitch. The tuning {{performance of}} the chiral array transmissivity is measured over frequency band of 5. 5 – 12 GHz with the bias voltage sweeping from 1 to 15 V. Voltage tuning changes each varactor ca-pacitance from 0. 9 to 0. 13 pF. This results in % increase in the cross-polarization peak frequency, changing it from 6 to 9 GHz, for a linear polarization incidence perpendicular to the helices. Tuning rotates the transmitted wave polarization ellipse by. Index Terms—Bianisotropic, chiral, polarization rotation, tun-able. I...|$|R
