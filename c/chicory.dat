5|$|In {{the movie}} Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis, Philippe Abrams (Kad Merad) and Antoine Bailleul (Dany Boon) share {{together}} countless breakfasts consisting of tartines de Maroilles (a rather strong cheese) {{along with their}} hot <b>chicory.</b>|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{preparations}} of acquacotta may use stale, fresh, or toasted bread, and {{can include}} additional ingredients such as vegetable broth, eggs, cheeses such as Parmigiano-Reggiano and Pecorino Toscano, celery, garlic, basil, beans such as cannellini beans, cabbage, kale, lemon juice, salt, pepper, potatoes and others. Some versions may use edible mushrooms such as porcini, wild herbs, and leaf vegetables/greens such as arugula, endive, mint, chard, <b>chicory,</b> dandelion greens, watercress, valerian and others. As the greens boil down, {{they contribute to}} the broth's flavor. The dish may be topped with a poached egg. Contemporary versions may be prepared in advance from {{a few hours to}} a day, stored in a cold place or refrigerated, and then reheated prior to serving. It can also be preserved by freezing.|$|E
5|$|The {{coastline}} supplies many crustaceans, sea bass, monkfish and herring. Normandy has {{top quality}} seafood, such as scallops and sole, while Brittany has {{a supply of}} lobster, crayfish and mussels. Normandy {{is home to a}} large population of apple trees; apples are often used in dishes, as well as cider and Calvados. The northern areas of this region, especially Nord, grow ample amounts of wheat, sugar beets and <b>chicory.</b> Thick stews are found often in these northern areas as well. The produce of these northern regions is also considered some {{of the best in the}} country, including cauliflower and artichokes. Buckwheat grows widely in Brittany as well and is used in the region's galettes, called jalet, which is where this dish originated.|$|E
5|$|In 1792 {{over the}} 25 {{days of the}} first {{landfall}} in Recherche Bay, Tasmania, Delahaye established a European vegetable garden. Its purpose was {{as a source of}} food and propagation material for the indigenous people, and also as a supply of provisions for future visiting European vessels. This was the first European garden on mainland Tasmania, planted just north of where the ships were anchored and, until recently, was last sighted by Lady Jane Franklin in the 1840s. Offshore, on Bruny Island, a small orchard had been planted a few months previously by Englishman William Bligh's expedition, presumably planted by Bligh's gardener David Nelson. Delahaye's journal reports that he planted celery, chervil, <b>chicory,</b> cabbages, grey romaine lettuce, different kinds of turnip, white onion, radishes, sorrel, peas, black salsify and potatoes; he also had large quantities sewn in the woods, thrown at random where they might grow. Returning on 21 January 1793 the garden had not been productive, the seed having been planted in dry and sandy soil. This time Delahaye tried explaining to the Aboriginal people, referred to today as the Lyluequonny, that the tubers, when cooked in fire embers, made fine eating. Calling in on the Adventure Bay side of Bruny Island Delahaye examined and tended the two pomegranate, one quince and three fig trees planted by Bligh’s expedition in 1792.|$|E

25|$|The Mishnah listed several {{vegetables}} that could fulfill {{the requirement to}} have a bitter herb (maror). They have been translated as lettuce, <b>chicory,</b> pepperwort, endives, and dandelion.|$|E
25|$|Northern Michigan {{has many}} tree types {{including}} maple, birch, oak, ash, white cedar, aspen, pine, and beech. Ferns, milkweed, Queen Anne's lace, and <b>chicory</b> {{grow in the}} open fields and along roadsides. Forest plants include wild leeks, morel mushrooms, and trilliums. Marram grass grows on beaches. Several mosses cover the land.|$|E
25|$|Many egg, fish, {{and other}} dishes employ fresh or dried fennel leaves. Florence fennel {{is a key}} {{ingredient}} in some Italian and German salads, often tossed with <b>chicory</b> and avocado, {{or it can be}} braised and served as a warm side dish. It may be blanched or marinated, or cooked in risotto.|$|E
25|$|The {{rationing}} {{system also}} applied to clothing: leather was reserved exclusively for German army boots, and vanished completely from the market. Leather shoes {{were replaced by}} shoes made of rubber or canvas (raffia) with wooden soles. A variety of ersatz or substitute products appeared, which were not {{exactly what they were}} called: ersatz wine, coffee (made with <b>chicory),</b> tobacco and soap.|$|E
25|$|Modification of Phillip Island and its Summerland Peninsula {{began after}} European Settlement in the 1830s and 1840s. In 1839 the entire island (approximately 10,000 hectares) was cleared by burning {{to make way}} for agriculture, by 1872 farmers had settled the {{peninsula}} cultivating <b>chicory</b> and bringing cattle and rabbits which further decimated the land. Residential developments and recreational activities soon followed in the 1900s.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s, Indian filter coffee, a sweet milky coffee {{made from}} dark roasted coffee beans (70%–80%) and <b>chicory</b> (20%–30%) became a {{commercial}} success. It was especially {{popular in the}} southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The most commonly used coffee beans are Arabica and Robusta grown {{in the hills of}} Karnataka (Kodagu, Chikkamagaluru and Hassan), Kerala (Malabar region) and Tamil Nadu (Nilgiris District, Yercaud and Kodaikanal).|$|E
25|$|The French Counts of St Hubert, Saskatchewan {{established}} Rolanderie Ranch and {{a gentleman}} lifestyle at Whitewood, Saskatchewan in 1884. The Counts sought {{to establish a}} number of commercial ventures, including a <b>chicory</b> processing factory, a Gruyere cheese factory, a sugar beet venture and a horse breeding operation. They occasionally socialized with the English colonial outpost of Cannington Manor. In the 1880s Edward Pierce tried to transplant early Victorian living at Cannington Manor in the 1880s, now preserved as Cannington Manor Provincial Park.|$|E
25|$|Women had {{charge of}} making do. They {{cut back on}} purchases, brought out old {{spinning}} wheels and enlarged their gardens with flax and peas to provide clothing and food. They used ersatz substitutes when possible, {{but there was no}} real coffee {{and it was hard to}} develop a taste for the okra or <b>chicory</b> substitutes used. The households were severely hurt by inflation in the cost of everyday items like flour and the shortages of food, fodder for the animals, and medical supplies for the wounded.|$|E
25|$|Chemically {{defined as}} {{oligosaccharides}} occurring naturally in most plants, inulins have nutritional value as carbohydrates, or more specifically as fructans, a polymer {{of the natural}} plant sugar, fructose. Inulin is typically extracted by manufacturers from enriched plant sources such as <b>chicory</b> roots or Jerusalem artichokes for use in prepared foods. Subtly sweet, {{it can be used}} to replace sugar, fat, and flour, is often used to improve the flow and mixing qualities of powdered nutritional supplements, and has significant potential health value as a prebiotic fermentable fiber.|$|E
25|$|Coffee {{had been}} {{introduced}} to Paris in about 1660, and came from Martinique and the IÎe de Bourbon, now Réunion. The English blockade of French ports cut off the supply, and Parisians were forced to drink substitutes made from the <b>chicory</b> or acorns. The blockade also cut off the supplies of chocolate, tea and sugar. Napoleon encouraged the growing of sugar beets to replace cane sugar, and in February 1812 he went himself to taste {{the products of the}} first sugar beet refineries opened just outside the city, at Passy and Chaillot.|$|E
25|$|Bitterness is {{the most}} {{sensitive}} of the tastes, and many perceive it as unpleasant, sharp, or disagreeable, but it is sometimes desirable and intentionally added via various bittering agents. Common bitter foods and beverages include coffee, unsweetened cocoa, South American mate, bitter gourd, olives, citrus peel, many plants in the Brassicaceae family, dandelion greens, wild <b>chicory,</b> and escarole. The ethanol in alcoholic beverages tastes bitter, as do the additional bitter ingredients found in some alcoholic beverages including hops in beer and orange in bitters. Quinine is also known for its bitter taste and is found in tonic water.|$|E
25|$|Food {{was also}} flavored by plants, most {{native to the}} region and either {{cultivated}} or gathered in the wild, although a few spices were imported. Garlic and onions, and possibly fenugreek, were used to season cooked foods, {{as well as being}} eaten as vegetables. Herbs and spices included capers, coriander, cumin and black cumin, dill, dwarf <b>chicory,</b> hyssop, marjoram, mint, black mustard, reichardia, saffron and thyme. Some seasonings were imported, such as myrrh, galbanum, saffron and cinnamon, but their high cost limited their widespread use. Spices for special feasts were imported by the wealthy and royalty from Arabia and India, and were highly valued. These included various types of pepper, and ginger.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} USDA-approved field {{releases}} for testing grew from 4 in 1985 to 1,194 in 2002 and averaged around 800 per year thereafter. The number of sites per release {{and the number}} of gene constructs (ways that the gene of interest is packaged together with other elements)—have rapidly increased since 2005. Releases with agronomic properties (such as drought resistance) jumped from 1,043 in 2005 to 5,190 in 2013. As of September 2013, about 7,800 releases had been approved for corn, more than 2,200 for soybeans, more than 1,100 for cotton, and about 900 for potatoes. Releases were approved for herbicide tolerance (6,772 releases), insect resistance (4,809), product quality such as flavor or nutrition (4,896), agronomic properties like drought resistance (5,190), and virus/fungal resistance (2,616). The institutions with the most authorized field releases include Monsanto with 6,782, Pioneer/DuPont with 1,405, Syngenta with 565, and USDA’s Agricultural Research Service with 370. As of September 2013 USDA had received proposals for releasing GM rice, squash, plum, rose, tobacco, flax, and <b>chicory.</b>|$|E

500|$|Le petit déjeuner (breakfast) is {{traditionally}} a quick meal consisting of tartines (slices) of French bread {{with butter and}} honey or jam (sometimes brioche), along with café au lait (also called [...] "café crème"), or black coffee, or tea and rarely hot <b>chicory.</b> Children often drink hot chocolate in bowls or cups along with their breakfasts. Croissants, pain aux raisins or pain au chocolat (also named chocolatine {{in the south of}} France) are mostly included as a weekend treat. Breakfast of some kind is always served in cafés opening early in the day.|$|E
500|$|Attempts by the 4th and 11th Canadian Infantry Brigades to {{eliminate}} an enemy salient between Cité St. Élisabeth and Lens on 17 August failed and {{as had been}} foreseen the Germans continued to mount determined counter-attacks. The German command {{began to realize that}} the Canadian and British artillery would need to be neutralized before a counter-attack could succeed. The Germans began a series of counter-attacks against a chalk quarry under Canadian control outside of Cité St. Auguste but also sought to wear down the Canadian artillery resources by sending up false flare signals or provoking the infantry to call for unnecessary artillery fire. The Germans also began to use poison gas in earnest. From [...] the new Yellow Cross shells containing the blistering agent sulfur mustard were fired in addition to an undetermined number of shells containing diphosgene. The Canadian 1st and 2nd Artillery Field Brigades and the Canadian front line were heavily gassed. Many artillery men became casualties after gas fogged the goggles of their respirators and they were forced to remove their masks to set the fuses, lay their sights and maintain accurate fire. The Germans used the cover of gas to make a number of attempts against the Canadian controlled chalk quarry and <b>Chicory</b> Trench on the night of [...] 17 August and early morning of 18 August. All attempts against the chalk quarry failed and only one company of the 55th Reserve Infantry Regiment (on loan to the 11th Reserve Division) managed to breach the Canadian defences at <b>Chicory</b> Trench before being repulsed. German troops employing flamethrowers managed to penetrate the Canadian line north of the quarry on the morning of 18 August before being driven out.|$|E
500|$|Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) is {{an annual}} plant of the daisy family, Asteraceae. It {{is most often}} grown as a leaf vegetable, but {{sometimes}} for its stem and seeds. [...] Lettuce is most often used for salads, although it is also seen in other kinds of food, such as soups, sandwiches and wraps; {{it can also be}} grilled. [...] One variety, the [...] (...) , or asparagus lettuce (celtuce), is grown for its stems, which are eaten either raw or cooked. In addition to its main use as a leafy green, it has also gathered religious and medicinal significance over centuries of human consumption. [...] Europe and North America originally dominated the market for lettuce, but by the late 20th century the consumption of lettuce had spread throughout the world. [...] World production of lettuce and <b>chicory</b> for calendar year 2013 was 24.9 million tonnes, over half of which came from China.|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for German counter-attacks, the 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions began to reinforce and construct strong points immediately after capturing the first objective line. Within {{two hours of}} {{the start of the}} battle, the Germans began using their immediate reserves to mount local counter-attacks. Between [...] on the morning of 15 August, the Germans executed four local attacks against Canadian positions. Each attack was repulsed {{due in large part to}} the work of forward artillery observers, who could now overlook some of the German positions. On one occasion, the counter-attack was only repulsed after engaging in hand-to-hand fighting. The Germans rapidly brought up seven additional battalions from the 4th Guards Division and 185th Division to reinforce the eight line battalions already in place. Over the following three days, the Germans executed no less than 21 counter-attacks against Canadian positions. A frontal attack against the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade on the afternoon of 15 August ultimately failed. A German attack against the 4th Canadian Infantry Brigade was initially successful with the Germans re-capturing <b>Chicory</b> Trench but were repulsed later the same afternoon.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{investigation}} {{showed that}} [...] "it {{is a fact}} that coffee is largely adulterated". Of 34 coffees, 31 were adulterated; the three exceptions were of higher price. [...] The main adulteration was <b>chicory,</b> otherwise bean-flour, potato-flour or roasted corn was used. Moreover, it was found that <b>chicory</b> itself was usually adulterated. The Lancet published the names of the genuine traders and threatened the others with exposure if they failed to mend their ways. A second report (26 April 1851) actually carried out the threat. A third report showed that canister coffee was even more adulterated. Investigations of sugar, pepper, bread, tobacco and tea followed, finallis then the purity of the water supply. The first Adulteration Act became law in 1860, the second in 1872. The Sale of Food and Drugs Acts of 1875 and 1879 followed. All was achieved by Wakley and his associates.|$|E

2500|$|Wild lettuce, {{known as}} chazeret, was a leafy herb with prickly, red tinged leaves that became bitter as they matured. It was {{cultivated}} from around 800 BCE. Sweeter head-lettuce was only developed and {{introduced by the}} Romans. Bitter herbs eaten at the Passover sacrifice with the unleavened bread, matza, were known as merorim. [...] "Chazeret" [...] is listed in the Mishna (Pesahim 2:6) as the preferred bitter herb for this Passover ritual, along with other bitter herbs, including <b>chicory</b> or endive (ulshin), horehound (tamcha), reichardia or eryngo (charchavina) and wormwood (maror).|$|E
