5|$|Hammond organs have a {{built-in}} vibrato effect {{that provides a}} small variation in pitch while a note is being played, and a <b>chorus</b> <b>effect</b> where a note's sound is combined with another sound at a slightly different and varying pitch. The best known vibrato and chorus system consists of six settings, V1, V2, V3, C1, C2 and C3 (i.e., three each of vibrato and chorus), which can be selected via a rotary switch. Vibrato / chorus can be selected for each manual independently.|$|E
25|$|Woofer {{enclosures}} must {{be larger}} and more sturdily built than cabinets for mid-range or high-frequency (tweeter) speakers. As such, in the 1950s, when Ampeg introduced bass amplifier and speaker systems, bass guitarists began to use them. Similarly, Hammond organ players used a specialized keyboard combo amplifier, the Leslie speaker cabinet, which contains a woofer for the low frequencies and a horn for the high frequencies. The Leslie horns rotate and a baffle around the woofer rotates as well, producing a rich tremolo and <b>chorus</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E

500|$|Author Mark Brend writes that, with Revolver, the Beatles {{advanced}} Meek's {{strategy of}} employing {{the recording studio}} as a musical instrument and [...] "formalized this approach into what is now an accepted option for pop music making". A key production technique they used was automatic double tracking (ADT), which EMI technical engineer Ken Townsend invented on 6 April. This technique employed two linked tape recorders to automatically create a doubled vocal track. The standard method had been to double the vocal by singing the same piece twice onto a multitrack tape, a task Lennon particularly disliked. The Beatles were delighted with the invention, and used it extensively on Revolver. ADT soon became a standard pop production technique, and led to related developments such as the artificial <b>chorus</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
500|$|Other key pedals used by grunge bands {{included}} four {{brands of}} distortion pedals (the Big Muff, DOD and BOSS DS-2 and BOSS DS-1 distortion pedals) and the Small Clone <b>chorus</b> <b>effect,</b> used by Kurt Cobain on [...] "Come As You Are" [...] {{and by the}} Screaming Trees on [...] "Nearly Lost You". The RAT distortion pedal {{played a key role}} in Cobain’s switching from quiet to loud and back to quiet approach to songwriting. The use of small pedals by grunge guitarists helped to start off the revival of interest in boutique, hand-soldered, 1970s-style analog pedals. The other effect that grunge guitarists used was one of the most low-tech effects devices, the wah-wah pedal; it is one of the rare pedals that requires no external battery or AC mains power and it uses very simple circuitry. Both [...] " [...] Thayil and Alice in Chains’ Jerry Cantrell...were great advocates of the wah wah pedal." [...] Wah was also used by the Screaming Trees, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Dinosaur Jr.|$|E
500|$|The {{interlude}} [...] "My Way Home" [...] {{contains a}} sample of [...] "Home is Where the Hatred Is" [...] by Gil Scott-Heron. This facet is accentuated by Common's performance, which pays homage to the poet by the delivering its single verse in a distinctive proto-rap manner reminiscent of Scott-Heron's influential vocal style. [...] "Crack Music" [...] is sparsely built on incessant snare drum hits and clipped horn blares. The track sees an ephemeral return of West's old production attributes, as it possesses a syncopated martial beat, gospel choir symphony, and a spoken word passage within its coda. The poetic [...] "Roses" [...] is partially a cappella in structure, displaying verses rapped over sparse keyboards and a slowed rhythm with the music arriving at the chorus, which features additional vocals, trumpet riffs, electric guitar phrasings, and finally a vocal and piano sample from Bill Withers' [...] "Rosie". [...] "Bring Me Down" [...] carries a bombast dramatic air, as it holds more orchestration than any other track on Late Registration. Additionally, it features an overdubbing of Brandy's vocals to create a <b>chorus</b> <b>effect,</b> a recording technique in which her lone voice produces {{the illusion of a}} choir singing harmonies during the choruses. The up-tempo arrangement of [...] "Addiction" [...] contains ambient, rhythmic guitar licks, congas, filtered hi-hats and a sampled line from [...] "My Funny Valentine" [...] as performed by Etta James. All the while, West's overdubbed vocals reverbs {{in and out of the}} track. For [...] "Diamonds from Sierra Leone", West used a music sample of the theme song for the 1971 James Bond film, Diamonds Are Forever as performed by Shirley Bassey and layered it with live drums, piano keys, harpsichord arpeggios, and string arrangements that all build in intensity with his voice.|$|E

2500|$|The dulcimer {{comes in}} various sizes, {{identified}} {{by the number of}} strings that cross each of the bridges. A 15/14, for example, has 15 strings crossing the treble bridge and 14 crossing the bass bridge, and can span three octaves. The strings of a hammered dulcimer are usually found in pairs, two strings for each note (though some instruments have three or four strings per note). Each set of strings is tuned in unison and is called a course. As with a piano, the purpose of using multiple strings per course is to make the instrument louder, although as the courses are rarely in perfect unison, a <b>chorus</b> <b>effect</b> usually results like a mandolin. A hammered dulcimer, like an autoharp, harp, or piano, requires a tuning wrench for tuning, since the dulcimer's strings are wound around tuning pins with square heads. (Ordinarily, 5mm [...] "zither pins" [...] are used, similar to, but smaller in diameter than piano tuning pins, which come in various sizes ranging upwards from [...] "1/0" [...] or 7mm.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Vaughan was a {{catalyst}} in {{the revival of}} vintage amplifiers and effects during the 1980s. His loud volume and use of heavy strings required powerful and robust amplifiers. Vaughan used two black-face Fender Super Reverbs, which were crucial in shaping his clear overdriven sound. He would often blend other amps with the Super Reverbs, including black-face Fender Vibroverbs, and brands such as Dumble, and Marshall, which he used for his clean sound. While his mainstay effects were the Ibanez Tube Screamer and a Vox wah-wah pedal, Vaughan experimented {{with a range of}} effects. He used a Fender Vibratone, designed as a Leslie speaker for electric guitars, and provided a warbling <b>chorus</b> <b>effect,</b> which can be heard on the track [...] "Cold Shot". He used a vintage Dallas Arbiter Fuzz Face that can be heard on In Step, as well as an Octavia. The Guitar Geek website provides a detailed illustration of Vaughan's 1985 equipment set up based on interviews with his guitar tech and effects builder, Cesar Diaz.|$|E

40|$|Vibrato, Flange, and Stereo Chorus {{are perhaps}} the three most often used digital audio effects that are created by {{smoothly}} modulating the duration of a delay line at typically sub-audio rates.

In order to establish norms for the musically useful range of modulation rate and depth for such delay-based effects, 25 listeners were asked to make categorical judgments regarding their perception of vibrato, flange, and stereo <b>chorus</b> <b>effects.</b> The results map out for these two modulation parameters three perceptual regions for these three related effects: the region in which modulation is too subtle for effective use, the parameter ranges that seem most musically useful, and the region in which it is too extreme for most musical applications.

Used on instruments like [...] "clean" [...] (undistorted) electric guitar and keyboards, it can yield very dreamy or ambient sounds. Commercial <b>chorus</b> <b>effect</b> devices often include controls that enable them to be used to also produce delay, reverberation, or other related effects that use similar hardware, rather than exclusively as chorus effects.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, Belly {{released}} a second album, King, which progressed the avant folk-rock influences, power-pop jangle guitar sounds, and vocal harmonies {{of the first}} album into a direction driven more by vocals and driving rhythms, varying the pace within the songs to create tension.
