40|$|Heavy {{metal and}} cyanide {{contamination}} in electroplating wastewater can pose a serious environmental problem if not removed prior to discharge (Rajeswari and Sailaja 2014). Electrocoagulation {{has been shown}} to effectively remove many of these contaminants separately using batch treatment systems (Adhoum et al. 2004). The present study seeks to test the technologic efficacy of mixed electrocoagulation and hydroxide precipitation to simultaneously treat metals common to the electroplating industry (Ni+ 2, Cu + 2, Sn+ 2), and cyanide (CN−). The ultimate goal of the study is to offer a process which has the potential for use in continuous treatment. ^ Cyanide ion (CN-) begins to form volatile and dangerous hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in increasing concentrations as the pH drops below 11. At the same time, literature shows a drop-off in metal removal efficiencies using electrocoagulation at pH’s above 10 (Kobya et al. 2010). To overcome this drop, process variables such as current density, agitation rate, and volumetric flow rate of air were optimized using removal speed and final concentration as the chosen metrics. The data followed first and pseudo-first order kinetics which allowed the rate constants to gauge the relative rates of removal. ^ The present work was able to reduce Ni+ 2, Cu+ 2, Sn+ 2 and CN− concentrations below the discharge limits set forth by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The electrocoagulation cell conditions were optimized at a current density of 50 ASF, spin speed of 0 RPM, and volumetric flowrate of air of 0. 0022 ft 3 /min. This, along with a treatment time of 112 minutes, yielded an electricity consumption of 0. 0206 kwh/L and an iron consumption of 3. 83 g/L. ^ The study showed aeration to be necessary in achieving EPA discharge limits for <b>complex</b> <b>cyanide</b> removal. The use of aeration decreased the final concentration of <b>complex</b> <b>cyanide</b> from 4. 1 to 0. 91 mg/L after 2 hours of treatment. Testing also revealed direct reduction of metallic contaminants to the cathode to be another method of removal. Overall, the study shows electrocoagulation to be technologically and economically viable when treating high speed electroplating effluent. Due to the chosen conditions, the process also has the possibility of being extended to continuous treatment in the future. ...|$|E

It was possible to detect free cyanide below the concentration 3 ppm in the factory drain. Measurement time is within five minutes. We found that total cyanide can be detected with a simple pretreatment. The evaluation of the water quality using the taste sensor is an effective method, and is suited for constant monitoring of the factory drain quality.

We focus our discussion on the eight complex organics detected within the HIFI survey utilizing a novel technique to identify those molecules emitting in the hottest gas. In particular, we find the complex nitrogen bearing species CH_ 3 CN, C_ 2 H_ 3 CN, C_ 2 H_ 5 CN, and NH_ 2 CHO systematically trace hotter gas than the oxygen bearing organics CH_ 3 OH, C_ 2 H_ 5 OH, CH_ 3 OCH_ 3, and CH_ 3 OCHO, which do not contain nitrogen. If these complex species form predominantly on grain surfaces, this may indicate N-bearing organics {{are more difficult to}} remove from grain surfaces than O-bearing species. Another possibility is that hot (T_ kin∼ 300 K) gas phase chemistry naturally produces higher <b>complex</b> <b>cyanide</b> abundances while suppressing the formation of O-bearing complex organics. We compare our derived rotation temperatures and molecular abundances to chemical models, which include gas-phase and grain surface pathways. Abundances for a majority of the detected complex organics can be reproduced over timescales ≳ 10 ^ 5 years, with several species being under predicted by less than 3 σ. Derived rotation temperatures for most organics, furthermore, agree reasonably well with the predicted temperatures at peak abundance. We also find that sulfur bearing molecules which also contain oxygen (i. e.

Upon exposure of the reduced catalysts to synthesis gas at 548 K, the metallic iron rapidly reacts to a mixture of e'-Fe 2. 2 C and ¿-Fe 5 C 2 carbides. Prolonged reaction causes the contribution of ¿-Fe 5 C 2 to increase {{at the expense of the}} e'-Fe 2. 2 C. Infrared spectroscopy performed with a Cu 2 Fe catalyst after intermittent Fischer–Tropsch reactions at increasingly higher temperatures indicates at 300 K the presence of both Fe- and Cu-like sites at the surface of the bimetallic particles. The number of Cu-like sites, however, decreases at 373 K and becomes negligible at 423 K.

A single crystal study of this radical has been performed and the structure determined and compared with the HCN- and H 2 CN radicals which were also formed on irradiation of the doped potassium chloride. In all three radicals the unpaired electron is in the plane of the molecule and there is a considerable delocalization of the spin density. The effect of both ?-irradiation and ultra-violet irradiation on ferrous and ruthenium hexacyanide incorporated into alkali halide lattices has been examined by electron spin resonance, infra-red and electronic spectroscopy. The new spectral bands have been interpreted in terms of the formation of iron and ruthenium complexes in oxidation state (I). The electron spin resonance spectra indicate a novel distortion of the d 7 transition metal complex which produces a unique ligand. Possible interpretations of the electron spin resonance spectra are discussed.

40|$|During {{the gold}} cyanidation process, cyanide can be lost from the {{leachate}} by various chemical routes. Since cyanide is generally {{the most expensive}} reagent in this process, {{it is becoming increasingly}} important to monitor these cyanide losses. The products of these cyanide losses include base metal <b>cyanide</b> <b>complexes,</b> thiocyanate and cyanate. The two most significant cyanicides in order of importance are sulfides and copper bearing minerals. The problems caused by cyanide soluble copper minerals are well known to the gold processing industry and have been reviewed by several authors (e. g. 1, 2). One particular facet of this problem concerns the effect of the CN:Cu mole ratio, R, on the gold leaching kinetics. In order to efficiently leach cupriferous ores, it is important that R is maintained at a level that allows sufficiently rapid leaching without excessive use of cyanide. An additional consideration when leaching cupriferous ores is the oxidation of cyanide by Cu(11) minerals, resulting in the formation of cyanate. Ion chromatography (IC) has been successfully used for the determination of <b>cyanide,</b> metal <b>cyanide</b> <b>complexes,</b> thiocyanate and cyanate in leachates. Most of the important metal-cyanide complexes and thiocyanate can be determined by reverse phase ion interaction chromatography (e. g. 3, 4, 5, 6). Cyanide and cyanate are both unretained in the separation of the metal <b>cyanide</b> <b>complexes</b> and are not detectable as their respective anions. However, it has been possible to determine cyanide in this separation by either precolumn derivatisation with Ag to form [Ag(CN) J (4) or post-column derivatisation with a selective colourimetric reaction to produce a visible dye (5). There are no reactions suitable for the analogous pre or post column derivatisation of cyanate in the above separation of metal <b>cyanide</b> <b>complexes.</b> Cyanate has been determined separately on an anion exchange column (e. g. 7, 8, 9).

Decomposition commences at 130 °C and is complete at 300 °C. Reactions with mineral acids (HX) produce the corresponding cadmium salts (CdX2). With hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and nitric acid, the products are cadmium chloride, cadmium sulfate and cadmium nitrate, respectively.|$|R
50|$|The {{reaction}} proceeds via the {{oxidative addition}} of HCN to Ni(0) {{to give a}} hydridonickel(II) <b>cyanide</b> <b>complex,</b> abbreviated Ni(H)(CN)L2. Subsequent binding of the alkene gives the intermediate Ni(H)(CN)L(alkene), which then undergoes migratory insertion to give an alkylnickel(II) cyanide Ni(R)(CN)L2. The cycle is completed by the reductive elimination of the nitrile.|$|R
50|$|The work of Alfred Werner and {{his contemporaries}} {{laid the groundwork}} for the study of {{coordination}} polymers. Terms ubiquitous in the field, such as coordination number, were coined by Werner. Many time honored materials are now recognized as coordination polymers. These include the <b>cyanide</b> <b>complexes</b> Prussian blue and Hofmann clathrates.|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{sensitive}} method is described for {{the determination of}} traces of nickel in sodium metal. The nickel is <b>complexed</b> with potassium <b>cyanide</b> and the absorption measured spectrophotometrically at 268 mµ. Interference of iron and chromium is removed by precipitation of the hydroxides from homogeneous solution. This method should be applicable {{to a wide range}} of materials...|$|R
