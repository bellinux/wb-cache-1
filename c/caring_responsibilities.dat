2500|$|There are {{two kinds}} of {{employment}}: Formal and Informal. Formal employment is government regulated and workers are insured a wage and certain rights. Informal employment takes place in small, unregistered enterprises. It is generally a large source of employment for women. The burden of informal care work falls predominantly on women, who work longer and harder in this role than men. This affects their ability to hold other jobs and change positions, the hours they can work, and their decision to give up work. However, women who have University degrees or other forms of higher learning tend to stay in their jobs even with <b>caring</b> <b>responsibilities,</b> which suggests that the human capital from this experience causes women to feel opportunity costs when they lose their employment. Having children has also historically affected women's choice to stay employed. While this [...] "child-effect" [...] has significantly decreased since the 1970s, women's employment is currently decreasing. This {{has less to do with}} child-rearing and more with a poor job market for all women, mothers and non-mothers alike.|$|E

40|$|Background: Due to a {{high number}} of female and {{employed}} family caregivers it is hypothesized that also the proportion of nurses with private <b>care</b> <b>responsibilities</b> is high. Both, professional nursing and responsibilities as private caregiver are associated with high physical and psychological burden. Objective: The objective was to investigate the extent of double burden of nurses with <b>care</b> <b>responsibilities</b> at home and possible associations with work- and health-related outcomes. Method: The study is based on a secondary data analysis of the baseline data of the German sample of the Nurses’ Early Exit Study (NEXT-Study). Applying a case-control design, nurses with <b>care</b> <b>responsibilities</b> at home were matched to controls by a genetic propensity score algorithm. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to investigate the characteristics of the double duty and associations with work and health strain. Results: 213 of 2, 749 nurses had private <b>care</b> <b>responsibilities</b> of – on average – 7. 4 hours per week. Nurses with <b>care</b> <b>responsibilities</b> at home were older, worked more often part-time, less often in night shifts and more frequently in nursing homes or ambulatory care services than the nurses without <b>care</b> <b>responsibilities</b> at home. Furthermore, lower work ability (p = 0. 023) and a higher disability due to neck and back pain (p = 0. 001) was found for nurses with private <b>care</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> Unexpectedly, no group differences were found for burnout, general health, job satisfaction, work-familiy and family work conflict. Conclusion: Nurses with additional private <b>care</b> <b>responsibilities</b> should be recognised as a particular occupational target group for preventive measures considering physical risks. Our indications found for a potentially supportive psychological function of professional work among nurses with private caring obligations may constitute a challenge for work organisation in health care and for science. <br/...|$|R

Using in-depth interviews, this study explores the role of social capital, here referred to as 'care capital', in {{making it possible for}} working lone mothers to combine their roles as family carers and workers. Eleven divorced or widowed mothers combining their paid work with long-term <b>care</b> <b>responsibilities</b> were recruited from a survey or through NGOs and were interviewed at their home between October 2008 and July 2010. An interpretative phenomenological approach was adopted for data analysis. The findings revealed that the mothers' care capital was extremely limited and was lost, gained and lost again during their life-cycles of long-term care-giving. Guanxi, especially in relation to their employers, proved to be the sole source of care capital for these mothers, making reconciliation between work and <b>care</b> <b>responsibilities</b> possible. In the absence of formal or informal support, religion and the mother-child relationship seemed also to become a kind of care capital for these lone mothers, helping them to get by with their life-long <b>care</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> For formal social and healthcare services, not just in Taiwan but in every country, it is important to develop support for lone mothers of adults with ID who have long-term <b>care</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and low levels of care capital and thus face care poverty...|$|R

50|$|Male {{and female}} pygmy {{marmosets}} show differences in foraging and feeding behavior, although {{male and female}} dominance and aggressive behavior varies within the species. Males have less time to search out food sources and forage due to the constraints of their infant <b>caring</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and predator vigilance. Without an infant to carry, female pygmy marmosets have greater freedom to forage, giving them an apparent feeding priority. This priority may serve to compensate mothers for the energetic costs of carrying and lactating for two offspring at a time. However, the fact that feeding priority is also given to females without offspring weakens the argument. Instead, female feeding priority may have evolved through sexual selection. Females may choose mates who invest more time in infant care and predator vigilance. Such males have less time to look for food, allowing the female feeding priority.|$|E

Semistructured in-depth interviews were conducted (16 hours of recorded material) with eight parents who were all members of the Interest Association for Schizophrenia (Intresseforeningen for Schizofreni (IFS)) in Sweden. A mixed hermeneutic deductive and inductive method was used for the interpretation of the material. The parents endow their informal <b>caring</b> <b>responsibility</b> with meaning of being a good, responsible, and accountable parent with respect to their social context and social relationships as well as with respect to the psychiatric care representatives. In this tense situation, parents compromise between elements of struggle, cooperation, avoidance, and adaption in their interaction with the world outside, meaning the world beyond the care provision for their child, as well as with the world inside themselves...|$|R

50|$|According to the Close the Gap Project, {{there are}} several reasons for {{differences}} in pay; the first one being that jobs are segregated regarding to gender. So it is normal to press men and women into stereotypical male or female occupations. The majority of women (72%) are employed in public administration, education and health. Typical male jobs are handy work, mechanical work with the 89% of male employees working in the field of construction http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/Equality/18500/StatisticsWomenMenScot#a6. It can also be seen that in high management position the percentage of men working there is higher than that of women working in similar positions. Another reason for the Pay Gap is the caring responsibility of women. As many workplaces lack flexible schedules women with <b>caring</b> <b>responsibilities</b> towards old or sick relatives, children or disabled {{people are more likely to}} look for part-time work which allows them to be more flexible. This can also be seen when having a closer look at the statistics. According to Esther Breitenbach and Fran Wasoff (A Gender Audit of Statistics: Comparing the Position of Women and Men in Scotland) about 55% of women work part-time as it is one of the work arrangements with flexible working hours, compared to only 22% of men who do use this work arrangement.|$|E

The curriculum is tailored {{to suit the}} special needs of individual children and {{the focus is on the}} functional needs of the pupils for the present and the future. Areas of learning include language communication, functional academics such as time telling, money value, self-help skills and personal grooming, social competency and pre-vocational skills. To promote the holistic development of pupils, the schools have within their curriculum time, physical education, music and swimming. A multidisciplinary team of Allied Health Professionals in each school, such as psychologists, social workers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech therapists, ensures a holistic approach to the development of pupils and support for their families.3 Employment and Development Centres (EDCs)The Employment Development Centres continuously seek to increase their diversity of contract work, in-house industries, social enterprises and job placements into open employment for persons with intellectual disability. These efforts go towards providing income for the trainees to pay for their own transport, food and leisure. But more importantly, with jobs to do, persons with intellectual disability can hold their heads high in society as ‘contributors’.6 Training and Development Centres (TDCs)The Training and Development Centres service clients with more challenging behaviours, or have a greater degree of special needs that require continuous professional help. Extensive training is provided through a multi-disciplinary team to modify behaviours and improve independent living skills so that some may eventually be transferred to sheltered workshops or even prepared for open employment.2 Residential Homes (one for adults, one for children) + 1 Hostel/Group Home (for adults)MINDSville@Napiri is a multi-service centre in Lorong Napiri run by MINDS.

Their role is to act as a bridge between the Investigation Officer and the police detainee/suspect/witness to enable him/her to communicate more effectively during the police interview. This means that the police detainee/suspect/witness does not misunderstand the questions asked or that he/she is not misunderstood by the Investigation Officer, ensuring that statements recorded are reliable.All applicants will have to attend a mandatory one-day training session and selection process. Training sessions will be held depending on demand, and the dates will be publicised.|$|E

This article aims to explore to what extent women’s <b>care</b> <b>responsibilities</b> for children and older people impact on women’s labour market integration and how this impact differs in the context of different welfare states in Europe and Asia. The analysis is based on data from a new comparative survey for four cities (Jyväskylä, Hamburg, Bologna and Hsinchu) in four countries (Finland, Germany, Italy and Taiwan). While socio-economic and demographic factors (age, education, marital status, health, financial difficulty and cultural orientation) are considered, multinomial regression reveals that, concerning childcare, the differences are greater within Europe than between the European countries and the Asian welfare state included in the study. Moreover, it turns out that there is no association between caring for older relatives and female employment in any of the four societies. This study demonstrates that the impact of different types of <b>care</b> <b>responsibilities</b> on women’s employment shows different directions and conditions in the context of different welfare states...|$|R
