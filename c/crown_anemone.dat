5000|$|Anemone coronaria means <b>crown</b> <b>anemone,</b> {{referring}} to the central crown of the flower, evoking regal associations. The Arabic name is shaqa'iq An-Nu'man translated literally as the wounds, or [...] "pieces", of Nu'man. [...] One possible source of the name traces back to the Sumerian god of food and vegetation, Tammuz, whose Phoenician epithet was [...] "Nea'man". [...] Tammuz is generally considered to have been drawn into the Greek pantheon as Adonis, who died of his wounds while hunting wild boar. The deity {{is transformed into a}} flower, stained by the blood of Adonis. Tammuz's Phoenician epithet [...] "Nea'man" [...] is believed to be both the source of [...] "an-Nu'man" [...] in Arabic which came through Syriac, and of [...] "anemone" [...] which came through Greek. Another possible source of the name is An-Nu'man III Bin Al-Munthir, the last Lakhmid king of Al-Hirah (582-c.609 AD) and a Christian Arab. An-Nu'man is known to have protected the flowers during his reign. According to myth, the flower thrived on An-Nu'man's grave, paralleling the death and rebirth of Adonis.|$|E

Faculty of Horticulture, Chiba University, Matsudo, Japan. Tech. Bull. Fac. Hort. Chiba Univ., No. 15 : 27 〜 32, 1967. According to SAMATA 2 ̆ 7 s reports (1959 -b, etc.) double flowered cosmos can be {{transformed}} to single-flowered type when grown in a high temperature biotrone chamber at 30 ℃. Sometimes, however, in the garden, we can find double flowering cosmos plants with both normal double and partly-doubled flowers having fertile stamens. When examining these individual double plants closely, {{it was found that}} there were various types of flowers ranging from <b>anemone,</b> <b>crown</b> to pompon forms. In October, 1961, under natural conditions, these various forms of doubles on a plant, except a pompon type (DD), were obtained by promoting the growth of dormant buds near the base of plants with the methods of laying down the main stems and pinching which were practiced in mid-August. This was made in the hope of obtaining high double-yielding plants by crossing of double flowers (Dd+MD_ 1, MD_ 2, and so on) with the transformed single-one in the phenotype and doubles in genotype (Dd), and this would be useful from the standpoint of commercial seed production of double cosmos. In this study, of interest was the observation that in some clonal strains, each of branches within a plant had different types of flowers, except a pompon form. Another point of interest to note was that the flower type variation was accompanied by variation of leaf type from coarse (double flowers) to fine (single) pinnate leaves within a plant...|$|R
