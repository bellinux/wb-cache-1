Without using extra power switches to increase the control dimension, the proposed converter uses a flyback converter with dual-output transformer to achieve the control purpose.

40|$|The goal of all-electric powered {{vehicles}} {{is mostly}} still thwarted by the closely limited electric capacity of battery and <b>capacitor</b> <b>storage</b> systems. This applies especially to buses of urban public transport. A significant break-through of electric energy storage technologies regarding {{this issue is}} not to be expected within the next decade. In spite of these pre-considerations the only way to realize a non wire-bound electric urban bus system is to recharge the electric storage during the everyday operation. Therefore it is necessary to build up a network of boost-charging stations which are integrated in selected bus-stops. This requires additionally a highcurrent contact system and a fully automated re-charging process without any intervention by the driving staff or any other person. Furthermore the re-charging as well as the normal driving operation has to proceed without any influence or interfere either to the conventional route service of the bus nor to normal road traffic or infrastructures. Beside dimensioning the electric storage systems and power electronics of the e-bus {{as well as of the}} boost-charging stations and designing a high-current contact system, another major focus lays on the automation of the entire process. This includes the required communication between e-bus and boost-charging station, the mutual detection and identification and the needed sensor and actuator systems...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} simulation {{and experimental}} results for a 1400 A, ± 900 V peak rated, switch mode power supply for SNS Injection Kicker Magnets. For each magnet (13 mΩ, 160 µH), the power supply must supply controlled pulses at 60 Hz repetition rate. The pulse current must rise {{from zero to}} maximum in less than 1 millisec {{in a controlled manner}}, flat top for up to 2 millisec, and should fall in a controlled manner to less than 4 A within 500 µs. The low current performance during fall time is the biggest challenge in this power supply. The simulation results show that to meet the controlled fall of the current and the current ripple requirements, voltage loop bandwidth of at least 10 kHz and switching frequency of at least 100 kHz are required. To achieve high power high frequency switching with IGBT switches, a series connected topology with three phase shifted (0 °, 60 ° & 120 °) converters each with 40 kHz switching frequency (IGBT at 20 kHz), has been achieved. In this paper, the circuit topology, relevant system specifications and experimental results that meet the requirements of the power supply are described in detail.

40|$|Matrix {{converters}} (MCs) {{are essentially}} forced commutated cycloconverters with inherent four quadrant operation {{consisting of a}} matrix of bidirectional switches such {{that there is a}} switch for each possible connection between the input and output lines. Matrix converter directly converts the AC input voltage at any given frequency to AC output voltage with arbitrary amplitude at any unrestricted frequency without the need for a dc link <b>capacitor</b> <b>storage</b> element at the input side. The introduction of bidirectional switches using power transistors and IGBTs made easy realization of the matrix converter. The real development of the matrix converter starts with the work of Venturini and Alesina who proposed a mathematical analysis and introduced the Low-Frequency Modulation Matrix concept to describe the low frequency behavior of the matrix converter [1 - 3]. In this, the output voltages are obtained by multiplication of the modulation matrix or transfer matrix with the input voltages. One of the essential requirements for switching three phase AC to three phase AC MC is that two or more bidirectional switches connected to any one output phase should NOT be closed simultaneously, as this will cause dangerously high short circuit current. Similarly any one bidirectional switch connected to each output phase should remain closed to provide a current path with inductive load. This thesis mainly provides an account of the three phase AC to three phase AC MC modelling concept with SIMULINK software using fundamental Venturini and Optimum Venturini modulation algorithm [1 - 8], advanced modulation algorithm such as that proposed by Sunter-Clare [11 - 12] and by Ned Mohan [13 - 14, 16 - 17], application of these algorithms for the Vector control of three phase Induction Motor (IM) drive [15], real time hardware in the loop simulation [51, 54 - 55] for a three phase AC to single phase AC MC, three phase AC to three phase AC Multilevel MC (MMC) with three [18 - 19] and six flying capacitors per output phase using PSCAD software (as SIMULINK started shooting trouble), Indirect (ISVM) [25 - 30] and Direct (DASVM, DSSVM, CZASVM) [31 - 38] Space Vector Modulation, newly discovered dual programmable AC to DC rectifier concept using three phase AC to three phase AC MC [43 - 45], Delta-Sigma Modulated MC [46 - 49] and single phase AC to three phase AC MC [50].
