5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Francis Lawrence. The video opens within a black cube {{with an array of}} different <b>colored</b> <b>lights</b> with several people dancing. The video inter-cuts to Justin Timberlake singing to the song. Timberlake then floats to the floor from an opening in the cubic's ceiling, performing choreography with his supporting dancers and singing to the track's first verse. Throughout the video, it inter-cuts to Timberlake dancing by himself, with the sections sometimes featuring the camera panning around Timberlake's face. Entering the second verse, Timberlake is in the cube on his own, manipulating the motion of the cube with his hands, with his legs following the moving platform. Timberlake then returns performing choreography again with his dancers. Following the second chorus, Timberlake is dancing with a female (Staci Flood), who lip syncs Vanessa Marquez's section. A break-down of the song, where Timberlake is beatboxing, shows him dancing by himself. The beatboxing section of the song is only available in the music video version, the album version cuts the beatboxing out. The breakdown then ends, with the video continuing with Timberlake and his back-up dancers. The closing beat boxing section of the track features the camera panning around several duplicates of Timberlake beatboxing and talking in sync to the song's lyrics. The video ends with the final Timberlake duplicate pointing and running towards the opposite direction.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} color are already being used widely. For this reason, in this study, {{an attempt was made}} to use such effects of color to examine the changes in sleep onset through the use of the {{preferred}} and nonpreferred <b>color</b> <b>light</b> stimulation. <b>Color</b> <b>light</b> stimulations were randomly presented to the subjects, and based on these colors, the changes in sleep onset were examined through the EEG. Also, to quantify the physiological changes that were caused by each <b>color</b> <b>light</b> stimulation, the changes in the HRV were examined through ECG to determine the level of activation of the autonomous nervous system. The results showed that sleep onset time was changed based on the light stimulation. The result of the EEG analysis showed that sleep onset time was most significantly shortened in preferred <b>color</b> <b>light</b> stimulation. Also, the result of HRV was the fastest change about both the time domain and the frequency domain in the preferred <b>color</b> <b>light</b> stimulation. Therefore, because the preferred <b>color</b> <b>light</b> stimulation activated the parasympathetic nervous system, sleep was induced quickly. Also, by simply using the HRV, the differences in the index of HRV showed changes of sleep onset according to the <b>color</b> <b>light</b> stimulation...|$|R

25|$|By nighttime, Nafshi {{was placed}} {{under the command of}} the 7th Brigade. The Syrians kept {{advancing}} in columns, using <b>colored</b> <b>lights</b> and flags to distinguish units. Some of them struck Israeli minefields. The Israeli forces did not have adequate optical equipment for night fighting, and had to gauge the position of the Syrian forces by their noise and artillery flares. Nafshi's battalion kept changing positions to avoid tank hunters. The fortifications were under heavy attack by tanks and infantry and were calling for help. Nafshi told them to go underground and provided them with supporting artillery fire.|$|E
25|$|Baird {{performed}} one of {{the earliest}} public demonstrations of color television system on 3 July 1928 using an all-mechanical system with three Nipkow disk scanners synchronized with a single disk on the receiving end and three <b>colored</b> <b>lights</b> that were turned on and off in synchronicity with the broadcaster. The same basic system was used on 4 February 1938 to create the first color broadcast transmissions from The Crystal Palace to the Dominion Theatre in London. Baird {{was not the only one}} to experiment with mechanical color television, and a number of similar devices were demonstrated throughout this period, but Baird is recorded as the first to show a real over-the-air transmission in a public demonstration.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the Williams process, invented by cinematographer Frank D. Williams, {{did not require}} a system of <b>colored</b> <b>lights</b> and {{could be used for}} wider shots. It was used in the scene where Kong is shaking the sailors off the log, as well as the scene where Kong pushes the gates open. The Williams process did not use bipacking, but rather an optical printer, the first such device that {{synchronized}} a projector with a camera, so that several strips of film could be combined into a single composted image. Through the use of the optical printer, the special effects crew could film the foreground, the stop-motion animation, the live-action footage, and the background, and combine all of those elements into one single shot. The optical printer would continue to be used for films until the late 1980s, when they were superseded by digital composting.|$|E

The video is composed of several scenes where the camera's distance grows closer to the performers, showing scenes sequentially closer in time to the beat of the song. While some of these takes were shot in daylight, others were taken in darkness, while the band or Yamaguchi were lit by <b>colored</b> <b>lights.</b> In {{the latter part of the}} video, it is revealed that the view of the band is from the perspective of a high school girl (played by actress and model Yui Miura), who wears binoculars to view the band. The camera then focuses on the girl using the same technique that the band was shot in. The girl finds Yamaguchi performing the song directly in front of her, and finally decides to run away.|$|E

Known to staff as [...] "Manhattan Project", the shots of various nebula-like phenomena, including the expanding star field, were colored paints and chemicals swirling in a pool-like device known as a cloud tank, shot in slow-motion in a dark room. The live-action landscape shots in the 'Star Gate' sequence were filmed in the Hebridean islands, the mountains of northern Scotland, and Monument Valley. The coloring and negative-image effects were achieved {{by the use of}} different color filters in the process of making duplicate negatives.|$|E

500|$|During its daily two-minute sequence, which {{includes}} a trumpet fanfare, mist, and flashing lights, the machine displays one of three metal symbols as a prediction of the weather for the following 24-hour period: a sun for clear and sunny weather, a blue heron for drizzle and transitional weather, or a dragon and mist for rainy or stormy weather. The sculpture includes two bronze wind scoops and displays the temperature via vertical <b>colored</b> <b>lights</b> along its stem. The air quality index is also displayed by a light system below the stainless steel globe. Weather predictions are made based on information obtained by employees of Pioneer Courthouse Square from the National Weather Service and the Department of Environmental Quality. Considered a tourist attraction, Weather Machine has been called [...] "bizarre", [...] "playful", [...] "unique", and [...] "wacky", and {{has been compared to}} a giant scepter.|$|E
500|$|The machine, whose {{height is}} {{reported}} to be between , includes two bronze wind scoops that turn in opposite directions. It also indicates the temperature (when 20 °F or above) via vertical <b>colored</b> <b>lights</b> along the sculpture's stem. Measured by an internal gauge, the machine displays blue lights for below freezing, white lights for above freezing and red lights to mark every ten degrees (°F). Referring to an additional light system (below the stainless steel globe) that indicates air quality, The Oregonian reported in 1988 that a green light indicates good air quality, amber reflects [...] "semismoggy" [...] air and a red light indicates poor air quality. However, in 1998 one writer for The Oregonian warned: [...] "you don't want to breathe so much when the white light is on". Pioneer Courthouse Square employees enter air quality information into the machine's computer following routine checks with the Department of Environmental Quality.|$|E
500|$|Beyond Marne, I-96 {{passes the}} western end of M-11 and crosses into Kent County, curving around a rest area for the {{eastbound}} lanes.
