6000|$|This {{was much}} to the point, and Catherine was struck by it. [...] "I will try not to be," [...] she said. And she stood there submissively, the image, in advance, of a dutiful and {{responsible}} wife. This image could not fail to recommend itself to Morris Townsend, and he continued to give proof of the high estimation in which he held her. It {{could only have been}} at the prompting of such a sentiment that he presently mentioned to her that the <b>course</b> <b>recommended</b> by Mrs. Penniman was an immediate union, regardless of consequences.|$|E
60|$|He {{knew not}} what to do. It seemed absurd now {{to go to}} her father next morning, as he had purposed, and ask for an {{engagement}} with her, a possibility impending all the while that Elfride herself would not be on his side. Only one <b>course</b> <b>recommended</b> itself as wise. To wait and see what the days would bring forth; to go and execute his commissions in Birmingham; then to return, learn if anything had happened, and try what a meeting might do; perhaps her surprise at his backwardness would bring her forward to show latent warmth as decidedly as in old times.|$|E
60|$|If now, {{the teacher}} has taken the <b>course</b> <b>recommended</b> in this chapter; if he has, by his general {{influence}} in the school, done all {{in his power to}} bring the majority of his pupils to the side of order and discipline; if he has then studied, attentively and impartially, the characters of those who cannot thus be led; if he has endeavored to make them his friends, and to acquire, by every means, a personal influence over them; if, finally, when they do wrong, he goes, plainly, but in a gentle and delicate manner, to them, and lays before them the whole case; if he has done all this, he has gone as far as moral influence will carry him. My opinion is, that this course, faithfully and judiciously pursued, will in almost all instances succeed; but it will not in all; and where it fails, there must be other, and more vigorous and decided measures. What these measures of restraint or punishment shall be, must depend upon the circumstances of the case; but in resorting to them, the teacher must be decided and unbending.|$|E

60|$|But when Elizabeth told of his silence; it did {{not seem}} very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the {{difficulty}} of finding anything to do, which was the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of <b>course</b> <b>recommended</b> him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.|$|E
60|$|The same {{differences}} existed about the comparative excellence {{of the three}} metals and the portions of the body which they respectively formed. Some admired the gold, and maintained {{that if it were}} not for the head the Statue would be utterly useless; others preferred the silver, and would assert that the body, which contained all the machinery, must clearly be the most precious portion; while a third party triumphantly argued that the iron legs which supported both body and head must surely be the most valuable part, since without them the Statue must fall. The first party advised that in all future reparations gold only should be introduced; and the other parties, of <b>course,</b> <b>recommended</b> with equal zeal their own favourite metals. It is observable, however, that if, under these circumstances, the iron race chanced to fail in carrying their point, they invariably voted for gold in preference to silver. But the most contradictory opinions, perhaps, were those which were occasioned by the instruments with which the Statue was armed and supported. Some affected to be so frightened by the mere sight of the brandished sword, although it never moved, that they pretended it was dangerous to live even under the same sky with it; while others, treating very lightly the terrors of this warlike instrument, would observe that much more was really to be apprehended from the remarkable strength and thickness of the calm and peace-inspiring crosier; and that as long as the Government was supported by this huge pastoral staff nothing could prevail against it; that it could dare all things, and even stand without the help of its legs. All these various opinions at least proved that, although the present might not be the most miraculous Statue that could possibly be created, it was nevertheless quite impossible ever to form one which would please all parties.|$|E

She {{was one of the first}} navigators to exploit the insights of Matthew Fontaine Maury, most notably the <b>course</b> <b>recommended</b> in his Sailing Directions.

5000|$|With Britain in {{economic}} crisis in October 1976, Benn put forward the AES in Cabinet with the partial support of Peter Shore.

It is compatible with our strategy. You withdraw behind walls and reconstruct and re-emerge". Benn further said that both courses were a [...] "siege economy" [...] but the difference is that in the monetarist course [...] "you will have the bankers with you and the British people, the trade unions, outside the citadel storming you; with mine it will be the other way round". However the Cabinet rejected the AES (along with two other proposals) on 1/2 December and accepted the terms for a loan from the International Monetary Fund on 12 December.|$|E
5000|$|One {{point in}} regard to which {{improvement}} is obviously desirable is the axiom of reducibility (*12.1.11).

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} at Merrimack College in Massachusetts to compare the grades of students who took the <b>recommended</b> <b>course</b> as determined by their mathematics placement exam score {{and those who did}} not follow this recommendation. The goal was to decide whether the mathematics placement exam used at Merrimack College was effective in placing students in the appropriate mathematics class. During five years, first-year students who took a mathematics course in the fall semester were categorized into four groups: those who took the <b>recommended</b> <b>course,</b> those who took an easier <b>course</b> than <b>recommended,</b> those who took a course more difficult than recommended, {{and those who did not}} take the placement test.

50|$|On October 23, 1878 Dull Knife's band of Cheyenne, in a {{blinding}} snowstorm, {{discovered that they}} were surrounded by the army; the encounter was accidental, neither party having seen the other due to the snow. Dull Knife convinced his band not to attack the soldiers. The army offered some food and a few blankets to the Cheyenne and suggested a move to a better camp nearby at Fort Robinson in northwestern Nebraska. There the army confiscated the Cheyenne ponies but distributed more rations, including sugar and coffee. The next morning after a two-hour council, the Cheyenne agreed to turn over their weapons. However they turned over only the older ones, concealing many. After hearing that Red Cloud and Spotted Tail had been relocated to Pine Ridge, Dull Knife decided, due to the weather and his people's condition, to go to Fort Robinson. The Cheyenne decided that night to take apart their best guns, women hid the barrels under their clothing and the smaller pieces were attached to cloths and moccasins as ornaments. Without telling the Cheyenne, it was determined by November 22 by Carl Schurz, the Secretary of the Interior that the Cheyenne would {{be returned to the}} south.
