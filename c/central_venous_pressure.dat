5|$|A special but unusual {{consideration}} is cardiogenic shock, where {{the blood pressure}} is decreased not due to dehydration but due to inability of the heart to pump blood through the blood vessels. This situation requires ICU admission, monitoring of the <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>pressure</b> (which requires the insertion of a central venous catheter in a large upper body vein), and the administration of medication that increases the heart pumping action and blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|By {{attaching}} {{both the}} injector {{site and the}} ventricular thermistor to a small computer, the thermodilution curve can be plotted. If details about the patient's body mass index (size); core temp, Systolic, diastolic, <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>pressure</b> CVP (measured from the atrium by the third lumen simultaneously) and pulmonary artery pressure are input, a comprehensive flow vs pressure map can be calculated.|$|E
25|$|Other {{advantages}} are {{that because it}} empties near the heart, medications can also be quickly distributed {{to the rest of}} the body. As there is room for multiple parallel compartments (lumen) within the catheter, so that multiple medications can be delivered at once even if they would not be chemically compatible within a single tube. Caregivers can also measure <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>pressure</b> and other physiological variables through the line. It is commonly believed that fluid can be pushed faster through a central venous catheter but as they are often divided into multiple lumens then the internal diameter is less than that of a large-bore peripheral cannula. They are also longer, which as reflected in Poiseuille's law, requires higher pressure to achieve the same flow, all other variables being equal.|$|E

A correct estimation of volume status and so-called dry weight in dialysis patients remains a difficult clinical problem. Clinical status and chest X-ray are not sensitive enough, while invasively meas-ured <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>pressures</b> are not routinely avail-able. Recently, the sonographic {{determination of the}} diameter and collapse of the inferior vena cava (IVC) has been proposed as a noninvasive method for estim-ating intravascular volume.

40|$|Twelve {{dogs were}} divided into four groups: Group I-simple {{interruption}} of the portal vein for 40 minutes; Group II-interruption of the portal vein combined with interruption of the superior mesenteric artery for 40 minutes; Group III-simple interruption of the portal vein for 60 minutes; Group IV-interruption of the portal vein combined with interruption of the superior mesenteric artery for 60 minutes. The arterial, <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>pressures,</b> arterial blood pH, blood suger, serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and leucine aminopeptidase values were measured at various intervals during the experiment. The arterial and <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>pressures</b> and portal <b>venous</b> <b>pressure</b> rose abruptly during and immediately after the interruption. All the dogs were hemodynamically more stable in Groups II and IV than in Groups I and III. The arterial bllod pH levels fell to 7. 2 - 7. 3 during the interruption and reached their lowest values 60 minutes after release of the interruption. The SGOT, SGPT and leucine aminopeptidase increased after interruption of the portal vein, though these levels Were higher in Groups I and III than in Groups II and IV. Consequently, it seems safe to interrupt both the portal vein and the superior mesenteric artery during portal vein reconstruction in periampullary cancer of the pancreas...|$|R
25|$|Patients {{under general}} {{anesthesia}} must undergo continuous physiological monitoring to ensure safety. In the US, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) have established minimum monitoring guidelines for patients receiving general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or sedation. This includes electrocardiography (ECG), heart rate, blood pressure, inspired and expired gases, oxygen saturation {{of the blood}} (pulse oximetry), and temperature. In the UK the Association of Anaesthetists (AAGBI) have set minimum monitoring guidelines for general and regional anesthesia. For minor surgery, this generally includes monitoring of heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and inspired and expired concentrations for oxygen, carbon dioxide, and inhalational anesthetic agents. For more invasive surgery, monitoring may also include temperature, urine output, blood pressure, <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>pressure,</b> pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, cardiac output, cerebral activity, and neuromuscular function. In addition, the operating room environment must be monitored for ambient temperature and humidity, {{as well as for}} accumulation of exhaled inhalational anesthetic agents, which might be deleterious to the health of operating room personnel.|$|E

The ICU and hospital mortalities, the length of stay, the use of vasopressors, and the fluid balance were also registered. We measured the heart rate, the arterial and <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>pressures,</b> and the cardiac output. The intra-abdominal pressure was measured {{by means of a}} urinary catheter after the instillation of 25 mL of saline solution. All pressure measurements were performed at the end of expiration.

30|$|The {{study had}} some limitations. It was an {{observational}} analysis done {{at a single}} institution. There was potential selection bias on the limited convenient sample enrolled.

Instead the volume status was determined by the treating ICU physician, using subjective and objective data including CVP, blood pressure, heart rate, urine output, radiographs in determining the ICU patient to be euvolemic or hypovolemic. Another limitation, the intensivist point-of-care sonographers performing the study were not blinded to the volume status of the patient, which can lead to bias in measurements.|$|R

40|$|Objective: to {{evaluate}} the effect of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in intracranial hypertension in an experiment using a biological model. Materials and methods. The experiment was carried out on 10 pigs aged 2 months and weighing 17 — 20 kg. The experimental animals were anesthetized. The authors monitored the following parameters: invasive arterial and <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>pressures,</b> intracranial pressure (ICP), and peak inspiratory pressure. ICP was simulated with a subdurally placed balloon. During mechanical ventilation (MV), PEEP was gradually increased up to 5, 10, 15, and 20 cm H 2 O. Results. PEEP elevation during MV {{was accompanied by a}} progressive rise in intrathoracic pressure and a reduction in mean blood pressure. When PEEP was increased, there was a significant rise in ICP in the intact brain and basic subcompensated intracranial hypertension; no statistically significant change in ICP was observed in decompensated intracranial hypertension. The safe PEEP with regard to CPP was determined by the severity of basic intracranial distention (it was 15 cm H 2 O in the intact brain and 10 cm H 2 O in subcompensated hypertension); PEEP exerted no significant effect on CPP in decompensated intracranial hypertension. Conclusion. The effect of PEEP on CPP is determined by not only the value of PEEP, but also by the severity of brain damage.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{hormonal}} alterations that may mediate the systemic hypertension that develops in patients during the perioperative period of orthotopic liver transplantation. We studied nine pediatric patients without previous hypertension or renal disease during six time points, starting before transplantation and ending at 48 hours after surgery. Hypertension developed in all patients in association with <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>pressures</b> < 10 mm Hg. Free water clearance was negative in all nine patients. Vasopressin levels increased intraoperatively but fell as hypertension developed. Atrial natriuretic factor levels increased as systemic blood pressure rose. A high level of plasma renin activity was observed in four patients with renal insufficiency. In six patients, postoperative 24 -hour urinary norepinephrine excretion was within the normal age-adjusted range. These findings suggest that the combination of cyclosporine, corticosteroids, and, in some patients, an elevated plasma renin activity prevents the kidney from responding to the acute volume and salt overload with an appropriate diuresis and natriuresis, thus leading to systemic hypertension. The treatment of hypertension after liver transplantation may include salt restriction, diuretics, and, in those patients with a low creatinine excretion index, anglotensin coverting enzyme inhibitors. © 1989 The C.
