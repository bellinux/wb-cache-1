However, weight of a contact wire increases with a larger cross sectional area. We thus reviewed the balance between the cross sectional area and the tension of the contact wire for the heavy <b>compound</b> <b>catenary</b> system shown in Fig. 1, the standard overhead contact line system for the Tohoku and Joetsu Shinkansen, while keeping the total tension as it was. And we modified that heavy <b>compound</b> <b>catenary</b> system in the section between Sendai and Kitakami to the system shown in Table 1. The contact wireâ€™s weight was reduced and tension increased when modifying the existing system to the improved system (and respectively in Table 1). Changing the allocation of tension to each line of the system {{made it possible to}} modify withou...|$|E
