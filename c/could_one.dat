They threatened to lynch Keseberg, who confessed that he had cached $273 of the Donners' money at Tamsen's suggestion, so that it <b>could</b> <b>one</b> day benefit her children. On April 29, 1847, Keseberg was the last member of the Donner Party to arrive at Sutter's Fort.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} some debate over the {{relationship}} of Mammuthus to Loxodonta or Elephas. Some DNA studies suggest Mammuthus is {{more closely related to}} the former while others point to the latter. However, analysis of the complete mitochondrial genome profile of the woolly mammoth (sequenced in 2005) supports Mammuthus being more closely related to Elephas. Morphological evidence supports Mammuthus and Elephas as sister taxa while comparisons of protein albumin and collagen have concluded that all three genera are equally related to each other. Some scientists believe a cloned mammoth embryo <b>could</b> <b>one</b> day be implanted in an Asian elephant's womb.|$|E

25|$|An {{offshore}} wind farm is currently under construction off {{the east coast}} near Arklow, and many remote locations in the west show potential for wind farm development. A report by Sustainable Energy Ireland indicated that if wind power were properly developed, Ireland <b>could</b> <b>one</b> day be exporting excess wind power if the natural difficulties of integrating wind power into the national grid are solved. Wind power by November 2009 already accounted for 15.4% of total installed generating capacity in the state. By 2020, the Irish government forecasts that 40% of the country's energy needs will come from renewable sources, well above the EU average.|$|E
25|$|Instead of {{focusing}} on talking to the Turks, Ribbentrop and Papen became entangled in a feud over Papen's demand that he by-pass Ribbentrop and send his dispatches straight to Hitler. As a former Chancellor, Papen had granted this privilege of by-passing the Foreign Minister while he was Ambassador to Austria. Ribbentrop's friendship with Papen, which went back to 1918, ended over this issue. At the same time, Ribbentrop took to shouting at the Turkish Ambassador in Berlin, Mehemet Hamdi Arpag, {{as part of the}} effort to win Turkey over as a German ally. Ribbentrop believed that Turks were so stupid that only by shouting at them <b>could</b> <b>one</b> make them understand. One of the consequences of Ribbentrop's heavy-handed behaviour was the signing of the Anglo-Turkish alliance of 12 May 1939.|$|E

25|$|Some life extensionists {{suggest that}} {{therapeutic}} cloning and {{stem cell research}} <b>could</b> <b>one</b> day provide a way to generate cells, body parts, or even entire bodies (generally referred to as reproductive cloning) that would be genetically identical to a prospective patient. Recently, the US Department of Defense initiated a program to research the possibility of growing human body parts on mice. Complex biological structures, such as mammalian joints and limbs, {{have not yet been}} replicated. Dog and primate brain transplantation experiments were conducted in the mid-20th century but failed due to rejection and the inability to restore nerve connections. As of 2006, the implantation of bio-engineered bladders grown from patients' own cells {{has proven to be a}} viable treatment for bladder disease. Proponents of body part replacement and cloning contend that the required biotechnologies are likely to appear earlier than other life-extension technologies.|$|E
500|$|At {{this time}} [...] there begins to be {{noticeable}} a considerable cooling off and even somewhat inimical {{attitude toward the}} memory of the [...] "mighty kuchka" [...] of Balakirev's period.

Nor <b>could</b> <b>one</b> help noticing the predilection (that sprang up then in our circle) for Italian-French music of the time of wig and farthingale , music introduced by Tchaikovsky in his Queen of Spades and Iolanthe.

500|$|Palestine is {{the only}} region for which an {{extended}} local perspective of the persecution exists, {{in the form of}} Eusebius's Martyrs of Palestine. Eusebius was resident in Caesarea, the capital of Roman Palestine, {{for the duration of the}} persecution, although he also traveled to Phoenicia and Egypt, and perhaps Arabia as well. Eusebius's account is imperfect. It focuses on martyrs that were his personal friends before the persecutions began, and includes martyrdoms that took place outside of Palestine. His coverage is uneven. He provides only bare generalities at the bloody end of the persecutions, for example. Eusebius recognizes some of his faults. At the outset of his account of the general persecution in the Ecclesiastical History, Eusebius laments the incompleteness of his reportage: [...] "how <b>could</b> <b>one</b> number the multitude of martyrs in each province, and especially those in Africa and Mauretania, and in Thebaid and Egypt?" ...|$|E
