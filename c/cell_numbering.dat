Seismicity for 1000  days has been calculated in each simulation, and the last 500  days are used for the following analysis to reduce biases related to transient behavior at the beginning of each set of calculations. We use the following values for other parameters: rigidity μ[*]=[*] 30  GPa, shear wave velocity β[*]=[*] 3  km/s, effective normal stress σ[*]=[*] 100  MPa, and plate loading velocity Vpl[*]=[*] 10 − 9  m/s. These parameters yield a minimum nucleation size Lb[*]=[*]μDc/bσ of 1.5  m (Rubin and Ampuero 2005). The fault is discretized into subfaults, each with a size of 0.1  m, much shorter than the minimum length required for nucleation. The slip velocity discussed and presented in the following manuscript and figures is averaged within each cell (i.e., spatially averaged in 80  m regions) because we discuss the frictional heterogeneity on scales smaller than the sizes of large earthquakes. Because the system is bilaterally symmetric, only the left half of each fault is shown in the figures.|$|E

Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) acts through receptors (FSHR) on the Sertoli cell to stimulate spermatogenesis while androgens promote testis growth through receptors (AR) on the Sertoli cells, Leydig cells and peritubular myoid cells. In this study we have examined the effects on testis development of ablating FSHRs (FSHRKO mice) and/or ARs ubiquitously (ARKO mice) or specifically on the Sertoli cells (SCARKO mice). <b>Cell</b> <b>numbers</b> were measured using stereological methods. In ARKO mice Sertoli <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> were reduced at all ages from birth until adulthood. FSHR ablation also caused small reductions in Sertoli <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> up to day 20 with more marked effects seen in the adult. Germ <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> were unaffected by FSHR and/or AR ablation at birth. By day 20 ubiquitous AR or FSHR ablation caused a marked reduction in germ <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> with a synergistic effect of losing both receptors (germ <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> in FSHRKO.

40|$|By {{standard}} convention, {{in order}} to increase the efficacy of metabolite detection from cell culture lysates, metabolite extracts from a large quantity of cells are utilized for multiple reaction monitoring-based metabolomic studies. Metabolomics from a small <b>number</b> of <b>cell</b> extracts offers a potential economical alternative to increased <b>cell</b> <b>numbers,</b> in turn increasing the utility of cell culture-based metabolomics. However, the effect of reduced <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> on targeted metabolomic profiling is relatively unstudied. Considering the limited knowledge available of the feasibility and accuracy of microscale cell culture metabolomics, the present study analyzes differences in metabolomic profiles of different <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> of three pancreatic cancer cell lines. Specifically, it examines the effects of reduced <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> on metabolite profiles by obtaining extracts either directly from microscale culture plates or through serial dilution of increased numbers of cellular metabolite extracts. Our results indicate reduced <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> only modestly affect the number of metabolites detected (93 % of metabolites detected in <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> as low as 104 cells and 97 % for 105 cells), independent of the method used to obtain the cells. However, metabolite peak intensities were differentially affected by the reduced <b>cell</b> <b>numbers,</b> with some peak intensities inversely proportional to the <b>cell</b> <b>numbers.</b> To help eliminate such potential inverse relationships, peak intensities for increased <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> were excluded from the comparative analysis. Overall, metabolite profiles from microscale culture plates were observed to differ from the serial dilution samples, which may be attributable to the medium-to-cell-number ratios. Finally, findings identify perturbations in metabolomic profiling for cellular extracts from reduced <b>cell</b> <b>numbers,</b> which offer future applications in microscale metabolomic evaluations...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The role of {{cholecystokinin}} (CCK) and gastrin in {{the development}} and growth of pancreatic cancer cells is controversial. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the role of CCK- 8 S, gastrin- 17, bombesin, and their antagonists on cell lines from patients with pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Cell lines were established from pancreatic cancers operated on at our department. The cells were grown in 10 % fetal calf serum (FCS). The effects of CCK- 8 S, gastrin- 17, bombesin, and their antagonists in different concentrations and for different time intervals were studied. The <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> was evaluated with the XTT method. RESULTS: The cell line LN 36 responded with increased <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> to stimulation by gastrin- 17 and decreased <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> to inhibition by the CCK-B receptor antagonist L- 365, 260. In contrast, LPC 1 responded with increased <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> to CCK- 8 S and decreased <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> to the CCK-A receptor antagonist devazepide. LPC 2, 6, and 7 were stimulated by CCK- 8 S, gastrin- 17, and their antagonists. LPC 3 showed decreased <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> after inhibition by the antagonists, and LPC 5 and 10 showed increased <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> after stimulation by CCK- 8 S and gastrin- 17. LPC 4 was stimulated by CCK- 8 S, and LPC 8 was stimulated by all substances except gastrin- 17. Intermittent administration of the substances to LN 36 led to a greater effect on the <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> than administration every day, which was not the case with LPC 1 and LPC 3. Bombesin led to an increased growth in LPC 5 but not in LPC 3. CONCLUSION: CCK- 8 S and gastrin- 17 led to an increased <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> in some <b>cell</b> lines. A blockade of the CCK-A and CCK-B receptors by their antagonists led to an increased, an unaffected, or a decreased <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> of the <b>cell</b> lines.

Hypoxic neonates had significantly higher NE <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> and medial thickness of the pulmonary arteries at 5 days of age than did normoxic controls; 1 - and 3 -day-old young that died in hypoxia also had significantly higher <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> and medial thickness than did hypoxic survivors. A decline in these <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> was noted between 1 and 5 days of age among normoxic young, whereas {{there was no significant}} change among hypoxic young. Medial thickness was unchanged among normoxic young but increased between 1 and 5 days of age among hypoxic survivors. A 1 -day exposure to normoxia of hypoxic young four days postpartum caused a decrease in NE <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> and medial thickness to more normal values. Serotonin (5 -HT) fluorescence intensity levels of groups of NE cells or neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs) in this group were equal to those of normal controls although these levels were decreased in early chronic hypoxia. Medial thickness and NE <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> were inversely correlated with serotonin levels, suggesting that serotonin may be associated with medial hypertrophy and presence of argyrophil material. Medial thickness was positively correlated with NE <b>cell</b> <b>numbers.</b> The above findings led to the following summary: pulmonary NE cells respond to changes in airway oxygen levels; hypoxia or decreased oxygen is associated with decreased cellular 5 -HT content and an increase in NE <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> by argyrophil stain and medial thickness of pulmonary artery walls. The change to normoxia from hypoxia results in higher cellular 5 -HT content and decreased NE argyrophil <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> along with reduced pulmonary artery wall medial thickness...|$|R

Methodology: Total beta <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> and its distribution over small (, 50 mm), medium, large (. 100 mm) clusters was determined in pancreatic tails of 10 -week-old mice, 2 weeks after PDL or sham. Principal findings: PDL increased total beta cell mass but not total beta <b>cell</b> <b>number.</b> It induced neogenesis of small beta cell clusters (2. 2 -fold higher number) which contained a higher percent proliferating beta cells (1. 9 % Ki 67 +cells) than sham tails (, 0. 2 %); their higher beta <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> represented, 5 % of total beta <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> and was associated with a similar increase in alpha <b>cell</b> <b>number.</b> It is unknown whether the regenerative process is causally related to the inflammatory infiltration in PDL-tails.

40|$|Both {{development}} and evolution under chronic malnutrition lead to reduced adult size in Drosophila. We studied {{the contribution of}} changes in size vs. <b>number</b> of epidermal <b>cells</b> to plastic and evolutionary reduction of wing size in response to poor larval food. We used flies from six populations selected for tolerance to larval malnutrition and from six unselected control populations, raised either under standard conditions or under larval malnutrition. In the control populations, phenotypic plasticity of wing size was mediated by both cell size and <b>cell</b> <b>number.</b> In contrast, evolutionary change in wing size, which was only observed as a correlated response expressed on standard food, was mediated entirely by reduction in <b>cell</b> <b>number.</b> Plasticity of <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> had {{been lost in the}} selected populations, and <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> did not differ between the sexes despite males having smaller wings. Results of this and other experimental evolution studies are consistent with the hypothesis that alleles which increase body size through prolonged growth affect wing size mostly via <b>cell</b> <b>number,</b> whereas alleles which increase size through higher growth rate do so via cell size...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that the in vitro culture (IVC) of {{preimplantation}} embryos is associated with changes in gene expression. It is however, not known if the method of fertilization affects the global pattern of gene expression. We compared the development of mouse blastocysts produced by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) versus blastocysts fertilized in vivo and cultured in vitro from the zygote stage (IVC). At the end of cultivation (96 hrs for blastocyst stage embryos), expanded blastocysts of each group were randomly selected, and ICM and total <b>cells</b> <b>number</b> were differentially stained. The total <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> of blastocysts was estimated by counting {{the total number of}} nuclei using DAPI staining. <b>Cell</b> <b>number</b> for inner <b>cell</b> mass (ICM) was estimated by counting the OCT 4 (POU 5 FL) positive cells. Digitally recombined, composite images were analyzed using the Zeiss Axion Vision software and Zeiss Apotome. All 5 – 10 optical sections were divided using a standard grid over each layer to count all. Comparing the total cells and the ICM <b>cells</b> <b>number,</b> it appears that each method of fertilization has a unique pattern development. The developmental rate and the total <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> of the blastocyst were significantly lower in ICSI versus in vivo fertilized embryos which affect the embryonic developmental rate and the total <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> of blastocysts...|$|R

40|$|Acute illness {{leads to}} {{increased}} GH, but reduced IGF-I secretion, while both are reduced in chronic illness. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic obesity syndrome, with GH deficiency a feature independent of obesity. Reduced GH secretion {{may result from}} decreased hypothalamic release of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH). To quantify hypothalamic GHRH neurone <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> in control subjects with various lengths of premorbid illness duration, PWS and non-PWS obese subjects. We examined GHRH neurones in the infundibular nucleus/median eminence complex of control subjects (n = 26, including four children), PWS (n = 6) and non-PWS (n = 4) obese adults and PWS children (n = 2), by quantitative immunocytochemistry, using postmortem material. We found: (i) higher GHRH <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> during prolonged illness prior to death in both control adults (r = + 0. 62, P = 0. 002, <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> vs. premorbid illness duration) and PWS adults (r = + 0. 90, P = 0. 02); (ii) higher GHRH <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> in female than male adults [by 53 % (95 % confidence interval 28 - 83 %) in controls, P = 0. 005, correcting for premorbid illness duration]; (iii) no difference in GHRH <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> between PWS adults and control or non-PWS obese adults (P = 0. 7 and P = 0. 4, adjusting for sex and illness duration); and (iv) low GHRH <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> in only one PWS child (who had been receiving exogenous GH therapy). These findings suggest continued activation of GHRH neurones during prolonged illness. There {{is no evidence that}} the GH deficiency in PWS results from reduced GHRH <b>cell</b> <b>number,</b> and GHRH neuronal responses to illness and exogenous GH treatment appear normal in PW...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{determination}} of <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> {{is essential for}} the quantitative description of biological processes. The changes should be related to a measurable reference e. g. in the case of cell culture, the viable <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> is a very valuable reference parameter. Indirect methods of cell number/viability measurements may have up to 10 % standard deviation. This can lead to undesirable large deviations in the analysis of "-omics" data as well as time course studies. Such data should be preferably normalized to the exact viable <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> at a given time to allow meaningful interpretation and understanding of the biological processes. Manual counting of <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> is very laborious and not possible in certain experimental setups. We therefore, developed a simple and reliable fluorescence based method with an accuracy of 95 - 98 % for the {{determination of}} the viable <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> in situ. We optimized the seeding cell densities for primary rat hepatocytes for optimal cell adhesion. This will help in efficient use of primary cells which are usually limited in availability. The method will be very useful in the application of "-omics" techniques, especially metabolome analysis where the specific rates of uptake/production of metabolites can be reliably calculated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mucosal mast <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> are {{modulated}} in {{the intestines}} of rodents during parasitic infections. These mast cells can degranulate {{in response to}} worm antigens, and this event has been suggested to play a protective role for the host. To examine whether mast cells in higher animals {{play a role in}} protecting from disseminated parasitic disease, mast <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> and responsiveness to parasite antigens were evaluateed in 5 Erythro-cebus patas infected with the human intestinal nematode Strongyloides stercoralis. Initial infection and subsequent challenge infections were associated with increases in jejunal histamine and mast <b>cell</b> <b>numbers,</b> and these mast cells could release histamine in response to parasite antigens. Jejunal mast <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> returned to normal during a chronic phase of infection. The cells lost their ability to respond to antigenic stimulation following limited steroid treatment. Subsequent activation of chronic infections to fatal disseminated disease by more prolonged steroid treatment was associated with a marked decrease in jejunal mast <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> and histamine. In one animal which succumbed to severe disease without steroid treatment, jejunal mast cells were refractory to worm antigens. Consistent features of the host response to i...|$|R
40|$|In {{regenerative}} medicine studies, cell seeding efficiency {{is not only}} optimized by changing the chemistry of the biomaterials used as cell culture substrates, but also by altering scaffold geometry, culture and seeding conditions. In this study, the importance of seeding parameters, such as initial <b>cell</b> <b>number,</b> seeding volume, seeding concentration and seeding condition is shown. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were seeded into cylindrically shaped 4 × 3 mm polymeric scaffolds, fabricated by fused deposition modelling. The initial <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> ranged from 5 × 104 to 8 × 105 cells, in volumes varying from 50 µl to 400 µl. To study the effect of seeding conditions, a dynamic system, {{by means of an}} agitation plate, was compared with static culture for both scaffolds placed in a well plate or in a confined agarose moulded well. Cell seeding efficiency decreased when seeded with high initial <b>cell</b> <b>numbers,</b> whereas 2 × 105 cells seemed to be an optimal initial <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> in the scaffolds used here. The influence of seeding volume was shown to be dependent on the initial <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> used. By optimizing seeding parameters for each specific culture system, a more efficient use of donor cells can be achieved...|$|R
