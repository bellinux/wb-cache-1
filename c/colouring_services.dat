50|$|Repeats from Pogles Wood {{continued}} until September 1973, when {{the series was}} retired, as BBC children's television finally moved fully over to a <b>colour</b> <b>service.</b> The umbrella series, Watch With Mother, continued (though with a change of name): but thereafter broadcast only those of its regular shows which {{had been made in}} colour.|$|R
50|$|The {{arrival of}} 625-line UHF & PAL colour {{television}} in the mid-1960s was not the rescue that domestic manufacturers had hoped. Test signals began in 1966 and scheduled transmissions commenced on BBC2 on 1 July 1967, with a full <b>colour</b> <b>service</b> beginning on that channel on 2 December 1967. BBC1 and ITV followed suit on 15 November 1969.|$|R

50|$|Thirty-Minute Theatre {{began on}} BBC2 in 1965 with an {{adaptation}} of the black comedy Parson's Pleasure (author, Roald Dahl). Dennis Potter contributed Emergency - Ward 9 (1966), which he partially recycled in the much later The Singing Detective (1986). In 1967 BBC2 launched the UK's first <b>colour</b> <b>service,</b> with the consequence that Thirty-Minute Theatre became the first drama series {{in the country to}} be shown in colour.|$|R

50|$|After the EMI board granted {{approval}} for the new camera, in late 1964, work on it progressed rapidly. The camera was to use four Plumbicon pick-up tubes, to use solid state circuitry, include a zoom lens as standard and to use prism optics. After the late start, the first fully operational prototype was shown to the BBC and others in 1966, only {{just in time to}} meet BBC time-scales for the introduction of their new <b>colour</b> <b>service.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{launch of}} the <b>colour</b> <b>service</b> led to a strike over Christmas 1971. A new film editor had signed a mutuality-binding three-month contract, and Grampian's {{decision}} to offer him permanent employment was not exercised. For the Christmas period, Grampian had hired colour studio cameras especially for the Hogmanay programmes and the filming of a networked documentary. The station resumed broadcasting at 10 pm on Boxing Day, which allowed the station to broadcast its first networked colour documentary Two Of A Kind.|$|R
25|$|However, {{much of the}} insert {{material}} was still in black and white, as initially {{only a part of}} the film coverage shot in and around London was on colour reversal film stock, and all regional and many international contributions were still in black and white. Colour facilities at Alexandra Palace were technically very limited for the next eighteen months, as it had only one RCA colour Quadruplex videotape machine and, eventually two Pye plumbicon colour telecines–although the news <b>colour</b> <b>service</b> started with just one.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the dawn}} of its {{commercial}} deployment from the 1950s through the 1990s, videotelephony also included [...] "image phones" [...] which would exchange still images between units every few seconds over conventional POTS-type telephone lines, {{essentially the same as}} slow scan TV systems. The development of advanced video codecs, more powerful CPUs, and high-bandwidth Internet telecommunication services in the late 1990s allowed videophones to provide high quality <b>colour</b> <b>service</b> between users almost anyplace in the world that the Internet is available, often at low or nominal costs.|$|R
50|$|Sales of the Type 2001 {{were very}} {{successful}} in the UK. The BBC {{and many of the}} independent TV companies installed the cameras in their studios during the rapid expansion of the UK <b>colour</b> <b>services</b> after 1967. However, by the time EMI had fulfilled its UK orders (towards the end of the decade), the boom in the US market had been missed and the European market had yet to fully develop or was already dominated by Philip's cameras. In addition, rival companies were already bringing out new designs and EMI now found only a limited market for a camera with a 4-tube configuration.|$|R

50|$|In 1967, BBC2 was {{the first}} UK {{television}} station to launch a full <b>colour</b> <b>service</b> on the UHF frequency band, and to mark the occasion a new symbol was launched. However, there is some confusion as to when the symbol was actually launched. Some colour programming was shown {{in the early part}} of the year, before the official date of 1 July 1967, but even the official launch date was only in the main regions. It was later that year on 2 December for the full country to receive colour transmissions, and because of these different dates, it is difficult to see when this ident was introduced.|$|R
50|$|Radio Rentals {{operated}} {{mainly in}} the UK, having started life in Boyces Street Brighton, Sussex, England. Growth of a public TV service after the war encouraged more people to want TV sets but they were expensive, leaving an opportunity for companies like RR to offer them at a monthly rental price which was much more affordable. With the coming of <b>colour</b> <b>services,</b> initially on BBC2 only, a further opportunity for renting was created. On 15 November 1969, colour broadcasts on both BBC channels and the ITV network became available from the main transmitter sites around the UK. This led to a boom in rental of the sets.|$|R

50|$|The {{use of the}} <b>service</b> <b>colours</b> of the Royal Navy {{were granted}} to the RCN in 1925. Two <b>service</b> <b>colours</b> were sent to Halifax and Esquimalt. In 1937 they were retired, and new colours sent. The {{official}} presentation of the king's colour was not completed until 1939. The Royal Canadian Navy's retired colours are laid up at Beechwood Cemetery in Ottawa, Ontario.|$|R
50|$|There are School <b>Colours</b> {{for both}} <b>Service</b> and Sport. Both {{are in the}} form of ties, with a design {{consisting}} of the standard MHS tie's stripes and a unicorn at the bottom for Half Colours; and the tie stripe alternating with unicorns for Full Colours. The Unicorns on Sport Colours ties are coloured gold; the ones on <b>Service</b> <b>Colours</b> are silver.|$|R

50|$|BBC2 625-line UHF <b>colour</b> {{television}} <b>services</b> came to Blaenplwyf in 1970 (early for Wales). VHF television {{continued as}} before. The service area for UHF however {{was designed to}} cover more of inland mid Wales than the VHF service had been.|$|R
5000|$|BBC One is a regionalised TV service which {{provides}} opt-outs {{throughout the day}} for local news and other local programming. These variations are more pronounced in the BBC [...] "Nations", i.e. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, where the presentation is mostly carried out locally on BBC One and Two, and where programme schedules can vary greatly {{from that of the}} network. BBC Two variations exist in the Nations; however, English regions today rarely have the option to opt out as regional programming now only exists on BBC One. BBC Two was also the first channel to be transmitted on 625 lines in 1964, then carry a small-scale regular <b>colour</b> <b>service</b> from 1967. BBC One would follow in November 1969.|$|R
50|$|Ulster Television's UHF PAL <b>colour</b> <b>service</b> was {{launched}} {{with the opening}} of the UHF transmitter Divis in September 1970. This was followed by two additional transmitters at Limavady (opened in 1975) and Brougher Mountain (in 1978). In the early 1980s it broadcast reduced hours when no schools programmes were being broadcast coming on air at 12 noon during the week, and closing down every evening at 23:30 - this remained in place until 1982. In October 1988, the station began 24-hour broadcasting - the last station in the ITV network to do so. UTV was originally scheduled to take a service provided by Central in Birmingham, but a late minute decision to switch to Granada Television's sustaining feed, Night Time, led to a month-long delay.|$|R
25|$|For the {{introduction}} of the first British <b>colour</b> broadcasting <b>service</b> in 1967 there was no new ident, but a new logo: a 2 with a dot inside the figure. There was originally a test period where the original presentation was used with possible electronic colour added. However, it was rejected and a new ident used. This ident was formed from the 3 light spots that come together to make the central dot. From there, a 2 is drawn around the dot. Once complete, the colour legend appears below before the 2 starts rotating slowly. The blue 2 rotates to reveal a red 2, green 2 and a white 2. The ident would continually spin after this. In 1969, when BBC1 launched its own <b>colour</b> <b>service,</b> the ident was updated to match BBC1's presentation. The 2 was now all white on a blue background, with the BBC2 logo underneath the 2. The clock that went alongside this look was originally a traditional clock face with Roman numerals before it was changed to a light blue clockface on a dark blue background with BBC2 legend below. This clock also had the 'polo' mint centre and was filmed on BBC2's NODD, black and white camera filming the clock with colour added later on.|$|R
