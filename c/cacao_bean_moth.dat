40|$|Background: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A. actinomycetemcomitans) is a Gram {{negative}} {{bacteria that}} form a subgingival plaque causing periodontitis. Nowadays, many natural resources {{can be used}} as a basic ingredient of drugs. One of the resources used as an antibacterial material is <b>cacao</b> <b>bean.</b> It contains of polyphenol flavonoids, such as catechin, epicatechin, anthocyanin, and proanthocyanidin. Chemical compounds contained in ethanol extract and water extract are different in quantity from those in cocoa beans. Purpose: This research aimed to find out difference in antibacterial activity between the 70 % ethanol and water extract of <b>cacao</b> <b>beans</b> (Theobroma <b>cacao</b> L.) on A. actinomycetemcomitans. Method: This research was an in vitro laboratory experiment. The serial dilutions was performed on the 70 % ethanol and water extract of <b>cacao</b> <b>beans</b> a concentration of 100 % to 3. 125 %. At each concentration, the 70 % ethanol and water extract of <b>cacao</b> <b>beans</b> were added with grown bacterial suspension of A. actinomycetemcomitans. After they were incubated for 24 hours, the bacteria grown on Luria Berthani media were observed. Bacteria colonies then were measured in CFU/ml. Result: There were significant differences in bacterial colonies grown at the concentrations of 6. 25 % and 3. 125 % between the 70 % ethanol extract of <b>cacao</b> <b>beans</b> and the water extract of <b>cacao</b> <b>beans</b> as p-value = 0. 000 (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: 70 % Ethanol beans and water extract of <b>cacao</b> <b>beans</b> have antibacterial activity against A. Actinomycetemcomitans.

40|$|Objective The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to assess the effect of <b>cacao</b> <b>bean</b> husk as bedding material in free-stall barn on the behavior, productivity, and udder health of dairy cattle, and on the ammonia concentrations in the barn. Methods Four different stall surfaces (no bedding, <b>cacao</b> <b>bean</b> husk, sawdust, and chopped wheat straw) were each continuously tested for a period of 1 week to determine their effects on nine lactating Holstein cows housed in the free-stall barn with rubber matting. The lying time and the milk yield were measured between d 4 and d 7. Blood samples for plasma cortisol concentration and teat swabs for bacterial counts were obtained prior to morning milking on d 7. The time-averaged gas-phase ammonia concentrations in the barn were measured between d 2 and d 7. Results The cows spent approximately 2 h more per day lying in the stalls when bedding was available than without bedding. The milk yield increased in the experimental periods when cows had access to bedding materials as compared to the period without bedding. The lying time was positively correlated with the milk yield. Bacterial counts on the teat ends recorded for cows housed on <b>cacao</b> <b>bean</b> husk were significantly lower than those recorded for cows housed without bedding. Ammonia concentration under <b>cacao</b> <b>bean</b> husk bedding decreased by 6 %, 15 %, and 21 % as compared to no bedding, sawdust, and chopped wheat straw, respectively. The cortisol concentration was lowest in the period when <b>cacao</b> <b>bean</b> husk bedding was used. We observed a positive correlation between the ammonia concentrations in the barn and the plasma cortisol concentrations. Conclusion <b>Cacao</b> <b>bean</b> husk is a potential alternative of conventional bedding material, such as sawdust or chopped wheat straw, with beneficial effects on udder health and ammonia concentrations in the barns...|$|R
