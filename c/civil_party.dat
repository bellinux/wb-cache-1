500|$|The dual-leadership {{system was}} {{reformed}} during Hu Jintao's term. In {{the aftermath of}} the Shanghai pension scandal, the central party leadership appointed the CDI leaders of the four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing) and suggested a preference for outsiders as CDI leaders in the provinces. Beginning in 2009, localities below the prefecture level began to abolish the practice of a control body in every party-controlled organisation. Before the reforms, every organisation (<b>civil,</b> <b>party</b> or government) with an embedded party committee or party group had a corresponding CDI-style department. The reforms consolidated control and supervision resources (including finances and personnel) {{under the auspices of the}} prefecture- or county-level CDI, which became an [...] "umbrella supervision organ" [...] of all party-controlled bodies in its area of jurisdiction and those below it. The umbrella organisation gave the CDI control of the staffing of party organisations it was tasked with overseeing, allowing more efficient use of CDI resources and reducing potential conflicts of interest arising from CDI staff involvement in the operations of a party committee it was supposed to regulate.|$|E
40|$|The {{experience}} of <b>civil</b> <b>parties</b> participating in Case 002 at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) provides important insights into victim {{participation in a}} mass atrocity trial. Understanding the expectations of <b>civil</b> <b>parties</b> and evaluating their experience so far will help us to improve victim support at future cases at the ECCC and other internationalised courts. This report presents the findings from interviews with <b>civil</b> <b>parties</b> {{at the beginning of}} Case 002 / 01. It uses a qualitative methodology grounded in thematic analysis and identifies key themes constructed and defined from the responses of <b>civil</b> <b>parties.</b> The report examines the following themes: what makes justice meaningful and satisfactory for civil parties; their goals for participating; the emotional consequences of application and participation; the impact of limited resources for victims; how <b>civil</b> <b>parties</b> understand the trial and participation process and their thoughts on moral and collective reparations. The report then draws some lessons learned, including the need for education concerning fair trial rights, calls for a strategy for communication regarding reparations and proposes different ways to maximise the impact of attendance. It also identifies a gap regarding psycho-social support at the application stage and calls for a general strategy for updates and support to <b>civil</b> <b>parties</b> despite the funding limitations. Finally, the report concludes with areas for future research...|$|R
40|$|With one exception, every Federal Rule of Evidence {{dealing with}} {{propensity}} character evidence or evidence {{which can be}} misused as propensity character evidence makes it either: (a) as difficult to admit such evidence in civil trials {{as it is in}} criminal trials, or (b) more difficult to admit such evidence in civil trials than it is in criminal trials. The 2 ̆ 2 mercy rule 2 ̆ 2 falls into this latter category as it allows criminal defendants to inject the issue of character into their trials while a similar luxury is not afforded to <b>civil</b> <b>parties.</b> Before 2006, however, a substantial minority of courts extended the 2 ̆ 2 mercy rule 2 ̆ 2 to <b>civil</b> <b>parties</b> in quasi-criminal cases because they were in most respects similar to criminal cases. Congress finally shut the door to this practice based upon the serious risks of prejudice, confusion, and delay that propensity character evidence engenders. These same risks, however, support treating <b>civil</b> <b>parties</b> in quasi-criminal cases the same as criminal defendants under the felony impeachment rule. That rule, Rule 609 (a) (1), makes it much more difficult for courts to exclude the felony convictions of <b>civil</b> <b>parties</b> than it is for them to exclude the felony convictions of testifying criminal defendants. It is thus the only Federal Rule of Evidence which makes it easier to admit evidence which can be misused as propensity character evidence in civil trials than it is in criminal trials. Courts should correct this anomaly by treating <b>civil</b> <b>parties</b> in quasi-criminal cases the same as criminal defendant under the Rule...|$|R
