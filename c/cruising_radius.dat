5|$|The Kaiserliche Marine {{designed}} the Bussard class in 1888 as an improved {{version of the}} Schwalbe class; like their predecessors, the Bussards were intended purely for colonial duty. They were larger and faster, with a comparable <b>cruising</b> <b>radius</b> and the same number and caliber of guns, though all but the first ship were equipped with new quick-firing models. The Bussard class was also the last cruiser design to incorporate a sailing rig in the German Navy.|$|E
5|$|On 6 January 1975, CINCPAC {{placed the}} 31st Marine Amphibious Unit on 96-hour alert {{to move the}} {{evacuation}} fleet into position off Kampong Som (previously Sihanoukville) in the Gulf of Thailand {{for the implementation of}} Operation Eagle Pull. On 6 February the reaction time was reduced to 48 hours, meaning that the evacuation fleet had to maintain a 48-hour <b>cruising</b> <b>radius</b> from Kampong Som. This was further reduced on 28 February to 24 hours, effectively meaning that the fleet had to remain within the Gulf of Thailand.|$|E
5|$|The Sachsen {{class of}} four ships {{was built in}} the late 1870s to early 1880s. The ships—, , , and —were {{designed}} to operate as part of an integrated coastal defense network. The ships were intended to sortie from fortified bases to break up an enemy blockade or landing attempt, and were labeled as Ausfallkorvetten (sortie corvettes) by the Imperial Navy. As a result of their intended roles, they were given a short <b>cruising</b> <b>radius</b> and were not intended for high-seas operations. Armed with six 26cm guns, they were, however, intended to fight hostile ironclads on relatively equal terms.|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{investigation was}} made of two supersonic interceptor type airplanes to determine the most desirable turbojet engine characteristics for this application The airplanes were designed differently {{primarily because of the}} amount of subsonic flight incorporated in the flight plan [...] one flight having none and the other, a <b>cruise</b> <b>radius</b> of 400 nautical miles. Several power plant design variables were varied independently to determine the effect of changes in each parameter on airplane performance. These parameters included compressor pressure ratio, compressor efficiency, turbine-inlet temperature, afterburner temperature, engine specific weight, and air-handling capacity. The effects of using a convergent-divergent exhaust nozzle and of changing the design flight Mach number were also investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{capercaillie}} (Tetrao urogallus L.) {{is a large}} ground-nesting grouse {{species with}} precocial chicks inhabiting in small isolated populations also Central-European mixed spruce-beech-fir and mountain spruce forests in the West Carpathians (KLAUS et al. 1986; SANIGA 1996 a,b,c). These forests underwent radical changes from natural re-gime to managed system especially {{in the course of}} the last century. Continuous multi-aged forests were transformed to a mosaic of even-aged stands. In recent years, greater attention was paid to the effects of forest habitat changes on faunal diversity and per-formance of wildlife populations (e. g. HELLE 1985; VÄISANEN et al. 1986; LINDÉN 1989; STORAAS et al. 1999). In terms of landscape ecology this large-scale change in forest mosaic is expected to have profound effects on the space pattern and range use of wildlife spe-cies, especially those having home ranges and <b>cruising</b> <b>radii</b> within the critical area interval (ROLSTAD, WEGGE 1989 a). Capercaillie belongs to this area-sensitive ca-tegory, inhabiting old forests throughout the year, and having seasonal ranges between 10 and 1, 000 hectares in size (WEGGE, LARSEN 1987). In the last few decades, capercaillie populations markedly declined throughout the most of Wester...|$|R
5|$|The {{ship was}} based on cruiser designs from late in World War I, {{primarily}} due to personnel shortages in the design staff and {{the closure of the}} Navy's experimental institute. Nevertheless, the ship incorporated major advances over the earlier designs, including large-scale use of welding in her construction and a significantly more efficient propulsion system that gave her a <b>cruising</b> <b>radius</b> fifty percent larger than that of the older ships. Emden was laid down at the Reichsmarinewerft in Wilhelmshaven on 8 December 1921 and launched on 7 January 1925. She was commissioned into the fleet nine months later, on 15 October 1925.|$|E
5|$|The {{third class}} of cruisers {{named after the}} capital of East Prussia marked a radical {{divergence}} from earlier cruiser designs. A new triple gun turret was adopted for the main battery, with one forward and two aft in a superfiring pair, offset from the centerline. And new, longer C/25 model guns were used. Major use of welding was also a feature of this class of cruisers, and diesel engines were used {{in combination with the}} turbines to increase their <b>cruising</b> <b>radius,</b> though only one set of engines could be run at one time.|$|E
25|$|In July 1917 the Oneida {{was ordered}} {{taken by the}} U.S. Navy for service during World War I, and the yacht was given the {{identification}} number SP-432. In September 1917 the orders were cancelled, and the Oneida continued to remain in Benedict's possession. Within the year the yacht was equipped with oil-burning boilers that increased her <b>cruising</b> <b>radius</b> to 4,000 miles. The yacht was reconstructed and overhauled in 1920, when its length was increased and state-of-the art equipment and luxurious fittings were installed.|$|E
25|$|The Commodore Perry, {{originally}} designed for short operating distances of the Great Lakes, was ill-fitted {{for her new}} duty in the open sea. Vessels on duty in Alaskan waters required ample food storage room, enough to hold six month's stores and provisions, and enough coal-bunker space to cruise actively {{for at least two}} weeks. The Perry was designed to carry only 90 tons. Making room for more coal required stores and provisions to be stored on the deck. Most often, her <b>cruising</b> <b>radius</b> was limited to about 1,500 miles, insufficient to meet the duties demanded of her.|$|E
