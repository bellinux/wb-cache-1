40|$|There {{is growing}} {{environmental}} {{concern with the}} methods of waste disposal used for handling hazardous materials in the metal finishing industry. A resulting need exists {{to develop and implement}} the best existing and potential technologies for waste minimization and resource recovery. The objectives of this study were to identify and briefly describe both existing and potential future methods for minimizing and recovering metallic wastes in the metal finishing industries. Included in the evaluation are {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the various methods available and under development. Existing minimization techniques include <b>countercurrent</b> <b>rinsing,</b> drag-out reduction, and waste segregation. Recovery methods investigated include evaporation, ion exchange, reverse osmosis, electrodialysis, and re-smelting of metallic wastes. Discussions on future methods also cover combination technologies with the trend toward development of closed-loop processes. Investigation has shown that additional research must be done to make the developing technologies economically feasible. These challenges are being met by increasing contributions from the technical community, particularly chemical engineers. Finally, the metal finishing industries must be willing to join in the developmen...|$|E
40|$|Proper {{design and}} {{operation}} of rinse systems following electroplating and other metal finishing operations are essential for adequate rinsing and economical use of water. Equations are given to define the primary rinsing factors. Conductivity measurements with auxiliary control of flow of the rinse water permit substantial savings in water consumption. <b>Countercurrent</b> <b>rinse</b> systems also permit additional substantial savings in water. Savings in water consumption with multiple rinse tanks are readily calculated by means of simple equations...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{operating}} a chromic acid plating process with controlled chemistry and, in turn, realizing consistent plating {{is now possible}} using an Electrodialytic Process that excels in pollution prevention. Chrome platers have problems. Their primary concern is to plate parts with a consistent coating- a coating without pits or bumps and of a uniform thickness. This is not easily done when the chemistry of the bath is continuously changing. Ideally the amount of electricity required to do the plating and the concentration and the chemistry of the bath remain constant. In reality, however, from the moment a brand new bath is used, everything changes- the energy required, the concentration of the acids and the coating itself. How rapidly the changes occur depends on items such as the ratio of anode to cathode, {{whether there is a}} reverse etch step, the number and variety of parts plated and what elements are dragged {{into and out of the}} bath. At some point in the plating process, the coating is not consistent or the amount of needed immersion time increases or the voltage has to be tumed up or catalysts have to be either added or removed. So the plater looks for ways to control the consistency of the bath. Often the plater removes a portion of the solution, stores it until it can be disposed of off-site (at increasingly higher costs) and replaces it with fresh make-up, or the plater relies on drag-out to remove the contaminants in the bath. At times the bath is analyzed and chemical adjustments are made based on the data reported. Another problem facing chrome platers is that employers and employees are concemed about safety in the workplace, particularly how to minimize chemical handling and potential contact with hazardous chemicals, and how to control emissions of fumes into the work environment. Because of these concerns, decanting chromic acid, storing barrels of hazardous waste and continual bath adjustments become less and less attractive ways to control bath chemistry. Other problems center around compliance, waste minimization, pollution prevention, cost of sludge disposal and waste treatment. Whenever possible, platers rinse parts over the tanks, use a stagnant dragout tank and <b>countercurrent</b> cascade <b>rinses</b> to minimize discharge and disposal of chemicals into rinse water and add as much rinse water as possible- with all the dragou...|$|R
