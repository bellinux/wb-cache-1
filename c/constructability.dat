50|$|Intuitionistic logic {{substitutes}} <b>constructability</b> for abstract {{truth and}} {{is associated with}} a transition from the proof of model theory to abstract truth in modern mathematics. The logical calculus preserves justification, rather than truth, across transformations yielding derived propositions. It has been taken as giving philosophical support to several schools of philosophy, most notably the Anti-realism of Michael Dummett. Thus, contrary to the first impression its name might convey, and as realized in specific approaches and disciplines (e.g. Fuzzy Sets and Systems), intuitionist mathematics is more rigorous than conventionally founded mathematics, where, ironically, the foundational elements which Intuitionism attempts to construct/refute/refound are taken as intuitively given.|$|E
50|$|Pre-construction {{services}} {{grew out}} of construction cost estimating to encompass the other activities in planning a project. The intent {{is to work with}} the project’s owner to help deliver a satisfactory project that meets the owner’s objectives. In addition to estimating, the preconstruction team participates in design decisions, evaluations, studies, value engineering, value analysis, scheduling, <b>constructability</b> reviews, and more. Design costs, permitting, land acquisition, and life-cycle costs may also be evaluated. In delivering pre-construction services, general contractors or construction managers may also be negotiating for project construction services. Often this may be accomplished by agreeing on a guaranteed maximum price (GMP) for the project. The firm then delivers the project. Typically the owner and the firm share any cost savings realized during construction.|$|E
5000|$|The tallest {{structures}} today (commonly called [...] "skyscrapers" [...] or high-rise) {{are constructed}} using structural steel due to its <b>constructability,</b> {{as well as its}} high strength-to-weight ratio. In comparison, concrete, while being less dense than steel, has a much lower strength-to-weight ratio. This is due to the much larger volume required for a structural concrete member to support the same load; steel, though denser, does not require as much material to carry a load. However, this advantage becomes insignificant for low-rise buildings, or those with several stories or less. Low-rise buildings distribute much smaller loads than high-rise structures, making concrete the economical choice. This is especially true for simple structures, such as parking garages, or any building that is a simple, rectilinear shape.|$|E
50|$|Most {{construction}} projects {{require the use}} of hundreds of different materials. These range from concrete of all different specifications, structural steel of different specifications, clay, mortar, ceramics, wood, etc. In terms of a load bearing structural frame, they will generally consist of structural steel, concrete, masonry, and/or wood, using a suitable combination of each to produce an efficient structure. Most commercial and industrial structures are primarily constructed using either structural steel or reinforced concrete. When designing a structure, an engineer must decide which, if not both, material is most suitable for the design. There are many factors considered when choosing a construction material. Cost is commonly the controlling element; however, other considerations such as weight, strength, <b>constructability,</b> availability, sustainability, and fire resistance will be taken into account before a final decision is made.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Constructability</b> - Reinforced {{concrete}} must be poured {{and left}} to set, or harden. After setting (typically 1-2 days), a concrete must cure, the process in which concrete experiences a chemical reaction between the cementitious particles and the water. The curing process is complete after 28 days; however, construction may continue after 1-2 weeks, depending {{on the nature of}} the structure. Concrete can be constructed into nearly any shape and size. Approximately half of the cost of using reinforced concrete in a structural project is attributed to the construction of the form-work. In order to save time, and therefore costs, structural concrete members may be pre-cast. This refers to a reinforced concrete beam, girder, or column being poured off site {{and left to}} cure. After the curing process, the concrete member may be delivered to the construction site and installed as soon as it is needed. Since the concrete member was cured off location beforehand, construction may continue immediately after erection.|$|E

50|$|Proponents of {{design-build}} {{counter that}} design-build saves {{time and money}} for the owner, while providing the opportunity to achieve innovation in the delivered facility. They note that value is added because design-build brings value engineering into the design process {{at the onset of}} a project. Design-build allows the contractor, engineers and specialty trade contractors (subcontractors) to propose best-value solutions for various construction elements before the design is complete. Design-build brings all members of a project team together early in the process to identify and address issues of cost, schedule and <b>constructability.</b> Proponents suggest that as a result, design-build alleviates conflict between architects and contractors and reduces owner risk for design errors. They argue that once design is finalized and construction begins, the greatest opportunity to achieve cost savings has already been lost, and the potential for design errors is greater, leading to change orders that create cost growth and schedule delays. Proponents note that design-build allows owners to avoid being placed directly between the architect/engineer and the contractor. Under design-bid-build, the owner takes on significant risks because of that position. Design-build places the responsibility for design errors and omissions on the design-builder, relieving the owner of major legal and managerial responsibilities. The burden for these costs and associated risks are transferred to the design-build team.|$|E

40|$|At {{the early}} design stage of {{construction}} projects, designers often rely on general rules of thumb to make critical decisions about the geometry, construction systems, and materials used in their designs without fully evaluating the applicable construction requirements and constraints. However, ease of construction, or <b>constructability,</b> is a critical factor that is best examined at the early {{stage of construction}} projects when designs are the most amenable to change. Currently, reviewing a design’s <b>constructability</b> requires that designers spend {{a significant amount of}} time manually extracting <b>constructability</b> data from building models. Data extraction for <b>constructability</b> presents a challenging task, especially in large and complex projects, in which designers may neglect important data pertinent to, or extract unnecessary data from, their designs. The absence of a quantitative <b>constructability</b> model in the United States and a schema for extracting the necessary data for an automated <b>constructability</b> assessment of building designs motivated this study to develop a building information modeling-based <b>constructability</b> assessment exchange model. Through a comprehensive review of the literature, seventy-nine <b>constructability</b> attributes were first identified, which were then categorized into six groups using factor analysis based on 298 responses received from a questionnaire-based survey of industry professionals. Then using pairwise comparisons between <b>constructability</b> factors and common building systems used in the United States, a <b>constructability</b> assessment model was developed with the knowledge obtained from construction experts. Next, this study created a <b>constructability</b> exchange model (EM) using the United States National Building Information Modeling Standard™ approach to automate the data extraction required for the <b>constructability</b> assessment. The proposed EM identifies a reusable and consistent data set (e. g., geometry, object structures, relations, and properties) required for <b>constructability</b> assessment of building designs. The <b>constructability</b> EM was validated through an experiment based approach to examine if the model would help designers explore the <b>constructability</b> of designs in less time, assess the <b>constructability</b> of designs more accurately, and formalize the method of <b>constructability</b> assessment. We also validated the <b>constructability</b> EM using the IfcDoc application, so software vendors can use the EM to examine if their importers and exporters comply with the terminology and rule sets it defines. Moreover, domain experts can use it to validate their models to ensure they have all the required information for assessing <b>constructability.</b> Using the proposed <b>constructability</b> assessment model, designers can identify the tradeoffs involved in the <b>constructability</b> of various design alternatives and make informed decisions about any proposed changes. The <b>constructability</b> EM provides formal classifications of construction information that, when implemented, automates the repeated and time-consuming task of <b>constructability</b> assessment of designs.

40|$|Selecting {{the most}} {{appropriate}} construction technology for a given project scenario {{is one of the}} most effective approaches for <b>constructability</b> improvement. Experienced construction engineers and managers are frequently involved in applying their <b>constructability</b> knowledge to technology selection during the early phase of a project 2 ̆ 7 s lifecycle in order to achieve cost effective construction. Due to natural attrition and other causes, the <b>constructability</b> knowledge of experienced personnel is diminishing in many construction firms. Moreover, because of the complex nature of construction operations, it is extremely difficult for construction experts to express their <b>constructability</b> knowledge while considering many variable attributes simultaneously. A methodology for automated <b>constructability</b> analysis and knowledge acquisition has yet to be developed. Without such a methodology, timely selection of {{the most appropriate}} construction technology and accumulation of knowledge for technology improvement will remain difficult. ^ This research is the first work on both quantifying the conventional descriptive definition of <b>constructability</b> and on exploring the learning ability of neuro-fuzzy networks for automatic <b>constructability</b> knowledge acquisition. The developed methodology differentiates itself from the traditional <b>constructability</b> analysis and improvement approaches in two aspects: 1) the quantitative definition of <b>constructability</b> is adopted instead of the traditional descriptive definition, so that <b>constructability</b> can be measured, estimated, and improved; (2) the self-learning techniques for <b>constructability</b> knowledge acquisition are adopted instead of the traditional manual human-input approaches, so that the automation of <b>constructability</b> knowledge acquisition and accumulation becomes possible. With this generic methodology, construction firms can develop their own decision support systems to analyze and solve specific <b>constructability</b> problems according to their specialized fields. The result of this research is a tool for continuous <b>constructability</b> improvement of construction projects and technologies. ^ A prototype computer implementation of the proposed methodology named COnstrUction techNology SELectOR (COUNSELOR) is developed for <b>constructability</b> analysis and improvement of concrete formwork technologies. The COUNSELOR system has demonstrated its abilities to quantify <b>constructability</b> according to the constructor 2 ̆ 7 s characteristics, detect potential <b>constructability</b> problems before the construction phase, and propose solutions for <b>constructability</b> improvement.

40|$|SUMMARY: The <b>constructability</b> {{appraisal}} methods developed so far {{are based}} on evaluating and analysing the major design components and systems of an entire building, such as structural systems, materials and production techniques. At first, this paper discusses the current practice of <b>constructability</b> assessment used in Finland and next it introduces an experimental <b>constructability</b> assessment method (ECAM) using building information models (BIM) {{as a source of}} <b>constructability</b> information. Interviews of design and construction professionals were used to explore the current practice of <b>constructability</b> assessment.

According to the interviews, the main assessment method used was the inspection of drawings, and <b>constructability</b> was assessed occasionally during the design development stage and more systematically {{at the very end of}} the detailed design stage with varying professional participants in meetings. Using ECAM in the project level a <b>constructability</b> score of a building and building type can be analysed.
