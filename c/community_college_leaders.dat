40|$|<b>Community</b> <b>colleges</b> {{across the}} country are working hard to help their {{students}} succeed. With increasing demands for accountability from the public and state governments, many colleges are feeling the pressure to make changes—now. Even more importantly, practitioners want their students to be successful so they can reap the benefits of their educational achievements: associate’s degree holders earn 33 % more than those with a high school diploma and bachelor’s degree holders earn 70 % more. Many colleges have been frustrated with the limited results stemming from past efforts to promote student success. With new approaches to improvement emerging and waning every few years, and expanding expectations contrasting with shrinking <b>college</b> budgets, many <b>leaders</b> and practitioners have become rightfully skeptical of the very idea of “change. ” Too often, <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> have begun to feel like enormous battle ships— no matter who is in charge and what changes are made, the ship is too big to move more than a degree or two from its original course.

Leaders are the products of their experiences, environments, the greater society within which they live, their personal attitudes and biases, and the attitudes and role biases of others. Over time, a corpus of multi- disciplinary research into the complex web of societal, professional-organizational, and institutional attitudes, expectations, and behaviors that impact career choice decisions and career advancement opportunities for leaders, and how leaders are evaluated, has waxed and waned. A review of theoretical literature and past research relevant for application in the <b>community</b> <b>college</b> context is provided. Literature exploring four distinct research areas was analyzed, with emphasis on the latter three : (1) leadership style; (2) the functions attitudes and attributions play in leader evaluations; (3) the relevance of role congruity expectations on evaluations of leaders; and (4) the variables directly influencing leader performance evaluation process outcomes.

" For some thirty years, Oregonians have looked to their 16 {{community}} colleges as the less expensive, more accessible route to a college education. Oregon's community colleges have traditionally had the broad mission of providing comprehensive educational opportunities to all adults who can profit from the instruction. This foundation of open access, however, has recently been challenged. Issues in Oregon's social, political, and economic environments the past few years have resulted in substantial financial pressure on the community colleges. This situation has prompted many Oregon <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>leaders</b> to make tough operational decisions. Rightsizing strategies encompassing all budget categories have been extensive across the state. In many cases, <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>leaders</b> have been able to manage decline successfully, maintaining the institution's broad mission. In other cases, however, leaders have selected strategies in direct conflict with the stated mission of open access. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the consistency between the rightsizing behavior of Oregon's <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>leaders</b> and the community college mission of open educational access. The study employed a Tylerian objective-oriented evaluation methodology as a theoretical framework.

Twenty-one leaders among three cases participated in the study, each completing the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) and participating in semi-structured interviews about how leaders use emotional intelligence to accomplish their work. Each case represents a single comprehensive community college in Washington or Oregon. Leaders included presidents, vice presidents, deans, and directors. The study addresses three research questions, including: How do <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>leaders</b> use emotional intelligence in their administrative duties? How does emotional intelligence shape organizational management and fulfillment of organizational objectives? What role does emotional intelligence have in leadership during challenging times? Findings identified several factors related to emotional intelligence and <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>leaders.</b> First, leaders often lacked knowledge of how they use emotional intelligence. Second, leaders with the highest emotional intelligence focused more on the teams {{and culture of the}} institution. Third, presidents were high in Strategic Area Ability on the MSCEIT instrument, suggesting presidents have a strong ability to understand and regulate emotions.

One in 7 high school students complete the GED with only 1 in 20 of those GED recipients becoming college students (About, 2012). Furthermore persistence and success rates for GED recipients who actually enter in post-secondary education are low (Strawn, 2007; Zafft, 2008; Rutschow and Crary-Ross, 2014; Zhang, 2010). Senior leaders are often {{in the best position to}} inspire motivation, direction, support for innovative programs and resources that promote persistence and success [...] for all students (specifically GED recipients) (Broadus and Martin, 2013; Garvey and Grobe, 2011).

40|$|The lack {{of student}} {{persistence}} is a burgeoning issue {{and over the}} last 40 years has become a national concern among researchers, administrators, policymakers and practitioners. Given the low persistence rates of first-year students at America?s <b>community</b> <b>colleges,</b> <b>leaders</b> are searching for useful and successful strategies that will aid in closing the gap in student attrition. Successful completion of a degree or certificate is often considered the great economic equalizer in today?s society from a public and cultural perspective. The purpose of this research study was to empirically investigate the odds ratio associated with predicting persistence that exists between first-time freshmen students who lived in campus housing and those who live off-campus at a large-city <b>community</b> <b>college</b> referred to as LCCC. Specifically, {{the focus of this}} study was to determine whether living in on-campus housing, receiving needs-based federal financial aid (Pell Grant), ethnicity, gender and enrolling in one or more developmental education courses are predictors of persistence. This study was predicated on the collection of quantitative data from a large-city <b>community</b> <b>college?s</b> student information system from the years 2010 through 2013. The researcher has concluded based on the data analysis of this research study the results were statistically insignificant for those students living on-campus when compared to those students living off-campus. An analysis of Ethnicity as a predictor of persistence revealed that in the short-term African-American students actually persisted at higher rates than their counterparts. However, in three of the last four semesters analyzed, African-Americans persisted at significantly lower rates than White students. Lastly, an analysis of the students who were enrolled in Developmental Education (Remedial) courses suggested that the odds are significantly lower concerning persistence versus their counterparts. However, it must be noted that both Hispanic students and those receiving needs-based financial aid (Pell) attrition was no worse than their counterparts. Based on the complex nature of both the <b>community</b> <b>college</b> student and the unique opportunity for them to live on-campus, additional data is required in order to measure and evaluate whether housing status promotes improved academic persistence.

This study describes and explains perspectives on shared governance among selected <b>community</b> <b>college</b> representative <b>leaders</b> at a Vanguard <b>community</b> <b>college.</b> Results indicate that <b>community</b> <b>college</b> governance coordination is not static and its success is based on historical and cultural influences. Colleges are socially constructed organizations influenced by current stakeholders building upon the foundation laid out by those before them. The social influences are both internal and external. Local and state funding decisions, accreditation requirements, legal decisions, social/cultural trends, economic demands, and leadership philosophies influence the governance of a <b>community</b> <b>college.</b> Many governance systems in colleges don't work because they address content (the knowledge, structure, and data in a college) or process (the activities and behaviors), but fail to address the context in which both of those elements reside. The determinant of people's action isn't what they know but how they perceive the world around them. How to appropriately involve classified staff, faculty, managers, and students in decision-making is a concern for college presidents and boards. However, if they ignore the role college constituents can play in creative development and problem solving, presidents and boards run the risk of missing out on the best solutions facing the college...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 231 - 238). Community colleges {{across the}} nation are facing a critical void in leadership {{during a time of}} unprecedented budget constraints due to the retirements of baby boomer presidents and vice presidents who started their careers in the 1960 s and 1970 s. Results from the Career and Lifestyles Survey indicated that 84 % of the community college presidents {{across the nation}} planned to retire by 2016. The leadership development options that currently exist to train future <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>leaders</b> include university-based educational programs (Ed. D. and Ph. D.), short-term conferences and workshops, and internal succession planning "grow your own" (GYO) programs. Succession planning programs known as GYO programs emerged in the early 2000 s as a strategy to recruit employees who are interested in career advancement into the leadership pipeline and prepare them for leadership positions. This study explores the results of a GYO succession planning program in recruiting and preparing employees for career advancement. A qualitative case study was conducted to gain an in-depth understanding of the GYO program participants' experiences in the program, the impact of the program on their career advancement behaviors, and the effectiveness of the program in filling the leadership pipeline. The American Association of Community Colleges Competencies for <b>Community</b> <b>College</b> <b>Leaders</b> and two of Malcolm Knowles' assumptions on andragogy were used as theoretical frameworks to guide investigation of the GYO program. This study is intended to inform <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>leaders,</b> those professionals who create leadership development programs, and aspiring leaders about the status of one GYO program...|$|E

To keep community colleges functioning in their critical role of providing wider {{access to higher education}} and workforce training and re-training, future leaders need to have the skills to lead complex organizations. To advance community colleges to a level of excellence, future <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>leaders</b> need to be prepared to be excellent leaders. This research project was designed to seek out the skills and abilities needed to be an effective community college leader and to investigate the level of preparedness of the mid-level leadership for career advancements. Using leadership competencies recommended by the AACC Project Leading Forward (2005) for <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>leaders,</b> mid-level leaders of community colleges identified as branch campus administrators of multi-campus community college systems had the opportunity to rank the competencies and assess their leadership competency attainment. The information from this national survey of branch campus administrators may aid individuals in their preparation for advanced leadership opportunities in community colleges. Organizations interested {{in the number of people}} in the leadership pipeline have additional information about the potential applicant pool numbers from this career pathway for available positions. College and universities that provide community college leadership through short-term or graduate programs may adjust the curriculum to provide leadership competencies key to these administrators and for their career aspirations. Preparation factors that made a significant difference in the preparedness were an earned doctorate and participation in formal leadership programs prior to their first branch campus administrator 2 ̆ 7 s position. The earned doctorate also made a significant difference in the self-assessed competency as a branch campus administrator. The AACC Leading Forward Project 2 ̆ 7 s Leadership Competencies were found to be appropriate for these mid-level leaders, and overall they had achieved an effective level of competency attainment. Some leadership competency areas that were identified for improvement included four communication skills and financial management and procurement skills and knowledge. Recommendations for <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>leaders</b> and leadership scholars based this study include: recruiting potential leaders for and marketing of formal leadership programs, encouraging and assisting potential leaders to complete doctorate degrees early in their careers, advocating and formulating career plans for intentional career moves, providing leadership experiences in addition to leadership knowledge for aspiring leaders, and creating an environment to encourage leadership development throughout the college 2 ̆ 7 s organization...|$|E

According to the American Association of Community Colleges, the ability to not only use data in {{decision making}} processes, but to understand best practices has become a competency that <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>leaders</b> must have or obtain in order to be considered a sufficient leader at this level of higher education. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the level of data literacy among <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>leaders.</b> Further, the study defines best practices for leaders who use data driven decision making within their current position. Specifically, the purpose of this research project is to address the data literacy level of leaders within the selected community colleges and provide the previously mentioned deliverables: • Descriptive statistics • Overview analysis of participating institutions • Suggestions and recommendations for participating institutions The American Association of Community College’s Leadership Competencies as well as Transformational Leadership Theory were used to guide the study. For this study, leaders are defined as anyone who may be in a faculty program director position or higher, executive level leaders which may include the president, vice president(s), chief financial officer, Deans including assistant or associate level. Leaders may also be established in other institutions as those that have administrative type duties along with a faculty or professional staff role Two hundred twenty <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>leaders</b> responded to the Data-Driven Decision Making Survey. The majority of the respondents showed a willingness to involve data in decision making and felt as if their institution was prepared to better use data in areas that they worked within. Most also felt as if they were prepared, personally, to better use data as a driver for better decision making at their institution...|$|E

Without a coherent and long-term approach to professional development, faculty will be unlikely to make the types of large-scale changes necessary to improve educational equity and student success. Despite twenty-five years of policy and recommendations regarding California <b>Community</b> <b>College</b> professional development, few colleges {{have been able to}} focus and sustain professional development efforts on improving educational equity and student success. While ???professional development,??? in some form, exists at most colleges, few colleges have been able to focus their professional development efforts on educational equity and student success. The purpose of this case study was to examine one of the few focused {{and sustained}} professional development programs in the California <b>Community</b> <b>College</b> system to identify strategies used by <b>college</b> <b>leaders</b> to shape and sustain the professional learning. Findings indicate that <b>college</b> <b>leaders,</b> distributed across the institution, used a number of strategies within three strategic frames - institutional integration, coalition building, and an expanding view of professional learning - to shape and sustain a faculty professional learning program focused on the evolving needs of faculty, the college, and students. <b>College</b> <b>leaders</b> addressed structural factors necessary for professional development, as well as organizational factors that support a culture of professional learning.

40|$|<b>Community</b> <b>college</b> advisors {{perform a}} crucial {{job in the}} student success mission. This study {{examined}} the competencies that <b>community</b> <b>college</b> advisors need {{to be successful in}} their jobs. The survey of <b>community</b> <b>college</b> advisors included a possible 942 respondents; 371 participated for a response rate of 39 %. Respondents rated the 48 job competencies for their priority and frequency of use. Using an expert panel, survey research, and exploratory factor analysis as the method of analysis, this study establishes a job competency model that <b>community</b> <b>college</b> advisors and <b>leaders</b> can utilize in recruitment and selection, job performance and evaluation, and professional development. The <b>community</b> <b>college</b> advisor competency model is a three-factor solution that summarizes and groups competencies into interpretable clusters. The competencies clusters for priority and frequency are: 1. 	student centered; 2. 	advisor centered; 3. 	institution centered. These distinct categories of competencies, when applied to complete advising duties, are likely to lead to achieving crucial outcomes, such as successful student completions. The three-factor solutions for priority and frequency were compared with the three competencies clusters as suggested by Boyatzis (2011) —cognitive intelligence, emotional intelligence, social intelligence. Each competency was found to require a blend of emotional, social, and cognitive intelligences. However, the student, advisor, and institution centered factors can be compared to social, emotional, and cognitive intelligences, respectively. In addition to a job competency model, this research offers highest rated priority and frequency of use competencies to consider in recruitment and selection and professional development. A job competency matrix is also provided for analyzing and improving advising practices in <b>community</b> <b>colleges.</b> All findings of this research are aimed at enhancing recruitment and professional development for the <b>community</b> <b>college</b> advisor...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore through their own stories and {{journeys}} (storjourns), how lesbian leaders influence and transform dominant <b>community</b> <b>college</b> culture. Five lesbian leaders participated who held the position of Director, Associate Dean, Dean, Executive Vice President, and President/Executive Dean. This microethnographical inquiry divulges and makes public the actions, pathways and tools that these lesbian <b>leaders</b> in <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> used to influence and transform their heteronormative <b>community</b> <b>college</b> cultures in ways of social, cultural, and educational justice and equity. Two research questions guided this inquiry: 1. In what ways do lesbian <b>leaders</b> of <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> influence the dominant heterosexual <b>community</b> <b>college</b> culture? 2. In what ways do lesbian <b>leaders</b> of <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> transform the dominant heterosexual <b>community</b> <b>college</b> culture? A critical microethnography research design was used in this qualitative study to focus on a group of lesbian <b>leaders</b> in <b>community</b> <b>college</b> with a shared culture who seek social justice from homonegative college cultures through reflection, action and change. Their storjourns reveal through their own voices the tools and pathways used to influence and transform <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> to be more socially, culturally, and educationally equitable for all who enter the doors and exact justice for all. Six evolutionary themes emerged from their storjourns: 1. Relationship Building and Coming Out in the Workplace 2. Safety 3. Mentorship 4. Policy and Power 5. Influencing <b>Community</b> <b>College</b> Culture 6. Transforming <b>Community</b> <b>College</b> Culture These <b>leaders</b> actions have proven to be successful throughout the progression of their careers as out lesbian leaders. The results of this study challenge lesbian <b>leaders</b> in <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> to realize and help establish a new and fully inclusive culture by moving beyond a passive or adaptive style of leadership. Their pathways and tools are made public through this study for all other lesbian leaders to follow and use. One intended outcome of this study is for lesbian leaders to become or remain out and promote the <b>community</b> <b>college</b> mission of open access by bringing their whole selves to the leadership experience each day to influence and transform <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> across the country...|$|R
