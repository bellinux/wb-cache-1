5|$|Published by Harcourt, Brace, and Company in December 1948, Theory of Literature {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from the academic community. It {{was used to}} teach literary theory beginning soon after publication and remained in common use into the 1960s. Its success has been credited as introducing European literary scholarship into the US and <b>crystallizing</b> a movement towards intrinsic literary criticism. Theory of Literature saw three editions and has been translated into more than twenty languages.|$|E
5|$|The {{orange and}} brown {{coloration}} {{in the clouds}} of Jupiter are caused by upwelling compounds that change color when {{they are exposed to}} ultraviolet light from the Sun. The exact makeup remains uncertain, but the substances are thought to be phosphorus, sulfur or possibly hydrocarbons. These colorful compounds, known as chromophores, mix with the warmer, lower deck of clouds. The zones are formed when rising convection cells form <b>crystallizing</b> ammonia that masks out these lower clouds from view.|$|E
5|$|Actinide salts {{can also}} be {{obtained}} by dissolving the corresponding hydroxides in acids. Nitrates, chlorides, sulfates and perchlorates of actinides are water-soluble. When <b>crystallizing</b> from aqueous solutions, these salts forming a hydrates, such as Th(NO3)4·6H2O, Th(SO4)2·9H2O and Pu2(SO4)3·7H2O. Salts of high-valence actinides easily hydrolyze. So, colorless sulfate, chloride, perchlorate and nitrate of thorium transform into basic salts with formulas Th(OH)2SO4 and Th(OH)3NO3. The solubility and insolubility of trivalent and tetravalent actinides is like that of lanthanide salts. So phosphates, fluorides, oxalates, iodates and carbonates of actinides are weakly soluble in water; they precipitate as hydrates, such as ThF4·3H2O and Th(CrO4)2·3H2O.|$|E

It is also called [...] "granulated honey" [...] or [...] "candied honey". Honey that has <b>crystallized</b> (or commercially purchased <b>crystallized)</b> can be returned to a liquid state by warming.|$|R

5|$|At ambient {{conditions}} bismuth shares the same layered structure as the metallic forms of arsenic and antimony, <b>crystallizing</b> in the rhombohedral lattice (Pearson symbol hR6, space group Rm No. 166), {{which is often}} classed into trigonal or hexagonal crystal systems. When compressed at room temperature, this Bi-I structure changes first to the monoclinic Bi-II at 2.55 GPa, then to the tetragonal Bi-III at 2.7 GPa, and finally to the body-centered cubic Bi-IV at 7.7 GPa. The corresponding transitions can be monitored via changes in electrical conductivity; they are rather reproducible and abrupt, and are therefore used for calibration of high-pressure equipment.|$|E
5|$|Magma {{sitting in}} an {{underground}} chamber for many years will start to see higher melting point constituents such as olivine <b>crystallizing</b> out. The effect {{is to increase the}} concentration of dissolved gases (mostly sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide) in the remaining liquid magma, making the subsequent eruption more violent. As gas-rich magma approaches the surface during an eruption, the huge drop in internal pressure caused by the reduction in weight of the overlying rock (which drops to zero at the surface) causes the gases to come out of solution, the volume of gas increasing explosively from nothing to perhaps many times that of the accompanying magma. Additionally, the removal of the higher melting point material will raise the concentration of felsic components such as silicates potentially making the magma more viscous, adding to the explosive nature of the eruption.|$|E
25|$|Acid salts of {{citric acid}} can be {{prepared}} by careful adjustment of the pH before <b>crystallizing</b> the compound. See, for example, sodium citrate.|$|E

50|$|In 1929, Northrop {{isolated}} and <b>crystallized</b> the gastric enzyme pepsin {{and determined that}} it was a protein. In 1938 he {{isolated and}} <b>crystallized</b> the first bacteriophage (a small virus that attacks bacteria), and determined {{that it was a}} nucleoprotein. Northrop also isolated and <b>crystallized</b> pepsinogen (the precursor to pepsin), trypsin, chymotrypsin, and carboxypeptidase.|$|R

25|$|While gem beryls are ordinarily {{found in}} pegmatites and certain {{metamorphic}} stones, red beryl occurs in topaz-bearing rhyolites. It is formed by <b>crystallizing</b> under low pressure and high temperature from a pneumatolytic phase along fractures or within near-surface miarolitic cavities of the rhyolite. Associated minerals include bixbyite, quartz, orthoclase, topaz, spessartine, pseudobrookite and hematite.|$|E
25|$|A major natural {{source of}} {{potassium}} nitrate was the deposits <b>crystallizing</b> from cave {{walls and the}} accumulations of bat guano in caves. Extraction is accomplished by immersing the guano in water for a day, filtering, and harvesting the crystals in the filtered water. Traditionally, guano was the source used in Laos for the manufacture of gunpowder for Bang Fai rockets.|$|E
50|$|Whether or not {{polymers}} can <b>crystallize</b> {{depends on}} their molecular structure - presence of straight chains with regularly spaced side groups facilitates crystallization. For example, crystallization occurs much easier in isotactic than in the atactic polypropylene form. Atactic polymers <b>crystallize</b> when the side groups are very small, as in polyvinyl and don't <b>crystallize</b> in case of large substituents like in rubber or silicones.|$|R
30|$|Hydration also {{occurred}} in the high-humidity period. Flatt (2002) and Steiger and Asmussen (2008) described the phase change of Na 2 SO 4. Under the experimental conditions (20 [*]°C), Na 2 SO 4 exists in two stable phases: anhydrate (thenardite) and decahydrate (mirabilite). At {{the beginning of the}} experiment, thenardite should <b>crystallize</b> on the rock surface because it directly <b>crystallizes</b> from a saturated solution above 32.4 [*]°C. At the beginning of the high-humidity period, salt deliquescence should cause a saturated solution to form. Because the saturated solution is supersaturated to mirabilite, mirabilite <b>crystallizes</b> from a salt solution (Flatt 2002). In fact, mirabilite <b>crystallized</b> in our experiment 30 [*]min after the first high-humidity period started. In the low-humidity period, mirabilite should <b>crystallize</b> from the solution at 95.6 %RH and dehydrate to thenardite below 76.4 %RH (Steiger and Asmussen 2008). The crystallization of thenardite is dominant below the equilibrium humidity of 86.6 %RH, although both mirabilite and thenardite <b>crystallize</b> directly from solution (Steiger and Asmussen 2008).|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{we sought}} to use the <b>crystallized</b> sand slag of blast furnace in the {{production}} of ordinary concrete. The natural sand is substitute totally or partially by the <b>crystallized</b> sand slag in the composition of concrete. The characterization of these concretes was made based on their mechanical properties: compressive strength, tensile strength as well as durability: capillary, absorption of water and shrinkage. The experimental results of concrete that is the natural sand is replaced partially or completely by <b>crystallized</b> sand slag were compared with experimental results of ordinary concrete. Results show that the percentages of <b>crystallized</b> sand slag on the composition of concrete have an important effect on the mechanical proprieties of concrete. The comparison of different characteristics of the study in this work shows the benefits of use of <b>crystallized</b> sand slag in the composition of concrete compared with ordinary concrete, which confirms the possibility to use the <b>crystallized</b> sand slag in the manufacturing of concrete...|$|R
25|$|Dobson interviewed {{serial killer}} Ted Bundy on-camera {{the day before}} Bundy's {{execution}} on January 24, 1989. The interview became controversial because Bundy was {{given an opportunity to}} attempt to explain his actions (the rape and murder of 30 young women). Bundy claimed in the interview (in a reversal of his previous stance) that violent pornography {{played a significant role in}} molding and <b>crystallizing</b> his fantasies. In May 1989, during an interview with John Tanner, a Republican Florida prosecutor, Dobson called for Bundy to be forgiven. The Bundy tapes gave Focus on the Family revenues of over $1 million, $600,000 of which it donated to anti-pornography groups and to anti-abortion groups.|$|E
25|$|Rachmaninoff {{had great}} command of {{counterpoint}} and fugal writing, {{thanks to his}} studies with Taneyev. The above-mentioned occurrence of the Dies Irae in the Second Symphony (1907) is but a small example of this. Very characteristic of his writing is chromatic counterpoint. This talent was paired with a confidence in writing in both large- and small-scale forms. The Third Piano Concerto especially shows a structural ingenuity, while each of the preludes grows from a tiny melodic or rhythmic fragment into a taut, powerfully evocative miniature, <b>crystallizing</b> a particular mood or sentiment while employing a complexity of texture, rhythmic flexibility and a pungent chromatic harmony.|$|E
25|$|After {{filtering}} {{any remaining}} solids, the clarified syrup is decolorized by filtration through activated carbon. Bone char or coal-based activated carbon is traditionally {{used in this}} role. Some remaining color-forming impurities adsorb to the carbon. The purified syrup is then concentrated to supersaturation and repeatedly crystallized in a vacuum, to produce white refined sugar. As in a sugar mill, the sugar crystals are separated from the molasses by centrifuging. Additional sugar is recovered by blending the remaining syrup with the washings from affination and again <b>crystallizing</b> to produce brown sugar. When no more sugar can be economically recovered, the final molasses still contains 2030 percent sucrose and 1525 percent glucose and fructose.|$|E
40|$|Past {{studies that}} have {{examined}} the relationship between Openness and <b>crystallized</b> ability have failed to account statistically for the fact that subtests commonly regarded as measures of <b>crystallized</b> intelligence (e. g., Vocabulary) are contaminated substantially by general intelligence. A method using residuals derived from a regression is proposed as a means to estimate <b>crystallized</b> ability. Further, self-reported intelligence was hypothesized to moderate or mediate the correlation between Openness and <b>crystallized</b> intelligence. It was found that two factors (General and Objective) could be derived from a principal components analysis (PCA) of the six Openness facets and that only Objective Openness correlated with intelligence. Using the residual approach to estimating <b>crystallized</b> ability, it was found that Objective Openness correlated with only g and not <b>crystallized</b> ability. The self-report intelligence measure correlated only with the General Openness factor. Based on {{the results of this study}} and a review of the empirical literature, it is argued that Openness should be correlated with g and that this correlation should exist based on theory. It is recommended that future research use the residual approach to estimating <b>crystallized</b> ability, and that a new emphasis on understanding the relationship between Openness and g is required...|$|R
40|$|Sample 77215 {{from the}} Apollo 17 Station 7 boulder is {{classified}} as a low-temperature, low-shock, non-regolith, impact ejecta breccia consisting mostly of norite lithic and mineral clasts. It is suggested that the norites in the sample <b>crystallized</b> and cooled relatively slowly at a depth greater than 8 km; orthopyroxene and anorthite <b>crystallized</b> contemporaneously, while the mesostasis {{was the last to}} <b>crystallize</b> after extensive differentiation and fractionation...|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of minerals and organic molecules <b>crystallize</b> easily, {{and the resulting}} crystals are generally of good quality, i.e. without visible defects. However, larger biochemical particles, like proteins, are often difficult to <b>crystallize.</b> The ease with which molecules will <b>crystallize</b> strongly depends on the intensity of either atomic forces (in the case of mineral substances), intermolecular forces (organic and biochemical substances) or intramolecular forces (biochemical substances).|$|R
25|$|Liquid {{particles}} are bound firmly but not rigidly. They {{are able to}} move around one another freely, resulting in a limited degree of particle mobility. As the temperature increases, the increased vibrations of the molecules causes distances between the molecules to increase. When a liquid reaches its boiling point, the cohesive forces that bind the molecules closely together break, and the liquid changes to its gaseous state (unless superheating occurs). If the temperature is decreased, the distances between the molecules become smaller. When the liquid reaches its freezing point the molecules will usually lock into a very specific order, called <b>crystallizing,</b> and the bonds between them become more rigid, changing the liquid into its solid state (unless supercooling occurs).|$|E
25|$|A common {{degradation}} {{issue in}} ceramics involves soluble salts. Soluble salts can either enter the clay {{body from the}} environment, for example from being buried underground for decades, or they are already naturally occurring due to {{the components of the}} materials or clay used. Non-archaeological objects, such as modern dishware, can acquire salts from normal use such as storing salt. Soluble salts respond to changes in humidity both high and low. In high humidity salts become soluble and in low humidity they crystallize. The changing from soluble to crystallization and back damages the surface of the ceramic because salt crystals are larger than liquid salt and therefore will shrink and expand the ceramic body. A white haze on the surface is the first indication of soluble salts, which is the salt <b>crystallizing.</b> Overtime the physical component of the body will crumble until it is completely destroyed.|$|E
25|$|In April 1432 at Sieradz, the Poles {{offered to}} Švitrigaila the same deal as Vytautas had during his reign: Švitrigaila {{would be the}} Grand Duke and Jogaila would be the Supreme Duke and after Švitrigaila's death Lithuanian throne would revert to one of Jogaila's sons. Švitrigaila ostensibly refused the offer <b>crystallizing</b> local resistance. On 31 August 1432, conspirators, {{including}} Semen Olshanski, Petras Mangirdaitis, Jonas Goštautas, attacked Švitrigaila and his escort at Ashmyany, where they were staying the night. Švitrigaila {{and some of his}} supporters, including Jurgis Gedgaudas and Jonas Manvydas, managed to escape to Polotsk while his pregnant wife was detained. The conspirators installed Sigismund Kęstutaitis, brother of Vytautas, as the new Grand Duke. It is unclear what groups supported Sigismund or why. Possibly some Lithuanian nobles were displeased with favors that Švitrigaila had granted to the Orthodox dukes, but prior to the coup no opposition had manifested itself. Sigismund, who had not {{played a major role in}} Lithuanian politics before the coup, and who had initially supported Švitrigaila, resumed the policy of union with Poland. On 15 October 1432 he signed the Union of Grodno, which in essence confirmed the Union of Vilnius and Radom (1401) and granted Sigismund the same rights as Vytautas had enjoyed during his reign. Following Sigismund's death, Lithuania was to return to the King of Poland. Sigismund also made territorial concessions to Poland in disputed Podolia and Volhynia.|$|E
2500|$|The {{melting point}} of <b>crystallized</b> honey is between , {{depending}} on its composition. Below this temperature, honey {{can be either}} in a metastable state, meaning {{that it will not}} <b>crystallize</b> until a seed crystal is added, or, more often, it is in a [...] "labile" [...] state, being saturated with enough sugars to <b>crystallize</b> spontaneously. The rate of crystallization is affected by many factors, but the primary factor is the ratio of the main sugars: fructose to glucose. Honeys that are supersaturated with a very high percentage of glucose, such as brassica honey, [...] <b>crystallize</b> almost immediately after harvesting, while honeys with a low percentage of glucose, such as chestnut or tupelo honey, do not <b>crystallize.</b> Some types of honey may produce very large but few crystals, while others produce many small crystals.|$|R
50|$|Some {{researchers}} have linked {{the theory of}} fluid and <b>crystallized</b> intelligence to Piaget's conception of operative intelligence and learning. Fluid ability and Piaget's operative intelligence both concern logical thinking and the eduction of relations. <b>Crystallized</b> ability and Piaget's treatment of everyday learning reflect the impress of experience. Like fluid ability's relation to <b>crystallized</b> intelligence, Piaget's operativity {{is considered to be}} prior to, and ultimately provides the foundation for, everyday learning.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  3 a {{corresponding}} to the slag sample with Al 2 O 3 content being 10  %, the mineralogical phases <b>crystallized</b> during cooling process were identical {{to those of the}} slag sample with Al 2 O 3 content being 13  % illustrated in Fig.  1 a. As Al 2 O 3 content was decreased from 13 to 10  %, the crystallization temperature of melilite and anorthite declined from 1387.2 and 1260.7 to 1379.5 and 1240.5  °C, respectively. When the temperature dropped to 1301.1  °C, calcium metasilicate started to <b>crystallize</b> from the slag system. At this temperature, the mass ratio of melilite <b>crystallized</b> reached to 66.57  %. As the temperature declined to 1240.5  °C, anorthite commenced to <b>crystallize,</b> and the mass ratios of melilite and calcium metasilicate <b>crystallized</b> have reached to 76.79 and 7.6  %, respectively. When the temperature declined to 1179.7  °C, the unstable compound named calcium metasilicate has transferred into wollastonite, which content was 7.6  %.

25|$|How {{the sample}} and matrix is {{deposited}} {{on the surface}} of the sample probe needs to be a consideration in sample preparation as well. The dried drop method is the simplest of deposition methods. The matrix and sample solution are mixed together and then a small drop of the mixture is placed on the sample probe surface and allowed to dry, thus <b>crystallizing.</b> The sandwich method involves depositing a layer of matrix onto the surface of the probe and allowing it to dry. A drop of the sample followed by a drop of additional matrix is then applied to the layer of dried matrix and allowed to dry as well. Variations on the sandwich technique involve depositing the matrix on the surface and then depositing the sample directly on top of the matrix. A particularly useful method involves depositing the matrix solution {{on the surface of}} the sample probe in a solvent that will evaporate very rapidly, thus forming a very thin fine layer of matrix. The sample solution is then placed on top of the matrix layer and allowed to evaporate slowly, thus integrating the sample into the top layer of matrix as the sample solution evaporates. An addition concern when depositing the sample {{on the surface of the}} probe is the solubility of the sample in the matrix. If the sample is insoluble in the matrix, additional methods must be employed. A method used in this case involves mechanical grinding and mixing of solid sample and solid matrix crystals. Once blended well, this powder can be deposited on the surface of the sample probe in free powder form or as a pill. Another possible method is placing the sample on the surface of the probe and applying vaporized matrix to the sample probe to allow the matrix to condense around the sample.|$|E
500|$|In 1928, Radclyffe Hall {{published}} a novel titled The Well of Loneliness. The novel's plot centers around Stephen Gordon, {{a woman who}} identifies herself as an invert after reading Krafft-Ebing's Psychopathia Sexualis, and lives within the homosexual subculture of Paris. The novel included a foreword by Havelock Ellis and {{was intended to be}} a call for tolerance for inverts by publicizing their disadvantages and accidents of being born inverted. Hall subscribed to Ellis and Krafft-Ebing's theories and rejected Freud's theory that same-sex attraction was caused by childhood trauma and was curable. The publicity Hall received was due to unintended consequences; the novel was tried for obscenity in London, a spectacularly scandalous event described as [...] "the <b>crystallizing</b> moment in the construction of a visible modern English lesbian subculture" [...] by professor Laura Doan.|$|E
500|$|The {{importance}} of antibodies {{in health care}} and the biotechnology industry demands knowledge of their structures at high resolution. This information is used for protein engineering, modifying the antigen binding affinity, and identifying an epitope, of a given antibody. X-ray crystallography is one commonly used method for determining antibody structures. However, <b>crystallizing</b> an antibody is often laborious and time-consuming. Computational approaches provide a cheaper and faster alternative to crystallography, but their results are more equivocal, since they do not produce empirical structures. Online web servers such as Web Antibody Modeling (WAM) [...] and Prediction of Immunoglobulin Structure (PIGS) [...] enables computational modeling of antibody variable regions. Rosetta Antibody is a novel antibody FV region structure prediction server, which incorporates sophisticated techniques to minimize CDR loops and optimize the relative orientation of the light and heavy chains, as well as homology models that predict successful docking of antibodies with their unique antigen.|$|E
