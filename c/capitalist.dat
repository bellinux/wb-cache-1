5|$|The CCP {{views the}} world as {{organized}} into two opposing camps; socialist and <b>capitalist.</b> They insist that socialism, {{on the basis of}} historical materialism, will eventually triumph over capitalism. In recent years, when the party has been asked to explain the <b>capitalist</b> globalization occurring, the party has returned to the writings of Karl Marx. Despite admitting that globalization developed through the <b>capitalist</b> system, the party's leaders and theorist argue that globalization is not intrinsically <b>capitalist.</b> The reason being that if globalization was purely <b>capitalist,</b> it would exclude an alternative socialist form of modernity. Globalization, as with the market economy, therefore does not have one specific class character (neither socialist nor <b>capitalist)</b> according to the party. The insistence that globalization is not fixed in nature comes from Deng's insistence that China can pursue socialist modernization by incorporating elements of capitalism. Because of this there is considerable optimism within the CCP that despite the current <b>capitalist</b> dominance of globalization, globalization can be turned into a vehicle supporting socialism.|$|E

Our main finding is that signifi- cant differences among the different types of venture <b>capitalists</b> exist. The behavior of independent and corporate venture <b>capitalists</b> is more similar to that of US funds whereas bank-dependent and public ven- ture <b>capitalists</b> typically are bridge investors rather than true venture <b>capitalists.</b> Our findings may be interesting for policy makers, for companies that seek capital and for venture <b>capitalists</b> who look for syndication partners.

Like many leftists at the time, he believed that fascism was a temporary, extreme expression of <b>capitalist</b> society that would soon be overcome by socialism. He nevertheless expressed admiration for the German archaeological establishment under the Nazi government, highlighting that the British state lagged far behind in terms of funding excavations and encouraging the study of archaeology in universities; he refrained from commenting on the political agenda that the Nazis had in promoting archaeology.|$|E

However, under both schemes, experienced venture <b>capitalists</b> save on management support. This paper shows that offering venture <b>capitalists</b> a choice between these two schemes can lead to a positive self-selection.

5|$|By the 1950s, Keynesian {{policies}} were adopted by {{almost the entire}} developed world and similar measures for a mixed economy were used by many developing nations. By then, Keynes's views on the economy had become mainstream in the world's universities. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the developed and emerging free <b>capitalist</b> economies enjoyed exceptionally high growth and low unemployment. Professor Gordon Fletcher has written that the 1950s and 1960s, when Keynes's influence was at its peak, appear in retrospect as a golden age of capitalism.|$|E
40|$|Cross-border {{venture capital}} {{investing}} {{has increased dramatically}} {{over the last two}} decades. Previous research has shown that foreign venture <b>capitalists</b> tend to partner with local venture <b>capitalists</b> as a strategy for offsetting information asymmetries and liabilities of foreignness. This paper examines the choice of co-investors by foreign venture <b>capitalists</b> investing in the Chinese market. We find that foreign investors are more likely to choose Chinese investors in later investment rounds and in more mature portfolio firms. More experienced foreign venture capital firms are less likely to co-invest with Chinese venture <b>capitalists.</b> Also, having a Chinese office made foreign venture <b>capitalists</b> less likely to co-invest. In seed-stage investments, when risks are the greatest, foreign firms are least likely to co-invest with Chinese venture <b>capitalists,</b> while at the later stage, when risks are presumably the lowest is when they are most likely to co-invest. During this period, the propensity to co-invest with Chinese venture <b>capitalists</b> increased significantly in every stage except the seed stage. ...|$|R

The relationship between Chiang Kai-shek and Chinese <b>capitalists</b> remained poor throughout the period of his administration. Chiang blocked Chinese <b>capitalists</b> from gaining any political power or voice within his regime. Once Chiang Kai-shek was done with his White Terror on pro-communist laborers, he proceeded to turn on the <b>capitalists.</b> Gangster connections allowed Chiang to attack them in the International Settlement, successfully forcing <b>capitalists</b> to back him up with their assets for his military expeditions.|$|R

Marx himself never simply equated <b>capitalists</b> with their character masks; they were human beings entangled in a certain life predicament, like anybody else. <b>Capitalists</b> became the [...] "personification" [...] of their capital, because they had money which was permanently invested somewhere, and which necessarily had to obtain a certain yield.

5|$|In a {{twist on}} The Mansion of Happiness, McLoughlin Brothers and Parker Brothers {{released}} several {{games in the}} late 1880s based on the then-popular Algeresque rags to riches theme. Games such as Game of the District Messenger Boy, or Merit Rewarded, Messenger Boy, Game of the Telegraph Boy, and The Office Boy allowed players to emulate the successful <b>capitalist.</b> Players began these games as company underlings, newbies, or gofers, and, with luck, won {{the game with a}} seat in the President's Office (rather than a seat in Heaven, as in The Mansion of Happiness) or as Head of the Firm. In Parker Brothers' The Office Boy, spaces designating carelessness, inattentiveness, and dishonesty sent the player back on the track while spaces designating capability, earnestness, and honesty advanced him toward the goal. Such games reflected the belief that the enterprising American– regardless of his background, humble or privileged– would be rewarded under the American <b>capitalist</b> system, and insinuated that success was equated with increased social status via the accumulation of wealth.|$|E

Bygrave and Timmons discussed the function of venture <b>capitalists</b> that revolves around the growth stages, and stated that venture <b>capitalists</b> that invest in early stage ventures must have, in addition to the astute ability to select promising portfolio firms, the ability to support and add value to the portfolio firms after investment. With respect to venture <b>capitalists</b> that invest in new technology based firms, Pfirrmann et al identified 3 types of risk; i. e. business risk, innovation risks and financial risks. Baum and Silverman maintain that venture <b>capitalists</b> investing in new technology based firms are likely to consistently combine both scouting for excellent technology as well as being able to coach by imparting management skills. With the rise of the developing nations, and the escalation of global economic competition, the commercialization and industrialization of new technologies such as biotechnology and nanotechnology is promising for the revitalization of the economies of Japan and other industrialized nations. The creation of ventures based on these new technologies is one of the important options for commercialization and industrialization, and it is desirable that during this creation process, venture <b>capitalists</b> not simply parasite high-tech entrepreneurs, but instead provide value to them and exercise originality...|$|R
