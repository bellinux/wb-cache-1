40|$|Until now, {{liquid crystal}} display (LCD) {{monitors}} have not been used widely for research in vision. Despite their main advantages of continuous illumination and low electromagnetic emission, these monitors had problems with timing and reliability. Here we report that {{there is at least}} one new inexpensive 120 [*]Hz model, whose timing and stability is on a par with a benchmark <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>tube</b> <b>monitor,</b> or even better. The onset time was stable across repetitions, 95 % confidence interval (the error) of which was < 0. 01 [*]ms. Brightness was also delivered reliably across repeated presentations (< 0. 04 % error) and across blocks with different durations (< 3 % error). The LCD monitor seems suitable for many applications in vision research, including the studies that require combined accuracy of timing and intensity of visual stimulation...|$|E
40|$|Glass with {{different}} chemical compositions, deriving from separate collection, {{has been used}} as fine aggregate to formulate cementitious mortars, substituting natural sand. Glass coming from <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>tube</b> <b>monitors,</b> fluorescent lamps, and crystal glass (from production of home décor items) along with glass deriving from soda-lime glass containers, which has been taken as a reference, have been investigated. Glass solubility has been determined in alkaline environment similar to the one inside the cementitious composites. Alkali silica reaction has been tested on glass modified cement mortar in different accelerated conditions. The obtained results highlight an expansion behaviour of mortar samples containing glass with chemical composition different with respect to soda-lime glass. This behaviour is largely dependent on the ratio among modifier and stabilizer oxides in the glass and affects its solubility and consequently the gels composition when alkali silica reactions take place...|$|R
50|$|Currently, the macroelectronics {{industry}} is dramatically {{growing in the}} similar way as the microelectronics was in early ’90s. The most visible example of macroelectronics at present is flat-panel displays, which have been rapidly replacing <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> as the <b>monitors</b> of choice for computers and televisions since 2000. The flat-panel displays have enabled applications unimaginable for <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>tubes.</b> For example, the Dolphins Stadium in Miami will soon have the world's largest high definition video display, about 15 m high and 42 m wide, comprising more than 4.6 million light-emitting diodes, showing image of more than 1.5 million pixels.|$|R
50|$|As an {{exploration}} game, the player can move Green around the current level, {{but has no}} direct means to interact with it. Several non-playable characters can be approached to initiate a one-side dialog with them. Through each level are several <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>tube</b> <b>monitors</b> that once discovered will present a Roman numeral value to the player. This represents the number of reality-warping points that must {{be found in the}} nearby area. These points are marked with a glowing Θ (Theta) glyph, but may require the player to look upon the point from a specific vantage point, to turn to look at the point from a specific direction, or to look near the point to eliminate objects in front of it to make it appear. When the glyph is hidden, objects nearby will flicker in and out of reality, allowing the player to recognize the glyph is nearby. Once the glyph is found, the player interacts with their controllers to activate it. This causes a spherical bubble of a new reality to replace what had previously been there. Once all the glyphs for a section are found, the player is given some narrative for the game, and other sections of the level may be made available. Once all sections are completed in the same manner, the player must then find the right vantage point on the level to active a final large glyph that spans across many difference surfaces.|$|R

According to the American Dental Association, in 1994 66. 8 % of dentists in the United States were already using them in their practices. 1 Although accounting tasks remain a primary function, clinical applications such as diagnosis, treatment planning and monitoring of treatment are becoming available with advances in computer technology.

40|$|Electronic {{equipment}} can emit unintentional {{signals from}} which eavesdroppers may reconstruct processed data at some distance. This {{has been a}} concern for military hardware for over half a century. The civilian computer-security community {{became aware of the}} risk through the work of van Eck in 1985. Military "Tempest" shielding test standards remain secret and no civilian equivalents are available at present. The topic is still largely neglected in security textbooks {{due to a lack of}} published experimental data. This report documents eavesdropping experiments on contemporary computer displays. It discusses the nature and properties of compromising emanations for both <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>tube</b> and liquid-crystal <b>monitors.</b> The detection equipment used matches the capabilities to be expected from well-funded professional eavesdroppers. All experiments were carried out in a normal unshielded office environment. They therefore focus on emanations from display refresh signals, where periodic averaging can be used to obtain reproducible results in spite of varying environmental noise. Additional experiments described in this report demonstrate how to make information emitted via the video signal more easily receivable, how to recover plaintext from emanations via radio-character recognition, how to estimate remotely precise video-timing parameters, and how to protect displayed text from radio-frequency eavesdroppers by using specialized screen drivers with a carefully selected video card. Furthermore, a proposal for a civilian radio-frequency emission-security standard is outlined, based on path-loss estimates and published data about radio noise levels. Finally, a new optical eavesdropping technique is demonstrated that reads CRT displays at a distance. It observes high-frequency variations of the light emitted, even after diffuse reflection. Experiments with a typical monitor show that enough video signal remains in the light to permit the reconstruction of readable text from signals detected with a fast photosensor. Shot-noise calculations provide an upper bound for this risk...|$|R
