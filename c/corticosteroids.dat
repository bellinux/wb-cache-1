5|$|During {{symptomatic}} attacks, {{administration of}} {{high doses of}} intravenous <b>corticosteroids,</b> such as methylprednisolone, is the usual therapy, with oral <b>corticosteroids</b> seeming to have a similar efficacy and safety profile. Although, in general, effective {{in the short term}} for relieving symptoms, corticosteroid treatments do not appear to {{have a significant impact on}} long-term recovery. The consequences of severe attacks that do not respond to <b>corticosteroids</b> might be treatable by plasmapheresis.|$|E
5|$|Certain medications, such as <b>corticosteroids</b> and {{infliximab}} (an anti-αTNF monoclonal antibody), {{are becoming}} increasingly important risk factors, especially in the developed world.|$|E
5|$|<b>Corticosteroids</b> {{have also}} been {{investigated}} {{for the prevention of}} PTE, but clinical trials revealed that the drugs did not reduce late PTS and were actually linked to {{an increase in the number}} of early PTS.|$|E

5|$|In chronic {{inflammatory}} {{diseases like}} atopic dermatitis (skin), rheumatoid arthritis (joints),…, {{the side effects}} of <b>corticosteroids</b> are problematic because of the necessary long-term treatment. Therefore, SEGRAMs are being investigated as an alternative topical treatment. Systemic long-term treatment of inflammations with <b>corticosteroids</b> is particularly liable to cause metabolic side-effects, which makes the development of oral SEGRAMs an interesting goal. It {{remains to be seen whether}} selective receptor agonists or modulators indeed cause significantly less side-effects than classical corticoids in clinical applications.|$|E
5|$|Drug-induced {{psoriasis}} {{may occur}} with beta blockers, lithium, antimalarial medications, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, terbinafine, calcium channel blockers, captopril, glyburide, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukins, interferons, lipid-lowering drugs, and paradoxically TNF inhibitors such as infliximab or adalimumab. Withdrawal of <b>corticosteroids</b> (topical steroid cream) can aggravate psoriasis {{due to the}} rebound effect.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{measures}} can include rest, caffeine intake (via coffee or intravenous infusion), and hydration. <b>Corticosteroids</b> may provide transient relief for some patients. An abdominal binder — {{a type of}} garment that increases intracranial pressure by compressing the abdomen — can temporarily relieve symptoms for some people.|$|E

5|$|Some older {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that statin therapy might reduce vasospasm, but a subsequent meta-analysis including further trials did not demonstrate benefit on either vasospasm or outcomes. While <b>corticosteroids</b> with mineralocorticoid activity may help prevent vasospasm their use does not appear to change outcomes.|$|E
5|$|The {{first line}} therapy for aphthous {{stomatitis}} is topical agents rather than systemic medication, with topical <b>corticosteroids</b> being the mainstay treatment. Systemic treatment is {{usually reserved for}} severe disease due {{to the risk of}} adverse side effects associated with many of these agents. A systematic review found that no single systemic intervention was found to be effective. Good oral hygiene is important to prevent secondary infection of the ulcers.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic <b>corticosteroids</b> (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold. Also, bupropion {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E

5|$|Laubenstein {{developed}} appendicitis in 1984 and {{was afraid}} to undergo surgery {{because of the risk}} that general anesthesia would pose to her lungs, already compromised from polio. After the operation, her surgeons had trouble weaning her off the ventilator and she suffered a psychotic breakdown requiring admission to a psychiatric hospital; the psychiatrists theorized that her hallucinations were caused by hypoxia from the anesthesia. In 1990, she fell ill with a combination of asthma, gastroenteritis and respiratory failure, though she continued to work. She started taking <b>corticosteroids</b> for her respiratory problems—which were exacerbated by allergies to her two pet cats—and was unable to wean herself off them despite experiencing side effects.|$|E
5|$|Myxedema coma {{or severe}} decompensated {{hypothyroidism}} usually requires {{admission to the}} intensive care, close observation and treatment of abnormalities in breathing, temperature control, blood pressure, and sodium levels. Mechanical ventilation may be required, as well as fluid replacement, vasopressor agents, careful rewarming, and <b>corticosteroids</b> (for possible adrenal insufficiency which can occur together with hypothyroidism). Careful correction of low sodium levels may be achieved with hypertonic saline solutions or vasopressin receptor antagonists. For rapid treatment of the hypothyroidism, levothyroxine or liothyronine may be administered intravenously, particularly if the level of consciousness is too low {{to be able to}} safely swallow medication.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal tubes {{can be used}} {{to ensure}} the {{adequate}} exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, to deliver oxygen in higher concentrations than found in air, or to administer other gases such as helium, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide, xenon, or certain volatile anesthetic agents such as desflurane, isoflurane, or sevoflurane. They may also be used as a route for administration of certain medications such as bronchodilators, inhaled <b>corticosteroids,</b> and drugs used in treating cardiac arrest such as atropine, epinephrine, lidocaine and vasopressin.|$|E

5|$|Aspirin {{is known}} to {{interact}} with other drugs. For example, acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs. Aspirin {{is known to}} displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, warfarin, methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, {{an important part of}} valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. <b>Corticosteroids</b> may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. Ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin, and it is known to compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.|$|E
5|$|Asthma, chronic bronchitis, {{bronchiectasis}} {{and chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are all obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction. This limits {{the amount of}} air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. Obstructive lung diseases are often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with pulmonary function tests such as spirometry. Many obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding triggers (such as dust mites or smoking), with symptom control such as bronchodilators, and with suppression of inflammation (such as through <b>corticosteroids)</b> in severe cases. One common cause of COPD and emphysema is smoking, and common causes of bronchiectasis include severe infections and cystic fibrosis. The definitive cause of asthma is not yet known.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} {{is needed in}} a case of a severe allergic reaction. Before calling for help, laying a person down and elevating the legs is suggested. Depending on a patients needs, they will be given an EpiPen or an Anapen to use in case they are stung. In a scenario of experiencing anaphylaxis, further doses of adrenaline and intravenous infusions may be required. Some with severe anaphylaxis may suffer cardiac arrest and will need resuscitation. Inhalers may additionally be used in case a victim has asthma and experiences a reaction from a sting. The use of ACE inhibitors is not recommended, as it is known to increase the risk of anaphylaxis. Medications like antihistamines, H2 blockers, <b>corticosteroids</b> and anti-leukotrienes have no effect on anaphylaxis.|$|E

50|$|If relapse occurs after <b>corticosteroid</b> {{treatment}} or <b>corticosteroid</b> treatment is not tolerated, immunomodulators may be used. Immunomodulators such as azathioprine, and 6-mercaptopurine {{have been shown}} to extend remission of autoimmune pancreatitis after <b>corticosteroid</b> treatment. If <b>corticosteroid</b> and immunomodulator treatments are not sufficient, rituximab may also be used. Rituximab has been shown to induce and maintain remission.|$|R
5|$|Infection, {{bacterial}} or viral, {{particularly from}} Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococcus and Pseudomonas spp. Reports at the 16th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in 2006 indicated that bacterial infections are seldom serious, but that ten to {{twenty percent of}} piercings result in local benign bacterial infection. The Mayo Clinic estimates 30%. Risk of infection is greatest among those with congenital heart disease, who have a much higher chance of developing life-threatening infective endocarditis, hemophiliacs and diabetics, {{as well as those}} taking <b>corticosteroids.</b> In 2006, a diabetic woman in Indiana lost a breast due to an infection from a nipple piercing. Viral infections may include hepatitis B, hepatitis C and, potentially, HIV, although as of 2009 there had been no documented cases of HIV caused by piercing. While rare, infection due to piercing of the tongue can be fatal. Higher prevalence of colonization of Candida albicans was reported in young individuals with tongue piercing, in comparison to non-tongue-pierced matched individuals.|$|E
5|$|Pain: {{acute pain}} is mainly due to optic {{neuritis}} (with <b>corticosteroids</b> {{being the best}} treatment available), as well as trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte's sign, or dysesthesias. Subacute pain is usually secondary to the disease and can be a consequence of spending too long in the same position, urinary retention, and infected skin ulcers, amongst others. Treatment will depend on cause. Chronic pain is very common and harder to treat as its most common cause is dysesthesias. Acute pain due to trigeminal neuralgia is usually successfully treated with anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine or phenytoin. Both Lhermitte's sign and painful dysesthesias usually respond to treatment with carbamazepine, clonazepam, or amitriptyline. Sativex is approved for treatment of pain in MS in different countries, but due to its derivation from cannabis, it is currently not available in others, such as the USA. This medication is also being investigated {{for the management of}} other MS symptoms, such as spasticity, and has shown long-term safety and efficacy.|$|E
5|$|The full {{profile of}} amphetamine's {{short-term}} drug effects in humans is mostly derived through increased cellular communication or neurotransmission of dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, histamine, CART peptides, endogenous opioids,C]carfentanil binding in several {{regions of the}} human brain, including the basal ganglia, frontal cortex, and thalamus (Colasanti et al. 2012). Oral administration of d-amphetamine, 0.5mg/kg, 3h before carfentanil injection, reduced BPND values by 2–10%. The results were confirmed in another group of subjects (Mick et al. 2014). However, Guterstam and colleagues observed no change in carfentanil binding when d-amphetamine, 0.3mg/kg, was administered intravenously directly before injection of carfentanil (Guterstam et al. 2013). It has been hypothesized that this discrepancy {{may be related to}} delayed increases in extracellular opioid peptide concentrations following amphetamine-evoked monoamine release (Colasanti et al. 2012; Mick et al. 2014).}} adrenocorticotropic hormone, <b>corticosteroids,</b> and glutamate, which it effects through interactions with , , , , , , and possibly other biological targets.|$|E
40|$|The diurnal {{rhythm of}} <b>corticosteroid</b> {{secretion}} {{is controlled by}} the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). In rats, plasma <b>corticosteroid</b> levels rise just before the onset of the activity period during the dark phase. Our previous results indicated that vasopressin as a neurotransmitter from the SCN inhibited <b>corticosteroid</b> secretion {{in the area of the}} paraventricular/dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. We hypothesized that during the day the SCN may serve as an inhibitory system for <b>corticosteroid</b> secretion. To investigate this possibility, intact and SCN-lesioned animals were exposed to mild stress in the morning and evening and their plasma <b>corticosteroid</b> levels were monitored. The results indicate that SCN-lesioned animals have higher morning <b>corticosteroid</b> levels and respond both in the morning and evening with higher <b>corticosteroid</b> levels after stress than do intact control animals. We conclude, therefore, that these results indicate an inhibitory role of the SCN on <b>corticosteroid</b> secretion. The apparent discrepancy with the reported stimulatory role of the SCN on adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion is discusse...|$|R

40|$|The current {{guidelines}} recommend 21 -day adjunctive <b>corticosteroid</b> {{therapy for}} HIV- 1 -infected pneumocystis pneumonia patients (HIV-PCP) with moderate-to-severe disease. Whether shorter adjunctive <b>corticosteroid</b> therapy is feasible in such patients is unknown. We conducted a retrospective study to elucidate {{the proportion of}} patients with moderate and severe HIV-PCP who required adjunctive <b>corticosteroid</b> therapy for 21 days. The enrollment criteria included HIV-PCP that fulfilled the current criteria for 21 -day <b>corticosteroid</b> therapy; PaO 2 on room air of 14 days, whereas 35 % of the patients with severe HIV-PCP (n = 51, A-aDO 2 ≥ 45 mmHg) required <b>corticosteroid</b> therapy for ≥ 21 days. Four (13 %) of the severe cases died, whereas no patient with moderate disease died. Among patients with severe HIV-PCP, discontinuation of <b>corticosteroid</b> therapy within 14 days correlated significantly with higher baseline CD 4 (p = 0. 049). Shorter adjunctive <b>corticosteroid</b> therapy was clinically effective and adjunctive <b>corticosteroid</b> could be discontinued within 14 days in 60 % of moderate-to-severe HIV-PCP and 90 % of moderate cases...|$|R
