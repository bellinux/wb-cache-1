40|$|The {{knowledge}} of radar backscatter characteristics of high-voltage power lines {{is of great}} importance {{in the development of}} a millimeter-wave wire detection system. In this paper, a very high-frequency technique based on an iterative physical optics approach is developed for predicting polarimetric radar backscattering behavior of power lines of arbitrary strand arrangement. In the proposed scattering model the induced surface current is obtained using the tangent plane approximation in an iterative manner where the first-order current, obtained from the incident wave, is used as the source for the second-order current and so on. The approximation is valid for frequencies where the <b>cable</b> <b>strand</b> diameter is on the order of or larger than the wavelength. It is shown that the copolarized backscatter is dominated by the contribution from the first-order PO currents, whereas the cross-polarized backscatter is generated by the second- and higher order PO currents. Using this model, the effects of radar antenna footprint, surface irregularities, and cable sag (when suspended between towers) on radar backscatter are studied. To verify the validity of the proposed model, theoretical results are compared at 94 GHz with experimental results and are found to be in good agreement...|$|E

40|$|Sixteen single shear {{tests were}} carried out on eight {{geometric}} cable variations provided for testing from Australian suppliers – Jennmar, Megabolt and Minova. Each test was subjected to varying pre-tension values of zero and 15 tonnes, exploring the effect of plain, spiral, bulbed, indented and a combination of plain and indented wire strands. The results obtained demonstrated that the shear strength of plain strand cable was higher than the spiral and/or indented profiled cables with direct correlation to the strands ultimate tensile strength. All the plain profiled cables experienced an element of partial debonding suggesting that their application at embedment length less than 1. 8 m each anchor side may not be adequate. The spiral and indented profile strands provided greater bond strength at the cable-grout interface due to the surface roughness of the wires imposing an interlocking effect, leading to reduced shear displacement. The data suggests that the spiral profile was superior to the indented profile due possibly to the compromised integrity of the strand from the impact of stress raisers when creating the indented profile. No study was carried on the button indented profile cable bolts.

40|$|The large {{range of}} length scales present within {{accelerator}} magnets suggests {{the incorporation of}} a hierarchical structure into computational models. Evaluation of the strain state present within the superconducting filaments is {{necessary in order to}} determine the critical current of Nb 3 Sn based magnets. As part of an ongoing investigation at LBNL, a three-dimensional nonlinear multiscale model is developed to investigate the behavior of Nb 3 Sn filaments due to macroscopic loading. The major building blocks within a superconducting magnet are used to represent each length scale within the multiscale model: Coil, Rutherford <b>cable,</b> <b>strand,</b> filament, Nb 3 Sn crystal lattice. Using the developed model, loads at the coil level due to precompression, thermal contraction, and Lorenz forces are translated into lattice strain within the Nb 3 Sn phase of the composite. Jc can then be calculated through use of measurements performed on bulk samples of Nb 3 Sn. In addition, the physical effects on each scale due to loading is examined. Each level of the hierarchical model is solved using Finite Element Methods, taking into account effects due to thermal contraction and plasticity. A conjugate gradient algorithm is coupled with a Netwon's method with line search in order to solve resulting systems of equations...|$|E

This report presents electromechanical {{data on a}} broad range of high-magnetic-field superconductors. The conductors that were studied fall into three general categories: Candidate conductors, experimental conductors, and reference conductors. Research on candidate conductors for fusion applications provides screening data for superconductor selection as well as engineering data for magnet design and performance analysis. The effect of axial tensile strain on critical-current density was measured for several Nb{sub 3 }Sn candidate conductors including the US-DPC (United States Demonstration Poloidal Coil) <b>cable</b> <b>strand</b> and an ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) candidate conductor. Also, data are presented on promising experimental superconductors that have strong potential for fusion applications. Axial strain measurements were made on a V{sub 3 }Ga tape conductor that has good performance at magnetic fields up to 20 T. Axial strain data are also presented for three experimental Nb{sub 3 }Sn conductors that contain dispersion hardened copper reinforcement for increased tensile strength. Finally, electromechanical characteristics were measured for three different Nb{sub 3 }Sn reference conductors from the first and second VAMAS (Versailles Project on Advanced Materials and Standards) international Nb{sub 3 }Sn critical-current round robins.

40|$|International audienceElectrical contact {{crimping}} is {{a mechanical}} fastening process {{commonly used in}} aeronautical and aero spatial applications. In order to ensure the perfect electrical conduction and acceptable mechanical properties, the assembly has to fulfill some drastic holding force criteria. This outfit is directly dependent on the indentation depth {{at the end of}} crimping, on the materials properties and on the geometrical dimensions. The feedback generally reveals that an over crimping will lead to the cable breakage whereas an under crimping will be characterized by the cable sliding into the contact during pulling. The optimal behavior is a combination of both phenomena: the cable must become thinner before slipping into the contact. Numerical simulation is an efficient tool to limit the tedious experimental tests. It is the main topic of our work. This paper deals with prediction of the failure type and the force level required to tear out a contact crimped on multi strand cable. Different parameters impact has been numerically studied. In order to simulate the contact tensile test, crimping simulation has to be performed. The first step is then to be able to simulate accurately the crimping stage by using appropriate behavior laws and realistic conditions. One difficulty is linked to the small size of our objects. The first one is a 19 strands cable recorded DR 22. Each <b>cable</b> <b>strand</b> is about 0. 15 mm diameter. The second sample is a 1 mm diameter cylindrical copper contact. It measure 7 mm long. The way to determine the behavior law parameters is succinctly described. Geometries and mechanical fields are obtained and then exported in the mechanical holding model to ensure realistic prediction. Impact of various parameters on the pulling results is discussed. Pulling simulation results are compared to experimental values. The prediction of breakage mechanisms is also studied...|$|E
40|$|The {{multistrand}} NbTi conductors for the Poloidal Field (PF) Coils of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) {{are subjected}} to heavy transverse loading due to the Lorentz forces in the coils. The current in the multistage Cable-In-Conduit Conductors (CICC) exceeds 50 kA and the magnetic field reaches {{up to more than}} 6 T for a few tens of thousands of pulses. The large transverse forces, accumulating from strand to strand over the cable cross-section, cause a severe deformation of the cable bundle inside the conduit and this goes along with electromagnetic, mechanical, and thermohydraulic effects. In order to study the electromagnetic and mechanical behaviour in more detail, a Cryogenic Cable Press is build to simulate the effect of the Lorentz forces on a conductor comparable to the present design for ITER in magnet operating conditions. The magnetisation of the conductor (and from this the coupling loss expressed in nτ) and the interstrand resistance (Rc) between various strands and strand bundles inside the cable can be measured along the loading history, starting at virgin condition and accordingly subjected to various loads. The results, all obtained on eight full-size ITER type NbTi conductor samples with a variety of <b>cable</b> <b>strand</b> layout and coatings, are reported here. A consistent correlation is found between the experimental AC loss and interstrand contact resistance (Rc) results. It is also observed that there is a strong impact of cyclic loading on the AC loss and Rc which may change up to orders of magnitude. The variation of the AC loss due to transverse cyclic loading of CICC conductors in ITER coils can be accomplished by reducing the void fraction. The results point out that cyclic loading with a significant number of cycles, sufficient to reach a saturation after having passed the peak transverse resistance, should be included in next tests on large NbTi CICC's and PF Model Coils as the AC loss and ability of current sharing among strands will vary along the loading history...|$|E
