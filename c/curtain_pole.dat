'E's rested one end upon the mantelpiece and tied {{the other to the}} back of the easy-chair--'is idea is to twine 'imself round it and go to sleep upon it. Yes, you've got it quite right without a single blunder. I do want to get rid of 'im." ...|$|E
50|$|Tab top {{curtains}} {{are made}} with narrow straps, that loop or tie at the top edge and hung from the <b>curtain</b> <b>pole.</b> This curtain style is often designed as two stationary panels {{at the sides of}} a window.|$|E

50|$|Flat panel {{curtains}} {{are simple}} and versatile: to make them, pieces of fabric are hemmed {{on all four}} edges and the final rectangular or square piece is hung from <b>curtains</b> <b>poles</b> with clip-on rings or something similar. If pleated, the look is strongly influenced by the fullness of the pleats.|$|R
50|$|The Romans used <b>curtains</b> {{hanging from}} <b>poles</b> {{with a few}} rings. Pliny's natural history reports that the hard kernels of the cucus tree were turned to make the rings.|$|R
50|$|Grommet {{curtains}} are hung by threading the <b>curtain</b> <b>pole</b> {{through a}} hole in the top of the fabric. This could be either a cut-out hole with the edges finished by a row of stitching or it could use a grommet to prevent fraying.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Curtain</b> <b>Pole</b> is a 1909 American comedy film {{directed}} by D. W. Griffith. A {{print of the}} film still exists. The film {{was made by the}} American Mutoscope and Biograph Company when it and many other early film studios in America's first motion picture industry were based in Fort Lee, New Jersey {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E
50|$|Several {{types of}} devices are {{available}} for indoor drying. A drying rack or clotheshorse can help save space in an apartment, or clothes lines can be strung in the basement during the winter. Small loads can simply be draped over furniture or a shower <b>curtain</b> <b>pole.</b> The drying time indoors will typically be longer than outdoor drying {{because of the lack}} of direct solar radiation and the convective assistance of the wind.|$|E
40|$|The {{prep school}} {{dormitory}} was a long, white-painted {{room in which}} rows of brown wooden bedsteads were alternated with large brown dressers and separated from each other by white <b>curtains</b> on <b>poles.</b> The Sister told Janet these were called alcoves, gave her the corner one, and left her to unpack. It was ugly and very large and still, but when Janet had pulled her curtains she didn 2 ̆ 7 t feel alone. They worked just like the shower curtains in hotels. Then she opened both her windows. At least she had two. The other alcoves had only one window...|$|R
50|$|Curtain {{hardware}} includes {{products like}} hooks, curtain rings, curtain finials, etc. These products {{are used to}} hang curtain at doors, windows, verandas, etc. <b>Curtain</b> hooks and <b>poles</b> are used to handle and move the curtains. Curtain hardware products are made of varieties of materials including metals and plastics. Mostly aluminum and iron are used for making rings, hooks, rods and poles.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{asked this}} young psychic if drapery were used {{out of respect}} to us mortals, and he replied: 'No; the forms are swathed not from sense of propriety so much as to protect the body, which is often {{incomplete}} at the extremities.' The wife and Jacob told me that at one of their meetings a naked Hercules suddenly appeared before the <b>curtain.</b> The <b>Pole</b> declared: 'He was of giant size and strength. I felt of his muscles (he was clothed only in a loincloth), and I closely studied his tremendous arms and shoulders. The medium, as you know, is a small, thin man. We called this figure [...] "the man from Mars." [...] He was at least six feet high, and strong as a lion. He rushed back into the cabinet, and came out holding the medium above his head on his upraised palms. It was very wonderful.'" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{substitution}} splice was {{the most}} popular cinematic special effect in early film fantasies, especially those that evolved from the stage tradition of the féerie. Segundo de Chomón is among the other filmmakers who used substitution splicing to create elaborate fantasy effects. D.W. Griffith's 1909 film The <b>Curtain</b> <b>Pole,</b> starring Mack Sennett, used substitution splices for comedic effect. The transformations made possible by the substitution splice were so central to early fantasy films that, in France, such films were often described simply as scènes à transformation.|$|E
5000|$|Fox Wars {{received}} positive reviews. Digital Spy and Metro {{chose the}} documentary {{as one of}} the TV picks of the day. The Daily Mail said [...] "stories he uncovered for his BBC documentary Fox Wars make surprising viewing". The Guardian journalist John Crace was surprised to learn that Britain has only 33,000 urban foxes and said:Fox Wars felt genuine. It may not have been, of course, but credit to the director and producer for succeeding in making an usual slice of people's lives look that way. My favorite person was Janet. After staying up all night hoping to bash a fox over the head with a <b>curtain</b> <b>pole,</b> she later found out it had been a cat pissing on her lawn all along. Sign her up for a second series.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Mr. Tinkles (voiced by Sean Hayes), a white Persian cat, {{plans to}} conquer the world by making all humans {{allergic}} to dogs with Professor Charles Brody's (Jeff Goldblum) research on a cure for dog allergies. He is briefly interrupted by Sophie the Maid (Miriam Margolyes) who needs to dress him upon seeing the comatose Mr. Mason (Myron Natwick). Tinkles then tells his sidekick Calico (voiced by Jon Lovitz), an Exotic Shorthair, to send in the ninja cats (voiced by Danny Mann and Billy West) he hired to steal the research. He sends in the Devon Rex ninjas but Lou manages to prevent the theft. Lou then meets a former agent and Butch's ex-sweetheart and girlfriend named Ivy (voiced by Susan Sarandon), a Saluki who belly scratches him. Disappointed that the ninja cats failed him, Mr. Tinkles then orders Calico to send a Russian Blue mercenary, whose name is Diemitir Kennelkoff, (voiced by Glenn Ficarra) to steal the research. Kennelkoff frames Lou for defecating {{in the house with}} a ball containing fake dog feces, causing Lou to be confined outside, then places a bomb on the lab door. Butch and Lou manage to get into the house through the window, but Peek and Sam are trapped outside after Lou knocks the window prop away. Kennelkoff fires a series of boomerangs around the Brodys' house causing serious damage and which break several vases and knock a lamp over; the boomerangs also cause the <b>curtain</b> <b>pole</b> to break. Lou then distracts the Russian while Butch tries to disable the bomb, but Kennelkoff turns his attention on Butch and tries to kill him. Butch gets caught in a telephone wire, then Mrs Brody comes home looking for her cell phone and surprisingly does not notice her wrecked living room. Although he suspects that dogs can see in black and white, Butch manages to escape and disables the bomb, but Kennelkoff holds out a remote that will detonate the bomb and laughs until the lab door opens and hits him. Kennelkoff is then captured and interrogated. The agent tells the gang that they pumped a few things out of Kennelkoff's stomach, including a note written by Mr. Tinkles.|$|E
5000|$|On 29 May 1889 Hoople {{applied for}} a US Patent for [...] "a new and Improved Leather-Stripping Machine" [...] that he had invented. Patent 412,503 was granted on 8 October 1889. On 17 January 1899 Edgar J. Force (born March 1847 in Canada) {{assigned}} to Hoople one-fourth of the patent for his invention of [...] "new and useful Improvements in <b>Curtain</b> or Portière <b>Pole</b> Rings and Fastenings". By 1902 Hoople was a director of Raimes & Company (established 1892). By 1909 {{he was also the}} president (having replaced his father who had been vice-president when he died in 1908), [...] a New York-based company that manufactured druggist's supplies, such as [...] "soft gelatine capsules, potassium ioxide, and galenicals".|$|R
5000|$|In live competition, {{handlers}} {{are required}} to wear an equestrian helmet and cannot use whips or sticks. The horse is only allowed, at most, to wear a halter, lead rope and may wear leg protection such as splint boots. The lead rope must be loose and the handler cannot pull on it but must remain within a designated position with their horse. [...] Competition usually consists of a course of eight or more obstacles. Examples of obstacles may include tunnels, jumps, a seesaw, passing through a <b>curtain,</b> weaving between <b>poles</b> or cones, passing through or over poles, branches, gates, hoops, water, or tarps; entering a trailer; rolling a ball, backing between two poles, stepping onto an object, standing still, carrying a light load, crossing a bridge, navigating a small maze or labyrinth, crossing over an A-frame, and so on. Courses are often timed, particularly at higher levels.|$|R
50|$|Next door is {{the ship}} room where a green wall fulfils a similar role. The {{furniture}} is in keeping, with much dark {{wood in the}} tables and cabinets. The few upholstered chairs and sofas have now faded to gentle tones.The largest bedroom, the east, is bright and airy and again has <b>curtains</b> on pull-out <b>poles.</b> The long gallery was a new space created by Lutyens, intended to echo the grand galleries of Elizabethan and Jacobean houses. The scale is much smaller, but again the use of exposed stone arches and oak beams provides a grand yet rustic feel.Further on, an upper gallery has a raised platform at one end. From here an oak door leads onto the upper battery with its spectacular views along the coastline. The music room at the castle was used by Guilhermina Suggia, a frequent visitor, and a cello is left in the room today to mark this.|$|R
5000|$|Among Colson’s {{body of work}} is {{a series}} of ‘Stick Maps’ of cities such as Cleveland, San Jose, and Baton Rouge. These sculptures are built of found lengths of {{assorted}} materials; ski <b>poles,</b> <b>curtain</b> rods, plastic pipe, wood molding - the structure becoming a metaphor for the manifold influences on a city. In another series of constructed ‘Pie Chart’ paintings (based on socio-cultural surveys), Colson mocks the deluge of analysis that is {{so much a part of}} our daily experience by playing up the material and iconographic elements to such a degree that any actual understanding is subverted. Colson’s 'Elliptical Models' paintings incorporate, at once, the ordinary and the profound - while suggesting preposterous hierarchies using the formal through-line of the circle. Sharon Mizota, in her Los Angeles Times review of Colson’s 2010 exhibition at William Griffin Gallery (now Kayne Griffin Corcoran), characterized these works as “grand and hilarious testaments to the leveling effect of data overload. [...] "One piece includes concentric circles depicting ‘5 Steps to Happiness,’ ‘Flea Life Cycle,’ ‘The Cycle of Addiction,’ and for good measure, a flange gasket. The piece levels the distinctions between these wide-ranging phenomena in an absurdly uninformative information graphic.” More recently, Colson has designed and created large-scale outdoor sculptures.|$|R
60|$|But, Jessie, I {{will write}} about you no more. This is an autumn evening, wet and wild. There {{is only one}} cloud in the sky, but it <b>curtains</b> it from <b>pole</b> to pole. The wind cannot rest; it hurries sobbing over hills of sullen outline, {{colourless}} with twilight and mist. Rain has beat all day on that church tower. It rises dark from the stony enclosure of its graveyard. The nettles, the long grass, and the tombs all drip with wet. This evening reminds me too forcibly of another evening some years ago--a howling, rainy autumn evening too--when certain who had that day performed a pilgrimage to a grave new-made in a heretic cemetery sat near a wood fire on the hearth of a foreign dwelling. They were merry and social, but they each knew that a gap, never to be filled, {{had been made in}} their circle. They knew they had lost something whose absence could never be quite atoned for so long as they lived; and they knew that heavy falling rain was soaking into the wet earth which covered their lost darling, and that the sad, sighing gale was mourning above her buried head. The fire warmed them; life and friendship yet blessed them; but Jessie lay cold, coffined, solitary--only the sod screening her from the storm.|$|R
60|$|Who {{does not}} know how terrible are those {{preparations}} for house-moving;--how infinite in number are the articles which must be packed, how inexpressibly uncomfortable is the period of packing, and how poor and tawdry is the aspect of one's belongings while they are thus in a state of dislocation? Nowadays people who understand the world, and have money commensurate with their understanding, have learned the way of shunning all these disasters, and of leaving the work to the hands of persons paid for doing it. The crockery is left in the cupboards, the books on the shelves, the wine in the bins, the <b>curtains</b> on their <b>poles,</b> and the family that is understanding goes for a fortnight to Brighton. At the end of that time the crockery is comfortably settled in other cupboards, the books on other shelves, the wine in other bins, the curtains are hung on other poles, and all is arranged. But Mrs Dale and her daughters understood nothing of such a method of moving as this. The assistance of the village carpenter in filling certain cases that he had made was all that they knew how to obtain beyond that of their own two servants. Every article had to pass through the hands of some one of the family; and as they felt almost overwhelmed by the extent of the work to be done, they began it much sooner than was necessary, so that it became evident as they advanced in their work, {{that they would have to}} pass a dreadfully dull, stupid, uncomfortable week at last, among their boxes and cases, in all the confusion of dismantled furniture.|$|R
