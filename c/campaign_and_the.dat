5|$|Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine (4 February 1740 – 28 August 1793) was a French general. As a young {{officer in}} the Bourbon Royal army, {{he served in the}} Seven Years' War. In the American Revolutionary War he joined Rochambeau's Expédition Particulière (Special Expedition) {{supporting}} the American colonists.

5|$|After {{staying at}} Eretria {{for a few}} days, the Persians made {{their way down the}} coast towards Attica. The Persians dropped the {{captured}} Eretrians off on the island of Aegilia, before landing at the bay of Marathon in Attica. The Persians' next target was Athens. However, the Athenians had marched out from Athens to meet the Persians, and blocked the exits from the plains of Marathon. After several days of stalemate, the Athenians finally resolved to attack the Persians, winning a famous victory at the ensuing Battle of Marathon. After the battle, the remaining Persians fled to their ships, picked up the Eretrians from Aegilia, and then sailed back to Asia Minor, thereby ending the <b>campaign,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first Persian invasion of Greece.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{bitterness}} of the <b>campaign</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> timing of the murder, speculation mounted that Sharp {{had been killed by}} an Anti-Relief partisan. For some time, rumors traveled that Darby was implicated in his death. Sharp's political rival, John J. Crittenden, tried to blunt such accusations by personally introducing a resolution condemning the murder and offering a $3000 reward for the capture of the assassin. The trustees of the city of Frankfort added a reward of $1000, and an additional $2000 reward was raised from private sources. In the 1825 session of the General Assembly, a measure to form Sharp County from Muhlenberg County died on the floor due to the tumultuous politics of the session.|$|E

5|$|Fillmore {{was active}} in the discussions of presidential {{candidates}} that preceded the Whig National Convention for the 1840 race.

Fillmore did not attend the convention, but was gratified when it nominated General William Henry Harrison for president, with former Virginia senator John Tyler his running mate. Fillmore organized Western New York for the Harrison <b>campaign,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> national ticket was elected, while Fillmore easily gained a fourth term in the House.|$|E

Initially made up of one Bristol Beaufighter and two P-40 Kittyhawk wings, No.1 TAF was augmented in 1945 by No.80 Wing, {{commanded by}} Group Captain Clive Caldwell.

5|$|In 1595 Żółkiewski {{participated in}} the Moldavian <b>campaign</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> battle of Cecora near the Prut river.

When the Cossacks surrendered Nalivaiko and other leaders of the uprising to him he guaranteed their fair treatment. But Nalivaiko was subsequently executed in Warsaw, and a mob of Polish soldiers massacred the other prisoners, {{which led to a}} deterioration in Polish-Cossack relations. In 1600 Żółkiewski returned to Moldova, where he took part in the victorious battle of Bukowo.|$|E
