5|$|Huw Edwards is a Welsh <b>conductor</b> {{currently}} serving as {{music director of}} Olympia, Washington's Olympia Symphony Orchestra and orchestra <b>conductor</b> at the University of Puget Sound. Edwards' conducting career began at age seventeen when he became {{music director of the}} Maidstone Opera Company in England. He later attended the University of Surrey, where he conducted the college orchestra along with an ensemble that he formed himself. At age twenty-three, he won a conducting competition which sent him to Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. He then held a lecturer position at Northwestern University in Chicago, where he was also a doctoral candidate. Edwards was <b>conductor</b> and music director of the Portland Youth Philharmonic from 1995 to 2002 followed by the Seattle Youth Symphony from 2002 to 2005. He served as music director of the Portland Columbia Symphony Orchestra from 2000 to 2012 and has been with the Olympia Symphony Orchestra since 2002.

25|$|Just as the {{resistance}} of a <b>conductor</b> depends upon temperature, {{the resistance}} of a <b>conductor</b> depends upon strain. By placing a <b>conductor</b> under tension (a form of stress that leads to strain {{in the form of}} stretching of the <b>conductor),</b> the length of the section of <b>conductor</b> under tension increases and its cross-sectional area decreases. Both these effects contribute to increasing {{the resistance of}} the strained section of <b>conductor.</b> Under compression (strain in the opposite direction), the resistance of the strained section of <b>conductor</b> decreases. See the discussion on strain gauges for details about devices constructed {{to take advantage of this}} effect.|$|E

40|$|Stretchable {{electronics}} are an emergent {{class of}} electronics that can retain their electric functionality under large mechanical deformation, such as stretching, bending and compression. Like traditional electric circuits, stretchable electronics rely on electrical <b>conductors,</b> {{but in this}} specific instance the <b>conductors</b> must also be stretchable. This thesis research had three goals: (1) fabricate elastically stretchable <b>conductors</b> that retain their electrical conductance when stretched by tens of percent of strain; (2) understand the underlying stretching mechanism of gold <b>conductors</b> on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates; (3) produce a special device- a stretchable microelectrode array, which contains a matrix of stretchable <b>conductors</b> that enables {{a new approach to}} studying traumatic brain injury. We first developed and optimized the micro-fabrication process to make elastically stretchable thin gold film <b>conductors</b> on PDMS substrates. The <b>conductors</b> can retain electrical conduction while being stretched reversibly to 140 % uniaxially and 16 % radially.

25|$|This {{computation}} {{using the}} induced EMF method {{is identical to}} the computation of the mutual impedance between two dipoles (with infinitesimal <b>conductor</b> radius) separated by the distance a. Because the field at or beyond the edge of an antenna's cylindrical <b>conductor</b> at a distance a is only dependent on the current distribution along the <b>conductor,</b> and not the radius of the <b>conductor,</b> that field is used to compute the mutual impedance between that filamentary antenna and the actual position of the <b>conductor</b> with a radius a.
