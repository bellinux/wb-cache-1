The RCA connector provided only baseband video, so to connect the CGA card to a standard television set required a separate RF modulator unless the TV had an RCA jack though with the former combined with an amplifier sometimes was more practical since one could then hook up an antenna to the amplifier and get wireless video.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "console game" [...] {{is played}} on a {{specialized}} electronic device that connects to a common television set or <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> <b>monitor,</b> unlike PCs, which can run all sorts of computer programs, a console is a dedicated video game platform manufactured by a specific company. Usually consoles only run games developed for it, or games from other platform made by the same company, but never games developed by its direct competitor, even if the same game is available on different platforms. It often comes with a specific game controller. Major console platforms include Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo.|$|E

5000|$|Television studios use {{stand-alone}} <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> <b>monitors</b> {{to check}} and judge their output picture quality. These are usually high-end professional broadcast monitors {{that are used}} to view the output of professional video cameras, VTRs, character generators, telecines and DDRs. They can also be used when new video devices are being tested. Most commercial composite monitors have no audio support or speakers, as the audio system is processed through high-quality audio equipment.|$|R

5000|$|The Video Display Module 1 (VDM-1) was the {{original}} video display interface for S-100 bus systems. [...] The board generates sixteen 64-character lines of upper and lower case typeface on any standard <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> <b>monitor</b> or a modified TV set. Utilizing a 1,024 byte (1K) segment of system memory, the VDM-1 provided memory-mapped I/O for high performance, and also included hardware support for scrolling. The VDM-1 Video Board was a great improvement over using a teletype machine or a serial attached terminals, and was popular for owners of other S-100 bus systems such as the IMSAI 8080.|$|E

5000|$|All Apple II {{machines}} featured an RCA jack {{providing a}} rough NTSC, PAL, or SECAM composite video output (on non-NTSC machines before the Apple IIe this output is black-and-white only). This enabled {{the computer to}} be connected to any <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> <b>monitor</b> conforming to the same standard for which the machine was configured. However the quality of this output was sketchy; the sync signalling was close enough for monitors—which are fairly forgiving—but did not conform closely enough to standards to be suitable for broadcast applications, or even input to a video recorder, without intervening processing. (The exception was the Extended Back version of the Bell & Howell branded black II Plus, which did provide proper video sync, as well as other media oriented features.) ...|$|E

50|$|A {{composite}} monitor is any analog {{video display}} that receives input {{in the form}} of an analog <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> signal to a defined specification. A <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> signal encodes all information on a single conductor; a composite cable has a single live conductor plus earth. Other equipment with display functionality includes monitors with more advanced interfaces and connectors giving a better picture, including analog VGA, and digital DVI, HDMI, and DisplayPort; and television (TV) receivers which are self-contained, receiving and displaying video RF broadcasts received with an internal tuner. <b>Video</b> <b>monitors</b> are used for displaying computer output, closed-circuit television (e.g. security cameras) and other applications requiring a two-dimensional monochrome or colour image.|$|R
5000|$|The Osborne {{corporation}} {{offered a}} [...] "Screen Pac" [...] 80-column upgrade {{that could be}} switched between original 52 column and 80 column modes. Osborne 1 systems with the 80-column upgrade have an RCA jack installed on the front panel to allow users to connect an external <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> <b>monitor.</b> This modification was developed in Australia by Geoff Cohen and Stuart Ritchie and taken to the US by Stuart who turned up unannounced and sat outside Adam Osborne's office for two days. Osborne bought the mod {{as soon as they}} saw it and both of them worked with the Company to implement the mod. As a nod toward where it came from it was called the [...] "Koala Project". Geoff went on to invent many other upgrades for Osborne's and was regarded as the Australian expert on the computers.|$|E

50|$|Originally, these {{monitors}} {{were used}} for commercial studios. <b>Composite</b> <b>video</b> first saw home use for dubbing tapes on VCRs. Early computers, both commercial and amateur, mostly used teleprinters for output; simple home models might simply display an array of lights to be interpreted as binary information. Later {{the concept of the}} TV Typewriter was born, effectively the <b>video</b> <b>monitor</b> used for digital information; this was implemented as dedicated monitors and as interfaces to the television receivers present in many homes. Many computers incorporated a display. From the late 1970s stand-alone composite monitors came into use, including by the Apple II, Commodore VIC 20/64/128, Atari, the IBM PC with CGA card, some computers compatible with it, and other home and business computers of the 1980s. These computers had <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> outputs, and sometimes composite monitors bundled with the systems. Some computer companies separately sold their own composite monitors for use with their computers.|$|R
5000|$|The four-pin mini-DIN {{connector}} is {{the most}} common of several S-Video connector types. The same mini-DIN connector is used in the Apple Desktop Bus for Macintosh computers and the two cable types can be interchanged. Other connector variants include seven-pin locking [...] "dub" [...] connectors used on many professional S-VHS machines, and dual [...] "Y" [...] and [...] "C" [...] BNC connectors, often used for S-Video patch panels. Early Y/C <b>video</b> <b>monitors</b> often used phono (RCA connector) that were switchable between Y/C and <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> input. Though the connectors are different, the Y/C signals for all types are compatible.|$|R
50|$|<b>Composite</b> <b>video</b> {{connections}} use {{a single}} RCA plug on each end. <b>Composite</b> <b>video</b> is standard on all AV receivers {{allowing for the}} switching of video devices such as VHS players, cable boxes, and game consoles.

50|$|Sync on composite, {{not to be}} {{confused}} with composite sync, is commonly used on devices that output both <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> and RGB over SCART. The RGB signal is used for color information, while the <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> signal is only used to extract the sync information. This is generally an inferior sync method, as this often causes checkerboards to appear on an image, but the image quality is still much sharper than standalone <b>composite</b> <b>video.</b>|$|R
50|$|Older {{professional}} mixers {{worked with}} <b>composite</b> <b>video,</b> analog signal inputs.

50|$|<b>Composite</b> <b>video</b> and RF (channel 3/channel 4) F-connectors {{were two}} ways of {{connecting}} entertainment devices to television sets. This {{was not so much}} of a format as the RF option was an adaptation necessary for plugging in such devices on television sets that did not come equipped with a <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> input. RF was a noticeably inferior substitute. The competition between options mainly manifested itself as competition between television set manufacturers and their individual models that offered <b>composite</b> <b>video.</b>|$|R

Like D-1, D-2 stores uncompressed digital video on a tape cassette; however, it stores a <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> signal, rather than component video as with D-1. While component video is superior for advanced editing, especially when chroma key effects are used, <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> is more compatible with most existing analog facilities.|$|R
