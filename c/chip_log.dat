5|$|Mycena galericulata is saprobic, {{and grows}} on {{decaying}} hardwood and softwood sticks, <b>chips,</b> <b>logs,</b> and stumps. It can also grow from submerged wood, which may {{give it a}} terrestrial appearance. It typically grows in small clusters or sometimes singly. The fungus fruits from late spring to early winter. A study of litter-decomposing fungi in a coniferous forest in Finland showed that M.galericulata produces extracellular hydrolytic enzymes in the humus and eluvial soil, including β-glucosidase, β-xylosidase, α-glucosidase, butyrate esterase and sulphatase. The enzymes form complexes with inorganic and organic particles in the soil and break down (depolymerize) biopolymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and starch, which contributes to the cycling of carbon and nutrients. The presence of lead contamination in the soil decreases both the growth and the extracellular hydrolytic enzyme activity of M.galericulata.|$|R

40|$|Chip {{moisture}} content and especially its uniformity impact kraft pulping. However, {{the effect of}} pulp log {{moisture content}} on chip quality during chip production is not well known. Chip size distribution is important in kraft pulping as it impacts chemical use, pulp quality and recovery. This study investigated the influence of two pulp log drying periods (1 and 2 weeks) on chip moisture content and chip size distribution when <b>chipping</b> eucalypt pulp <b>logs.</b> In addition, the effect of three log classes (base, middle and top <b>logs)</b> on <b>chip</b> moisture content and chip size distribution were also analysed.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that a large {{proportion}} of available logging residues intended for extraction will not reach the energy-conversion industry, because some are lost during transportation or left on the clear-felled area. However, there is little understanding of where logging residue losses occur in the supply chain. In this study, the distribution of logging residues for two methods (dried- and fresh-stacked method) to extract logging residues were studied in one clear-felled area. In addition, residue fractions were examined in a detailed comparison. Even though the fresh-stacked method left somewhat more logging residues at the clear-felled area, the differences are small between the methods. Approximately 30 % of the total amount of logging residues was left behind between the harvester heaps, with an additional 10 %– 15 % under these heaps and approximately 2 %– 3 % beneath the windrows. The final product that was delivered to the energy-conversion industry was very similar, regardless of the extraction method used. The delivered <b>chipped</b> <b>logging</b> residues had moisture contents of 37 % and 36 % following fresh- and dried-stacked methods respectively, and in both cases the needle content in the processed logging residues was approximately 10 %.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{spatially}} elaborate partial equilibrium {{model for the}} forest chips market in Finland and demonstrate its use by examining the targets outlined by {{the government for the}} increase in the use of forest chips for energy. Because the supply of stumps and logging residues is tied to roundwood harvests, reaching the target seems unrealistic without investments in the new production capacity of the forest industry. In particular, the industries using sawlogs would {{need to get back to}} the high levels of production seen a few years ago. For instance, policies leading to the increased use of wood in construction would support the renewable energy goals as well. Also subsidies for CHP-production at sawmills would facilitate that. Tight carbon policy alone would lead to considerable increases in the use of forest chips, but because the prices of the CO 2 emission permits are difficult to foresee, subsidies are needed to decrease the uncertainty faced by the market actors. The government is planning to set subsidies for wood-based electricity, which would be tied to the carbon price. Based on our results, we recommend binding the potential subsidies for chipping energy wood to the carbon price as well.

40|$|We {{conducted}} a {{comparative study of}} <b>chipping</b> <b>logging</b> residues at the roadside landing or at the yarder pad, the latter inaccessible to heavy road vehicles. Field data was collected from real operations in the Italian mountain, and it was used for building a simulation model that could generalize {{the results of the}} study. The model was built with Arena 14 and carefully reflected interaction delays between individual units along the chain. Chipping at the pad with a chipper and two shuttles was the best compromise solution of low supply cost and fuel consumption. At a mean cost of € 22. 7 per fresh tonne, this solution was 10 % cheaper than chipping at the landing. Using three chip shuttles did not allow a meaningful reduction of supply cost over a two-shuttle chain, but resulted in a 7 % increase of fuel consumption. The distance between the pad and the roadside landing was by far {{the most important factor in}} determining supply cost, and accounted for 80 % of the variability in the data, for both systems.

40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a thesis as been {{implemented}} during the spring term 2009 at the University of Gävle. The company Bruks produces mobile chippers which are used for <b>chipping</b> <b>logging</b> slash, roundwood and parts of trees. The chipper is powered by a separate diesel engine and the chipper can be assembled on trucks, trailers or some other carrier vehicles. When the chip has passed the chipper drum, the chip is collected in an integrated bin which is mounted on the vehicles frame with dumping yokes. When these dumping yokes were designed they were probably created with large material dimensions. The aim with the degree project is hence to study the strengths of materials and, if possible, to suggest an arrangement that can decrease the total weight on the dumping yoke on Bruks´ mobile chippers 805 CT. The CAD-program Pro/ENGINEER was used during the project for outlining the 2 Ddrawings, as distributed of constructors on Bruks, to solid 3 D-parts. The three-dimensional assembly from Pro/ENGINEER was transferred to Pro/MECHANICA. The construction is complex and contains many components, and therefore the model has been divided into two different parts, the external and the internal dumping yoke. The conclusion of the degree project is that the product generally is not over dimensioned. However there are many options for optimizing, mainly on the external dumping yokes...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} work was to {{describe}} the wood fuel market of Ukraine and the Republic of Belarus, to estimate wood fuel potential and to research opportunities of wood fuel trading. Nowadays the wood waste, wood residues and by-products {{are becoming more and}} more potential raw materials for energy production. Against the background of unstable prices of traditional energy sources and environmental degradation, European States are planning to get 12 % of energy from alternative sources already in 2010.

The most promising directions of wood fuel trading are developed wood fuel markets of Northern countries, Austria, Germany as well as actively developing markets of Poland and Hungary. At the long distance truck and sea transportation are the most appropriate. At a short distance cheap transportation by rail is more suitable. Thereby export is a potential opportunity for development of wood fuel production and in the future for usage in the researched countries...|$|R

50|$|Dead {{reckoning}} {{begins with}} a known position, or fix, which is then advanced, mathematically or directly on the chart, by means of recorded heading, speed, and time. Speed can be determined by many methods. Before modern instrumentation, it was determined aboard ship using a <b>chip</b> <b>log.</b> More modern methods include pit log referencing engine speed (e.g. in rpm) against a table of total displacement (for ships) or referencing one's indicated airspeed fed by the pressure from a pitot tube. This measurement is converted to an equivalent airspeed based upon known atmospheric conditions and measured errors in the indicated airspeed system. A naval vessel uses a device called a pit sword (rodmeter), which uses two sensors on a metal rod to measure the electromagnetic variance caused by the ship moving through water. This change is then converted to ship's speed. Distance is determined by multiplying the speed and the time. This initial position can then be adjusted resulting in an estimated position by {{taking into account the}} current (known as set and drift in marine navigation). If there is no positional information available, a new dead reckoning plot may start from an estimated position. In this case subsequent dead reckoning positions will have taken into account estimated set and drift.|$|E

Logging residues, as a by-product of FT harvesting, present an easily accessible bioenergy resource, but high portions of fine particles and contaminants like earth particles and stones make them a complex and difficult fuel, as they affect storage capability, conversion efficiency, or emission rates adversely. The present research focuses on the productivity and performance of a star screen, which {{was used to remove}} fine and oversize particles from previously chipped, fresh Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.)

Time studies of the star screen were carried out to estimate screening productivity and costs. Furthermore, 115 samples were collected from all material streams, which were assessed for particle size distribution, calorific value, ash content, and component and elemental composition. Average productivity was 20. 6 tonnes (t) per productive system hour (PSH 15), corresponding to screening costs of 9. 02 €/t. The results indicated that the screening of <b>chipped</b> <b>logging</b> residues with a star screen influenced material characteristics of the medium fraction, as it decreased the ash content, the incidence of fine particles, and the nutrient content. The different screen settings had a noticeable influence on the quality characteristics of the screening products.
