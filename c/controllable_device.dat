But the clones kept on coming in the US, Italy, Korea, France, and other countries, trying to avoid the patents by changing the foothold and even the shape (some companies produced square and even decagon shaped clones) as well as the firm hip support which alone made the Aerotrim a <b>controllable</b> <b>device.</b> Over the following years international lawyers were hired to handle the various court cases. Contactos basically won all of them, but the legal fees soon outweighed the company’s income from this project and Contactos had to keep on financing it through other business activities.|$|E
50|$|In 1917 Handley Page and his {{aerodynamicist}} R.O. Bothwell started wind-tunnel experiments {{intended to}} combine the low drag of high aspect ratio wings with the delayed stall at high angles of attack of a low aspect ratio wing. The first attempts involved using a wing divided into separate square panels by slots running chordwise, but this produced no significant result. The idea of a wing divided into two sections by a narrow spanwise slot was then tried, and the first experiment, using a slot at 25% chord in a RAF 15 section wing gave an increase in lift of 25%. The shape and position of the slots {{was found to be}} critical, and a series of wind-tunnel test were made during 1918-19 under conditions of great secrecy, since Handley Page realised the commercial value of the idea and consequently wanted it kept secret until it could be patented. He delayed doing this until he was able to file a patent for a <b>controllable</b> <b>device</b> in which the slot could be opened and closed by the pilot. This was granted on 24 October 1919. The principle had been independently arrived at by Gustav Lachmann, a German pilot and engineer: Lachmann attempted to patent the idea a few weeks before Handley Page, but his patent application was initially refused. When his patent was retroactively granted, he contacted Handley Page but rather than getting involved in a legal dispute the two men arrived at a mutually satisfactory arrangement, with the patents being shared and Lachmann accepting a post as a consultant for Handley Page. He was later to become the company's head of design and later director of research.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} coordinated {{real-time}} voltage regulation method for hybrid AC/DC medium distribution networks. This method makes {{full use of}} converter-based <b>controllable</b> <b>devices,</b> such as DGs, ESSs, and the VSCs between AC and DC lines. To eliminating possible conflicting controls, an optimal partition method is developed, which helps to determine suitable devices to retain node voltages against various uncertainties. This partition method commits to multiple objectives, in which both efficiency and capability of real and reactive power regulations are considered. Through a sensitivity analysis method, real and reactive power outputs of <b>controllable</b> <b>devices</b> can be adjusted to retain nodal voltages in real time operations. As power balances of both AC and DC grids are considered, these adjustments tend to be coordinated and help to minimize DG curtailments and load shedding. Finally, based on resultant network partition, priorities of control actions can be evaluated, according to which corresponding devices are controlled with special and temporal coordination.|$|R

A sophisticated algorithm using ac optimal power flow (OPF) is often unnecessarily detailed {{for the purpose of}} valuating such projects.

The present work outlines past, present, and future developments in heat pump technology and indicates key areas of improvement. One method of improvement, the capacity controlled heat pump, has been studied in detail. An analysis of conventional and capacity controlled air-to-air heat pumps has been performed, using detailed computer simulations. New system sizing guidelines are outlined for capacity controlled units, resulting in as much as a 30 % per year energy savings over conventional heat pumps in two of the six locations studied. Economic studies, comparing conventional and capacity controlled heat pumps to gas and electrical resistance heat, with and without air conditioning, indicate that capacity controlled heat pumps could soon be superior to gas heating in some locations, depending on energy prices. All of the economic studies have been done for a range of gas and electricity prices, and include amortization of capital costs as well as operating costs.
