It is found that the Turkish twin crises cannot be explained by using any individual generation of models, namely first generation models, second generation models or third generation models. Instead, a combination of these models is more appropriate to explain the details of the twin crises. Currency crisis; speculative attack; exchange rate targeting; Turkey...|$|R
