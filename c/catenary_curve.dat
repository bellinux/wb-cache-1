5|$|Another element {{widely used}} by Gaudí was the {{catenary}} arch. He had studied geometry thoroughly {{when he was}} young, studying numerous articles about engineering, a field that praised {{the virtues of the}} <b>catenary</b> <b>curve</b> as a mechanical element, one which at that time, however, was used only in the construction of suspension bridges. Gaudí was the first to use this element in common architecture. Catenary arches in works like the Casa Milà, the Teresian College, the crypt of the Colònia Güell and the Sagrada Família allowed Gaudí to add an element of great strength to his structures, given that the catenary distributes the weight it regularly carries evenly, being affected only by self-canceling tangential forces.|$|E
5|$|Early {{urban renewal}} efforts in St. Louis coincided with efforts {{to plan a}} riverfront {{memorial}} to honor Thomas Jefferson, which would later include the famous Gateway Arch. Work {{began in the early}} 1930s on acquisition and demolition of the forty-block area where the memorial would stand; the only remnant of Laclede's street grid that was preserved was north of the Eads Bridge (in what is now known as Laclede's Landing). The only building in the area to remain was the Old Cathedral. Demolition continued until the outbreak of World War II, when the area began {{to be used as a}} parking lot. The project stalled until a design competition for the memorial was launched. In 1948, Finnish architect Eero Saarinen's design for an inverted and weighted <b>catenary</b> <b>curve</b> won the competition; however, groundbreaking did not occur until 1954. The Arch topped out in October 1965. A museum and visitors' center was completed underneath the structure, opening in 1976. In addition to attracting millions of visitors, the Arch ultimately spurred more than $500 million in downtown construction during the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} report discusses the design approach of catenary vaults {{in the application}} of low-cost housing. It investigates the most efficient design, materials and construction methods to provide a sustainable and durable solution to low-cost housing. Investigation into various materials was carried out and two specific blocks are used in the construction process: the dry-stack interlocking block and the splitter-brick block. An innovative method of designing <b>catenary</b> <b>curves</b> was developed: The Segmental Equilibrium Method. This design approach focuses on equilibrium equations to define the geometric shape of a catenary under various loading. The method incorporates dead, live and wind loads.

50|$|By modifying {{individual}} {{parameters of}} these models Gaudi could generate different versions of his model while being certain the resulting structure would stand in pure compression.Instead of having to manually calculate the results of parametric equations he could automatically derive {{the shape of the}} <b>catenary</b> <b>curves</b> through the force of gravity acting on the strings.|$|R

25|$|Another roulette, {{formed by}} rolling {{a line on}} a catenary, is another line. This implies that square wheels can roll {{perfectly}} smoothly on a road made {{of a series of}} bumps in the shape of an inverted <b>catenary</b> <b>curve.</b> The wheels can be any regular polygon except a triangle, but the catenary must have parameters corresponding to the shape and dimensions of the wheels.|$|E
25|$|When the rode is slack, the <b>catenary</b> <b>curve</b> {{presents}} a lower {{angle of pull}} on the anchor or mooring device than {{would be the case}} if it were nearly straight. This enhances the performance of the anchor and raises the level of force it will resist before dragging. To maintain the catenary shape in the presence of wind, a heavy chain is needed, so that only larger ships in deeper water can rely on this effect. Smaller boats also rely on catenary to maintain maximum holding power.|$|E
50|$|A {{stressed}} {{ribbon bridge}} also has {{one or more}} <b>catenary</b> <b>curves</b> and a deck laid on the main cables. Unlike a simple suspension bridge however, a stressed ribbon bridge has a stiff deck, usually due to the addition of compression elements (concrete slabs) laid over the main cables. This stiffness allows the bridge to be much heavier, wider, and more stable.|$|R

25|$|Over {{the course}} of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, {{developments}} in mathematics and the study of statics led to a more precise formalization of the ideas of the traditional constructive practices of arches and vaults, and there was a diffusion of studies on the most stable form for these structures: the <b>catenary</b> <b>curve.</b> Robert Hooke, who first articulated that a thin arch was comparable to an inverted hanging chain, may have advised Wren on how to achieve the crossing dome of St. Paul's Cathedral. Wren's structural system became the standard for large domes well into the 19th century. The ribs in Guarino Guarini's San Lorenzo and Il Sidone were shaped as catenary arches. The idea of a large oculus in a solid dome revealing a second dome originated with him. He also established the oval dome as a reconciliation of the longitudinal plan church favored by the liturgy of the Counter-Reformation and the centralized plan favored by idealists. Because of the imprecision of oval domes in the Rococo period, drums were problematic and the domes instead often rested directly on arches or pendentives.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{voussoir}} arches, {{which require}} support for each element until the keystone is in place, domes are stable during construction as each level is made {{a complete and}} self-supporting ring. The upper portion of a masonry dome is always in compression and is supported laterally, so it does not collapse except as a whole unit {{and a range of}} deviations from the ideal in this shallow upper cap are equally stable. Because voussoir domes have lateral support, they can be made much thinner than corresponding arches of the same span. For example, a hemispherical dome can be 2.5 times thinner than a semicircular arch, and a dome with the profile of an equilateral arch can be thinner still. The optimal shape for a masonry dome of equal thickness is a revolved <b>catenary</b> <b>curve,</b> similar to the curve of a parabola. This shape provides for perfect compression, with none of the tension or bending forces that masonry is weak against. The pointed profiles of many Gothic domes more closely approximate this optimal shape than do hemispheres, which were favored by Roman and Byzantine architects due to the circle being considered the most perfect of forms. Adding a weight {{to the top of the}} pointed dome, such as the heavy cupola at the top of Florence Cathedral, changes the optimal shape to perfectly match the actual pointed shape of the dome.|$|E
500|$|Another of Gaudí's {{innovations}} {{in the technical}} realm {{was the use of}} a scale model to calculate structures: for the church of the Colònia Güell, he built a 1:10 scale model with a height of [...] in a shed next to the building. There, he set up a model that had strings with small bags full of birdshot hanging from them. On a drawing board that was attached to the ceiling he drew the floor of the church, and he hung the strings (for the catenaries) with the birdshot (for the weight) from the supporting points of the building—columns, intersection of walls. These weights produced a <b>catenary</b> <b>curve</b> in both the arches and vaults. At that point, he took a picture that, when inverted, showed the structure for columns and arches that Gaudí was looking for. Gaudí then painted over these photographs with gouache or pastel. The outline of the church defined, he recorded every single detail of the building: architectural, stylistic and decorative.|$|E

2500|$|In free-hanging chains, {{the force}} exerted is uniform {{with respect to}} length of the chain, and so the chain follows the <b>catenary</b> <b>curve.</b> The {{same is true of}} a simple {{suspension}} bridge or [...] "catenary bridge," [...] where the roadway follows the cable.|$|E
2500|$|This {{hyperbolic}} cosine function describes {{the shape of}} a catenary. A chain that supports only its own weight forms a catenary; the chain is purely in tension. Likewise, an inverted catenary arch that supports only its own weight is purely in compression, with no shear. The catenary arch is the stablest of all arches since [...] "the thrust passes down through the legs and is absorbed in the foundations, whereas in other arches, the pressure tends to force the legs apart." [...] The Gateway Arch itself is not a common catenary, but a more general curve of the form y=Acosh (Bx). This makes it an inverted weighted catenary. Saarinen chose a weighted catenary over a normal <b>catenary</b> <b>curve</b> because it looked less pointed and less steep. In 1959, he caused some confusion about the actual shape of the arch when he wrote, [...] "This arch is not a true parabola, as is often stated. Instead it is a catenary curve—the curve of a hanging chain—a curve in which the forces of thrust are continuously kept within the center of the legs of the arch." [...] William V. Thayer, a professor of mathematics at St. Louis Community College, later wrote to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch calling {{attention to the fact that}} the structure was a weighted catenary.|$|E

In the rear of the van was a glass window, which she cleaned with her pocket-handkerchief every market-day before starting. Looking at the van from the back, the spectator could thus see through its interior a square piece of the same sky and landscape that he saw without, but intruded on by the profiles of the seated passengers, who, as they rumbled onward, their lips moving and heads nodding in animated private converse, remained in happy unconsciousness that their mannerisms and facial peculiarities were sharply defined to the public eye.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Overhead-line power {{conductors}} do not run {{parallel to the}} ground; they actually sag between adjacent towers, defining <b>catenary</b> <b>curves.</b> However, {{in the analysis of}} inductive coupling phenomena between power lines and neighboring circuits, the standard approach to deal with the sag effect is to assign a constant average height to power line conductors. The purpose of this research is to assess the accuracy of such an ordinary procedure. To do that, two different approaches are developed in order to more accurately account for the sag effect: a pure segmentation method, and a corrected segmentation method which takes into consideration the real curvature of the sagged conductors. The latter, and novel, approach is compared with the other options. Calculations presented in this work utilize magnetic vector potential as an analysis tool. 1...|$|R

2500|$|One of {{the design}} {{problems}} that confronted Wren {{was to create a}} landmark dome, tall enough to visually replace the lost tower of St Paul's, {{while at the same time}} appearing visually satisfying when viewed from inside the building. Wren planned a double-shelled dome, as at St Peter's Basilica. [...] His solution to the visual problem was to separate the heights of the inner and outer dome to a much greater extent than had been done by Michelangelo at St Peter's, drafting both as <b>catenary</b> <b>curves,</b> rather than as hemispheres. Between the inner and outer domes, Wren inserted a brick cone which supports both the timbers of the outer, lead covered dome and the weight of the ornate stone lantern that rises above it. Both the cone and the inner dome are 18 inches thick and are supported by wrought iron chains at intervals in the brick cone and around the cornice of the peristyle of the inner dome to prevent spreading and cracking.|$|R
50|$|Some {{problems}} {{do not involve}} time.
