40|$|Dielectrical {{isolation}} (DI) {{increases the}} possibilities of the silicon technologies. It opens the way to integrate into a state-of-the-art CMOS process <b>complementary</b> <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors,</b> power switches or sensors. The different approaches to realize <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors</b> for low power RF mixed-mode applications and for analog circuits will be reviewed. A few years ago, power electronics has been a domain of discrete power devices and driver circuits only. DI technologies with emphasis on high dose oxygen implantion (SIMOX) for smart power processes - the monolithic integration of CMOS and power switch - and possible applications are described. The integration of sensors and redout electronics on a single chip creates new applications due to small, "smart" and low cost systems. Electronic circuits benefit from silicon on insulator substrates by improving density, robustness and adding new device options. Some examples of sensor structures, smart sensors which rely on SIMOX will be shown...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper examines, for {{the first}} time, the effects of {{radiation}} on transmission lines implemented in a commercial SiGe heterojunction <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistor</b> (HBT) <b>bipolar</b> <b>complementary</b> metal oxide semiconductor (BiCMOS) technology. Two different types of mm-wave transmission lines were designed, fabricated, and measured up to 110 GHz, and irradiated with 63. 3 MeV pro-tons to fluences as high as 5 1013 p/cm 2. The results demonstrate that radiation-induced changes are minimal in such lines, making them potentially suitable for use in space-based SiGe monolithic mm-wave communications systems.

40|$|We {{will now}} examine {{in more detail}} the current {{feedback}} (CFB) op amp topology which is very popular in high speed op amps. As mentioned previously, the circuit concepts were introduced decades ago, however modern high speed <b>complementary</b> <b>bipolar</b> processes {{are required to take}} full advantage of the architecture. It has long been known that in <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistor</b> circuits, currents can be switched faster than voltages, other things being equal. This forms the basis of non-saturating emitter-coupled logic (ECL) and devices such as current-output DACs. Maintaining low impedances at the current switching nodes helps to minimize the effects of stray capacitance, one of the largest detriments to high speed operation. The current mirror is a good example of how currents can be switched with a minimum amount of delay. +V...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 This thesis {{deals with}} 1 /f noise in p-MOS, bipolar, and lateral <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors.</b> Experimental {{measurements}} determine the appropriate 1 /f noise for MOSFET's, <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors</b> and lateral <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors.</b> The literature on 1 /f noise in p-MOSFETs, <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors</b> and lateral <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors</b> is reviewed. The two {{main sources of}} low frequency 1 /f noise are mobility fluctuations and number fluctuations. Our 1 /f noise measurements in p-MOSFET's, <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors,</b> and lateral pnp <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors</b> were done at frequencies of 1 Hz and 1 KHz respectively by both the automatic and analog methods. The measurement {{results suggest that the}} number fluctuation and mobility fluctuation models are applied for short channel and long channel p-MOSFET's in the saturation region respectively. Simulations have been done using PSPICE, with noise level NLEV= 0 and device model level 3 for long channel p-MOSFET's; with noise level NLEV= 2 and device model level 6 for short channel p-MOSFET's. Theoretical considerations as well as experimental results show {{that it is possible to}} take advantage of MOSFET and bipolar devices for low noise integrated circuit applications. Research on low frequency 1 /f noise in the different semiconductor devices is very important to determine the best semiconductor structure and best noise model for different devices.
