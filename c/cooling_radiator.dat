50|$|The Meredith {{effect is}} a {{phenomenon}} whereby the aerodynamic drag produced by a <b>cooling</b> <b>radiator</b> may be offset by careful design of the cooling duct such that useful thrust is produced.

50|$|The RK-I {{fuselage}} was of light-alloy semi-monocoque construction with {{a conventional}} tail unit. The retractable tail-wheel undercarriage {{was attached to}} the fuselage, giving the aircraft a very narrow track, retracting into the fuselage and covered by doors.

5000|$|The XP-54 was {{designed}} with a pusher engine in the aft {{part of the}} fuselage. The tail was mounted rearward between two mid-wing booms, with the 12-ft propeller between them. The design included a [...] "ducted wing section" [...] developed by the NACA that enabled installation of <b>cooling</b> <b>radiators</b> and intercoolers in the inverted gull wing.

50|$|The {{heat sink}} of a Stirling engine is {{typically}} the ambient air temperature. In {{the case of}} medium to high power Stirling engines, a radiator is generally required to transfer {{the heat from the}} engine to the ambient air. Stirling marine engines have the advantage of using the ambient temperature water. Placing the <b>cooling</b> <b>radiator</b> section in seawater rather than ambient air allows for the radiator to be smaller. The engine's cooling water may be used directly or indirectly for heating and cooling purposes of the ship. The Stirling engine has potential for surface-ship propulsion, as the engine's larger physical size is less of a concern.|$|E
50|$|The Rotax engine {{cylinder}} heads are liquid-cooled; there are cooling vanes on the cylinder barrels. Thus both cooling airflow through the nacelle, and a <b>cooling</b> <b>radiator,</b> are required in each cowl. The electric starters, used {{to start the}} engines on the ground, must {{also be used for}} an inflight restart, since the highly geared engines cannot be turned by airflow past the stopped propeller. Thus, for FAA certification, the company was required to add a backup battery in addition to the standard battery. The pilot's power quadrant contains three controls for each engine: throttle, propeller rpm, and carburetor heat. The engines have automatic mixture adjustment, so there is no mixture control required on the panel.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{requirement}} of a <b>cooling</b> <b>radiator</b> {{is that it}} shall dissipate heat; and for cooliug the engines of aircraft {{it is essential that}} the head resistance shalI be low. But both heat transfer and head resistance are greatly affected not only by the speed of air past the cooling surfaces, but by the character of the flow-whether the air passes through the radiator in smooth streams, or with eddies and vortices. If the flow is turbulent, the questions arise whether the turbulence can be increased by changes in construction, and if so whether the result is beneficial or harmful to the general performance of the radiator. This report presents experimental evidence bearing on the problem, and presents some conclusions based on that evidence.|$|E

5000|$|In January 1916, {{the company}} {{answered}} a War Department tender for military supply railways. The specification {{was for a}} [...] gauge locomotive, {{with no more than}} 1 ton of axle load per axle, capable of hauling up to 15 tons at 5 mph. The company designed a new locomotive, with outer longitudinal [...] "bent-rail" [...] frame, mounted on two driven axles. The 2JO petrol engine manufactured by W.H.Dorman & Co of Stafford was centre-set in the frame along with its Dixon-Abbott patent gearbox, which drove the unsprung axles through a chain-drive. At one end of the frame the operator sat facing to one side allowing him to drive equally well in either direction, and at the other end was the silencer and the water <b>cooling</b> <b>radiator</b> mounted with fan to provide transverse air flow. A large flywheel gave relatively smooth operation.|$|E
50|$|Circulating {{refrigerant}} gas vapor (which also carries the compressor lubricant oil across the system along with it) from the evaporator enters the gas compressor {{in the engine}} bay and is compressed to a higher pressure, resulting in a higher temperature as well. The hot, compressed refrigerant vapor is now at a temperature and pressure at which it can be condensed and is routed through a condenser, usually {{in front of the}} car's radiator. Here the refrigerant is cooled by air flowing across the condenser coils (originating from the vehicle's movement or from a fan, often the same fan of the <b>cooling</b> <b>radiator</b> if the condenser is mounted on it, automatically turned on when the vehicle is stationary or moving at low speeds) and condensed into a liquid. Thus, the circulating refrigerant rejects heat from the system and the heat is carried away by the air.|$|E
5000|$|The Hotchkiss {{was based}} on a design by Captain Baron Adolf Odkolek von Ujezda of Vienna. The patents had been {{purchased}} in 1893 by the firm of Benjamin Hotchkiss, based in Saint-Denis, near Paris. Benjamin Hotchkiss was no longer alive {{at the time of the}} purchase, but the Odkolek design was further developed and greatly improved under the direction of American-born Laurence Vincent BenÃ©t (1863-1948) with the assistance of Henri Albert MerciÃ©. After trials that began in 1895, development issues were resolved leading to the initial purchase of the Hotchkiss gun by the French Military in 1897. In 1898 an export model was also offered for international sales by Hotchkiss. With some useful changes, such as the addition of five <b>cooling</b> <b>radiator</b> rings on the barrel, the same basic design led to the M1900, and later to the M1914 (with minor improvements that were added since 1908). In the meantime adoption of the St. Ã‰tienne Mle 1907 (a French government arsenal product [...] ) to equip the infantry went through in 1908. Nevertheless, Hotchkiss machine guns were also purchased by the French military for use in overseas colonies and by mountain troops in the Alps. By the 1916, during World War I, French line infantry, still equipped with the unsatisfactory Saint-Etienne, convinced General Petain that it needed the more reliable Hotchkiss. It got its wish and French infantry divisions became progressively outfitted with the Hotchkiss gun in late 1917 and early 1918.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Due {{to working}} in natural {{environment}} {{in a long}} term and dust deposited on the surface, air <b>cooling</b> <b>radiator</b> turns to a lower heat transfer rate, so that it leads to load limit operation for air cooling unit in summer. In allusion to indirect air <b>cooling</b> <b>radiator</b> with Heller System, high-pressure water jet technique is used and built-in cleaning device is designed to entirely solve above-mentioned problem. Cleaning device works automatically and realizes full cover cleaning. Cleaning-pressure is between 100 and 150 bar and cleaning target distance keeps within 200 mm. Dust on the surface of radiator can be entirely cleaned. Cleaning flow is 20 m 3 /h and the cleaning cost decreases greatly. Such device has been successfully tested and worked. Furthermore, it has been applied to the project with a system of 2 Ã— 600 MW supercritical indirect air cooling unit...|$|E
