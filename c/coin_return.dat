500|$|The first silver dollars {{were struck}} on October 15, 1794. The silver {{used for the}} 1794 dollars came solely from silver ingots {{deposited}} with the Mint by Mint Director David Rittenhouse on August 22, 1794. [...] Per a handwritten coin transfer warrant issued by Director Rittenhouse on October 15, 1794, 1,758 silver dollars were transferred from the custody of Chief Coiner Henry Voigt to the custody of Mint Treasurer Dr. Nicholas Way. [...] Also on October 15th, per a handwritten <b>coin</b> <b>return</b> warrant issued by Director Rittenhouse, the 1,758 silver dollars were transferred from the custody of Mint Treasurer Dr. Nicholas Way to David Rittenhouse, as a partial <b>coin</b> <b>return</b> towards his August 22nd silver deposits. The 1,758 coins that were struck by Chief Coiner Henry Voigt, though acceptable, were poorly struck due to issues with the coining press that was used during early production at the Mint. [...] It was a man-powered screw press intended for use on coins {{no larger than a}} half dollar.|$|E

50|$|Nortel Centurion {{were made}} in the 1970s-1980s and used coins only. They came in black, brown, or green cases. Initial units used a rotary dial system and later units were touch tone key pad. Coin slot {{accepted}} denominations of 5, 10 and 25 cents. Centurions had a <b>coin</b> <b>return</b> button.|$|E
50|$|The {{gold was}} {{gradually}} sold in America - partly {{to fund the}} government in exile. Ten tons of gold <b>coins</b> <b>returned</b> to Norway in 1987.|$|R
50|$|After a {{long period}} of no minting, the <b>coin</b> <b>returned</b> in 1935 and 1936 with King George V of the United Kingdom on its obverse. The dimnesons {{remained}} the same although the coin's composition was changed to copper-nickel.|$|R
50|$|The dollar <b>coin</b> <b>returned</b> in 1999, {{in a case}} {{very similar}} to the 1921 Morgan dollar, with the Susan B. Anthony dollar, to fill in until the Sacagawea Dollar came about in 2000. Concurrent is the Presidential Dollar series, which, as of March 2016, is set to end in fall 2016.|$|R
5000|$|An early {{predecessor}} of {{the green}} box with similar usage was the [...] "payphone diode" [...] or [...] "one-armed bandit". This was a cheap silicon low-power diode that was bridged across two signal wires into the phone (polarity selected so that the diode is normally reverse-biased, otherwise it would permanently short the line). This device exploited another weakness in the ACTS on certain phone models (including 3 slot rotary). These models used an electromechanical diverter flap to drop and direct coins from the holding area to either the coin vault or the <b>coin</b> <b>return,</b> based on a signal from the CO. The default position of this flap was to the <b>coin</b> <b>return</b> so no signal was required for incomplete calls. The diode allowed the coin drop on the Collect ACTS signal but kept the flap in the default position.|$|E
50|$|Several {{elevators}} are locked, {{requiring the}} player to find keys. These are {{hidden in the}} <b>coin</b> <b>return</b> slot of the various phones that hang on the wall. Certain other phones contain a digit, three of which are required for a digital lock near the top floor. However, the player must listen carefully to the phone ringing; searching a wrong phone causes a Noid (on {{the other end of}} the line) to blow up the phone, destroying your pizza once more. Ironically, one of the topmost phones in the building contains two bonus pizzas.|$|E
5000|$|Joseph John O'Connell, 1st, was an {{electrical}} engineer and inventor. He worked for the Chicago Telephone Company (which began as the Chicago Bell Telephone, Co. in 1878 [...] ) in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He had many inventions including the circuit breaker and the <b>coin</b> <b>return.</b> He also created the [...] "invisible wire" [...] {{which was the first}} time more than one telephone conversation could occur on the same wire. Reference to some additional inventions are mentioned in Angus Hibbard's autobiography, Hello- Goodbye [...] including an electric lamp as a signal in a burglar-alarm operated by the telephone company in 1886.|$|E
50|$|He had a {{very quick}} wit which he used with his sleight of hand. He used both in a trick called the Boomerang Coins. He counts about twenty coins onto a tray and the coins are poured in the spectator’s hands. Five of the coins are given back to Tobias who vanishes them. The <b>coins</b> <b>return</b> to {{the hand of the}} spectator.|$|R
50|$|Over 300 actors {{from all}} over the United States and some foreign {{countries}} submitted for the various roles. After three rounds of auditions, 35 were cast in speaking roles for a total of 120 actors including the various background performers. Vernon Aldershoff and Robin Ann Rapoport reprised their roles as Henri and Margret Miller from the short film version with Toula <b>Coin</b> <b>returning</b> as the reporter.|$|R
50|$|Six teams {{compete against}} each other in a tournament. Each episode, two teams face each other in a battle to see who is the strongest and toughest team. The {{challenges}} are based on toughness, fear and speed. In each season, the teams play three times each; with the two teams which have the most gold <b>coins</b> <b>returning</b> for the final round of the tournament at the series' finale.|$|R
50|$|Coin slots, coin {{returns and}} the coin box, which {{allow for the}} {{exchange}} of money or tokens. They are usually below the control panel. Very often, translucent red plastic buttons are placed in between the <b>coin</b> <b>return</b> and the coin slot. When they are pressed, a coin or token that has become jammed in the coin mechanism is returned to the player. See coin acceptor. Early coin slots could be defeated using a piezo-electric gas fire or gas oven igniter held against the steel bodywork of the cabinet, thus enabling free credits to be obtained. In some arcades, the coin slot is replaced with a card reader that reads data from a game card bought from the arcade operator.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the scene}} of Station QTTV, Daffy has Bugs at gunpoint {{when they see a}} parade of prizes coming out of a studio (car, boat, fur coat, refrigerator, [...] "Key to Fort Knox", etc.), and they see people going into the show [...] "People Are Phoney" [...] {{starring}} Art Lamplighter. With dollar signs in his eyes, Daffy locks Bugs in a telephone booth and runs into the studio. Bugs receives a call in the telephone booth from an announcer who tells Bugs if he correctly answers a question, he will win a jackpot. Bugs answers the math question and the jackpot dispenses through the <b>coin</b> <b>return</b> slot. The announcer then asks Bugs how he knew the answer so quickly. Bugs says, [...] "One thing we rabbits know how to do is multiply." ...|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, Little Red Riding Hood {{is walking}} through the forest with a basket of goodies for her Grandma. She {{opens the door and}} calls to her grandmother, but she discovers that there is a note pinned to her pillow. The note reads, [...] "Dear Red: Got tired of waiting. Have gone to Three Bears' house to eat up Little Goldilocks. Love, the Wolf". Red {{immediately}} goes to the telephone and starts dialing. As sleepy little Golilocks (presumably from eating 3 big bowls of porridge) is climbing the stairs, the phone rings. She runs back down stairs and answers the phone. It's Red calling to warn her about the Wolf. She passes the note to Goldilocks over the split frame and as she finishes reading the note, she shakes Red's hand and says, [...] "Gee, thanks a lot! See ya later!" [...] hangs up the phone and checks the phone's <b>coin</b> <b>return</b> slot for any loose change.|$|E
5000|$|In another variant, if a tossed coin {{comes to}} rest on {{any part of the}} coin closest to the wall(the leading coin before the toss),the player whose coin is on top, {{at the end of the}} game, is {{declared}} the winner even if the coin is further from the wall that the coin below. However, should another player toss a coin closer to the wall, than either of the stacked coins, that tossed coin then becomes the leading coin. In cases where two coins land on the leading coin, the closet upper coin to the wall wins (even if the coin below is closer to the wall). Under the same conditions, other games state that the owner of the upper coin collects only the coin below, but all other players get their <b>coins</b> <b>returned</b> to them. In this case, it leaves the owner of the lower coin, who was closest to the wall and once leading, the only player that does not get their <b>coin</b> <b>returned.</b> A case of, [...] "so close, yet so far" [...] In other games, under the same conditions (a coin coming {{to rest on}} top of the leading coin), the game is considered null and void, and each player picks up the coin they tossed. In all forms of the game, when no clear winner is determined, in cases where two or more coins are equally close to the wall and particularly when all are touching the wall, some rules declare the game null and void and all players have their <b>coins</b> <b>returned</b> to them, while other games state that the owners of the tied coins win and divide the remaining coins between them. Clearly, the last rule mentioned can create difficulties if the winnings are not divisible by whole coins. Therefore, generally, the rule is seldom played. Rules are established before any game begins.|$|R

50|$|After the Manchu {{conquest of}} the Dzungar Khanate pūl coins were offered by the Qing {{government}} to be exchanged for ”Red Cash” {{at a ratio of}} 2 pūl for 1 cash, but after 1762 the exchange was altered to 1:1. Under the Qing dynasty pūl coins continued to be produced until 1745, and the Manchus stopped pulling them out of circulation to cast “Red Cash” in 1768. Small amounts of pūl <b>coins</b> <b>returned</b> to the market during the Dungan Revolt (1862-77).|$|R
50|$|Besides being {{illegal for}} several reasons, {{access to the}} lines on payphones is usually limited by conduit or armor, but only for the first few, usually six to ten, feet. Payphones {{modified}} with discrete jumper wires for diodes to be clipped on were very popular in the early 1970s. Contrary to the green box, the diode allowed control from the calling payphone. A modified phone with a poor quality diode could be quickly identified by the constant clicking sound produced by the <b>coin</b> <b>return</b> mechanism. The single payphone at Canadian Village (also known as Lake Shore) located {{on the road to}} the marina of Huntington Lake in California was well known for this issue. Children would gather in the area to collect coins after a caller left, often to buy candy at the store across the road. Operation required using actual coins and lengthy long distance calls with mid-call Collect signals required deft manipulation of the noisy coins falling to the return, usually by covering the microphone with the hand or simply turning ones back to the phone.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the changes in gold price and modeling of its return volatility and conditional variance model. The study gathers daily prices of gold coins as the dependent variable and the price of gold in world market, the price of oil in OPEC, exchange rate USD to IRR and index of Tehran Stock Exchange from March 2007 to July 2013 and using ARCH family models and VAR methods, the study analysis the data. The study first examines whether the data are stationary or not and then it reviews the household stability, Arch and Garch models. The proposed study investigates the causality among variables, selects different factors, which could be blamed of uncertainty in the <b>coin</b> <b>return.</b> The results indicate that the effect of sudden changes of standard deviation and after a 14 -day period disappears and gold price goes back to its initial position. In addition, in this study we observe the so-called leverage effect in Iran’s Gold coin market, which means the good news leads to more volatility in futures market than bad news in an equal size. Finally, the result of analysis of variance implies that in the short-term, a large percentage change in uncertainty of the <b>coin</b> <b>return</b> is due to changes in the same factors and volatility of stock returns in the medium term, global gold output, oil price and exchange rate fluctuation to some extent will show the impact. In the long run, the effects of parameters are more evident...|$|E

50|$|<b>Coin</b> <b>returns</b> the University and Ankh-Morpork to the {{way they}} were before he came. After Conina and Nijel travel to the University looking for Rincewind, Coin uses his magic to make them forget him and live happily ever after together. Recognising that he is too {{powerful}} to remain in the world, Coin steps into a dimension of his own making, and is not seen on the Discworld again. The Librarian takes Rincewind's battered hat, which got left behind when he went into the Dungeon Dimensions, and places it on a pedestal inside the Library.|$|R
5000|$|After {{retiring}} from racing, Norton's <b>Coin</b> <b>returned</b> to Griffiths' farm in Wales {{and was never}} ridden again reportedly enjoying his life of leisure and remaining in excellent health {{until the age of}} 19. On the morning of 15 January Griffiths turned the horse out into the field and returned to find that the horse had collapsed and died, probably from a heart attack. Griffiths commented; [...] "He was one of the family, but we can't do much about it. It's a pity we can't all go the same way instead of suffering goodness knows what".|$|R

50|$|Third party coin {{certification}} was {{pioneered by}} ANACS, {{which was founded}} by the American Numismatic Association (ANA) in 1972. The Board of Governors realized {{the need to have}} a guarantee of authenticity, so they offered the first authentication service. At that time, the coins were not graded, only confirmed as genuine. <b>Coins</b> were <b>returned</b> with a photo certificate but not encapsulated.|$|R

In April 2015, a United States federal appeals court ordered the <b>coins</b> <b>returned</b> to the Langbord family because the original asset seizure was conducted improperly, as the government failed to file a judicial civil forfeiture complaint within 90 days of the family's seized asset claim. This order was reversed on July 28, 2015, and in October 2015, an en banc session was held with 13 judges from the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, where they heard oral arguments in the ongoing appeal. On August 1, 2016, the judges reversed the previous ruling, finding the coins to be property of the United States government. The Langbords appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which on April 17, 2017 denied certiorari.|$|R
