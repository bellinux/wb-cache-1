The edge smoothness is determined by the shape of the <b>cutting</b> <b>die</b> and the amount the cuts overlap; naturally the more the cuts overlap, the cleaner the edge.

50|$|Knife is the <b>cutting</b> <b>die</b> for {{envelope}} or wrapper blanks. It {{is called}} a knife rather than a die because the latter is an object that makes an embossed printed impression of the stamp or indicium on the envelope. Traditionally, a knife would normally be made of forged steel. It was placed on a stack of paper with the sharp edge against the paper. The press head forced the cutting edge {{all the way through}} the stack of paper. The cut blanks were removed from the knife and the process repeated. Not only could it cut out the odd shape of an envelope, but a knife could be used to cut out shapes of airmail stickers or gummed labels in the shape of stars or circles. The variety of shapes a knife could cut would be infinite.|$|E

An experimental setup was built integrating an ultrasonic elliptical vibration mechanism with a jet lubrication device on a 4 -axis ultra-precision lathe. The frequency of ultrasonic elliptical vibration is 38. 36 kHz with a trajectory of 8. 5 × 3. 5 µm. Graphite particles with sizes of 1. 3 ~ 2 µm were selected. Conventional cutting and the combined method were conducted on die steel.

It is also used extensively in the automotive industry for applications such as part inspections, scanning of tools without CAD definition, scanning the casting for definition of the stock (i. e. the amount of material to be removed from the surface of the castings) model for CAM programs and reverse engineering.

A laser beam is used to melt a controlled amount of injected powder on a base plate to deposit the first layer and on previous passes for the subsequent layers. As opposed to conventional machining processes, this computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) technology builds complete functional parts or features on an existing component by adding instead of removing material. In this paper, laser consolidation of CPM- 9 V tool steel will be described to produce cutting blades on low alloy steel base to manufacture rotary <b>cutting</b> <b>dies.</b> The laser consolidated (LC) CPM- 9 V cutting blades, {{as well as the}} bond between the LC blades and the base, are metallurgically sound, free of cracks or porosity.
