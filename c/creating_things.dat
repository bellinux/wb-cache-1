Within the month, he fulfilled his contractual obligation to EMI/Capitol for one more album by releasing Shaved Fish, a compilation album of previously recorded tracks. He devoted himself to Sean, rising at 6am daily to plan and prepare his meals and to spend time with him. He wrote [...] "Cookin' (In the Kitchen of Love)" [...] for Starr's Ringo's Rotogravure (1976), performing on the track in June in what would be his last recording session until 1980.

They saw, took and sacrificed with this Chaturvimsatiratra, and in consequence overcame want, misery and death, and reached the divine assembly." [...] In the same Veda we are told that the gods and Asuras contended together; the gods were less numerous, but, as politicians make men peers, they added to their number by placing some bricks in the proper position to receive the sacrificial fire. They then used incantations: [...] "Thou art a multiplier"; and so the bricks became animated, and joined the party of the gods, and made numbers more equal.** ...|$|E
