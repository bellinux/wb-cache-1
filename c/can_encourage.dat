5|$|Soon {{after the}} game opens, the player learns that Kendall and Charlotte have just broken up out of a lesbian relationship, while a few weeks prior Taylor and Nolan had broken up out of a {{heterosexual}} relationship. Arianna develops a crush on the teacher, which in the player's first decision point Rook can reciprocate or not. Akira soon comes out as gay, finding to his dismay that everyone else already knew. He then attempts {{to enter into a}} relationship with Nolan, who is unsure how to respond; Rook <b>can</b> <b>encourage</b> him to try it out or let him decide on his own, but he enters a relationship with Akira regardless.|$|E
5|$|Although the U.S. {{administration}} has denied that devaluing their currency {{was part of}} their objectives for implementing quantitative easing, the practice can act to devalue a country's currency in two indirect ways. Firstly, it <b>can</b> <b>encourage</b> speculators to bet that the currency will decline in value. Secondly, the large increase in the domestic money supply will lower domestic interest rates, often they will become much lower than interest rates in countries not practising quantitative easing. This creates the conditions for a carry trade, where market participants can engage in a form of arbitrage, borrowing in the currency of the country practising quantitative easing, and lending {{in a country with}} a relatively high rate of interest. Because they are effectively selling the currency being used for quantitative easing on the international markets, this can increase the supply of the currency and hence push down its value. By October 2010 expectations in the markets were high that the United States, UK, and Japan would soon embark on a second round of QE, with the prospects for the Eurozone to join them less certain.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes {{the text}} {{can give a}} basic outline that {{correlates}} to the four-movement scheme of a symphony. For instance, the four-part structure of Edgar Allan Poe's The Bells, a progression from youth to marriage, maturity, and death, naturally suggested the four movements of a symphony to Sergei Rachmaninoff, which he followed in his choral symphony of the same name. The text <b>can</b> <b>encourage</b> a composer to expand a choral symphony past the normal bounds of the symphonic genre, as with Berlioz for his Roméo et Juliette, yet stay within the basic structural or aesthetic intent of symphonic form. It can also influence the musical content in parts {{where there is no}} singing, as in Roméo et Juliette. There, Berlioz allows the orchestra to express the majority of the drama in instrumental music and saves words for expository and narrative sections of the work.|$|E
5|$|The {{barn owl}} has acute hearing, with ears placed asymmetrically. This {{improves}} detection of sound position and distance {{and the bird}} does not require sight to hunt. The facial disc plays a part in this process, as is shown {{by the fact that}} with the ruff feathers removed, the bird can still locate the source in azimuth but fails to do so in elevation. Hunting nocturnally or crepuscularly, this bird can target its prey and dive to the ground, penetrating its talons through snow, grass or brush to seize small creatures with deadly accuracy. Compared to other owls of similar size, the barn owl has a much higher metabolic rate, requiring relatively more food. Weight for weight, barn owls consume more rodents—often regarded as pests by humans—than possibly any other creature. This makes the barn owl one of the most economically valuable wildlife animals for agriculture. Farmers often find these owls more effective than poison in keeping down rodent pests, and they <b>can</b> <b>encourage</b> barn owl habitation by providing nest sites.|$|E

In the event of a tie (i.e. all wickets down in the last innings with the scores being equal) each side was awarded 7 points.|$|E
25|$|The {{findings}} of Mark Levine and Simon Crowther (2008) illustrated that increasing group size inhibited intervention in a street violence scenario when bystanders were strangers, but encouraged intervention when bystanders were friends. They {{also found that}} when gender identity is salient, group size encouraged intervention when bystanders and victims shared social category membership. In addition, group size interacted with context-specific norms that both inhibit and encourage helping. The bystander effect is not a generic consequence of increasing group size. When bystanders share group-level psychological relationships, group size <b>can</b> <b>encourage</b> as well as inhibit helping.|$|E
25|$|Vinegar (3–10% aqueous acetic acid) {{may be used}} as {{a common}} remedy to help with box {{jellyfish}} stings, but not the stings of the Portuguese man o' war (which is not a true jellyfish, but a siphonophore).

Salt water {{may be used as}} an alternative if vinegar is unavailable; and may be preferred over vinegar. Fresh water is not usually used if the sting occurs in salt water, as changes in tonicity can release additional venom. Rubbing wounds, or using alcohol, spirits, ammonia, or urine may have strongly negative effects as these <b>can</b> <b>encourage</b> the release of venom.|$|E

25|$|Public waste {{containers}} or street bins {{are provided}} by local authorities {{to be used as}} a convenient place for the disposal and collection of litter. Increasingly both general waste and recycling options are provided. Local councils pick the waste up and take it to reuse or recycling. However, there are issues with this approach. If the bins are not regularly emptied, then overfilling of bins occurs and can increase litter indirectly. Some local authorities will only take responsibility for rubbish that is placed in the bins, which means that litter remains a problem. People may blame a lack of well-placed bins for their littering. Hazardous materials may be incorrectly disposed of in the bins and they <b>can</b> <b>encourage</b> dumpster diving.|$|E
25|$|Mikulincer, Shaver, and Pereg contend these {{strategies}} of regulating attachment anxiety {{have very different}} consequences. The security-based strategy leads to more positive thoughts, such as more positive explanations of why others behave {{in a particular way}} and more positive memories about people and events. More positive thoughts <b>can</b> <b>encourage</b> more creative responses to difficult problems or distressing situations. The hyperactivation and attachment avoidance strategies lead to more negative thoughts and less creativity in handling problems and stressful situations. It is notable that the security-based strategy is contingent on a positive response from their attachment. From this perspective, it would benefit people to have attachments who are willing and able to respond positively to the person's request for closeness, so that they can use security-based strategies for dealing with their anxiety.|$|E
25|$|Prosecutors say {{it sends}} a message {{that no one is}} above the law, and the {{likelihood}} of being perp-walked after arrest deters criminal behavior on the part of offenders, especially white-collar criminals, who might otherwise believe they could successfully avoid conviction. Mary Jo White, former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the federal prosecutor's office that handles most crimes committed in the financial sector, believes perp walks in such cases restore investor confidence. Police say that the image of a suspect being taken into custody, when publicized, <b>can</b> <b>encourage</b> other witnesses to come forward with relevant information. Lastly, prosecutors may be trying to get an advantage in a bail hearing if they consider the defendant to be a flight risk, since it bolsters their case if the defendant apparently had to be arrested.|$|E
