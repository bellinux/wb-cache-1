25|$|A {{well-known}} <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of the 10th-century AD ship {{burial of}} the Rus' described by Ibn Fadlan. Here, when a female slave {{had said she}} {{would be willing to}} die, her body was subsequently burned with her master on the pyre.|$|E
25|$|One {{interpretation}} of the Jeffries <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> while a university cannot fire a professor for opinions and speech, they have more flexibility with a position like department chair. Another {{is that it allows}} public institutions to discipline employees in general for disruptive speech.|$|E
25|$|The extreme <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of a double-headed coin {{that never}} comes up tails, or a double-tailed coin that never {{results in a}} head. Then there is no uncertainty. The entropy is zero: each toss of the coin {{delivers}} no new information as the outcome of each coin toss is always certain.|$|E
50|$|A notable <b>case</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of Gero, Count of Alsleben, whose {{daughter}} married Siegfried II, Count of Stade.|$|R
60|$|This is a rule; {{so there}} must be an {{exception}} to prove it. Moriarty's <b>case</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> exception.|$|R
25|$|The {{opinion in}} this <b>case</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> mere {{damage to a}} chattel {{was not a good}} claim in trover.|$|R
25|$|A special <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of El Colegio Nacional, {{created during}} the district's {{governmental}} period of Miguel Alemán Valdés to have, in Mexico, an institution {{similar to the}} College of France. The select and privileged group of Mexican scientists and artists belonging to this institution—membership is for life—include, among many, Mario Lavista, Ruy Pérez Tamayo, José Emilio Pacheco, Marcos Moshinsky (d.2009), Guillermo Soberón Acevedo. Members are obligated to publicly disclose their works through conferences and public events such as concerts and recitals.|$|E
25|$|Another {{model that}} has been put forth is the incentive-motivation model. The model {{explains}} that the desire for sex comes from an interaction between a sensitive sexual response system and stimuli that {{are present in the}} environment. Researchers argue that this model supports the idea that sexual desire is not spontaneous. Furthermore, this model implies that the case is not that one has sex because one feels sexual desire; rather, the <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> one feels sexual desire because one has sex.|$|E
25|$|The Horn {{remains a}} major hazard for {{recreational}} sailors, however. A classic <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of Miles and Beryl Smeeton, {{who attempted to}} round the Horn in their yacht Tzu Hang. Hit by a rogue wave when approaching the Horn, the boat pitchpoled (i.e. somersaulted end-over-end). Although they survived, {{and were able to}} make repairs in Talcahuano, Chile, they attempted the passage again, only to be rolled over, and dismasted for a second time, by another rogue wave, which again they miraculously survived.|$|E
50|$|The second <b>case</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of 17-year-old Sohanne Benziane who {{was burned}} alive by an alleged small-time gang leader.|$|R
50|$|The {{significance}} of this <b>case</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> groups like Sikhs and Jews could now be protected under the Race Relations Act 1976.|$|R
50|$|The {{prevailing}} academic view (for {{which there}} is some support in the <b>cases)</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> mistake can <b>be</b> a ground of restitution for services.|$|R
25|$|Some {{symptoms}} of amnesia {{have been shown}} to be alleviated through various interactions with music, including playing and listening. One such <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of Clive Wearing, whose severe retrograde and anterograde amnesia have been detailed in the documentaries Prisoner of Consciousness and The Man with the 7 Second Memory. Though unable to recall past memories or form new ones, Wearing is still able to play, conduct, and sing along with music learned prior to the onset of his amnesia, and even add improvisations and flourishes.|$|E
25|$|Hardcastle tells Mrs Rival {{that her}} {{description}} of the deceased is not accurate. Upset, she calls the person who involved her in this case. Despite police watching her, she is found dead at Victoria tube station, stabbed in the back. Poirot's initial view of this <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the appearance of complexity must conceal quite a simple murder. The clocks are a red herring, as {{is the presence of}} Sheila, and the removal of the dead man's wallet and tailor marks in the clothing. Colin updates Poirot on succeeding visits.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{remaining}} art of Bactria was destroyed from the 5th century onward: the Buddhists were often blamed for idolatry and tended to be persecuted by the iconoclastic Muslims. Destructions continued during the Afghanistan War, and especially by the Taliban regime in 2001. The most famous <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{of the destruction of}} the Buddhas of Bamyan. Ironically, most of {{the remaining}} art from Afghanistan still extant was removed from the country during the Colonial period. In particular, a rich collection exists at the Musee Guimet in France.|$|E
30|$|The {{learning}} {{points from}} this <b>case</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> cardiac MRI <b>is</b> {{a very useful}} tool for further evaluation of suspected cardiac masses and should be performed for further characterization.|$|R
50|$|Among his <b>cases</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of Richard Paul Pavlick, a would-be-assassin {{stalking}} President John F. Kennedy. Choate ruled <b>that</b> Pavlick <b>was</b> {{mentally ill}} {{and had him}} confined to a mental hospital.|$|R
50|$|One {{major impact}} of these <b>cases</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{commerce}} may <b>be</b> exceptionally impacted. Sensitive business information, academic materials for conferences, {{and other types of}} valuable information may be delayed by these practices.|$|R
25|$|The {{legal action}} brought by investors against the Government {{started in the}} Royal Courts of Justice on 13 January 2009. Shareholders were also staging a {{demonstration}} outside the court. One {{of the points that}} was revealed about the <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they were examining who 'leaked' the information about the bank receiving its emergency government bailout. In order to give full consideration, Lord Justice Stanley Burnton and Mr Justice Silber reserved their decision, before they gave a written judgment of the case. On 13 February it was announced that the shareholders had lost the case. Roger Lawson of the UK Shareholders Association said that there was a 'good chance' that they would appeal the decision.|$|E
25|$|We assume in {{accordance}} with that case that the corrective process supplied by the State may be so adequate that interference by habeas corpus {{ought not to be}} allowed. It certainly is true that mere mistakes of law {{in the course of a}} trial are not to be corrected in that way. But if the <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the whole proceeding is a mask—that counsel, jury and judge were swept to the fatal end by an irresistible wave of public passion, and that the State Courts failed to correct the wrong, neither perfection in the machinery for correction nor the possibility that the trial court and counsel saw no other way of avoiding an immediate outbreak of the mob can prevent this Court from securing to the petitioners their constitutional rights.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{instances of}} chicanery, {{the appeal of}} spiritualism was strong. Prominent {{in the ranks of}} its adherents were those grieving the death of a loved one. Many families {{during the time of the}} American Civil War had seen their men go off and never return, and images of the battlefield, produced through the new medium of photography, demonstrated that their loved ones had not only died in overwhelmingly huge numbers, but horribly as well. One well known <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of Mary Todd Lincoln who, grieving the loss of her son, organized séances in the White House which were attended by her husband, President Abraham Lincoln. The surge of spiritualism during this time, and later during World War I, was a direct response to those massive battlefield casualties.|$|E
50|$|The {{requirement}} <b>that</b> {{there must}} <b>be</b> no possible alternative {{is particularly true}} when racial or ethnic tension {{is the cause of}} the incompatibility. The test in such <b>cases</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of necessity.|$|R
50|$|Among the {{findings}} of the tribunal hearing the <b>case</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> physically impossible for Kopyto to have billed the sums he did as the times billed exceeded the hours in the day.|$|R
50|$|Bushel {{petitioned the}} Court of Common Pleas for a writ of habeas corpus. The ruling in the Bushels <b>Case</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> a jury {{could not be}} punished simply {{on account of the}} verdict it returned.|$|R
25|$|The first episcopal {{assistant}} of the vicar {{known is}} Angelus de Tineosis, Episcopus Viterbiensis, named 2 October 1321, as {{assistant to the}} Vicar Andreas, Episcopus Terracinensis. His position is not so well outlined in the documents that we can form {{a clear idea of}} his duties. It is significant that Angelus officiated as assistant even when the Vicar Andreas was in the city. On the other hand, the Vicar Franciscus Scaccani, Episcopus Nolanus, was allowed to choose an assistant for the business of the vicariate only in the case of his own absence from Rome. According to this document it was not for the pope but the vicar himself, though authorized thereto by the pope, who chose his own assistant and gave over to him all his authority or faculties, insofar as they were based on law or custom. This shows that the vicarius urbis was firmly established in the fulness of his office and externally recognized as such; certain consuetudinary rights had even at this date grown up and become accepted. We see from the Bullarium Magnum (II, 75) that on 18 October 1412, Pope John XXII nominated Petrus Saccus, a canon of St. Peter's, as locum tenens of the Vicar Franciscus, abbas monasterii S. Martini in Monte Cimino O.S.B., and himself conferred on this official all the faculties of the vicar. The new locum tenens was bidden to take the usual oath before the Apostolic Camera (see above). A similar <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> (1430) of Lucas de Ilpernis, another canon of St. Peter's. When Petrus Accolti, Bishop-elect of Ancona, was named vicarius urbis in 1505, he took over the jurisdiction, but the pontificalia or ceremonial rights were given to Franciscus Berthleay, Bishop of Mylopotamos, until the consecration of Accolti. A similar <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of Andreas Jacobazzi, a canon of St. Peter's, named vicar in 1519, but not consecrated as Bishop of Lucera until 1520; the pontificalia were committed to Vincentius, Bishop of Ottochaz-Zengg.|$|E
25|$|A related <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of a {{woman whose}} husband has died childless: in such a situation, the husband's brother is {{required}} by Jewish law {{to enter into a}} levirate marriage with the widow so as to have children with her {{in the name of the}} deceased. The brother can refuse to do yibbum and instead perform a ceremony known as chalitza to release her from her bond to him (in modern times chalitza is nearly always performed instead of yibbum). If the brother is missing, or if he is still a child, the woman is required to wait until he is located or has reached adolescence so that he can perform the chalitza ceremony. There have been recorded cases of the husband's brother trying to blackmail the widow by delaying the chalitza ceremony, effectively leaving her as an agunah.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason of}} the {{interest}} for Diophantine equations, in the elliptic curve <b>case,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> K may not be algebraically closed. There can exist curves C that have no point defined over K, and which become isomorphic over a larger field to E, which by definition has a point over K to serve as identity element for its addition law. That is, for this case we should distinguish C that have genus 1, from elliptic curves E that have a K-point (or, in other words, provide a Diophantine equation that has a solution in K). The curves C {{turn out to be}} torsors over E, and form a set carrying a rich structure in the case that K is a number field (the theory of the Selmer group). In fact a typical plane cubic curve C over Q has no particular reason to have a rational point; the standard Weierstrass model always does, namely the point at infinity, but you need a point over K to put C into that form over K.|$|E
30|$|<b>Case</b> one <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the first}} touch was truly {{intended}} {{and the second}} touch <b>was</b> unintended. <b>Case</b> two <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the first touch was unintended and the second touch <b>was</b> intended. And <b>case</b> three <b>is</b> <b>that</b> both the first touch and the second touch were unintended. In both case two and three, the unintended drawn ink stroke should be removed. Therefore, to minimize the occurrences of IDIR, we embed a function that invokes DIR only for the first touch.|$|R
50|$|The oddity in this <b>case</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> this <b>case</b> <b>was</b> {{filed in}} the last three days before Urban Bank {{declared}} a bank holiday, as they believed this was filed due to their accusation that the Bangko Sentral did not provide them sufficient financial assistance to curb the panic withdrawals.|$|R
5|$|Death {{caused by}} helium is rare. The first media-recorded <b>case</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of a 15-year-old girl from Texas {{who died in}} 1998 from helium {{inhalation}} at a friend's party; the exact type of helium death is unidentified.|$|R
25|$|During the 1990s, {{monuments to}} Antonescu were raised and streets were {{named after him}} in Bucharest and several other cities. Among those {{directly}} involved in this process were Iosif Constantin Drăgan, the nationalist Mayor of Cluj-Napoca, Gheorghe Funar, and General Mircea Chelaru, whose resignation from the Army was subsequently requested and obtained. Also during that interval, in 1993, filmmaker and Social Democratic politician Sergiu Nicolaescu produced Oglinda, which depicts Antonescu (played by Ion Siminie) apologetically. The rehabilitation trend was also represented at an October 1994 commemorative exhibit at the National Military Museum. The same year, a denialist documentary film, Destinul mareșalului ("The Marshal's Destiny"), was distributed by state-owned companies, a matter which raised concern. After the Wiesel Commission presented its findings and such public endorsement was outlawed, statues in Antonescu's likeness were torn down or otherwise made unavailable for public viewing. An unusual <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of his Saints Constantine and Helena Church, where, after lengthy debates, his bust was sealed inside a metal box. Outside of this context, the publicized display of Antonescu's portraits and racist slogans by football hooligans during Liga I's 2005–2006 season prompted UEFA intervention (see Racism Breaks the Game).|$|E
25|$|Another {{mechanism}} of facilitation is a reduced {{risk of being}} eaten. Nurse plants, for example, not only reduce abiotic stress, but may also physically impede herbivory of seedlings growing under them. In both terrestrial and marine environments, herbivory of palatable species is reduced when they occur with unpalatable species. These “associational refuges” may occur when unpalatable species physically shield the palatable species, or when herbivores are “confused” by the inhibitory cues of the unpalatable species. Herbivory can also reduce predation of the herbivore, {{as in the case}} of the red-ridged clinging crab (Mithrax forceps) along the North Carolina, USA, coastline. This crab species takes refuge in the branches of the compact Ivory Bush Coral (Oculina arbuscula) and feeds on seaweed in the vicinity of the coral. The reduced competition with seaweed enhances coral growth, which in turn provides more refuge for the crab. A similar <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of the interaction between swollen-thorn acacia trees (Acacia spp.) and certain ants (Pseudomyrmex spp.) in Central America. The acacia provides nourishment and protection (inside hollow thorns) to the ant in return for defense against herbivores. In contrast, a different type of facilitation between ants and sap-feeding insects may increase plant predation. By consuming sap, plant pests such as aphids produce a sugar-rich waste product called honeydew, which is consumed by ants in exchange for protection of the sap-feeders against predation.|$|E
500|$|An {{analogous}} <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of the screwball comedy, {{widely accepted}} by film historians as constituting a [...] "genre": the screwball is defined {{not by a}} fundamental attribute, but by a general disposition {{and a group of}} elements, some—but rarely and perhaps never all—of which are found in each of the genre's films. Because of the diversity of noir (much greater than that of the screwball comedy), certain scholars in the field, such as film historian Thomas Schatz, treat it as not a genre but a [...] "style". Alain Silver, the most widely published American critic specializing in film noir studies, refers to film noir as a [...] "cycle" [...] and a [...] "phenomenon", even as he argues that it has—like certain genres—a consistent set of visual and thematic codes. Other critics treat film noir as a [...] "mood", characterize it as a [...] "series", or simply address a chosen set of films they regard as belonging to the noir [...] "canon". There is no consensus on the matter.|$|E
50|$|The {{migration}} process {{between the two}} countries dates back to colonial times. Undoubtedly, a memorable <b>case</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of Chilean migration to Argentina after the Battle of Rancagua and the Spanish reconquest of Chile between 1814 and 1817.|$|R
50|$|The Scottish {{legal system}} permits {{compassionate}} release for terminal illness. There {{are only a}} few applications per year, and most are granted. A prominent <b>case</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, released on 20 August 2009 because of prostate cancer.|$|R
50|$|The {{prosecution}} <b>case</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{a section}} of CPI(M) leaders in Kozhikode and Kannur districts allegedly hatched a conspiracy and hired a seven-member gang to kill Chandrasekharan, who had {{walked out of the}} party and floated a dissident outfit at Onchiyam.|$|R
