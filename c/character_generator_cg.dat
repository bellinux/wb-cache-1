50|$|A {{broadcast}} designer is {{a person}} involved with creating graphic designs and electronic media incorporated in television productions that are used by <b>character</b> <b>generator</b> (<b>CG)</b> operators. A broadcast designer may have a degree in digital media (or a similar degree), or is self-taught in the software needed to create such content.|$|E

50|$|Systems Resources Corporation began {{manufacturing}} dot-matrix (5×7) <b>character</b> <b>generators</b> (<b>CG)</b> for airport {{arrival and}} departure time displays. It also began manufacturing a clean-looking fixed-font (ROM-based) CG sold as the Chiron I. It featured {{the ability to}} record and retrieve lower thirds and full page text displays for news departments of TV stations {{as an alternative to}} art cards, slides or scrolling black felt.|$|R
50|$|MOS was {{developed}} to {{reduce the need for}} the development of device specific drivers. By allowing developers to embed functionality and handle events, vendors were relieved of the burden of developing device drivers. It was left to the manufacturers to interface newsroom computer systems. This approach affords broadcasters flexibility to purchase equipment from multiple vendors. It also limits the need to have operators in multiple locations throughout the studio as, for example, multiple <b>character</b> <b>generators</b> (<b>CG)</b> can be fired from a single control workstation, without needing an operator at each CG console.|$|R
50|$|A {{graphics}} operator operates a <b>character</b> <b>generator</b> (<b>CG)</b> {{that produces the}} lower third on-screen titles and full-page digital on-screen graphics. The audio technician operates the audio mixing console. The technician {{is in charge of}} the microphones, music and audio tape. Often, production assistants operate the teleprompters and professional video cameras and serve as lighting and rigging technicians (grips).|$|E
50|$|A {{broadcast}} designer is {{a person}} involved with creating graphic designs and electronic media incorporated in television productions that are used by <b>character</b> <b>generator</b> (<b>CG)</b> operators. A broadcast designer may have a degree in digital media (or a similar degree), or is self-taught in the software needed to create such content. CG stands for computer graphics, most broadcast designers studied either graphic design or visual communicationthis term is used for those designing motion graphics also for film, industrials, commercials, and the web.|$|E
50|$|A {{graphics}} coordinator, GC, or font assist is {{an individual}} who works, usually on a television show, as a producer of on-air still and motion graphics. The graphics coordinator decides what content should be displayed on-air - such as on a fullpage (a full-screen graphic) or a lower third (a bar graphic appearing in the lower third of the screen). The GC {{should not be confused}} with the Operator, who usually operates a <b>character</b> <b>generator</b> (<b>CG)</b> and is part of a television crew, or a broadcast designer who physically creates the graphics.|$|E
50|$|Video editing {{reached its}} full {{potential}} in the late 1970s when computer-controlled minicomputer edit controllers along with communications protocols were developed, which could orchestrate an edit based on an EDL, using timecode to synchronize multiple tape machines and auxiliary devices using a 9-Pin Protocol. The most popular and widely used computer edit systems came from Sony, Ampex and the venerable CMX. Systems such as these were expensive, especially when considering auxiliary equipment like VTR, video switchers and <b>character</b> <b>generators</b> (<b>CG)</b> and were usually limited to high-end post-production facilities.|$|R
50|$|Typically a {{satellite}} truck {{will have its}} own on-board power source such as an electrical generator or inverter to create the alternating current to power all the transmission systems, {{which makes it a}} true independent mobile satellite transmission entity. Often such trucks also have various degrees of video production equipment and video editing gear. This equipment allows these trucks to also act as mobile electronic news gathering (ENG) facilities, or they can even be outfitted to do an electronic field production (EFP) to create an entire television show with multiple switched professional video cameras, <b>character</b> <b>generators</b> (<b>CG)</b> for digital on-screen graphics, video tape recorders (VTR) and video servers.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s to mid-1990s, {{expensive}} proprietary graphics {{systems such as}} those from British-based Quantel were quite commonplace in many television stations. Quantel workstations such as the Hal, Henry, Harry, Mirage and Paintbox were the broadcast graphics standard of the time. Many other real time graphics systems were used such as Ampex ADO, Abekas and K-Scope for live Digital video effects. Early proprietary 3D computer systems were also developed specifically for broadcast design such as the Bosch FGS-4000 which {{was used in the}} music video for Dire Straits Money for Nothing (song). The advent of more powerful desktop computers running Photoshop in the mid-90s drastically lowered the costs for producing digital graphics. With the reduced cost of producing motion graphics on a computer, the discipline has seen more widespread use. With the availability of desktop programs such as Adobe After Effects, Discreet Combustion, and Apple Motion, motion graphics have become increasingly accessible. Modern <b>character</b> <b>generators</b> (<b>CG)</b> from Aston Broadcast Systems and Chyron Corporation's incorporate motion graphics.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{broadcast}} automation {{systems will}} {{have a series of}} common device drivers built in, for example Sony VTR control (aka Sony Serial), Louth Video Disk Control Protocol (VDCP, a proprietary communications protocol), General Purpose Interface (GPI), or Grass Valley Group M21 Master Control. This ensures that a broadcast automation system bought [...] "off the shelf" [...] will at least be able to ingest and playout content, although {{may not be able to}} take advantage of more efficient methods of control. Most server, and especially most digital on-screen graphic and <b>character</b> <b>generator</b> (<b>CG)</b> manufacturers {{will have a}} specific device driver for their device, with increasing degrees of complexity, and different automation companies will include these drivers to enhance their product or to fit a customers need.|$|E
5000|$|Parts of the {{television}} crew {{are located in the}} first and largest part, the video production area. The television director, technical director, assistant director, <b>character</b> <b>generator</b> (<b>CG)</b> operator and television producers usually sit in front of a wall of video monitors. The technical director sits in front of the video switcher. The video monitors show all the video feeds from various sources, including computer graphics, professional video cameras, video tape recorder (VTR), video servers and slow-motion replay machines. The wall of monitors also contains a preview monitor showing what could be the next source on air (does not have to be depending on how the video switcher is set up) and a program monitor that shows the feed currently going to air or being recorded. The keyed dirty feed (with digital on-screen graphic) is what is actually transmitted back to the central studio that is controlling the outside broadcast. A clean feed (without the graphics) could be sent to other trucks for use in their production. The video switcher is usually operated by one person called the technical director (TD) and is responsible for switching the video sources to air as directed. Behind the directors there is usually a desk with monitors for the editors to operate. It is essential that the directors and editors are in communication with each other during events, so that replays and slow-motion shots can be selected and aired. The [...] "production room" [...] in most sporting events has a graphics operator and sometimes a font coordinator who are in charge of the graphics, statistics, and the showing of the names of commentators or the players to be shown on air. Most sports also have a [...] "box operator" [...] (or [...] "bug box operator") who controls the graphic seen either on the bottom or top of the screen that shows the score as seen at home. These operators can also show on-air stats, control the clock, and many times are also in charge of showing sponsors during play.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{its most}} memorable use was in American {{broadcast}} television graphics. Chyron's , Max!, and Maxine! series of television <b>character</b> <b>generators</b> used the 68060 {{as the main}} processor. These <b>character</b> <b>generators</b> were a fixture on many American television networks' affiliate stations.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Character</b> <b>generators</b> are {{primarily}} {{used in the}} broadcast areas of live television sports or television news presentations, given that the modern <b>character</b> <b>generator</b> can rapidly (i.e., [...] "on the fly") generate high-resolution, animated graphics for use when an unforeseen situation in a broadcast dictates an opportunity for breaking news coverage—for example, when, in a football game, a previously unknown player begins to have what looks to become an outstanding day, the <b>character</b> <b>generator</b> operator can rapidly build a new graphic using the template [...] "shell" [...] of a similarly-designed graphic. The <b>character</b> <b>generator</b> {{is one of many}} technologies used {{to meet the demands of}} live television, where events on the field or in the newsroom dictate the direction of the coverage. As <b>character</b> <b>generator</b> development has progressed, the distinction between hardware and software generators has become less distinct as new platforms and operating systems evolve to meet the live television consumer's expectations.|$|R
