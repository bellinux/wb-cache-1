A method is proposed to reduce these problems. The proposed method characterizes driving cycles and generates alternative cycles with an arbitrary length from an existing cycle, based on the characteristics of the original.

40|$|During {{tethered}} flight in Drosophila melanogaster, spike {{activity of the}} second basalar flight-control muscle (M. b 2) is correlated {{with an increase in}} both the ipsilateral wing beat amplitude and the ipsilateral flight force. The frequency of muscle spikes within a burst is about 100 Hz, or 1 spike for every two wing <b>beat</b> <b>cycles.</b> When M. b 2 is active, its spikes tend to occur within a comparatively narrow phase band of the wing <b>beat</b> <b>cycle.</b> To understand the functional role of this phase-lock of firing in the control of flight forces, we stimulated M. b 2 in selected phases of the wing <b>beat</b> <b>cycle</b> and recorded the effect on the ipsilateral wing beat amplitude. Varying the phase timing of the stimulus had a significant effect on the wing beat amplitude. A maximum increase of wing beat amplitude was obtained by stimulating M. b 2 {{at the beginning of the}} upstroke or about 1 ms prior to the narrow phase band in which the muscle spikes typically occur during flight. Assuming a delay of 1 ms between the stimulation of the motor nerve and muscle activation, these results indicate that M. b 2 is activated at an instant of the stroke cycle that produces the greatest effect on wing beat amplitude...|$|R
