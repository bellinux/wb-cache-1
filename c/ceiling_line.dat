50|$|Pilasters also {{frame the}} windows within the auditorium, with picture panels between them. A molded cornice {{is at the}} <b>ceiling</b> <b>line.</b> The stage also has wainscoting and a molded chair rail.|$|E
50|$|Internally the {{building}} has undergone a variety of alterations. The original stair remains {{to the right of}} the entry but its timber structure and railing have been painted. On the top level large brackets which support the trusses are exposed, but the <b>ceiling</b> <b>line</b> is not original. A suspended ceiling comes down below the window heads on the ground floor.|$|E
50|$|A {{mono-pitched roof}} {{can also be}} a smaller {{addition}} to an existing roof, where keeping to the same slope (roof pitch) puts the mono-pitched roof lower than the ceiling height of the main structure. In this case even though the main roof has a flat ceiling, the mono-pitched part will have a sloping, or raked, <b>ceiling</b> <b>line</b> to maximise the ceiling height. The name lean-to roof comes from this form of addition.|$|E
50|$|Verandahs have raked <b>ceilings</b> <b>lined</b> in pine, and are {{enclosed}} with painted timber louvres. Interior {{walls and}} <b>ceilings</b> are <b>lined</b> with painted pine boards, with wall linings {{to the passage}} side.|$|R
50|$|Internally, the {{building}} has a raked <b>ceiling</b> <b>lined</b> with compressed sheeting, and rendered walls with the northern internal gable being unrendered stone.|$|R
50|$|The {{main room}} has a coved <b>ceiling</b> <b>lined</b> with {{tongue-and-groove}} boarding with coved corner mouldings and cornice and exposed timber truss bases. There are winding mechanisms for the tilting fanlights.|$|R
50|$|Internally, {{the rear}} {{section of the}} {{building}} has similar finishes, with a large central room with an internal stair to the laundry and garage below, a panel of hopper windows to the southwest with leadlight panels above, and a large ceiling rose. Two bedrooms are located to the southeast, and a bathroom links into the original verandah which is expressed in the <b>ceiling</b> <b>line.</b> A study and a kitchen with a brick fireplace, consisting of the original kitchen wing, are located on the northwest.|$|E
50|$|On {{the walls}} fluted {{composite}} pilasters with cushioned egg-and-dart capitals {{rise to a}} modillioned entablature with triglyphs at the <b>ceiling</b> <b>line.</b> The ceiling itself is mostly flat. On the north wall, artificial lighting behind {{the windows in the}} shallow transepts, now blocked by the Sunday School wing, balances the natural light on the other side. The chancel features the same wall treatment {{as the rest of the}} sanctuary, with an elliptical arched molding above. It is topped by the bullseye window, set with stained glass depicting Christ in Gethsemane. The pilasters and entablature continue in the choir loft as well.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} New Haven Line {{stations}} in Westchester County, the station became a Penn Central station upon acquisition by Penn Central in 1969, and eventually {{became part of}} the MTA's Metro-North Railroad. On October 25, 1987, New Rochelle became eastern Westchester County's Amtrak station, replacing Rye Station which served as the county's eastern Amtrak station since 1972. The station was fully renovated in 1990, and careful attention was placed on restoring it to its original historic accuracy. The waiting room is reflective of New Haven line stations, with plaster walls, a wood ceiling and wood wainscot sheathing. The original floor was probably wood, but was replaced sometime in the 1930s with Terrazzo. There are wood moldings around the doors, and crown moldings enhance the perimeter at the <b>ceiling</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is constructed of unreinforced mass concrete footings, floor and walls, constructed from crushed coral, sand and cement. The building has a timber framed gable roof clad with fibrous cement sheeting. Timber roof trusses are exposed internally {{and there is}} no internal <b>ceiling</b> <b>lining.</b>|$|R
50|$|The street facade, which faces {{approximately}} north northeast, is symmetrically arranged. It {{consists of}} a skillion roofed footpath awning supported by five timber posts, a glazed shopfront below the awning and a decorative parapet wall above. A flat <b>ceiling</b> <b>lines</b> {{the underside of the}} awning.|$|R
50|$|The kitchen, a {{light and}} airy {{rectangular}} room lit by banks of hopper windows, projects between the original northern and western corner rooms. The roof is framed with steel web trusses, the <b>ceiling</b> <b>lined</b> with fibre cement sheeting and the kitchen fit-out is modern.|$|R
5000|$|Cast-iron {{and steel}} {{construction}} were both relatively new techniques, {{and construction of}} the Diamond Exchange suffered a major setback in October 1893 when a powerful windstorm caused the incomplete cage to shift about [...] from plumb. The problem was eventually traced back to oversized holes in splices on the cast-iron columns. Each new story added to the cage permitted additional movement, and {{the force of the}} wind was sufficient to cause the whole structure to tilt. To resolve the problem, the builders were forced to install [...] "knee braces" [...] at the <b>ceiling</b> <b>line</b> of each story, converting the original unbraced cage to a braced design. The same flaw would, in 1904, lead to the tragic collapse of the eleven story Darlington Hotel, also in New York, which killed 25 construction workers.|$|E
5000|$|Gaston Hall {{is often}} {{referred}} to as the [...] "jewel in the crown" [...] of Georgetown's campus due to its ornate interior and grand adornments. The <b>ceiling</b> <b>line</b> bears the coats of arms of the sixty Jesuit universities in the world at the time of Gaston's construction, all beneath a decorated wood ceiling. In addition, a number of classical allegorical scenes that fill the walls were painted freehand (without a stencil) by Francis Schroen, a Jesuit Brother who was a reputed interior designer and painter of Catholic institutions and several other rooms with Healy Hall. Behind the stage are paintings of Athena, goddess of wisdom, and a [...] "classically draped male." [...] He painted two large murals above the stage, the left symbolically depicting Morality, Faith, and Patriotism, and the right depicting Art, Alma Mater, and Science.|$|E
50|$|The 1890 {{section of}} the homestead, {{elevated}} on round timber posts, comprises five rooms of varying sizes all opening onto a wide verandah which surrounds the section. This section has a low pitched hipped roof clad with corrugated iron sheets, extending over the verandahs where it is lined with fibrous cement lining sheets with timber cover strips concealing edges. The verandah is supported on slender square planned posts which have partially chamfered corners {{and sit on the}} hand rail of the chamfer board cladded balustrade. Infilling some of the verandah openings are a series of early timber louvres. The building is constructed from wide, horizontal hardwood slabs housed in dressed vertical studs. Doors and windows in this section are housed frames between the studs. The windows are vertical sash with two sheets of glass per pane. The doors in this {{section of the}} building are four panelled with bolection mouldings on the horizontal edges of the panels and chamfered vertical edges. Above most of the doors but separated by two sections of timber slab, are operable transom windows, aligned with the <b>ceiling</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
50|$|Internal {{walls and}} <b>ceiling</b> are <b>lined</b> with fibrous cement sheeting.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the hall is a large and well lit space with a timber floor and vaulted <b>ceiling</b> <b>lined</b> with timber. The nave has square timber posts on each side supporting the clerestory and is continuously arcaded. There is a modern kitchen in the western end and a stage at the other.|$|R
50|$|Internal framing is {{provided}} by substantial timber columns, bearers and joists, with <b>ceilings</b> <b>lined</b> with galvanised ripple iron {{to the ground and}} first floors. Steel box beams are also used in some areas to increase clear spans. Flooring consists of rough sawn timber boards, some areas of which have been sheeted over, and piers to the basement and sub-floor are masonry. The roof has timber framed trusses with bolted connections, forming a saw-tooth profile, with glass louvred clerestory windows. <b>Ceilings</b> are <b>lined</b> on the rake with beaded tongue and groove boarding, and the roof is sheeted with corrugated iron.|$|R
50|$|The framed tent {{quarters}} {{consist of}} two gable-roofed structures and a skillion-roofed bathroom. The northern structure is clad with corrugated iron {{and has a}} skillion-roofed stove recess to the north, and the southern structure is clad with chamferboard with timber studs exposed internally. Just {{to the east of}} the northern structure is a small bathroom clad with fibrous cement sheeting. All three elements of the quarters are linked by an open timber deck. The two main structures stand on concrete stumps, while the bathroom stands on metal stumps. The roof of the southern structure used to be supported independently on freestanding timber posts and over-sailed the <b>ceiling</b> <b>line</b> {{in the form of a}} tent. This has collapsed to the ground, although the roof of the southern structure is still clad with timber boards. There are two tank stands, to the east and west of the quarters, although only the east stand still has a corrugated iron tank. A corrugated iron-clad earth closet is located to the north of the quarters. The cattle yards are steel; with a loading ramp to the fork, and the northern section of the yards is made of timber.|$|E
50|$|The eastern {{projecting}} wings, {{and northern}} infill bedroom, have projecting triangular bay units with sash windows and skillion awnings. The upper {{section of the}} walls, between window heads and eaves, is finished with hardboard sheeting with spaced vertical battens giving a horizontal band around the building and separating the higher and lower gutter lines. The southern bathroom has a patented Marks' AUSTRAL window, and the dining room has twin sashes. Internally, the building has timber skirtings and cornices, with vertically jointed boarding to walls to all rooms, except the central octagonal room which has horizontal boarding to the fanlight head height and vertical boarding above. Ceilings are boarded, with the central room having skylights located above the <b>ceiling</b> <b>line</b> forming angled recesses. This room has timber doors with glass panes and glass fanlights located below {{the north and east}} skylights, and a fireplace located on the southwest wall with an ornate timber surround with tiled inserts and a boarded chimney stack with timber mantle. A doorway has been inserted {{to the west of the}} chimney, and accesses the southwest dining room which may have been the original kitchen. This room has a concrete slab which may have been the hearth of a fireplace backing onto the existing living room fireplace.|$|E
50|$|In {{statistical}} modeling, {{regression analysis}} is a statistical process for estimating {{the relationships among}} variables. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when {{the focus is on}} the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors'). More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or 'criterion variable') changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed. Most commonly, regression analysis estimates the conditional expectation of the dependent variable given the independent variables - that is, the average value of the dependent variable when the independent variables are fixed. Less commonly, the focus is on a quantile, or other location parameter of the conditional distribution of the dependent variable given the independent variables. In all cases, the estimation target is a function of the independent variables called the regression function. In regression analysis, it is also of interest to characterize the variation of the dependent variable around the regression function which can be described by a probability distribution. A related but distinct approach is necessary condition analysis (NCA), which estimates the maximum (rather than average) value of the dependent variable for a given value of the independent variable (<b>ceiling</b> <b>line</b> rather than central line) in order to identify what value of the independent variable is necessary but not sufficient for a given value of the dependent variable.|$|E
50|$|He {{integrated}} {{the alarm}} system into the door-gate using counterweights {{to lower the}} horse collars, also counter-weighting the sheets and blankets into the dormitory fly-space (the reason early firehouses had high <b>ceilings),</b> <b>lined</b> horse stalls with plush carpeting, and provided a library {{as well as a}} custom carved pool table for the men's recreation.|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} the studies that are here {{reported}} is to determine which combinations of floor, wall, and <b>ceiling</b> <b>lining</b> materials, in a corridor, will sustain and propagate a fully developed fire. The work is not yet completed and this report is merely a statement of progress to date. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
50|$|Concerts {{were held}} in the barn, and still are, with such acts as Cochise, Geier Sturzflug, Helge Schneider, Killerpilze, Wir sind Helden and In Extremo. Early in 2007, the barn's <b>ceiling</b> <b>lining</b> was {{destroyed}} by a storm, but with help from unpaid workers, the youth centre had a complete, new paint job inside by the summer.|$|R
50|$|The Frank Moran Memorial Hall {{is located}} {{south-west}} of the AASC drill hall. It is a single-storey timber building sited on low concrete stumps, with a gabled roof sheeted with corrugated steel. A skillion roofed addition is located {{to the rear}} of the building to the south. The interior features VJ timber walls and original <b>ceiling</b> <b>lining.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{projection}} room, with {{walls and}} <b>ceilings</b> <b>lined</b> with flat sheeting and timber Battens is located over the entrance foyer with the mezzanine [...] "dress circle" [...] either side accessed via timber {{steps from the}} aisles. The dress circle extends several metres along {{the walls of the}} auditorium and its solid balustrade is surmounted by a timber railing.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper floor}} has walls lined with {{vertically}} fixed painted chamferboards and plasterboard sheeting. The <b>ceiling</b> is <b>lined</b> with plasterboard with some recessed ceiling panels visible. Floors {{are lined with}} recent linoleum strip sheeting with carpet in some areas. The internal stairwell has walls lined with long lengths of chamferboards and fibre cement sheeting with cover strips. The staircase has treads and risers of polished timber and balustrades with timber cappings. The balcony space has walls and <b>ceilings</b> <b>lined</b> with plasterboard. On the lower floor walls and ceilings are generally unlined with some early louvre windows visible which are hidden behind cladding on the outside.|$|R
50|$|Internally {{the main}} cottage has a recent {{concrete}} slab floor, rendered walls and <b>ceilings</b> <b>lined</b> with beaded {{tongue and groove}} boards. The cottage {{is divided into two}} by a load bearing masonry wall that houses two fireplaces - one to each side. The northern portion of the cottage was once two rooms and evidence survives of the location of the dividing wall.|$|R
50|$|Entry is via {{two sets}} of steel and timber stairs onto the {{verandah}}, which has a timber floor and a <b>ceiling</b> <b>lined</b> on the rake with v-jointed timber boards. The verandah has a small room at either end formed by walls of single-skin, timber, v-jointed boards. These rooms retain early timber doors with glazed panels and fanlights as well as timber shelving and a sink.|$|R
50|$|The two {{sections}} are {{connected by a}} central stair hall. Another stair hall {{is located at the}} western end of the wing with a door out into a small yard to Ruthven Street, forming a secondary entrance into the school. The stair halls have timber stairs, unpainted timber floors, facebrick and chamferboard walls, raked <b>ceilings</b> <b>lined</b> with sheet material, and are brightly-lit by timber-framed, fixed, opaque glazing.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of St Mary's Church remains relatively intact. The apse features a timber-lined ceiling with exposed joists, {{and the internal}} walls are rendered brick. An important internal decorative feature of St Mary's Anglican Church is the extant rood screen. Internal church roof features include exposed truss work and roof purloins with no <b>ceiling</b> <b>lining,</b> thereby exposing {{the underside of the}} roof sheeting material.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the church has an open roof structure consisting of arched brace trusses with the <b>ceiling</b> <b>lined</b> in unpainted, stained diagonal timber boarding. Timbers used in the construction and furnishings of the church, such as cedar, are now rare or irreplaceable. Timber fittings include the pews, rails, pulpit and altar. Stained glass windows {{are located in the}} gabled sections in the north and south walls and the apse.|$|R
50|$|The {{community}} services {{building is a}} two storey building which steps down the site and houses a communal dining room, recreation areas and support facilities on the upper level with store rooms and more recently enclosed areas on the lower level to house student counselling services. The building has a large open timber trussed roof and sloping <b>ceilings</b> <b>lined</b> with straw board panels. Pergolas provide shade to several outdoor areas.|$|R
50|$|The {{external}} {{walls of the}} house are chamferboard while internal walls and <b>ceilings</b> are <b>lined</b> with beaded pine boards and feature cedar joinery.|$|R
50|$|The annex {{has similar}} {{finishes}} {{to the main}} garage room with <b>ceilings</b> <b>lined</b> on the rake with horizontally laid v-jointed boards. Walls are also lined with horizontally laid v-jointed boards. Rooms {{to the rear of}} the ambulance building have been lined with asbestos cement sheeting to both walls and ceilings. Ceilings to these rooms are lower and flat. Tongue and groove boards are visible on the floors in some of the rear rooms with some floors lined with carpet and linoleum.|$|R
