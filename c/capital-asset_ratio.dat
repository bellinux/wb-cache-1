40|$|The {{likelihood}} of a bank failing, within a given period of time, {{is a function of}} the variability in its income and its ability to withstand losses. These determinants depend, in turn, on the volatility of the return on bank assets and the bank’s level of capital. Although accounting measures of the volatility of the rate of return on bank assets and bank capital-asset ratios are published on a regular basis, market prices provide alternative risk measures. This paper uses share prices to estimate these risks measures for 15 Australian banks that were listed on the Australian Stock Exchange for all, or part of, the period 1983 to 1998. Option prices are also used to generate alternative estimates of these risk measures, the results of which corroborate those obtained from share prices. We find that the market’s assessment of the <b>capital-asset</b> <b>ratio</b> for the Australian banking sector has risen considerably over the sample period. There has also been a slight upward trend in the volatility of asset returns. These two trends have opposite effects on the market’s assessment of total bank risk: rising capital-asset ratios reduce bank risk, but rising asset volatility increases it. To uncover which trend has dominated, we examine a couple of measures of total bank risk, which summarises the net impact of movements in both the <b>capital-asset</b> <b>ratio</b> and asset volatility. These additional risk measures suggest that the riskiness of the sector has declined. In investigating the relationship between banks’ <b>capital-asset</b> <b>ratio</b> and asset volatility over time, we find that increases in the growth of the <b>capital-asset</b> <b>ratio</b> precede increases in asset volatility which, in turn, cause a slowdown in capital growth. solvency; capital; banking...|$|E

By contrast, in theoretical models of corporate finance, decisions are usually modeled in terms of capital levels rather than in terms of <b>capital-asset</b> <b>ratios.</b> We use a simple model of bank behavior to derive a relationship between the growth rate of lending and the growth rate of capital that does not require measuring an exact measure of the bank’s capital surplus.|$|R

This study uses data on loan syndications to test the importance of various factors that motivate the participants. Despite a significant number of problem credits among the syndicated loans studied, it finds little evidence of opportunistic behavior by the lead banks in syndications.

40|$|Public {{policy debate}} {{in regard to}} {{financial}} intermediaries has centered on whether governments should impose capital adequacy rules on banks, or whether market forces could also ensure the viability and stability of national and international banking systems.

If the effect of competition among banks is strong, then it may overcome the tendency for bank undercapitalization that arises from systemic effects (free riding, moral hazard). If systemic effects are strong, regulation is required. Empirical tests for the U. S. banking sector in the 1990 s show that better capitalized banks experienced lower borrowing costs. They also demonstrate, however, that bank competition cannot fully substitute for regulation because significant systemic effects exist. Regulation is required to mitigate free riding. These findings suggest that ongoing reform efforts (such as those concerning the Basle Accord) should focus primarily on increasing transparency and strengthening competition among banks...|$|R

40|$|The 1988 Basle Accord and its {{revisions}} {{have established}} international standards for bank capitalization to foster bank solvency and liquidity, prevent systemic financial crises, and {{to level the}} international playing field by imposing similar (and presumably costly) regulation on all banks. Surprisingly, notably from the level playing field perspective, we observe strong heterogeneity in bank capitalization across banks within individual countries as well as average bank capitalization across countries. Even more puzzling, there exists widespread over-compliance with national and international standards. This fact still awaits a satisfactory explanation. In this paper we seek {{to account for the}} phenomenon of over-compliance by studying the determinants of cross-country and cross-bank differences in <b>capital-asset</b> <b>ratios.</b> We consider four types of explanatory variables: Market pressure (competition), the properties of national regulatory regimes, general economic conditions, and individual bank characteristics. Our analysis of 1267 banks from 29 OECD countries in 1999 shows that market pressure (competition) promotes bank capitalization. Deposit insurance, contrary to the mainstream view, also contributes to higher bank capital, and so do weak general economic conditions. The effect of regulatory power and stringency is ambiguous. Our findings suggest competitive pressures as a key factor behind over-compliance with the Basle rules. Consequently, the emphasis of ongoing regulatory reform efforts (notably, those relating to the Basle Accord) should be on strengthening transparency and competition among banks and also on implementing policies that punish banks in trouble. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{far-reaching}} liberalization process {{introduced in}} Chile after {{the overthrow of}} the Allende regime first met with reasonable success, but in the early 1980 s a foreign-exchange crisis and a banking crisis appeared to mark the end of the experiment. Liberalization was resumed in 1985 and has not been plagued by serious crises since. The root of the problem seems to have been an exchange rate policy which had to be abandoned, but not before it had led economic actors to make the wrong decisions. The lack of prudential supervision of the financial system did the rest. So far, Indonesia has been following much more cautious exchange rate policies in its liberalization drive. Crises on the scale experienced by Chile are not very likely to occur. The lessons provided by the lack of prudential supervision in Chile do not, however, seem to have been taken to heart, or not sufficiently. Even if the Indonesian banks are unlikely to suffer as much as their Chilean opposite numbers from foreign exchange risks, bad loans, in particular resulting from intra-conglomerate lending, are an increasingly serious prohlem. In dealing with troubled banks the Indonesian authorities have not repeated the mistake of the Chileans to provide a full deposit guarantee. Nonetheless, excellent though the banking rules may look on paper, the implementation leaves much to be desired and Indonesia probably has not yet seen the end of its banking troubles. Apparently, market imperfections are such that effective prudential supervision cannot be dispensed with. Also, it appears that low <b>capital-asset</b> <b>ratios</b> in both banks and their clients, as in Chile in the mid- 1970 s, call for a cautious course in liberalization.

40|$|While {{development}} of sound, market-oriented banking systems {{is fundamental to}} the transition, bank intermediation remains stunted after {{a decade or more}} of reform. This paper examines the impact of banking and enterprise reforms and other factors on banking development in transition economies at both the aggregate level and that of individual banks. A unique contribution of the paper is the analysis of a new panel data set of 515 banks in 16 transition economies for the years 1994 - 99. The analyses show that progress in banking reform is {{the sine qua non of}} banking development. However, even where banking reforms have advanced, the real expansion of bank loans has failed to keep pace with output growth. There is significant evidence that privatised banks and those with higher <b>capital-asset</b> <b>ratios</b> are expanding more rapidly than state-owned banks and ab initio private banks. While foreignmajority ownership of a bank is associated with neither stronger nor weaker real growth in its customer loans, a greater presence of foreign banks in a banking system has a positive spillover effect in spurring the real expansion of loans. These results contrast with evidence from the transition economies of relatively strong growth performance by ab initio private and foreign-owned enterprises in the non-financial sectors. Taken together, the findings point to the need for policies that can strengthen supply response of banks to progress in banking and enterprise reforms. These measures include the more effective regulation of the entry and exit of banks, removal of obstacles to the expansion of foreign-owned banks and the transfer of technology and banking skills that expand access to finance, particularly by small and medium-sized enterprises.

40|$|Most {{previous}} studies of credit union growth used data from the 1990 s. This study uses 2002 - 2004 data from mid-sized cities, {{in order to be}} more representative of distinct local markets. In addition, two new independent variables, used vehicle loans rates and loan-to-total asset ratios, were included. Some studies have found that small credit unions grow faster than large ones, while others find the opposite is true. Bank growth studies report mixed results as well. Our model includes variables used in other growth studies, such as credit union size, previous growth, ratio of loans charged off, operating expense ratio, <b>capital-asset</b> <b>ratio,</b> and the ratio of fee income to total assets. In addition, the two new independent variables listed above add to our knowledge of factors that influence credit union growth. When comparing average growth rates of different size credit unions, large credit unions grew faster than small credit unions. However, the regression results show that once we hold other factors constant, small credit unions grew faster. In other words, differences in growth rates may be explained by characteristics other than size alone. Of the two variables not previously tested in other studies, the loan-to-asset ratio, as expected, had a positive effect on growth. This suggests that credit unions with tighter liquidity are more aggressive in attracting deposits, which leads to higher growth rates. However, higher used vehicle loan rates were associated with higher growth [...] an unexpected finding. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} banks {{have had to}} operate in an {{increasingly}} competitive environment. How banks {{will be affected by}} the increased competitive pressures depends in part on how efficiently they are run. This paper uses the stochastic econometric cost frontier approach to study efficiency at banks in the Third Federal Reserve District. The paper looks at scale efficiency - whether banks are operating with the efficient level of outputs; scope efficiency - whether banks are operating with the efficient mix of outputs; and x-efficiency - whether banks are using their inputs efficiently. The cost model differs from previous studies in that it explicitly accounts for the quality of banks' assets and the probability of failure, which influences banks' costs in a number of ways. The paper also differs from previous studies in its treatment of financial capital as an input into the production process. In addition to providing a cushion against losses, financial capital can be used to fund loans as a substitute for deposits or borrowed funds. The paper differs in a third way in reporting confidence intervals for the bank- specific measures of efficiency. There {{do not seem to be}} many cost efficiency gains made from Third District banks' changing their sizes, and these results are much like those obtained in studies using U. S. samples. The model shows that there is no evidence of either scope economies or diseconomies at the average efficient bank in the Third District, nor at banks in different size categories. While the scope measures suggest there is no cost justification for joint production, the approach leaves open the possibility of revenue benefits. Average x-inefficiency at banks in the Third District is on the order of 6 % to 9 %. In competitive markets not all of this gain would be retained by the bank - the savings would be passed on to customers - increasing overall welfare. When compared to U. S. samples, Third District banks seem to be outperforming U. S. bankers on average in this regard. A simple correlation and regression results indicate that inefficient banks in the District tend to be younger. There is no statistically significant differences in efficiency across the three states. There is no evidence that larger banks are more or less x-efficient than smaller banks. Inefficient banks have a higher percentage of loans in construction and land development, and loans to individuals. One of the more interesting relationships is the negative relationship between inefficiency and the <b>capital-asset</b> <b>ratio.</b> It may indicate that higher capital may prevent moral hazard. In conclusion, inefficient banks may have more to fear from efficient producers than from banks producing particular volume or product mix. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{financial stability}} in eight {{members of the}} Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP) economies. One {{of the factors that}} may increase financial imbalances (and hence it affects financial stability of an economy) is the accumulated outstanding debt of the economic agents. For example, the corporate sector’s outstanding debt can negatively affect activity of lenders and hence the capabilities of the economy. Since banks are important financial intermediaries in most financial systems, the financial status of banking sector is also important to analyse financial stability of a country. Macroeconomic conditions and financial system structure are some of the important factors that can affect financial conditions (financial soundness) of banks and hence the banking sector. Financial soundness of banks can secure the stability of the financial system. Chapter 2 shows that financial imbalances that arise from accumulated outstanding debt within the corporate sector {{have a negative effect on}} the technical capabilities (total factor productivity) of the economy. Therefore, monetary authority (central bank) should control over the debt level. To address this, chapter 2 focuses on the design of monetary policy rule for a small open economy in the context of a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model. This model is extended to show the effects of financial imbalances on the economy. Real exchange rate is another important factor that affects the firm’s real marginal cost, aggregate supply and aggregate demand as discussed in this chapter. The derived optimal monetary policy rule indicates that the monetary authority responds to financial imbalances through output gap when financial imbalances exist due to accumulated outstanding debt. Moreover, the optimal policy rule shows that the response of the monetary authority to exchange rate movements is indirect, through the domestic inflation and output gap. Chapter 3 describes the effect of the financial system structure on financial stability through investigating the financial soundness of the banking sector. Bank financial soundness is the measure of the stability of the financial system and is defined by return on assets, equity <b>capital-asset</b> <b>ratio</b> and return volatility. The first two items increase financial soundness, whereas return volatility decreases financial soundness of a bank. The structure of the financial system is described as market-based or bank-based. Given interrelations between financial sectors and between economies of the EMEAP countries, chapter 3 uses the global (infinite dimensional) vector autoregressive (VAR) model that has been proposed recently to estimate the generalised impulse responses of financial stability measure. Results show that the market-based financial system can increase financial stability through increasing financial soundness of the banking system. Chapter 4 uses nonperforming loans (NPLs) (as one of the main factors behind Asian financial crisis in 1997 / 8) to analyse financial soundness of banks. NPLs determine loans default rates that decreases banks’ financial soundness. Chapter 4 tests the resistance of the banking system of the EMEAP countries to large macroeconomic shocks (stresses) in a stress-test framework, computing frequency distributions of default rates in three main macroeconomic scenarios (baseline model, stressed real GDP growth and stressed real interest rate). Default rate indicates the possible loss of banks and hence it is an indicator of credit risk which weakens banks’ financial strength. The stress-test indicates that stressing real GDP growth with negative extreme shocks leads to an increase in frequency of higher default rates (in comparison with the baseline model), whereas positive shock to real interest rate may secure financial stability through increasing the frequency of lower default rates and decreasing frequency of higher default rate...|$|E
