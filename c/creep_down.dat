25|$|The first {{decades of}} the 21st century have {{witnessed}} the rapid gentrification of these neighborhoods. Istiklal Avenue has once again become a destination for tourists, and formerly bohemian neighborhoods like Cihangir have once again become fashionable and quite expensive. Some 19th and early 20th century buildings have been tastefully restored, while others have been converted into mammoth luxury malls of dubious aesthetic value. As newer, more international and affluent residents have begun to <b>creep</b> <b>down</b> the hills into Tophane and Tarlabasi, disagreements with more conservative elements in the neighborhoods have become common.|$|E
500|$|The 4th Australian Division {{continued}} {{the attack on}} the II Anzac Corps front, the right hand brigade reaching the assembly areas by [...] before learning of the postponement. The brigade had to lie on open ground under German artillery and machine-gun fire, which caused considerable loss but the left brigade was informed in time to hold back until [...] The bombardment began to <b>creep</b> <b>down</b> the slope at [...] at a rate of [...] in three minutes. The right brigade advanced on a [...] front towards the Oosttaverne line, from the river Douve north to the Blauwepoortbeek (Blue Gate Brook). German machine-gunners in the pillboxes of the Oosttaverne line caused many casualties but with support from three tanks the Australians reached the pillboxes, except for those {{to the north of the}} Messines–Warneton road. As the Australians outflanked the strongpoints, the Germans tried to retreat through the British barrage, which had stopped moving [...] beyond the rear trench of the Oosttaverne line. The left brigade was stopped on its right flank by fire from the German pillboxes north of the Messines–Warneton road up to the Blauwepoortbeek, [...] short of the Oosttaverne line, with many casualties. The left battalion, unaware that the 33rd Brigade (11th Division) to the north had been delayed, veered towards the north-east to try to make contact near Lumm Farm, which took the battalion across the Wambeke Spur instead of straight down. The objective was easily reached but at the Wambeek, [...] north of the intended position. The Australians extended their line further north to Polka Estaminet trying to meet the 33rd Brigade, which arrived at [...] with four tanks. The brigade took Joye and Van Hove farms beyond the objective, silencing the machine-guns being fired from them.|$|E

60|$|This {{entrance}} into the Pyramids is a terrible task, which should be undertaken by no lady.

60|$|After a {{few minutes}} of watching, the duck went into the grass again, and I started to <b>creep</b> <b>down</b> the hill, keeping my eyes intently on the pond. Halfway down, another duck appeared, and I dropped flat on the {{hillside}} in plain sight. Of course the duck noticed the unusual object. There was a commotion in the grass; heads came up here and there. The next moment, to my great astonishment, fully fifty black ducks were swimming about in the greatest uneasiness.|$|E
60|$|The {{black dot}} grew {{to a dark}} patch moving under low dust clouds. It grew all the time, though very slowly.

Gradually, however, as time passed, it began to enlarge, to <b>creep</b> <b>down</b> the slope, to encroach upon the intervening distance.|$|E
