5|$|During {{development}} {{and construction of}} the park, many structures were added, redesigned or modified. These changes often resulted in budget increases. For example, the bandshell's proposed budget was $10.8million. When the elaborate, <b>cantilevered</b> Gehry design required extra pilings to be driven into the bedrock to support the added weight, {{the cost of the}} bandshell eventually spiraled to $60.3million. The cost of the park, as itemized in the following table, amounted to almost $500million.|$|E

40|$|Aim: This study aims {{to analyze}} the stress {{patterns}} and displacement in the <b>cantilever</b> resin bonded fixed partial denture (RBFPD) and compare it with the conventional <b>cantilever</b> fixed partial denture using 3 -D finite element analysis. Also, the effect of cement on the displacement and stress patterns in conventional <b>cantilever</b> fixed partial denture was to be analyzed. Materials and Methods: Three-dimensional models were prepared layer wise to depict the conventional <b>cantilever</b> and the <b>cantilever</b> RBFPD. Once the models were made, the material properties were assigned and divided into three groups. (2 -conventional <b>cantilever</b> with resin cement, 1 - conventional <b>cantilever</b> with GIC cement and 3 -resin bonded <b>cantilever</b> with resin cement). Load was applied in vertical as well as lateral directions and the stress patterns along with displacement were analyzed. Results: The results revealed that the von Mises stresses in all the three groups {{were found to be}} almost equal under vertical loading. Under lateral loading, the stress was more in <b>cantilever</b> RBFPD. Displacement in all the three axes was significantly less in the <b>cantilever</b> RBFPD.

40|$|A {{piezoelectric}} <b>cantilever</b> with a non-piezoelectric, or piezoelectric tip {{useful as}} mass and viscosity sensors. The {{change in the}} <b>cantilever</b> mass can be accurately quantified by monitoring a resonance frequency shift of the <b>cantilever.</b> For bio-detection, antibodies or other specific receptors of target antigens may be immobilized on the <b>cantilever</b> surface, preferably on the non-piezoelectric tip.

40|$|The {{invention}} of the atomic force microscope (AFM) revolutionized the scientific world by providing researchers {{with the ability to}} make topographical maps of both conducting and non-conducting surfaces with nanometer resolution. As an alternative to optical AFM methods, thermal <b>cantilevers</b> have been investigated as a method to measure topography. This study reports the fabrication and testing of heated AFM <b>cantilevers.</b> This study transfers a fabrication process first developed at Stanford University to the Georgia Institute of Technology micro-fabrication facility and fabricates six different heated AFM <b>cantilever</b> designs. Selective impurity doping of a silicon <b>cantilever</b> allows it to become electrically conductive with a resistive element near the <b>cantilever</b> free end. Voltage applied across the <b>cantilever</b> legs induces current flow through the <b>cantilever</b> that generates heat in the resistive element. A deep understanding of the operational behavior and limits of the AFM <b>cantilever</b> is required to use the <b>cantilever</b> as an experimental tool. Characterization experiments determined the <b>cantilever</b> electrical resistance and temperature response. Experiments were conducted that electrically test heated AFM <b>cantilevers</b> at various system input voltages.

Results of this study show that the fabricated heated AFM <b>cantilevers</b> have a tip with a radius of curvature as small as 20 nm. <b>Cantilever</b> temperatures can exceed 700 㠩n short pulses and, because the resistive heating element is also a temperature sensor, calibration of the <b>cantilever</b> temperature response is possible to within 1 㮍M.

40|$|The {{choice on}} which <b>cantilever</b> {{to use for}} Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) depends {{on the type of}} the {{experiment}} being done. Usually, the <b>cantilevers</b> have to be exchanged when a different stiffness is required and the entire alignment has to be repeated. In the present work, we have developed a method to adjust the stiffness of the AFM <b>cantilever</b> in situ, without having to exchange the <b>cantilever.</b> The adjustment is achieved by changing the effective length of the <b>cantilever</b> by electrostatic pull-in. By applying a voltage between the <b>cantilever</b> and an electrode (with an insulating layer at the point of contact), the <b>cantilever</b> snaps to the electrode, reducing the <b>cantilever’s</b> effective length. The working principle of this concept is demonstrated with a proof-of-concept experiment. The electrode was positioned close to a commercially available <b>cantilever</b> with a robotic nano-manipulator. To confirm the change in stiffness, the resonance frequency of the <b>cantilever</b> was measured for varying electrode positions. The results match the theoretical expectation.

5|$|The six storied Baden-Powell House is {{designed}} in the modern architectural style, as pioneered by the Swiss architect Le Corbusier from the late 1920s onwards, and predominating in the 1950s. At Baden-Powell House, Tubbs made the first floor overhang the ground floor, a LeCorbusier architectural design choice to free the building from the ground, such as seen in his Pavillon Suisse at the Cité Internationale Universitaire in Paris. Additionally, LeCorbusier's Sainte Marie de La Tourette priory in Lyon shows two floors of monk's cells with small windows, <b>cantilevered</b> over the more open floors below, another design choice used by Tubbs in the facade of Baden-Powell House. While Tubbs created Baden-Powell House in the modern architectural style of LeCorbusier, he used more architectural restraint in his own design choices. For example, he made the main visible building component brick rather than concrete. This heavier evolution of LeCorbusier's style was popular in England throughout the post-war years until replaced by the Brutalist style in the later 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Easter Road is an all-seated stadium, {{split into}} four {{geographic}} sections, {{known as the}} Famous Five (formerly North), East, South and West Stands. The Famous Five and South Stands are the oldest part of the present stadium, built in 1995. Each stand has two tiers, a <b>cantilevered</b> roof and a capacity of nearly 4,000. To keep {{within the boundaries of}} the site, the upper deck of each stand angles toward the centre. When the stands were built, the Famous Five Stand was above pitch level and the South Stand was below, but this was corrected when the natural slope was removed. Each stand also stretched beyond the east touchline, which was corrected by widening the pitch when the East Stand was rebuilt. Between the two tiers of the Famous Five Stand there are function suites and lounges. Before the stands were rebuilt in the 1990s, the north and south ends of Easter Road were known as the Cowshed and Dunbar End respectively. The southern end was called the Dunbar End because there was a lemonade factory named Dunbar's located behind it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Silicon atomic force {{microscope}} (AFM) <b>cantilevers</b> having integrated solid-state heaters {{were originally}} developed for application to data storage, but have since been applied to metrology, thermophysical property measurements, and nanoscale manufacturing.

Analysis of the <b>cantilever</b> response to electrical excitation in both time and frequency domains aids in resolving heat transfer mechanisms in the <b>cantilever.</b> Raman spectroscopy provides local temperature measurement along the <b>cantilever</b> with resolution near 1 m and 5 C and also provides local surface stress measurements.

Two years later alterations were made at the Anfield Road end, turning it into a larger covered standing area with refreshments under the structure. The biggest redevelopment came in 1973, when the old Main Stand was partially demolished and extended backwards with new roof. Simultaneously the concrete pylon floodlights were demolished with new lights installed along the rooflines of the Kemlyn Road and Main Stands. The new stand was officially opened by the Duke of Kent on 10 March 1973. In the 1980s the paddock in front of the Main Stand was turned into seating, and in 1982 seats were introduced at the Anfield Road end.

5|$|The {{long-term}} {{complications that}} result from restoring teeth with implants relate, directly, to the risk factors of {{the patient and the}} technology. There are the risks associated with appearance including a high smile line, poor gingival quality and missing papillae, difficulty in matching the form of natural teeth that may have unequal points of contact or uncommon shapes, bone that is missing, atrophied or otherwise shaped in an unsuitable manner, unrealistic expectations of the patient or poor oral hygiene. The risks can be related to biomechanical factors, where the geometry of the implants does not support the teeth in the same way the natural teeth did such as when there are <b>cantilevered</b> extensions, fewer implants than roots or teeth that are longer than the implants that support them (a poor crown-to-root ratio). Similarly, grinding of the teeth, lack of bone or low diameter implants increase the biomechanical risk. Finally there are technological risks, where the implants themselves can fail due to fracture or a loss of retention to the teeth they are intended to support.|$|E
5|$|The aircraft's {{construction}} was a novelty for the time. In {{contrast to the}} monoplane described in the July 1910 patent application, the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction, but in return solved lateral stability control issues. The <b>cantilevered</b> wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts without any bracing from flying wires. According to Coandă's description the wings were built with metal spars, but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure. The trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing, and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit. The fuselage, painted reddish-brown and highly polished, was described by The Technical World magazine as having a framework of steel, though the construction photographs indicate {{that it had a}} wooden framework. This was triangular in cross-section with convex ribs edged with strips of steel, and strengthened with a covering of heat-shaped moulded plywood. Tubular radiators for engine cooling were located {{on either side of the}} cockpit. The vertical struts from the wings were secured to the fuselage with steel collars fixed with screws. The fuselage terminated in a cruciform empennage with control surfaces at 45° angles to vertical and horizontal. Four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large Antoinette VII-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit, one on each side, and were used for pitch and directional control. It was an early instance of what are now known as ruddervators. Forward of the tail was a small horizontal stabiliser.
