40|$|The paper studies {{disc brake}} failure in Mini-buses using an {{experimental}} analysis {{to test the}} maximum braking force when different brake <b>fluids</b> such as <b>clean,</b> less dirty, dirty and soapy water solution {{were used in the}} braking system. The experimental results clearly showed that the soap solution appears to be the best fluid as far as low viscosity and stability of viscosity with increase in temperature are concerned. However, the soap solution is not compatible with other fluid which makes it difficult to be substitute as a <b>clean</b> brake <b>fluid.</b> The result of the Thepra Universal Brake Testing Equipment used for the braking efficiency test indicated that a pedal brake of 117 kN produce a brake force of 0. 96 kN for <b>clean</b> brake <b>fluid,</b> 0. 91 kN for the less dirty, 0. 85 kN for dirty and 1. 44 kN for soap solution.

40|$|The micromechanical {{equivalent}} of a differential pressure flow-sensor, well known in macro mechanics, is discussed. Two separate pressure sensors are used for the device, enabling to measure both, pressure as well as volume flow-rate. An integrated sensor with capacitive read-out {{as well as a}} hybrid, piezo-resistive variant is made. The fabrication processes are described, using silicon and glass processing techniques. Based on the sensor layout, equations are derived to describe the sensor behavior both statically as well as dynamically. With the derived equations, the working range of the sensor and the thermal and time stability is estimated. The computed results of the stationary behavior are verified with the measured data. A good similarity in linearity of the pressure/flow relation is found. The computed hydraulic resistance, however, differs from the measured value for water with 21 %. This difference {{can be explained by the}} high sensitivity of the resistance to the resistor channel cross-section parameter in combination with the difference between the rounded etched shape and the rectangular approximation. From fluid dynamics simulations, a working range bandwidth of about 1 kHz is expected. Thermal influences on the sensor signal due to viscosity changes are in the order of 2 % flow signal variation per Kelvin. From these results, it can be concluded that the sensor can be used as a low cost, low power consuming flow and pressure-sensing device, for <b>clean</b> <b>fluids</b> without particles and without the tendency to coat the channel walls.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{stability}} of particle laden flows. Both modal and non-modal linear analyses have been performed on two-way coupled particleladen flows, where particles are considered spherical, solid and either heavy or light. When heavy particles are considered, only Stokes drag is used as interaction term. Light particles cannot be modeled with Stokes drag alone, therefore added mass and fluid acceleration are used as additional interaction forces. The modal analysis investigates the asymptotic behavior of disturbances on a base flow, in this thesis a pressure-driven plane channel flow. A critical Reynolds number is found for particle laden flows: heavy particles increase the critical Reynolds number compared to a <b>clean</b> <b>fluid,</b> when particles are not too small or too large. Neutrally buoyant particles, on the other hand, have no influence on the critical Reynolds number. Non-modal analysis investigates the transient growth of disturbances, before the subsequent exponential behavior takes over. We investigate the kinetic energy growth of a disturbance, which can grow two to three orders of magnitude for <b>clean</b> <b>fluid</b> channel flows. This transient growth is usually the phenomenon that causes transition to turbulence: the energy can grow such that secondary instabilities and turbulence occurs. The total kinetic energy of a flow increases when particles {{are added to the}} flow {{as a function of the}} particle mass fraction. But instead of only investigating the total energy growth, the non-modal analysis is expanded such that we can differentiate between fluid and particle energy growth. When only the fluid is considered in a particle-laden flow, the transient growth is equal to the transient growth of a <b>clean</b> <b>fluid.</b> Besides thes Stokes drag, added mass and fluid acceleration, this thesis also discusses the influence of the Basset history term. This term is often neglected in stability analyses due to its arguably weak effect, but also due to difficulties in implementation. To implement the term correctly, the history of the particle has to be known. To overcome this and obtain a tractable problem, the square root in the history term is approximated by an exponential. It is found that the history force as a small effect on the transient growth. Finally, Direct numerical simulations are performed for flows with heavy particles to investigate the influence of particles on secondary instabilities. The threshold energy for two routes to turbulence is considered to investigate whether the threshold energy changes when particles are included. We show that particles influence secondary instabilities and particles may delay transition. QC 2011101...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Compact and micro-heat {{exchangers}} {{have many}} advantages over their larger counterparts, particularly when used to handle <b>clean</b> <b>fluid</b> streams, either single- or two-phase.

In the case of heat pumping equipment – the most common examples being air-water or air-air vapour compression cycle heat pumps for domestic heating – this manifests itself in an increased Coefficient of Performance (COP) that reduces CO 2 emissions due to a lower energy input needed to drive the compressor.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} problem of MHD {{boundary}} layer flow and heat transfer of an electrically conducting dusty fluid over an unsteady stretching surface through a non-Darcy porous medium. The flow in porous medium is described by employing the Darcy–Forchheimer based model. The unsteadiness in the flow and temperature fields are because of time-dependent stretching velocity and surface temperature. The effect of thermal radiation, viscous dissipation and non-uniform heat source/sink are also taken into account. The pertinent time-dependent equations, governing the flow and heat transfer are reduced into a set of non-linear ordinary differential equations {{with the aid of}} suitable similarity transformations. The transformed equations are numerically integrated using fourth–fifth order Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg method. The effects of various physical parameters on the velocity and temperature profiles of both phases are analyzed through several plots. Obtained numerical results are compared and found to be in good agreement with previously published results as special cases of the present investigation. It is found that, by suspending fine dust particles in the <b>clean</b> <b>fluid</b> reduces the thermal boundary layer thickness.

40|$|To expand {{investigations}} into the phylogenetic diversity of microorganisms inhabiting the subseafloor biosphere, basalt-hosted crustal fluids were sampled from Circulation Obviation Retrofit Kits affixed to Holes 1025 C and 1026 B along the Juan de Fuca Ridge flank using a <b>clean</b> <b>fluid</b> pumping system. These boreholes penetrate the crustal aquifer of young ocean crust (1. 24 and 3. 51 million years old, respectively), but differ with respect to borehole depth and temperature at the sediment-basement interface (147 meters and 39 ºC vs. 295 meters and 64 ºC, respectively). Cloning and sequencing of PCR-amplified small subunit ribosomal RNA genes revealed that fluids retrieved from Hole 1025 C were dominated by relatives of the genus Desulfobulbus of the Deltaproteobacteria (56 % of clones) and Candidatus Desulforudis of the Firmicutes (17 %). Fluids sampled from Hole 1026 B also contained plausible deep subseafloor inhabitants amongst the most abundant clone lineages; however, both geochemical analysis and microbial community structure reveal the borehole to be compromised by bottom seawater intrusion. Regardless, this study provides independent support for previous observations seeking to identify phylogenetic groups of microorganisms common to the deep ocean crustal biosphere, and extends previous observations by identifying additional lineages that may be prevalent in this unique environment...|$|E

30|$|This letter has {{proposed}} {{a model for the}} main generic features of the channels with nanostructured inner walls with respect to trapping and accumulation of impurities carried by fluids. This includes, e.g., their capability to <b>clean</b> the <b>fluid</b> from impurities of a size much smaller than the channels’ nominal radius, with comparatively small resistance to flow (much smaller than in conventional channels with a radius as small as the impurities). The model attributes the enhanced filtration capability to the long-range attraction exerted by the exposed charges in the nanostructured walls and also to their binding capability once the impurities actually collide with them. Both features were quantitatively accounted for by means of a phenomenological ‘effective-charge density’ of the nanostructured wall. The model also predicts the time evolution of the trapped impurity concentration and of the filtering capability, including three successive regimes: a linear regime, a logarithmic regime, and the saturated limit.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{equilibrium}} {{position of a}} spherical air bubble in a solid body rotating flow around a horizontal axis is investigated experimentally. The flow without bubbles is checked to be solid body rotating. The area of influence of the bubble is characterized to determine for each bubble whether the incoming flow is perturbed or not. The demineralized water used is shown to Tbe contaminated, and spinning of the bubble's interface is observed and measured. From the measurement of the bubble's {{equilibrium position}}, drag and lift coefficients are determined. They appear {{to be dependent on}} two dimensionless numbers. Eo the E ̈tv ̈s number and Rω the rotational Reynolds o o number (or Taylor number Ta) can be varied independently by changing the control parameters, and for that reason are the convenient choice for experiments. (Re, Ro) with Ro the Rossby number is an equivalent choice generally adopted in the literature for numerical simulations, and Re denotes the Reynolds number. When using this second representation, the Ro number appears to be an indicator of the influence on the force coefficients of the shear, of the curvature of the streamlines of the flow and of the bubble's spinning. The bubble's spinning effect on the lift force is far from trivial. Its contribution explains the important gap between lift values for a bubble (not spinning) in a <b>clean</b> <b>fluid</b> and for a bubble (spinning) in a contaminated fluid as present...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{our study}} for in-process optical {{measurement}} of surface profiles, a <b>clean</b> <b>fluid</b> beam {{has been proposed}} for use to remove the coolant fluid to create an optical measurement region. In this process, the mixed fluid will be produced under certain conditions. Due to the mixture, laser beam propagations will be affected, and measurement errors occur. In this project, the optical characteristics of laser beam passing through coolant fluid of various concentrations were examined {{through a series of}} experimental tests. The effects of the coolant fluid layer thicknesses were also tested. It was found that a low concentration coolant could also cause significant measurement errors, if the layer thickness was too large. In addition, if the thickness was less than 0. 3 mm and the coolant concentration less than 1 %, the measurement error may be acceptable. The experimental investigation demonstrated the need for a transparent window for in-process optical measurement, since in practice the concentration of the coolant fluid is normally higher than 1 %. The investigation also shows that the coolant contamination in the transparent region should be controlled to a minimum. The errors {{may be due to the}} cell lens effect of the coolant, in addition to the effect of diffusion. For this, further testing will be needed. To reduce the error for high precision, an error correction algorithm may be used. The findings should be very useful for the in-process optical measurement investigation...|$|E

50|$|Drilling {{through the}} brittle ice zone {{typically}} results in poorer quality core samples {{than for the}} rest of the core. Some steps can be taken to alleviate the problem. Liners can be placed inside the drill barrel to enclose the core before it is brought to the surface, but this makes it difficult to <b>clean</b> drilling <b>fluid</b> from the core. In mineral drilling, equipment is available to bring core samples to the surface at bottom-hole pressure, but this requires machinery that is cost-prohibitive for ice cores given the inaccessible locations of most drilling sites. Keeping the core processing facilities at very low temperatures to limit the thermal shock to the core helps reduce breakage. Cores are susceptible to breaking when being cut at the surface, so another approach is to break the cores to 1 m lengths in the hole, to avoid the need for surface cutting at the lower pressure. Extruding the core into a net as it is recovered from the drill barrel helps keep the core together if it shatters at the surface. Brittle cores are also often allowed to rest in storage at the drill site for some time, for up to a full year between drilling seasons, in order to let the ice gradually relax.|$|R
