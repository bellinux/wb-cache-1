5|$|Enforcement of the HOS is {{generally}} handled by DOT officers of each state, and are sometimes checked when CMVs pass through weigh stations. Drivers {{found to be}} {{in violation of the}} HOS can be forced to stop driving for a <b>certain</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> which may negatively affect the motor carrier's safety rating. Requests to change the HOS are a source of contentious debate, and many surveys indicate some drivers get away with routinely violating the HOS. These facts have started another debate on whether motor carriers should be required to use ELDs in their vehicles, instead of relying on paper-based log books.|$|E
5|$|Once formed, {{proteins}} only {{exist for}} a <b>certain</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and are then degraded and recycled by the cell's machinery {{through the process}} of protein turnover. A protein's lifespan is measured in terms of its half-life and covers a wide range. They can exist for minutes or years with an average lifespan of 1–2 days in mammalian cells. Abnormal or misfolded proteins are degraded more rapidly either due to being targeted for destruction or due to being unstable.|$|E

5|$|The major {{obstacle}} preventing full New London service is the {{bridge over the}} Connecticut River between Old Saybrook and Old Lyme. The drawbridge section is closed for a <b>certain</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to allow trains to pass, which prevents large boats from passing under. The Marine Trades Association opposes additional service, which would mandate more bridge closings. The 2003 agreement with Amtrak limited weekday traffic over the bridge to 2 SLE and 39 Amtrak trains until 2018, although it was revised in 2010 and 2013. Since 2003, New London had been served by cross-honored Amtrak trains plus one or two dedicated SLE roundtrips.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{format for}} the World Championship {{features}} 16 {{teams in the}} championship group, 12 teams in Division I and 12 teams in Division II. If {{there are more than}} 40 teams, the rest compete in Division III. The teams in the championship play a preliminary round, then the top eight teams play in the playoff medal round and the winning team is crowned World Champion. Over the years, the tournament has gone through several rule changes. In 1969 body-checking in all three zones in a rink was allowed, helmets and goaltender masks became mandatory in the early 1970s and in 1992 the IIHF began using the shootout. The current IIHF rules differ slightly from the rules used in the NHL. The World Championships have been open to all players, both professional and amateur, since 1977. The IIHF requires that players are citizens of the country they represent and allow players to switch national teams provided that they play in their new nation for a <b>certain</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tigranes, who was {{residing}} at Tigranocerta in {{the summer}} of 69, was not only astonished by the speed of Lucullus' rapid advance into Armenia but {{by the fact that he}} had even launched such an operation in the first place. Unable to reconcile with this reality for a <b>certain</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> he belatedly sent a general named Mithrobarzanes with 2,000 to 3,000 cavalrymen to slow down Lucullus' advance but his forces were cut to pieces and routed by the 1,600 cavalry led by Sextilius, one of the legates serving under Lucullus. Learning of Mithrobarzanes' defeat, Tigranes entrusted the defense of his namesake city to Mancaeus and left to recruit a fighting force in the Taurus Mountains. Nevertheless, Lucullus' legates were able to disrupt two separate detachments coming to the aid of Tigranes and even located and engaged the king's forces in a canyon in the Taurus. Lucullus, nevertheless, chose not to pursue Tigranes while he had an unimpeded path towards Tigranocerta; he advanced and began to lay siege to it.|$|E
