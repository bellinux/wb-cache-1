5|$|Doxorubicin {{and several}} <b>chemotherapeutic</b> drugs (including cyclophosphamide) cause dyspigmentation. Other groups {{of drugs that}} cause this problem include antimalarials, amiodarone, heavy metals (but not iron), tetracyclines, and antipsychotics.|$|E
5|$|The {{reaction}} {{has been}} used in a number of notable total syntheses including the Danishefsky Taxol total synthesis, which produces the <b>chemotherapeutic</b> drug taxol, and the Kuehne Strychnine total synthesis which produces the pesticide strychnine.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{experimental}} therapies for endometrial cancer under research, including immunologic, hormonal, and <b>chemotherapeutic</b> treatments. Trastuzumab (Herceptin), an antibody against the Her2 protein, {{has been used}} in cancers known to be positive for the Her2/neu oncogene, but research is still underway. Immunologic therapies are also under investigation, particularly in uterine papillary serous carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Hemorrhagic cystitis, {{characterized}} by {{blood in the}} urine, can occur secondary {{to a number of}} causes including: infections, radiation therapy, underlying cancer, medications and toxins. Medications that commonly cause this problem include the <b>chemotherapeutic</b> agent cyclophosphamide with rates of 2 to 40%. Eosinophilic cystitis is a rare condition where eosinophiles are present in the bladder wall. Signs and symptoms are similar to a bladder infection. Its cause is not entirely clear; however, it may be linked to food allergies, infections, and medications among others.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, before antibiotics, {{patients}} with tertiary syphilis were intentionally infected with malaria to induce a fever; this was called malariotherapy. In 1917, Julius Wagner-Jauregg, a Viennese psychiatrist, began to treat neurosyphilitics with induced Plasmodium vivax malaria. Three or four bouts of fever were enough to kill the temperature-sensitive syphilis bacteria (Spirochaeta pallida also known as Treponema pallidum). P. vivax infections were then terminated by quinine. By accurately controlling the fever with quinine, the effects of both syphilis and malaria could be minimized. While about 15% of patients died from malaria, this was preferable to the almost-certain death from syphilis. Therapeutic malaria opened up a wide field of <b>chemotherapeutic</b> research and was practised until 1950. Wagner-Jauregg was awarded the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of the therapeutic value of malaria inoculation {{in the treatment of}} dementia paralytica.|$|E
5|$|Preterm newborns {{are known}} to be at higher risk for bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} with extended exposure to high concentrations of oxygen. Other groups at higher risk for oxygen toxicity are patients on mechanical ventilation with exposure to levels of oxygen greater than 50%, and patients exposed to chemicals that increase risk for oxygen toxicity such the <b>chemotherapeutic</b> agent bleomycin. Therefore, current guidelines for patients on mechanical ventilation in intensive care recommends keeping oxygen concentration less than 60%. Likewise, divers who undergo treatment of decompression sickness are at increased risk of oxygen toxicity as treatment entails exposure to long periods of oxygen breathing under hyperbaric conditions, in addition to any oxygen exposure during the dive.|$|E
25|$|Camptosar (irinotecan) {{for cancer}} and <b>Chemotherapeutic</b> agents.|$|E
25|$|Cisplatin – Also a <b>chemotherapeutic</b> drug.|$|E
25|$|Dexamethasone is {{also used}} as a direct <b>chemotherapeutic</b> agent in certain {{haematological}} malignancies, especially {{in the treatment of}} multiple myeloma, in which dexamethasone is given alone or in combination with other <b>chemotherapeutic</b> drugs, including most commonly with thalidomide (Thal-dex), lenalidomide, bortezomib (Velcade, Vel-dex), or a combination of doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and vincristine or bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone.|$|E
25|$|Electrochemotherapy is the {{combined}} treatment in which injection of a <b>chemotherapeutic</b> drug {{is followed by}} application of high-voltage electric pulses locally to the tumor. The treatment enables the <b>chemotherapeutic</b> drugs, which otherwise cannot or hardly go through the membrane of cells (such as bleomycin and cisplatin), to enter the cancer cells. Hence, greater effectiveness of antitumor treatment is achieved.|$|E
25|$|Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) – A <b>chemotherapeutic</b> drug. This drug {{has been}} shown to potentiate {{cytotoxicity}} during HBO therapy.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, {{arsenic oxide}} is an {{approved}} and effective <b>chemotherapeutic</b> drug {{for the treatment}} of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} to suggest that higher levels of MT expression may also lead to resistance to <b>chemotherapeutic</b> drugs.|$|E
25|$|Somatic {{stem cells}} are {{naturally}} resistant to <b>chemotherapeutic</b> agents. They produce various pumps (such as MDR) that pump out drugs and DNA repair proteins. They have a slow rate of cell turnover (<b>chemotherapeutic</b> agents naturally target rapidly replicating cells). CSCs that develop from normal stem cells may also produce these proteins, which could increase their resistance towards chemotherapy. The surviving CSCs then repopulate the tumor, causing a relapse.|$|E
25|$|Induction {{chemotherapy}} is {{the first}} line treatment of cancer with a <b>chemotherapeutic</b> drug. This type of chemotherapy is used for curative intent.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous {{high-dose}} ascorbate {{is being}} used as a <b>chemotherapeutic</b> and biological response modifying agent. Currently it is still under clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|Bleomycin (a <b>chemotherapeutic</b> agent) and {{possibly}} taxane chemotherapy may cause scleroderma, and occupational exposure to solvents {{has been linked}} with {{an increased risk of}} systemic sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|Specific <b>chemotherapeutic</b> {{agents are}} {{associated}} with organ-specific toxicities, including cardiovascular disease (e.g., doxorubicin), interstitial lung disease (e.g., bleomycin) and occasionally secondary neoplasm (e.g., MOPP therapy for Hodgkin's disease).|$|E
25|$|Maintenance {{treatments}} with <b>chemotherapeutic</b> {{drugs to}} prevent disease recurrence once remission has been achieved. Maintenance therapy usually involves lower drug doses, and may continue {{for up to}} three years.|$|E
25|$|Virtually all <b>chemotherapeutic</b> regimens {{can cause}} {{depression}} of the immune system, often by paralysing the bone marrow and leading to a decrease of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.|$|E
25|$|The enantiomers of perillyl alcohol {{have been}} {{investigated}} for their potential activities as <b>chemotherapeutic</b> agents, {{but there is no}} evidence for efficacy or regulatory approval for such clinical application as of 2017.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{strategies}} in the administration of <b>chemotherapeutic</b> drugs used today. Chemotherapy may be given with a curative intent or it may aim to prolong life or to palliate symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Once a tumor {{has been}} established, {{elevated}} levels of glutathione may act to protect cancerous cells by conferring resistance to <b>chemotherapeutic</b> drugs. The antineoplastic mustard drug canfosfamide was modelled {{on the structure of}} glutathione.|$|E
25|$|Ionizing {{radiation}} levels {{given to}} a woman during cancer treatment cause miscarriage. Exposure can also impact fertility. The use of <b>chemotherapeutic</b> drugs used to treat childhood cancer {{increases the risk of}} miscarriage.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of {{aggressive}} prostate cancers may involve surgery (i.e. radical prostatectomy), radiation therapy including brachytherapy (prostate brachytherapy) and external beam radiation therapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), chemotherapy, oral <b>chemotherapeutic</b> drugs (Temozolomide/TMZ), cryosurgery, hormonal therapy, or some combination.|$|E
25|$|Role of Thy-1 in {{fibrosis}} and fibroblast differention {{may have}} some tissue variation. In lung fibrosis Thy-1 level is suppressed in stimulated fibroblasts. Thy1 knock out mice have increased fibrosis in the lung. Fibrosis induced by radiation mimicking <b>chemotherapeutic</b> agent Bleomycin is also increased in these mice.|$|E
25|$|Female {{infertility}} by chemotherapy {{appears to}} be secondary to premature ovarian failure by loss of primordial follicles. This loss {{is not necessarily a}} direct effect of the <b>chemotherapeutic</b> agents, but could be due to an increased rate of growth initiation to replace damaged developing follicles.|$|E
25|$|Several {{examples}} are noteworthy. Many <b>chemotherapeutic</b> agents cause profound {{suppression of the}} bone marrow. This is reversible, but takes time to recover. Support with platelet and red-cell transfusions as well as broad-spectrum antibiotics in case of infection during this period is crucial to allow the patient to recover.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{intravenous}} methods of drug delivery, known as vascular access devices. These include the winged infusion device, peripheral venous catheter, midline catheter, peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), {{central venous catheter}} and implantable port. The devices have different applications regarding duration of chemotherapy treatment, method of delivery and types of <b>chemotherapeutic</b> agent.|$|E
25|$|Cardiotoxicity (heart damage) is {{especially}} prominent {{with the use}} of anthracycline drugs (doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, and liposomal doxorubicin). The cause of this is most likely due to the production of free radicals in the cell and subsequent DNA damage. Other <b>chemotherapeutic</b> agents that cause cardiotoxicity, but at a lower incidence, are cyclophosphamide, docetaxel and clofarabine.|$|E
25|$|Quantifying {{vasculature}} parameters such as microvascular density has various complications due to {{preferential staining}} or limited representation of tissues by histological sections. Recent {{research has shown}} complete 3D reconstruction of tumor vascular structure and quantification of vessel structures in whole tumors in animal models. This {{has been applied to}} assessing effects of <b>chemotherapeutic</b> drugs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chemotherapeutic</b> {{techniques}} have {{a range of}} side-effects that depend on the type of medications used. The most common medications affect mainly the fast-dividing cells of the body, such as blood cells and the cells lining the mouth, stomach, and intestines. Chemotherapy-related toxicities can occur acutely after administration, within hours or days, or chronically, from weeks to years.|$|E
25|$|Clonal T-cell {{expansion}} in RCD2 is not manageable with steroids (see: RCD 1) and sometimes manageable with <b>chemotherapeutic</b> drugs, however, more aggressive therapies seem more affective. A {{high percentage of}} RCD 2 patients spontaneously develop lymphoma (EATL), the 5 year survival rate is markedly lower than RCD1 but higher than lymphoma. DQ2.5/DQ2 individuals are more frequently found.|$|E
25|$|Norfloxacin is a {{synthetic}} <b>chemotherapeutic</b> antibacterial agent {{that belongs to}} the class of fluoroquinolone antibiotics. It is used to treat urinary tract infections, gynecological infections, inflammation of the prostate gland, gonorrhea and bladder infection. Eye drops were approved for use in children older than one year of age. It is sold under the brand name Noroxin.|$|E
25|$|When {{treating}} infection, whether bacterial or viral, {{there is}} always a risk of the infectious agent to develop drug resistance. The treatment of HIV infection is especially susceptible to drug resistance which is a serious clinical concern in the <b>chemotherapeutic</b> treatment of the infection. Drug resistant HIV-strains emerge if the virus is able to replicate {{in the presence of the}} antiretroviral drugs.|$|E
25|$|Conjugated {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{are joined}} to another molecule, which is either cytotoxic or radioactive. The toxic chemicals are those typically used as chemotherapy drugs, but other toxins can be used. The antibody binds to specific antigens on cancer cell surfaces, directing the therapy to the tumor. Radioactive compound-linked antibodies {{are referred to}} as radiolabelled. Chemolabelled or immunotoxins antibodies are tagged with <b>chemotherapeutic</b> molecules or toxins, respectively.|$|E
