50|$|Reflective foil, bubble foil insulations, and radiant {{barriers}} are noted {{for their ability}} to reflect unwanted solar radiation in hot climates, when applied properly. Reflective foils are fabricated from aluminum foils with a variety of backings such as roofing paper, craft paper, plastic film, polyethylene bubbles, or cardboard. Reflective bubble foil is basically a plastic bubble wrap sheet with a reflective foil layer and belongs to a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> products known as radiant foils. Reflective bubble/foil insulations are primarily radiant barriers, and reflective insulation systems work by reducing radiant heat gain. To be effective, the reflective surface must face an air space, also dust accumulation on the reflective surface will reduce its reflective capability. The radiant barrier should be installed in a manner to minimize dust accumulation on the reflective surface.|$|E
40|$|To {{protect their}} {{policies}} from coalitional drift, legislators seek to insulate agencies from future political interference with design choices that restrict discretion. However, I argue that certain insulation mechanisms, what I {{refer to as}} shielding devices, do not necessarily restrict discretion but may enhance agency expertise and flexibility. I consider {{the implications of this}} different <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> devices on legislators ’ use of design to respond to political uncertainty. I argue that the legislative use of shielding devices is conditioned by the expectation of asymmetric policy costs that particular ideological coalitions expect to bear. I test this argument with original agency design data on U. S. state environmental agencies. I find that conservative coalitions prefer shielding devices only when political uncertainty is high. Political uncertainty does not influence liberal coalitions ' preferences over shielding devices...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the validation of a first-order winding thermal model in machine operative conditions. The proposed {{model can be}} used in motor control strategies for the winding temperature prediction during transient overload or viceversa, for the prediction of the maximum time duration of the overload maintaining the winding temperature within the limit imposed by the <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>insulation.</b> The thermal model has been validated using two different electrical machines. The first one is a 10 kW automotive starter-generator prototype for mini-hybrid powertrain equipped with distributed bar windings, while the second one is a 2. 2 kW total enclosed fan cooled industrial induction motor equipped with conventional stranded wire windings. To both machines it is mainly required a short-duty transient operation in overload conditions. In particular, the automotive starter-generator must accomplish the engine cranking and torque assistance during the vehicle acceleration and braking, while the considered industrial induction machine has to operate in intermittent service in overload conditions for machine tool applications. As a consequence, an accurate stator winding temperature prediction is mandatory to fully exploit the machine performance. For both motors, the thermal model parameters have been evaluated by fast experimental approach and subsequently, the model has been validated during operative overload conditions...|$|E
40|$|Combined {{radiation}} and conduction heat transfer through various high-temperature, high-porosity, unbonded (loose) fibrous insulations was modeled based on first principles. The diffusion approximation {{was used for}} modeling the radiation component of heat transfer in the optically thick insulations. The relevant parameters needed for the heat transfer model were derived from experimental data. Semi-empirical formulations were used to model the solid conduction contribution of heat transfer in fibrous insulations with the relevant parameters inferred from thermal conductivity measurements at cryogenic temperatures in a vacuum. The specific extinction coefficient for radiation heat transfer was obtained from high-temperature steady-state thermal measurements with large temperature gradients maintained across the sample thickness in a vacuum. Standard gas conduction modeling {{was used in the}} heat transfer formulation. This heat transfer modeling methodology was applied to silica, two types of alumina, and a zirconia-based fibrous insulation, and to a variation <b>of</b> opacified fibrous <b>insulation</b> (OFI). OFI is a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>insulations</b> manufactured by embedding efficient ceramic opacifiers in various unbonded fibrous insulations to significantly attenuate the radiation component of heat transfer. The heat transfer modeling methodology was validated by comparison with more rigorous analytical solutions and with standard thermal conductivity measurements. The validated heat transfer model is applicable to various densities <b>of</b> these high-porosity <b>insulations</b> as long as the fiber properties are the same (index of refraction, size distribution, orientation, and length). Furthermore, the heat transfer data for these insulations can be obtained at any static pressure in any working gas environment without the need to perform tests in various gases at various pressures...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. The aim of {{this study}} is to qualitatively assess the {{insulation}} system's condition of medium voltage induction motors. In essence this aim of the research was to analyse and classify the data. The initial step was to understand the data. The literature review gives the background of the insulation system and the different tests done and its interpretations. The research methodology used has been explained along with description of the data. The aging of the insulation is a wide and complex topic, thus in this research the electrical aspects of the insulation were looked into and explained in detail. The data and the limitations of this study are also discussed. Data mining processes were used to gain insight into the data and the condition of the insulation system. The different stages of data mining are explained. The different stages are: identifying the problem, &tC 1 understanding, data preparation and data analysis. An analysis was done using self-organizing maps, which is an unsupervised neural network technique. Hierarchical and K-mean clustering techniques were used to classify the data. The results of the different techniques were compared to an expert's assessment. The study is was an attempt to understand the condition of the insulation system and to classify the data according to its condition. A comparison was done between the different techniques used. The data was divided into four groups based on the voltage rating and <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> used in the motors. Good classification was obtained for three out of the four groups of data. In conclusion, the patterns in the different features of the data due to ageing were observed. The data was qualitatively assessed and classified into groups according to the deterioration of the insulation system using the classification techniques. Finally the results correlated well with the expert's assessment. In essence, the goals set for the research were achieved. Master...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{its high}} {{specific}} energy content, liquid hydrogen (LH 2) {{is emerging as}} an alternative fuel for future aircraft. As a result, {{there is a need}} for hydrogen tank storage systems, for these aircraft applications, that are expected to provide sufficient capacity for flight durations ranging from a few minutes to several days. It is understood that the development of a large, lightweight, reusable cryogenic liquid storage tank is crucial to meet the goals of and supply power to hydrogen-fueled aircraft, especially for long flight durations. This report provides an annotated review (including the results of an extensive literature review) of the current state of the art of cryogenic tank materials, structural designs, and insulation systems along with the identification of key challenges with the intent of developing a lightweight and long-term storage system for LH 2. The broad <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> systems reviewed include foams (including advanced aerogels) and multilayer insulation (MLI) systems with vacuum. The MLI systems show promise for long-term applications. Structural configurations evaluated include single- and double-wall constructions, including sandwich construction. Potential wall material candidates are monolithic metals as well as polymer matrix composites and discontinuously reinforced metal matrix composites. For short-duration flight applications, simple tank designs may suffice. Alternatively, for longer duration flight applications, a double-wall construction with a vacuum-based insulation system appears to be the most optimum design. The current trends in liner material development are reviewed in the case that a liner is required to minimize or eliminate the loss of hydrogen fuel through permeation...|$|R
