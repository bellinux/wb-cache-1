25|$|A {{carnivorous}} plant that catches no insects at all will rarely die, although its growth may be impaired.

50|$|On Earth, {{there are}} two known types of basaltic lava: aa and pāhoehoe. Aa lava {{presents}} a rough texture {{in the shape of}} broken blocks (clinkers). Pāhoehoe lava is recognized by its pillowy or ropy appearance. Rough surfaces appear bright in radar images, which can be used to determine the differences between aa and pāhoehoe lavas. These variations can also reflect differences in lava age and preservation. Channels and lava tubes (channels that have cooled down and over which a dome has formed) are very <b>common</b> on <b>Venus.</b> Two planetary astronomers from the University of Wollongong in Australia, Dr Graeme Melville and Prof. Bill Zealey, researched these lava tubes, using data supplied by NASA, {{over a number of years}} and concluded that they were widespread and up to ten times the size of those on the Earth. Melville and Zealey said that the gigantic size of the Venusian lava tubes (tens of meters wide and hundreds of kilometers long) may be explained by the very fluid lava flows together with the high temperatures on Venus, allowing the lava to cool slowly.|$|R

40|$|Explosive {{volcanism}} on Venus {{is severely}} inhibited by its high atmospheric pressure {{and lack of}} water. This paper shows that a deposit located near 16 °S, 144 °E, here referred to as Scathach Fluctus, displays a number of morphological characteristics consistent with a pyroclastic flow deposit. These characteristics, particularly its lack of channelisation and evidence for momentum rather than cooling limited flow length, contrast with fissure-fed lava flow deposits. The total erupted volume is estimated to have been between 225 km 3 and 875 km 3 but {{this may have been}} emplaced in more than one event. Interaction between Scathach Fluctus and a small volcanic cone constrain the flow velocity to 48 m s− 1 and plausible volatile concentrations to at least 1 · 8 wt% H 2 O, 4 · 3 wt% CO 2 or 6 · 1 wt% SO 2, the latter two implying magma sourced directly from the mantle. The deposit has radar characteristics, particularly an exponential backscatter function, that {{are similar to those of}} nearly half the planetary surface, implying that pyroclastic deposits may be much more <b>common</b> on <b>Venus</b> than has been recognised to date, and suggesting both a relatively volatile-rich mantle and a volcanic source for atmospheric SO 2...|$|R

40|$|Coronae {{are large}} quasi-circular geologica {{features}} that are <b>common</b> on <b>Venus.</b> They {{appear to be the}} surface tectonic and volcanic expressions of mantle diapirs that have impinged {{on the underside of the}} venusian lithosphere. We have investigated the spatial distribution of 335 coronae and related features identified in Magellan radar data. It is more clustered than a Poisson distribution, with a statistical certainty of more than 99 %. It is dominated by a single large cluster centered near the equator at about 245 deg longitude. The features are preferentially found at elevation and geoid values close to the planetary mean, with a paucity at both the highest and lowest levels of topgraphy and geoid. Some coronae appear aligned in quasi-linear chains. We attribute the clustering of coronae and related features to preferential formation of these features above regions of broad-scale mantle upwelling, and suggest that a major mantle upwelling underlies the one large cluster. We suggest that coronae are rare at the lowest elevations because these may be regions of mantle downwelling. The shortage of coronae at the highest elevations may result both from obscuration by other intense tectonism there and from suppression there of their formation by an unusually thick crust. Corona chains may be produced by enhanced passive mantle uplift below failed or incipient rifts...|$|R
50|$|Several space probes {{en route}} to other {{destinations}} have used flybys of Venus to increase their speed via the gravitational slingshot method. These include the Galileo mission to Jupiter and the Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn (two flybys). Rather curiously, during Cassinis examination of the radio frequency emissions of Venus with its radio and plasma wave science instrument during both the 1998 and 1999 flybys, it reported no high-frequency radio waves (0.125 to 16 MHz), which are commonly associated with lightning. This was in direct opposition {{to the findings of}} the Soviet Venera missions 20 years earlier. It was postulated that perhaps if Venus did have lightning, it might be some type of low-frequency electrical activity, because radio signals cannot penetrate the ionosphere at frequencies below about 1 megahertz. At the University of Iowa, Donald Gurnetts examination of Venuss radio emissions by the Galileo spacecraft during its flyby in 1990 were interpreted at the time to be indicative of lightning. However the Galileo probe was over 60 times further from Venus than Cassini was during its flyby, making its observations substantially less significant. The mystery {{as to whether or not}} Venus does in fact have lightning in its atmosphere was not solved until 2007, when the scientific journal Nature published a series of papers giving the initial findings of Venus Express. It confirmed the presence of lightning on Venus and that it is more <b>common</b> on <b>Venus</b> than it is on Earth.|$|R
40|$|Regional slope {{values for}} earth and Venus are {{calculated}} for each 3 ø x 3 ø region of topography, and the global characteristics of these magnitudes are examined and compared. The effects on terrestrial regional slope due to ocean loading are treated by approximating the component of seafloor depth due to {{the weight of the}} overlying water column and removing this component from the ocean topography. Although regional slopes on Venus and earth span the same range, 0. 00 - 2. 4 ø (+ 0. 07 ø), the slope fre-quency distributions for the two planets differ significantly. The most abundant regional slope values for the terrestrial cases (earth and unloaded earth) are 0. 0 ø and reflect the presence of vast plains associated with the continental interiors and ocean abyssal plain•. In contrast, Venus exhibits a peak in slope frequency at approximately 0. 09 ø, perhaps indicating less effective planation processes {{in the absence of a}} hydrosphere. Surfaces with regional slope values of 0. 07 ø- 0. 24 ø are substantially more <b>common</b> on <b>Venus</b> than on earth. Slopes in this range are associated with discrete features in the lowland and upland rolling plains provinces of Venus and may be indicative of a geologic process that is not commonly observed on earth. Only 14 + 1 % of all Venus surfaces have regional slopes above 0. 24 ø, compared to 26 + 1 % for earth. When mean regional slope is calculated as a function of elevation, a distinctive positive correlation is expressed on Venus. In contrast, the terrestrial cases exhibit a complex relationship marked by four modes related to the presence on earth of an active hydrosphere-driven weathering regime, a distinctive crustal dichotomy, and plate tectonics. The distinctions in the regional slope characteristics between Venus and earth point to a simpler, less diversified geology on Venus...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} and deployment of sensors for undersea cabled observatories is presently biased toward {{the measurement of}} habitat variables, while sensor technologies for biological community characterization through species identification and individual counting are less <b>common.</b> The <b>VENUS</b> cabled multisensory network (Vancouver Island, Canada) deploys seafloor camera systems at several sites. Our objective {{in this study was}} to implement new automated image analysis protocols for the recognition and counting of benthic decapods (i. e., the galatheid squat lobster, Munida quadrispina), {{as well as for the}} evaluation of changes in bacterial mat coverage (i. e., Beggiatoa spp.), using a camera deployed in Saanich Inlet (103 m depth). For the counting of Munida we remotely acquired 100 digital photos at hourly intervals from 2 to 6 December 2009. In the case of bacterial mat coverage estimation, images were taken from 2 to 8 December 2009 at the same time frequency. The automated image analysis protocols for both study cases were created in MatLab 7. 1. Automation for Munida counting incorporated the combination of both filtering and background correction (Median- and Top-Hat Filters) with Euclidean Distances (ED) on Red-Green-Blue (RGB) channels. The Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features and Fourier Descriptors (FD) of tracked objects were then extracted. Animal classifications were carried out with the tools of morphometric multivariate statistic (i. e., Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis; PLSDA) on Mean RGB (RGBv) value for each object and Fourier Descriptors (RGBv+FD) matrices plus SIFT and ED. The SIFT approach returned the better results. Higher percentages of images were correctly classified and lower misclassification errors (an animal is present but not detected) occurred. In contrast, RGBv+FD and ED resulted in a high incidence of records being generated for non-present animals. Bacterial mat coverage was estimated in terms of Percent Coverage and Fractal Dimension. A constant Region of Interest (ROI) was defined and background extraction by a Gaussian Blurring Filter was performed. Image subtraction within ROI was followed by the sum of the RGB channels matrices. Percent Coverage was calculated on the resulting image. Fractal Dimension was estimated using the box-counting method. The images were then resized to a dimension in pixels equal to a power of 2, allowing subdivision into sub-multiple quadrants. In comparisons of manual and automated Percent Coverage and Fractal Dimension estimates, the former showed an overestimation tendency for both parameters. The primary limitations on the automatic analysis of benthic images were habitat variations in sediment texture and water column turbidity. The application of filters for background corrections is a required preliminary step for the efficient recognition of animals and bacterial mat patches...|$|R
40|$|A common way to {{regularize}} mathematical ill-posed retrieval {{problems in}} atmospheric remote sensing is {{the incorporation of}} single-spectrum Bayesian a priori mean values {{and standard deviations for}} the parameters to be retrieved, along with measurement and simulation error information. This decreases the probability to obtain unlikely parameter values. For a reliable evaluation of measurements with sparse spectral information content like Venus' nightside emissions in the infrared as acquired by the VIRTIS-M-IR instrument aboard ESA's Venus Express spacecraft, it can help to consider further a priori knowledge. A new multi-spectrum retrieval technique (MSR) is presented that allows one to incorporate expected correlation lengths and times for the retrieval parameters used to describe several spectra. It is demonstrated by examples that this decreases the probability to retrieve spatial–temporal state vector distributions that are incompatible with these a priori spatial–temporal correlations. Also, a priori correlations between the parameters used to describe a single spectrum and exhibiting similar a priori spatial–temporal behavior, act to rule out unlikely single-spectrum state vectors. Parameters with infinite correlation length or time and identic single-spectrum a priori data are spatially or temporally constant and can be retrieved as parameters that are common to a certain selection of measurements. This is shown to be especially useful to retrieve surface emissivity in the infrared as a parameter that is common to several measurements that repeatedly cover the same target, and to determine deep atmospheric CO 2 opacity corrections, which are <b>common</b> to all <b>Venus</b> nightside spectra. Also this way, all considered measurements can be parameterized by a fully consistent set of atmospheric, surface, and instrumental parameters that respects all available a priori data as well as the measurement and simulation error distributions and that does not neglect the context between adjacent measurements. MSR is demonstrated to enhance the retrieval reliability and accuracy and pushes the VIRTIS-M-IR data evaluation to its limits...|$|R
6000|$|Thus, much - alas! {{how little}} - about {{the wonders of}} the deep. We, who are no deep-sea dredgers, must return humbly to {{the wonders of the}} shore. And first, as after {{descending}} the gap in the sea-wall we walk along the ribbed floor of hard yellow sand, {{let me ask you to}} give a sharp look-out for a round grey disc, about as big as a penny-piece, peeping out on the surface. No; that is not it, that little lump: open it, and you will find within one of the <b>common</b> little <b>Venus</b> gallina. - The closet collectors have given it some new name now, and no thanks to them: they are always changing the names, instead of studying the live animals where Nature has put them, in which case they would have no time for word-inventing. [...] Nay, I verify suspect that the names grow, like other things; at least, they get longer and longer and more jaw-breaking every year. [...] The little bivalve, however, finding itself left by the tide, has wisely shut up its siphons, and, by means of its foot and its edges, buried itself in a comfortable bath of cool wet sand, till the sea shall come back, and make it safe to crawl and lounge about on the surface, smoking the sea-water instead of tobacco. Neither is that depression what we seek. Touch it, and out poke a pair of astonished and inquiring horns: it is a long-armed crab, who saw us coming, and wisely shovelled himself into the sand by means of his nether-end. Corystes Cassivelaunus is his name, which he is said to have acquired from the marks on his back, which are somewhat like a human face. [...] "Those long antennae," [...] says my friend, Mr. Lloyd (6) - I have not verified the fact, but believe it, as he knows a great deal about crabs, and I know next to nothing - [...] "form a tube through which a current of water passes into the crab's gills, free from the surrounding sand." [...] Moreover, it is only the male who has those strangely long fore-arms and claws; the female contenting herself with limbs of a more moderate length. Neither is that, though it might be, the hole down which what we seek has vanished: but that burrow contains one of the long white razors which you saw cast on shore at Paignton. The boys close by are boring for them with iron rods armed with a screw, and taking them in to sell in Torquay market, as excellent food. But there is one, at last - a grey disc pouting up through the sand. Touch it, and it is gone down, quick as light. We must dig it out, and carefully, for it is a delicate monster. At last, after ten minutes' careful work, we have brought up, from a foot depth or more - what? A thick, dirty, slimy worm, without head or tail, form or colour. A slug has more artistic beauty about him. Be it so. At home in the aquarium (where, alas! he will live but for a day or two, under the new irritation of light) he will make a very different figure. That is one of the rarest of British sea- animals, Peachia hastata (Pl. XII. Fig. 1), which differs from most other British Actiniae in this, that instead of having like them a walking disc, it has a free open lower end, with which (I know not how) it buries itself upright in the sand, with its mouth just above the surface. The figure on the left of the plate represents a curious cluster of papillae which project from one side of the mouth, and are the opening of the oviduct. But his value consists, not merely in his beauty (though that, really, is not small), but in his belonging to what the long word-makers call an [...] "interosculant" [...] group, - a party of genera and species which connect families scientifically far apart, filling up a fresh link in the great chain, or rather the great network, of zoological classification. For here we have a simple, and, as it were, crude form; of which, if we dared to indulge in reveries, we might say that the Creative Mind realized it before either Actiniae or Holothurians, and then went on to perfect the idea contained in it in two different directions; dividing it into two different families, and making on its model, by adding new organs, and taking away old ones, in one direction the whole family of Actiniae (sea- anemones), and in a quite opposite one the Holothuriae, those strange sea-cucumbers, with their mouth-fringe of feathery gills, of which you shall see some anon. Thus there has been, in the Creative Mind, as it gave life to new species, a development of the idea on which older species were created, in order - we may fancy - that every mesh of the great net might gradually be supplied, and there should be no gaps in the perfect variety of Nature's forms. [...] This development is one which we must believe to be at least possible, if we allow that a Mind presides over the universe, and not a mere brute necessity, a Law (absurd misnomer) without a Lawgiver; and to it (strangely enough coinciding here and there with the Platonic doctrine of Eternal Ideas existing in the Divine Mind) all fresh inductive discovery seems to point more and more.|$|R
