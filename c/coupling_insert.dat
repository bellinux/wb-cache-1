40|$|Several {{years ago}} we {{demonstrated}} that the Casimir energy for perfectly reflecting and imperfectly reflecting parallel plates gravitated normally, that is, obeyed the equivalence principle. At that time the divergences in the theory were treated only formally, without proper regularization, and the coupling to gravity {{was limited to the}} canonical energy-momentum-stress tensor. Here we strengthen the result by removing both of those limitations. We consider, as a toy model, massless scalar fields interacting with semitransparent (δ-function) potentials defining parallel plates, which become Dirichlet plates for strong <b>coupling.</b> We <b>insert</b> space and time point-split regulation parameters, and obtain well-defined contributions to the self- energy of each plate, and the interaction energy between the plates. (This self-energy does not vanish even in the conformally-coupled, strong-coupled limit.) We also compute the local energy density, which requires regularization near the plates. In general, the energy density includes a surface energy that resides precisely on the boundaries. This energy is also regulated. The gravitational interaction of this well-defined system is then investigated, and it is verified that the equivalence principle is satisfied. Comment: 14 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

The MIMO antenna contains two dual-band antenna elements, {{each of which}} comprises a T-shaped monopole and a special ├-shaped stub resonator. Two operating bands with center frequencies of 5. 5 GHz and 2. 5 GHz are crested by the monopole of T shape and the stub resonator of ├ shape, accordingly. The ├-shaped stub also works as an isolation structure at the higher band, which can simplify the dual-band isolation design into a single-band problem.

Search: 20111122 - 33 The fracture rate of third-generation ceramic liners is greatly reduced compared with fi rst- and second-generation liners because of improvements {{in the design and}} manu-facturing process. Fractures of the alumina-bearing couple are rare for the same reason. This article describes a case of a fracture of an alumina-bearing couple delta ceramic liner without trauma history that was treated with ceramic-on-polyethylene revision to-tal hip arthroplasty. A 57 -year-old man was admitted to the hip ward because of an alumina-bearing couple delta ceramic liner fracture.

Coupling refers to the association between responses and reinforcers.

Contingencies of reinforcement refer to how a reinforcer is scheduled with respect to the target response (Killeen & Sitomer, 2003), and the specific schedules of reinforcement in effect determine how responses are coupled to the reinforcer. The third principle of MPR states that the degree of coupling between a response and reinforcer decreases with the distance between them (Killeen & Sitomer, 2003).

Here the coupling is divided into parts and modeled separately. A particular interest is on the dynamic behavior of the springs. These parts are then joined together. In the next chapter the coupling model is compared to the values given by the manufacturer. It shows that the model is too stiff.

The model is than tested by varying the excitation frequency, the resistance of the load and the inertia of the coupling.

40|$|Summary: The {{bacterial}} cell wall consists of peptidoglycan (PG), a sturdy mesh of glycan strands cross-linked by short peptides. This rigid structure constrains cell shape and size, yet is sufficiently dynamic to accommodate insertion of newly synthesized PG, which was long hypothesized, and recently demonstrated, to require cleavage of the covalent peptide cross-links that <b>couple</b> previously <b>inserted</b> material. Here, we identify several genes in Vibrio cholerae that collectively are required for growth - particularly elongation - of this pathogen. V. cholerae encodes three putative periplasmic proteins, here denoted ShyA, ShyB, and ShyC, that contain both PG binding and M 23 family peptidase domains. While none is essential individually, the absence of both ShyA and ShyC results in synthetic lethality, while the absence of ShyA and ShyB causes a significant growth deficiency. ShyA is a D,d-endopeptidase able to cleave most peptide chain cross-links in V. cholerae'sPG. PG from a {increment}shyA mutant has decreased average chain length, suggesting that ShyA may promote removal of short PG strands. Unexpectedly, ShyA has little activity against muropeptides containing pentapeptides, which typically characterize newly synthesized material. ShyA's substrate-dependent activity may contribute to selection of cleavage sites in PG, whose implications for the process of side-wall growth are discussed. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

The most successful method was found to be that using the enzyme mixture papain, prolidase and aminopeptidase-M, which together completely hydrolysed the test substrates ovalbumin, BSA and insulin (B chain). A range of enzymes were <b>coupled</b> to <b>insert</b> supports, and although such immobilization simplified handling of the enzymes, the coupled enzymes proved less efficient for proteolysis than their soluble counterparts. Amino acid analysis and SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were used to identify the end products of proteolysis. The use of a pH-stat was found unsuitable for the measurement of proteolysis. In vitro proteolysis was used to study the digestibility of glycoprotein II, purified from Phaseolus vulgaris. Denatured glycoprotein II was fully digested by the enzymic method, although in its native form, the glycoprotein was only partially digested. The digestibility of trypsin inhibitor, purified from Phaseolus vulgaris was also studied. Both in its native form, and after heat treatment, the trypsin inhibitor was poorly hydrolysed. It was also found that native trypsin had some resistance to digestion conferred upon it by the presence of the inhibitor. Active trypsin inhibitor was detected in the faeces of rats whose diet included the inhibitor. The significance of these findings in vitro and in vivo were discussed.

40|$|Diffusion {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{fundamental}} physical phenomena. It relates to the manufacturing of almost all materials. Therefore, the precise knowledge of diffusivities of relevant materials is necessary for the optimization of these processes. On the other hand, such knowledge is indispensable to understanding the diffusion mechanism and structure of liquid metal in the field of physical metallurgy. Many diffusion experiments on solid metal were undertaken and a lot of data were accumulated. But on liquid metals there are few measurements because of experimental difficulties, such as thermal convection, induced by very slight temperature gradients in the specimen. Under microgravity conditions, the movement of liquid metal due to density differences and thermal convection must be suppressed markedly. Therefore, the transportation process will be controlled only by the diffusion of constituent atoms. These conditions offer the optimum environments for the diffusion experiment. The experiments are briefly described. Diffusion couples are prepared by attaching end to end two rods of different pure metals using hot press equipment. These <b>couples</b> are <b>inserted</b> into a graphite crucible and then doubly enclosed by two silica ampoules, respectively. The specimen is inserted into a tantalum cartridge, which is welded in a vacuum using an electron-beam apparatus. These cartridges are charged in the continuous heating furnace in space and held at a given temperature for a predetermined time and then solidified. The concentration distribution of elements in these specimens will be measured along the rod axis by means of an electron probe microanalyzer.

40|$|Hotdog-fold acyl-CoA thioesterases (ACOTs) {{are found}} in all three kingdoms of life (Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya). All the hotdog-fold thioesterases share common {{catalytic}} scaffold and function: hydrolysis of acyl-CoA or acyl-ACP (acyl carrier protein). However the biological roles that they perform vary greatly, different substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency assign unique set of biological functions to each of them, which is further defined by tissue distribution, cellular location, protein partners and regulators. The focuses of my doctoral studies, described in this dissertation, are {{two members of the}} human hotdog-fold thioesterase superfamily: human THEM 4 and human THEM 5. The genes encoding hTHEM 4 and hTHEM 5 are two adjacent brothers in the chromosome 1 q 21. 3. Expression of truncated hTHEM 4 (∆ 39) in E. coli produced a homogenous product. In vitro activity analysis proved that hTHEM 4 is a high activity, broad substrate range, acyl-CoA thioesterase. In addition to hydrolysis of short and long chain acyl-CoAs (kcat/KM value: 104 to 106 M- 1 s- 1), it also catalyzes the hydrolysis of myristoyl-ACP and palmitoyl-ACP. The X-ray structure of hTHEM 4 (∆ 39) bound with an inert fatty acyl-CoA analog revealed that N-terminal domain is two separate helix <b>inserts</b> <b>coupled</b> with a disordered extended loop. In order to understand the relationship between hTHEM 4 and Akt 1, the effect of purified (fl) hTHEM 4 and hTHEM 4 (∆ 39) on the phosphorylation (activation) and activity of full-length and truncated Akt 1 were tested at GlaxoSmithKline. The results showed that (fl) hTHEM 4 has a small but significant direct effect on Akt 1 catalytic activity, and also on Akt 1 activation at both Thr 308 (by PDK 1) and Ser 473 (by mTORC 2). The co-immunoprecipitation experiment was also carried out to investigate the physical association between hTHEM 4 and Akt 1. Taken together, hTHEM 4 and Akt 1 are associated with each other, and the effect (inhibition or activation) is concentration-dependent. The full-length hTHEM 5 was expressed in HEK 293 T cells at a high level compared to that observed for the hTHEM 4. The hTHEM 5 (∆ 40) X-ray structure depicts essentially the same active site observed for hTHEM 4, and no features that we recognize which might explain the difference in expression level in transfected HEK 293 T cells. Interestingly, the in vitro kinetic studies carried out with hTHEM 5 (∆ 40) showed a similar substrate specificity profile, yet a 100 -fold drop in kcat. The cellular location imaging of hTHEM 5 in transfected HEK 293 T cells using hTHEM 5 -GFP and (∆ 32) -hTHEM 5 -GFP fusions showed specific mitochondrial location of hTHEM 5 -GFP and a distributive location of the (∆ 32) -hTHEM 5 -GFP. In parallel with the biological function study, a structure-function analysis of hTHEM 4 and hTHEM 5 mechanisms of catalysis and substrate recognition was also carried out. Structure guided site directed mutagenesis and steady-state kinetic analysis of the purified mutants has been done to identify the enzyme residues that contribute to substrate binding and catalysis.
