5|$|The {{architecture}} of Denmark has {{its origins in}} the Viking period, richly revealed by archaeological finds. It became firmly established in the Middle Ages when first Romanesque, then Gothic churches and cathedrals sprang up throughout the country. It was during this period that, {{in a country with}} little access to stone, brick became the <b>construction</b> <b>material</b> of choice, not just for churches but also for fortifications and castles.|$|E

5|$|Warsaw {{and other}} ruined cities were cleared of rubble — mainly by hand — and rebuilt with great speed (one of {{the successes of}} the Three-Year Plan) {{at the expense of}} former German cities like Wrocław, which often {{provided}} the needed <b>construction</b> <b>material.</b> Wrocław, Gdańsk, Szczecin and other formerly German cities were also completely rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|At Valdez, {{construction}} was two-thirds complete by September as 4,200 workers hurried {{to complete the}} marine terminal. Because of loose soil found at the job site, enormous retaining walls had to be constructed to secure the ground below some of the 58 structures that were completed {{by the end of}} the year. During the first week of November, the first ship docked at the newly built Valdez quays. It was not a tanker but a ship bringing more <b>construction</b> <b>material.</b> In December, the first signal was sent from the Valdez operations center—where two new control computers had been installed—to Pump Station 2 on the North Slope.|$|E
5|$|Dr. John Lescher was a {{business}} partner and friend of Thomas S. Hinde. Both men invested in the Wabash Navigation Company. Lescher later joined Hinde's children in {{a lawsuit against the}} company. Not long after the death of Hinde, his son James and his son-in-law Charles H. Constable joined with Lescher and sued the company for entering their land and taking timber and other materials for the construction of dam. But, the company's charter permitted them to enter the land and take <b>construction</b> <b>material</b> without the owner's consent, forcing the owner to seek legal redress. The court ordered compensation.|$|E
40|$|The work {{examines}} {{the issue of}} radioactivity of <b>construction</b> <b>materials.</b> The introduction deals with the approach to radioactivity from the general and legislative points of view and its origin and division. It briefly mentions units of activity. It further deals {{with the issue of}} radioactivity in <b>construction</b> <b>materials</b> as such, the issue of emerging radon and emanation of <b>construction</b> <b>materials.</b> The second part of the work focuses on extreme cases of use of unsuitable <b>construction</b> raw <b>materials</b> in the building industry {{in the history of the}} Czech Republic, specifically houses in Jáchymov, aerated concrete produced in Poříčí near Trutnov and prefabricated houses START.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the potential use of various solid wastes for producing <b>construction</b> <b>materials.</b> The paper is based on the comprehensive review of available literature on the <b>construction</b> <b>materials</b> including different kinds of solid wastes. The traditional methods for producing <b>construction</b> <b>materials</b> are using the valuable natural resources. Besides, the industrial and urban management systems are generating solid wastes, and most often dumping them in open fields. These activities pose serious detrimental effects on the environment. To safeguard the environment, many efforts are being made for the recycling of different types of solid wastes with a view to utilizing them in the production of various <b>construction</b> <b>materials.</b> This paper discusses the environmental implications caused by the generation of various solid wastes, and highlights their recycling potentials and possible use for producing <b>construction</b> <b>materials.</b> In addition, this paper shows the applications of solid waste based <b>construction</b> <b>materials</b> in real <b>construction,</b> and identifies the research needs...|$|R

5|$|The Ju 87 was a single-engined {{all-metal}} cantilever monoplane. It had a fixed undercarriage {{and could}} carry a two-person crew. The main <b>construction</b> <b>material</b> was duralumin, and the external coverings {{were made of}} Duralumin sheeting. Parts that were required to be of strong construction, such as the wing flaps, were made of Pantal (a German aluminum alloy containing titanium as a hardening element) and its components made of Elektron. Bolts and parts that were required to take heavy stress were made of steel.|$|E
5|$|When the {{building}} {{was transformed into a}} mosque from a cathedral, most of the previous Crusader construction was completely replaced, but the mosque's facade with its arched entrance is a typical piece of Crusader ecclesiastical architecture, and columns within the mosque compound still retain their Italian Gothic style. Some of the columns have been identified as elements of an ancient synagogue, reused as <b>construction</b> <b>material</b> in the Crusader era and still forming part of the mosque. Internally, the wall surfaces are plastered and painted. Marble is used for the western door and the dome's oculus. The floors are covered with glazed tiles. The columns are also marble and their capitals are built in Corinthian style.|$|E
5|$|Fakih's father {{helped him}} become a trader, {{although}} Fakih continued to study independently. When the modernist Islamic organisation Muhammadiyah opened a branch in Gresik in 1922, Fakih {{was one of}} the first to join. Extremely active in the group, he became the Gresik branch's leader within three years, and under his leadership the group was formally recognised by the central Muhammadiyah administration. Through his work with the Muhammadiyah in Gresik, Fakih became better known. He later transferred to the branch in Surabaya, a much larger city where, in 1929, he was chosen to sit on the city council. He also remained active in commerce, running a <b>construction</b> <b>material</b> trade and shipbuilding shop. During this period he served on the local chamber of commerce.|$|E
30|$|Model {{results also}} show that <b>construction</b> <b>materials</b> {{influence}} vertical and earthquake load vulnerability significantly with a parameter value of 0.924 and 0.824, respectively (Table  2). <b>Construction</b> <b>materials</b> have a correlation value of 0.383 (Table  3) and 0.317 (Table  4) for vertical and earthquake load vulnerability, respectively. Vulnerability to vertical and earthquake loads largely depend on the type and characteristics of the <b>construction</b> <b>materials</b> used. The building assessment analysis identifies many cases where both quality of <b>construction</b> <b>materials</b> and <b>construction</b> practices were very poor. Yépez and Yépez (2017) found that substandard <b>construction</b> <b>materials</b> and poor <b>construction</b> practice {{were some of the}} main reasons behind the collapse of thousands of buildings after the Ecuador earthquake in 2016. Bangladesh has not experienced a major earthquake since Great Indian Earthquake 1897 (Roy 2014; Chakravorti et al. 2015). But the country should be careful to maintain its construction quality in order to reduce vertical as well as earthquake load vulnerability to avoid a potential future disastrous situation.|$|R

5|$|Soviet rail {{transport}} became, after the Great Patriotic War, {{one of the}} most developed in the world, surpassing most of its First World counterparts. The Soviet railway system was growing in size, at a rate of 639km a year from 1965 to 1980, while the growth of {{rail transport}} in First World countries was either decreasing or stagnating. This steady growth in rail transport {{can be explained by the}} country's need to extract its natural resources, most of which were located close to, or in Siberia. While some problems with the railways had been reported by the Soviet press, the Soviet Union could boast of controlling {{one of the most}} electrified railway systems at the time. During much of the country's later lifespan, trains usually carried coal, oil, <b>construction</b> <b>material</b> (mostly stone, cement and sand) and timber. Oil and oil products were one of the key reasons for building railway infrastructure in Siberia in the first place.|$|E
5|$|The Inaccessible Island rail is a {{seasonal}} breeder, laying between October and January. They are monogamous, forming permanent pair-bonds. The nests are {{situated at the}} base of ferns with tussock grass, tussock grass clumps, or in tufts of sedges. The nests are domed and oval or pear shaped, with the entrances near the narrow end of the nest and linked by a track or tunnel that can go up to half a metre away. The nests are typically built entirely of the same material the nest is found in; for example, tussock grass or sedges. Where the <b>construction</b> <b>material</b> is tussock grass, larger leaves are used on the outside and finer material lines the nest. There are a few reports of other material being used as lining, such as the leaves of introduced Malus domestica (apple) or Salix babylonica (willow).|$|E
5|$|The {{church was}} {{designed}} in the French Gothic style by French architects including Étienne de Bonneuil. It {{is in the form}} of a cross formed by the nave and transept. Most of the structure was built between 1272 and 1420 but the western end was completed only in the middle of the 15th century. Twin towers were built shortly afterwards on the west end of the church. High spires were added later, but after a fire in 1702, they were adorned with low helms by Carl Hårleman in 1735. They were completely redesigned by Helgo Zetterwall who undertook substantial changes to the building in the 1880s. The cathedral's principal <b>construction</b> <b>material</b> is brick but the pillars and many details are of Gotland limestone.|$|E

5|$|The {{governments of}} Oaxaca and Guerrero asked UNICEF for assistance, {{specifically}} water tanks, water pumps, and <b>construction</b> <b>material.</b> International aid initially focused almost {{solely on the}} damage in Acapulco. By {{a week after the}} hurricane, 500communities in Oaxaca remained isolated and without assistance, with several large communities in Guerrero not receiving any material aid by a week after the hurricane. The Adventist Development and Relief Agency organized about 7tons of food and clothing, and sent a bus of 40people to help isolated villages in southern Mexico. Around ten days after the hurricane struck, 20,000people were still isolated from emergency crews and relief works, causing the president to suspect people could begin starving to death. Helicopters were initially sent to the remote areas, though severe fog and heavy rainfall after the hurricane grounded the operations. The government worked to bring food to remote mountain communities, though officials noted the serious risk in doing so.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Gedi's structures were domestic residences made of thatched-roofed mud buildings concentrated between the outer and inner walls; however, the only buildings that survived {{to the present}} were constructed using coral stones extracted from the Indian Ocean. Although several of the buildings predate the fourteenth century, coral became a more common <b>construction</b> <b>material</b> for important structures and elite residences during that time period. All of the buildings at Gedi are single-story structures. The walls and other coral structures were constructed {{in a similar manner}} using lime mortar, with most foundations no greater than one foot in depth and filled with stones. Where foundations were used, they tended to be no wider than the wall they supported. There are several examples of non-utilitarian design elements. Doorways for the buildings consist of square framed pointed archways, with tombs and mosques containing spandrels and architraves that have been carved or inlaid with porcelain.|$|E
5|$|To {{build their}} nests, {{termites}} primarily use faeces, which have many desirable properties as a <b>construction</b> <b>material.</b> Other building materials include partly digested plant material, used in carton nests (arboreal nests built from faecal elements and wood), and soil, used in subterranean nest and mound construction. Not all nests are visible, as many nests in tropical forests are located underground. Species in the subfamily Apicotermitinae are {{good examples of}} subterranean nest builders, as they only dwell inside tunnels. Other termites live in wood, and tunnels are constructed as they feed on the wood. Nests and mounds protect the termites' soft bodies against desiccation, light, pathogens and parasites, {{as well as providing}} a fortification against predators. Nests made out of carton are particularly weak, and so the inhabitants use counter-attack strategies against invading predators.|$|E

40|$|Fast speed {{construction}} {{development is}} a key contributor to excessive carbon emissions. Apart from the operational emissions of construction facilities, more and more clients and designers {{are concerned about the}} carbon emissions embodied in <b>construction</b> <b>materials.</b> Despite the significance of this, little research has been conducted to reduce the use of <b>construction</b> <b>materials</b> of high carbon intensity. To significantly reduce the carbon emissions due to the use of <b>construction</b> <b>materials,</b> a fundamental rethink of the tendering mechanism is needed. In this paper, a carbon emission encompassed tender is proposed. The fundamental basis of the envisaged carbon emission encompassed tender is a transparent and equitable framework to estimate the carbon footprint of products. With the release of the ISO 14067, {{it is possible that the}} carbon footprint of <b>construction</b> <b>materials</b> can be systematically assessed at the product level. In this paper, the way in which the carbon footprint of <b>construction</b> <b>materials</b> is estimated is exemplified through a recently developed carbon labeling scheme. Then, the philosophy of the carbon emission encompassed tender is introduced. Finally, the challenges facing the implementation of the proposed carbon emission encompassed tender are highlighted. Through the carbon emission encompassed tender, contractors can get a reasonable reward to commensurate the carbon reduction attained through the use of low carbon <b>construction</b> <b>materials.</b> published_or_final_versio...|$|R
