25|$|Denmark has a {{civil law}} system with some {{references}} to Germanic law. Denmark resembles Norway and Sweden in never having developed a <b>case-law</b> like that of England and the United States nor comprehensive codes like those of France and Germany. Much of its law is customary.|$|E
25|$|Significant to the {{practice}} of law in the common law tradition is the legal research to determine {{the current state of the}} law. This usually entails exploring <b>case-law</b> reports, legal periodicals and legislation. Law practice also involves drafting documents such as court pleadings, persuasive briefs, contracts, or wills and trusts. Negotiation and dispute resolution skills (including ADR techniques) are also important to legal practice, depending on the field.|$|E
25|$|As of 9 May 2007 the International Criminal Tribunal for {{the former}} Yugoslavia (ICTY) had passed legally binding {{verdicts}} against six people indicted for genocide and crimes committed in Srebrenica since 1993. Trials against seven indictees are ongoing, and three are still to start. The overview of the <b>case-law</b> indicates {{that most of the}} convictions were done under the joint criminal enterprise doctrine and aiding and abetting mode of liablitiy, and comparativelly less under the command responsibility doctrine.|$|E
25|$|The early {{development}} of <b>case-law</b> in {{the thirteenth century}} has been traced to Bracton's On the Laws and Customs of England and led to the yearly compilations of court cases known as Year Books, of which the first extant was published in 1268, the same year that Bracton died. The Year Books are known as the law reports of medieval England, and are a principal source for knowledge of the developing legal doctrines, concepts, and methods in the period from the 13th to the 16th centuries, when the common law developed into recognizable form.|$|E
25|$|The {{applicant}} had patently {{been informed}} of the accusation against him and of {{the progress of the}} proceedings before the Italian courts, notwithstanding {{the fact that he had}} absconded. Furthermore, the applicant, who had deliberately chosen to remain on the run after escaping from prison, had received effective assistance during the proceedings from several lawyers specially appointed by him. Hence, the Italian and subsequently the French authorities had been entitled to conclude that the applicant had unequivocally waived his right to appear and be tried in person. The French authorities had therefore taken due account of all the circumstances of the case and of the Court’s <b>case-law</b> in granting the extradition request made by the Italian authorities: manifestly ill-founded.|$|E
500|$|However, Aurel Sari {{has since}} {{said that the}} special rapporteur's {{interpretation}} was wrong and that [...] "neither the decision to commission images depicting the Prophet in defiance of Islamic tradition, nor the actual content of the individual cartoons {{can be regarded as}} racist within the meaning of the relevant international human rights instruments" [...] although [...] "some of the more controversial pictures may nevertheless be judged 'gratuitously offensive' to the religious beliefs of Muslims in accordance with the applicable <b>case-law</b> of the European Court of Human Rights." [...] This means that the Danish authorities probably could have prohibited the drawings' dissemination if they had chosen to. Randall Hansen said that the cartoons were clearly anti-Islamic, but that this {{should not be confused with}} racism because a religion is a system of ideas not an inherent identity. Tariq Modood said that the cartoons were essentially racist because Muslims are in practice treated as a group based on their religion, and that the cartoons were intended to represent all of Islam and all Muslims in a negative way, not just Muhammad. Erik Bleich said that while the cartoons did essentialise Islam in a potentially racist way, they ranged from offensive to pro-Muslim so labelling them as a group was problematic. The Economist said [...] Muslims were not targeted in a discriminatory way, since unflattering cartoons about other religions or their leaders are frequently printed. Noam Chomsky posited that the cartoons were inspired by a spirit of [...] "ordinary racism" [...] and that they must be seen in the context of Jyllands-Posten agenda of incitement against immigrants in Denmark.|$|E
2500|$|If it be accepted, as {{can hardly}} be denied, that the answers of the judges to the {{questions}} asked by the House of Lords in 1843 are to be read {{in the light of}} the then existing <b>case-law</b> and not as novel pronouncements of a legislative character, then the [...] High Court's analysis in Stapleton's Case is compelling. [...] Their exhaustive examination of the extensive <b>case-law</b> concerning the defense of insanity prior to and at the time of the trial of M'Naughten establishes convincingly that it was morality and not legality which lay as a concept behind the judges' use of [...] "wrong" [...] in the M'Naghten rules.|$|E
2500|$|The Iorwerth Redaction {{is thought}} to {{represent}} the law as modified in Gwynedd {{during the reign of}} Llywelyn the Great {{in the first part of}} the 13th century by the jurist Iorwerth ap Madog. This is considered to be the most developed version of the law, though it does contain some archaic passages. The version in Llyfr Colan {{is thought to}} be a revision of Iorwerth, though also from the 13th century, and there is also the Llyfr y Damweiniau (possibly best translated as [...] "The book of happenings"), a collection of <b>case-law</b> linked to Colan. No manuscript has survived from Powys, though the Iorwerth Redaction does indicate where usage in Powys differs from usage in Gwynedd.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Case-law</b> {{where this}} test applies {{includes}} McLoughlin v O'Brian [...] AC 410, {{in which the}} husband and children of the claimant {{were involved in a}} car accident that was caused by the negligence of the defendant. The claimant found out about the accident an hour later and, {{when she got to the}} hospital two hours later, one child had already died. She saw her husband and children suffering and suffered shock, depression and a change of personality. The court established a spectrum of proximity; a pedestrian should be able to withstand seeing the accidents that occur in everyday life, but a family member of the victims will inevitably suffer greater emotional harm. Nonetheless, simply seeing the aftermath of the accident and not witnessing it is insufficient proximity. Similarly, seeing a video of the accident is insufficient.|$|E
2500|$|The {{bill was}} {{introduced}} by Lord Irvine to the House of Lords on 3 November 1997. In {{response to a question}} from Lord Simon, Lord Irvine confirmed that the bill did not in fact incorporate the Convention, but rather gave [...] "further effect in the United Kingdom to convention rights". Lord Irvine also rejected a proposed amendment by the Conservative Lord Kingsland which would have had the effect of obliging the domestic courts to apply the <b>case-law</b> of the European Court of Human Rights, stating that the obligation to take it into account was sufficient. The Liberal Democrats supported the bill, as did several crossbenchers including Lord Bingham, Lord Scarman, Lord Wilberforce, Lord Ackner, Lord Cooke and Lord Donaldson. The bill was opposed by the Conservative Party, although some backbenchers rebelled against the party line, most notably Lord Renton and Lord Windlesham.|$|E
2500|$|... "His vast {{acquaintance}} with practical <b>case-law,</b> the ingenuity {{of his own}} countless decisions, his genius for bringing out, in each separate case, the general rule of law which, tersely and pithily put, strikes the mind with all {{the force of a}} brilliant aphorism and sheds its light over the whole subject around--these are the features which constitute the power of his work. Roman jurisprudence had completed its dialectic training under Labeo and Sabinus, and the time had now arrived for applying to the immense mass of materials the principles, categories, and points of view that had been thus worked out. Julian's Digest exhibited Roman jurisprudence in all its strength, and its success was proportionately great. ... From the time of Salvius Julianus, and as a consequence of his labors, there was but one jurisprudence, and the lines on which it was progressing were those marked out by him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, the European Court of Human Rights {{decided that}} [...] "the {{scope of the}} terms under Article 301 of the Criminal Code, as {{interpreted}} by the judiciary, is too wide and vague and thus the provision constitutes a continuing threat to the exercise {{of the right to}} freedom of expression" [...] and [...] "that Article 301 of the Criminal Code does not meet the “quality of law” required by the Court’s settled <b>case-law,</b> since its unacceptably broad terms result in a lack of foreseeability as to its effects", finding a violation of freedom of expression (Article 10 of ECHR) in the investigation against Mr Altuğ Taner Akçam, a historian writing about the Armenian genocide. Concerning the 2008 amendments, ECHR noted that [...] "despite the replacement of the term “Turkishness” by “the Turkish Nation”, {{there seems to be no}} change or major difference in the interpretation of these concepts because they have been understood in the same manner by the Court of Cassation" [...] (Para. 92).|$|E
2500|$|In many European nations, the European Convention on Human Rights {{provides}} {{protection from}} an appropriation {{of private property}} by the state. Article 8 of the Convention provides that [...] "Everyone {{has the right to}} respect for his private and family life, his home, and his correspondence" [...] and prohibits interference with this right by the state, unless the interference is in accordance with law and necessary in the interests of national security, public safety, economic well-being of the country, prevention of disorder or crime, protection of health or morals, or protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This right is expanded by Article 1 of the First Protocol to the Convention, which states that [...] "Every natural person or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions." [...] Again, this is subject to exceptions where state deprivation of private possessions is in the general or public interest, is in accordance with law, and, in particular, to secure payment of taxes. Settled <b>case-law</b> of ECHR provides that just compensation has to be paid in cases of expropriation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second reading}} in the House of Commons took place on 16 February 1998 where the bill was {{introduced}} by Jack Straw who stated that it was [...] "the first major Bill on human rights for more than 300 years". In addition to the incorporation of the Convention in domestic law, Jack Straw indicated that the bill was intended to have two other significant effects: the modernisation and democratisation {{of the political system}} by bringing about [...] "a better balance between rights and responsibilities, between the powers {{of the state and the}} freedom of the individual" [...] and the introduction of a culture of awareness of human rights by public authorities. Amendments rejected included giving courts a greater degree of flexibility with regard to Strasbourg <b>case-law</b> and referring to the margin of appreciation accorded to states by the Court, as well as limiting the obligation to interpret legislation compatibly with Convention rights only when it was 'reasonable' to do so. A successful amendment was tabled by Labour backbencher Kevin McNamara which had the effect of incorporating into the bill Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol 6 of the Convention abolishing the death penalty in peacetime.|$|E
