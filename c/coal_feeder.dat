Traditionally base load plants are now forced to operate as peaking plants. A familiar transition in upcoming years is expected in Croatia and coal power plant operators are preparing accordingly. To evaluate cycling capabilities and control system operation for flexible operation of selected 210 MW coal plant, series of tests with different load gradients were performed and results were thoroughly analyzed. Two possible “bottlenecks” are identified, thermal stress in superheater header, and achievable ramping rate considering operational limitations of <b>coal</b> <b>feeders,</b> firing system and evaporator dynamics. Several unexpected readings were observed, usually caused by malfunctioning sensors and equipment, resulting in unexpected oscillations of superheated steam temperature.

S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 75. The state of Tennessee identified the Y- 12 Steam Plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, as a non-electrical generation unit (EGU) nitrogen oxides (NO{sub x}) budget source {{as a result of the}} NO{sub x} State Implementation Plan (SIP) under the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) Rule 1200 - 3 - 27. Following this introduction, the monitoring plan contains the following sections: CEMS details, NO{sub x} emissions, and quality assurance (QA) /quality control (QC). The following information is included in the attachments: fuel and flue gas diagram, system layout, data flow diagrams, Electronic Monitoring Plan printouts, vendor information on coal and natural gas feed systems, and the Certification Test Protocol. The Y- 12 Steam Plant consists of four Wickes boilers. Each is rated at a maximum heat input capacity of 296. 8 MMBtu/hour or 250, 000 lb/hour of 250 -psig steam. Although pulverized coal is the principal fuel, each of the units can fire natural gas or a combination of coal and gas. Each unit is equipped with a Joy Manufacturing Company reverse air baghouse to control particulate emissions. Flue gases travel out of the baghouse, through an induced draft fan, then to one of two stacks. Boilers 1 and 2 exhaust through Stack 1. Boilers 3 and 4 exhaust through Stack 2. A dedicated CEMS will be installed in the ductwork of each boiler, downstream of the baghouse. The CEMS will be designed, built, installed, and started up by URS Group, Inc. (URS). Data acquisition and handling will be accomplished using a data acquisition and handling system (DAHS) designed, built, and programmed by Environmental Systems Corporation (ESC). The installed CEMS will continuously monitor NO{sub x}, flue gas flowrate, and carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }). The CEMS will be utilized to report emissions from each unit for each ozone season starting May 1, 2003. Each boiler has independent coal and natural gas metering systems. Coal is fed to each boiler by belt-type <b>coal</b> <b>feeders.</b> Each boiler has two dedicated <b>coal</b> <b>feeders.</b> Natural gas may be burned along with coal for flame stability.

30|$|The {{mining and}} {{cleaning}} of coal at local processing sites creates {{large quantities of}} ambient particulate matter (Ghose and Banerjee 1995; Ghose and Majee 2000). Opencast mining operations contribute major air pollutants to the atmosphere and are responsible for environmental degradation by deteriorating the air quality in respect to dust, fine coal particles and other gaseous pollutants (Mukhopadhyay et al. 2010). The major sources of air pollution in coal mining area include: drilling and blasting, loading and unloading of coal and overburden, movements of heavy vehicles on haul roads, dragline operations, crushing of <b>coal</b> in <b>feeder</b> breakers, presence of fire, exposed pit faces, wind erosion and exhaust of heavy earthmover machinery (Nair and Sinha 1987; Ghose and Majee 2007; Huertas et al. 2011).

40|$|A {{continuous}} lump <b>coal</b> dry <b>feeder</b> {{was developed}} for a pressurized fluidized bed combustor. The approach was to adapt the commercially available Fuller-Kinyon pump to feed coal against a pressure differential of 100 psi or more.

Successful operation of the modified Fuller-Kinyon pump was generally limited to pressure differentials of 60 psi or less. Although the results are not conclusive, test data and observations were made that indicated that higher pressure differentials could be attained by further modifications of the test setup. In particular, {{it is recommended that}} further testing be performed after replacing the 40 -horsepower pump motor presently in the test setup with a motor having a significantly high power rating (thereby allowing pump operation with longer seals and at higher pressure differentials than those tested so far) ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{discusses}} Test Campaign TC 10 of the Kellogg Brown & Root, Inc. (KBR) Transport Gasifier {{train with}} a Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation (Siemens Westinghouse) particle filter {{system at the}} Power Systems Development Facility (PSDF) located in Wilsonville, Alabama. The Transport Gasifier is an advanced circulating fluidized-bed gasifier designed to operate as either a combustor or a gasifier in air- or oxygen-blown mode of operation using a particulate control device (PCD). The Transport Gasifier was operated as a pressurized gasifier during TC 10 in air- (mainly for transitions and problematic operations) and oxygen-blown mode. Test Run TC 10 was started on November 16, 2002, and completed on December 18, 2002. During oxygen-blown operations, gasifier temperatures varied between 1, 675 and 1, 825 F at pressures from 150 to 180 psig. After initial adjustments were made to reduce the feed rate, operations with the new fluidized <b>coal</b> <b>feeder</b> were stable with {{about half of the}} total coalfeed rate through the new feeder. However, the new fluidized-bed <b>coal</b> <b>feeder</b> proved to be difficult to control at low feed rates. Later the coal mills and original <b>coal</b> <b>feeder</b> experienced difficulties due to a high moisture content in the coal from heavy rains. Additional operational difficulties were experienced when several of the pressure sensing taps in the gasifier plugged. As the run progressed, modifications to the mills (to address processing the wet coal) resulted in a much larger feed size. This eventually resulted in the accumulation of large particles in the circulating solids causing operational instabilities in the standpipe and loop seal. Despite problems with the coal mills, <b>coal</b> <b>feeder,</b> pressure tap nozzles and the standpipe, the gasifier did experience short periods of stability during oxygenblown operations. During these periods, the syngas quality was high. During TC 10, the gasifier gasified over 609 tons of Powder River Basin subbituminous coal and accumulated a total of 416 hours of coal feed, over 293 hours of which were in oxygen-blown operation. No sorbent was used during the run...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the thermal}} Power Plants in the Kyushu Districts {{are obliged to}} use low quality coal for fuel, they have no {{alternative}} but to utilize combustion of pulverized coal. The Unit System Tube Mill is a low costing Pulveruzer, but this system has its difficulties with automatic coal feeding. The reason being that as the feed control is carried out by interlinking the draft of the exhauster which blows the pulverized coal into the furnace with the feed rate of the <b>coal</b> <b>feeder,</b> after operation over a long period，excessive quantities of coal accumulates within the mill causing Mill- over or shortage of pulverized coal comes about decreasing the load of the Power Plant. With such difficulties constantly happening, perfect automatic combustion cannot be obtained. These defects can be corrected by disconnecting the interlink between the <b>coal</b> <b>feeder</b> and the exhauster, and controlling the feed rate of the <b>coal</b> <b>feeder</b> so that a fixed quantity of coal is constantly retained within the Tube Mill. Since a detector is necessary to determine the quantity of coal retained in the Tube Mill, the Author has invented and developed an Electro-acoustic Mill Level Meter which is quick responding and enables the operator to accurately detect the quantity of coal retained within the Mill. Recently the Unit System Tube Mill coal feeding system of the No. 2 Minato Power Plant of the Kyushu Power Company was completely switched to automatic operation by the use of this invention. Following this, the same automatic coal feeding system was installed at the Ainoura Power Plant which brought about excellent operating results.

30|$|Effect of {{temperature}} on pores formation {{has also been}} investigated by Jenkins et al. (1973). They explained that as the temperature increases {{up to a certain}} level (i.e., 600  °C) porosity increases and concentration of <b>feeder</b> <b>coal</b> decreases but results in lower reactivity, with further increase in temperature. The reactivity of coal after certain temperature can be decreased because of heat treatment which promotes closing of pores. Closing of pores caused due to presence of large molecules, compressing disorganized carbon, cross linking and collapsing of pores at higher temperature due to plasticity of char (Feng and Bhatia 2003). But in contrast to above discussion, Feng and Bhatia (2003) also reported that with the increase in heat treatment time and temperature, volume of closed pores increases and there is no change in size of various pores with carbon conversion because shrinkage occurs maintaining the same distance between crystalline structures. In contrast to above results, Miura et al. (1989) and Hurt et al. (1991) have reported that the pore structure is not a factor which controls the gasification reaction rate of highly reactive char.|$|R
30|$|Siauw et al. (1984) have {{reported}} that the total pore volume and micropore volume decreases with increase in carbon content or rank of coal because the lower rank coal are much more porous than higher rank coal. The microporous volume of sample coal decreases linearly with increase in the coal rank (Siauw et al. 1984). Most of the pores of lignite lie {{in the range of}} micro and meso-pores (Siauw et al. 1984). The reactivity of coal with change in rank can be justified by the explanation of (Jenkins et al. 1973) i.e., higher rank <b>coal</b> has less <b>feeder</b> pores and lower reactive sites on the surface compared to lignite, which reduces the reactivity of higher rank coal. Siauw et al. (1984) have also investigated that the coal reactivity is almost constant up to certain total pore volume and then sudden rise in reactivity observed with increase in total pore volume. This sudden rise in reactivity can be understood by opening of unreachable pores and formation of new pores as reaction proceeds. Jenkins et al. (1973) reported that the reactivity of char having large proportion of feeder pores is high, because the reactivity of reactant gas to diffuse into the internal surface of micropores is enhanced.|$|R
5000|$|During 1834-1840, Robinson {{served as}} chief {{engineer}} {{of the new}} Philadelphia and Reading Railroad and directed construction of the line including a spectacular stone bridge and a tunnel 1,932 feet long, considered his crowning achievements. The 93-mile railroad built from the major anthracite coal fields of Pottsville to Reading {{and then to the}} port at Philadelphia was the first double track mainline in the United States (after the British model), included three of the nine first railroad tunnels in the United States, and was reportedly the first to use crushed stone ballast. (In 1828-9, Robinson had designed his first railroads—the Allegheny Portage and the Danville & Pottsville railroads—as double track lines, but these included inclines that worked better with two tracks; the Reading was the first main line designed at the outset with double tracks in mind, though with only a 22' wide grade that required widening later). Because of the extensive coal fields it tapped, the Reading would {{become one of the most}} profitable railroads in the U. S. It was also considered Moncure Robinson’s first mountain railroad without inclines—a statement about the transition from the Canal Era of <b>feeder</b> <b>coal</b> roads to water transport/canals. The Reading paralleled the Schuylkill River navigation canal, and by the 1840s proved the superiority of the railroad over the turnpikes and canals as the inland transportation system of the nineteenth century.Horses and mules, gravity and stationary steam engines on inclines, were the first motive power on Moncure Robinson’s railroads. Though he held patents on incline systems, from the beginning, he recommended British built locomotives for railroads, especially the recently perfected 0-4-0s with Bury fire box. By the mid-1830s, American mechanics had perfected the 4-2-0, with its lead swivel truck or pilot wheels - designed by John B Jervis for the Mohawk & Hudson - and Robinson recommended these for steeper grade railroads during the late 1830s, in Virginia and Pennsylvania. For the Reading, he ordered British and American made locomotives. For more power, however, he is credited with helping design in 1839 one of the earliest 4-4-0 locomotives, the [...] "Gowan & Marx," [...] named after his London banker. This, the most powerful locomotive up to that time, was built by Eastwick & Harrison of Philadelphia, and proved ideal for the coal fields tapped by the Reading (John White, American Locomotives, correctly credits others for the 4-4-0 design patent; and this is true for the mechanics of the machine, but the concept of replacing the then dominant 4-2-0s with the better tractive 4-4-0s, which would become the major locomotive type for the next thirty years or more, has been shared with Robinson).|$|R

40|$|Material {{handling}} {{is undoubtedly}} {{the most important}} and in fact an indispensable job in industries for it is encountered at every stage right from the time raw materials enter the factory gate to the point when it leaves in form of finished products. The engineering of material handling falls under two categories depending on form of material: bulk solid handling and unit handling. In case of handling lumpy materials like coals etc., feeder plays a vital role as an uninterrupted source of uniform feed provider to the conveyor system. Although several feeders like belt, apron, screw, feeders etc are available, reciprocating feeders are still in use because it ensures a continuous and controlled feed rate, is low in cost, its drive mechanism is simple, it can handle wide range of miscellaneous materials including lumps, easy in assembly and disassembly and maintenance requirement is quite low. The challenge which we have taken via the project, is to design a drive mechanism for a reciprocating <b>coal</b> <b>feeder.</b> We call it a challenge because we have to design various intricate components like couplings, worm reducers, gearbox etc. We call it complicated since all the components are interdependent on each other to a great extent. So we cannot design anything randomly. We have to take into considerations the smallest of small things like the various forces acting, how each component can fail under various stress conditions. We have to optimize everything right from the motor selection, to speed reduction ratio selection, to the capacity of coal which we can handle. We are going to follow the above-mentioned strategies so that our project does not remain just a theory but can become a reality for industries...|$|E
40|$|Rotating {{fluidised}} Beds {{offer the}} potential for high intensity combustion, large turndown and extended range of fluidising velocity due to the imposition of an artificial gravitational field. Low thermal capacity should also allow rapid response to load changes. This thesis describes investigations {{of the validity of}} these potential virtues. Experiments, at atmospheric pressure, were conducted in flow visualisation rigs and a combustor designed to accommodate a distributor 200 mm diameter and 80 mm axial length. Ancillary experiments were conducted in a 6 " diameter conventional fluidised bed. The investigations encompassed assessment of; fluidisation and elutriation, coal feed requirements, start-up and steady-state combustion using premixed propane and air, transition from propane to coal combustion and mechanical design. Assessments were made of an elutriation model and some effects of particle size on the combustion of premixed fuel gas and air. The findings were: a) more reliable start-up and control methods must be developed. Combustion of premixed propane and air led to severe mechanical and operating problems. Manual control of coal combustion was inadequate. b) Design criteria must encompass pressure loss, mechanical strength and high temperature resistance. The flow characteristics of ancillaries and the distributor must be matcheo. c) Fluidisation of a range of particle sizes was investigated. New correlations for minimum fluidisation and fully supported velocities are proposed. Some effects on elutriation of particle size and the distance between the bed surface and exhaust port have been identified. A conic distributor did not aid initial bed distribution. Furthermore, airflow instability was encountered with this distributor shape. Future use of conic distributors is not recommended. Axial solids mixing was found to be poor. A <b>coal</b> <b>feeder</b> was developed which produced uniform fuel distribution throughout the bed. The report concludes that small scale inhibits development of mechanical design and exploration of performance. future research requires larger combustors and automatic control...|$|E
40|$|The project's overall {{objective}} {{is to develop a}} commercially viable dynamic signature based sensing system that is used to infer the flow rate and fineness of pulverized coal. This eighteen month effort will focus on developments required to transfer the measurement system from the laboratory to a field ready prototype system. This objective will be achieved through the completion of the laboratory development of the sensor and data algorithm followed by full scale field tests of a portable measurement system. The sensing system utilizes accelerometers attached externally to <b>coal</b> <b>feeder</b> pipes. Raw data is collected from the impingement of the coal particles as well as the acoustic noise generated from the flow and is transformed into characteristic signatures through proper calibration that are meaningful to the operator. The laboratory testing will use a portable version of the sensing system to collect signature data from a variety of flow conditions including coal flow rates, flow orientations, and coal particle characteristics. This work will be conducted at the Coal Flow Measurement Laboratory that is sponsored by EPRI and operated by Airflow Sciences. The data will be used to enhance the algorithm and neural network required to perform real time analysis of the nonspecific signature data. The system will be installed at two full scale power plants to collect data in a real time operating scenario. These short term duration tests will evaluate the ability of the algorithm to accurately infer coal flow rates and determine if the measurement system can be used effectively in an active control loop for combustion diagnostics and burner balancing. At the completion of this project, prototype versions of both a portable system and a permanent installation will be available for final packaging and commercialization by one of the team members. Both types of systems will be marketed for conducting combustion diagnostics and balancing of individual flows to pulverized coal burners. The benefits sought through the use of this system include improvements to a plant's feed utilization rate as well as the overall efficiency of a pulverized coal combustion system...|$|E
