5|$|What then is {{the spirit}} of liberty? I cannot define it; I <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> you my own faith. The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too {{sure that it is}} right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to {{understand}} the minds of other men and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who, near two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; {{that there may be a}} kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} a 2000s {{consumer}} 3D pointing device is the Wii Remote. While primarily a motion-sensing device (that is, it can determine its orientation and direction of movement), Wii Remote can also detect its spatial position by comparing the distance and position of the lights from the IR emitter using its integrated IR camera (since the nunchuk accessory lacks a camera, it <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> its current heading and orientation). The obvious drawback to {{this approach is that}} it can only produce spatial coordinates while its camera can see the sensor bar. More accurate consumer devices have since been released, including the PlayStation Move, the Razer Hydra and the controllers part of the HTC Vive virtual reality system. All of these devices can accurately detect position and orientation in 3D space regardless of angle relative to the sensor station.|$|E
500|$|The refrain {{is based}} on a Gm–E(add2)–B–F/A chord progression. Fraser McAlphine of the BBC wrote that Rihanna feels {{confined}} [...] "in a cell of [...] own creation". She sings without vibrato, a pulsating musical effect used to add expression. One commentator, The New York Times David Brownie, wrote that despite this, her voice subtly shows grief and regret. Eminem then [...] "zap out into a ballady rap": [...] "I can't tell you what it really is/ I <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> you what it feels like." [...] The verses follow a Gm–E(add2)B–Fsus/A chord progression. Eminem regrets an end to an abusive, failed relationship, describing mutual violence and expressing both fondness and anger. The two artists' characters are portrayed in a romantic relationship when he responds to Rihanna by concluding the verse: [...] "I laid hands on her. I'll never stoop so low again/ I guess I don't know my own strength." [...] Rihanna sings the chorus again, backed by an electric guitar and a piano.|$|E

500|$|Landing near Constantinople, Calafia {{meets with}} other Moslem warrior leaders who {{were unable to}} remove King Amadis and his Christian allies from the city, and she tells them all to hold back and watch her manner of combat—she says they will be amazed. The next morning, she and her women warriors mount their [...] "fierce beasts" [...] wearing gold armor [...] "adorned with the most {{precious}} stones", advancing to invest the city. Calafia orders the griffins forward and they, hungry from the long sea voyage, fly out and maul the city's defenders. Sating their hunger, the griffins continue to snatch Christian men in their claws and carry them high in air only to drop them to their deaths. The city's defenders cower and hide from the griffins. Seeing this, Calafia passes word to her Moslem allies that {{they are free to}} advance and take the city. The griffins, however, cannot tell Moslem from Christian; they <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> man from woman. The griffins begin snatching Moslem soldiers and carrying them aloft, dropping and killing them. Calafia questions her pagan faith, saying, [...] "O ye idols in whom I believe and worship, what is this which has happened as favorably to my enemies as to my friends?" [...] She orders her woman warriors to take the city's battlements and they fight well, taking many injuries from arrows and quarrels piercing the soft gold metal of their armor. Calafia orders her allies forward to assist the Californians in battle, but the griffins pounce again, killing Moslem men. She directs the griffin trainers to call them off, and the griffins return to roost in the ships.|$|E
2500|$|On April 5, 2006, Rae {{applied for}} {{membership}} in the Liberal Party of Canada. His candidacy for the federal party leadership was supported by Greg Sorbara and George Smitherman, former Chrétien aides Eddie Goldenberg and Rae's brother John, as well as former top Martin advisor John Webster and others associated with the Martin camp. He announced his candidacy on April 24, 2006. At his campaign launch he responded to his critics by saying, [...] "I made mistakes before I was in politics, I made mistakes when I was in politics, I made mistakes as premier... I <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> you I have learned from those mistakes and I am the wiser for them." [...] Rae's predecessor as premier, David Peterson who was supporting Michael Ignatieff, criticized Rae's entry into the race due to his record as NDP provincial premier, though insisting that he did not hold a personal grudge against Rae.|$|E

40|$|Robotic {{vehicles}} and especially autonomous robotic vehicles can be attractive targets for attacks that cross the cyber-physical divide, that is cyber attacks or sensory channel attacks affecting {{the ability to}} navigate or complete a mission. Detection of such threats is typically limited to knowledge-based and vehicle-specific methods, which are applicable to only specific known attacks, or methods that require computation power that is prohibitive for resource-constrained vehicles. Here, we present a method based on Bayesian Networks that <b>can</b> not <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> whether an autonomous vehicle is under attack, but also whether the attack has originated from the cyber or the physical domain. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach on an autonomous robotic vehicle built {{in accordance with the}} Generic Vehicle Architecture specification and equipped with a variety of popular communication and sensing technologies. The results of experiments involving command injection, rogue node and magnetic interference attacks show that the approach is promising...|$|R
