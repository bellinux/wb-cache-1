5|$|Hot chocolate, {{also known}} as hot cocoa, {{drinking}} chocolate or just cocoa is a heated beverage consisting of shaved chocolate, melted chocolate or <b>cocoa</b> <b>powder,</b> heated milk or water, and usually a sweetener. Hot chocolate may be topped with whipped cream. Hot chocolate made with melted chocolate is sometimes called drinking chocolate, characterized by less sweetness and a thicker consistency.|$|E
5|$|Several {{negative}} effects {{may be attributed}} to the drinking of hot chocolate. The types and severity of health risks vary between different styles of hot chocolate. Hot chocolate made from milk also contains the sugars naturally found in milk. Processed <b>cocoa</b> <b>powder</b> usually contains additional sugars.

5|$|Applesauce cake is {{a dessert}} cake {{prepared}} using apple sauce, flour and sugar as main ingredients. Store-bought or homemade applesauce {{may be used}} in its preparation.

Some versions include dried or fresh, finely grated ginger. After baking, applesauce cake is sometimes topped with an icing, frosting or glaze, such as a caramel glaze. It also may be served topped with a dusting of confectioner's sugar or whipped cream. Gluten-free applesauce cake can be prepared using rice flour.|$|E

25|$|The {{future price}} of cocoa butter and <b>cocoa</b> <b>powder</b> is {{determined}} by multiplying the bean price by a ratio. The combined butter and powder ratio has tended to be around 3.5. If the combined ratio falls below 3.2 or so, production ceases to be economically viable and some factories cease extraction of butter and powder and trade exclusively in cocoa liquor.|$|E
25|$|Treating with alkali {{produces}} Dutch-process <b>cocoa</b> <b>powder,</b> {{which is}} less acidic, darker, and more mellow in flavor than what is generally available {{in most of the}} world. Regular (nonalkalized) cocoa is acidic, so when cocoa is treated with an alkaline ingredient, generally potassium carbonate, the pH increases. This process can be done at various stages during manufacturing, including during nib treatment, liquor treatment, or press cake treatment.|$|E
500|$|In 1828, Coenraad Johannes van Houten {{developed}} the first <b>cocoa</b> <b>powder</b> producing {{machine in the}} Netherlands. The press separated the greasy cocoa butter from cacao seeds, leaving a purer chocolate powder behind. This powder, much like instant <b>cocoa</b> <b>powder</b> used today, was easier to stir into milk and water. As a result, another very important discovery was made: solid chocolate. By using <b>cocoa</b> <b>powder</b> and low amounts of cocoa butter, it was then possible to manufacture chocolate bars. The term [...] "chocolate" [...] then came to mean solid chocolate rather than hot chocolate, with the first chocolate bar being created in 1847.|$|E

2500|$|To make 1kg (2.2lb) of chocolate, about 300 to 600 {{beans are}} processed, {{depending}} on the desired cocoa content. In a factory, the beans are roasted. Next, they are cracked and then deshelled by a [...] "winnower". The resulting pieces of beans are called nibs. They are sometimes sold in small packages at specialty stores and markets {{to be used in}} cooking, snacking, and chocolate dishes. Since nibs are directly from the cocoa tree, they contain high amounts of theobromine. Most nibs are ground, using various methods, into a thick, creamy paste, known as chocolate liquor or cocoa paste. [...] This [...] "liquor" [...] is then further processed into chocolate by mixing in (more) cocoa butter and sugar (and sometimes vanilla and lecithin as an emulsifier), and then refined, conched and tempered. [...] Alternatively, it can be separated into <b>cocoa</b> <b>powder</b> and cocoa butter using a hydraulic press or the Broma process. This process produces around 50% cocoa butter and 50% <b>cocoa</b> <b>powder.</b> Standard <b>cocoa</b> <b>powder</b> has a fat content around 10–12%.
