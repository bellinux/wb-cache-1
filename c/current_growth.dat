The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of pruning (current and previous season’s vegetative growth) and PBZ (3 ml / m canopy diameter) on flowering, yield and leaf phenol contents in mango cvs. Raspuri. Early flowering as a result of PBZ application led to advanced fruit harvest by 20. 4 days in trees pruned to <b>current</b> sea-son’s <b>growth</b> followed by 20. 7 days in unpruned trees. Drastic increase in total phenolics, total flavonoids and phenolic acid contents were observed at 75 days after PBZ application in PBZ treated unpruned trees and in trees pruned to <b>current</b> season’s <b>growth.</b> The high levels of coumaric acid, 4 -hydroxy benzoic acid and salysilic acid and low levels of caffeic acid and t-cinnamic acid were observed following PBZ application in tree pruned to <b>current</b> season’s <b>growth</b> and unpruned trees compared to control.

25|$|Islam in Finland was {{originally}} associated with Finnish Tatars, who immigrated in the Russian {{era in the}} 19th century. Judaism in Finland was banned in the Swedish era, and current Finnish Jews descend likewise from Russian-era immigrants. Catholicism in Finland had a low-key existence following the reformation, and exists today as a minor religion among Finns. These religions have attracted few Finnish followers; their <b>current</b> <b>growth</b> is due to immigration. Atheism was illegal in the Swedish era, and church attendance was mandatory by law, with punishments for encouraging non-attendence. Even in the Russian era, each person had to officially belong to a religious denomination. Irreligion in Finland and criticism of religion found public expression during the 19th and early 20th century. A law on the freedom of religion in 1923 made irreligion legal.|$|E

25|$|Women remain {{very much}} a {{minority}} in Japanese science (15% in 2013), although the situation has improved slightly (13% in 2008) since the government fixed a target in 2006 of raising the ratio of female researchers to 25%. Calculated {{on the basis of}} the current number of doctoral students, the government hopes to obtain a 20% share of women in science, 15% in engineering and 30% in agriculture and health by the end of the current Basic Plan for Science and Technology in 2016. In 2013, Japanese female researchers were most common in the public sector in health and agriculture, where they represented 29% of academics and 20% of government researchers. In the business sector, just 8% of researchers were women (in head counts), compared to 25% in the academic sector. In other public research institutions, women accounted for 16% of researchers. One of the main thrusts of Abenomics, Japan’s <b>current</b> <b>growth</b> strategy, is to enhance the socio-economic role of women. Consequently, the selection criteria for most large university grants now take into account the proportion of women among teaching staff and researchers.|$|E
