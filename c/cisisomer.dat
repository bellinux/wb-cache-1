Theseracemic mixture were well resolved and separated by one of these commercially availableenzymes, L-acylase, ?-chymotrypsin and subtilisin Carlsberg. The epoxides were obtained byepoxidation of the side chain of enatiomerically pure 2 -amino- 4 -pentenoic acid and its higher homologue 2 -amino- 5 -hexenoic acid (homo allyl glycine). The epoxides were thenintramolecularly cyclized to form 4 -hydroxyproline from epoxide of allyl glycine or 5 -hydroxypipecolic acid from epoxide of homo allyl glycine. The enatiomers of allyl glycine were separated by effective resolution aided bysubtilisin Carlsberg or L-acylase. The enatiomerically pure allyl glycine derivatives with(Boc) protection were epoxidized with m-CPBA which generated the inseparablediastereomeric epoxide. Upon removal of the Boc protection generated highly nucleophilicamine which attacked the side-chain epoxide intramolecularly at the C 5 carbon generating 4 -hydroxyproline derivatives. Due to presence of 2 chiral centers formed during theepoxidation trans- and cis- isomers of 4 -hydroxyprolines are formed. Fortunately the <b>cisisomer</b> was transformed to a lactone with the removal of alcohol. The cis-conformation of the hydroxyl and ester was necessary for the intramolecular reaction; the trans- isomer remained as such without lactone formation. Due to the selective intramolecular lactonization of the cis- isomer into an hydrophobic lactone, the separation of the lactone from the hydrophilic trans- isomer was facile and easy. Similarly starting from the D- isomers two diastereomers 6 of 4 -hydroxyproline were synthesized. Similarly racemic mixture of 2 -amino- 5 -hexenoic acid were synthesized from diethylmalonate derivatives. This racemic mixture of 2 -amino- 5 -hexenoic acid was separated byresolution aided by L-acylase or ?-chymotrypsin. The separated enatiomerically pure aminoacids with tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) protection were oxidized with excess amount of 3 -chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA). The oxidation by m-CPBA generates two inseparablediastereomeric epoxides which are formed due to new chiral center at C 5 carbon. One of thediastereomeric epoxide in the inseparable mixture was selectively converted to a dihydroxylcompound catalyzed by Jacobsen 2 ̆ 7 s hydrolytic kinetic resolution (HKR) which was easilyseparated from the remaining diastereomeric epoxide. The epoxide was converted to a vicinalhalohydrin, with bromide attacking on terminal C 6 carbon. Upon (Boc) deprotection of thehalohydrin, the free amine attacked the C 6 carbon, generating 5 -hydroxypipecolic acid whichwas isolated in good yield after protection of the amine with (Boc) group. In a similar manner the dihydroxyl component which was converted to an halohydrin by efficient regioselective mono-tosylation with catalytic (Bu 2 SnO) followed tosyl replacment by iodine substitution. The halohydrin was used to synthesize 5 -hydroxypipecolic acid derivative by Boc removalwith acid treatment, intramolecular cyclization, N- reprotection and isolation. The samesequence was repeated for D- isomers. Finally racemic mixture of 2 -amino- 5 -hexenoic acid were prepared by the samesequence described above. This racemates were subjected to subtilisin carlsberg basedresolution, which gave chiraly pure 2 -amino- 5 -hexenoic acid. The alkene side chain of thefully protected amino acids were oxidized with m-CPBA, which gave the diastereomers,which were not separable. On treating the epoxide with acid led to the removal of N-Bocgroup and formation of the free amine. This amine was allowed to attack the epoxide, bytreating the amine with base, which led to the neutralization of the acid. The amine 7 regioselective attacked the C 6 carbon to generate the 5 -hydroxypipecolic acid derivatives. The amine was again reprotected with Boc 2 O to generate the fully protected 5 -hydroxypipecolic acid derivatives Due to the diastereomeric nature of the starting material, twoproduct were formed (cis-) and (trans) - 5 -hydroxypipecolic acid. But in our reactionconditions the cis- isomer due to the close proximity of the hydroxyl and ester groupunderwent in-situ lactonization to form the hydrophobic lactone. The lactone was easilyisolated from the trans- ester. Similarly starting from the L- isomer two isomers of 5 -hydroxypipecolic acid were obtained. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:工博甲第 401 号 学位授与年月日:平成 27 年 9 月 25 日 1. Introduction| 2. Instrumentation| 3.
