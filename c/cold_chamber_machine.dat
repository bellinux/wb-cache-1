Die cast EN AC- 46000 alloy plates for microstructural investigation and bend testing were produced using a multispecimen die in a high pressure, <b>cold</b> <b>chamber</b> <b>machine.</b> The Cr ranged within the tolerance limits of the EN AC- 46000 type alloys, according to the EN 1706 standard. The investigations allowed evaluation of modifications to microstructural and bending properties produced by Cr additions. In particular, the microstructural analysis revealed that the morphology of primary sludge compounds was mainly cubic-type, such as polyhedral, star-like and blocky, while proeutectic α-Alx(Fe,Mn,Cr) ySiz intermetallics showed blocky or polyhedral morphology at any Cr level. Increasing the Cr content, the whole area fraction of these particles increased and the primary intermetallic compounds segregated in the central region of the cross section of the castings. This was associated to a mechanism similar to that suggested for the ESCs entrapment. The increase of brittle Fe-rich particles affected the fracture load and the displacement to fracture of the alloy at the highest Cr level...|$|E

40|$|The need to {{optimise}} the chemical composition of a diecasting alloy {{as a function}} of the technological properties requested by the casting process, led to the development of test apparatus and procedures that allow a comparative assessment of the castability performances in a steel tool and the chemical interaction between the liquid alloy and the die steel.

To evaluate the casting behaviour of the alloy in a high thermal conductivity die, a vacuum suction test in a small diameter steel pipe was designed and set up. The measure of the suction length through the pipe due to the pressure difference, allowed a comparison of the fluidity between the tested alloys, at different overheating casting temperatures, and traditional diecasting copper alloy of known performances, taken as the reference alloy. Test results, in terms of suction length and solidified flow front shape, led to the adjustment of chemical composition of a new alloy with better casting performances, overcoming the traditional alloy’s ones. Some static tests were also carried out in order to evaluate the interaction between the liquid alloy and the die steel at high temperature and the effect of alloy iron content and lubricant film on die steel/copper alloy soldering...|$|R
