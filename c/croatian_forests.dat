40|$|In {{addition}} {{to the process of}} photosynthesis, the bee community is the main source of energy in food production, honey-plants used by game and people in the hunting grounds ecosystem. It is a well-known fact that thousands of plant species depend on the presence of bee communities (pollination, fertilization). In this paper we studied the presence of the bee community in the hunting grounds of <b>Croatian</b> <b>Forests,</b> and their influence on the number of game (wild pigs), as well as the quality of honey, honey plants in the hunting grounds used by people and game. We established the total number of game (wild boars). The honey quality parameters were determined using the Harmonised methods of the European Honey (Bogdanov et al., 1997) and the pollen analysis by were conducted according to Harmonised methods of melissopalynology (Von der Ohe et al., 2004). Research results indicate that the presence of the bee community influences the number of wild boars from 3 – 18 %, and the quality of honey is in line with the European and world standards. The SAS/STAT package was used for the statistical analysis (SAS Institute Inc., 2000). The significance of the differences among the groups was determined by Duncan test...|$|E

Potvrđena je prisutnost 7 vrsta kukaca iz redova Hemiptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera i Hymenoptera koji se mogu smatrati stranim, odnosno invazivnim vrstama kukaca. To su Parectopa robiniella, Phyllonorycter robiniella, Phyllonorycter issiki, Obolodiplosis robiniae, Leptoglossus occidentalis, Metcalfa pruinosa i Dryocosmus kuriphilus. Za svaku nađenu vrstu daje se prognoza njezinog širenja i šteta u sljedećim godinama. Ovo istraživanje pokazalo je da su se strane vrste udomaćile u šumskim ekosustavima Hrvatske, a neke od njih su potencijalni ozbiljni šumski štetnici. Alien {{species are}} intentionaly or unintetionaly {{introduced}} species into new area. When an alien species succefully invades and impacts a new ecosystem {{it becomes an}} invasive species. Until today, 109 invasive insects on woody plants (57 from North America, 52 form Asia) have been introduced and established in forest ecosystems in Europe (MATTSON et al. 2007). Introduction and dispersal of new species is increasing {{from year to year}} due to globalization of trade and ever increasing tourist traffic between continents. The aim of this research was to identify most important alien and invasive insect species in <b>Croatian</b> <b>forests</b> and give an estimate od their damage and prognosis of their future spread. The research has lasted for 5 years (2006 to 2010) and potential host plants in continental, submediterranean and mediterranean parts of Croatia were researched. For each invasive species found a prognosis for their future spread and damages is given according to their biology, ecology, researches on natural enemies and data from the literature. Seven (7) insects species from the orders Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera and Hemiptera were found and they can be cosidered as alien or invasive species in Croatian forest ecosystems (Table 1). For each insect species a host plant, locality where the insect was found and prognosis of damage on the scale from 1 to 4 (1 -no influence on host plant, 4 -serious forest pest) is given. Parectopa robiniella, Phyllonorycter robiniella, Phyllonorycter issiki, Obolodiplosis robiniae, Leptoglossus occidentalis, Metcalfa pruinosa, Dryocosmus kuriphilusare alien or invasive insects established in <b>Croatian</b> <b>forests.</b> Introduction and spread of these species and their intensity of occurence has been very similar to the same pattern of spread and occurence in other Euro-paean countries. Several other invasive species on woody ornamental plants in urban areas have also been recorded in Croatia: Phyllonorycter leucographella, Dasineura gleditchiae,Argyresthia thuiella, Cameraria ohridella, Anoplophora chinensis. Knowledge on insect origin, biology, ecology, pathways of introduction and spreading are very important for providing pest risk analysis and making relevant prognosis of dangers that a new pest is posing for forest ecosystems...|$|E

Following the implementation of green tax in Croatia and present European trends, the aim of this research is to investigate state of economic mechanisms and possible need for change or adaptation to the new trends. Material and methods: Primary data were collected by interviewing forestry professionals in charge of collection and distributions of green tax to gain an insight of their perception on importance of green tax, their comments on recent decrease in prescribed rate and what are the issues related to tax collection. Also very short telephone questionnaires were conducted with taxpayers to get an impression on how taxpayers perceive their obligation, their awareness of the purpose of this payment, their participation in discussion related to green tax and do they receive annual reports from Croatian Forest Ltd. company related to money collected and spent. Secondary data consisted of review of relevant literature, legislation overview and analysis of reports on collection and distribution of green tax provided by <b>Croatian</b> <b>Forests</b> Ltd. company. Results and conclusion: Collected amount of green tax grew constantly given the period 1993 - 2009. Important factor was increased monitoring of tax collection.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Dead wood {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} factors for biodiversity in forests. Lignicolous fungi are key players; they are responsible for primary decomposition and they play important role in nutrient cycles. Pedunculate oak forests in Croatia are one of the most significant sources of organic material and mineral elements which provide habitat, nutrition or food to a variety of organisms of which some play an important role in its composition and mineralization. The purpose of our study was to reveal the species spectrum of lignicolous fungi on Pedunculate oak in lowland forests of Central Croatia. Materials and Methods: During the three-year research period (2002 – 2004), fruit bodies of lignicolous fungi were collected on living standing trees, fallen logs, stumps, timber assortments in the forest and on log yards, and fallen dead branches on Pedunculate oak in Pokupski bazen and Lonjsko polje in Central Croatia. Identification based on upon their macroscopic and microscopic characteristics, using standard binocular and light microscope. Results and Conclusions: A total of 72 species of lignicolous fungi on Pedunculate oak in lowland forests of Central Croatia were identified during the research. One species from Croatian Red list of fungi was identified: Hapalopilus croceus. A certain number of species found during this research can be considered as harmful lignicolous fungi in managed Pedunculate oak forests attacking standing trees, causing heartrot at the stem, stem base or root. Because of geographical diversity, <b>Croatian</b> <b>forests</b> have high biodiversitiy potential for lignicolous fungi...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: The {{relevance}} {{and importance of}} forestry entrepreneurship is constantly increasing, especially in countries with high transition dynamics in forestry sector. In Croatia, forestry entrepreneurs have in short time become an indispensable part in the performing of harvesting {{and other types of}} forestry operations. This paper presents the current status and perspectives of forestry entrepreneurship in Croatia. Materials and Methods: Based on the analysis of the available data from various sources (normative state acts, Forestry Chamber’s official registries, databases and documents, state forestry company business reports etc.), this paper provides an overview of the legal and institutional framework for the activities of private entrepreneurs in Croatian forestry with particular attention to licensing forestry contractors {{and the role of the}} Croatian Chamber of Forest and Wood Technology Engineers (Forestry Chamber). Results and Conclusions: The paper explains the activities, tasks, organization structure and formal bodies of the Forestry Chamber. The licensing model is also presented together with the formal criteria and minimum conditions which forestry entrepreneurs have to fulfill in order to acquire a license for forest work operations. Structural characteristics and the profile of forestry entrepreneurs is given by the number, size and type of business, the type of forest operations for which they are licensed, and the volume of work that they are performing for <b>Croatian</b> <b>Forests</b> Ltd, the state forest company.

40|$|Urban forests provide many environmental, {{social and}} {{economic}} benefits and contribute to {{quality of life of}} people in urban areas. Taking into consideration constantly growing population in urban areas all around the world, and all what comes with it, we cannot but to agree that urban forests are our urban future. Therefore the way how we treat them and how we make decisions about them becomes very important. With the aim to highlight the importance of the urban forests and to present it to the wider scientific and professional audience, <b>Croatian</b> <b>Forest</b> Research Institute together with IUFRO (Division 6 – Social Aspects of Forests and Forestry; unit 6. 07. 00 - Urban Forestry) and FOPER project of the European Forest Institute organised conference “Forests for cities, forests for people: perspectives on urban forest governance”. The idea for the Conference came from the ongoing South East European regional project FORCITY (“Citizens and urban forest governance in SEE: case studies in selected cities”) that addresses urban forest governance and satisfaction of citizens with their urban forests. The Conference was held on 27 th and 28 th of October 2012 in Zagreb and has attracted many scientists and experts that deal with urban forestry. On the behalf of the organizers the Conference was opened by the welcoming words of the Director of <b>Croatian</b> <b>Forest</b> Research Institute, Dr. Dijana Vuletić, and then followed by keynotes of Prof. Dr. Margaret A. Shannon, Prof. Dr. Maureen McDonough and Prof. Dr. Cecil C. Konijnendijk. During two days, 20 oral and 14 poster presentations were presented. In total, the Conference was attended by 80 participants from 20 countries, 15 European and 5 non-Europe (USA, Turkey, India, Iran, Colombia). After the official part of the Conference, attendees had opportunity to visit The Green Horseshoe of Zagreb, a series of parks and tree-lined squares that run from Zagreb’s main station, up to the city’s main square and loop around in the shape of horseshoe.

40|$|Background and purpose: Even-aged forests {{prevail in}} Croatia’s forestry. Rotation period is based mostly on natural parameters. In practice, {{rotation}} period {{is given by}} Croatian Rulebook of forest management. Cutting age is determined based on inventory data and many other stand characteristics. Rotation period is a planned time and it always has to be unique for particular tree species, and cutting age is the age of a stand {{at the moment of}} the final cut. The aim of the paper is to compare rotation period based on economic parameters and rotation period determined by using forest inventory data. Material and methods: Owing to absence of long term stand calculation data, research object was taken from Forest Management Handbook (1995). Mean annual increment (MAI) and current annual increment (CAI) provided fundamental data for calculations. The research was conducted at one hectare Common Beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) stand. Assortment structure and value of timber was estimated by the present cutting value method calculated by using <b>Croatian</b> <b>forests</b> Ltd. Price list for the year 2008. Labor costs in forest exploitation were also taken into account. Results and conclusion: In order to achieve cost-effective management of common beech stands, it is necessary to adjust current optimal rotation period. Optimal rotation period should be based on management goals as the main factors. So far the most common criterion adopted in Croatian forestry has been the rotation of maximum sustained yield or maximum Mean annual increment. The presented results indicate that common forest management practice should be changed in order to achieve cost-effective management of beech stands in the future...|$|E
40|$|According to the {{classification}} of business activities in the National Classification of Activities, agriculture, forestry and fishery together account for 3. 43 % of all injuries recorded in 2009, which places them in {{the lower part of}} the annual review (Table 1). However, in the said group, the state forestry enterprise (<b>Croatian</b> <b>Forests</b> Ltd. Zagreb) accounts for 48. 46 % of all injuries at work, which makes 1. 66 % of all injuries recorded in 2009. Comparing the number of injuries in <b>Croatian</b> <b>forests</b> with the number of employees in 2009, an exceptionally high ratio is obtained of 29. 40 injuries per 1000 employees, the highest index among the above said industry sectors. Nevertheless, according to standard indicators of the level of security and protection of workers, in this decade forestry has recorded positive trends in relation to key indicators. Also, the state forestry enterprise halved the number of injuries (Table 2). Working techniques of workers directly employed in forest operations play a key role in achieving a satisfactory degree of safety and efficiency in forestry work. The assessment of working techniques of forest workers employed in logging and timber production has been carried out by the Faculty of Forestry continuously since 2000 (Table 3). Findings of a ten-year evaluation indicate the following:• since the beginning of monitoring, a relatively steady increasing trend of the level of working techniques has been recorded, while the accomplished potential (AP), calculated using the overall mean scores, has ranged between 0. 79 and 0. 88 utilizations,• mean value of AP is 0. 84, which suggests an average of 16 % of unaccomplished potential and it is a scope to improve working techniques,• rating of 2010 (2. 63) keeps the increasing trend of working techniques levels, but such a positive difference is not statistically significant,• a decreasing trend of the lowest ratings (1) stops in 2010, by reducing the share of medium grade (2) and increasing the proportion of top grade (3). The evaluation of mechanized skidding has been carried out since 2008 by separate monitoring of the skidder-driver and chokerman (Table 4). Key findings are as follows:• performance level of work activities moderately grows with a decrease of the weakest ratings (1) and with the increase of the share of medium grade (2),• mean value of the accomplished potential (AP) amounts to 0. 825 in 2009, which means an average of 17. 5 % of unaccomplished potential and it is a scope for improvement of working techniques. According to the Forests Act, forestry work can be carried out exclusively by registered and licensed contractors. According to the review of the Croatian Chamber of Forestry and Wood Technology of November 2010, there are 238 forestry contractors registered with license. It is evident that more than 85 % of all licensed service contractors are engaged in logging, silviculture, and construction of forest roads (Table 6). Past practice of training for professional forest work shows that the greatest problems are related to:• uneven and incomplete programs and subject-matter training,• a significant reduction, even lack of practical training,• application of non-transparent training evaluation criteria. Additionally, training is conducted by programs that are not verified or independently assessed, and also there is no control of adequacy of human and technical resources for training. Also, it is not known that anyone has ever been denied to organize the training, e. g. for lack of specific resources and training ground for practical work. Also, Croatian forestry has no compulsory certification of operators of forestry machinery. There is no organized training of forest owners for forest work in Croatia. The first step in building such a system started with training 17 professionals by the Forestry Extension Service during 2008 at the Faculty of Forestry, University of Zagreb, where they were trained as trainers of safety in forestry work. In future, they should be mediators between forest owners who are interested in independent forest operations and educational training centers. During 2009, 6 experts of the Forestry Extension Services went through training in the Secondary Forestry School in Karlovac by which they were trained to implement the theoretical part of the training of forest owners for forest work. A part of practical training of forest owners was planned to be carried out in the polygon of the Secondary Forestry School in Karlovac. Interest in training for independent forest operations was shown by more than 500 forest owners. The Faculty of Forestry in Zagreb developed the idea of establishing a National Center for forest work. The center is envisioned as an agency with public authorities and international accreditation for certification of training for forest work and for work with specific tools such as chainsaw (Fig. 2). The idea of the Center was first included in the project proposal of the National Program for occupational safety in forestry 2007. The primary tasks of the Center would be as follows:• connecting Croatia into European processes and programs related to safety in forestry,• establishing a collaborative network in order to implement the EU-project standard of forest workers in Croatia,• introduction of certification of all aspects of training for professional work (Fig. 1), including forest certification program, performance and contractor training,• introduction of certification for training of non-professionals (especially forest owners) to work with chainsaw,• verification procedures in licensing of registered forestry contractors,• monitoring of the minimum technical requirements for training polygons,• establishment of an IT system for providing security with a registry of certificates issued. Considering the current legislative context, the Center for Forest Work should be formed as an agency with public authorities. The framework for the establishment and functioning of the Center should be created by alterations of the »Ordinance on occupational safety in forestry«. This ordinance should impose an obligation of training certification for all holders of such activities in the forestry sector. The establishment of a Center would also stimulate training market development, where it would be important to observe the above said rules in determining the qualifications and minimum requirements for legal and natural persons engaged in training for forest work. In the preparatory phase, cooperation and partnership should be initiated by the signing of agreements regarding the establishment and start-up of the Center between the respective ministry, the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Forests</b> Ltd., Faculty of Forestry, and the Croatian Forest Research Institute – primarily for integrating human and technical resources.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Croatian Forest Research Institute and <b>Croatian</b> <b>Forests</b> Ltd., Zagreb, have in 2010 jointly {{proposed}} a scientific experiment on permanent experimental plots called “The Impact of the Intensity of Silvicultural Tending on Pedunculate Oak Dieback”. The basis {{for setting up}} experimental plots were {{the results of the}} analysis of surface structure of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) stands of Spačva Forest and its projection area for the next 140 years, and the related issues of regeneration of old and tending of young stands in conditions of increasing climate change. In the future this will present a major problem for forestry practice in silvicultural operations, both in terms of workers and materials. Materials and Methods: The experiment was conducted in the area of Forest Administration Vinkovci, Forest Office Vinkovci, Management Unit Kunjevci, in three subcompartments of different age (10, 15 and 20 years) where different intensities tending operations of cleaning were conducted. A total of 20 plots were established by using the already established network of silvicultural lines and paths, while the position was recorded by a GPS device. On each plot 30 pedunculate oak trees were permanently marked (600 trees in total). Tree selection was based on spatial and phenotypic criteria. Results: The initial measurement on permanent experimental plots shows unsatisfactory number of pedunculate oak trees along with the high number of common hornbeam trees. The overall basal area has a tendency of continuous growth in relation to the age of experimental plots. The value of crown length in relation to the total height of pedunculate oak trees is 74. 3 % in subcompartment 32 A, 53. 5 % in subcompartment 34 A, and 54. 3 % in subcompartment 38 A. Trunk length, i. e. trunk purity also increases with age; in subcompartment 32 A on average it amounts to 1. 35 m, in subcompartment 34 A to 3. 28 m and in subcompartment 38 A to 4. 85 m.

In the preparatory phase, cooperation and partnership should be initiated by the signing of agreements regarding the establishment and start-up of the Center between the respective ministry, the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Forests</b> Ltd., Faculty of Forestry, and the Croatian Forest Research Institute – primarily for integrating human and technical resources. The forthcoming Center would be financed from the state budget for its public activities (e. g. implementation of IT system) and income earned from its own collection of fees from holders of certifications and/or licenses...|$|E

Uz drvo, tu je niz nedrvnih proizvoda i usluga koje šuma pruža. Taj proces je naravno dobro do šao i u sektor privatnog šumoposjedništva. Nedrvne šumske proizvode i usluge čine razni plodovi šumskog drveća i grmlja, gljive, razni predmeti izrađeni od sitnog drvnog i nedrvnog materijala, te posebice socijalne usluge šuma kao što su rekreacija, turizam, lov, foto-lov i sl. (Sabadi i dr. 2005). Upravo intenzivnije korištenje nedrvnih šumskih proizvoda i usluga otvara mogućnost razvoja sitnog, malog i srednjeg poduzetništva, koje može potaknuti gospodarski razvoj ruralnih sredina. Radi boljeg razumijevanja postojećeg stupnja korištenja i mogućnosti razvoja na bazi tih proizvoda u sklopu projekta “Utvrđivanje vrijednosti i mogućnosti korištenja ostalih proizvoda i usluga šuma” za Hrvatske šume d. o. o. na području Uprave šuma podružnice Karlovac, provodi se istraživanje stupnja korištenja ovih proizvoda od lokalnog stanovništva te njihovog interesa za intenzivnijim korištenjem nedrvnih proizvoda i usluga šuma. U tu svrhu oblikovan je upitnik za prikupljanje podataka metodom intervjuiranja stanovništva općina Topusko, Vojnić i Gvozd, koje gravitira Petrovoj gori kao izabranom šumskom području, s izraženom zaštitnom i socijalnom funkcijom. Upitnik je djelomično strukturiran, odnosno sadrži pitanja s unaprijed određenim odgovorima i otvorena pitanja, a podijeljen je u nekoliko logičkih cjelina. U ovom radu opisana je korištena metoda, upitnik te se iznose prvi rezultati istraživanja. Na projektu sudjeluju djelatnici Odjela za uređivanje šuma i šumarskueko nomiku Šumarskog instituta, Jastrebarsko, djelatnici Hrvatskih šumad. o. o., UŠP Karlovac na području Petrove gore i studentica Sveučilišta Paris 12, na postdipomskom studiju iz bioresursa. Prikupljeni podaci poslužit će i za izradu dvaju magistarskih radova te je anketiranje lokalnog stanovništva obavljeno od strane ovo dvoje pristupnika. Konačni rezultati ukazuju na dosta visok stupanj korištenja nedrvnih šumskih proizvoda te razumijevanja važnosti funkcija i usluga koje šume pružaju ko risnicima. Također se posjedovanje šume pokazalo kao izuzetno značajan čimbenik koji utječe na stavove ispitanika, stupanj korištenja nedrvnih šumskih proizvoda, kao i izbor aktivnosti kojima se bave dok su u šumi. Značajan broj ispitanika iskazao je interes za pokretanjem privatnog poduzetništva temeljen na intenzivnijem korištenju ovih proizvoda i usluga, gdje su šumoposjednici značajno više zainteresirani od onih koji ne posjeduju šumu. Rezultati ukazuju na postojanje interesa, ali istovremeno nedostatak financijskih sredstava i znanja što otvara prostor za djelovanje u smjeru poticanja kako privatnog poduzetništva od strane lokalne uprave i/ili ŠSS, kao i povećanja raz nolikosti pro izvoda od poduzeća za gospodarenje šumama. Nowadays {{under the}} {{influence}} of climate changes it becomes clearer that forestry profession needs to take advantage from multifunctional character of resource that manages using all its products and services on sustainable way (National forest policy and strategy, NN 120 / 03). This process needs to be welcomed in private forest sector as well. Beside timber there are number of non-wood forest products and services provided by forests. Non-wood forest products and services comprises different forest fruits, mushrooms, handicrafts from wooden and non wooden material, and especially social services like recreation, tourism, hunting, etc. (Sabadi et al. 2005). More intensive use of non-wood forest products and services opens number of possibilities for development of micro, small and medium entrepreneurships which can foster economical development in rural areas. For the purpose of better understanding of existing level of usage and development possibilities based on this products, under the Project: “Identifying of values of non- wood forest products and services and possibilities of its use” financed by <b>Croatian</b> <b>forests</b> ltd. co on field of its Forest District Karlovac covering area of Peters’ mountain, this investigation has been conducted on citizens of tree municipalities: Topusko, Vojnić and Gvozd. The aim was to find out how local citizens recognized forest functions and its products and services, and are they use them and how. Special aim was to find out presence of interest for starting the entrepreneurship among local citizens. For method the interview face-to-face using semi-structured questionnaire was chosen. Peters’ mountain is area traditionally forestry oriented but recently also known as recreational area with more expressed social services. Project is realized in cooperation of Forest research institute, Jastrebarsko, Department for forest management and forestry economics, <b>Croatian</b> <b>forests</b> ltd. co Forest District Karlovac and postgraduate student from Paris 12 University. Additionally this project will result with two master theses. Presented results showing that this type of research, beside all its difficulties and imperfections provide valuable information and good basis for objective assessment of non-wood forest products and services use, as well existing interest for starting private entrepreneurship. Level of non-wood forest products usage can be assessed as high with prevailing use of mushrooms (76, 0 %), followed by forests’ fruits (51, 4 %), honey (25, 5 %) and medicinal plants (20, 2 %) (table 1). In case of recognition of forest functions’ importance, the most important is timber production function (79, 3 %), second is health (67, 3 %), and non-wood forest products (50, 5 %). Beside the strong recognition of productive forest function important is to stress very strong recognition of social forest functions. Majority of respondents (60 %) visiting forest often, 42 % of them even during Winter, and most frequently chosen reasons for visit are leisure and entertainment (41, 3 %), health (36, 5 %) and sport and recreation (21, 2 %) (table 3). The frequency of visits, and interest for sport and recreation growing with achieved level of education and household income. Visitors while they are in forests most often picking forests’ fruits (75 %), walk (64, 9 %) or observe wildlife (31, 7 %). Concerning their satisfaction with situation in forest and offer 45, 3 % are completely satisfied, 42, 2 % are partially satisfied and only 12, 5 % are not satisfied at all. Level of satisfaction has reverse proportionality with level of education and household incomes. Interest for starting private entrepreneurship is studied using model of logistic regression which put some light of direction and strength of influence of investigated variables on one Yes/No question. Results revealed that private forest owners has 2, 6 times bigger willingness for starting the entrepreneurship than other population (table 2). On appearance of positive answer on that question use of non-wood forest products has positive influence. Based on results gained the average possible private entrepreneur can be described as private forest owner which use forest fruits for private purpose but also for sale, he has low level of education and low household income. In addition he is not enough informed on possibilities and existing development programs, he expecting primarily financial help from local authorities but also additional training; and he is not very keen to affiliate with other entrepreneurs. On those findings clear need for more intensive influence of local authorities and Forest Extension Service is stressed out. Main areas of work could be raising awareness on possibilities for improving private forest estate, starting private entrepreneurship based on intensified use of forest products and services. Those activities has to be facilitated by Forest Extension Service but also by <b>Croatian</b> <b>forests</b> ltd. co which can act as motivator or work in cooperation with new private entrepreneurs...|$|E

S obzirom na važnost problema u svijetu te potencijalne opasnosti za hrvatsko šumarstvo, cilj istraživanja bio je utvrditi prisutnost vrsta roda Phytophthorau Hrvatskoj i procijeniti kolika je opasnost za njihovo širenje. Istraživanja su obavljena na bukvi u područjuUŠP Bjelovar i klonovima euroameričkih topola na području UŠP Osijek. Na bukvi je nađena P. cambivora, a na topolamaP. cambivoraiP. ganopodyides. PojavaP. cambivorana bukvi vezana je uz klimatska odstupanja od prosjeka izmjenom ekstremnog sušnog i vlažnog razdoblja. Kod topola je od nađenih vrstaPhytophthoraponajprije stradao klon 275 / 81, također kao posljedica klimatskih odstupanja. The genus Phytophthora, {{belongs to}} the Oomycota, parasitizes on many species of woody plants, causing decay of roots which is often {{followed}} by climatic extremes. Phytophthora spores can survive in soil for several years waiting for optimal conditions for germination, zoosporangium is formed, from which zoospores are released. The zoospores are chemotactic swimmers which actively find tree fine roots that become infected. The disease develops over a long number of years, but certain factors can significantly speed up the decline of trees. Bleeding lesions on the trunk (Figure 1 – 3), increasing {{of the amount of}} dead branches, and lack of lateral shoots are typical symptoms ofPhytophthorainfection which was registered on two different tree species in Croatia (Fagus sylvaticaandPopulus x euroamericana). The consequence was a reduction of surface of leaves or the decline of vitality, and ultimately death of the tree. Given the importance of the problem in the world, and the potential dangers of <b>Croatian</b> <b>forests,</b> the aim {{of this study was to}} determine the presence of Phytophthora species in Croatia, and to assess the threat of their expansion. Investigations were carried out in Bjelovar and Osijek area in beech and poplar euro-american clones (Table 1). Samples of bark and soil were taken from trees with clear symptoms of the disease, and analysed in the laboratory. Parts of the samples were transferred to culture media (PDA, V 8), and molecular analysis of suspected isolates was performed (Figure 5). Soil samples were processed by immersing in water, and pears, young leaves of oak, rhododendron young leaves and fresh apples were used as baits. The obtained samples were processed by surface sterilization and placed on several types of culture media, as mentioned above. Obtained pure cultures (isolates) were analyzed by molecular tehnics. The results show that the presence of P. cambivorawas confirmed on beech andP. cambivoraandP. ganopodyideson poplar. The occurrence of P. cambivorais related to changes of extreme dry and wet periods (Figure 6).

A questionnaire on work environment and working ability was conducted in the year 2012 and included machinery operators employed in the state forestry company <b>Croatian</b> <b>Forest</b> Ltd. and in private forestry companies. Descriptive statistics and comparisons have been carried out regarding work ability index and frequency response of the respondents. The first part of the results presents a) profile of respondents b) organization of operators’ work activities and their education, c) impact of tiredness and d) impact of psychological and social factors on operators’ work ability. The second part of the results presents a) work ability results in relation to demographic categories of respondents and b) examination of differences between work ability indexes by groups of descriptive variables. Regarding the educational aspect of the sampled machine operators, the results showed insufficient level of adequate specialized education. Higher level of mental demands required to perform the job was rated with the operators employed in private companies. Demographic parameters of the respondents negatively affect the working and functional ability of forestry machine operators, and the value of operators’ WAI decreased considerably within the groups depending on work experience in the private forestry sector...|$|R

It is mainly focused on pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.), a tree species that {{plays an important}} economic role. Desiccation tolerant (xerotolerant) fungi are taxonomically and ecologically very poorly known ecological group of fungi. They live in aerophytic synusia (dead branches and bark still attached to plant individual) extremely exposed to atmospheric and cosmic influence. These fungi normally survive complete loss of their chemically unbound water and are capable to continue with all their metabolic functions after rehydration. The aim {{of this research is}} to explore biodiversity of desiccation tolerant fungi on pedunculate oak and to determine their possible bioindication value since their ecology is very similar to lichens that are already proved to be excellent bioindicators (e. g. for detection of air pollution and other anthropogenic influence, overall habitat quality assessment etc.). The present research is performed both in the field on the selected plots (sampling) and in the laboratory where morphological, cytological, histological, ecological and biostatistical methods are applied. Quantitative biodiversity analysis will be conducted by determining species-area relationships and spatial modelling of biodiversity parameters as a function of environmental variables. Preliminary results based on 6 plots on selected locality show relatively high biodiversity of fungi with 40 identified species from overall 760 collections. They belong to the orders Helotiales, Orbiliales, Mycocaliciales, Rhytismatales, Dothideales, Lecanorales, Sordariales and Xylariales...|$|R

Uz uobičajene terestričke načine prikupljanja podataka, podaci o šumama sve se više prikupljaju i metodama daljinskih istraživanja, čijom se primjenom smanjuje opseg terenskog rada te otvara mogućnost uštede vremena i novca. Cilj rada je dati pregled dosadašnjih istraživanja te mogućnosti primjene metoda daljinskih istraživanja u inventuri šuma u Hrvatskoj. Dosadašnja istraživanja prikazana u radu dat će uvid u sadašnje stanje i ulogu daljinskih istraživanja u inventuri šuma u Hrvatskoj, a zajedno s novim spoznajama mogu poslužiti kao smjernice za buduća istraživanja i primjenu novih metoda daljinskih istraživanja u inventuri šuma. Making correct {{decision}} in forest management {{is based on}} the quality of the collected information. Collection information from forests is the main task of the forest inventory. Due to the rapid development of technology, in the second half of the 20 th century, there have been major changes in the way of data collection, particularly in developed countries. In addition to conventional terrestrial methods of data collection, data on forests is increasingly being collected with remote sensing methods. Using remote sensing methods leads to reducing the scope of the fieldwork, and opens the possibility of saving time and money. In this paper was given the review of previous research and results of application of remote sensing methods in <b>Croatian</b> <b>forest</b> inventory. Previous researches presented in this paper will give insight into the current status and role of remote sensing in <b>Croatian</b> <b>forest</b> inventory, and along with some new findings may serve as guidelines for future research and application of new methods of remote sensing in forest inventory. Various researches about applicability of remote sensing methods in forest inventory operations, primarily on aerial photographs and more recently on satellite images, were conducted in Croatia in the last 30 and more years. In all previous studies of forest damage assessments with photointerpretation on CIR aerial photographs it was proved that this method is to be equally in comparison with terrestrial methods regarding to accuracy, and much more efficient regarding to achieved speed and objectivity. Methodology suitable for operational use in inventory of forest damage was made. Periodic inventories of forest health with using remote sensing methods enable easy monitoring of changes of forest between two inventories, identification of new foci of dying trees or other damage, which is especially important in today’s changed and altered environmental conditions. Forest management inventory requires information of greater accuracy. Therefore, aerial photographs of higher spatial resolution have more important applications in relation to satellite imagery in forest management inventory. Some researches of using aerial photographs for photogrammetric measurements of stands parameters shown in this paper gave good results. Despite the above, the application of remote sensing methods in practical forest inventory has not been sufficiently utilized. Development of digital photogrammetry and ‘new’ remote sensing methods and systems such as lidar, and improving existing ones, increasing the possibilities and scope of remote sensing methods. Therefore is necessary to continuously monitor the latest developments and explore new additional possibility of their application in forest inventory...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose: Mixed {{forests of}} pedunculate oak and common hornbeamare {{among the most}} {{important}} and most recognizable forest ecosystems in Croatiawith exceptional ecological, economical and sociological significance. Stand structure of these forests can be very complex, and their development highly dynamic due to the relationships between the add-mixed tree species aswell as vertical and horizontal stand structural elements. In the contemporary management of oak-hornbeam forests in Croatia growth and yield tables of domestic authors are used. Aimof this research is to give an overview of the current state of mixed forest stands of pedunculate oak and common hornbeam in Croatia through the analysis of available information on the area extent and basic stand structural features. Furthermore, the information obtained in the research are compared with the data from the growth and yield tables of domestic authors. Materials andMethods:Database used in this research is maintained by the state-owned forest management company <b>Croatian</b> <b>Forests</b> Ltd., and is comprised of the data collected within the regular forest management. In total, 5, 060 forest stands (sub-compartments) with total area of 75, 948. 76 ha from whole area extent of pedunculate oak in Croatia were included in the analysis. Record for each stand included: phytocoenological community, forest area, stand age and age class. Width of the age classes is 20 years. Analyzed stand structural attributes were grouped for each stand by tree species (pedunculate oak, common hornbeam and other species) and as a whole, and included: stand density, basal area, volume, quadratic mean diameter and height. Finally, the shares of pedunculate oak and common hornbeam in the total basal area of each stand were calculated. Results and discussion: Total area of mixed pedunculate oak and common hornbeam forests in Croatia, according to the results of this research, amounts to 98, 364. 43 ha. Age structure of these forests is irregular, both by area, and by the number of forest stands with stands older than 80 years (5 th age class and older) dominate in the total area. Most of the stands (> 68 %) grow on 1 st site class, i. e. the best site class. Structural elements of forest stands on 1 st site class, show a large variation of the analyzed structural elements throughout the development of the stands (2 nd to 8 th age class). Highest variation is established in the shares of tree species in the total basal area of the stand. These values are under the direct influence of the growth and development of diameters at breast heights of trees of different species and of the corresponding diameter distributions. Basal area shares are also highly influenced by the silvicultural measures applied during the life-time of each particular stand. Comparison of actual stand structural attributes with the values indicated as optimal in the growth and yield tables of domestic authors revealed a high degree of discrepancy. Conclusion: As a general conclusion, {{it can be said that}} the currently used growth and yield tables only very rarely correspond with the actual state of forest stands in the field. New and improved methods of forest management planning are highly desirable at this moment in Croatian forestry...|$|E

In the selected subcompartments older than 30 years, through a diagonal survey the number of infected and non-infected trees, as well as the number of mistletoe plants on infected trees was registered. The {{intensity of}} infection was very different in the individual compartments, management units and forest offices. The spatial distribution of the intensity of infection of the sessile and pedunculate oaks with yellow mistletoe in three management units was shown. In the area of the Forest Administration Zagreb from the total number of examined sessile oak trees 14. 2 % were infected with yellow mistletoe. On the average on each of the infected trees there were 2 mistletoe plants, and the largest number on one tree was 18. The largest infection was noted in the Management Unit Zlatarske prigorske šume, of the Forest Office Zlatar (23. 9 %). In the area of the Forest Administration Koprivnica 7. 8 % of the examined sessile oak trees were infected with yellow mistletoe. On the infected trees there were 3 mistletoe plants on the average, and the largest number of plants on one tree was 11. In the Management Unit Kalnik-Kolačka, of the Forest Office Križevci, there was the largest infestation (9. 7 %). In the area of the Forest Administration Zagreb, yellow mistletoe was observed on 9. 2 % of the examined pedunculate oak trees. On the infected trees there were 2 mistletoe plants on the average, and the highest number of plants on one tree was 12. The largest infestation was found in the Management Unit Obreški lug, of the Forest Office Remetinec, where 16. 8 % of the examined trees were infected. Yellow mistletoe was present on 11. 9 % of the examined pedunculate oak trees {{in the area of the}} Forest Administration Koprivnica.

Podaci su prikupljeni pomoću dva dijelom ista upitnika, s time da se s lokalnim stanovništvom razgovaralo licem-u-lice, dok su stanovnici Karlovca svoj upitnik dobili poštom. Uz to je ocijenjena povoljnost šuma područja Petrove gore za pružanje rekreacijskih i krajobraznih usluga. Rezultati ukazuju na visok stupanj slaganja stavova ispitanika ove dvije grupe te prepoznavanje važnosti ekološke i rekreacijske usluge šuma. Također je zanimljivo da obje grupe ispitanika vrlo rado i često odlaze u šumu, najčešće radi odmora i rekreacije, kao i zdravlja, a prilikom boravka u šumi gotovo redovno sakupljaju razne plodove i proizvode. Uglavnom su zadovoljni stanjem šuma, no to zadovoljstvo opada povećanjem stupnja obrazovanja, ali nisu zadovoljni stanjem i održavanjem postojećih sadržaja u šumi. Također im nedostaju sadržaji prilagođeni osobama s posebnim potrebama. Izuzetno dobru povoljnost cijeloga područja Petrove gore za pružanjem rekreacijskih i krajobraznih usluga može se bolje koristiti u promidžbene svrhe samog rekreacijskog centra, ali i kao dobru podlogu za privatno poduzetništvo. Obje grupe su prepoznale važnost šumskih plodova i iskazale interes za njihovim sakupljanjem te korištenjem, ponajprije za osobne svrhe. Za dobivanje potpunije slike, potrebno je provesti dodatna istraživanja s posebnom pozornošću usmjerenom na posjetitelje šume.

Non-wood forests´ products were defined as group of forest fruits and mushrooms, and services as group of social forests’ services (recreation and landscape). Method chosen for analysis and interpretation of results from two different investigations was triangulation (Denzin and Lincoln 1998 i 2003). First investigation was done with population of Peters´ mountain (2007 – 2008) using face-to-face interviews (table 4), and second using questionnaire send by mail to citizens of Karlovac (table 5) as users of forest services (2009 – 2010). This method allowed us to put results from different investigations into relation with aim to get better picture and understanding of investigated phenomenon. In addition the data on forest suitability for providing forest services were collected too. Those data were used for defining forest suitability for providing recreational and landscape services to users. Results show high level of correlation between attitudes of two different groups of respondents, and significant recognition of importance of ecological, recreational and landscape forests´ services (figure 1). Another finding is that both groups of respondents very often and gladly visits forest, mostly for purpose of rest and recreation, but also for health reasons (table 7 and 9) (Vuletić et al 2009). During their visits to forest they often almost regularly collect forest fruits, and they recognized this activity as very important for them (table 8). They are also equally satisfied with state of forests. However, the level of respondents’ satisfaction decreased with increased level of education. Contrary level of satisfaction is low when it is about state and maintenance of recreational infrastructure in forests. Especially they missed adopted infrastructure for disabled people. The forests´ suitability for providing recreational and landscape services is for almost whole area of Peters´ mountain excellent and very good (table 6) and we {{see this as a}} clear sign of huge potential for developing recreational activities and for use in marketing of whole recreational area. Also this could be used to facilitate private entrepreneurship development based on use of forests’ non-wood products for which the both groups of respondents recognized the potential. The local population expresses also interest to start private entrepreneurship where those which owned they forests were more interested in it. Peters´ mountain with the recreational center “Muljava” with numerous of visitors (table 1) presents huge potential for developing recreational activities based on collection of non-wood forests´ products which will motivate their visitors to prolong their stay in forests. The existing common interest for non-wood forest products and fruits should be used and connected through possibility to sell collected fruits to some of local collectors, which could boost the private entrepreneurship in these poorly developed areas with almost non additional investments. Although, for getting the whole picture of investigated phenomenon additional research should be planned and executed giving the special attention to concrete visitors of forests and this recreational area and in second hand to private entrepreneurs to find out what are the critical factors which can initiate or foster those activities...|$|E

Iako su vrste navedenih rodova poznate kao patogeni određenih poljoprivrednih kultura i šumskih sadnica u rasadnicima, te često i u velikoj mjeri prisutne u tlima odumirućih šumskih sastojina, za sada se ne može sa sigurnošću potvrditi njihova uloga u procesu odumiranja. Narrow-leaved ash (Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl), ecologically and {{economically}} very important species of <b>Croatian</b> lowland <b>forests,</b> has been showing more prominent symptoms of dieback {{in the past}} few years. Research conducted so far has confirmed presence of the pathogenic fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus Baral, Queloz & Hosoya in the crowns and stems of the trees showing the symptoms of dieback at several locations in Croatia (Diminić 2015, Milotić et al. 2016). Since forest dieback is usually a consequence of multiple abiotic and biotic factors, research to find causes often encompass not just the above-ground parts of stands, but also the root systems and soil, where fungal-like organisms such as Phytophthora species are considered to be an important biotic factor responsible for tree mortality. The goal of this research was to detect fungal-like organisms in the soil of declining narrow-leaved ash stands in order to confirm or reject the hypothesis that pathogenic Phytophthora species have a potential role in the dieback and also to expand the knowledge about fungal-like organisms 2 ̆ 7 diversity in <b>Croatian</b> <b>forest</b> soils. Total of 30 soil samples were collected from three forest management units (ten from each) in declining narrow-leaved ash stands, around the stems of trees of different health status according to Jankowiak et al. (2014). Fungal-like organisms were isolated using the soil baiting method according to Themann and Werres (1999), with Rhododendron catawbiense Michx. and Prunus laurocerasus L. leaves used as baits. Pure mycelia cultures showing vegetative morphological features characteristic for fungal-like organisms were obtained from 24 soil samples. To confirm this, sporangia production was induced in these isolates by flooding agar discs taken from 4 - 7 days old colonies with three different non-sterile soil extracts for each (1...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: Alien {{invasive}} {{species have been}} described as an outstanding global problem. Hundreds of species are intentionally and unintentionally moved worldwide and and numbers of introductions to new habitats have been accelerated all over the world due to the increasing mobility of people and goods over the past decades. Numerous alien insect species, many of them introduced only in the last 20 years, have become successfully established in various ecosystems in Croatia. Box tree moth (Cydalima perspectalis, Lepidoptera; Crambidae) is an invasive pest recently introduced to Europe causing serious damage to ornamental box (Buxus sp.) shrubs and trees. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe the biology of box tree moth with prognosis of its future spread and damages in Croatia. Material and methods: Young larvae (first and second larval stage) and adults of box tree moth were collected in August and September 2013 in Arboretum Opeka and in Varaždin. They were brought to the entomological laboratory of <b>Croatian</b> <b>Forest</b> Research Institute where they were reared to pupae and then to moths. Results and Conclusions: The box tree moth was recorded for the first time in North Croatia in August 2013. Larvae were found defoliating box plants (B. sempervirens) in Arboretum Opeka, Vinica and they have been identified as C. prespectalis. According to damages it can be assumed that the pest has been introduced to the region earlier (in 2011 or 2012) and that the primary infection has not been detected. At least two generations per year could be assumed in Croatia in 2013. The damage done to box tree plants on the locality of study is serious. The plants have been defoliated, particularly in the lower parts. The defoliation reduced the amenity value of plants. This is the first record of this pest and its damages in Northern Croatia and it can be expected that the pest will rapidly spread to other parts of Croatia seriously damaging box plants, becoming threat to gardens and parks in Croatia...|$|R
40|$|Biljna bolest pepelnica koju uzrokuje gljiva Microsphaera alphitoides, ima snažan utjecaj u procesu sušenja hrasta. Najveća opasnost prijeti poniku i pomlatku. Iskustva šumara s područja pridolaženja hrasta lužnjaka zadnjih desetljeća su da je pepelnica jedan od bitnih čimenika preživljenja hrastovog pomlatka, {{a time i}} obnove hrastovih šuma. Iako vrlo patogena gljiva, istraživanja njezinog utjecaja na razvoj i sušenje pomlatka hrasta koja bi opravdala sredstva uložena u zaštitu, relativno su malobrojna. Cilj istraživanja je odrediti stupanj ovisnosti visinskog i debljinskog prirasta te preživljenja ponika o intenzitetu zaraze pepelnicom. Pokus je postavljen po metodi slučajnogblok rasporeda u ograđenoj površini na području Uprave Šuma Podružnica Bjelovar. Pokus je po istoj metodi postavljen i u rasadnika Hrvatskog šumarskog instituta. Sakupljeni žirovi zaštićeni su fungicidima te posijani u redove u ograđenoj površini. Na poniku zaštićenom fungicidima, u 10 sati izmjeren je intenzitet fotosinteze od 8, 31 µmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1,dok je u 14 sati izmjereno 6, 76 µmol. Na zaraženom (nezaštićenom) poniku izmjereno je u 10 sati znatno manje, 5, 38 µmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1 odnosno u 14 sati 3, 75 µmol. To rezultira znatno manjom prosječnom visinom netretiranog ponika pod zastorom krošanja (22, 62 cm), dok je prosječna visina ponika tretiranog fungicidima (25, 57 cm). Suprotno tomu, u rasadniku nezaštićene biljke imaju na kraju prve vegetacije srednju visinu 24, 82 cm, dok zaštićene nešto manju 22, 56 cm. Masovno opadanje lišća dogodilo se kod nezaštićenog ponika 12 dana ranije nego kod zaštićenog. Preživljenje nezaštićenog ponika u šumi na kraju prve godine je 78 %, dok je preživljenje zaštićenog 94 %. Preživljenje je u rasadniku približno jednako u oba tretmana. Kod nezaštićenog ponika preživjelo je 92 % biljaka, odnosno 95, 5 % kod zaštićenog. Powdery mildew as {{plant disease}} caused by the fungus species Microsphaera alphitoidesGriff et Maubl., has major impact in process of oak trees dieback. Most {{threatened}} are seedlings and saplings. Experiences from professionals in last few decades proved that within the habitat of Pedunculate oak, powdery mildew is one of important factors that affects survival rate of oak’s saplings, therefore rejuvenation of oak forests. Although fungus highly pathogenic, the researches of its influence on development and dieback of saplings {{in order to justify}} the investments in protection are relatively few. The researches targeted to determine the level of dependence between the height increment and diameter increment in relation with the survival rate of seedlings and the intensity of contamination caused by mildew, are set on research plots according to the block distribution in fenced surfaces, under the Forest District Bjelovar of the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Forests</b> Ltd. The experiment is set on the same model also in the Croatian Forest Research Institute’s nursery. The acorns collected were treated with fungicides and sawn in rows in fenced surface. In experiment two variants were tested in four repetitions; seedlings treated with anti-mildew fungicides and seedlings without any protection. After germination in one-month intervals the plots were cleaned from weed and the height increment was measured, whilst based on the surface of leaves covered with mycelia the infection caused by powdery mildew was estimated on 50 leaves sample in every plot. Fungicides were applied every 15 – 20 days depending of weather conditions. For the protection three fungicides were used: Artea 330 EC (0. 5 l / ha), Anvil 5 SC (0. 5 l /ha) and Punch 10 EW (0. 3 l / ha) all with 250 l/ha of water and 0. 2 % Sandovit surfactant. Fungicides were used in forest nurseries seven times and five times in forest. The intensity of photosynthesis was measured on infected and non-infected leaves with portable gas-exchange system Li-Cor LI- 6400. On seedlings treated with fungicides at 10. 00 hours was measured 8, 31 µmol of CO 2 m- 2 s- 1 while at 14. 00 hours was measured 6, 76 CO 2 m- 2 s- 1. On infected seedlings at 10. 00 hours was measured significantly lesser value 5, 38 µmol of CO 2 m- 2 s- 1 while at 14. 00 hours 3, 75 CO 2 m- 2 s- 1. The research results show the direct relationship between the infestation by powdery mildew and the intensity of photosynthesis with the height increment and the survival rate of seedlings. This relationship is particularly denoted inside the forest, under the canopy where average height of seedlings (Graf 4) is significantly lesser at the infected seedlings (22, 62 cm) compared with the seedlings treated by fungicides (25, 57 cm). At the infected seedlings appeared massive defoliation 12 days earlier than at the uninfected. The survival rate of infected seedlings (Graf 7) in the forest {{at the end of the}} 1 st year is 78 % while the survival of treated seedlings is 94 %. In opposition inside the nursery (Graf 5) the infected plants have average height of 24, 82 cm at the end of first vegetation, while treated are relatively smaller 22, 56 cm. The survival rate in the nursery (Graf 6) is approximately equal in both treatments, at the infected seedlings 92 % comparing to 95, 5 % at the uninfected...|$|E

Prisutnost gubara različitog intenziteta u 2002. godini zabilježena je na 58 458 ha šuma, 2003. godine na 84 409, 56 ha, a 2004. godine na 149 153, 39 ha. Na temelju procjene brojnosti u jesen 2004. godine, u proljeće 2005. godine očekivala se povećana brojnost ove vrste, te su organizirane mjere zaštite na ukupnoj površini od 31 304 ha šuma kojima gospodare Uprave šuma Podružnice Vinkovci, Osijek, Našice, Zagreb, Sisak i Nova Gradiška. Tijekom 2005. godine, za suzbijanje gubara korišteni su sljedeći preparati: Foray 48 B (22 311 l), Match 050 EC (6 229 l), Karate 2, 5 EC (2 525 l), Decis 2, 5 EC (884 l) i Dimilin SC 48 (210 l). Na temelju cijene preparata, njegovog utroška po jedinici površine (ha) te cijene rada zrakoplova, trošak suzbijanja po jedinici površine za korištene preparate iznosio je: 488, 00 kn/ha (Foray 48 B); 234, 00 kn/ha (Match 0, 5 EC); 242, 00 kn/ha (Dimilin SC 48); 106, 00 kn/ha (Decis 2, 5 EC) i 99, 00 kn/ha (Karate 2, 5 EC). Trošak suzbijanja gubara tijekom 2005. godine (ukupno sve tretirane površine u Republici Hrvatskoj) iznosio je 6106190, 00 kn ili prosječno 195, 06 kn/ha. The {{gypsy moth}} (Lymantria dispar L.) is a {{polyphagous}} pest {{that in the}} caterpillar stage causes defoliation (eating leaves) on the following tree species: common oak (Quercus robur L.), European hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L.), poplars (Populus spp.) willows (Salix spp.), alders (Alnus spp.), plums (Prunus spp.), apples (Malus spp.) and others. At the time of massive appearances, they can damage tree leaves over a large area. In the past 60 years, several large gradations of this type were recorded in the following periods: 1945 – 1950, 1953 – 1956, 1963 – 1967, 1969 – 1975 and 2002 – 2005. Defoliation damage is manifested in {{the reduction of the}} growth interval and the lack of fruit. In the case of total defoliation, the growth interval can be reduced up to 30 %. In the event that the leaves appearing after defoliation are destroyed by the powdery oak mildew (Microsphaera alphitoides Griff. et Maubl.), it has been established that the reduction of the growth interval is even greater, thereby creating the conditions for massive forest drying. Forest protection tasks, one of the core activities of the state-held company <b>Croatian</b> <b>Forests</b> d. o. o. Zagreb, are organized in a three tier system (Direction, District forest management, forest district), in which each level has clearly defined tasks as prescribed by the Forests Act, the Plant Protection Act, the Fire Protection Act, general company acts and a series of other laws and by-laws. Assessments of the abundance of the gypsy moth in the forests of Croatia have been carried out by determining the abundance of egg masses along a diagonal line laid down in the forest stand. The intensity of representation is divided into five degrees depending on the percentage of trees on which egg masses are recorded. In 2002, the presence of the gypsy moth was recorded of varying intensity on 58, 458 ha of forest, in 2003 on 84, 409. 56 ha, and in 2004 on 149, 153. 39 ha. Based on the abundance assessment for autumn 2004, the assumption was that the abundance of this species was expected to rise in spring 2005, and protection measures were organized on an overall area of 31, 304 ha of forests managed by the District Forest Managements of Vinkovci, Osijek, Našice, Zagreb, Sisak and Nova Gradiška. Controlling actions included the following activities: determining the areas for control, determining the method of control, preparing maps with areas where the pest was recorded, determining the type of insecticide to be used and procuring the same, determining the airport to be used, ensuring a sufficient number of transport vehicles for the supply of insecticide and personnel to the airport and informing the public (particularly bee-keepers) of the time of implementing the activities. The decision to use certain substances was made based on the following criteria: percentage of trees where egg batches were recorded (intensity of the “attack”), status of individual stands (whether they lie in a protected area or not), the available quantity of all types of protective measures, meteorological conditions, technical aircraft equipment and a study of caterpillar development. Pursuant to these criteria, the following substances were used to control gypsy moths in 2005 : Foray 48 B (22, 311 l), Match 050 EC (6, 229 l), Karate 2. 5 EC (2, 525 l), Decis 2. 5 EC (884 l) and Dimilin SC 48 (210 l). Based on the price of the substance, its consumption per unit area (ha) and the aircraft costs, the control costs per unit area by substance were: 488 HRK/ha (Foray 48 B); 234 HRK/ha (Match 0. 5 EC); 242 HRK/ha (Dimilin SC 48); 106 HRK/ha (Decis 2. 5 EC) and 99 HRK/ha (Karate 2. 5 EC). The costs of controlling gypsy moth during 2005 (the total of all treated areas in the Republic of Croatia) totalled 6, 106, 190 HRK or an average of 195. 06 HRK/ha, regardless of the type of substance used. To determine the success of the control measures, visual observation and the method of setting up control plates were used...|$|E

The research was carried out in selected subcompartments of more than 30 years of age, in which the number of infected and non-infected trees, {{as well as the}} number of mistletoe shrubs on infected trees, was recorded through a diagonal survey. On the sessile oak yellow mistletoe was found in the area of 7 forest offices: Bjelovar, Garešnica, Sirač, Virovitica, Pakrac, Suhopolje and Vrbovec. In total 9 management units, 144 compartments and 13, 971 trees, of which 3 % were infected with mistletoe, were surveyed. On the average there were 2 mistletoe shrubs on the infected trees, and the highest number of shrubs on one tree was 17. In the area of the forest office Daruvar and Lipik no mistletoe was observed, whereas {{in the area of the}} forest office Đulovac only white mistletoe was observed on common fir trees. The least infestation was noted in two management units (MU) of the Forest Office Garešnica: MU Garjevica 0. 3 % and MU Dišnica-Zobikovac-Petkovača 0. 5 %. An infestation of less than 2 % was also found in the MU Pakračka gora-Zapadni Papuk, Forest Office Pakrac (1. 7 %). Then the MU Javornik, Forest Office Sirač with 4. 3 %, follows, and the MU Vrbovečke prigorske šume, Forest Office Vrbovec with 4. 8 % and the MU Krnjača-Gradina-Sječa, Forest Office Garešnica with 6. 0 % of infestation. In the area of Bilogora the infestation was higher and it amounted to 7. 4 % for the MU Virovitička Bilogora of the Forest Office Virovitica, 10. 0 % for the MU Suhopoljska Bilogora of the Forest Office Suhopolje, and 14. 0 % for the MU Bjelovarska Bilogora of the Forest Office Bjelovar, which is at the same time the highest infestation on the sessile oak in a given management unit. Yellow mistletoe was found on the pedunculate oak in the area of 8 forest offices: Bjelovar, Čazma, Garešnica, Grubišno Polje, Suhopolje, Velika Pisanica, Veliki Grđevac and Vrbovec. The research was carried out in 19 management units and 173 compartments on a specimen of 12. 711 trees. Out of the total number of investigated trees, 7 % were infested with mistletoe. On the infested trees there were 3 mistletoe shrubs on the average, and the highest number of shrubs on one tree was 22. In the MU Česma of the Forest Office Vrbovec no mistletoe was observed. Up to 5 % of the infested were found in the MU Dišnica-Zobikovac-Petkovača (0. 5 %) and the MU Međuvode-Ilovski lug (1. 8 %) of the Forest Office Garešnica, then the MU Česma of the Forest Office Bjelovar (3. 0 %), the MU Zdenački gaj-Prespinjača of the Forest Office Grubišno Polje (4. 2 %), the MU Krnjača-Gradina-Sječa of the Forest Office Veliki Grđevac (4. 7 %) and two management units of the Forest Office Vrbovec, MU Bolčansko-žabljački lug (3. 0 %) and MU Novakuša-Šikava (2. 2 %). Between 5 and 10 % of the infested trees were found in the MU Bolčansko-žabljački lug of the Forest Office Bjelovar (5. 6 %), MU Krnjača-Gradina-Sječa of the Forest Office Garešnica (7. 0 %), MU Dugački gaj-Jasenova-Drljež of the Forest Office Velika Pisanica (9. 6 %), MU Čazmanske nizinske šume of the Forest Office Čazma (8 %) and MU Suhopoljske virovitičke nizinske šume of the Forest Office Suhopolje (9. 7 %). Between 10 and 20 % of the investigated trees were infested with mistletoe in the MU Bjelovarska Bilogora of the Forest Office Bjelovar (15. 1 %) and the MU Trupinski-Pašijanski gaj of the Forest Office Veliki Grđevac (12. 3 %). On more than 20 % of the investigated trees mistletoe was found in the MU Trupinski-Pašijanski gaj of the Forest Office Garešnica (21. 5 %), MU Bedenik of the Forest Office Bjelovar (24. 6 %) and the MU Pisanička Bilogora of the Forest Office Velika Pisanica (24. 6 %). The highest infestation was noted in the MU Varoški lug of the Forest Office Vrbovec (30. 5 % of the investigated trees). White mistletoe was found on 36 % of investigated white poplar trees (Forest Office Virovitica), on 12 % of investigated common locust trees (Forest Office Bjelovar), as well as on 2. 4 % of investigated sessile oak trees (Forest Office Garešnica). The occurrence of white mistletoe on autochthonous European oaks is very rare, and the MU Garjevica of the Forest Office Garešnica is the only locality in Croatia in which it has been found so far. For the sessile and pedunculate oak the correlation between the occurence of yellow mistletoe and the site and stand parameters: site quality, expositionure, soil type, age, crown closure and elevation was analyzed. A positive correlation between the tree age and mistletoe infestation could be established, as well as a negative correlation between the elevation and the infestation with yellow mistletoe. The infestation is also influenced by the crown closure, and subcompartments with a very dense and dense crown closure are considerably less infested than subcompartments with an incomplete or discontinued crown closure. The spacial arrangement of the infestation intensity of the sessile and pedunculate oak with yellow mistletoe in particular management units is shown...|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose: The {{estimation}} of forest woody biomass {{has a significant}} role in forestry due to several reasons. One of the reasons is that good woody biomass estimation is important for the planning of forest woody assortments production, for main commercial roundwood assortment and for assortments like »waste wood« or »recovered wood« as a potential for electricity (heat) generation (firewood, wood bricks, wood pellets etc.). Economic and political meaning of woody biomass estimation is important to know forest biomass resources in the country and present these facts to international institutions or in treaties as needed. The estimation is also important for strategic planning of the use of renewable energy sources from woody biomass. On the other hand, {{estimation of}} the carbon content in forest woody biomass has importance in global climatemitigation policy and processes (Kyoto- and post-Kyoto period). The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present methodology applied for estimation of forest woody biomass and its carbon content according to main tree components, on the forest stand scale. Material and Methods: As research area, two representative <b>Croatian</b> <b>forest</b> communities/stands were selected. The one represents flooded lowland pedunculate oak forest of Pokupski Basin, and the other represents mountain fir-beech forest of the Gorski Kotar region. Emphasis in the paper is on themethodology which was developed for the purpose of research. The methods applied in this study consist of: a) dendrometrical measurements on selected forest stands (research sites), b) sampling of main tree components and sample analyses in laboratory, and c) calculation of forest woody biomass and its carbon content according to main tree components. Results: General result of the laboratory analyses of the samples of main tree componets is that the carbon content in biomass was around 50, 0 % of the dry matter of a component. In line with volume allocation of main tree components are the biomass of tree components and the content of carbon sequestered in these components. Stem had the largest share in total tree biomass while foliage or needle biomass had the smallest share. The shares of main tree components in total biomass of the tree depend on morphology each of tree species. Conclusion: This research was a pilot and pioneering research of <b>forest</b> biomass in <b>Croatian</b> forestry, and it should be continued to acquire better knowledge of relations in forest woody biomass in main forest communities in Croatia...|$|R

The train had not been {{more than an hour}} on its journey when the cotton-wool clouds commenced to dissolve in a blinding downpour of snowflakes. The forest trees {{on either side of the}} line were speedily coated with a heavy white mantle, the telegraph wires became thick glistening ropes, the line itself was buried more and more completely under a carpeting of snow, through which the not very powerful engine ploughed its way with increasing difficulty. The Vienna-Fiume line is scarcely the best equipped of the Austrian State railways, and Abbleway began to have serious fears for a breakdown. The train had slowed down to a painful and precarious crawl and presently came to a halt at a spot where the drifting snow had accumulated in a formidable barrier. The engine made a special effort and broke through the obstruction, but in the course of another twenty minutes it was again held up. The process of breaking through was renewed, and the train doggedly resumed its way, encountering and surmounting fresh hindrances at frequent intervals. After a standstill of unusually long duration in a particularly deep drift the compartment in which Abbleway was sitting gave a huge jerk and a lurch, and then seemed to remain stationary; it undoubtedly was not moving, and yet he could hear the puffing of the engine and the slow rumbling and jolting of wheels. The puffing and rumbling grew fainter, as though it were dying away through the agency of intervening distance. Abbleway suddenly gave vent to an exclamation of scandalised alarm, opened the window, and peered out into the snowstorm. The flakes perched on his eyelashes and blurred his vision, but he saw enough to help him to realise what had happened. The engine had made a mighty plunge through the drift and had gone merrily forward, lightened of the load of its rear carriage, whose coupling had snapped under the strain. Abbleway was alone, or almost alone, with a derelict railway waggon, in the heart of some Styrian or <b>Croatian</b> <b>forest.</b> In the third-class compartment next to his own he remembered to have seen a peasant woman, who had entered the train at a small wayside station. “With the exception of that woman,” he exclaimed dramatically to himself, “the nearest living beings are probably a pack of wolves.” ...|$|R
