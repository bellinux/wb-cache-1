Driving patterns of vehicles on a road are modeled as stochastic hybrid systems. In order to track the maneuvering vehicles, two kinematic models are derived: A constant velocity model for linear motions and a constant-speed turn model for <b>curvilinear</b> <b>motions.</b> For the constant-speed turn model, an UKF is used because of the drawbacks of the extended Kalman filter in nonlinear systems. The suggested algorithm reduces the root mean squares error for linear motions and rapidly detects possible turning motions...|$|R

Freyd Finke, 1984; Hubbard Bharucha, 1988; Verfaillie & d'Ydewalle, 1991). Here, we replicate this effect for <b>curvilinear</b> <b>motions,</b> showing that the compatibility with human movements, as expressed by the two-thirds power law (cf. Lacquaniti, Terzuolo, Viviani, 1983; Viviani, 2002), specifically contribute to this anticipation error. Thus, the compatibility effect does not manifest itself solely in an overshooting of the judged vanishing position {{in comparison to the}} objective vanishing position, but also in a more accurate anticipation of the curvilinearity of the forthcoming motion. The latter effect only occurred for spatially unpredictable target motions. Spatially more predictable target motions allowed for a different kind of anticipation, which overrode the compatibility effect. The results are discussed with regard to the notion of an action-related influence on motion perception...|$|R
40|$|The {{real-world}} tracking applications meet {{a number}} of difficulties caused {{by the presence of}} different kinds of uncertainty - unknown or not precisely known system model and random processes’ statistics or due to abrupt changes in the system modes of functioning. These problems are especially complicated in the marine navigation practice, where the commonly used simple models of rectilinear or <b>curvilinear</b> target <b>motions</b> do not match to the highly non-linear dynamics of the manoeuvring ship motion. A solution of these problems is to derive more adequate descriptions of the real ship dynamics and to design adaptive estimation algorithms. After analysis of basic hydrodynamic models, new ship models are derived in the paper. They are implemented in two versions of the recently very popular Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) algorithm. The first one is a standard IMM version using preliminary defined fixed structure (FS) of models. They represent various modes of ship motion, distinguished by their rate of turns. The same rate of turn is additionally adjusted in the proposed new augmented versions of the IMM (AIMM) algorithm by using FS and variable structure (VS) of adaptive models estimating the current change of the system control parameters. The obtained Monte Carlo simulation results show that the VS AIMM algorithm outperforms the FS AIMM and FS IMM algorithms with respect to accuracy and adaptability...|$|R

40|$|A new multiple-model filter {{for target}} {{tracking}} {{has been developed}} and performed well in this thesis. The procedure of the new multiple model (MM) filter has no compromises between non-manoeuvre and manoeuvre, and between manoeuvres except in the ambiguous cases. The operation of the new MM filter is simple like VD filter but with no need for reconstruction of manoeuvre, and the new MM filter also considers all kinds of motions like interacting multiple model (IMM) filter but with {{a small number of}} models and significantly reduced computational load. The scheme of the new multiple-model tracking filter consists of manoeuvre detection, construction of manoeuvre filters, construction of safeguard filter, and filter selection. The performance of the proposed tracking filter mainly relies on manoeuvre detection, construction of manoeuvre model filter, and construction of safeguard model filter. In order to improve the tracking, several manoeuvre detection methods have been developed. One of the manoeuvre detection methods is to test the statistic of normalised optimally squared smoothed accelerations, and gives quicker detection than classical manoeuvre detection by testing normalised squared-innovation statistic, in spite of the smoothing lag. This thesis suggests that the manoeuvre be detected by testing the changes of the statistic of normalised squared innovations to give effective manoeuvre detection, based on Chen and Norton's (1986) detection by testing rapid parameter changes. The thesis also modifies Weston and Norton's (1997) change detection with the fixed-lag smoothing instead of the fixed-interval smoothing used by Weston and Norton's method, and obtains more accurate and quicker manoeuvre detection. According to the features of target motion, the target manoeuvres are modelled as straight-line acceleration motion, cross-track acceleration <b>motion,</b> and <b>curvilinear</b> acceleration <b>motion.</b> Thus the manoeuvre model filters can be constructed by these three kinds of motions with a limited number of manoeuvre model filters and reduced computational load. To avoid the risk of the loss of track, a safeguard filter is used in the case of uncertain manoeuvre. The safeguard filter is constructed by combining Singer's (1970) filter and input estimation, to provide at least comparable performance to IMM filter. Further improvement for multiple-model tracking is provided by using the fixed-lag smoothing technique. In comparison with the multiple-model filter alone, the fixed-lag smoothing multiple-model filter provides much better performance (even with fixed lag d= 1), and can be implemented in a real time at the costs of a small delay and slight increase in computational load...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of both differential and algebraic equations {{in the model}} equations, {{as well as the}} number of degrees of freedom needed to accurately represent flexibility, prohibit fast simulation of flexible multibody systems (e. g. real-time). In this research the capabilities for fast simulation, of the model reduction technique for multibody systems Global Modal Parameterization (GMP) [1] are investigated. The reduction of the model is achieved by projection on a judiciously chosen <b>curvilinear</b> subspace: the <b>motion</b> of the multibody system is expressed in terms of its dominant, system-level, configuration-dependent eigenmodes and static deformation patterns. The system is thus represented by a curvilinear coordinate system that maps the subspace spanning the dominant dynamic phenomena. The coordinate axes of this curvilinear coordinate system are defined by the eigenmodes and static deformation patterns incorporated in the GMP-mode set. As opposed to a fixed vector space, using a curvilinear reduction subspace requires significantly less degrees of freedom to represent the system’s dynamics with the same level of accuracy [2] [3], which is a significant step towards faster simulation of flexible multibody systems. When eigenfrequencies converge in the configuration space, Mode Veering or Mode Crossing occurs. These phenomena cause strong gradients or, in the case of Mode Crossing, even discontinuities in the eigenmodes throughout the configuration space. This results in strongly curved or even discontinuous coordinate axes for the reduced model, such that difficulties are to be expected. The numerical experiments in this work indeed show that the strong gradients of the eigenmodes linked to Mode Veering imposes the use of a fine discretization space, limiting the advantages of GMP. For cases exhibiting Mode Crossing, the GMP-description fails altogether. This paper discusses opportunities to overcome this problem. The vector space spanned by veering or crossing modes is continuous throughout the configuration space as opposed to the individual vectors themselves. This enables to define continuously varying vectors to be used as the coordinate axes of the curvilinear coordinate system instead of the veering/crossing eigenmodes themselves. As this curvilinear coordinate system maps the same reduction subspace, the reduced model is still able to capture the same dynamical phenomena, while being relieved from its strongly curved of even discontinuous coordinate axes, making simulation of the reduced model significantly cheaper or, in the case of Mode Crossing, removing the singularity and thus enabling the use of the model reduction technique. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Soccer {{consists}} {{of many different}} types of sports specific movement. The present level of understanding of non-linear motion is negligible yet required if improvements are to be made in technique and performance of such actions. This thesis aimed to establish mechanisms for non-linear motion relevant to soccer performance. Preliminary analysis of <b>curvilinear</b> <b>motion</b> involved electromyographical analysis in selected muscles of the lower extremity at different grades of curvature. Results revealed adaptation of temporal muscle activity at the tightest grade of curvature. Adaptation occurred in both legs, but predominantly the outside leg, with increased duration of activity after footstrike (Smith et al., 1997). Stride kinematics were also altered, as increasing curve severity gave reduced stride length and increased stride frequency. Foot contact time was not changed as a function of <b>curvilinear</b> <b>motion</b> (P > 0. 05), giving an increased proportion of the stride cycle in the stance phase. Rear foot contact time increased as a function of curve severity (P $ 0. 05). To describe and quantify adaptation of lower limb movement in <b>curvilinear</b> <b>motion,</b> three-dimensional kinematics were used. Subjects (n = 8) wore soccer footwear on natural turf. Ranges of motion at the lower extremity were increased at the faster of the two velocities tested (4. 4 and 5. 4 ms·] ± 5 %), yet tended to reduce with curve severity. The inside leg displayed more differences in angular displacement with curve severity, and the ankle joint showed to be a key adaptive site. Ground reaction forces of two consecutive footfalls were performed on natural turf to assess relative contributions of the two limbs during straight and <b>curvilinear</b> <b>motion</b> at a 5 m radius. Total force over two footfalls was greater during straight motion. A mechanism of lowered centre of gravity during <b>curvilinear</b> <b>motion</b> was proposed. During <b>curvilinear</b> <b>motion</b> the outside leg was associated with greater force values in all three planes, displaying a greater contribution to <b>curvilinear</b> <b>motion.</b> Force measurements on natural turf were used to assess different sole configuration during three soccer specific moves. A modern moulded sole was found to be associated with greater maximum friction, also lower vertical ground reaction forces during a Cruyff turn and lower overall forces during the shot.

It has been argued that either oculomotor or static depth cues are necessary to disambiguate the rotational and translational components of the flow field and, thus, to support accurate heading estimation. We have re-examined this issue using visually simulated motion along a curved path towards a layout of random points as the stimulus. Our data show that, in this <b>curvilinear</b> <b>motion</b> paradigm, five of six observers could estimate their heading relatively accurately and precisely (error and uncertainty < ∼ 4 deg), even for rotation rates as high as 16 deg/sec, without the benefit of either oculomotor or static depth cues signaling rotation rate. Such performance is inconsistent with models of human self-motion estimation that require rotation information from sources other than the flow field to cancel the rotational flow.
