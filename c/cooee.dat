25|$|It was the NWFU's year to {{host the}} final, so the coastal premiers, the Wynyard Cats, {{qualified}} directly. After the disappointment of being eliminated in the 1966 coastal preliminary final after finishing the regular season as the Minor Premiers, Wynyard dominated the 1967 season. The Cats finished with a 17-1 record, with their only loss coming against Ulverstone by eight points, and they finished six wins ahead {{of the other three}} finalists: Burnie, Ulverstone and <b>Cooee.</b> They beat Burnie by 58 points in the second semi-final, and then won the Grand Final against <b>Cooee</b> by 36 points. It was Wynyard's second ever NWFU premiership, and the first time since 1957 that the flag had been won by any team other than the two Burnie-based sides (Burnie and <b>Cooee).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Some {{elements}} of Aboriginal languages {{have been adopted}} by Australian English—mainly as names for places, flora and fauna (for example dingo) and local culture. Many such are localised, and do not form part of general Australian use, while others, such as kangaroo, boomerang, budgerigar, wallaby and so on have become international. Other examples are <b>cooee</b> and hard yakka. The former {{is used as a}} high-pitched call, for attracting attention, (pronounced [...] ) which travels long distances. <b>Cooee</b> is also a notional distance: if he's within <b>cooee,</b> we'll spot him. Hard yakka means hard work and is derived from yakka, from the Jagera/Yagara language once spoken in the Brisbane region.|$|E
2500|$|During World War I, {{recruitment}} marches [...] or snowball marches {{to state}} capital cities were {{a feature of}} volunteer recruiting drives for the Australian Imperial Force in rural Australia. [...] Between October 1915 and February 1916, nine marches were held starting from various points in the state; the most notable was the first march from Gilgandra, New South Wales, known as the <b>Cooee</b> march. The March of the Dungarees took place in south-eastern Queensland in November 1915. [...] In 1918, {{in an effort to}} promote recruitment, another march was staged, but this was less spontaneous and the marchers in fact travelled by train.|$|E
25|$|During the march, the <b>Cooees</b> {{were issued}} about 50 dungarees in Dubbo, Army greatcoats in Orange and some {{additional}} dungarees in Lithgow.|$|R

2500|$|At {{the start}} of World War I, Pioneer sailed from Victoria to Western Australia, where she served as a patrol vessel. On 16 August, she {{captured}} the German merchant ship Neumunster, which {{was taken by the}} Australian government as a prize of war and renamed <b>Cooee.</b> Ten days later, the cruiser captured a second German ship, the Norddeutscher Lloyd liner Thuringen, which was presented to the government of India for use as a troop transport. On 1 November, Pioneer joined the escort of the convoy transporting the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps to Egypt as a replacement for the Japanese cruiser Nisshin, and with orders to check on the Cocos Islands during the voyage. However, as the Australian warship took up position, she suffered a major engine malfunction, and [...] joined the convoy instead.|$|E

5000|$|The word <b>cooee</b> {{has become}} a name of many organisations, places and even events. Perhaps the most {{historic}} of these was the <b>Cooee</b> March during the First World War. It was staged by 35 men from Gilgandra, New South Wales, 766 km northwest of Sydney, as a recruiting drive after enthusiasm for the war waned in 1915 with the first casualty lists. The men marched to Sydney calling [...] "Cooee!" [...] to encourage others to come and enlist. A poster read [...] "Coo-ee - Won't you come?". When they reached Sydney on 12 December, the group had grown to 277 men. To this day, Gilgandra holds a yearly <b>Cooee</b> Festival in October to commemorate the event. Other <b>Cooee</b> Festivals occur across Australia. <b>Cooee</b> is also {{the name of a}} suburb in the Tasmanian city of Burnie.|$|E

Yakka means work, strenuous labour, and comes from 'yaga' meaning 'work' in the Yagara indigenous language of the Brisbane region. Yakka {{found its way into}} nineteenth-century Australian pidgin, and then passed into Australian English. First recorded 1847.|$|E
