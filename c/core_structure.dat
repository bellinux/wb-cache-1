5|$|Sterol lipids, such as {{cholesterol}} and its derivatives, {{are an important}} component of membrane lipids, along with the glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins. The steroids, all derived from the same fused four-ring <b>core</b> <b>structure,</b> have different biological roles as hormones and signaling molecules. The eighteen-carbon (C18) steroids include the estrogen family whereas the C19 steroids comprise the androgens such as testosterone and androsterone. The C21 subclass includes the progestogens as well as the glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. The secosteroids, comprising various forms of vitamin D, are characterized by cleavage of the B ring of the <b>core</b> <b>structure.</b> Other examples of sterols are the bile acids and their conjugates, which in mammals are oxidized derivatives of {{cholesterol and}} are synthesized in the liver. The plant equivalents are the phytosterols, such as β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and brassicasterol; the latter compound is also used as a biomarker for algal growth. The predominant sterol in fungal cell membranes is ergosterol.|$|E

30|$|We {{explain in}} Section “Coupled atomistic and {{discrete}} dislocations in 3 D: core template” {{the importance of}} the core template boundary condition for CADD 3 D to successfully build the multiscale framework. In order to obtain this core template, we provide comprehensive modeling techniques to create a dislocation with arbitrary character angles (Section “Method 1 : Atomistic dislocation modeling”). We also provide an extended variational Peierls-Nabarro (PN) method [15] to validate the obtained MD <b>core</b> <b>structures</b> (Section “Method 2 : Variational Peierls-Nabarro method”). Interestingly, the extended PN method can be used to predict <b>core</b> <b>structures</b> of mixed dislocations which cannot be obtained with MD simulations due to limitation of computational cost. With the successful extension of PN method, we show favorable <b>core</b> <b>structures</b> when compared to MD, and analyze the details of dislocation <b>core</b> <b>structures</b> of all the studied character angles (Section “Results 1 : Comparison between the MD and PN models core structures”). We also measure Peierls stresses for various mixed dislocations (Section “Results 2 : Peierls stresses”), and show that Peierls stresses are largely influenced by the atomistic structures of the dislocation core. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion on future work towards a fully working implementation of CADD 3 D.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBacterial spores {{of the genera}} Bacillus and Clostridium are {{extremely}} resistant against desiccation, heat and radiation and involved in the spread and pathogenicity of health relevant species such as Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) or Clostridium botulinum. While the resistance of spores is very well documented, underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study we show, by cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections and particular resin thin section electron microscopy, that dormant Bacillus spores possess highly ordered crystalline <b>core</b> <b>structures,</b> which contain the DNA, but only if small acid soluble proteins (SASPs) are present. We found those <b>core</b> <b>structures</b> in spores of all Bacillus species investigated, including spores of anthrax. Similar <b>core</b> <b>structures</b> were detected in Geobacillus and Clostridium species which suggest that highly ordered, at least partially crystalline core regions represent a general feature of bacterial endospores. The crystalline <b>core</b> <b>structures</b> disintegrate in a period during spore germination, when resistance against most stresses is lost. Our {{results suggest that the}} DNA is tightly packed into a crystalline nucleoid by binding SASPs, which stabilizes DNA fibrils and protects them against modification. Thus, the crystalline nucleoid seems to be the structural and functional correlate for the remarkable stability of the DNA in bacterial endospores...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the study}} of Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures (BICA), {{relatively}} {{little attention has been}} paid to the evolutionary development of cognitive capabilities. There are two successful evolutionary strategies, i. e. resilient and cheap to reproduce individuals vs. more capable individuals that are necessarily expensive to reproduce. The vertebrate family is the prime example of the “evolve more capable individual” strategy. A sequence of increasingly complex and cognitively capable individuals has resulted from the vertebrate strategy. At the heart of the vertebrate strategy is a set of midbrain structures common to all vertebrates. The role of the <b>core</b> <b>structures</b> seems to be preparing the body for different classes of sensory-guided behaviors, while interactions among the <b>core</b> <b>structures</b> insure appropriate switching between behavior classes. More complex vertebrate brains evolved by adding new structures with feedback loops that link the new <b>structure</b> to the <b>core</b> <b>structures</b> and to sensory and motor processing components. A general rule for a new vertebrate structure is that it has to leave the <b>core</b> <b>structures</b> along the central midline of the brain intact, and that it cannot degrade functionality found in brains without the new structure. The evolution of two new capabilities critical to cognitive performance is discussed: the evolution from non-specific anticipation to specific prediction, and the evolution of simple combinations of landmarks into detailed models of familiar places...|$|R
