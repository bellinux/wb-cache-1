40|$|The Both {{the thermal}} spray and the {{electroplating}} coatings {{are widely used}} because of their high wear resistance combined with good corrosion resistance. In particular the addition of both micro particles or nano‐particles to the electro deposited coatings could {{lead to an increase}} of the mechanical properties, caused by the change of the coating microstructure. The thermal spray coatings were deposited following industrial standards procedures, while the Ni/SiC composite coatings were produced at laboratory scale using both micro‐and nano‐sized ceramic particles. All the produced coatings were characterized regarding their microstructure,mechanical properties and the wear resistance. The tribological properties were analyzed using a tribometer under ball on disk configuration at both room temperature and 300 oC. The results showed that the <b>cermet</b> thermal <b>spray</b> coatings have a high wear resistance, while the Ni nano‐composite showed good anti wear properties compared to the harder ceramic/cermet coatings deposited by thermal spray technique...|$|R
40|$|ISSN : 1392 - 1350 International audiencePlasma {{spraying}} {{was used}} to fabricate composite (cermet) coatings from a mixture of powders of alumina-based ceramics and stainless steel. Regarding the water-stabilized plasma spray process (WSP), the two powders were mixed in the feed container, whereas a simultaneous feeding of the powders by separate injectors (co-spraying) was carried out together with the gas-stabilized plasma spray process (GSP). Both processes belong to a family of procedures known as atmospheric plasma spraying (APS), and give rise to similar coating characteristics. The complementarity of the component mixing in the two processes was demonstrated, and the mechanical properties such as microhardness and elastic modulus of the resulting composite coatings were studied. Attention was also paid to microstructural aspects connected to wear resistance. WSP spraying of the mixed powders resulted in coatings composed of successive layers of ceramics and stainless steel, in which the relative thickness varied with the steel content. The GSP-produced cermet coating exhibited microstructures without microcracks or interconnected porosity, and such structures gave rise to good mechanical properties with respect to elastic modulus, hardness and wear resistance.

40|$|The structure, {{hardness}} and shear {{adhesion strength}} {{have been investigated}} in Cr 3 C 2 -NiCr <b>cermet</b> coatings <b>sprayed</b> onto a mild steel substrate by 200 kW high power plasma spraying (HPS) and high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) processes. Amorphous and supersaturated nickel phases form in both as-sprayed coatings. The hardness of the HVOF coating is {{higher than that of}} the HPS coating because the HVOF coating contains more non-melted Cr 3 C 2 carbide particles. On heat-treating at 873 K, the amorphous phase decomposes and the supersaturated nickel phase precipitates Cr 3 C 2 carbides so that the hardness increases in the HPS coating. The hardness measured with a large load exhibits lower values compared with that measured with a small load because of cracks generated from the indentation. The ratio of the hardnesses measured with different loads can be regarded as an index indicating the coating ductility. The ductility of the HVOF coating is higher than that of the HPS coating. Adhesion strength of the HVOF coating was high compared with the HPS coating. The adhesion of the coatings is enhanced by heat-treating at 1073 K and that of the HVOF coating was over 350 MPa...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{investigation}} of the tribological behaviour of <b>cermet</b> plasma <b>sprayed</b> coatings in fretting conditions. Low pressure plasma sprayed NiCrFeAlTi-TiC, NiCr-(Ti, Ta) C and NiCrMo-(Ti, Ta) C coatings were tested at room temperature and at 550 degrees C, against sapphire ball under gross slip conditions. Air plasma sprayed NiCr and NiCr-TiC coatings, as well as the high velocity oxy-fuel WC-Co coating, were investigated for comparison with the coatings tested in the present study. The coatings were classified with respect to wear and friction behaviour. The matrix and the carbide modifications of the NiCr-TiC coating influenced positively the coating wear and friction behaviour The wear resistance of all the coatings decreased at high temperature. The NiCrFeAlTi-TiC coating showed the best wear resistance among the TiC-based coatings. At room temperature and at 550 degrees C, the WC-Co coating was more wear resistant than the TiC-based coatings, eventhough the coating cracked in the high temperature tests. The coefficients of friction (COFs) of the WC-Co coating, tested against sapphire, were lower than the COFs of the TiC-based coatings at room temperature, but not at 550 degrees C. XRD and SEM investigation of the wear tracks gave information on the active wear mechanisms. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S. A. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{spray and}} WC-Co based {{coatings}} {{are widely used}} in areas subjected to abrasive wear. Commercial  <b>cermet</b> thermal <b>spray</b> powders for HVOF are relatively expensive. Therefore applying these powders in cost-sensitive areas like mining and agriculture are hindered. Nowadays, the use of cheap iron based self-fluxing alloy powders for thermal spray is limited. The aim {{of this research was}} to study properties of composite powders based on self-fluxing alloys and recycled cermets and to examine the properties of thermally sprayed (HVOF) coatings from composite powders based on iron self-fluxing alloy and recycled cermet powders (Cr 3 C 2 -Ni and WC-Co). To estimate the properties of  recycled cermet powders, the sieving analysis, laser granulometry and morphology were conducted. For deposition of coatings High Velocity Oxy-Fuel spray was used. The structure and composition of powders and coatings were estimated by SEM and XRD methods. Abrasive wear performance of coatings was determined and compared with wear resistance of coatings from commercial powders. The wear resistance of thermal sprayed coatings from self-fluxing alloy and recycled cermet powders at abrasion is comparable with wear resistance of coatings from commercial expensive spray powders and may be an alternative in tribological applications in cost-sensitive areas.

40|$|The {{incentive}} {{is strong}} for optimising sliding materials {{to reduce the}} risk for scuffing. In this study, scuffing tests were performed aiming towards finding new piston ring materials for greener marine diesel engines and also towards understanding scuffing mechanisms better. The tested ring materials where grey iron, Stellite 6, plasma <b>sprayed</b> <b>cermet</b> and high velocity oxy fuel (HVOF) cermet (both cermets with the same compounds: Cr-carbide, Ni, Cr, Mo). The Stellite 6 and HVOF cermet performed somewhat better than the other two materials. Microscopic and spectroscopic studies of failed sample surfaces revealed several characteristic features. It was clear that different mechanisms are active simultaneously, at different parts of the samples. Based on these results, we propose a hypothesis for a scuffing process involving several stages with distinctive mechanisms. Further studies are needed to strengthen this hypothesis and to relate these findings to actual deterioration mechanisms in the engine...|$|R
40|$|Thermal <b>spraying</b> of <b>cermet</b> {{coatings}} {{is widely}} used for protection of machined parts against wear and corrosion. These coatings consist of WC particles in metal binders such as Co, Cr, and Ni. In this study, three kinds of WC powders with different metal binders (Co, NiCr and CoCr) were sprayed by low power plasma spray system on Al-Si-Cu alloy substrate. Fundamental aspects of <b>sprayed</b> <b>cermet</b> coatings, including (i) the effects of binder type on the coating structure, (ii) the microhardness properties and (iii) the microstructure were investigated. All the cermet coatings had the same phase structure such as WC and W 2 C. However, the phase intensities of these phases are different in each coating, mainly due to the different in solidification rate in each case. Moreover, the microhardness measurements {{were found to be}} different in each coating. The results show that the binder type has a significance effect of the physical and mechanical properties of the sprayed coatings...|$|R

In the paper, nanostructured, {{multimodal}} {{and conventional}} WC- 12 Co <b>cermet</b> coatings were <b>sprayed</b> by HVOF and the properties and {{structures of the}} coatings such as microhardness, microstructure, phase composition were compared. Finally sand solid and slurry erosion wear tests were carried out and their wear failure mechanisms were explored by XRD and SEM analysis. Research results show that microstructures of nanostructured and multimodal WC- 12 Co coatings prepared by HVOF are dense with little porosity, and their microhardness values are obviously higher than conventional WC- 12 Co coating. As well, {{it was found that}} nanostructured and multimodal WC- 12 Co coatings exhibited better sand solid and slurry erosion wear resistance in comparison with conventional coating and nanostructured WC- 12 Co coatings possessed the best sand solid erosion resistance properties at large impact angles and slurry erosion wear resistance. Testing results also show that although decarburization of WC occurred during spraying multimodal and nanostructured WC- 12 Co powders, the decarburization of WC for the nanostructured powder was more severe...|$|R
40|$|Optimising sliding {{materials}} of marine two-stroke diesel engine cylinders for reduced risk of scuffing is imperative {{because of the}} high costs associated with replacing the cylinder liner. But how can a complex and poorly understood phenomenon such as scuffing be tested? This study investigates the potential of material selection based on lab tests. Experience from ship operation is combined with analysis of lab scale scuffing tests to evaluate the possibilities of gaining applicable knowledge from scuffing testing. Two piston ring materials, a grey cast iron and a plasma <b>sprayed</b> <b>cermet</b> coating, both currently used in engines, were tested. Each of the materials was tested with two surface characters, achieved by run-in in a real engine and by fine grinding respectively. The ranking of the two materials proved to differ between the two surface characters. In the tests, scuffing could only be detected when all oil had become removed from the contact by being adsorbed by agglomerated wear debris and scraped away. This and other critical mechanisms behind scuffing in the tests are thoroughly discussed and compared to possible mechanisms taking place in the engine...|$|R
40|$|Conventional (micron size) WC&# 8211; 12 Co {{coatings}} were sprayed on {{stainless steel}} substrate with low power plasma spraying process. The plasma torch was designed such that the powder can be sprayed at low power plasma (3. 9 &# 8211; 9. 1 kW) and internally injected by carrier gas in the region between the anode and cathode. The <b>cermet</b> powders were <b>sprayed</b> via this new technique at different plasma power (3. 9 &# 8211; 9. 1 kW). The results show that, at low power (3. 9 kW), the main structure of the coatings is composed of WC grains. However, beside WC, W 2 C phase has been detected in coatings sprayed at high plasma power (5 &# 8211; 9 kW). On the other hand, intensity of WC peak decreased and that of W 2 C increased as the plasma power was increased. The influence of plasma power on the coatings hardness has been investigated. The {{results indicated that the}} coatings hardness increased and reached about 1500 HV at plasma power of 6. 5 kW. Over this power value, the hardness of the coatings slightly decreased mainly due to the appearance of brittle &# 0945;-W 2 C grains...|$|R
40|$|Ni-YSZ cermets are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used electrode materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) anodes to oxidise reformed methane, a mixture of hydrogen, water, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Ni-YSZ cermet electrodes made from a mixture of 40 vol% Ni and 60 vol% yttria (8 mol%) stabilised zirkonia (8 YSZ) were investigated electrochemically in hydrogen/water (H_ 2 /H_ 2 O) and carbon monoxide/carbon dioxide (CO/CO_ 2) atmospheres in order to obtain an insight into the fundamental electrode processes. Quasi steady state current voltage measurements and impedance spectroscopy were performed in a three electrode configuration. Annular shaped Ni-YSZ cermet electrodes, screen printed on 150 #mu#m thick YSZ-electrolyte foils and circular shaped Ni-YSZ <b>cermet</b> electrodes, <b>sprayed</b> on specially designed YSZ-electrolyte pellets (Risoe- 3 electrode pellets), were used for studying the H_ 2 /H_ 2 O reaction and the CO/CO_ 2 reaction, respectively. Both electrode configurations are shown to ensure reliable electrochemical single electrode measurements. The electrode reactions for three different H_ 2 /H_ 2 O mixtures (p(H_ 2) = 0. 19 bar/p(H_ 2 O) = 0. 05 bar; p(H_ 2) = 0. 48 bar/p(H_ 2 O) = 0. 05 bar; p(H_ 2) = 0. 48 bar/p(H_ 2 O) = 0. 12 bar) were investigated {{as a function of the}} electrode potential and the temperature. Different macrokinetics are obtained in a low temperature region (725 C- 845 C) and a high temperature region (845 C-= 950 C). At 726 C the apparent reaction order of the H_ 2 -oxidation reaction for hydrogen, m_H', is close to 0. 5 and is nearly independent of the electrode potential. The apparent activation enthalpy of the H_ 2 -oxidation rate, #DELTA#H"#not =#_O_x', is 145 kJ/mol at the rest potential and decreases linearly with increasing anodic overpotential with a slope of - 0. 7 eV/V. The apparent anodic charge-transfer coefficient, #alpha#_a', in the low temperature region is approximately 0. 7, independent of temperature.

30|$|In {{electric}} arc spray process (also called as the wire arc process), a high direct-current {{is connected with}} two consumable wire electrodes which are fed into the gun. This establishes an arc between them which melts the tips of wire. Atomized molten metal is propelled towards the substrate through a stream of air. As all the input energy is used to melt the metal, therefore, the process is energy efficient [91]. Spray rates are driven mainly by operating current and vary {{as a function of}} both conductivity and melting point. Normally, materials such as iron-base and copper-base alloy sprays at 4.5  kg (10  lb)/ 100 A/h are used. Since no jet of hot air gas is directed towards the substrate, substrate temperature is low. Electric arc spraying can also be done using inert gases or in a controlled-atmospheric temperature [92]. Greater bonding strengths, lower porosity and higher spray rates are attained using flame spraying technique. However, it produces ozone, arc light and fume which may cause problems in many situations. Arc spraying has the maximum deposition rate, with rates of 15  kg/h or higher. The process offers lesser-cost coatings when compared with plasma and HVOF spraying. This is because of high deposition rates, lesser energy cost and lower material costs which is incurred compared with a wire consumable technique. Arc spraying is beneficial in metallizing thermally sensitive substrates such as capacitors and other similar electronic components because of the low heating of substrate. Two dissimilar wires can produce an intimately mixed coating which can be sprayed. Lower porosity levels can be attained by flame spraying. Arc spraying process does not make use of combustion gases or do not generate high-energy plasma, thus possessing lesser health and safety risks than other thermal spray processes [93]. This process can be used to spray only electrically conductive materials that are accessible in an appropriate wire form. It is not fit for <b>spraying</b> <b>cermet</b> or ceramics. Arc-sprayed coatings usually contain extra porosity and higher amounts of oxide and have lesser bond strengths compared with coatings deposited by HVOF and Plasma spraying [94].|$|R
