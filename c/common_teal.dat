5|$|Between {{the river}} {{mouth and the}} River Witham, a large expanse of {{saltmarsh}} provides breeding grounds for common redshank, Eurasian oystercatcher and reed bunting in the summer, and Eurasian wigeon, mallard, common shelduck and <b>common</b> <b>teal</b> in the winter. Birds of prey such as hen harrier and merlin feed on the flocks of linnet and twite, while the mudflats support dunlin, whimbrel, and bar-tailed godwit. The Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust have a reserve there, which is next to RSPB Frampton Marsh, a reserve managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.|$|E
5|$|Lafarge Aggregates owns various {{sites in}} the parish. In 1974 the village won an appeal against Pioneer Concrete's {{application}} for gravel extraction near the village. Similar events took place in March 2003 when hundreds of local residents protested against an application of gravel extraction by Lafarge. Larfarge's initial appeal, in April 2003, was turned down by West Berkshire Council. A further application to extract aggregate at the Wasing Estate was due to be decided in 2010. One former extraction site, Butts Lake Quarry, is now a nature reserve and the flooded lakes {{have been identified as}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest and is now operated by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust. The reserve contains specimens of trees such as alder, cherry, hawthorn, oak, and willow. Examples of reeds present include typha latifolia, phragmites australis, mentha aquatica, and lythrum salicaria. Numerous species of bird nest in the reserve, including the <b>common</b> <b>teal,</b> shoveler, warbler, kingfisher, water rail, and nightingale.|$|E
50|$|Another {{possibility}} is that the American lineage is derived from stray <b>common</b> <b>teals,</b> with the founder effect/genetic drift and/or hybrid introgression phenomena applying as above, only in the reverse direction for the former two. Still, this would require loss of sexual dimorphism in the ancestors of the speckled teal, but while extremely rare in dabbling ducks, it is not per se impossible.|$|R
50|$|This is the {{smallest}} North American dabbling duck. The breeding male has grey flanks and back, with a yellow rear end and a white-edged green speculum, obvious in flight or at rest. It has a chestnut head with a green eye patch. It is distinguished from drake <b>common</b> <b>teals</b> (the Eurasian relative of this bird) by a vertical white stripe on side of breast, the lack of both a horizontal white scapular stripe {{and the lack of}} thin buff lines on its head.|$|R
50|$|Both {{hypotheses}} seem rather spurious initially, {{with the}} green-winged <b>teal</b> and <b>common</b> <b>teal's</b> male nuptial plumage being unique and very complex, and {{the tendency to}} gain, not lose, strong sexual dimorphism overwhelming in the dabbling ducks. An alternative explanation given the high frequency of hybridisation in ducks {{would be that the}} mtDNA of the present-day green-winged teal is originally derived from spotted teal females by introgression and thus the molecular data gives a misleading picture of the species' true relationships. This is supported by the observation that in mallard × American black duck hybrids, females of both taxa prefer the sexually dimorphic mallard drakes over the dull-plumaged black duck drakes; that the green-winged teal is in some aspects—such as the less contrasting nuptial plumage—intermediate between the <b>common</b> and speckled <b>teal</b> is also interesting to note.|$|R
25|$|The Eurasian teal or <b>common</b> <b>teal</b> (Anas crecca) is {{a common}} and {{widespread}} duck which breeds in temperate Eurasia and migrates south in winter. The Eurasian teal is often called simply the teal due to being {{the only one of}} these small dabbling ducks in much of its range. The bird gives its name to the blue-green colour teal.|$|E
25|$|The {{variety of}} {{habitats}} at Maurice K. Goddard State Park attracts {{a variety of}} birds. Bald eagles and osprey can be seen flying over Lake Wilhelm as they scan the waters for fish. The old fields and forests are home to woodcocks, nighthawks, snipes, {{and a variety of}} warblers. Migrating waterfowl like the loon, <b>common</b> <b>teal,</b> goldeneye, merganser, and bufflehead stop by Lake Wilhelm in the spring and fall. Woodpeckers including the pileated woodpecker live in the woods of the park. Bluebirds and purple martins make their homes in the old fields and meadows of Maurice K. Goddard State Park.|$|E
25|$|The {{forest cover}} of the {{district}} has dwindled with increasing use of land for agriculture. There are areas with high prevalence of mango (Mangifera indica), mahua (Madhuca longifolia), sal (Shorea robusta), and bamboo (Bambusa arundinacea) trees. Some of the wild animals of the district are the nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus), antelok (Anelok cervicapra), pig (Sus scrofa), wolf (Canis lupus), jackal (Conis aureus), fox (Vulpes bengalensis), hare (Lepus ruficandatus), monkey (Macaca mulatta), wild cat (Felis bengalensis) and the porcupine (Hystric leucura). Several species of game birds are also seen, including the peafowl (Pavo cristatus), the black partridge (Frencolinus francolinus) and the gray partridge (Francalinus pondicervanus). A number of migratory water fowls visit the water bodies of the district in winter, such as the goose (Anser anser), <b>common</b> <b>teal</b> (Anas crecca), red-crested pochard (Netta rufina), white-eyed pochard (Aythya rufa) and the wigeon (Mareca penelope). The cobra (Naja naja), krait (Bungarus caeruleus), and rat-snake (Ptyas mucosus) are commonly found. The Indian crocodile or naka (Crocodylus palustris), and the ghariyal (Gavialis gangeticus) are {{also found in the}} river Ghaghra. The common fish species are rohu (Lebeo rohita), bhakur (Catla catla), nain (Cirrhina mrigala), parhin (Wallagonia attu), krunch (Labeo calbasu), and tengan (Mystus seenghala).|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of their wetland nature, the Moors and Levels contain a rich {{biodiversity}} of national and international importance. They support a vast variety of plant species, including common plants such as marsh marigold, meadowsweet, and ragged robin. The area is an important feeding ground for birds including Bewick’s swan, Eurasian curlew, common redshank, skylark, common snipe, <b>common</b> <b>teal,</b> wigeon, and whimbrel, as well as birds of prey including the marsh harrier and peregrine falcon. [...] A wide range of insect species is also present, including rare invertebrates, particularly beetles including the lesser silver water beetle, Bagous nodulosus, Hydrophilus piceus, Odontomyia angulata, Oulema erichsoni, and Valvata macrostoma. In addition, the area supports an important otter population. Water voles (Arvicola amphibius) are being encouraged to recolonise areas of the Levels where they have been absent for 10years, by the capture of mink (Mustela vison).|$|E
500|$|Today, {{the area}} is still home to a diverse {{population}} of birds and mammals, {{and some of the}} breeding species found do not breed anywhere else in Jordan. Among the bird species found are the European roller, desert lark, Dead Sea sparrow, desert finch and blue-cheeked bee-eater. The King Talal dam has created a lake which is a habitat for migratory waterfowl and various fish species. Notable birds found in the lake area include the little bittern, cattle egrets, [...] grey herons, white storks, <b>common</b> <b>teal</b> and Eurasian coot. The lake's waters sustain fish, some of which are indigenous species and some are introduced species. The most common are tilapia. [...] Migratory birds also winter in the man-made pools which make up the Kherbit Al-Samra Sewage Treatment Plant, located in a broad depression close to Wadi Dhulayl, the main tributary of the Zarqa River. As many as 6,000 white storks have been spotted roosting there. Mammals found in the area include the common otter (Lutra lutra), and the Persian squirrel (Sciurus anomalus). The otter is considered a threatened species.|$|E

Such a role would require wild birds to excrete virus {{in the absence of}} debilitating disease. By experimentally infecting wild ducks, we found that tufted ducks, Eurasian pochards, and mallards excreted signifi-cantly more virus than <b>common</b> <b>teals,</b> Eurasian wigeons, and gadwalls; yet only tufted ducks and, to a lesser degree, pochards became ill or died. These fi ndings suggest that some wild duck species, particularly mallards, can potentially be long-distance vectors of highly pathogenic avian infl uenza virus (H 5 N 1) and that others, particularly tufted ducks, are more likely to act as sentinels...|$|R

500|$|... "An austringer [...] {{undertaking}} {{to train}} a sparrowhawk {{should be in}} doubt that he is taking {{on one of the}} most difficult hawks available." [...] A female Eurasian sparrowhawk is considered a bad choice for a novice and the male is very difficult and demanding, even for an experienced handler. They have been described as [...] "hysterical little hawks" [...] but are also praised as courageous and providing [...] "sport of the highest quality." [...] Philip Glasier describes Eurasian sparrowhawks as [...] "in many ways superior to hunting with a larger short-wing [...] " [...] and [...] "extremely hard to tame." [...] They are best suited for small quarry such as common starlings and common blackbirds but are also capable of taking <b>common</b> <b>teal,</b> Eurasian magpies, pheasants and partridges. A 19th century author remarked that this species was [...] "the best of all hawks for landrails", now known as corn crakes. In 1735, the Sportsman's Dictionary noted that [...] "... she will serve in the winter as well as in the summer, and will fly at all kind of game more than the falcon. If a winter sparrowhawk prove good, she will kill the pye, the chough, the jay, woodcock, thrush, black-bird, fieldfare, and divers other birds of the like nature." ...|$|E
500|$|The Point juts {{into the}} sea on a north-facing coast, which means that migrant birds {{may be found in}} spring and autumn, {{sometimes}} in huge numbers when the weather conditions force them towards land. Numbers are relatively low in spring, but autumn can produce large [...] "falls", such as the hundreds of European robins on 1 October 1951 or more than 400 common redstarts, on 18 September 1995. The common birds are regularly accompanied by scarcer species like greenish warblers, great grey shrikes or Richard's pipits. Seabirds may be sighted passing the Point, and migrating waders feed on the marshes at this time of year. Vagrant rarities have turned up when the weather is appropriate, including a Fea's or Zino's petrel in 1997, a trumpeter finch in 2008, and an alder flycatcher in 2010. Ornithologist and pioneering bird photographer Emma Turner started ringing common terns on the Point in 1909, and the use of this technique for migration studies has continued since. A notable recovery was a Sandwich tern killed for food in Angola, and a Radde's warbler trapped for ringing in 1961 was only the second British record of this species at that time. In the winter, the marshes hold golden plovers and wildfowl including common shelduck, Eurasian wigeon, brent geese and <b>common</b> <b>teal,</b> while common scoters, common eiders, common goldeneyes and red-breasted mergansers swim offshore.|$|E
500|$|The Parrett then {{flows through}} the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve, which {{contains}} a rich biodiversity of national and international importance. It supports a vast variety of plant species, including common plants such as marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) and ragged robin (Lychnis flos-cuculi). The area is an important feeding ground for birds including Bewick’s swan (Cygnus columbianus bewickii), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), common redshank (Tringa totanus), skylark (Alauda arvensis), common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), <b>common</b> <b>teal</b> (Anas crecca), Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope) and whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), as well as birds of prey including the western marsh harrier (Circus aeruginosus) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). A wide range of invertebrate species is also present including rare insects, particularly the hairy click beetle (Synaptus filiformis), which until recently was only known in Britain from the Parrett, and other insects, including the lesser silver water beetle (Hydrochara caraboides), Bagous nodulosus, Hydrophilus piceus, Odontomyia angulata, Oulema erichsoni and Valvata macrostoma. In addition, the area supports an important European otter (Lutra lutra) population. 282 American mink (Mustela vison) have been captured after their escape from breeding farms, which is encouraging water voles (Arvicola amphibius) to recolonise areas of the Levels {{where they have been}} absent for 10years. The Levels and Moors include 32 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (twelve of them also Special Protection Areas), the Huntspill River and Bridgwater Bay National Nature Reserves, the Somerset Levels and Moors Ramsar Site covering about , the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve, Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve, and numerous Scheduled Ancient Monuments. In addition, some [...] of the Levels are recognised as an environmentally sensitive area, while other portions are designated as Areas of High Archaeological Potential. Despite this, there is currently no single conservation designation covering the entire area of the Levels and Moors.|$|E
40|$|Pairing of {{northern}} hemisphere dabbling ducks normally occurs in wintering sites. Mate choice occurs when some individuals congregate in courtship parties, in which females mainly choose mates according to male behavioural dominance. The sex ratio of some species is more male-biased at northern than at southern wintering sites, {{and the age}} ratio is adult-biased in northern areas. A possible mechanism responsible for this spatial segregation of sex and age classes is behavioural dominance, with males usually dominating females and adults dominating yearlings. Due to this latitudinal segregation of sexes during winter, presumably more males would remain unpaired in northern sites utilized by the more dominant birds than in southern sites utilized by the less-dominant birds, and this is paradoxical. I argue that some females having wintered and paired in southern sites may switch mates at stopover sites during northward migration. This hypothesis provides an explanation as to why, in spite of females being paired when initiating northward migration, some species show an increase in courtship activity during spring at stopover sites, as in <b>common</b> <b>teals</b> (Anas crecca) in southern Spain. In contrast, populations that do not migrate, e. g. mallards (A. platyrhynchos) in southern Spain, do not exhibit an increase in courtship activity during spring. © Japan Ethological Society and Springer-Verlag 2005.
