30|$|The Pt-ring counter {{electrode}} (6.0351. 100, Metrohm) and Ag/AgCl reference electrode (6.0750. 100, Metrohm) were commercially available {{and used for}} all the measurements. In order to fabricate the working electrode, each sample containing a catalyst layer was bonded to a wire with silver paint and electrically isolated by using a <b>custom-made</b> <b>package</b> consisting of pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA), leaving only an exposed gold area of 4  mm[*]×[*] 4  mm, as shown in Fig.  1 b. The measurements were performed with a potential sweep ranging from 0.10 to 0.45  V at a scan rate of 0.05  V s− 1, and the electrochemical setup {{used to measure the}} cyclic voltammograms is shown in Fig.  1 c. The three electrodes were immersed in the sample solution comprising a mixture of 20  mM ferro- and ferricyanide, [Fe(CN) 6] 3 − and [Fe(CN) 6] 4 −, and an electrolytic solution of 0.5  M KNO 3 in deionized water.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} a novel high-precision, low-noise, high-stability, calibrated and compensated digital oscillatory gyroscope with SPI interface, housed in <b>custom-made</b> ceramic <b>packages.</b> The device is factory-calibrated and compensated for temperature effects to provide high-accuracy digital output over a broad temperature range. Optimized tuning of the excitation and detection frequencies, {{as well as}} optimized mechanical and electrical balancing result in low sensitivity to shock and vibra-tions. By utilizing a unique sealed cavity technology, the vibrating elements of the gyroscope are contained within the low-pressure hermetic environment needed for high Q factors. Further on, improved stability of the device is achieved by full design sym-metry, high thermal efficiency and choice of crystalline materials in the entire structure...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} development of MEMS sensors for measuring sub-kPa (< 1000 Pa) wall shear stresses in high-speed turbulent flows. Wall shear stress is an important flow quantity {{that is used to}} characterize flows that can be found in aerospace, automotive, and biomedical applications. Sensors that can measure this quantity could have many uses ranging from pure turbulence research to flow control of vehicles. MEMS fabrication techniques allow for the creation of micro-scale sensors that are small enough to accurately measure fluctuating turbulent shear stress. Utilizing a direct-shear stress measurement with a floating element allows the sensors to be calibrated in a well-known shear flow before being installed in an unknown flow environment. The sensors use a differential capacitance measurement scheme combined with non-intrusive backside sensor connections, allowing measurements in recirculating and separating flows. As part of the sensor design process, 36 different sensor designs were created with varying feature sizes and performance ranges. This was done to mitigate the risks inherent in MEMS fabrication processes and to increase the chances of developing working sensors which could operate in the desired shear stress range (1 - 1000 Pa). The sensors were fabricated with the floating element in the top layer of an SOI wafer, with thru-wafer electrical interconnects (vias) created to connect the frontside of the sensor to the backside of the chip. Post-fabrication, the sensors were characterized electrically and mechanically under a microscope probe station. Sensors were then installed in a <b>custom-made</b> <b>package</b> which integrated off-the-shelf capacitance measuring circuitry with the MEMS sensor. Using a subsonic duct flow setup, sensors were calibrated in compressible turbulent air flow up to a mean shear stress of 335 Pa and a friction velocity Re value of 200, 000. After numerical temperature compensation was implemented (required due to temperature-dependent material properties) the sensor gain was calculated as 0. 16 mV/Pa. The mean shear stress calibration was then used to analyze the turbulence fluctuations inherent in the sensor signal. Turbulence measurements (including intensity, spectral density, and probability density function) indicated that the sensors were responding to shear stress fluctuations, but not detecting the entire turbulent energy spectrum due to low-pass filtering caused by the electrical circuitry. Experimental measurement of wall shear stress in compressible turbulent flows is an area that has not been fully explored due to previous limitations in available measurement technology. Once a better understanding is gained of the operation and limitations of the MEMS wall shear stress sensors, there lies a great potential to increase our understanding of turbulent flows with unprecedented measurements...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} about {{designing}} and implementing PowerPoint-based interactive simulations {{for use in}} International Relations (IR) introductory undergraduate classes based on core pedagogical literature, models of human skill acquisition, and previous research on simulations in IR teaching. We argue that simulations can be usefully employed at the early transition from “novice” to “advanced beginner” in a learning process, where the student begins to leave behind rational rules {{in favor of an}} own situational experience. However, currently available IR simulations for teaching purposes are often high-cost/high-tech and especially time-intensive: if they do not require <b>custom-made</b> software <b>packages</b> with difficult interfaces and expensive licensing fees, they are often targeted at course-long or at least day-long activities that demand extensive preparation of both teachers and students, with book-length manuals, intricate rules, integrated assessment tools, and specific secondary literature, and conventionally target more experienced students. This article explains how teachers can create an easily accessible and class-long (50 minutes) interactive experience for undergraduate IR students to encourage theoretical linkage with own in-class experience at a very low cost. We do this by employing PowerPoint, specifically in-built features such as hyperlinks, interactive pathways, or audio or video integration that can be used interactively rather than passively (as in a standard presentatio...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the reproducibility {{and validity of}} video screen measurement (VSM) of sagittal plane joint angles during gait. METHODS: 17 children with spastic cerebral palsy walked on a 10 m walkway. Videos were recorded and 3 d-instrumented gait analysis was performed. Two investigators measured six sagittal joint/segment angles (shank, ankle, knee, hip, pelvis, and trunk) using a <b>custom-made</b> software <b>package.</b> The intra- and interrater reproducibility were expressed by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of measurements (SEM) and smallest detectable difference (SDD). The agreement between VSM and 3 d joint angles was illustrated by Bland-Altman plots and limits of agreement (LoA). RESULTS: Regarding the intrarater reproducibility of VSM, the ICC ranged from 0. 99 (shank) to 0. 58 (trunk), the SEM from 0. 81 degrees (shank) to 5. 97 degrees (trunk) and the SDD from 1. 80 degrees (shank) to 16. 55 degrees (trunk). Regarding the interrater reproducibility, the ICC ranged from 0. 99 (shank) to 0. 48 (trunk), the SEM from 0. 70 degrees (shank) to 6. 78 degrees (trunk) and the SDD from 1. 95 degrees (shank) to 18. 8 degrees (trunk). The LoA between VSM and 3 d data ranged from 0. 4 +/- 13. 4 degrees (knee extension stance) to 12. 0 +/- 14. 6 degrees (ankle dorsiflexion swing). CONCLUSION: When performed by the same observer, VSM mostly allows the detection of relevant changes after an intervention. However, VSM angles differ from 3 d-IGA and {{do not reflect the}} real sagittal joint position, probably due to the additional movements in the other plane...|$|R
40|$|Myocardial strain imaging with 2 -D {{echocardiography}} is {{a relatively}} new noninvasive method to assess myocardial deformation. To determine the interobserver, intraobserver and intrapatient reliability scores, we evaluated myocardial strain measurements of 10 asymptomatic survivors of childhood cancer. Ten patients were selected randomly out of a follow-up cohort of childhood cancer survivors. All 10 patients underwent a transthoracic echocardiographic examination. Two-dimensional gray scale images were made in parasternal apical four-chamber, apical two-chamber, midcavity short-axis and basal short-axis views. Offline analysis was performed using software for echocardiographic quantification (Echopac 6. 1. 0, GE Medical Systems, Horten, Norway). All echocardiographic studies were analyzed offline by three observers, separately (A. M., G. W., M. P.). A <b>custom-made</b> software <b>package</b> was designed for averaging the strain curves of three consecutive cardiac cycles. Values of peak systolic strain, time-to-peak strain and time-to-end systole of the different segments of the left ventricle were used for statistical analysis. Interobserver, intraobserver and intrapatient reliability were expressed as intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Interobserver ICCs of peak strain, time to peak strain and time to aortic valve closure (AVC) were generally good to very good in all views and segments, except for in the two-chamber view. Intraobserver ICCs were rated as very good for almost all segments, except for the longitudinal peak strain values of the two-chamber view. Intrapatient ICCs were generally good for the two-chamber, four-chamber and midcavity short-axis views, but fair to moderate for the segments of the basal short-axis view (SaxMV). We recommend use of the four-chamber view for longitudinal peak strain values, and the basal and midcavity short-axis views for radial and circumferential peak strain values. Furthermore, we strongly recommend using the average of three cardiac cycles for peak strain values in clinical studies...|$|R
