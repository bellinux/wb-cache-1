40|$|This paper {{uses the}} {{sustainable}} livelihoods framework {{to explore the}} contribution of smallholder production to food security in some sub-Saharan African countries and relates it to the South African case. Noting {{that many of the}} world’s hungry are smallholder farmers, it is clear that food insecurity is closely linked to the livelihood strategies of these farm households. As previous studies have shown, food insecurity is linked to livelihood assets, strong institutional support and a favourable external environment. In particular, the paper finds that food security depends on <b>cereal</b> <b>output,</b> budgetary support to agriculture, agricultural value added and poverty – all variables strongly linked to the sustainable livelihoods framework. Since most poor rural households rely on agricultural production for a significant share of their household income, increasing agricultural productivity is critical to increase food security and reduce rural poverty. food security, livelihoods, smallholder agriculture, sub-Saharan Africa, Consumer/Household Economics,...|$|E

40|$|This project {{examined}} the Bimoba design of mud silo being extended by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture throughout the Northern Region of Ghana. The basic type of store {{was found to}} be a cheap, environmentally sustainable store for <b>cereals</b> (<b>Output</b> 1). Of the three aspects examined when determining the store’s suitability for storage purposes (technical effectiveness, affordability, and sustainability), the following key points were identified: • Farmers expectations for the mud silo include issues such as flexibility, prevalence of building materials, durability, maintenance, secrecy, and effectiveness of chemicals, as well as storage performance. Of the 15 factors raised by farmers when deciding on the type of store to use, protection against insects, number of crops that could be stored, and protection against termites were rated as being the most important. • Traditional timber-based structures were found to exhibit more rapid and greater changes in temperature and moisture content during storage, and to have lower overall temperatures and moisture contents than mud silos. Mud silos can be very effective stores although severe levels of moulding can occur (probably more than in some othe...|$|R
30|$|To {{check the}} {{robustness}} {{and validity of}} our empirical findings, we also estimated Eq. (1) using an instrumental variable approach. In this case, we only utilized the dummy variable measuring smallholder farmers’ contact {{with at least one}} agricultural extension officer as an instrumental variable for crop diversification (results shown in Table  4). Even though we come to the same conclusions regarding the impact of crop diversification on farm productivity, income, and food security, we interpret these results with caution as we suspect that the problem of weak instruments may arise as indicated by relatively small first stage F-statistics especially for productivity as measured by <b>cereal</b> <b>output.</b> Staiger and Stock (1997) argue that the problem of weak instruments may cause serious bias on the results if the F-test for joint significance does not exceed 10 (see Table  4). We thus focus much on the results of the joint estimation approach. We conduct all our analysis using Stata version 13.|$|E
40|$|Time series data {{reveals that}} the Sahel of Cameroon has {{experienced}} several years of deficits in cereal production. The debate attributes the observed trends to low rainfall. Uncertainties in {{the debate on the}} role of rainfall as a principal causal factor are evident and need verification. Both field and desk studies have been used; this involved the administration of 200 questionnaires and focused group discussions. The desk studies included detailed literature review and analysis of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) satellite images of vegetation and rainfall from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP). The results show that cereal production has declined while rainfall has increased by 30 - 40 % in the last decade in the study area. With an increase in rainfall, the observed decline in cereal production cannot be explained by climate only.

40|$|Making {{a killing}} from hunger We need to {{overturn}} food policy, now! For {{some time now}} {{the rising cost of}} food all over the world has taken households, governments and the media by storm. The price of wheat has gone up by 130 % over the last year. 1 Rice has doubled in price in Asia {{in the first three months}} of 2008 alone, 2 and just last week it hit record highs on the Chicago futures market. 3 For most of 2007 the spiralling cost of cooking oil, fruit and vegetables, as well as of dairy and meat, led to a fall in the consumption of these items. From Haiti to Cameroon to Bangladesh, people have been taking to the streets in anger at being unable to afford the food they need. In fear of political turmoil, world leaders have been calling for more food aid, as well as for more funds and technology to boost agricultural production. Cereal exporting countries, meanwhile, are closing their borders to protect their domestic markets, while other countries have been forced into panic buying. Is this a price blip? No. A food shortage? Not that either. We are in a structural meltdown, the direct result of three decades of neoliberal globalisation.

40|$|In {{the last}} three decades {{the world as a whole}} made {{significant}} progress in the food and nutrition area. The world average per caput food availabilities for direct human consumption grew 19 % between 1961 / 63 and 1993 / 95 to 2710 calories/day, while those of the developing countries grew 32 % to 2550 calories (Figure 1). This happened while world population grew from 3. 0 billion in 1960 to 5. 7 billion in 1995. In parallel, the part of world population living in countries where per caput food supplies are very low (under 2200 calories) decreased considerably from 56 % of world population in 1969 / 71 to only 10 % in 92 / 94 (Figure 2). In the developing countries, part of the improvement depended on rising net food imports, particularly during the 1970 s (Figure 10). However, progress has been very uneven and bypassed a large number of countries and population groups. There are currently still over 800 million persons undernourished, with high concentrations in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 3). In recent years, there has been a slowdown in the growth of world agricultural production. World <b>cereals</b> <b>output</b> stagnated and fluctuated widely in the first half of the 1990 s. In per caput terms, it is now lower than in the mid- 1980 s (Figure 4).

500|$|Agricultural {{output in}} 1980 was 21% {{higher than the}} average {{production}} rate between 1966 and 1970. <b>Cereal</b> crop <b>output</b> increased by 18%. These improved results were not encouraging. In the Soviet Union the criterion for assessing agricultural output was the grain harvest. The import of cereal, which began under Khrushchev, had in fact become a normal phenomenon by Soviet standards. When Brezhnev had difficulties sealing commercial trade agreements with the United States, he went elsewhere, such as to Argentina. Trade was necessary because the Soviet Union's domestic production of fodder crops was severely deficient. Another sector that was hitting the wall was the sugar beet harvest, which had declined by 2% in the 1970s. Brezhnev's way of resolving these issues was to increase state investment. Politburo member Gennady Voronov advocated for the division of each farm's work-force into what he called [...] "links". These [...] "links" [...] would be entrusted with specific functions, such as to run a farm's dairy unit. His argument was that the larger the work force, the less responsible they felt. This program had been proposed to Joseph Stalin by Andrey Andreyev in the 1940s, and had been opposed by Khrushchev before and after Stalin's death. Voronov was also unsuccessful; Brezhnev turned him down, and in 1973 he was removed from the Politburo.|$|R
40|$|Self-sufficiency and markets: Chayanov, Labrousse, or Le Roy Ladurie? Instead of {{the classic}} {{opposition}} between self-sufficiency and the market—the starting point and the end point of change in rural society—the study of French agrarian life in the modern period points to a distinction closer to that between target produ­cers and market producers. The national dividing line of autarky effectively divided the peasantry into two camps. Above the line, a handful of larger or more specialized farming units sold their produce and regularly generated negotiable surpluses; however, faced with competition {{in the form of}} ecclesiastical and seigneurial levies, they hesitated to increase their <b>cereal</b> <b>output.</b> Below the line, the majority of peasants owned too little land to provide for their families' needs even in a normal year, and were obliged to seek out the necessary supplements—but only those supplements—in various markets (the grain, labor, credit and land markets). The violent fluctuations of these secondary markets reflected variations in supply and demand that affected only a minor share of output. This dual incentive for production units to adopt a Malthusian strategy is an even more powerful explanation than technological stagnation for the inertia of farming output, which, {{in the latter half of}} the eighteenth century, was not so much guided by price trends as durably indexed on the population.

40|$|In {{the first}} two decades after its release, methane, a green house gas, is 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Historically, {{atmospheric}} concentrations of methane remained fairly stable at around 750 ppb, significantly less than today’s levels of 1, 800 ppb. Unfortunately, agricultural activity accounts for about one-fifth of total global greenhouse gas emissions, while the current production of ruminants contributes nearly 80 % of these emissions due to their large populations, body size and appetites, and the anaerobic microbial fermentation that occurs during digestion. Because of methane’s severe impact on the climate, methane emissions, specifically due {{to the production of}} ruminants, needs to be reduced on a national, and international, scale. While it would be unrealistic to expect the population to completely exclude meats from their diets because of the environmental effects, there are some meats that have far lesser environmental consequences. The farming of cattle causes approximately 120 kg of methane to be released into the atmosphere each year, an extreme number compared to the only 0. 26 kg of methane released by poultry per year. Replacing ruminant consumption with meats such as poultry, vegetarian fish, and mono-gastric mammals would severely reduce the green house gas emissions related to food production. The global population is expected to grow by 40 % by 2050, with the global middle class, who are most able and likely to consume meats, doubling by 2030. Just to stabilize the emission of greenhouse gas emissions from the meat industry, global meat consumption would be required to fall to 90 grams per capita daily, versus the current 173 grams per capita globally. These numbers are frightening to the average American, who consumes an average of 381 grams daily. The combination of the exponentially higher number of people needing to be fed, with the extent that the rise in meat demand will have on greenhouse gas emissions requires a decrease in the amount of meat consumed. Livestock consume over a third of world <b>cereal</b> <b>output.</b> In addition, the transfer of energy from plant to animal is very inefficient. The efficiency from the cereal to be eaten by the livestock to our dinner plates would be greatly increased by the direct consumption of cereals, for example, and therefore a greater number {{of people around the world}} would be able to be fed. That being said, as the population of those with disposable incomes continues to rise, it would be unfair to expect that their consumption of meat protein should remain static in order to reduce total environmental impact, while first world countries continue to consume significantly higher levels of meat. Therefore, we must take this expected increase in consumption into account when considering our share of global meat reduction. Many governments, including the US, are hesitant and resist international agendas and agreements that reduce the beef market, and methods to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in general, due to the effect it would have on the economy. The US in particular has been persistent in supporting the promotion of the beef industry through policies such as the Beef Research and Promotion Act of 1985, because of it’s impact on our economy. Fortunately, we can reduce our methane emissions without destroying our economy. Reducing methane emissions from enteric fermentation not only helps control pollution, but increases the efficiency in which the ruminants consume their food. Methane emissions alone account for 2 %- 12 % of gross energy loss of feeds during consumption. Through altering the livestock’s nutrition such as increasing the amount of grains, including leguminous forages, supplementation of low-quality feed with protein and readily fermentable carbohydrates, and adding fats to feed not only reduces methane emissions, but improves the efficiency in which the food is utilized, therefore increasing livestock feed efficiency. In May of 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency enacted the first national policy to directly control methane emissions for oil and gas operations, but as Environmental campaigner Jonathon Porritt stated, “Policy makers’ attention to [...] . meat eating is as close to zero as it is possible to get. ” Policies controlling methane emissions throughout the meat production process, and sustainability motivators such as carbon credits, would bring us a leap forward. First, the government will need to redirect current policies that encourage beef consumption into utilization of funds towards research on reducing methane emissions from enteric fermentation. They should also reduce subsidies, direct or indirect, for animal feed, such as the production of corn, so that the natural increase in retail prices will reduce meat consumption, and redirect grain production to expanding number of humans who need to be fed around the world. In addition, this will leave room for policies encouraging sustainable food consumption and educating consumers regarding the environmental and health benefits of a reduced meat diet...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simulation model to project land-cover changes {{at a national}} scale for Sudano-sahelian countries. The {{aim of this study}} is to better understand the driving forces of land-use change and to reconstruct past changes. The structure of our model is heavily determined by its spatially aggregated level. This model represents, in a dynamic way, a simplified version of our current understanding of the processes of land-use change in the Sudano-sahelian region of Africa. For any given year, the land demand is calculated under the assumption that there should be an equilibrium between the production and consumption of basic resources derived from different land-uses. The exogenous variables of the model are human population (rural and urban), livestock, rainfall and <b>cereals</b> imports. The <b>output</b> are the areas allocated to fuelwood extraction, crops, fallow and pasture for every year. Pressure indicators are also generated endogenously by the model (rate of overgrazing and land degradation, labour productivity, average household "budget"). The parameters of the model were derived on the basis of a comprehensive review of the literature, mostly of local scale case studies of land-use changes in the Sahel. In agreement with farming system research, the model simulates two processes of land-use change: agricultural expansion at the most extensive technological level, followed by agricultural intensification once some land threshold is reached. The model was first tested at a national scale using data from Burkina Faso. Results simulate land-use changes at two time frequencies: high frequency, as driven by climatic variability, and low frequency, as driven by demographic trends. The rates of cropland expansion predicted by the model are consistent with rates measured for several case studies, based on fine spatial resolution remote sensing data. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|The European Commission {{released}} two internal- {{and four}} external-impact studies on January 15 th 2003 which review the likely {{impact of the}} Commission's mid-term review proposals on agriculture in the EU- 15 and EU- 25. In its accompanying press statement the Commission emphasised that the proposed 'de-coupling' of aid from production would not lead to any abandonment of production but would considerably improve market balances in the EU. The main impact of de-coupling {{it was pointed out}} would be felt in the beef sector while the impact in the arable sector would be marginal. The Commission argued that its modulation proposals would {{have a positive impact on}} overall farm income. On January 16 th Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler elaborated on the major findings of the studies, maintaining that the studies showed that de-coupled direct aid payments would not be the end of farming in the EU and would not lead to 'the Europe-wide food shortages predicted by some doom mongers'. He pointed out that in the <b>cereals</b> sector <b>output</b> levels would scarcely be affected, and that although output in the beef sector would drop by 3 %, this would be accompanied by a shift to less intensive and more high-quality production which would actually increase farmers' incomes in the beef sector by 4 %. Commissioner Fischler insisted that 2003 is a year of decision for the CAP, with EU Ministers being called upon to make decisions by the middle of 2003. The tabling of specific proposals for regulations was scheduled for the week of the 20 th January. Comment: It should be noted that the impact assessment of the Commission's mid-term review only looks at the impact of changes where the Commission is planning to make specific proposals. The assessments do not and cannot look at the implications of possible reforms of the dairy, sugar, olive oil, and certain fruit and vegetable regimes which the Commission may propose between now and 2009. It is an open question therefore as to what the implications would be of a move over to a system involving single de-coupled farm payments if the dairy, sugar olive oil and fruit and vegetable sectors were to be brought into the scheme (as seems to be the Commission's long-term intention under the mid-term review proposals). It should also be borne in mind that by the time the Commission's proposals have passed through the EU Council of Ministers, member states will have secured specific concessions in areas of greatest concern to them, which in all probability will provide additional incentives for production which will not have been taken into account in the recently conducted modelling exercises. The European Commission released two internal- and four external-impact studies [...] ...|$|R
