40|$|Bresnan (1978 : 8 - 9, 1982 : 29, 2001 : 31) {{proposes that}} English has a general {{morphological}} process of participle-adjective conversion which enables any verbal participle {{to be used}} as an adjective. The phenomenon captured by the Participle-Adjective <b>Conversion</b> <b>Rule</b> has been used as key evidence from English that passivisation is a lexical relation change, not a syntactic transformation, and as such, it can feed lexical processes of derivational morphology. The discussion offered in this paper supports fully the lexical character of both passivisation and participial formation. However, it argues for a small but important revision to the formulation of the <b>Conversion</b> <b>Rule.</b> Specifically, the morphological derivation of participles does not engage the syntactic level of argument structure. The input to the <b>Conversion</b> <b>Rule</b> is a verb, and the output is a deverbal form (a participle) which is category-neutral between a verb and an adjective (i. e. it is both a verb and an adjective at the same time). Passivisation is also a derivation, but it is morphosyntactic: it occurs at the level of argument structure of the predicate and it is an operation on grammatical functions. A patient-oriented (derived) participle is passive only if it is used as the main verb of the passive construction. ...|$|R

What are the implications on these rules of allowing for a feedback between conversion decisions and the stochasticity of conservation benefits?

We solve this model using a real-options approach, which leads to the conventional <b>conversion</b> <b>rule</b> as a special case. Calibrating the model to a specific case (Costa Rica), we demonstrate the presence of an augmented quasi-option value. The size of this value depends on the strength of the feedback.
