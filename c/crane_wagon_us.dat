This {{prefabricated}} T-shaped track was {{carried on the}} gun train and deployed by a special <b>crane</b> <b>wagon.</b> Once the front bogies were at the crossover {{at the top of}} the T they were then jacked up and turned with the subframe 90° and then lowered onto the crosstroke of the T. The gun was then traversed by an electric motor to the bogies and it was clamped to the track once laid onto the target. It fired HE shells weighing 107.5 kg.|$|R

25|$|The Biggest {{exhibit is}} a {{locomotive}} named Nellie, after Nellie Crane the vicar's wife. Nellie is an 0-4-0 saddle tank industrial locomotive 1435, {{one of two}} built by Hudswell Clarke in Leeds in 1922 for the Esholt sewage works. When the works were being built, she carried excavated material, and thereafter coal and construction material, then coal and other materials until 1970 when she was loaned to the Yorkshire Dales Railway Society at Skipton. Her size is ca.23 x 8 x 11ft, and she weighs 28 tons. The boiler works at 160psi, and she carries 700 gallons in the saddle water tank. The cylinders are 40-inch diameter 20-inch stroke operated by Stephenson's open link valve gear. A British Railways <b>Crane</b> <b>Wagon</b> is on display outside near the museum gates.|$|R

Finally, van 12 became a BB, BA, then HD wagon despite that code normally being reserved for four-wheeled wagons, and finally it became VZAA, a fire attack wagon.|$|R
5000|$|... === North America === A {{version of}} the KC Laser, the Mercury Tracer, was marketed in the US and Canada, {{available}} as a hatchback and wagon only. The Tracer hatchback shared its bodyshell with its Laser counterpart, but the wagon was a distinct design based on the Laser hatchback, rather than the sedan, {{as was the case}} with the Meteor <b>wagon.</b> <b>US</b> versions of the Tracer were built in Mexico, whereas for the Canadian market, Ford opted to import the Mercury Tracer from Taiwan instead. In Bermuda, however, the KE Laser was sold locally in right hand drive badged as a Ford.|$|R

40|$|We {{show how}} to {{determine}} if a given simple rectilinear polygon can be tiled with rectangles, each having an integer side. 1 Introduction In [6], Stan <b>Wagon</b> provides <b>us</b> with 14 proofs of the fact that if a rectangle R is tiled with rectangles, each having at least one side of integral length, then R has a side of integral length. Rather than simply add a fifteenth proof to his list, we would like to address the much more general problem of tileability of arbitrary rectilinear polygons. In particular we will give an algorithm for deciding when a rectilinear polygon (that is, a polygon with sides parallel to the axes) can be tiled with rectangles, each having an integer side. The proof idea comes from a neat method, due to John Conway in the case of polyominos, for dealing with tiling problems of this sort. That method is to define a group, the "tiling group" which depends on the set of tiles involved in the particular problem, and gives a necessary condition for the tileability of a [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Also {{located within}} the railway yard is the Westinghouse Brake Examination Pit and shelter. It {{comprises}} a modest corrugated iron building with a barrel vaulted corrugated iron roof covering a long rectangular brick-lined pit. The building contains boards detailing brake examination schedules, and a workbench.Other yard structures include Signal Cabin A, a water <b>crane</b> and a <b>wagon</b> weighbridge. Signal Cabin A is a two-storeyed chamferboard-clad building with pitched corrugated iron roofs, a cantilevered timber catwalk overlooking the railway at first floor level. The building contains intact but disconnected mechanical signalling equipment. The first floor contains a large frame of colour-coded mechanical steel signalling levers, timber and brass track indicators, and a yard diagram. The Water Crane comprises a cast iron hollow tube surmounted by a rotating cast iron feeder arm with valve controls and a canvas tube attached, mounted on a concrete pedestal and adjacent to a concrete drain. The Wagon Weighbridge comprises a large steel scale housed in chamferboard-clad building with a pitched corrugated iron roof, and a large metal balance plate.|$|R
25|$|The {{first major}} {{expansion}} in Henry and Clem's South Bend business came from their {{being in the}} right place {{to meet the needs of}} the California Gold Rush that began in 1849. From his wheelbarrow enterprise at Placerville, John M. had amassed $8,000. In April 1858, he quit and moved out to apply this to financing the vehicle manufacturing of H & C Studebaker, which was already booming because of a big order to build <b>wagons</b> for the <b>US</b> Army. In 1857, they had also built their first carriage—"Fancy, hand-worked iron trim, the kind of courting buggy any boy and girl would be proud to be seen in".|$|R

Most coal and aggregates are moved in hopper <b>wagons</b> or gondolas (<b>US)</b> or open <b>wagons</b> (UIC) that can be filled and discharged rapidly, to enable efficient handling of the materials.|$|R
5|$|The final part of {{the supply}} chain for {{domestic}} and smaller commercial customers involved the delivery of ice, typically using an ice <b>wagon.</b> In the <b>U.S.,</b> ice was cut into 25-, 50- and 100-pound blocks (11, 23 and 45kg) then distributed by horse-drawn ice wagons. An iceman, driving the cart, would then deliver the ice to the household, using ice tongs to hold the cubes. Deliveries could occur either daily or twice daily. By the 1870s, various specialist distributors existed in the major cities, with local fuel dealers or other businesses selling and delivering ice in the smaller communities. In Britain, ice was rarely sold to domestic customers via specialist dealers during the 19th century, instead usually being sold through fishmongers, butchers and chemists, who kept ice on their premises for their own commercial use.|$|R

60|$|Upon {{more than}} one point I was worried. Often and often I {{reflected}} that some hitch might occur to prevent my getting money promptly from Mr. Dix. Days would perchance elapse before I could find the man in such a great city as London; he might be out of town at this season, Easter being less than a se'nnight away. For I had heard my grandfather say that the elder Mr. Dix had a house in some merchant's suburb, and loved to play at being a squire before he died. Again (my heart stood at the thought), the Manners might be gone back to America. I cursed the stubborn pride which had led the captain to hire a post-chaise, when the <b>wagon</b> had served <b>us</b> so much better, and besides relieved him of the fusillade of ridicule he got travelling as a gentleman. But such reflections always ended in my upbraiding myself for blaming him whose generosity had rescued me from perhaps a life-long misery.|$|R
