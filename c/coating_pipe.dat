40|$|The {{presented}} report {{examines the}} origin of the uranium-concentration in pyrolitic carbon, which is deposited on spherical UO_ 2 -fuel kernels. Uranium-concentration-profiles were measured in the outer pyrolitic carbon layer (HDI) by successive mechanical removing and fluorimetrical uranium determination. According to the distribution of the uranium-concentration in the layer and according to annealing tests it was possible to exclude a contamination of the layer by Fick's diffusion of uranium through the coating of the oxide nuclear fuel. It was found that during the deposition uranium from the gas phase is stored up in the growing outer pyrolitic carbon layer. The uranium can evaporate into the coating area from the contaminated walls of the <b>coating</b> <b>pipe</b> and from fuel kernels, which are exposed during the deposition of the HDI-layer. With a model coating test at 2000 °C according to these results it was possible to drop the average uranium concentration in the HDI-layer to a value of 2 · 10 ^- 6 g U/g Pyc...|$|E

40|$|AbstractViscoelastic {{coatings}} {{are often}} used to protect pipelines in {{the oil and gas}} industry. However, over time defects and areas of corrosion often form in these pipelines and so it is desirable to monitor the structural integrity of these <b>coated</b> <b>pipes</b> using techniques similar to those used on uncoated pipelines. A common approach is to use ultrasonic guided waves that work on the pulse-echo principle; however, the energy in the guided waves can be heavily attenuated by the coating and so significantly reduce the effective range of these techniques. Accordingly, it is desirable to develop {{a better understanding of how}} these waves propagate in <b>coated</b> <b>pipes</b> with a view to optimising test methodologies, and so this article uses a hybrid SAFE-finite element approach to model scattering from non-axisymmetric defects in <b>coated</b> <b>pipes.</b> Predictions are generated in the time and frequency domain and it is shown that the longitudinal family of modes is likely to have a longer range in <b>coated</b> <b>pipes</b> when compared to torsional modes. Moreover, it is observed that the energy velocity of modes in a <b>coated</b> <b>pipe</b> is very similar to the group velocity of equivalent modes in uncoated pipes. It is also observed that the coating does not induce any additional mode conversion over and above that seen for an uncoated pipe when an incident wave is scattered by a defect. Accordingly, it is shown that when studying <b>coated</b> <b>pipes</b> one need account only for the attenuation imparted by the coating so that one may normally neglect the effect of coating on modal dispersion and scattering...|$|R

40|$|When a {{pipeline}} is installed at deep waters the primary design load is the external pressure, hence making the collapse pressure the major design parameter. Pipeline collapse formulas are functions of elastic and plastic collaspe pressure acompanied the initial ovality and yield stress. The most common formulas for collapse are the Timoshenko, Shell and Haagsma equation where {{the latter is}} the least conservative and used in the offshore standard DNV-OS-F 101. In any pipeline system onshore or offshore {{there is a need}} of pipeline protection. The purpose of coating is to isolate the pipeline steel from the seawater, the soil and to introduce a high resistance path between anodic and cathodic areas. Such coatings can be ranging from a few up to around hundred millimeter, thus the cros section of the <b>coated</b> <b>pipe</b> can be many times initial cros section of the bare steel pipe. Existing design formulas for collapse are neglecting the effect of pipeline coating and a study is proposed to investigate if todays practice of neglecting the coating is ac- ceptable. In this project ABAQUS finite element software has been used to examine a <b>coated</b> <b>pipe</b> section with various thicknesses, elasticity and ovality and compared the collapse limit to the values of a uncoated pipe. Based on the assumption of elasticity and material model of coating the results has shown to increase the collapse capacity when the coating thickness and elasticity increases. The values has shown a increase in range of 5 to 25 %. The ovality of the coating however has shown to not effect the pipe collapse capacity in any significant way. Also based on a proposed simple analytical collapse model of serial resistance where the collapse capacity of the steel pipe is added to the collapse capacity of the <b>coated</b> <b>pipe</b> without the steel, the model has shown a good agreement with ABAQUS collapse data and thus is recommended for use in collapse calculation of coated pipelines.

The pipes’ surfaces wereexamined with respect to scratches, {{and the depth of}} the most prominent ones were determined. Of the two laying techniques, pipe bursting was the one causing the deepest scratches. Horizontal drilling was not significantly worse than ordinary handling during transport and preparation with respect to scratch depth. Dragging of the pipe above ground on asphalt surfaces caused severe damage to the pipe wall. The deepest scratches were seen on two pipe alternatives with soft coatings. Due to thic kness, however, these coatings were not penetrated and thus successfully protected the main pipe wall. The hardest coating tested, a polypropylene alternative, were also thethinnest one, and was penetrated at one location during the pipe bursting test.

The GWT test range in buried, coated pipelines is greatly reduced compared to above ground configurations due to energy leakage into the embedding soil. In this paper, {{the effect of}} pipe coatings on the guided wave attenuation is investigated {{with the aim of}} increasing test ranges for buried pipelines. The attenuation of the T(0, 1) and L(0, 2) guided wave modes is measured using a full-scale experimental apparatus in a fusion-bonded epoxy (FBE) -coated 8 in. pipe, buried in loose and compacted sand. Tests are performed over a frequency range typically used in GWT of 10 – 35 kHz and compared with model predictions. It is shown that the application of a low impedance coating between the FBE layer and the sand effectively decouples the influence of the sand on the ultrasound leakage from the buried pipe. Ultrasonic isolation of a buried pipe is demonstrated by <b>coating</b> the <b>pipe</b> with a Polyethylene (PE) -foam layer that has a smaller impedance than both the pipe and sand, and has the ability to withstand the overburden load from the sand. The measured attenuation in the buried PE-foam-FBE-coated pipe is found to be substantially reduced, in the range of 0. 3 – 1. 2 dBm− 1 for loose and compacted sand conditions, compared to measured attenuation of 1. 7 – 4. 7 dBm− 1 in the buried FBE-coated pipe without the PE-foam. The acoustic properties of the PE-foam are measured independently using ultrasonic interferometry and incorporated into model predictions of guided wave propagation in buried <b>coated</b> <b>pipe.</b> Good agreement is found between the experimental measurements and model predictions. The attenuation exhibits periodic peaks in the frequency domain corresponding to the through-thickness resonance frequencies of the coating layer. The large reduction in guided wave attenuation for PE-coated pipes would lead to greatly increased GWT test ranges; such coatings would be attractive for new pipeline installations...|$|R
