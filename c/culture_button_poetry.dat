5000|$|Later in 2013, a {{video of}} Hilborn's poem [...] "OCD" [...] went viral, garnering {{millions}} of views across social media platforms. Although a performance of [...] "OCD" [...] {{was among the first}} videos posted on <b>Button</b> <b>Poetry's</b> YouTube page in 2012, the poem did not gain popularity until another performance was posted a year later. As of 2017 the video garnered more than 62 million views and is both <b>Button</b> <b>Poetry's</b> most watched video and the most watched slam poem on the internet. Because of the poem's success, in 2014 Hilborn signed with the College Agency, a company that represents performers in all genres who want to perform on college campuses across the country. Hilborn was then able to begin [...] "earnest" [...] touring, and began supporting himself with his poetry.|$|R

5000|$|David Cote in {{his review}} of the Broadway {{production}} for Time Out New York wrote, [...] "I love Hamilton. I love it like I love New York, or Broadway when it gets it right. And this is so right... A sublime conjunction of radio-ready hip-hop (as well as R&B, Britpop and trad showstoppers), under-dramatized American history and Miranda's uniquely personal focus as a first-generation Puerto Rican and inexhaustible wordsmith, Hamilton hits multilevel <b>culture</b> <b>buttons,</b> hard... The work's human drama and novelistic density remain astonishing." [...] He chose Hamilton as a Critics' Pick, and gave the production five out of five stars.|$|R

40|$|AIMS—To {{detect the}} {{presence}} of guttae by means of light microscopy during organ culture and to evaluate the influence of {{the presence of}} guttae in the donor tissue on transplantation outcome.  METHODS—Donor corneas were investigated for the presence of guttae by means of light microscopy at the end of organ <b>culture.</b> Recipient corneal <b>buttons</b> from patients with severe Fuchs' dystrophy and donor corneas with advanced guttae were first studied by light microscopy and subsequently by transmission electron microscopy. Lastly, 168  consecutive donor corneas were evaluated for the presence of guttae and issued for transplantation.  RESULTS—Corneal specimens with Fuchs' dystrophy displayed numerous round highly reflecting guttae {{at the level of the}} corneal endothelium. Donor corneas with advanced guttae showed less numerous guttae. Among 168  organ cultured donor corneas issued for transplantation, low density guttae were found in 43  (25. 6 %) corneas. The endothelial cell density and figure coefficient were significantly lower and organ culture time was significantly higher in the cornea guttata group than in the control group. The presence of grouped guttae significantly decreased the adjusted graft survival. The incidence of postoperative stage 3  cornea guttata was significantly higher when grouped guttae were found (5 / 6) than when no guttae or scattered guttae were found (8 / 101).  CONCLUSION—Cornea guttata can be detected during organ culture by means of light microscopy. It is associated with a decrease in endothelial cell figure coefficient and cell density. The presence of grouped guttae is associated with poorer graft survival and more frequent stage 3  cornea guttata in the graft after transplantation. ...|$|R
