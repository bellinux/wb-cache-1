The experimental results show that ZSM- 5 with crystal size of 200 nm exhibited the maximum aromatic yield and minimum BTX selectivity. The results could be attributed to its highest micropore surface area, amount of weak acid and maximum Bronsted to Lewis acid sites ratio (B/L ratio).

40|$|Abstract Coal-tar pitch, a {{feedstock}} {{which can}} be heat-treated to create graphite, is composed of very complex molecules. Coal-tar pitch is a precursor of many useful carbon materials (e. g., graphite, carbon fibers, electrodes and matrices of carbon/ carbon composites). Modified coal-tar pitch (MCTP) was prepared using two different heat-treatment methods and their properties were characterized and compared. One was prepared using heat treatment in nitrogen gas; the other was prepared under a pressure of 350 mmHg in air. The MCTPs were investigated to determine several properties, including softening point, C/H ratio, <b>coke</b> <b>yield,</b> formation of anisotropic mesophase and viscosity.

30|$|From {{their results}} in Table  7, {{they found that}} raising the {{hydrocarbon}} partial pressure increased the amount of dry gas and coke {{at the expense of}} gasoline. They attributed the higher <b>coke</b> <b>yield</b> to a higher rate of oligomerization, which is a bimolecular reaction and favored at high pressure. They also found that increasing the hydrocarbon partial pressure substantially lowered the C 3 and C 4 olefinicities leading to a decrease in the yield of propylene and butylene. These yield shifts suggest that the rate of hydrogen transfer increases with hydrocarbon partial pressure, as would be expected for a bimolecular reaction [26, 49].|$|E
30|$|In the {{conventional}} RFCC reactor, the overlong reaction time, the fast deactivation of catalyst, and the competitive adsorption and reaction between fresh feedstock and cycle oil {{would lead to}} the overcracking of light oil and the deterioration of the product distribution.

Increasing the yield of the valuable light olefins, especially propylene and butenes, is a profitable opportunity for integrated refineries. As global petrochemical demand for propylene continues to grow, opportunities for improved production routes will emerge.

30|$|When catechol-type {{aromatic}} rings decompose into gas {{and other}} products at high temperatures (> 550 [*]°C), catechols/pyrogallols and cresols/xylenols tend to produce coke (second stage coking) [96].

30|$|The gas {{formation}} reactivities of cresols/xylenols {{are lower}} than those of catechols/pyrogallols and the compositions of the gaseous products are very different for these two types of products [96]. Cresols/xylenols tend to produce CH 4 and H 2 rather than CO and CO 2, along with demethylation products and coke at 600 [*]°C in an ampoule. Methane is formed by H-donation to methyl radicals formed during demethylation and the coking process produces H-radicals during polyaromatization, which leads to the formation of H 2. The CH 4 yield is related to the number of methyl groups in cresols/xylenols, and the yield increases in the order, o-cresol (2.8  wt%)[*]< 2, 4 -xylenol (5.9  wt%) and 2, 6 -xylenol (6.0  wt%)[*]< 1, 3, 5 -trimethylphenol (9.5  wt%).

Two additional blends of ECTP and EXT were prepared at the 30 and 50 wt% EXT content using a procedure already described. The characteristics of the blends are presented. The density for these blended materials is not much different than the density for the blends reported earlier. The softening point temperature for the 30 wt% EXT increased to over 200 C while the softening point temperature for the 50 wt% EXT blend was too high to be determined by the Mettler method. <b>Coke</b> <b>yields</b> approximately follow the law of mixtures. The optical texture of the green cokes for the 30 and 50 wt% EXT blends is shown.

The co-processing of coal with petroleum residues or other heavy hydrocarbons at elevated temperature and pressure has received considerable attention in the research community as a means to upgrade simultaneously coal and byproducts. Heavy hydrocarbons can function as sources of hydrogen, as well as performing as a medium for dissolution and dispersion of coal fragments. However, the focus of much of the prior research has been on developing fuels, distillable liquids, or synthetic crudes.

40|$|One of the {{possible}} process options {{for the production of}} advanced biofuels is the co-processing of upgraded pyrolysis oil in standard refineries. The applicability of hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) was studied as a pyrolysis oil upgrading step to allow FCC co-processing. Different HDO reaction end temperatures (230 – 340 °C) were evaluated in a 5 L autoclave, keeping the other process conditions constant (total 290 bar, 5 wt. % Ru/C catalyst), in order to find the required oil product properties necessary for successful FCC co-processing (miscibility with FCC feed and good yield structure: little gas/coke make and good boiling range liquid yields). After HDO, the upgraded pyrolysis oil underwent phase separation resulting in an aqueous phase, some gases (mainly CO 2 and CH 4), and an oil phase that was further processed in a Micro-Activity Test (MAT) reactor (simulated FCC reactor). Although the oil and aqueous phase yields remained approximately constant when the HDO reaction temperature was increased, a net transfer of organic components (probably hydrodeoxygenated sugars) from the aqueous phase to the oil phase was observed, increasing the carbon recovery in the oil product (up to 70 wt. % of the carbon in pyrolysis oil). The upgraded oils were subsequently tested in a lab scale catalytic cracking unit (MAT reactor), assessing the suitability of HDO oils to be used as FCC feed. In spite of the relatively high oxygen content (from 17 to 28 wt. %, on dry basis) and the different properties of the HDO oils, they all could be successfully dissolved in and co-processed (20 wt. %) with a Long Residue, yielding near normal FCC gasoline (44 – 46 wt. %) and Light Cycle Oil (23 – 25 wt. %) products without an excessive increase of undesired coke and dry gas, as compared to the base feed only. Near oxygenate-free bio-hydrocarbons were obtained, probably via hydrogen transfer from the Long Residue.

Anhydrous and hydrous pyrolysis experiments were conducted on the whole immature source rock, the isolated partially matured bitumen-extracted source rock and the isolated bitumen (bitumen generated and extracted from the initial source rock) and mixtures of the isolated partially matured source rock and bitumen using two types of Hastalloy vessels (22 and 25 ml) at 320 - 420 °C for 7 - 48 h over a pressure range of 115 - 900 bar. Hydrocarbon gas yields and the increase in VR were greater from the whole rock experiments compared to the experiments on the isolated partially matured source rock and isolated bitumen (no mineral matter present), as well as the experiments on mixtures of the isolated partially matured isolated source rock and bitumen combined. The effect of particle size were also found to be of significance as higher gas yields were obtained from recombined mixture experiments using powdered samples (14 % TOC source rocks) compared to using rock chips (30 % TOC source rocks). Hydrocarbon gas yields, pyrobitumen yields, and VR values were found to decrease as pressure increases towards 500 and 900 bar compared to 180 bar at 350 °C where the effects of pressure retardation were found to be much more significant from the partially matured source rock maturation and bitumen in isolation than from the whole source rock.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst additive prepared from acid-modified kaolin microspheres (AMKM) for gasoline sulfur reduction was investigated using N 2 adsorption, IR acid characterization, X-ray diffraction and reaction studies. The additive exhibited improved <b>coke</b> selectivity and <b>yield</b> distribution, and the sulfur content of cracked gasoline was reduced significantly. The results indicated that a reactive mesoporous structure was formed in the modified kaolin. Key words: modified kaolin; catalytic cracking; FCC additive; coke; gasoline; sulfur As an important matrix material, raw kaolin is widely used in commercial FCC catalysts.

The experiments were performed at atmospheric pressure at 780 - 800 OC for starting ratios of steam to naphtha between 0. 5 and 1. 0, with residence times of 0. 1 - 0. 4 s. The influence of the reactor material, the temperature, the ratio of steam to hydrocarbon, the residence tlme, {{and the presence of}} sulfur compounds is discussed in terms of <b>coke</b> formation and <b>yields</b> of various reaction products. The reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography, using packed columns for the analysis of the gaseous products and capillary columns for the liquid products. About 200 compounds were identified in the liquid mixture. Reference standard hydrocarbons, published retention data, and mass spectrometry were used for the identifi 2 ̆ 6 amp;tiOn...|$|R
