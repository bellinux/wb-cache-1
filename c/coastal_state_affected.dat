40|$|This {{systematic}} {{literature review}} describes the epidemiology of dengue disease in Mexico (2000 - 2011). The annual number of uncomplicated dengue cases reported increased from 1, 714 in 2000 to 15, 424 in 2011 (incidence rates of 1. 72 and 14. 12 per 100, 000 population, respectively). Peaks {{were observed in}} 2002, 2007, and 2009. <b>Coastal</b> <b>states</b> were most <b>affected</b> by dengue disease. The age distribution pattern showed {{an increasing number of}} cases during childhood, a peak at 10 - 20 years, and a gradual decline during adulthood. All four dengue virus serotypes were detected. Although national surveillance is in place, there are knowledge gaps relating to asymptomatic cases, primary/secondary infections, and seroprevalence rates of infection in all age strata. Under-reporting of the clinical spectrum of the disease is also problematic. Dengue disease remains a serious public health problem in Mexico...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of {{criteria for the}} identification of 'High Risk Vessels' (HRV) in European waters would allow <b>coastal</b> <b>States</b> to monitor the movements of ships posing significant risk to their interests.

40|$|The {{conservation}} of fish {{stocks in the}} world’s exclusive economic zones (EEZs), which collectively harbour the vast majority of marine-living resources, is the primary responsibility of <b>coastal</b> <b>States.</b> As the effects of failures by <b>coastal</b> <b>States</b> to protect those stocks from the impacts of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing may extend beyond domestic boundaries, this paper questions whether and how <b>coastal</b> <b>States</b> may be made accountable in respect of their regulatory deficits. With the proliferation of non-legal conduct rules to guide the regulatory role of States and their agencies, non-judicial mechanisms have the potential to foster <b>coastal</b> <b>State</b> stewardship of domestic fisheries. Outlining a number of international, transnational and domestic approaches, this paper gives consideration to the opportunities and limitations they present in order to strengthen <b>coastal</b> <b>State</b> accountability for IUU fishing control deficits...|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{implementation of}} Extended Fisheries Jurisdiction (EFJ) has confronted <b>coastal</b> <b>states</b> with several resource management problems. One of these {{consists of the}} economic relations, if any, that the <b>coastal</b> <b>state</b> should establish with distant-water fishing nations (DWFN's) seeking access to the <b>coastal</b> <b>state's</b> 200 -mile zone. Several of the other papers presented here deal with specific aspects of the issue. This paper, on the other hand, will concern itself {{with the question of}} the analytical framework to be used by economists in studying this issue. It will offer some suggestions with respect to possible components of the framework. In doing so, the paper will restrict itself to the <b>coastal</b> <b>state's</b> perspective of EFJ and the management issues arising therefrom. It goes without saying, of course, that an enlightened <b>coastal</b> <b>state</b> will attempt to acquaint itself with the DWFN view of the world...|$|R
40|$|The {{contiguous}} zone is notorious {{for being the}} most poorly defined international maritime zone. Confusion about exactly what enforcement operations can lawfully be conducted by <b>coastal</b> <b>States</b> against foreign ships in the zone has existed from its creation in 1958. Uncertainty about the full legal character of the {{contiguous zone}} has long been recognised as a shortcoming, leading to it being the most poorly utilised maritime zone by <b>coastal</b> <b>States</b> {{with little more than}} half of the 167 States Parties to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC) claiming the zone. The most difficult aspect about the contiguous zone is the scope of the unique preventative powers that may be exercised by <b>coastal</b> <b>States</b> within it, which are limited to four ill-defined topic areas in Article 33 of LOSC (customs, fiscal, immigration and sanitary). This chapter examines the contiguous zone and considers the extent to which it can be utilised by <b>coastal</b> <b>States</b> for environmental protection purposes. A complication in determining the potential utility of the contiguous zone to assist <b>coastal</b> <b>States</b> to combat environmental threats and in encouraging State practice to develop in this regard, is that the zone overlaps the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), in which <b>coastal</b> <b>States</b> have ability to engage in activities to protect and preserve the maritime environment. The key issue is whether the contiguous zone powers enable a fuller suite of actions to be taken in order to protect the environmental interests of the <b>coastal</b> <b>State...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} formation, {{stability}} {{and success of}} an agreement between the <b>coastal</b> <b>states</b> on {{the management of the}} blue whiting fishery under two opposing assumption about the distribution of the stock, based on different climate change scenarios for the Northeast Atlantic Ocean as a result of global warming. Two climate change scenarios for the Northeast Atlantic Ocean are analysed. In one scenario, increased ocean temperature expands the blue whiting’s migration pattern and its area of distribution, making Russia a <b>coastal</b> <b>state</b> with regard to the blue whiting stock in addition to the countries already recognized as such. In this scenario, the stability of the <b>coastal</b> <b>state</b> coalition does not change relative to the Status Quo, i. e., Ekerhovd (2008), although the payoff to the coalition increases when Russia enters. The second scenario looks at the consequences of a colder climate on the distribution of the blue whiting stock. The stock no longer occupies Russian EEZs and Russia is not regarded as a <b>coastal</b> <b>state</b> by the other countries. In this scenario, the stability of the <b>coastal</b> <b>state</b> coalition is severely weakened such that the formation of a <b>coastal</b> <b>state</b> coalition is an even more unlikely outcome compared to Ekerhovd (2008) ...|$|R

40|$|The current {{paper is}} an {{application}} of the analysis of coalition, in particular the partition function approach, to the North East Atlantic blue whiting fishery. In an Exclusive Membership/Coalition Unanimity game, a multiagent, age-structured bioeconomic model simulates the behaviour of the agents in a setting where we allow for partial cooperation between the <b>coastal</b> <b>states</b> consisting of the European Union (EU), the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Norway. We find that in a game played by the Exclusive Membership rules a coalition among all the <b>coastal</b> <b>states</b> is unstable, and cannot be a Nash equilibrium. Therefore, a <b>coastal</b> <b>state</b> agreement seems an unlikely outcome. However, under the more restricted Coalition Unanimity rules, fewer coalition structures are feasible, and the <b>coastal</b> <b>state</b> coalition becomes stable and the noncooperative coalition structure unstable...|$|R

40|$|Almost {{one half}} of the EEZs of the world are subject to {{so-called}} foreign fishing arrangements (FFAs), in which foreign fishing states (distant water fishing states in particular) gain access to EEZs under access arrangements with the relevant <b>coastal</b> <b>states.</b> The FFAs may take the form of “fee fishing” arrangements, joint ventures or charter arrangements. The World Bank undertook a project on FFAs, with particular reference to developing <b>coastal</b> <b>states</b> and launched the resultant project report in December 2014. The report includes a set of case studies, an important one of which is focused on the Bering Sea Pollock fishery. This paper presents an overview of the key findings of the report, including the legal obligations of <b>coastal</b> <b>states</b> concerning FFAs, and the conditions under which the rational <b>coastal</b> <b>state</b> will, or will not, welcome such arrangements. It is argued that <b>coastal</b> <b>states</b> entering into FFAs are properly to be seen as importing harvesting and/or processing and/or marketing services – hence the title of the report: Trade in Fishing Services. Trade in these services, it is argued, constitutes an important, but hitherto largely ignored, component of fisheries international trade. The economics required for the study of FFAs is thus a blend of fisheries economics, international economics, along with principal-agent analysis...|$|R
40|$|Submarine {{intrusions}} were a major {{security issue}} for several <b>coastal</b> <b>states</b> {{in the aftermath}} of World War II and during the Cold War. Recent incidents suggest that this might not only be a problem that belongs to the past. How may then a <b>coastal</b> <b>State</b> defend itself against such intrusions? Is the <b>coastal</b> <b>State</b> entitled to use force? If yes, do human rights influence the legality of the use of force? The topic of this thesis is inspired by what occurred in the Swedish territorial sea in October 2014. Sweden used substantial resources and non-lethal measures to locate what is likely to have been a submarine, without any success. In the aftermath of Sweden’s unsuccessful operation in October 2014, a debate arose in Sweden on the authorization to use potentially lethal force against submarines The objective of this thesis is thus to establish whether the <b>coastal</b> <b>states</b> are entitled to use potentially lethal force against a foreign submarine found in their internal waters or territorial seas. Furthermore, this thesis examines the balance between the right to life in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights and the right of protection of the <b>coastal</b> <b>State</b> {{in the case of a}} submarine intrusion...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{involves an}} analysis {{and discussion of}} the legal regime governing the exploitation of non-living marine resources within national jurisdiction in East Africa. This is {{in light of the}} relatively recent offshore oil and gas discoveries off the coasts of Mozambique and Tanzania which have resulted in offshore exploration activities along the Western Indian Ocean (including the Red Sea) in pursuit of these hydrocarbons. Before delving into legal analysis and discussion, the dissertation departs by providing background on the 1982 United Nations Law of the Sea Convention (LOSC) 2 which is the international legal regime governing maritime spaces and the contributions made by, inter alia, East African <b>coastal</b> <b>States</b> to bring it about. From here, the dissertation ventures into an analysis and discussion of the legal zones claimed by East African <b>coastal</b> <b>States</b> within which exploitation activities may occur. This part of the discussion involves, among other things, an in depth analysis of the practices of East African <b>coastal</b> <b>States</b> as far as establishing maritime zones in terms of international law. The dissertation then proceeds to discuss which East African <b>coastal</b> <b>States</b> have delimited their maritime zones where they overlap with neighbouring States with adjacent and/or opposite coasts. The discussion highlights which States, in terms of international law, have clearly defined the ambit of their maritime jurisdiction by establishing a delimitation boundary where claims to maritime zones overlapped. This part of the dissertation also discusses which States have not delimited their overlapping maritime zones and the reasons for the lack of delimitation. Following this, the dissertation moves on to discuss the LOSC provisions applicable to exploiting non-living resources, and analyse whether the laws of East African <b>coastal</b> <b>States</b> that pertain to exploiting these resources adequately give effect to LOSC. Finally, in light of the above analysis and discussions, the dissertation moves on to establish if whether or not the legal infrastructure of East African <b>coastal</b> <b>States</b> is adequate for exploiting non-living resources within their national jurisdiction. Generally, the findings reflect favourably on the legal framework of East African <b>coastal</b> <b>States.</b> However, the pressing issue is the practices of some States in respect of claiming certain maritime zones and where necessary, not delimiting these zones. This results in uncertainty as to the maritime jurisdiction of a <b>coastal</b> <b>State,</b> especially with resources such as oil and gas which may straddle across boundaries. Moreover, it creates conflict and as such, threatens peace and security in the region as well as stunt economic and socio-economic development. As such, this dissertation, on the one hand, reflects the advancement of East African <b>coastal</b> <b>States</b> from contributing towards the adoption and coming into effect of LOSC, as well as giving effect to it domestically as far as exploiting non-living resources within national jurisdiction is concerned. On the other hand, it highlights the work that lays ahead for East African <b>coastal</b> <b>States</b> {{in order for them to}} fully enjoy their right...|$|R
