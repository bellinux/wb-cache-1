40|$|Thiocyanate is {{a common}} {{contaminant}} of the gold mining and coal <b>coking</b> <b>industries</b> for which biological degradation generally represents the most viable approach to remediation. Recent studies of thiocyanate-degrading bioreactor systems have revealed new information on the structure and metabolic activity of thiocyanate-degrading microbial consortia. Previous knowledge was limited primarily to pure-culture or co-culture studies in which the effects of linked carbon, sulfur and nitrogen cycling could not be fully understood. High throughput sequencing, DNA fingerprinting and targeted gene amplification have now elucidated the genetic and metabolic diversity of these complex microbial consortia. Specifically, this has highlighted the roles of key consortium members involved in sulfur oxidation and nitrification. New insights into the biogeochemical cycling of sulfur and nitrogen in bioreactor systems allow tailoring of the microbial metabolism towards meeting effluent composition requirements. Here we review these rapidly advancing studies and synthesize a conceptual model to inform new biotechnologies for thiocyanate remediation. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Workers in the coking, foundry, and {{aluminum}} industry can {{be exposed to}} high concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and {{are at increased risk}} for lung cancer, as are cigarette smokers. In recent years several studies on workers in the foundry and <b>coking</b> <b>industries</b> have been reported. In these studies, white blood cell(WBC) DNA was used for analysis of PAH-DNA adducts. Theoretically, DNA adduct formation is a more relevant biological parameter for assessing exposure risk than PAH in the work atmosphere, or the amount of a metabolite in the urine, because adduct levels reflect that part of the dose that escapes detoxification and binds to DNA. We analyzed WBC DNA from coke-oven workers and from workers in an aluminum production plant and demonstrated the presence of PAH-DNA adducts. Forty-seven percent of the coke-oven workers had detectable levels of PAH-DNA adducts in their WBC compared with 27 % of the controls (p < 0. 05), measured with ELISA. In both groups, smokers had significantly higher levels of PAH-DNA adducts than did nonsmokers. In the aluminum workers, no PAH-DNA adducts were detected by ELISA, although the benzo[a]pyrene concentrations in the work atmosphere were comparable to those of the coke-oven workers. The more sensitive 32 P-postlabeling assay showed the presence of PAH-DNA adducts in 91 % of the aluminum workers. There was no correlation of WBC adduct levels with the concentration of PAH in the work atmosphere. Recently we showed that total PAH-DNA adduct levels in WBC from lung cancer patients were much higher than those generally found in healthy smokers. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|The {{coking process}} is {{considered}} to be a potential source of unintentionally produced persistent organic pollutants (UP-POPs). However, intensive studies on the emission of UP-POPs from the <b>coking</b> <b>industry</b> are still very scarce. Emission of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs), hexachlorobenzene (HxCBz), and pentachlorobenzene (PeCBz) covered under the Stockholm Convention were investigated for the coking process in this study. Stack gases from some typical coke plants in China were collected and analyzed to estimate the emission of UP-POPs from the <b>coking</b> <b>industry.</b> Emission factors of 28. 9 ng WHO-TEQ tonne(- 1) for PCDD/Fs, 1. 7 ng WHO-TEQ tonne(- 1) for dl-PCBs, 596 ng tonne- 1 for HxCBz, and 680 ng tonne(- 1) for PeCBz were derived based on the investigated data. The annual emissions from the global <b>coking</b> <b>industry</b> were estimated to be 15. 8 g WHO-TEQ for PCDD/Fs, 0. 93 g WHO-TEQ for dl-PCBs, 333 g for HxCBz, and 379 g for PeCBz, respectively (reference year 2007). According to the distribution of PCDD/Fs, we argued for the de novo synthesis to be the major pathway of PCDD/F formation.

40|$|Coke oven liquor is a toxic {{wastewater}} {{produced in}} large quantities by the Iron and Steel, and <b>Coking</b> <b>Industries,</b> and gives rise to major effluent treatment problems in those industries. Conscious of the potentially serious environmental impact of the discharge of such wastes, pollution control agencies in many countries have made progressively more stringent quality requirements for the discharge of the treated waste. The most common means of treating the waste is the activated sludge process. Problems with achieving consistently satisfactory treatment by this process have been experienced in the past. The need {{to improve the quality}} of the discharge of the treated waste prompted attempts by TOMLINS to model the process using Adenosine Triphosophnte (ATP) as a measure of biomass, but these were unsuccessful. This thesis describes work that was carried out to determine the significance of ATP in the activated sludge treatment of the waste. The use of ATP measurements in wastewater treatment were reviewed. Investigations were conducted into the ATP behaviour of the batch activated sludge treatment of two major components of the waste, phenol, and thiocyanate, and the continuous activated sludge treatment of the liquor itself, using laboratory scale apparatus. On the basis of these results equations were formulated to describe the significance of ATP as a measured activity and biomass in the treatment system. These were used as the basis for proposals to use ATP as a control parameter in the activated sludge treatment of coke oven liquor, and wastewaters in general. These had relevance both to the treatment of the waste in the reactor and to the settlement of the sludge produced in the secondary settlement stage of the treatment process...|$|R

40|$|Currently the {{demonstration}} {{of the presence of}} sites contaminated by organic compounds, and the importance of decontamination needs no introduction. Indeed, human activity is generating more and more contaminated soils and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are amongst the contaminants most frequently encountered. Although natural attenuation is often depreciated by people because associated with inaction of contaminated land owners, it might represent a valuable alternative to classical treatments such as physico-chemical treatments. Indeed, this technic aims at reducing the concentration of pollutants while minimizing human intervention and therefore costs. A misunderstanding of this method and a small amount of data available does not encourage its development in France. This present work proposes the results obtained during a long-term natural attenuation assessment in real climatic conditions. This study was performed on seventy-two off ground plots filled with contaminated soils from different former industrial sites (<b>coking</b> <b>industry,</b> manufactured gas plants) whose initial concentration of PAH varies between 380 and 2077 mg/kg.

40|$|Thermal related {{processes}} are {{widely recognized as}} the main sources of formation and emission of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). It is well known that, carbonization of coal in coke production involves many thermal reactions at high-temperature. However, there are still no strong evidences to identify coking processes as source of PCDD/Fs and PCBs. In this study, coke production was qualified and quantified for emission of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs (dl-PCBs) in some typical coke plants in China. In the preliminary investigation, stack gases from three typical coke plants were collected, and dl-PCBs and 2378 -substituted PCDD/Fs were analyzed by isotope dilution HRGC/HRMS technique. The total toxic equivalents of dl-PCBs and PCDD/Fs were {{in the range of}} 1. 6 - 1785. 4 pg WHC-TEQ Nm(- 3).

40|$|Occurrence of {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) during the coking process has been widely recognized. The formation of polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) from PAHs during some thermal related processes has been confirmed in many studies. Thus, the coking process {{is assumed to be}} a potential source of PCNs. However, intensive investigations on PCN emissions during the coking process are lacking. In order to evaluate PCN emissions from the coking process, an intensive study comprising 11 typical coke plants was undertaken. PCNs were qualified and quantified by isotope dilution HRGC/HRMS techniques. The concentrations of PCNs in stack gas samples collected from the investigated coke plants were in the range of 1. 6 - 91. 8 ng Nm(- 3) (0. 08 - 4. 23 pg TEQ Nm(- 3)). The emission factors of PCNs were found to be in the range of 0. 77 - 1. 24 ng TEQ per ton of coke production. The estimated annual toxic emissions of PCNs from the global <b>coking</b> <b>industry</b> vary from 430 to 692 mg TEQs. Characteristics of the PCN profiles were dominated by the lower chlorinated homologues, with mono-CN being the most abundant homologue.

40|$|Work {{completed}} {{under this}} program advances {{the goal of}} demonstrating Western Research Institute's (WRI's) WRITE{trademark} process for upgrading heavy oil at field scale. MEG Energy Corporation (MEG) located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada supported efforts at WRI to develop the WRITE{trademark} process as an oil sands, field-upgrading technology through this Task 51 Jointly Sponsored Research project. The project consisted of 6 tasks: (1) optimization of the distillate recovery unit (DRU), (2) demonstration and design of a continuous coker, (3) conceptual design and cost estimate for a commercial facility, (4) design of a WRITE{trademark} pilot plant, (5) hydrotreating studies, and (6) establish a petroleum analysis laboratory. WRITE{trademark} is a heavy oil and bitumen upgrading process that produces residuum-free, pipeline ready oil from heavy material with undiluted density and viscosity that exceed prevailing pipeline specifications. WRITE{trademark} uses two processing stages to achieve low and high temperature conversion of heavy oil or bitumen. The first stage DRU operates at mild thermal cracking conditions, yielding a light overhead product and a heavy residuum or bottoms material. These bottoms flow to the second stage continuous coker that operates at severe pyrolysis conditions, yielding light pyrolyzate and coke. The combined pyrolyzate and mildly cracked overhead streams form WRITE{trademark}'s synthetic crude oil (SCO) production. The main objectives of this project were to (1) complete testing and analysis at bench scale with the DRU and continuous coker reactors and provide results to MEG for process evaluation and scale-up determinations and (2) complete a technical and economic assessment of WRITE{trademark} technology to determine its viability. The DRU test program was completed and a processing envelope developed. These results were used for process assessment and for scaleup. Tests in the continuous coker were intended to determine the throughput capability of the coker so a scaled design could be developed that maximized feed rate for a given size of reactor. These tests were only partially successful because of equipment problems. A redesigned coker, which addressed the problems, has been build but not operated. A preliminary economic analysis conducted by MEG and an their engineering consultant concluded that the WRITE{trademark} process is a technically feasible method for upgrading bitumen and that it produces SCO that meets pipeline specifications for density. When compared to delayed <b>coking,</b> the <b>industry</b> benchmark for thermal upgrading of bitumen, WRITE{trademark} produced more SCO, less coke, less CO{sub 2 } per barrel of bitumen fed, and had lower capital and operating costs. On the other hand, WRITE{trademark}'s lower processing severity yielded crude with higher density and a different product distribution for naphtha, light gas oil and vacuum oil that, taken together, might reduce {{the value of the}} SCO. These issues plus the completion of more detailed process evaluation and economics need to be resolved before WRITE{trademark} is deployed as a field-scale pilot...|$|R

Electrodialysis (ED) represents a modern progressive electromembrane technology gaining an increasing attention in wastewater recovery. In this work, a bench-scale ED unit has been used to separate nitrate from synthetic solution and industrial wastewater collected from an Egyptian coke plant. Statistical design was applied to study the influence of different parameters (time, nitrate concentration and applied potential) those affecting the nitrate removal efficiency, and a mathematical model was generated. The results on synthetic solutions showed that all studied parameters are effective. The results have been collected at a 3 -D cube that showed that at high levels of parameters (25 min, 15 V and 700 ppm) the nitrate removal efficiency was almost 100 %, while a small nitrate removal efficiency of about 51 % was obtained at the low levels (5 min, 5 V and 100 ppm). The wastewater sample was found to contain several inorganic and organic pollutants those could be separated together with nitrate. Only 2. 5 hrs is sufficient to separate about 80 % of nitrate at 15 V where longer time has no pronounce effect on nitrate separation.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. 'Coke' may {{be described as the}} cellular residue from the carbonisation of a coking coal in commercial ovens or-retorts at a temperature of about 9000 C; and a 'Coking coal' as a coal which will yield a commercial coke when it is carbonised. Some of the questions arising from these descriptions are:- What are the standards required of a commercial coke; what is the cause of coke-formation; what are the characteristics of coking coals and how may they-be judged; and how can the quality of coke be improved? It is not proposed to discuss these questions in detail {{but it is important to}} be aware of them in order to understand the way the <b>coking</b> <b>industry</b> has developed. These questions have been asked since coke has been used on a commercial scale and the answers to them have altered with circumstances as science and technology have changed. The qualities which render a coke most useful, or most readily saleable vary according to the use to which it is to be put. For all combustion processes, which account for most of the coke used, it would be expected that the intrinsic 'combustibility' would be important. The manner in which a ooke burns depends-so much however upon such factors asp for example, the size of the pieces and the rate of supply of air to the fuel-bed, that differences in intrinsic combustibility may be masked. From observation of the various factors upon whioh the usefulness of a coke for particular purposes depends, it is possible to indicate those qualities of a coke which render it most valuable, for all, or most, purposes (Continues [...] .) ...|$|E
40|$|The work {{carried out}} in this paper {{assessed}} how processing conditions and feedstock {{affect the quality of}} the coke produced during microwave coke making. The aim was to gather information that would support the development of an optimised microwave coke making oven. Experiments were {{carried out in}} a non-optimised 2450 MHz cylindrical cavity. The effect of treatment time (15 – 120 min), power input (750 W– 4. 5 kW) and overall power input (1700 – 27, 200 kWh/t) on a range of coals (semi-bituminous–anthracite) was investigated. Intrinsic reactivity, random reflectance, strength index and dielectric properties of the produced cokes were compared with those of two commercial cokes to assess the degree of coking produced in the microwave system. Overall energy input and coal rank were found to be the major factors determining the degree of coking following microwave treatment. The dependency on coal rank was attributed to the larger amount of volatiles that had to be removed from the lower ranked coals, and the increasing dielectric loss of the organic component of the coal with rank due to increased structural ordering. Longer treatment times at lower powers or shorter treatment times at higher powers are expected to produce the same degree of coking. It was concluded that microwave coke making represents a potential step-change in the <b>coking</b> <b>industry</b> by reducing treatment times by an order of magnitude, introducing flexibility and potentially decreasing the sensitivity to quality requirement in the feedstock. The main challenges to development are the energy requirements (which will need to be significantly reduced in an optimised process) and penetration depth (which will require an innovative reactor design to maximise the advantage of using microwaves). Understanding and quantifying the rapidly changing dielectric properties of the coal and coke materials is vital in addressing both of these challenges...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{attenuation}} processes valorization for PAH-contaminated {{soil remediation}} has gained increasing interest from site owners. Indeed, {{far from the}} “do nothing; Nature will take rid of the problem” image, monitored natural attenuation (MNA) offers a valuable, cheaper and environmentally friendly alternative to more classical options such as physicochemical treatments (e. g. chemical oxidation, thermal desorption). The still refractory attitude of regulatory authorities and stakeholders mainly comes from both the lack of studies to really assess the efficiency and threats of this practice but also from its apparent absence of cost for polluters that could seem immoral and against public expectations. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) {{are among the most}} commonly found pollutants. Due to their high hydrophobicity and hence affinity for soil organic matter, there are persistent and they might be released in the environment through numerous ways: natural (e. g. forest fires) or artificial (e. g. fossil fuel combustion), everyday activities (e. g. traffic, household heating) or industrial production (e. g. coking plants, manufactured gas, refineries). For wide areas contaminated with moderately high concentrations and presenting no immediate threat for populations and the environment, MNA may proved a very relevant treatment solution. The present work proposes a long-term in situ evaluation of natural attenuation for management of PAH contaminated soils from different former industrial sites (<b>coking</b> <b>industry,</b> manufactured gas plants). An impact diagnosis was performed on sixty off ground plots that were left to natural attenuation for more than ten years. That included, leaching water analysis, total PAH concentrations, vegetation cover quality and quantity. Data were analyzed using principle component analysis (PCA) with R software and including main soil properties, initial management practices (e. g. fertilizer, liming) and final measurements. Results showed that in average PAH concentrations were reduced by 45 %, which is a rather good result, and that final PAH concentrations were related to particular size (silt fraction) and cation exchange capacity, suggesting that the structure and reactivity of the soil (respectively explaining accessibility and availability of PAH) might influence biodegradation processes. However, these results were also influenced by initial PAH concentration. PAH dissipation rate, which might be more interesting to assess the efficiency of natural attenuation as a treatment, was correlated to dissolved PAH and dissolved organic carbon in leached waters. Initial PAH concentration and initial pH seemed also important in explaining dissipation rates. In particular, liming seemed highly beneficial for degradation. PAH concentrations in leached water remained small, illustrating the relative stability of the residual contamination and minimal risk of transfer. All experimental plants displayed 100 % plant cover with no significant effect of residual pollution on plant diversity. These encouraging results are first elements that could promote natural attenuation to stakeholders for contaminated land management and illustrate the importance for long-term studies...|$|E
