40|$|Research Librarians at the Li Ka Shing Library perform {{multifunctional}} {{roles in}} the areas of collection, information, learning, research and outreach. In this presentation, participants will learn more about the information and learning roles where the former includes the provision of reference and information services and the latter involves the design, development and delivery of instruction and information literacy programmes as part of their student and faculty engagement strategy. They will also learn more about the library’s grounded service offering through a learning roadmap for every student which encompasses the following components: Matriculation [Orientation] 3 ̆e In Class Instruction [Information Literacy] 3 ̆e Research Consultations [Small Group Facilitation] 3 ̆e Thematic Training [Topical Knowledge]. In mid- 2014, a library space transformation project became a surprise catalyst for change management impacting the Reference and Information Service (R 2 ̆ 6 IS) where a new service model of a single desk replaced the separate information desks. This also warranted the team to start thinking about an enhanced service offering given the declining number of enquiries and upskilling of the para-professionals. Research Librarians were doing more in class instruction and information literacy sessions for courses and the amount of Research Consultations began to increase as a result. The presenter will share a personal case study how he curates a Research Consultation for a writing class for the Centre for English Communication (CEC) that forms a nexus between the information literacy session and R 2 ̆ 6 IS. He will elaborate upon Wayne Bivens-Tatum’s (2011) blog posting in which the latter noted that “I tend to think of a research consultation as something in between a standard reference transaction and an instruction session” – an ensuing discussion calling for the need to revisit the Research Consultation as part of R 2 ̆ 6 IS. Scaffolding this, they will hear how through collaboration a new <b>co-location</b> <b>service</b> with the Communication Coaches from the CEC shared the then Information Desk with the Research Librarians and provided the students with a one-stop service within the library. Results from a review of this service will help participants identify practical tips for their own institutions. The presenter will close with parting thoughts on the need to start correlating and triangulating services and data to demonstrate the value and impact of information literacy and instructional classes on reference enquiries where evidence using analytics from self-help tools such as Research Guides, FAQs and online courses in the learning management system help us in our thinking about, we are teaching, but are they learning? and the measurement-value-impact conversation which has already started at the Li Ka Shing Library...|$|E

40|$|On 18 April 2011, the Singapore Exchange (SGX) {{introduced}} <b>co-location</b> <b>services</b> to its equities and derivatives markets. This infrastructural {{improvement was}} part of a 250 million initiative aimed at improving the speed of market access and promoting high frequency trading (HFT). Using intraday data, the impact that this microstructure change has on the market quality and the level of high frequency trading of SGX’s equity-index futures exchange are assessed. This thesis also examines whether structural improvements on offshore markets are beneficial or detrimental to home markets. Increases in the pervasiveness of high frequency trading (HFT) are observed for the Nikkei 225 and MSCI Taiwan index futures contracts. HFT levels in the CNX Nifty and the FTSE China A 50 index futures contracts, however, decline following the infrastructural change. The results suggest that <b>co-location</b> <b>services</b> attract more trading interest from high frequency traders on dual-listed stock index futures exchanges if there are cross-border profit opportunities. This conjecture is supported by the empirical evidence that suggests that HFT trading takes place across borders. An increase in high frequency trading activity on the alternative venue is shown to increase high frequency trading on Singapore’s equity-index futures exchange. The impacts <b>co-location</b> <b>services</b> have on the qualities of the Nikkei 225 and the MSCI Taiwan index futures markedly differ. <b>Co-location</b> <b>services</b> generate more trading activity, improve the liquidity and ease the volatility of the Nikkei 225 index futures market. The quality of the MSCI Taiwan index futures market, however, deteriorates as evident by the decrease in trading activity, decline in liquidity and increase in price volatility. The results suggest that the Nikkei 225 index futures market is characterised by liquidity-supplying passive HFTs while the MSCI Taiwan index futures market is characterised by liquidity-demanding active HFTs...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUbiquitous sensing and {{actuating}} devices are now everywhere {{in our living}} environment {{as part of the}} global cyber–physical ecosystem. Sensing and actuating capabilities can be modeled as services to compose intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) applications. An issue for perpetually running and managing these IoT devices is the energy cost. One energy saving strategy is to co-locate several services on one device {{in order to reduce the}} computing and communication energy. In this paper, we propose a service merging strategy for mapping and co-locating multiple services on devices. In a multi-hop network, the <b>service</b> <b>co-location</b> problem is formulated as a quadratic programming problem. We show a reduction method that reduces it to the integer programming problem. In a single hop network, the <b>service</b> <b>co-location</b> problem can be modeled as the Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem. We show the algorithm to transform a service flow to a co-location graph, then use known heuristic algorithms to find the maximum independent set which is the basis for making <b>service</b> <b>co-location</b> decisions.

30|$|High-frequency trading (HFT), {{also called}} {{algorithmic}} trading, is an imprecise term that currently has no legal or regulatory definition. (See Appendix: Table 3 for {{a listing of}} all of the technical terms in this article, along with their definitions.) It is used to describe a subset of algorithmic trading activities largely associated with the sell side of the financial industry. Algorithmic trading is the use of computer algorithms to automatically make trading decisions, submit securities trades, and manage securities orders after their submission (Investopedia 2015). A 2010 (Securities and Exchange Commission 2010, p. 45) report on market structure offers a detailed description of HFT practices, which involve: “(1) the use of extraordinarily high-speed and sophisticated computer programs for generating, routing, and executing orders; (2) use of <b>co-location</b> <b>services</b> and individual data feeds offered by exchanges and others to minimize network and other types of latencies; (3) very short time-frames for establishing and liquidating positions; (4) the submission of numerous orders that are canceled shortly after their submission; and (5) ending the trading day in as close to a flat position as possible (… not carrying significant, unhedged positions overnight).” It is typical that high-frequency traders end their trading day by squaring up their positions, so they are neither long nor short. They do this to reflect the fact that they trade on information moment to moment, rather than with longer-term strategies from day to day. Numerous authors have recognized the potential for controversy, problems, and legal issues (McGowan 2010).|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Co-leadership {{has been}} {{identified}} as one approach to meet the managerial challenges of integrated services, but research on the topic is limited. In the present study, co-leadership, practised by pairs of managers – each manager representing one of the two principal organizations in integrated health and social care services – was explored. Aim: To investigate co-leadership in integrated health and social care, identify essential preconditions in fulfilling the management assignment, its operationalization and impact on provision of sustainable integration of health and social care. Method: Interviews with eight managers exercising co-leadership were analysed using directed content analysis. Respondent validation was conducted through additional interviews with the same managers. Results: Key contextual preconditions were an organization-wide model supporting co-leadership and <b>co-location</b> of <b>services.</b> Perception of the management role as a collective activity, continuous communication and lack of prestige were essential personal and interpersonal preconditions. In daily practice, office sharing, being able to give and take and support each other contributed to provision of sustainable integration of health and social care.   Conclusion and discussion: Co-leadership promoted robust management by providing broader competence, continuous learning and joint responsibility for services. Integrated health and social care services should consider employing co-leadership as a managerial solution to achieve sustainability...|$|R
40|$|Injection {{drug use}} (IDU) plays a {{critical}} role in the HIV epidemic in several countries throughout the world. In these countries, injection drug users are at significant risk for both HIV and tuberculosis, and active IDU negatively impacts treatment access, adherence and retention. Comprehensive strategies are therefore needed to effectively deliver preventive, diagnostic and curative services to these complex patient populations. We propose that developing co-located integrated care delivery systems should become the focus of national programmes as they continue to scale-up access to antiretroviral medications for drug users. Existing data suggest that such a programme will expand services for each of these diseases; increase detection of tuberculosis (TB) and HIV; improve medication adherence; increase entry into substance use treatment; decrease the likelihood of adverse drug events; and improve the effectiveness of prevention interventions. Key aspects of integration programmes include: <b>co-location</b> of <b>services</b> convenient to the patient; provision of effective substance use treatment, including pharmacotherapies; cross-training of generalist and specialist care providers; and provision of enhanced monitoring of drug-drug interactions and adverse side effects. Central to implementing this agenda will be fostering the political will to fund infrastructure and service delivery, expanding street-level outreach to IDUs, and training community health workers capable of cost effectively delivering these services.

40|$|Background: Retention in HIV care {{improves}} {{survival and}} {{reduces the risk of}} HIV transmission to others. Multiple quantitative studies have described demographic and clinical characteristics associated with retention in HIV care. However, qualitative studies are needed to better understand barriers and facilitators. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 51 HIV-infected individuals, 25 who were retained in care and 26 not retained in care, from 3 urban clinics. Interview data were analyzed for themes using a modified grounded theory approach. Identified themes were compared between the two groups of interest: patients retained in care and those not retained in care. Results: Overall, participants identified 12 barriers and 5 facilitators to retention in HIV care. On average, retained individuals provided 3 barriers, while persons not retained in care provided 5 barriers. Both groups commonly discussed depression/mental illness, feeling sick, and competing life activities as barriers. In addition, individuals not retained in care commonly reported expensive and unreliable transportation, stigma, and insufficient insurance as barriers. On average, participants in both groups referenced 2 facilitators, including the presence of social support, patient-friendly clinic <b>services</b> (transportation, <b>co-location</b> of <b>services,</b> scheduling/reminders), and positive relationships with providers and clinic staff. Conclusions: In our study, patients not retained in care faced more barriers, particularly social and structural barriers, than those retained in care. Developing care models where social and financial barriers are addressed, mental health and substance abuse treatment is integrated, and patient-friendly services are offered is important to keeping HIV-infected individuals engaged in care...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Internationally, non-medical {{practitioners}} are increasingly involved in tasks traditionally undertaken by general practitioners (GPs), such as medication review and prescribing. This study aims to evaluate GPs' perceptions of pharmacists' contributions to those services. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews {{were carried out}} in two localities with GPs whose patients had and had not undergone a pharmacist-led adherence support Medication Use Review (MUR). GPs were asked their opinions of pharmacists' provision of MUR, clinical medication review and prescribing. Data were analysed thematically using NVivo 8 and grouped by strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) category. FINDINGS: Eighteen GPs were interviewed. GPs mentioned their own skills, training and knowledge of clinical conditions. These were considered GPs' major strengths. GPs' perceived weaknesses were their time constraints and heavy workloads. GPs thought pharmacists' strengths were their knowledge of pharmacology and having more time for in-depth medication review than GPs. Nevertheless, GPs felt pharmacist-led medication reviews might confuse patients, and increase GP workloads. GPs were concerned that pharmacist prescribing might include pharmacists making a diagnosis. This is not the proposed model for New Zealand. In general, GPs were more accepting of pharmacists providing medication reviews than of pharmacist prescribing, unless appropriate controls, close collaboration and <b>co-location</b> of <b>services</b> took place. CONCLUSION: GPs perceived their own skills were well suited to reviewing medication and prescribing, but thought pharmacists might also have strengths and skills in these areas. In future, GPs thought that working together with pharmacists in these services might be possible in a collaborative setting...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} issues of {{building}} and managing future Internet of Things (IoT) systems. IoT systems consist of distributed components with services for sensing, processing, and controlling through devices deployed in our living environment {{as part of the}} global cyber-physical ecosystem. Systems with perpetually running IoT devices may use a lot of energy. One challenge is implementing good management policies for energy saving. In addition, a large scale of devices may be deployed in wide geographical areas through low bandwidth wireless communication networks. This brings the challenge of congfiuring a large number of duplicated applications with low latency in a scalable manner. Finally, intelligent IoT applications, such as occupancy prediction and activity recognition, depend on analyzing user and event patterns from historical data. In order to achieve real-time interaction between humans and things, reliable yet real-time analytic support should be included to leverage the interplay and complementary roles of edge and cloud computing. In this dissertation, I address the above issues from the service oriented point of view. Service oriented architecture (SOA) provides the integration and management flexibility using the abstraction of services deployed on devices. We have designed the WuKong IoT middleware to facilitate connectivity, deployment, and run-time management of IoT applications. For energy efficient mapping, this thesis presents an energy saving methodology for co-locating several services on the same physical device {{in order to reduce the}} computing and communication energy. In a multi-hop network, the <b>service</b> <b>co-location</b> problem is formulated as a quadratic programming problem. I propose a reduction method that reduces it to the integer programming problem. In a single hop network, the <b>service</b> <b>co-location</b> problem can be modeled as the Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem. I design algorithm to transform a service flow to a co-location graph. Then, known heuristic algorithms to find the maximum independent set, which is the basis for making <b>service</b> <b>co-location</b> decisions, are applied to the co-location graph. For low latency scalable deployment, I propose a region-based hierarchical management structure. A congestion zone that covers multiple regions is identified. The problem of deploying a large number of copies of a flow-based program (FBP) in a congestion zone is modeled as a network traffic congestion problem. Then, the problem of mapping in a congestion zone is modeled as an Integer Quadratic Constrained Programming (IQCP) problem, which is proved to be a NP-hard problem. Given that, an approximation algorithm based on LP relaxation and an efficient service relocating heuristic algorithm are designed for reducing the computation complexity. For each congestion zone, the algorithm will perform global optimized mapping for multiple regions, and then request multiple deployment delegators for reprogramming individual devices. Finally, with the growing adoption of IoT applications, dedicated and single-purpose devices are giving way to smart, adaptive devices with rich capabilities using a platform or API, collecting and analyzing data, and making their own decisions. To facilitate building intelligent applications in IoT, I have implemented the edge framework for supporting reliable streaming analytics on edge devices. In addition, a progression framework is built to achieve the self-management capability of applications in IoT. A progressive architecture and a programming paradigm for bridging the service oriented application with the power of big data on the cloud are designed in the framework. In this thesis, I present the detailed design of the progression framework, which incorporates the above features for building scalable management of IoT systems through a flexible middleware...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} tendencies of <b>co-location</b> between {{producer}} <b>services</b> and manufacturing across Swedish functional regions. The employment in these industries is modeled as being determined simultaneously, i. e. {{the location of}} producer services {{is a function of}} the location of manufacturing and vice versa. The rationale for the simultaneous approach comes from an assumption of a supplier-customer relation between the two categories of industries. Manufacturing firms benefit from short-distance supply of producer services. The service suppliers benefit from accessibility to customers among the manufacturing firms. Accessibility based on time distances is incorporated into the analysis to allow for inter-regional effects. Controlling for the availability of a skilled workforce and the size of the private sector for producer services and the average wage-level and the size of the private sector for manufacturing, the empirical results suggest that the location manufacturing employment can be explained by its accessibility to producer services. However, accessibility to manufacturing is not a statistically significant explanatory factor for the location of producer services. The interpretation is that many producer services are produced for other service industries, which is consistent with previous empirical results. Also, the results indicate that the elasticity of knowledge intensive manufacturing with respect to (w. r. t) accessibility to producer services is smaller than the elasticity of non-knowledge intensive manufacturing w. r. t accessibility to producer services. co-location; manufacturing; producer services; accessibility...|$|R
40|$|The {{provision}} of services in rural areas is constrained {{by a number of}} issues arising from the remoteness of such areas and the relative sparsity of rural populations. These factors combine to increase the cost of supply and reduce the demand for services, which consequently threatens the viability of service provision whether by the public or private sectors. A possible to solution to these issues lies in the <b>co-location</b> of rural <b>services,</b> which in general means that two or more distinct services are located within the same premises thus reducing the delivery costs associated with {{one or more of these}} services. Beyond the simple economics of service provision lies the existence of non-market elements of services in terms of benefits to local communities of service provision that might arise from the social elements of local provided services such as community cohesion. This paper applies non-market valuation to quantify these benefits in three case studies across Scotland. The results indicate that relative degree of these benefits can be related to the remoteness of rural communities in that more remote communities particularly value the community aspects of services whereas less remote communities are more resistant to increased distances to access services. More generally, the results provide evidence on the inherent trade-offs between factors such as opening hours, levels of service and distance that can be used in determining the optimal configuration of service provision.

40|$|Aim: This paper {{explores the}} impact of models of {{integrated}} services for pregnant women, children and families {{and the nature of}} collaboration between midwives, child and family health nurses and general practitioners. Background: Increasingly, maternity and child health services are establishing integrated service models {{to meet the needs of}} pregnant women, children and families particularly those vulnerable to poor outcomes. Little is known about the nature of collaboration between professionals or {{the impact of}} service integration across universal health services. Design: Discursive paper. Methods: A literature search was conducted using a range of databases and combinations of relevant keywords to identify papers reporting the process, and/or outcomes of collaboration and integrated models of care. Results: There is limited literature describing models of collaboration or reporting outcomes. Several whole-of-government and community-based integrated service models have been trialled with varying success. Effective communication mechanisms and professional relationships and boundaries are key concerns. Liaison positions, multidisciplinary teams and <b>service</b> <b>co-location</b> have been adopted to communicate information, facilitate transition of care from one service or professional to another and to build working relationships. Conclusions: Currently, collaboration between universal health services predominantly reflects initiatives to move services from the level of coexistence to models of cooperation and coordination. Relevance to clinical practice: Integrated service models are changing the way professionals are working. Collaboration requires knowledge of the roles and responsibilities of colleagues and skill in communicating effectively with a diverse range of professionals to establish care pathways with referral and feedback mechanisms that generate collegial respect and trust...|$|R
40|$|Summary: One {{expression}} of partnership between two organizations is {{the sharing of}} office space, often known as co-location. In early 2006, case managers employed by Loddon Mallee Housing Services (LMHS), a community-based organization in the regional city of Bendigo, Australia, co-located with the Bendigo office of Centrelink, the Australian government’s statutory income support agency. This article explores Centrelink and LMHS staff and management expectations of co-location {{as well as the}} reality of co-location as experienced by the staff involved. It is based on interviews conducted with staff and managers before co-location occurred and again six months thereafter. • Findings: Co-location is a powerful strategy for strengthening inter-agency relationships. The Bendigo example of <b>service</b> <b>co-location</b> provides confirmation of the benefits of co-location suggested in previous literature, including greater respect and trust between professionals from different backgrounds and with different status; informal information exchange, learning and sharing; enhanced feelings of teamwork and belonging; improved morale among staff; and enhanced communication, learning and understanding of roles. • Application: This study found that key issues requiring attention by organizations contemplating co-location include building on pre-existing trust and goodwill; thorough planning, taking into account the potential impact of co-location on third parties as well as client and organizational priorities; attending to logistical details, taking particular account of timelines for connection of telephones and internet access; consulting widely and including all relevant stakeholders in decision-making processes; promoting flexible attitudes and openness to change among affected staff; and seeking to acknowledge and contain rather than remove differences in organizational culture and practice. Compatibility, rather than sameness, should be the goal. ...|$|R
40|$|Myocarditis and {{cardiomyopathy}} {{are rarely}} reported complications of clozapine treatment. The incidence of clozapine-related myocarditis has been variably reported at between 0. 03 % and 0. 19 % of initiations and cardiomyopathy {{has been reported}} even less commonly. In our Brisbane-based service, nine of 94 patients initiated on clozapine over the previous 3 years appeared to have experienced myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. The unique <b>co-location</b> of our <b>service</b> with a major cardiothoracic hospital facilitated a review of identified cases to inform decisions regarding clozapine treatment and rechallenge in this service. Method: Cases were identified by survey of psychiatric and cardiac medical staff at The Prince Charles Hospital and subjected to re-evaluation by a multidiscipline consensus panel. The panel compared cases to international reports and identified the clinical features that supported a diagnosis of clozapine-related myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. Results: This process resulted in the stratification of the nine cases into the following categories of diagnostic likelihood: three highly probable, three probable, and two possible cases of clozapine-related myocarditis, and one possible case of clozapine-related cardio-myopathy. Successful clozapine rechallenge/continuation was undertaken in two patients and the panel agreed {{that this was a}} viable future option for several other patients. Conclusions: Findings of the panel review supported the initial clinical diagnoses. This confirmed that there was an apparent high incidence of clozapine-related myocarditis within this service, for which there was no clear reason. Mechanisms underlying clozapine-related myocarditis and cardiomyopathy, as well as successful clozapine continuation and rechal-lenge were considered, but definitive explanations remain unknown. This review highlighted the clinician’s role in post-marketing drug surveillance to guide rational management of suspected adverse drug effects. Key words...|$|R
