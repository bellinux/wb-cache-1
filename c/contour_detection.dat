Cardiac tagged MRI allows the measurement of anatomical and functional myocardial parameters. This protocol generates a dark grid which is deformed with the myocardium. Tracking the grid allows the displacement estimation in the myocardium. The work described in this paper aims to automate the myocardial <b>contours</b> <b>detection</b> and the following of the grids of tags on short-axis and long-axis time sequences, in order to firstly optimize the 3 D+T study of the parietal contractions and secondly make possible its clinical use. The method we have developed for endocardial and epicardial <b>contours</b> <b>detection</b> {{is based on the}} use of texture analysis and active contours models. Texture analysis allows us to define energy maps more efficient than those usually used in active contours methods where attractor is often based on gradient and which were useless in our case of study. The follow-up of the grid of tags that we have implemented is based on a grid of active contours (B-snakes) which part of the energy is calculated in the Fourier's domain.

50|$|Detecting visual contours, edges, or {{boundaries}} is {{an important}} function in human and computer vision which facilitates figure-ground segmentation and object recognition. Contour integration depends on a subject’s ability to link representations of separate visual stimuli into a coherent percept. Subjects with schizophrenia {{have been shown to}} perform worse than healthy adults on tasks that depend on contour integration, and these deficits may be related to factors such as illness severity, chronicity, and degree of disorganized symptoms. In these experiments, subjects often viewed stimuli that could be connected to form a coherent perception of a line, like a simplified connect the dots puzzle. It is worth noting that in general, the magnitude of visual processing abnormalities (such as abnormal <b>contour</b> <b>detection</b> performance) in schizophrenia are fairly small. Therefore, {{it may be necessary to}} examine experimental data from a large number of subjects in order to observe difference between healthy adults and those with schizophrenia using statistical methods.It has been proposed that weaker lateral excitation due to deficient NMDA-receptor functioning could disrupt neural processing, and that this might underlie problems with contour integration in schizophrenia. This idea is consistent with the Glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia, as dysfunction in this neurotransmitter system may explain symptoms observed in this disorder.|$|E
5000|$|Face {{perception}} {{is a function}} of the visual system which is critical for social behavior. Patients with schizophrenia have shown abnormalities in tasks designed to probe facial processing and recognition. [...] Specifically, performance deficits have been observed in this disorder when subjects were asked to identify degraded pictures of faces, and the deficits observed were specific to patients with predominantly disorganized symptoms. Another experiment using the same stimuli during EEG found poorer performance and slower reaction times among patients with schizophrenia, as well as abnormalities in beta band activity. The authors state that these results are related to deficits in long range coordination of neural activity, as described for <b>contour</b> <b>detection.</b> Another experiment using EEG and structural MRI to examine facial processing abnormalities in schizophrenia found decreased N170 component responses in patients, and this was correlated with decreased gray matter volumes in the fusiform gyrus. There is evidence that the fusiform face area is a visual cortical region that may be specialized for detecting faces. The authors of this study conclude that their data support a specific face processing deficit in schizophrenia. However, another study using fractured images of faces found that patients with schizophrenia were better than healthy adults at identifying images of famous people that had been distorted. These experiments state that this may be evidence of weaker [...] "configural" [...] processing in schizophrenia patients, who instead may rely more on local image features for face identification, as these were preserved in their image manipulation.|$|E

Spatial images being captured are easily affected or corrupted by band correlation. For feature discovery like edge, region and <b>contour</b> <b>detections,</b> critical changes in object properties are captured via detecting sharp variations in image brightness. Due to band correlation, false detection occurs frequently, leading to information loss and feature deformity. Since classical approaches are lack of accuracy, artificial intelligence is introduced to strengthen feature detection.

By simulating the foraging behaviors of ants, ACO performs local and global search simultaneously. It can effectively handle effects of band correlation.
