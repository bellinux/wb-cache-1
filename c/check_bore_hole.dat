40|$|Indonesia is {{a country}} that located at the {{confluence}} of three major plates, making it prone to ground movements disaster. PT. Astra Otoparts (limited) is a company that set up branch office in semarang and located in areas that experiencing local mass movement (local). This happens because there is a slip plane, has a lithology that consits of soil embankment and clay that has low value of cohesion and poor consistency. Therefore, it should be made ground investigation to determine how much strength and physical condition of the soil, so as to know the proper methods to overcome these problems. The method used is grouting, but before doing grouting, grouting experiments needs to be done, ie grouting test. Grouting test is a method that used to determine the effectiveness of the grouting to be done. Based on the analysis that has been done, we can know that the grouting method can increase the carrying capacity of the land on the foundation of the building. After the measurement, the value of N-spt increase from 2 up to 19 in the CH- 2 and in CH- 1 up to 21 in depth 4. 50 m to 5. 00 m. In the depth 9. 50 m to 10. 00 m at each <b>check</b> <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> the value of N-spt from the previous 16 - 21 up to more than 60 in each hole. In the depth 14. 50 m to 15. 00 m at each <b>check</b> <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> the value of N-spt increased from the previous 48 - 49 up to more than 60. Efforts to increase the value of SPT with grouting method on soil that has a low bearing capacity at PT. Astra Otoparts successfully performed, so that the process of building PT. Astra Otoparts can proceed. Key word : mass movement, grouting, soil strength...|$|E

30|$|Let a DS be {{lowering}} {{in a plane}} circular <b>bore</b> <b>hole.</b> Then, it slides along the <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> bottom line and its axis line is a circle of a radius ρ + a, where ρ is the radius of the <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> axis T and a is the system clearance. In sliding, the DS is subjected to action of gravity (f gr), contact (f cont), and friction (f fr) forces. In consequence of these forces, the DS can be compressed in some segments of its length where it can begin to buckle without losing its contact with the well wall. It is necessary to predict the critical states of the DS and to construct the modes of its stability loss.|$|R
30|$|Not long ago, rather shallow wells {{with simple}} {{outlines}} were drilled {{in oil and}} gas fields. However, at the present time, deeper and more complicated trajectories of <b>bore</b> <b>holes</b> are designed in connection with exhaustion of easily accessible hydrocarbon sources. In 2015, the record 13.5  km horizontal <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> was drilled in the Sakhalin region, Russia. According to experts’ opinions, most of the substantial achievements in the power engineering of the current century are associated with this technical direction. Particularly, some {{are related to the}} pioneering investigation of industrial extraction of shale oil and gas, whose deposits in the world essentially exceed conventional reserves. However, as a rule, drilling of such <b>bore</b> <b>holes</b> is attended by extraordinary phenomena bringing emergency situations. One of them is unstable bending buckling of a drill string (DS) in the channel of a curvilinear <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> (Brett et al. 1989; Dawson and Paslay 1984; Kyllingstad 1995; Sawaryn et al. 2006; Gulyayev et al. 2009; Gao and Liu 2013; Huang and Gao 2014; Gao and Huang 2015). This effect is associated with deterioration of conditions of contact interaction between the DS and the <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> wall, enlargement of friction forces, impossibility of transferring the required axial force to the bit, and the DS lockup situation. To predict these effects and exclude them in practice, computer simulation should be employed.|$|R

40|$|Induced {{hydraulic}} {{fracture of}} strata during roof bolt installation is a potentially prevalent, but masked phenomenon within the underground coal industry. Previously reported resin testing programs (McTyre et al., 2014) {{examined the relationship}} between resin mixing effectiveness and varying <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> diameter. The methodology employed within this earlier test program facilitated a further critical area of research – the measurement of back pressures generated within the <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> during standard rock bolt installation practices. Experimental data has indicated that fluid resin can be pressurised to levels where it exceeds the compressive strength of the strata, inducing hydraulic fracture within the immediate area of the bolting horizon. The routine cycle of roof bolting serves to propagate this effect, progressively fracturing and delaminating the roof during mine advancement. This masked phenomenon can lead to a perception of difficult ground conditions - mining efficiencies and costs are therefore affected, with increased need for additional support subsequently required to re-stabilise the inadvertently damaged roof. Further analysis of the parameters associated with resin bolt installation has now been conducted, assisting in the development of an empirical relationship between <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> pressure, <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> diameter and bolt insertion times. This relationship has been analysed for 15 : 1 ratio resins and 2 : 1 ratio resins, within 28 mm and 30 mm boreholes. Further to this, load transfer performance has been comparatively assessed for both 28 mm and 30 mm boreholes, suggesting that for 2 : 1 resins, acceptable resin mixing and load transfer can be obtained within a 30 mm <b>bore</b> <b>hole.</b> The combination of 2 : 1 resins, utilised within a 30 mm <b>bore</b> <b>hole,</b> may well provide the optimal solution {{to reduce the risk of}} hydraulic fracture in weaker strata during resin bolt installation...|$|R
50|$|Geological {{formations}} of {{shale gas}} are being explored {{as a new}} source of energy. A technique known as horizontal drilling is used to create a horizontal <b>bore</b> <b>hole,</b> through a formation. Water under high pressure is then pumped into the <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> where it fractures the shale and allows the gas to escape the rock and seep up the <b>bore</b> <b>hole.</b> There are a number of shale gas fields in Canada including the Shallow Colorado basin in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, the Bakken, in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, the Antrim in Southern Ontario and the Utica in south east Quebec. The technique is not without problems for the fracturing can affect aquifers causing contamination and deviation. To date efforts at production in Canada have been limited to exploratory wells.|$|R

To meet these requirements, an adaption of the deep hole drilling process is necessary.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{was to develop a}} method of {{determining}} far-field principal stress magnitude and orientation using biaxial stress measurements made in a series of <b>bore</b> <b>holes.</b> Two novel developments were employed: one was a method for relating biaxial measurements from three <b>bore</b> <b>holes</b> to the triaxial principal stress field; the other was a measurement technique that fully defines the biaxial stress field around a <b>bore</b> <b>hole,</b> independent of rock properties. To determine the triaxial principal stress field, a series of simultaneous equations describing biaxial measurements in terms of a random baseline coordinate system was developed. A least squares regression was then utilized to determine the coordinate system 2 ̆ 7 s stress field. A Newton-Raphson reduction was subsequently performed to define the orientation and magnitude of the principal stress field. The biaxial stress measurement technique employs two loading mechanisms and ultrasonic crack detection. The biaxial stress field in <b>bore</b> <b>holes</b> with nonhomogeneous and anisotropic rock conditions can be defined.

30|$|Enhancement of {{technology}} and techniques for drilling deep directed oil and gas <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> {{is one of the}} most important problems of the current petroleum industry. Not infrequently, the drilling of these <b>bore</b> <b>holes</b> is attended by occurrence of extraordinary situations associated with technical accidents. Among these is the Eulerian loss of stability of a drill string in the channel of a curvilinear <b>bore</b> <b>hole.</b> Methods of computer simulation should play a dominant role in prediction of these states. In this paper, a new statement of the problem of critical buckling of the drill strings in 3 D curvilinear <b>bore</b> <b>holes</b> is proposed. It is based on combined use of the theory of curvilinear elastic rods, Eulerian theory of stability, theory of channel surfaces, and methods of classical mechanics of systems with nonlinear constraints. It is noted that the stated problem is singularly perturbed and its solutions have the shapes of localized harmonic wavelets. The calculation results showed that the friction effects lead to essential redistribution of internal axial forces, as well as changing the eigenmode shapes and sites of their localization. These features make the buckling phenomena less predictable and raise the role of computer simulation of these effects.|$|R
