25|$|In 1982, {{a license}} & Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) was signed between Maruti Udyog Ltd, and Suzuki of Japan. At first, Maruti Suzuki was mainly an {{importer}} of cars. In India's <b>closed</b> <b>market,</b> Maruti received {{the right to}} import 40,000 fully built-up Suzukis {{in the first two}} years, and even after that the early goal was to use only 33% indigenous parts. This upset the local manufacturers considerably. There were also some concerns that the Indian market was too small to absorb the comparatively large production planned by Maruti Suzuki, with the government even considering adjusting the petrol tax and lowering the excise duty in order to boost sales. Finally, in 1983, the Maruti 800 was released. This 796 cc hatchback was based on the SS80 Suzuki Alto and was India’s first affordable car. Initial product plan was 40% saloons, and 60% Maruti Van. Local production commenced in December 1983. In 1984, the Maruti Van with the same three-cylinder engine as the 800 was released and the installed capacity of the plant in Gurgaon reached 40,000 units.|$|E

[...] This would mean that land could be bought and sold but only between Palm Islanders. It is unclear whether this arrangement would allow for mortgages as the banks who give the loans are outside the community and would require security for their loan that they can legally collect.|$|E

50|$|In {{a liberal}} market economy (LME) with a decentralized, open market, the {{knowledge}} regimes {{tend to be}} more market-oriented, meaning there are less external constraints from the government. In open markets there is more competition between companies and actors, resulting in a more adversarial environment. In an LME with a more centralized and <b>closed</b> <b>market,</b> there is nonpartisan state-involvement, all the while in a hostile environment. In coordinated market economies (CME) with decentralized, open states, there are strong associational institutional arrangements, which results in more consensus-oriented knowledge regimes whereas in a CME with a centralized <b>closed</b> <b>market,</b> policy changes come from within the state.|$|E

50|$|France is {{a country}} with a coordinated market economy, {{distinguished}} by a central government and a <b>closed</b> <b>market.</b> In France, the central government is the main actor when making economic decisions and solving financial problems; the government holds sole ownership of several of the main infrastructure sectors throughout the country, weakening state-firm relationships. With a central government, the same political party holds control of both the legislative and executive branches, resulting in much of policy making taking place at the national level.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} pricing {{strategies}} and ontract choice of an up-stream manufacturer who sells to both competitive and monopolistic re-tailers in different locations. To prevent arbitrage, {{he sets the}} wholesale price difference between locations smaller than the transportation cost. This magnifies the problem of double marginalization. When some re-tail markets become more competitive, the manufacturer reacts in monop-olized markets by (i) charging a higher wholesale price, (ii) using linear contracts instead of two-part tariffs, and (iii) <b>closing</b> down <b>markets.</b> Ban-ning price discrimination can cause the manufacturer to switch to use an inferior type of contracts and to <b>close</b> <b>markets,</b> reducing welfare...|$|R
