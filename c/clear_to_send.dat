60|$|The large {{majority}} of the Natalians consider that his restoration would {{be an act of}} suicidal folly, and their opinion is certainly entitled to great weight, since they are after all the people principally concerned. The issue of the experiment would be a matter of comparative indifference to people living 7000 miles away, but is naturally regarded with some anxiety by those who have their homes on the borders of Zululand. It is very well to sympathise with savage royalty in distress, but it must be borne in mind that there are others to be considered besides the captive king. Many of the Zulus, for instance, are by no means anxious to see him again, since they look forward with just apprehension to the line of action he may take with those who have not shown sufficient anxiety for his return, or have in other ways incurred his resentment. One thing is <b>clear,</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> the king back to Zululand is to restore the status in quo as it was before the war. There can be no half measures about it, no more worthless paper stipulations; a Zulu king must either be allowed to rule in his own fashion or not at all. The war would go for nothing, and would doubtless have to be fought over again with one of Cetywayo's successors.|$|E

60|$|In {{the spring}} the {{inspector}} {{was sent to}} report on the school, and, of course, he said, with a wave of his hand, that this would never do. So a new school was built, and the ramshackle little academy that had done good service in its day was closed for the last time. For years it had been without a lock; ever since a blatter of wind and rain drove the door against the fireplace. After that it was the dominie's custom, on seeing the room <b>cleared,</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> in a smart boy--a dux was always chosen--who wedged a clod of earth or peat between doorpost and door. Thus the school was locked up for the night. The boy came out by the window, where he entered to open the door next morning. In time grass hid the little path from view that led to the old school, and a dozen years ago every particle of wood about the building, including the door and the framework of the windows, had been burned by travelling tinkers.|$|R

40|$|What {{do we do}} when we realise {{that others}} with whom we {{interact}} already know something about relevant qualities of ours? Do we relying on {{the information that we}} naturally emit to get our message across, or do we take actions to try to change the situation in our favour? And, does the information that we emit, generated intentionally or unintentionally, allow us to cooperate with others and conflict to be resolved peacefully? Drawing on signalling and 'countersignalling' theories, and a recent behavioural theory, I explore these questions using two experiments in which the relevant qualities are trustworthiness and toughness, and observational data from the 1997 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities concerning violence among prisoners. In the experiments, subjects, who do not know what will follow, initially create a natural indicator of their qualities, and subsequently, have the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>send</b> another indicator, this time fully informed. In one experiment, consistent with countersignalling theory, subjects whose generosity is <b>clear</b> deign <b>to</b> <b>send</b> further information, while those whose generosity can be called under question choose to update their initial action the most. In the other, the toughest subjects put the most effort into getting their message across. Consistent among both, senders' actions correspond to receivers' evaluations. Finally, I find that pertinent information can allow conflicts to be resolved successfully; it is linked with less violence in prison and in a laboratory-based contest.

The drought in southern Brazil in 2010 is believed to be due to the drying up of the flying rivers, and the even worse 2014-5 drought is also attributed to this.|$|R

50|$|RSSI {{can be used}} {{internally}} in {{a wireless}} networking card to determine when the amount of radio energy in the channel is below a certain threshold {{at which point the}} network card is <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> (CTS).

The end-user will likely observe a RSSI value when measuring the signal strength of a wireless network {{through the use of a}} wireless network monitoring tool like Wireshark, Kismet or Inssider. As an example, Cisco Systems cards have an RSSI maximum value of 100 and will report 101 different power levels, where the RSSI value is 0 to 100. Another popular Wi-Fi chipset is made by Atheros. An Atheros-based card will return an RSSI value of 0 to 127 (0x7f) with 128 (0x80) indicating an invalid value.|$|E

50|$|Selective Repeat is a {{connection}} oriented protocol in which both transmitter and receiver have a window of sequence numbers.The protocol has a maximum number of messages that can be sent without acknowledgement.

50|$|CSMA/CA can {{optionally}} be {{supplemented by}} {{the exchange of}} a Request to Send (RTS) packet sent by the sender S, and a <b>Clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>Send</b> (CTS) packet sent by the intended receiver R. Thus alerting all nodes within range of the sender, receiver or both, to not transmit {{for the duration of}} the main transmission. This is known as the IEEE 802.11 RTS/CTS exchange. Implementation of RTS/CTS helps to partially solve the hidden node problem that is often found in wireless networking.|$|E
50|$|Node A initiates {{the process}} by sending a Request to Send frame (RTS) to node B. The {{destination}} node (node B) replies with a <b>Clear</b> <b>To</b> <b>Send</b> frame (CTS). After receiving CTS, node A sends data. After successful reception, node B replies with an acknowledgement frame (ACK). If node A has to send more than one data fragment, it has to wait a random time after each successful data transfer and compete with adjacent nodes for the medium using the RTS/CTS mechanism.|$|E

5000|$|Request to Send/Clear to Send (RTS/CTS) may {{optionally}} {{be used at}} {{this point}} to mediate access to the shared medium. This goes some way to alleviating the problem of hidden nodes because, for instance, in a wireless network, the Access Point only issues a <b>Clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>Send</b> to one node at a time. However, wireless 802.11 implementations do not typically implement RTS/CTS for all transmissions; they may turn it off completely, or at least not use it for small packets (the overhead of RTS, CTS and transmission is too great for small data transfers).|$|E
50|$|In this cable {{the flow}} control lines are still looped {{back to the}} device.

The only way the flow control signal would reach the other device is if the {{opposite}} device checked for a Carrier Detect (CD) signal (at pin 1 on a DE-9 cable and pin 8 on a DB-25 cable). As a result only specially designed software could make use of this partial handshaking. Software flow control still worked with this cable.|$|E
50|$|Short Interframe Space (SIFS), is {{the amount}} of time in microseconds {{required}} for a wireless interface to process a received frame and to respond with a response frame. It is the difference in time between the first symbol of the response frame in the air and the last symbol of the received frame in the air. A SIFS time consists of the delay in receiver RF, PLCP delay and the MAC processing delay, which depends on the physical layer used. In IEEE 802.11 networks, SIFS is the interframe spacing prior to transmission of an acknowledgment, a <b>Clear</b> <b>To</b> <b>Send</b> (CTS) frame, a block ack frame that is an immediate response to either a block ack request frame or an A-MPDU, the second or subsequent MPDU of a fragment burst, a station responding to any polling a by point coordination function and during contention free periods of point coordination function.|$|E

5000|$|The RS-232 {{standard}} {{defines the}} voltage levels {{that correspond to}} logical one and logical zero levels for the data transmission and the control signal lines. Valid signals are either {{in the range of}} +3 to +15 volts or the range −3 to −15 volts with respect to the [...] "Common Ground" [...] (GND) pin; consequently, the range between −3 to +3 volts is not a valid RS-232 level. For data transmission lines (TxD, RxD, and their secondary channel equivalents), logic one is defined as a negative voltage, the signal condition is called [...] "mark". Logic zero is positive and the signal condition is termed [...] "space". Control signals have the opposite polarity: the asserted or active state is positive voltage and the deasserted or inactive state is negative voltage. Examples of control lines include request to send (RTS), <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> (CTS), data terminal ready (DTR), and data set ready (DSR).|$|E
50|$|Although CSMA/CA {{has been}} used in a variety of wired {{communication}} systems, it is particularly beneficial in a wireless LAN due to a common problem of multiple stations being able to see the Access Point, but not each other. This is due to differences in transmit power, and receive sensitivity, as well as distance, and location with respect to the AP. This will cause a station to not be able to 'hear' another station's broadcast. This is the so-called 'hidden node', or 'hidden station' problem. Devices utilizing 802.11 based standards can enjoy the benefits of collision avoidance (RTS / CTS handshake, also Point coordination function), although they do not do so by default. By default they use a Carrier sensing mechanism called 'exponential backoff', or (Distributed coordination function) that relies upon a station attempting to 'listen' for another station's broadcast before sending. CA, or PCF relies upon the AP (or the 'receiver' for Ad hoc networks) granting a station the exclusive right to transmit for a given period of time after requesting it (Request to Send / <b>Clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>Send).</b>|$|E
50|$|In a {{wireless}} network many hosts or nodes are sharing a common medium. If nodes A and B are both wireless laptop computers communicating {{in an office}} environment their physical separation may require that they communicate through {{a wireless}} access point. But only one device can transmit {{at a time in}} order to avoid packet collisions. Prior to transmitting, Node A sends out a Ready to Send (RTS) signal. If it is not receiving any other traffic the access point will broadcast a <b>Clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>Send</b> (CTS) signal over the network. Node A will then begin transmitting while Node B knows to hold off transmitting its data for the time being. Even though it cannot directly communicate with Node A, i.e. Node A is hidden, it knows to wait based on its communication with the access point. An attacker can exploit this functionality by flooding the network with CTS messages. Then every node assumes there is a hidden node trying to transmit and will hold its own transmissions, resulting in a denial of service.|$|E
30|$|Take the IEEE 802.11 DCF [25] as an example. To {{address the}} hidden {{terminal}} problem, an RTS/CTS handshake protocol {{has been adopted}} and standardized. Basically, the RTS/CTS protocol requires a node <b>to</b> <b>send</b> an RTS first to the receiver, who will send back a CTS if it is <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> receive. It {{is not difficult to}} find that this RTS/CTS exchange can be slightly modified by including congestion information for hop-by-hop congestion control. Actually, this is just the basic idea behind the hop-by-hop congestion control discussed in [26].|$|R

2500|$|In the AFC, the Patriots {{defeated}} the Oakland Raiders 16–13 {{in the final}} game at Foxboro Stadium played in a driving New England snowstorm. The signature moment of the game was a controversial ruling by referee Walt Coleman {{in the fourth quarter}} that would cause this game to commonly be known as the [...] "tuck rule game." [...] While the Patriots possessed the ball, trailing the Raiders 13–10 with under two minutes left in regulation and no time outs, Brady was sacked by defensive back Charles Woodson, and appeared to fumble the ball. The fumble was recovered by Raiders linebacker Greg Biekert, presumably ending the game with a Raiders victory. After reviewing the play using instant replay, Coleman reversed the call on the field pursuant to the [...] "tuck rule", where a loose ball is ruled an incomplete pass if lost while [...] "tucking" [...] the ball. Most of the controversy centered on whether Brady was still trying to tuck the ball away when he lost control. Brady then led his team to the Raiders 27-yard line, where kicker Adam Vinatieri made a 45-yard field goal which barely <b>cleared</b> the crossbar <b>to</b> <b>send</b> the game into overtime. The Patriots won the toss in overtime and would win on another Vinatieri field goal from 23 yards. Oakland's offense never regained possession.|$|R
