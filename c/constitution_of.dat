5|$|The <b>Constitution</b> <b>of</b> the Republic of Singapore Tribunal is {{an ad hoc}} {{tribunal}} {{established by}} Article 100 of the <b>Constitution</b> <b>of</b> the Republic of Singapore. Article 100 was introduced into the Constitution by the <b>Constitution</b> <b>of</b> the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 2) Act 1994, which was passed by Parliament on 25 August 1994 and assented to by President Ong Teng Cheong on 14 September 1994.

5|$|The Florida <b>Constitution</b> <b>of</b> 1838 {{provided}} that a governor be elected every four years, {{who was not}} allowed to serve consecutive terms. The secessionist <b>constitution</b> <b>of</b> 1861 would have reduced this to two years and removed the term limit, but the state fell to the Union before the first election under that constitution. The rejected <b>constitution</b> <b>of</b> 1865 and the ratified <b>constitution</b> <b>of</b> 1868 maintained the four-year term, though without the earlier term limit, which was reintroduced in the 1885 constitution. The current <b>constitution</b> <b>of</b> 1968 states that should the governor serve, or would have served had he not resigned, more than six years in two consecutive terms, he cannot be elected to the succeeding term. The start of a term was set in 1885 at the first Tuesday after the first Monday in the January following the election, where it has remained.|$|E

5|$|Under the Maryland <b>Constitution</b> <b>of</b> 1776, the Governor {{was chosen}} for one-year terms by both houses of the General Assembly. An 1838 {{constitutional}} amendment allowed voters to elect the Governor to three-year terms from one of three rotating gubernatorial districts: eastern, southern, and western. At each election, only voters from a single gubernatorial election district selected the Governor. The Maryland <b>Constitution</b> <b>of</b> 1851 lengthened the Governor's term of office from three to four years, which brought elections for Governor in line with elections for Federal offices that occur only in even years. Finally, the <b>Constitution</b> <b>of</b> 1864 eliminated the rotating gubernatorial election districts and, since the election of 1868, the Governor has been elected by all the voters of the state.|$|E
5|$|After {{debating whether}} {{abolition}} of slavery would best proceed gradually or at once, with compensation to loyal Union men or without, the Convention resolved to abolish slavery immediately without compensation on April 10, 1864.

Immediately on its proclamation, the <b>Constitution</b> <b>of</b> 1864 was enforceable only in areas under Union control, but it would serve as Virginia's fundamental law until the <b>Constitution</b> <b>of</b> 1870 went into force.|$|E
