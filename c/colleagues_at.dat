5|$|In 1948, Slotin's <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> Los Alamos and the University of Chicago {{initiated}} the Louis A. Slotin Memorial Fund for lectures on physics given by distinguished scientists such as Robert Oppenheimer and Nobel laureates Luis Walter Alvarez and Hans Bethe. The memorial fund lasted until 1962. In 2002, an asteroid discovered in 1995 was named 12423 Slotin in his honour.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 Stephan C. Schuster at Penn State University {{and colleagues}} {{published}} the first sequences {{of an environmental}} sample generated with high-throughput sequencing, in this case massively parallel pyrosequencing developed by 454 Life Sciences. Another early paper in this area appeared in 2006 by Robert Edwards, Forest Rohwer, and <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> San Diego State University.|$|E
5|$|Initially, various {{theories}} existed {{about the}} exact {{cause of the}} low platelets in HIT. Gradually, evidence accumulated on the exact underlying mechanism. In 1984-1986, John G. Kelton and <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> McMaster University Medical School developed the laboratory tests {{that could be used}} to confirm or exclude heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} famous pieces of {{scientific}} research performed at King's were the crucial contributions to the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA in 1953 by Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin, together with Raymond Gosling, Alex Stokes, Herbert Wilson and other <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> the Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics at King's.|$|E
5|$|To {{meet the}} need for a {{thorough}} revision of the taxonomy of the flowering plants (angiosperms), systematists formed the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG), resulting in a new classification published in 1998. The scheme was largely {{based on the work of}} Kåre Bremer and <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> Uppsala and Stockholm universities in the late 1970s, and became universally accessible on the internet in 1996.|$|E

5|$|Anticholinergics {{and surgery}} (lesioning of the corticospinal pathway {{or some of}} the basal ganglia structures) were the only {{treatments}} until the arrival of levodopa, which reduced their use dramatically. Levodopa was first synthesized in 1911 by Casimir Funk, but it received little attention until the mid 20th century. It entered clinical practice in 1967 and brought about a revolution in the management of PD. By the late 1980s deep brain stimulation introduced by Alim Louis Benabid and <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> Grenoble, France, emerged as a possible treatment.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} fire, Shea and his ASPO <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> Houston boarded a NASA plane to the Kennedy Space Center. They landed at about 1:00a.m., only five {{hours after the}} fire had broken out. At a meeting that morning with Robert Gilruth, George Mueller and George Low, Shea helped to {{determine}} the individuals who {{would be on the}} NASA review board looking into the causes of the fire. Additionally, he persuaded George Mueller, head of NASA's Office of Manned Space Flight, to allow him to act as Mueller's deputy in Florida, supervising the progress of the investigation.|$|E
5|$|Now {{free from}} threat of prosecution, Hergé {{continued}} {{to support his}} <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> Le Soir who were being charged as collaborators; six of them were sentenced to death, and others to lengthy prison sentences. Among those sentenced to death was Hergé's friend, Jamin, although his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. In May 1946, Hergé was issued a certificate of good citizenship, which became largely necessary to obtain employment in post-war Belgium. Celebrations were marred by his mother's death in April 1946; she was aged 60.|$|E

5|$|The Balgo {{community}} did {{not establish}} an art centre {{for more than}} ten years after their <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> Papunya, with artistic activities commencing when an adult education centre was opened in 1981. However once Warlayirti Artists was set up, the community went on to become one of Australia's most successful Indigenous art centres. Painting at the centre is a sociable, communal activity, and Susie Bootja Bootja would reguarlly collaborate with other painters, including her husband.|$|E
5|$|Cumings, and {{simultaneously}} the New Zealand neurologist Derek Denny-Brown, {{working in the}} United States, first reported effective treatment with metal chelator British anti-Lewisite in 1951. This treatment had to be injected but {{was one of the}} first therapies available in the field of neurology, a field that classically was able to observe and diagnose but had few treatments to offer. The first effective oral chelation agent, penicillamine, was discovered in 1956 by British neurologist John Walshe. In 1982, Walshe also introduced trientine, and was the first to develop tetrathiomolybdate for clinical use. Zinc acetate therapy initially made its appearance in the Netherlands, where physicians Schouwink and Hoogenraad used it in 1961 and in the 1970s, respectively, but it was further developed later by Brewer and <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> the University of Michigan.|$|E
5|$|David Hillis, one of DeLee's <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> the Chicago Lying-in Hospital, {{published}} a 1917 journal article about his {{invention of the}} fetoscope, {{also known as the}} head stethoscope. By 1922, DeLee {{published a}} report of a similar device. Though DeLee published his findings several years after Hillis, he claimed that he had been openly discussing his idea for the device over many years. The device became known as the DeLee-Hillis stethoscope. DeLee was also the inventor of a catheter used to suction an infant's airway; the DeLee suction trap is still used after the delivery of a baby. He was one of the earliest physicians to advocate for the lower segment cesarean section.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, Mya Breitbart, Forest Rohwer, {{and colleagues}} used {{environmental}} shotgun sequencing (see below) {{to show that}} 200 liters of seawater contains over 5000 different viruses. Subsequent studies showed {{that there are more}} than a thousand viral species in human stool and possibly a million different viruses per kilogram of marine sediment, including many bacteriophages. Essentially all of the viruses in these studies were new species. In 2004, Gene Tyson, Jill Banfield, and <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> the University of California, Berkeley and the Joint Genome Institute sequenced DNA extracted from an acid mine drainage system. This effort resulted in the complete, or nearly complete, genomes for a handful of bacteria and archaea that had previously resisted attempts to culture them.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{determined}} Yeates {{had spent}} the evening of 17 December 2010 with <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> the Bristol Ram pub on Park Street, leaving at around 8:00pm to begin the 30-minute walk home. She told friends and colleagues {{that she was not}} looking forward to spending the weekend alone as it would be her first in the flat without Reardon; she planned to spend her time baking in preparation for a party the couple would be throwing the following week, and shopping for Christmas. Yeates was seen on closed-circuit television (CCTV) at around 8:10pm leaving a Waitrose supermarket without purchasing anything. She phoned her best friend, Rebecca Scott, at 8:30pm to arrange a meeting on Christmas Eve. The last known footage of Yeates recorded her buying a pizza from a branch of Tesco Express at around 8:40pm. She had also bought two small bottles of cider at a nearby off-licence, Bargain Booze.|$|E
5|$|On 13 March 1995, {{a pair of}} legs, severed at the knees, {{was found}} in a plastic bag {{floating}} off Clifford Pier. Three days later, a pair of thighs and a torso were found in the same area, also in a plastic bag. Initially, Singapore police could only determine that the body parts belonged to a Caucasian, and they had a possible name after receiving a missing person report for Lowe from the South African High Commission. Vanessa Lowe filed the report because she was distressed that her husband, who used to make daily contact with his family when overseas, had not called home or returned to South Africa by 12 March. Lowe's <b>colleagues</b> <b>at</b> work also tried to determine his whereabouts through personal contacts in Singapore. On 1 April, she confirmed that the body parts were her husband's through visual identification. However, his arms and head were never found.|$|E
