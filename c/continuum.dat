Cantor believed the <b>continuum</b> hypothesis to be true and tried for many years to prove it, in vain. His inability to prove the <b>continuum</b> hypothesis caused him considerable anxiety.|$|E

5|$|The {{radiation}} {{amplified by}} hydroxyl masers is the radio <b>continuum</b> of its host. This <b>continuum</b> is primarily composed of synchrotron radiation produced by Type II supernovae. Amplification of this background is low, with amplification factors, or gains, {{ranging from a}} few percent to a few hundred percent, and sources with larger hyperfine ratios typically exhibiting larger gains. Sources with higher gains typically have narrower emission lines. This is expected if the pre-gain linewidths are all roughly the same, as line centers are amplified more than the wings, leading to line narrowing.|$|E
