Active solar thermal systems that use mains electricity to pump the fluid through the panels are called 'low carbon solar'.

Measurements of the temperature at various points on the heat <b>collector</b> <b>panel,</b> adjacent soil, inlet and outlet were continuously monitored and recorded.

A thermosyphon system, suitable for Mali, consists of one flat-plate <b>collector</b> <b>panel</b> 1. 35 m 2 in aperture area and a 150 lt hot water cylinder. No pump is required for this system as the hot water is transferred to storage because of the thermosyphon effect. The system is modelled and simulated with TRNSYS program for Bamako, Mali and the results show that 6, 648 MJ of energy can be provided per year and the solar contribution is 0. 96, i. e., 96 % of the needs for hot water for a 4 - 6 persons family are satisfied with solar energy. The financial characteristics of the system investigated give positive and very promising figures. By considering a rate for electricity equal to 0. 16 US$/kWh, the pay back time is 2 years and the life cycle savings, representing the money saved because of the use of the system throughout its life (20 years) instead of using conventional energy (electricity), is US $ 2, 200.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the convective heat transfer, due to the action of the wind, from the upper surface of roof mounted flat plate solar collectors. The ability to predict the quantity of heat transferred from a collector, in this manner, is necessary in order to facilitate the evaluation of the overall efficiency of a <b>collector</b> <b>panel.</b> Previous methods of determining this convection coefficient have generally relied upon extrapolations of small scale wind tunnel results to full-scale values. The validity of these methods is questionable, and it was found that {{there was a lack of}} full-scale data relating to the convection coefficient from the upper surface of a flat-plate collector. It was also found that no systematic attempt to relate model results to full scale values had been made. Full-scale experiments have been performed to evaluate the convective heat transfer coefficient, h, from the upper surface of a roof mounted flat plate. The convection coefficient was found to be dependent upon the wind speed as measured above the roof ridge line, V 6 R, and to some extent upon the direction of the prevailing wind, G. Relationships between h and V 6 R are presented, as are relationships between h and VH (the wind speed measured at the mid-panel height) and h and V 10 (the meteorological 10 m wind speed). Small scale wind tunnel experiments were also performed. This was in order to assess the potential of using wind tunnel model results to predict accurately full-scale convective heat losses. These experiments showed some qualitative agreement with the full-scale tests. However, extrapolation of these model results to full-scale values rendered heat transfer coefficients in excess of those found in the full-scale work. Therefore the use of previously derived full-scale results from wind tunnel studies must be treated with caution. It is suggested that the full-scale results, presented here, represent a more satisfactory means of evaluating the convective heat transfer from the upper surface of roof mounted flat plate solar collectors...|$|E

40|$|The European Union has {{an ongoing}} {{commitment}} to reducing CO 2 emission as highlighted by its agreement at the Kyoto Summit. One approach to achieving these reductions {{would be to}} develop alternative energy sources for major energy demanding sectors. In the EU, about 40 % of all energy consumed is associated with buildings and of this, about 60 % is utilised in the housing sector. A {{major part of the}} energy demand of buildings could be met by utilising renewable energy sources, e. g. solar energy. Existing large-scale plants for power generation prevent efficient utilisation of the waste hot water produced. This means that to meet electricity demand, vast quantities of fossil fuels are burnt releasing unwanted pollutants (e. g., CO 2 and NOx) into the atmosphere. Over the last decade, small-scale CHP plants have been introduced for many applications with proven environmental and economic benefits. In addition, solar energy has been used to generate electricity and provide hot water in conjunction with the CHP plants. Investigation of a hybrid heat pipe solar collector/CHP system was carried out in this research. The system is powered by solar and gas energy as well as the boiler waste heat to provide electricity and heating for residential buildings. Compared to the relevant system configurations, this system has the following innovative features: The solar collector was integrated with exhaust flue gas channels that allowed both solar energy and waste heat from exhaust gas to be utilised. Heat pipes as high efficiency heat transfer devices were incorporated in the <b>collector</b> <b>panel.</b> Both miniature and normal heat pipes were investigated, and this resulted in two types of collectors, e. g., thin membrane heat pipe solar collector, and hybrid heat pipe solar collector, to be produced for this application. A compact, lightweight turbine was applied in this system. Novel refrigerants, including n-pentane and hydrofluoroethers (HFEs), were employed as the working fluids for the CHP system. Use of the system would save primary energy of approximately 3, 150 kWh per year compared to the conventional electricity and heating supply systems, and this would result in reduction of CO 2 emission of up to 1. 5 tonnes. The running cost of the proposed system would also be lower. The research initially investigated the thermal performance of several heat pipes, including micro/miniature heat pipes, normal circular and rectangular heat pipes, with/without wicks. An analytical model was developed to evaluate the heat transport capacity for these heat pipes. A miniature heat pipe with parallel piped channel geometry was proposed. The variation of heat transport capacity for either micro/miniature or normal heat pipes with operation temperature, liquid fill level, inclination and channel geometry were investigated. Investigation of the operating characteristics of the selected heat pipes, e. g., two miniature and one mini heat pipes, and two normal heat pipes, was then carried out using both the numerical technique and experimental testing. It was found that the results from tests were in good agreement with the numerical predictions when the test conditions were close to the simulation assumptions. The research work further involved the design, modelling, construction and tests of two innovative heat pipe solar collectors, namely, the thin membrane heat pipe solar collector and the hybrid heat pipe solar collector. A computer model was developed to analyse the heat transfer in the collectors. Two collector efficiencies, η and η 1, were defined to evaluate their thermal performance, which were all indicated as the function of a general parameter (tmean-ta) /In. Effects of the top cover, manifold as well as flue gas temperature and flow rate (for hybrid collector only) on collector efficiencies were investigated using the computer model developed. Laboratory tests were carried out to validate the modelling predictions and experimentally examine the thermal performance of the collectors. Comparison was made between the modelling and testing results, and the reasons for error formation were analysed. The research then considered the issues of the micro impulse-reaction turbine, which was another part of the integrated system. The structure configuration, coupling pattern with the generator as well as internal geometry contour of the turbine were described. The velocity, pressure and turbulent kinetic energy of the flow in the turbine were determined using numerical CFD prediction. In addition, experimental tests were carried out using a prototype system. The results of CFD simulation and testing show good agreement. This indicates that CFD {{can be used as a}} tool of optimizing turbine geometry and determining operating conditions. The research finally focused on the integrated system which brought the heat pipe solar collector, boiler and micro turbine together. The individual components, configurations and layout of the system were illustrated. Theoretical analysis was carried out to investigate thermodynamic cycle and heat transfer contained in the combined system, which is based on the assumption that the system operated on a typical Rankine cycle powered by both solar and gas energy. Tests for the prototype system was carried out to realistically evaluate its performance. Two types of turbine units were examined; one is an impulse-reaction turbine, and the other is a turbo-alternator. The turbo-alternator was found to be too small in capacity for this system thereby affecting its output significantly. The micro impulse reaction turbine was considered a better option. A typical testing showed that the majority of heat required for the turbine operation came from the boiler (7. 65 kW), and very little (0. 23 kW) from the solar collector. The gas consumption was 8. 5 kW. This operation resulted in an electricity output and domestic hot water generation, which were 1. 34 kW and 3. 66 kW respectively. The electrical efficiency was 16 % and the thermal efficiency was 43 %, resulting in an overall efficiency of 59 %. Increasing the number of the collectors used would result in reduced heat output from the boiler. This would help in improving system performance and increasing efficiencies. In this application, number of collectors used would be 4 as the flue gas flow rate would only be sufficient to provide 4 to 5 such collectors for heat recovery. The research resulted in the proposal of another system configuration. The innovative concept is illustrated in Chapter 8, and its key technical issues are discussed.

Photovoltaic panels are rated under standard conditions to determine the Wp rating (watts peak), which can then be used with insolation to determine the expected output, adjusted by factors such as tilt, tracking and shading (which can be included to create the installed Wp rating). Insolation values range from 800 to 950 kWh/(kWp·y) in Norway to up to 2,900 in Australia.|$|R
50|$|Currently, {{the only}} {{spacecraft}} {{to use a}} solar sail as the main method of propulsion is IKAROS which was launched by JAXA on May 21, 2010. It has since been successfully deployed, and shown to be producing acceleration as expected. Many ordinary spacecraft and satellites also use solar <b>collectors,</b> temperature-control <b>panels</b> and Sun shades as light sails, to make minor corrections to their attitude and orbit without using fuel. A few have even had small purpose-built solar sails for this use (for example Eurostar E3000 geostationary communications satellites built by EADS Astrium).|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} here aims {{to demonstrate the}} technical, architectural and energy viability of solar thermal collectors made with ceramic materials and the Mediterranean climate suitable {{for the production of}} domestic hot water (DHW) and for heating systems in buildings. The design of a ceramic shell formed by <b>panels</b> <b>collectors</b> and <b>panels</b> no sensors, which are part of the same building system that is capable of responding to the basic requirements of a building envelope and capture solar energy is proposed. Ceramics considerably reduced the final cost of the sensor system and offers the new system a variety of compositional and chromatic since, with reduced performance compared to a conventional metallic collector, can occupy the entire surface of front and get a high degree of architectural integration. A tool for assessing the new ceramic solar collector has been defined from a multi-criteria perspective: economic, environmental and social. The tool enables the comparison of the ceramic solar collector with solar collectors on the market under different climatic and demand conditions...|$|R
