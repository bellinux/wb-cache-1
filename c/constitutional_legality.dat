40|$|In Identity Captured by Law, Sébastien Grammond {{assesses the}} <b>constitutional</b> and {{international}} <b>legality</b> {{of rules that}} control membership in Indigenous societies and the official language minorities of Canada. Grammond’s main argument is that Indigenous and minority membership rules do not violate legal commitments to equality if there is sufficient correspondence between the legal criteria that determine membership and the actual criteria that group members themselves deploy to define themselves. Membership rules based on a racial conception of ethnic identity {{are less likely than}} those based on cultural or relational conceptions of ethnic identity to correspond to actual identities and therefore are more likely to violate equality rights. This argument requires a substantive as opposed to formal conception of equality, which Grammond develops and defends at some length. Comprehending equality in substantive terms means membership rules are not inherently discriminatory but instead that their <b>constitutional</b> and international <b>legality</b> rests {{on the extent to which}} they improve the situation of the group in question as opposed to simply oppressing or stereotyping individual members of the group...|$|R
2500|$|While the {{criminal}} behaviour of Vichy France was consistently acknowledged, {{this point of}} view denied any responsibility of the state of France, alleging that acts committed between 1940 and 1944 were unconstitutional acts devoid of legitimacy. The main proponent of this view was Charles de Gaulle himself, who insisted, as did other historians afterwards, on the unclear conditions of the June 1940 vote granting full powers to Pétain, which was refused by the minority of Vichy 80. In particular, coercive measures used by Pierre Laval have been denounced by those historians who hold that the vote did not, therefore, have <b>Constitutional</b> <b>legality</b> (...) [...] In later years, de Gaulle's position was reiterated by president Mitterrand. [...] "I will not apologize in the name of France. The Republic {{had nothing to do with}} this. I do not believe France is responsible," [...] he said in September 1994.|$|E
60|$|I {{have been}} told that we in England have {{occasionally}} fallen into the error of attributing to the Supreme Court at Washington a quasi political power which it does not possess. This court can give no opinion to any department of the government, nor can it decide upon or influence any subject that has not come before it as a regularly litigated case in law. Though especially founded by the Constitution, it has no peculiar power under the Constitution, and stands in no peculiar relation either to that or to acts of Congress. It has no other power to decide on the <b>constitutional</b> <b>legality</b> of an act of Congress or an act of a State legislature, or of a public officer, than every court, State and National, high and low, possesses and is bound to exercise. It is simply the national court of last appeal.|$|E

50|$|In this case, if the {{definition}} of rape were to be developed retrospectively it would offend the <b>constitutional</b> principle of <b>legality</b> as I have demonstrated above. On the other hand, {{if we were to}} accept that the principle of legality is a bar {{to the development of the}} common law, the Courts could never develop the common law of crimes at all. In my view, such a conclusion would undermine the principles of our Constitution which require the courts to ensure that the common law is infused with the spirit, purport and objects of the Constitution. The impasse can be avoided by accepting that in these circumstances it is appropriate to develop the law prospectively only.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the constitutional politics of international law, locating this {{as part of}} a wider debate over the nature of responsibility in conditions of uncertainty. Despite a general commitment to international legality operating in international society, international law’s claim to rule is limited by competing beliefs about the institutional practices generated and legitimated by this commitment. This thesis argues that there is a critical divide between “pragmatic” and “constitutionalist” ethics of legality. The account of legality developed here suggests that faith is itself a necessary and useful strategy for responding to social uncertainty and, {{to the extent that the}} institution of international law can generate this faith, a constitutional ethic cannot be dismissed as quickly or easily as pragmatists suppose. This claim is further developed through illustrating how this <b>constitutional</b> ethic of <b>legality</b> has begun to shape the politics surrounding the prohibition on torture, the governance of the global commons, the legitimacy of peacebuilding, and the regulation of the use of force...|$|R

Such a mode of proceeding is a consequence of the conception o f law which is adopted in our system. According to this conception the law itself determines what kinds of general legal acts can be admitted and, secondly, what organs are competent for to vote them.

Efforts {{have been made}} to explain this situation in other realities, regarding high budgetary, accounting and auditing content needed to carry out auditing activities constitutionally assigned to this kind of entities. Nevertheless, identifying competences of the General Comptroller of the Republic and its nature of autonomous constitutional body shapes an important expression of Constitutional State and the principle of powers division.

5000|$|The primary {{provisions}} of the interim Constitution regulating local government are contained in Chapter 10. To the extent, therefore, that a local government acts in breach {{of one of the}} direct and mandatory {{provisions of}} Chapter 10, it is clear that that infringement will be in breach of the Constitution and subject to constitutional challenge. Local government is also subject to Chapter 3 of the interim Constitution. It is also clear from Chapter 10 that the powers, functions and structures of local government provided for in the Constitution will be supplemented by powers, functions and structures provided for in other laws made by a competent authority. There is no doubt, the court held, that the common-law principles of ultra vires remain under the new constitutional order. However, they are underpinned (and supplemented where necessary) by a <b>constitutional</b> principle of <b>legality.</b> In relation to [...] "administrative action," [...] the principle of legality is enshrined in section 24(a) of the Constitution. In relation to legislation, and to executive acts that do not constitute [...] "administrative action," [...] the principle of legality is necessarily implicit in the Constitution. The question, therefore, of whether or not local governments act intra vires in imposing rates and levies, and paying subsidies, remains a constitutional question.|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} the constitutional limitations on requiring Icelandic pension funds {{to utilize the}} money deposited in them in a certain manner. The constitutionality {{of different kinds of}} state intervention on pension fund spending (permitting vs. requiring the pension funds to participate in schemes that either do or do not yield returns for the funds) will be examined. The examination will primarily be based on the Constitution’s article 76 on social rights, article 72 on property rights and unwritten <b>constitutional</b> requirements of <b>legality,</b> proportionality and equality in legislation. It turns out that art. 76 of the Icelandic Constitution carries little weight in this area. However, the protection of property entails that it is constitutionally untenable to either permit or require pension funds to participate in schemes or projects which do not yield a return. The unwritten constitutional principles also lead to the conclusion that some state intervention would be unconstitutional. The conclusion is that the statutory requirement that everyone participate in pension funds leads to considerable constitutional limitations on state intervention in pension fund spending.
