5|$|In June, Edge won the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship (the unified {{version of}} the World Tag Team Championship from the Raw brand and the WWE Tag Team Championship from the SmackDown brand) with Chris Jericho at The Bash after he and Jericho were {{inserted}} into what was originally a match between reigning champions The Colóns and Legacy. The win made Edge a record setting 12 time World Tag Team Champion. On July 3, Edge suffered a torn Achilles tendon while competing at a live event in San Diego in a match against Jeff Hardy, and later underwent surgery. It was reported that he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> of action {{for up to a}} year. During Edge's absence, Jericho replaced him with Big Show (forming Jeri-Show) and Jericho began to speak badly of Edge, mocking him for his injury.|$|E

For instance, suppose a ball that pitches {{in line with the}} stumps, hits the player on the pads in line with the stumps and would, if it had not hit the pads, have struck the stumps. The player <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> leg before wicket. However, if the ball ricochets off the pads onto the stumps, the batter would be given out bowled instead.|$|E
25|$|Royal Challengers Bangalore {{started their}} season with an unconvincing win against KKR at Kolkata, {{supported}} by a knock of 96 by Chris Gayle. But they lost their next three matches in Bengaluru to SRH, MI, and CSK. Two great bowling performances ensured RCB secured dominant wins against RR and DD, winning by 9 wickets and 10 wickets respectively. Their next match against RR got washed out after a strong batting performance from RCB. They lost a close match to CSK, but recovered by crushing Kings XI Punjab by 138 runs, {{supported by a}} century by Chris Gayle, and a four wicket haul for Sreenath Aravind and Mitchell Starc. Royal Challengers' good form continued when AB de Villiers and Virat Kohli smashed the highest T20 partnership ever (later beaten by the same pair in IPL 2016) against Mumbai Indians, to secure a good win. Later, RCB lost to Kings XI Punjab in a rain affected match, putting their playoff qualification in doubt. They faced SRH in the next match, again affected by rain. Amidst a lot of drama, and stunning performances from Virat Kohli and Gayle, RCB won an unlikely match in Hyderabad. Now, {{the only way they}} <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> of the playoffs became very unlikely, yet possible. RCB lost their chance to be placed second in the points table after rain washed out their final match against DD.|$|E

25|$|Since the MNF {{schedule}} {{is set in}} April and cannot be changed, the league and network cannot guarantee a late season matchup will have any significance or be highly anticipated. Teams thought to be good during the off-season <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> of playoff contention {{by the middle of}} the season; a prime example occurred in 1999, when the San Francisco 49ers and Atlanta Falcons both entered the season's final MNF game with 4–11 records. It had seemed like a good pre-season matchup since the Falcons had played in the previous season's Super Bowl and the 49ers coming into the 1999 season had posted 16 consecutive 10-win seasons. It is also possible for a team like the 1999 St. Louis Rams not to be scheduled for a Monday night game because of its dismal record the year before, and many other NFL teams (such as the 2004 San Diego Chargers, with zero primetime games) have had huge unforeseen turnarounds that result in lack of MNF attention (these teams generally receive multiple MNF spots the year after their breakout success, which is great for viewers if those teams continue to play well, and not so great if they return to mediocrity or worse). However, the forecasting abilities of the NFL's scheduling officials have exhibited uncanny proficiency. Many MNF games occurring later in the season feature at least one team that is either headed to the playoffs or must win the MNF game to clinch a playoff spot.|$|E

He stated that if work on the album {{could be done in}} June 2013, then it was hoped that the album <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> by the following September or October. After Hanneman's passing, Holt was asked if he will be featured on the album, to which he replied that he would probably be playing some solos on the album, but {{that the rest of the}} guitar work would all be King. King later confirmed this sentiment, but explained that Holt would not be participating in any of the writing, noting: [...] "fans aren't ready for it." ...|$|E

[...] Mor Stern was a religious man, but his son was less so. Late in life Solti recalled, [...] "I often upset him because I never stayed in the synagogue for longer than ten minutes." [...] Teréz Stern was from a musical family, and encouraged her daughter Lilly, eight years the elder of the children, to sing, and György to accompany her at the piano. Solti remembered, [...] "I made so many mistakes, but it was invaluable experience for an opera conductor. I learnt to swim with her." [...] He was not a diligent student of the piano: [...] "My mother kept telling me to practise, but what ten-year-old wants {{to play the piano}} when he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> playing football?" ...|$|E

500|$|U2 and McGuinness {{thought that}} too much money had been {{invested}} to abort the concert, and they sympathised with the fans who had travelled to the venue in the poor weather. Accordingly, they decided {{to proceed with the}} concert as planned. However, according to Ezratty, many of the crew were not in agreement and wanted to walk off the set. He said, [...] "The guys from the American sound company were not at all enamored with being out with this band. I can remember them saying, [...] "Oh, we <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> with Asia right now!' So they decided to pull the plug on it. They said, 'It's a matter of safety. We're going to pull the system down and we're not doing to do it.'" [...] McGuinness dissuaded the crew with an impromptu speech, a moment on which Ezratty recollected: [...] "Paul called everybody down into the bowels of Red Rocks where they fed everybody. It was cold and raining and everybody was shivering, and Paul made a speech, saying in no uncertain terms {{that we were going to}} proceed as one, that the band's entire livelihood was riding on this, and that this was one of the most pivotal moments in their career. He said that if it were deemed that this show was in any way possible to happen, it was going to happen, and it was not going to be tolerated that anybody would do anything but add their effort to a successful and positive outcome I just stood there and went, [...] "This is so cool. This is like a general rallying the troops.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Hampshire won the toss {{and elected}} to bat. There were 1,200 at the Rose Bowl to watch Simon Katich {{flawless}} 72 not out, {{as he was}} the only one able to cope with the conditions as Hampshire were all out for 197 before tea. Katich's innings was one of defence coupled with the odd drive, hook and pull. Hampshire's meagre total suggests they miss Kevin Pietersen, who performed so well for England in the one-dayers against Zimbabwe and South Africa over the winter. Pietersen said of his foot injury, [...] "If I got a ball on my foot or I slipped I <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> for six to eight weeks. It's a bit tender and it's just a case of biding my time", he said. However, they did have to face good, fast-medium-pace bowling from Gloucestershire. Gloucestershire fared well in reply, and Shane Warne brought himself into the attack after only 18 overs. He took Craig Spearman's wicket when Spearman tried to sweep him, but Gloucestershire were sitting pretty at close on 118 for 2, 79 behind with 8 first innings wickets remaining.|$|E
2500|$|Barakat {{said the}} writing process {{consisted}} of Gaskarth [...] "writing songs and us going into the studio to put in our two cents and changing a couple things around." [...] In an interview with Just So You Know, Gaskarth said the album title [...] "summarizes {{the theme of the}} songs, most of which centralize around escapism; running from my problems, burning bridges because of those problems; and the realization that its hard work to rebuild after those problems have torn people apart." [...] In an interview with MTV, Gaskarth said that the title was inspired [...] "by the subject matter on the record, where it's this toss-up of being wrapped up in what we do, and having the fun and the good times, and kind of pulling that blindfold down in order to ignore the fact that other problems are crumbling around you". Gaskarth also said [...] "one of the big things that came along with this album ... a lot of anxiety. About where were we going to go". Gaskarth said the band purposely sought to [...] "step outside of the box and do some things that were a bit scary." [...] He mentioned that [...] "there's one [...] that starts with classical guitar playing something that sounds like it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> of vaudeville and it's that kind of thing that we really decided to go for on this record." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dennis Lillee {{opened the}} Australian bowling {{with the help}} of the wind and was a yard faster than Willis, but Jeff Thomson bowling into the wind was faster still and made the opening batsmen Brian Luckhurst and Dennis Amiss flinch from the ball leaping off the pitch towards their bodies. Luckhurst edged a catch behind to Rod Marsh and Amiss to Terry Jenner in the gully and England were 10/2 just as Australia had been, with Thomson (3/59) {{receiving}} enthusiastic applause from his new home crowd. The England vice-captain John Edrich dug himself in and fought off the short-pitched deliveries which battered his body and hands. His captain Mike Denness padded up to a ball that landed outside his off-stump and cut back under the new leg before wicket law which meant he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> if the umpire was satisfied that the ball would hit the wicket even if it pitched outside the line of the stumps. Keith Fletcher was severely bruised on his forearm and fended off a couple of balls that landed just beyond the reach of Ian Redpath at short-leg. Thomson had now switched ends and with the wind behind him was bowling at extraordinary speed, Fletcher once edging the ball over the slips that almost went for six. After Doug Walters and Jenner had given him a rest Lillee (2/73) returned to bowl Fletcher, who cut the ball onto his stumps and England were 57/4. The Edrich family were well known for their tenacity and Tony Greig used his long reach to slash the short stuff over the head of the Australian slip and gully fieldsmen. As a result, they saw out the day with the score on 114/4. Strangely Ian Chappell did not ask for the wicket to be rolled at the start of the second day and neither did Denness at the start of the third. Edrich started the day making 2,000 runs against Australia, the seventh man to do so after Jack Hobbs, Wally Hammond, Herbert Sutcliffe, Len Hutton, Colin Cowdrey and Ken Barrington. Immediately afterwards Greig was dropped by Jenner off Lillee and Edrich, whose hand was so swollen from a bone broken on the previous day that he could barely hold his bat, edged Thomson to Ian Chappell at first slip for 48. Max Walker (4/73) was now bowling into the wind with the new ball and dismissed Alan Knott and Peter Lever, but [...] "Greig started slashing the ball all over the place on his way to a century and Underwood's nagging straight bat was defying everything we threw at him. Lillee, Thomson, Walker, Jenner...then through them all again." [...] Greig (110) and Derek Underwood (25) added 58 for the eighth wicket when Chappell called on Doug Walters to break the partnership. The ball slipped from Walters hand and wafted towards Underwood, who was so used to the pace of Lillee and Thomson that he mistimed his stroke and gave a simple catch to Redpath in the covers for 228/8. Greig hit his 17th boundary then gave a fine edge to Marsh from Lillee at 248/9, the first England batsmen to make a century in Brisbane since Maurice Leyland in 1936–37, also the last time England had won at the venue. Bob Willis and Mike Hendrick added 17 runs for the last wicket until the latter gave a catch to Redpath off Walker and England were out for 265, 44 runs behind Australia.|$|E
