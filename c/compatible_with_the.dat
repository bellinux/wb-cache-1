5|$|In 2009 Phil Senter {{published}} {{a study on}} dromaeosaurid toes and showed that their range of motion was <b>compatible</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> excavation of tough insect nests.

However, Senter did not test whether the strong curvature of dromaeosaurid claws was also conducive to such activities.|$|E
