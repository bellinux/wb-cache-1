40|$|Pasta, a {{traditional}} and highly popular cereal-based food, is produced with durum wheat semolina. It contains 13 % (db) of proteins, but is deficient in some amino acids. Protein enriched (17 %) pasta with better {{amino acid profile}} were produced using 35 % faba bean flour or 5 % egg white powder. The impact of pasta enrichment on the structuration of their protein network was studied from the macro to the supramolecular scales against two pasta controls: classical 100 % durum wheat pasta (13 % protein) and wheat gluten enriched pasta (17 % protein). Pasta is traditionally obtained after kneading, extruding and drying steps. Different temperature barrels {{can be used in}} industry. The effect of such drying temperature on the protein network structuration was studied using low (55 °C) or very high temperature (90 °C) on all enriched and control pasta. Changes in dried and <b>cooked</b> <b>pasta</b> structure were monitored by rheological, microscopic, SE-HPLC and FTIR methods and linked to in vitro protein digestibility of <b>cooked</b> <b>pasta</b> Different structural changes were detected in pasta especially at the macroscopic and supramolecular scales, related {{to the nature of the}} protein source used for the enrichment. The gluten and egg white enriched pasta presented a strengthened structure due to their high covalently linked protein network, unlike faba bean enriched pasta which presented a weakly bounded protein network. This variability in pasta matrix structure may impact the protein digestibility of <b>cooked</b> <b>pasta.</b> Protein conformation (β-sheet and β-turns) was highly related to the amino acid content of the raw mater used for enrichment. Rising temperature induced a fortification of pasta structure, notably for gluten and egg pasta, by increasing the level of covalently bounded proteins and induced a higher β-sheet proportion, while decreasing α-helix structures in dried pasta. Despite these structural high temperature-induced changes, no effect on protein digestion after cooking pasta was observed...|$|R

40|$|Pasta is {{a product}} with a long history, but is also still being {{developed}} today. Producers want to use new raw materials to make pasta more nutritious, less allergenic, and less dependent on durum wheat. All have in common that new raw materials shall not compromise the desired texture properties of <b>cooked</b> <b>pasta</b> such as the “al dente” feeling. To facilitate {{the development of new}} pasta products, understanding the microstructure of pasta can be a tool. Water transforms and interacts with the microstructure during cooking and the outcome determines the texture. The main objective of this work was to analyse the interplay of microstructure and water, and how this is affected by the choice of raw materials. We combined light microscopy and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study the microstructure and water distribution of pasta. We improved the resolution of MRI to yield data in 3 D and were able to link MRI data to microstructure components such as fibre particles and the extent of starch gelatinisation. Monitoring microstructure transformations during cooking and warm-holding of pasta revealed that some transformations are not dependent on the raw materials used. Water ingress towards the core is regulated by starch gelatinisation, which holds true both during cooking and warm-holding. The extent of the continuous starch and protein transformation from core to surface in <b>cooked</b> <b>pasta</b> is mainly governed by the product geometry. Also, texture changes during warm-holding depended mainly on the amount of available water within and around the pasta after cooking. Nevertheless, raw materials are of importance: A higher protein content limited the degree of starch swelling within the gelatinised region in <b>cooked</b> <b>pasta.</b> Fibre particles can hinder water migration locally due to their perpendicular alignment against the direction of water ingress. Bran particles in particular do not absorb water during cooking, but redistribute it around the particles and create a strong variation in the degree of starch swelling. The severity of this effect correlated with bran particle size. This thesis provides a comprehensive overview over how local microstructure and raw material choice affect water distribution at different scales in the cooked product. </p...|$|R
40|$|Granule-bound starch synthase, {{also known}} as the waxy protein catalyses the {{synthesis}} of amylose in wheat endosperm starch. In durum wheats, the genes encoding GBSS are present at the two Wx loci on chromosome 7 A and 4 A (a segment of 7 B that has been translocated). Several null Wx-B 1 (missing GBSS protein from chromosome 4 A) durum lines were produced from crosses with null- 4 A bread wheats backcrossed to durum wheats. Semolina milled from 4 normal and 7 null- 4 A durum wheat lines grown over two seasons (1999 and 2000) in South Australia were analysed for amylose content, starch pasting properties as measured by the Rapid Viscoanalyzer (RVA), swelling power and starch damage, protein content and electrophoretic protein analysis. Spaghetti was prepared with a micro-scale extruder and the <b>cooked</b> <b>pasta</b> evaluated for cooking loss, firmness, stickiness and water absorption. The null- 4 A lines had significantly lower (ca. 5 %) amylose content, higher starch peak viscosities and semolina swelling power. The pasta derived from the null- 4 A lines had lower cooking loss and in 1999 was more adhesive than the non-waxy lines. Cooking loss was correlated with amylose content, peak starch viscosity, swelling power of semolina and <b>cooked</b> <b>pasta</b> adhesiveness. Semolina swelling power was highly correlated with RVA peak viscosity. Waxy durum wheats appear to have an advantage over the normal types in terms of lower cooking loss, widely used as an indicator of pasta cooking quality. [URL]...|$|R

These flours were used as ingredients to produce pasta products in a proportion of 5 %, 8 % and 10 %. The supplemented pasta products had shorter cooking time and higher water absorption, cooking and protein losses in water than had control pasta (100 % semolina). From sensory evaluation, fortified pasta generally had acceptability similar to control <b>pasta.</b> <b>Cooked</b> <b>pasta</b> with the highest level of substitution (semolina:germinated pigeon pea flour at 10 %) was chemically and biologically evaluated and results showed that protein, fat, dietary fibre and mineral contents were improved.

40|$|Abstract: Hard {{wheat flour}} and durum of {{different}} extraction level (whole meal, 82 % and 72 %) and their pasta products {{were evaluated by}} the ordinary methods in parallel with FT-IR spectroscopy. Chemically, there was considerable difference between hard wheat flour and durum in protein and crude fiber contents. Durum whole meal, hard wheat flour (72 %) and durum adulterated with hard wheat flour 72 % (1 : 1) were used to prepare high quality pasta and adulterated pasta, respectively. Color analysis showed that, addition of hard wheat to durum increased the lightness values but decreased the redness and yellowness values. Also, pasta processed from these raw materials had the same character except lightness. <b>Cooked</b> <b>pasta</b> had {{no significant differences in}} lightness and redness values while there were significant differences in yellowness values of the <b>cooked</b> <b>pasta.</b> Sensory evaluation of pasta made from durum and hard wheat and their mixture showed that, there were significant differences between them in all sensory properties. Cooking quality of pasta revealed that, the weight of hard wheat pasta increased more than durum pasta, while, the volume of durum pasta was higher than hard wheat pasta. Cooking loss was very lower in durum pasta than hard wheat pasta. Since, wheat and their products contain different polar functional groups such as lipids, carbohydrates and proteins, FT-IR spectroscopy was used as a beneficial tool for detecting adulteration of pasta. The FT-IR results showed that hard wheat (72 %) was recognized from durum (72 %) by presence of two specific bands at 1420 and 1375 cm- 1 which are nearly disappeared in durum, while durum was characterized by tw...|$|R
