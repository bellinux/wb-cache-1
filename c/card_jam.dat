5000|$|A {{command line}} [...] "C rm1.rdr" [...] {{was meant to}} cancel rather than submit the current deck of cards being read. This might have been of use if a <b>card</b> <b>jam</b> made it more {{sensible}} to let other jobs go ahead while one or more cards were replaced at a nearby keypunch.|$|E
50|$|A {{peripheral}} first {{offered on}} the Model 20 is the IBM 2560 Multi-Function Card Machine (MFCM). Because of its reliability problems, often involving <b>card</b> <b>jams,</b> the acronym was frequently interpreted as referring to many less favorable names. Nevertheless, the 2560 combines {{the functions of}} a card reader, card punch, interpreter, and card sorter, allowing the Model 20 to replace several separate pieces of punched-card equipment.|$|R

25|$|The General Ticketing Machines (GTMs) at each station which {{replaced}} the older ticketing machines, allow commuters to purchase additional credit {{to add to}} their EZ-Link cards or to purchase tickets for single trips. Fares for these single trip tickets are higher than those for EZ-Link cards. In addition, a S$1.00 refundable ticket deposit is charged for each Standard Ticket. This refund can be collected from any General Ticketing Machine {{so as long as}} the card is returned to the machine within 30 days of purchase. The card can also be deposited into a charity collection box, with the S$1 deposit going to charity. The rationale behind such a refundable deposit feature was that the smartcard technology contained within each Standard Ticket makes each one costly enough to necessitate the recycling of Standard Tickets. Since November 2007, external readers were installed on GTMs at stations operated by SMRT Corporation to address problems of <b>card</b> <b>jamming</b> in insert slots. The slots, however, remain in use for the purpose of refunding Standard Ticket deposits.|$|R
