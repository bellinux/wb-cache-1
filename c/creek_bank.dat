25|$|However, the marsh’s natural {{ability to}} buffer against erosion and {{flooding}} {{may be reduced}} by <b>creek</b> <b>bank</b> die-off. Since Spartina alterniflora is responsible for sediment binding and peat deposition (Redfield 1965), cordgrass die-off may compromise the ability of salt marshes {{to keep pace with}} sea-level rise. Also, the concentration of Sesarma burrows in New England salt marsh peat may directly trigger the erosion and collapse of the peat foundation of marshes.|$|E
25|$|The Ohlone {{people were}} the {{original}} inhabitants of Adobe Creek. A large shell mound which {{once had a}} group of Indian huts was found near Adobe Creek in Palo Alto. Evidence of a smaller settlement within Los Altos was uncovered in 1971, when an Ohlone burial ground with skeletons—one with ceremonial beads—was uncovered by new construction along Adobe Creek near O'Keefe Lane. The site had other artifacts, and an archeological dig was mounted by Foothill College. Around this same time, an Ohlone basket was discovered buried in the <b>Creek</b> <b>bank</b> further north.

25|$|In New England, {{predator}} depletion {{has triggered}} extensive marsh die-off salt marsh <b>creek</b> <b>banks.</b> Herbivory has already impacted up to 90% of <b>creek</b> <b>banks</b> {{in more than}} 70% of outer Cape Cod marshes. Absent in 1997, die-off has recently spread into Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, impacting over 85% of <b>creek</b> <b>banks.</b> The nocturnal purple marsh crab, Sesarma reticulatum, is playing {{a major role in}} this die-off through increased burrowing and herbivory due to release from predation pressure. Evidence has pointed to top-down control caused by human disturbances as the primary agent driving die-off.|$|R

25|$|The salt marshes of Cape Cod, Massachusetts (U.S.A), are {{experiencing}} <b>creek</b> <b>bank</b> die-offs of Spartina spp. (cordgrass) {{that has been}} attributed to herbivory by the crab Sesarma reticulatum. At 12 surveyed Cape Cod salt marsh sites, 10% - 90% of creek banks experienced die-off of cordgrass in association with a highly denuded substrate and high density of crab burrows. Populations of Sesarma reticulatum are increasing, possibly {{as a result of the}} degradation of the coastal food web in the region. The bare areas left by the intense grazing of cordgrass by Sesarma reticulatum at Cape Cod are suitable for occupation by another burrowing crab, Uca pugnax, which are not known to consume live macrophytes. The intense bioturbation of salt marsh sediments from this crab's burrowing activity has been shown to dramatically reduce the success of Spartina alterniflora and Suaeda maritima seed germination and established seedling survival, either by burial or exposure of seeds, or uprooting or burial of established seedlings. However, bioturbation by crabs may also have a positive effect. In New Zealand, the tunnelling mud crab Helice crassa has been given the stately name of an 'ecosystem engineer' for its ability to construct new habitats and alter the access of nutrients to other species. Their burrows provide an avenue for the transport of dissolved oxygen in the burrow water through the oxic sediment of the burrow walls and into the surrounding anoxic sediment, which creates the perfect habitat for special nitrogen cycling bacteria. These nitrate reducing (denitrifying) bacteria quickly consume the dissolved oxygen entering into the burrow walls to create the oxic mud layer that is thinner than that at the mud surface. This allows a more direct diffusion path for the export of nitrogen (in the form of gaseous nitrogen (N2)) into the flushing tidal water.|$|E
