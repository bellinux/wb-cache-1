The experimental results demonstrated that the magnet field could obviously increase the discharge current and enhance the particle agglomeration in <b>corona</b> <b>discharges.</b> The deflection of free electrons between the discharge and collection electrodes was measured. Therefore we can deduce that both the energy of free electrons and the concentration of free electrons and ions are increased in the magnet enhancement <b>corona</b> <b>discharges.</b> Comparing with the uniform magnet field, the uneven magnet field formed by the permanent magnet nearby the discharge electrodes can more effectively intensify <b>corona</b> <b>discharges.</b> We developed an aerosol charger of the magnet enhancement <b>corona</b> <b>discharges</b> with permanent magnet.

40|$|Charged {{species can}} be {{generated}} in air due to <b>corona</b> <b>discharges</b> from sharp electrodes. They are of great concern in practical applications due {{to their ability to}} drift in the electric field and to accumulate on dielectric surfaces modifying electric field distributions. To understand better regularities of dynamic behavior of charge carriers produced by corona, series of experiments have been conducted at ABB Corporate Research Center in Västerås, Sweden. For this, a coaxial large scale electrode arrangement was utilized. <b>Corona</b> <b>discharges</b> were initiated by applying triangular voltages that allowed for studying drift of ionic species under controlled conditions. The experimentally obtained data required physical interpretation and this was the main objective of the present MSc thesis work. In the thesis, a computer model of <b>corona</b> <b>discharges</b> in air is presented and its implementation in COMSOL Multiphysics is described. The developed model is utilized for simulations of <b>corona</b> <b>discharges</b> in the set-up used in the experiments.

25|$|Temperature and {{humidity}} play {{a large role}} in how much ozone is being produced using traditional generation methods (such as <b>corona</b> <b>discharge</b> and ultraviolet light).

25|$|The maximum {{potential}} {{is limited to}} about 35–40 kV, due to <b>corona</b> <b>discharge</b> dissipating the charge at higher potentials.

Low relative humidity increases the charge buildup; walking 20 feet (6.1 m) on vinyl floor at 15% relative humidity causes buildup of voltage up to 12 kilovolts, while at 80% humidity the voltage is only 1.5 kV.|$|E

It has a crystalline structure which forms layers which can be split (delaminated) into very thin sheets (0.125 to 0.025mm. or thinner), while remaining stable when exposed to electricity).

25|$|When {{the spark}} gap fires, the charged {{capacitor}} discharges into the primary winding, causing the primary circuit to oscillate. The oscillating primary current creates an oscillating magnetic field that couples to the secondary winding, transferring {{energy into the}} secondary side of the transformer and causing it to oscillate with the toroid capacitance to ground. Energy transfer occurs {{over a number of}} cycles, until most of the energy that was originally in the primary side is transferred to the secondary side. The greater the magnetic coupling between windings, the shorter the time required to complete the energy transfer. As energy builds within the oscillating secondary circuit, the amplitude of the toroid's RF voltage rapidly increases, and the air surrounding the toroid begins to undergo dielectric breakdown, forming a <b>corona</b> <b>discharge.</b>|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} that {{high-voltage}} <b>corona</b> <b>discharges</b> in atmospheric air have significant potential for bacterial inactivation. Neutral reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and ions {{generated by the}} <b>corona</b> <b>discharges</b> act upon the target liquid or solid surfaces and produce chemical or biological effects.

In this paper, the chemical (oxidation) effect of direct <b>corona</b> <b>discharges</b> (where ions act upon the target surface) and indirect <b>corona</b> <b>discharges</b> (where ions are screened by a grounded metallic mesh) in atmospheric air is studied by measuring the degree of decolorization of a blue dye dissolved in water.

25|$|In most EOG methods, the {{hydrogen}} gas {{will be removed}} to leave oxygen and ozone as the only reaction products. Therefore, EOG can achieve higher dissolution in water without other competing gases found in <b>corona</b> <b>discharge</b> method, such as nitrogen gases present in ambient air. This method of generation can achieve concentrations of 20–30% and is independent of air quality because water is used as the source material. Production of ozone electrolytically is typically unfavorable {{because of the high}} overpotential required to produce ozone as compared to oxygen. This is why ozone is not produced during typical water electrolysis. However, it is possible to increase the overpotential of oxygen by careful catalyst selection such that ozone is preferentially produced under electrolysis. Catalysts typically chosen for this approach are lead dioxide or boron-doped diamond.|$|E

40|$|An {{efficient}} algorithm without flux correction for simulation of <b>corona</b> <b>discharges</b> is proposed. The algorithm {{referred to as}} the position-state separation method (POSS) is used to solve convection-dominated continuity equations commonly present in <b>corona</b> <b>discharges</b> modelling. The proposed solution method combines an Eulerian scheme for the solution of the convective acceleration, the diffusion and the reaction subproblems, and a Lagrangian scheme for the solution of the linear convection subproblem. Several classical numerical experiments in different dimensions and coordinate systems are conducted to demonstrate the excellent performance of POSS regarding low computational cost, robustness, and high-resolution. It is shown that the time complexity of the method when dealing with the convection of charged particles increases linearly with the number of unknowns. For the simulation of <b>corona</b> <b>discharges</b> where local electric fields do not change strongly in time, the time step of POSS could be much larger than the CFL time step.

2500|$|UV ozone {{generators}} use ambient air for ozone production, no air prep systems are used (air dryer or oxygen concentrator), therefore these generators {{tend to be}} less expensive. [...] However UV {{ozone generators}} usually produce ozone with a concentration of about 0.5% or lower which limits the potential ozone production rate. Another disadvantage of this method is that it requires the ambient air (oxygen) to be exposed to the UV source for a longer amount of time, and any gas that is not exposed to the UV source will not be treated. This makes UV generators impractical for use in situations that deal with rapidly moving air or water streams (in-duct air sterilization, for example). Production of ozone is one of the potential dangers of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation. VUV ozone generators are used in swimming pool and spa applications ranging to millions of gallons of water. VUV ozone generators, unlike <b>corona</b> <b>discharge</b> generators, do not produce harmful nitrogen by-products and also unlike <b>corona</b> <b>discharge</b> systems, VUV ozone generators work extremely well in humid air environments. There is also not normally a need for expensive off-gas mechanisms, and no need for air driers or oxygen concentrators which require extra costs and maintenance.|$|E
