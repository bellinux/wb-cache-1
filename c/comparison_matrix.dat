Corel did port CorelDRAW 6.0 to the Macintosh in late 1996, {{but it was}} received as too little, too late. Designers tended to prefer Illustrator, Drawcord, or Free Hand based on which software they learned first. As an example, there are capabilities in Freehand still not available in Illustrator (higher scaling percentages, advanced find-and-replace feature, selective round-corner editing, export/print selected objects only, etc.).

40|$|Fuzzy {{set theory}} has been {{extensively}} incorporated in the original Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) with an aim to better represent human judgments in <b>comparison</b> <b>matrices.</b> One {{of the most popular}} technique in the domain of Fuzzy AHP is Fuzzy Extent Analysis method which utilizes the concept of extent analysis combined with degree of possibility to calculate weights from fuzzy <b>comparison</b> <b>matrices.</b> In original AHP, where the <b>comparison</b> <b>matrices</b> are composed of crisp numbers, Satty proposed that Eigen Vector of these <b>comparison</b> <b>matrices</b> estimate the required weights. In this research we perform a comparison analysis of these two approaches based on a data set of matrices with varying level of inconsistency. Furthermore, for the case of FEA, in addition to degree of possibility, we use centroid defuzzification and defuzzification by using the mid number of triangular fuzzy number to rank the final weights calculated from fuzzy <b>comparison</b> <b>matrices...</b>|$|R

40|$|Tests of {{consistency}} for the pair-wise comparison matrices {{have been studied}} extensively since AHP was introduced by Saaty in 1970 s. However, existing methods are either too complicated to be applied in the revising process of the inconsistent <b>comparison</b> <b>matrix</b> or are difficult to preserve most of the original comparison information due {{to the use of}} a new pair-wise <b>comparison</b> <b>matrix.</b> Those methods might work for AHP but not for ANP as the <b>comparison</b> <b>matrix</b> of ANP needs to be strictly consistent. To improve the consistency ratio, this paper proposes a simple method, which combines the theorem of matrix multiplication, vectors dot product, and the definition of consistent pair-wise <b>comparison</b> <b>matrix,</b> to identify the inconsistent elements. The correctness of the proposed method is proved mathematically. The experimental studies have also shown that the proposed method is accurate and efficient in decision maker's revising process to satisfy the consistency requirements of AHP/ANP.

40|$|Efficiency, {{the basic}} concept of multi-objective {{optimization}} is investigated {{for the class}} of pairwise comparison matrices. A weight vector is called efficient if no alternative weight vector exists such that every pairwise ratio of the latter’s components {{is at least as}} close to the corresponding element of the pairwise <b>comparison</b> <b>matrix</b> as the one of the former’s components is, and the latter’s approximation is strictly better in at least one position. A pairwise <b>comparison</b> <b>matrix</b> is called simple perturbed if it differs from a consistent pairwise <b>comparison</b> <b>matrix</b> in one element and its reciprocal. One of the classical weighting methods, the eigenvector method is analyzed. It is shown in the paper that the principal right eigenvector of a simple perturbed pairwise <b>comparison</b> <b>matrix</b> is efficient.

40|$|Pairwise <b>comparison</b> <b>matrix</b> as {{a crucial}} {{component}} of AHP, presents the prefer- ence relations among alternatives. However, in many cases, the pairwise <b>comparison</b> <b>matrix</b> is difficult to complete, which obstructs the subsequent operations of the clas- sical AHP. In this paper, based on DEMATEL which has ability to derive the total relation matrix from direct relation matrix, a new completion method for incomplete pairwise <b>comparison</b> <b>matrix</b> is proposed. The proposed method provides a new per- spective to estimate the missing values with explicit physical meaning. Besides, the proposed method has low computational cost. This promising method has a wide application in multi-criteria decision-making. Comment: 29 page...|$|E

In a sensory test we use a pick-the-winner ordinal scale to obtain the table of preferences for objects. In 1940 Kendall and Babington Smith proposed a consistency test for the preference table, using the number of circular triads in it. In this paper we show how to apply their test to a pairwise <b>comparison</b> <b>matrix</b> in the binary AHP and to one without a tie for up to nine items in the AHP. This is to test, using a pairwise <b>comparison</b> <b>matrix,</b> whether or not we can accept that items which are factors or alternatives are sufficiently ranked linearly before calculating weights of these items...|$|E
