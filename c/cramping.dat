40|$|Two {{hundred and}} {{eighteen}} subjects, out of 250 individuals {{taken from a}} general practice register, returned completed questionnaires giving details about rest <b>cramps,</b> and a further 15 were contacted by telephone. The overall prevalence of rest <b>cramps</b> in the survey population was 37 %. The symptom was more prevalent in older subjects. Rest <b>cramps</b> were most commonly experienced in {{the muscles of the}} leg, in 83 % of the 86 <b>cramp</b> sufferers. Symptoms were usually present at night (73 %).

40|$|The {{records of}} 2527 healthy {{children}} seen in an ambulatory care clinic were evaluated for nocturnal leg <b>cramps</b> {{in the preceding}} 12 months, frequency and duration of the <b>cramps,</b> whether the <b>cramps</b> affected one leg or both legs at a time, whether there was associated muscle <b>cramps</b> in feet, whether the <b>cramps</b> occurred when the child was awake or asleep, and whether there was residual tenderness in the affected muscles. Nocturnal leg <b>cramps</b> were present in 185 children for an overall incidence of 7. 3 %. Leg <b>cramps</b> were noted only in children aged > or = 8 years. The incidence increased at 12 years and peaked at 16 to 18 years of age. A majority (81. 6 %) of the affected children had nocturnal leg <b>cramps</b> 1 to 4 times per year. The mean duration of episodes was 1. 7 minutes. Leg <b>cramps</b> were unilateral in 98. 9 % of cases and the ipsilateral foot also was involved in 18. 9 % of cases. One hundred thirty-five (73 %) children had leg <b>cramps</b> while asleep, and the remaining 23 (12. 4 %) children had leg <b>cramps</b> in either state. Fifty-seven (30. 8 %) children had residual tenderness in the affected muscles. The mean duration of residual tenderness was 33. 2 minutes (range: 2 minutes- 1 day). We conclude that nocturnal leg <b>cramps</b> are common in children aged > 12 years. A majority of the affected children have leg <b>cramps</b> 1 to 4 times per year. The <b>cramps</b> are usually unilateral and occur when the children are asleep. Normal duration of the leg <b>cramp</b> is < 2 minutes.

The weakness is usually symmetrical; the limb muscles closer to the trunk (proximal) are predominantly affected, and weakness tends to start in the legs and spread to the arms. Muscles of the mouth and throat, eyes, and breathing are usually not affected, but occasionally weakness of the respiratory muscles can cause life-threatening respiratory failure. Attacks typically resolve within several hours to several days, even in the absence of treatment. On neurological examination during an attack, flaccid weakness of the limbs is noted; reflexes are usually diminished, but the sensory system is unaffected. Mental status is not affected.|$|E

Although it was possible to fit all these aircraft into the hangars, eight or nine were usually stored on the flight deck to reduce <b>cramping</b> below decks.|$|E
5|$|Tricholoma pardinum is one {{of several}} {{poisonous}} members of the genus Tricholoma; its large size, fleshy appearance, and pleasant smell and taste add to the risk of it being accidentally consumed. It was responsible for over 20 percent of cases of mushroom poisoning in Switzerland {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. Many cases of poisoning arise in the Jura Mountains. Eating it causes highly unpleasant gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, dizziness, vomiting, and diarrhea. These arise 15minutes to 2hours after consumption and often persist for several hours; complete recovery usually takes 4 to 6 days. Sweating and anxiety may be evident, and disturbance in liver function has been recorded. <b>Cramping</b> may occur in the calves. In one case, seven people and a cat suffered severe symptoms after sharing a meal that contained only two mushroom caps. The toxin, the identity of which is unknown, appears to cause a sudden inflammation of the mucous membranes lining the stomach and intestines.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To examine if {{different}} frequencies of electrical stimulation trigger different sized <b>cramps</b> in the abductor hallucis muscle and to analyze their surface electromyographic (EMG) behaviour in both time and frequency domains. METHODS: Fifteen subjects were studied. Stimulation trains of 150 pulses {{were applied to}} the muscle motor point. Frequency was increased (starting from 4 pps with 2 -pps steps) until a <b>cramp</b> developed. Current intensity was 30 % higher than that eliciting maximal M-waves. After the first <b>cramp</b> ("threshold cramp"), a 30 -minute rest was provided before a second <b>cramp</b> ("above-threshold cramp") was elicited with a frequency increased by 50 % with respect to that eliciting the first <b>cramp.</b> RESULTS: We found greater EMG amplitude and a compression of the power spectrum for above-threshold <b>cramps</b> with respect to threshold <b>cramps.</b> M-wave changes (ranging between small decreases of M-wave amplitude to complete M-wave disappearance) occurred and progressively increased throughout stimulation trains. Significant positive correlations were found between estimates of EMG amplitude during <b>cramps</b> and estimated reductions of M-wave amplitude. CONCLUSIONS: Varying frequencies of electrical stimulation triggered different sized <b>cramps.</b> Moreover, decreases in M-wave amplitude were observed during both threshold and above-threshold stimulations. The choice of the stimulation frequency has relevance for optimizing electrical stimulation protocols {{for the study of}} muscle <b>cramps</b> in both healthy and pathological subjects...|$|R
40|$|Neutrophils kill invading {{pathogens}} by AMPs, including cathelicidins, ROS, and NETs. The {{human pathogen}} Staphylococcus aureus exhibits enhanced resistance to neutrophil AMPs, including the murine cathelicidin <b>CRAMP,</b> in part, {{as a result}} of alanylation of teichoic acids by the dlt operon. In this study, we took advantage of the hypersusceptible phenotype of S. aureus DeltadltA against cationic AMPs to study the impact of the murine cathelicidin <b>CRAMP</b> on staphylococcal killing and to identify its key site of action in murine neutrophils. We demonstrate that <b>CRAMP</b> remained intracellular during PMN exudation from blood and was secreted upon PMA stimulation. We show first evidence that <b>CRAMP</b> was recruited to phagolysosomes in infected neutrophils and exhibited intracellular activity against S. aureus. Later in infection, neutrophils produced NETs, and immunofluorescence revealed association of <b>CRAMP</b> with S. aureus in NETs, which similarly killed S. aureus wt and DeltadltA, indicating that <b>CRAMP</b> activity was reduced when associated with NETs. Indeed, the presence of DNA reduced the antimicrobial activity of <b>CRAMP,</b> and <b>CRAMP</b> localization in response to S. aureus was independent of the NADPH oxidase, whereas killing was partially dependent on a functional NADPH oxidase. Our study indicates that neutrophils use <b>CRAMP</b> in a timed and locally coordinated manner in defense against S. aureus...|$|R

Methods: Throughout Australia, 81 children aged 2 – 16 years with CMT 1 A were recruited. Measures of strength, ankle range, foot posture, balance, agility, endurance, gait, and neurophysiology were collected. Post hoc logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of calf <b>cramp.</b> Results: Of the 81 children, 26 (32 %) reported calf <b>cramp,</b> and 1 child each reported toe, quadriceps, or arm <b>cramp.</b> Calf <b>cramp</b> was associated (p < 0. 05) with older age; the presence of hand tremor; stronger foot inversion, eversion, dorsiflexion, and plantarflexion; and better performance in long-jump and 9 -hole peg tests.

40|$|Background: Muscle <b>cramps</b> {{are common}} {{complains}} during pregnancy muscle <b>cramps</b> occur mostly during nights causing sleep disorder. The causes of muscle <b>cramps</b> are unknown. One probable cause {{could be the}} imbalance between intake and excretion of serum electrolyte such as calcium. Methods: The method used {{for the present study}} was double blind clinical trial. The study was conducted on 60 pregnant women suffering from leg muscle <b>cramps</b> who sought medical treatment in three selected clinics in Bushehr from April 2006 to November 2007. All subjects being third trimester of pregnancy, single pregnant, only used iron and multivitamins. Irregular use of medication, PLP (Preterm Labor Pain), disability completion forms excluded of study. Simple and accessible sampling was used in this study. Selection of study group and placebo were random. Visual analog forms were used to record the number and intensity of muscle <b>cramps.</b> These forms had provisions for 7 days of pretreatment and 28 days of treatments. At {{the end of the first}} week, the subjects were prescribed to take medications every night for four weeks. The subjects were asked to record the intensity of their muscle <b>cramps</b> on the visual analog forms during these four weeks. Results: The number and intensity of muscle <b>cramps</b> were considered in this study. The results of the study showed no significant change in intensity in the two groups. However, there was a significant reduction in the number of <b>cramps</b> in the study group after taking calcium (p=< 0. 02 < 0. 05). Conclusion: Taking calcium resulted in a significant reduction in the number of <b>cramps</b> in this study compared to placebo group.
