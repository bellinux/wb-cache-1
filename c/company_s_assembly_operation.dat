40|$|<b>Assembly</b> <b>operations</b> {{are a key}} {{component}} of modern manufacturing systems. Designing, planning, and conducting <b>assembly</b> <b>operations</b> represent {{an important part of the}} cost of a product. Virtual reality provides an efficient and cost-effective solution to manufacturing design, planning, and prototyping. Still there are certain issues (such as data translation, integration of various hardware and software systems, and real-time collision detection) faced while applying this advanced technology to the assembly domain. For example, existing works focus on using virtual reality systems and environments mainly to design new products and to plan for assembly. Little focus has been given to develop virtual reality environments that contribute to train operators on <b>assembly</b> <b>operations</b> and to bridge the gap between design and implementation/execution of assembly. Therefore, the research work presented in this article focuses on developing a fully functional virtual manufacturing assembly simulation system that solves the issues related to virtual reality environments. The proposed system uses a virtual environment to create an interactive workbench that can be used for evaluating assembly decisions and training <b>assembly</b> <b>operations.</b> It is a comprehensive system that provides visual, auditory, tactile, as well as force feedback.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a knowledge-based method for identifying infeasible <b>assembly</b> <b>operations</b> {{in the context}} of assembly sequence planning.

This capability increases the usefulness of assembly sequence planners as concurrent engineering tools by contributing to a closer integration between product design and assembly sequence planning. In the identification of infeasible <b>assembly</b> <b>operations</b> the concept of minimal infeasible sets of connections is introduced and two issues are addressed: the knowledge-based generation of these minimal sets, and their suitability to form a basis for a concise explanation of the causes of <b>assembly</b> <b>operation</b> infeasibility.

This system allows the initial description of the assembly to be in terms of the desired effects on the parts being assembled.

To generate a realizable assembly plan, both macro planning and micro planning problems need to be solved. Tooling considerations are an important component of the micro planning problem. Therefore, we present a methodology for modeling assembly tools, selecting tools for <b>assembly</b> <b>operations,</b> and generating detailed tool movements.

Using a high-throughput RNA structure probing method, we provide nucleotide resolution insights into rRNA structural rearrangements during nucleolar 60 <b>S</b> <b>assembly.</b> Our results suggest that many rRNA-folding steps, such as folding of 5. 8 S rRNA, occur at a very specific stage of assembly, and propose that downstream nuclear assembly events can only continue once 5. 8 S folding has been completed. Our maps of nucleotide flexibility enable making predictions about the establishment of protein-rRNA interactions, providing intriguing insights into the temporal order of protein-rRNA as well as long-range inter-domain rRNA interactions. These data argue that many distant domains in the rRNA can assemble simultaneously during early 60 <b>S</b> <b>assembly</b> and underscore the enormous complexity of 60 S synthesis. Ribosome biogenesis is a dynamic process that involves the ordered assembly of ribosomal proteins and numerous RNA structural rearrangements.
