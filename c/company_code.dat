30|$|Overall, {{there is}} {{empirical}} {{evidence that a}} code’s design matters for making ethical intention. A code which is clearly written and provides only a limited discretion has a statistically {{positive impact on the}} managers’ ethical intent (denoted as dLimited discretion w/o signature). This is also true for a code using pictures illustrating appropriate behavior (denoted as dPositive pictures) as well as a foreword by the top management emphasizing the importance to adhere to the <b>company’s</b> <b>code</b> and values (denoted as dBeliefs systems). All these findings are robust against modifications of the model and remain qualitatively unchanged when including relevant control variables. Contrary to our expectations, using examples in the code does not matter (denoted as dPositive/negative examples), {{the same is true for}} pictures showing inappropriate behavior (denoted as dNegative pictures) or a foreword by the top management emphasizing not to violate the <b>company’s</b> <b>code</b> (denoted as dBoundary systems). Thus, our second hypothesis is only partly supported, as only some modifications improve code effectiveness.|$|R
