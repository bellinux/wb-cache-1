40|$|There is an {{increasing}} amount of data in databases that is shared among many client computers. Some of this data may be relatively static. However, certain types of data may be changing frequently. Client applications {{may be interested in}} changes that are made <b>to</b> these data. <b>Notifications</b> of such changes allow a client to be made aware of changes that are made by another client application in a timely fashion. In this paper, I describe my work on exploring, designing, implementing and integrating of a notification mechanism in the CS-ECIS application developed at the company ChipSoft. To achieve this goal is the publish/subscribe technology, which is emerging as an appropriate comxnunicatioii paradigm for large-scale distributed systems, used. In the designed architecture. each client application defines and advertises <b>change</b> events <b>to</b> the <b>notification</b> service. The clients can subscribe to events of interest, and can refine their subscriptions through attributefilter expressions. A notification is sent whenever a database change, detected by the notification service, matches some active subscriptions. ...|$|R

40|$|Microtask {{crowdsourcing}} organizes complex {{work into}} workflows, decomposing large tasks into small, relatively independent microtasks. Applied to software development, this model might increase participation in {{open source software}} development by lowering the barriers to contribution and dramatically decrease time to market by increasing the parallelism in development work. To explore this idea, we have developed an approach to decomposing programming work into microtasks. Work is coordinated through tracking <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> a graph of artifacts, generating appropriate microtasks and propagating <b>change</b> <b>notifications</b> <b>to</b> artifacts with dependencies. We have implemented our approach in CrowdCode, a cloud IDE for crowd development. To evaluate the feasibility of microtask programming, we performed a small study and found that a small crowd of 12 workers was able to successfully write 480 lines of code and 61 unit tests in 14. 25 person-hours of time.

In the category [...] "Faculty resources," [...] even though few of us had significant changes in our faculty or student numbers, our class sizes, or our finances, the rankings' producers created a mad scramble in rank order ...data....

40|$|The public {{part of the}} {{vulnerability}} management cycle — publication-notificationpatch — is of interest to system administrators. We describe the architecture of {{the vulnerability}} notification Cassandra system 1. The timeliness of Cassandra notifications was evaluated by using the publication dates of CERT Incident Notes as approximations for the dates when vulnerabilities are widely exploited. We found that notifications sent by Cassandra in 2001 (until November) provided a forewarning of 60 days on average. However, these notifications were not always timely. An analysis of the vulnerability information flow identified sources of undesirable delays. A new Cassandra service, CVE Change Logs, was created <b>to</b> report daily <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> the CVE and bypass some sources of delays. Other efforts by MITRE mitigated other sources of delays and consolidated changes on their web site. An unexpected finding {{of this study is that}} the timing and the number of vulnerabilities involved in the method of disclosing vulnerabilities can contribute <b>to</b> <b>notification</b> delays caused by the limited processing capacity of intermediates and the finite patching capability of system administrators. We conclude that large batch processing of vulnerabilities contributes <b>to</b> <b>notification</b> and patching delays and is undesirable. For the same reasons, randomly timed disclosures of vulnerabilities should be undesirable, suggesting the creation of a focused mechanism for the disclosure of vulnerabilities. ...|$|R
