40|$|This article {{compares the}} land surface {{temperature}} (LST) and sky view factor (SVF) as {{indicator of the}} impact of urban morphology on the urban heat island effect. For this purpose, the work investigates the dependence of this relationship to spatial resolutions varying from coarse to very fine and related scaling effect. For this purpose, several daytime Landsat 8, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer and airborne TASI- 600 images acquired in different months of the year were used to retrieve LST. Moreover, a three-dimensional building vector database was used to produce SVF maps at different spatial resolutions, according to the thermal ones. The results show a positive relationship between LST and SVF; these trends are almost superimposable for same-sensor images, but vary for images at different resolutions. This is likely due to the interference on the SVF and LST values of micro-scale factors, e. g. thermal properties of building materials, anthropogenic heat, humidity and pollutants, and others, which in a macro-scale analysis are smoothed becoming irrelevant. Therefore, a digital database able to represent urban features at suitable spatial scale is a requirement for a reliable analysis. In particular, when airborne thermal data are used, the lack of a reliable <b>cartographic</b> <b>digital</b> <b>data</b> could represent a limiting factor. Specifically, the data set used in the computation of SVF and other geographical parameters involved in the LST assessment should be consistent with the resolution of airborne thermal data...|$|R

40|$|BeWeb – online ecclesiastical {{cultural}} heritage – {{is a project}} to establish a portal dedicated to the cultural and artistic heritage of the Catholic Church, by providing an integrated view of data regarding churches, the artwork and items of worship they contain, library and archive funds of diocesan and religious institutes, with a special focus on cultural, scientific and pastoral care aspects, {{in order to provide}} an authoritative tool for users to know more about these extraordinary assets. Our goal is to share the outcome of all activities carried out by dioceses and ecclesiastical cultural institutes to manage and enhance their cultural and artistic heritage, both through the catalogue – which provides a virtual map of buildings, items, cultural institutes, archives, funds and libraries – and also through content creation, by connecting different resources together and helping users find their way through this wealth of material, {{in order for them to}} appreciate aspects related to pastoral care and worship, in addition to history and culture. Integrating this kind of information leads to a clearer perception of the Church’s unique {{cultural heritage}}, which can be understood only by referring to local contexts that provide users with a fundamental key for interpretation. The digital inventory of ecclesiastical cultural and artistic heritage, that Italian dioceses have been urged to contribute to by the Italian Bishops’ Conference since 1997 – with the support of the National Office for Ecclesiastical Cultural Heritage (UNBCE) acting as coordinator – has led to the creation of a massive <b>digital</b> <b>data</b> <b>bank</b> in the last ten years. The inventory documents an extremely important, sizeable and peculiar cultural heritage, and testifies to the sense of responsibility and spirit of service of dioceses and religious institutes. UNBCE has laid down the methodology, identified strategies, provided means and support in the different work stages, but this project has been and still is a major networking effort, to which each diocese and institute contribute, safeguarding the added value that is given by the close union between information and heritage which, in several online projects, is sometimes undermined. The various inventory projects are the result of intense activity based on specific agreements signed with the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities and respective Central Institutes, to promote filing initiatives that comply with relevant national and international standards, safeguarding filing entities’ specifities. The traditionally active dialogue between UNBCE, Ministry officials and particular Churches has led to the pursuit of shared goals in implementing this ambitious project. Currently, BeWeb hosts the <b>data</b> <b>banks</b> of several Italian dioceses’ historic and artistic heritage, in addition to fact sheets regarding dioceses and cultural institutes (museums, archives and libraries). Over time, it will be enriched with <b>data</b> <b>banks</b> of architectural heritage, archival funds and library assets, thus becoming a cross-sectoral portal of ecclesiastical cultural heritage with and extraordinary potential. BeWeb engages in dialogue on a 360 ° radius: this project also includes continuous updates and reflections regarding national and international scenarios, through a semantic web, open data and integration with internationally-renowned archives such as VIAF, ULAN, TGN. All this is also made possible by the development of access point control and standardization (authority files). BeWeb’s aim is to provide for different navigation needs: from average users looking for basic information to specialists engaging in more sophisticated searches.

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The American Proposed Standard for <b>Digital</b> <b>Cartographic</b> <b>Data</b> {{presents}} {{the new national}} exchange format which allows the transfer of spatial data among parties that may use different computer hardware and different operating system software. A translator program for {{the conversion of the}} AutoCAD DXf data structure to the Standard's output format has been developed to determine the problems connected with the writing of such a translator program.

40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>Data</b> Forensics is {{constantly}} under scrutiny to standardize processes. Previous researchers moved between various frameworks without presenting a firm platform or solution, addressing standardization. Only a few researchers referred to automated investigation processes. Established <b>data</b> <b>banks</b> do not exist. We investigate whether investigators use forensic frameworks in their investigations. We question if these frameworks are guiding {{the investigation and}} the feasibility of an automated investigation model. We also investigate if a prediction based on a global <b>digital</b> forensic <b>data</b> <b>bank</b> is possible. Investigation processes {{with regard to the}} readiness of automated investigation is also investigated. Problems encountered are primarily linked to privacy is a major concern. The lack or willingness to address privacy up front, place obstacles in the way of would be researchers. The term automated forensics and automated tools are misunderstood, some participants regard automation as automated software tools and address this as: “Forensic automation is already becoming a problem by giving untrained examiners {{a false sense of security}} when in reality, they are not conducting an examination at all” Investigations using software that reflects a click and drag scenario, does not promote an academic research platform. We suggests automated forensics to be the process of investigation where the investigator make use of previous data based on predictive analysis of <b>data</b> <b>bank</b> from previous <b>data</b> and make use of forensic software in a lesser part. We suggest changing the mindset from “automated software”, to “automated analysis” whereby investigators could sift through the first level of classification and determine sub levels of the investigation with optimal running of scripts, suitable for level comparison and prediction. (Beebe, 2009) suggests using an Intelligent Analytical Approach extending artificial intelligence and other intelligent search enabling successful retrieval, making use of algorithms. This supports our point of view as well; using a stronger reflection to a semantic vs. literal searching technique should set a base platform, substituting the traditional literal searches. This also fits well with our vision of having a structured, relational data structure in place thereby improving data indexing. This would ultimately present a match based on “fuzzy hashing” which require a complete paradigm shift. This shift would step away from the overwhelming traditional search patterns and move to prediction of similar cases. We suggest using predictive Markov models, analyzing data for predictive similarity in events. We will also move to a fuzzy re-classification of data models. Since each case differs substantially, a model built from a generic level to predictive sub levels is suggested. This research did not cover relational database creation and classification of variables, further research will be conducted. In other words, we form predictions, irrespective of the investigation model followed. Further research is required in classifying variables and groups. It is questionable whether forensic investigators would follow standardized procedures at all—considering they are following their own customized methods to date. This presents a problem for standardization and ultimately automation...|$|R
