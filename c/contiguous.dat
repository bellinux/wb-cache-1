5|$|BART is {{operated}} by the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District, formed in 1957. , it is being expanded to San Jose with the <b>contiguous</b> Warm Springs and Silicon Valley BART extensions.|$|E
5|$|Chadderton is <b>contiguous</b> {{with other}} {{settlements}} on all sides, including a shared boundary {{with the city}} of Manchester to the southwest.|$|E
5|$|Thailand's {{habitats}} are <b>contiguous</b> {{with those}} of neighbouring countries, so it has few endemic birds. The white-eyed river martin, known only from its single wintering site in Thailand, is probably extinct.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} Arizona was {{admitted}} to the Union on February 14, 1912, the last of the <b>contiguous</b> states to be admitted.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} of Giffnock is <b>contiguous</b> with Glasgow and forms part of Greater Glasgow, the United Kingdom's fifth largest conurbation.|$|E
5|$|A {{few major}} {{connections}} not served by Interstate Highways include US6 from Hartford, Connecticut, to Providence, Rhode Island; US101 from Los Angeles to San Francisco; and US93 from Phoenix, Arizona to Las Vegas, Nevada. Three state capitals in the <b>contiguous</b> U.S. are served only by U.S. Routes: Dover, Delaware; Jefferson City, Missouri; and Pierre, South Dakota.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{found in}} the BWCAW include deer, moose, beaver, timber wolves, black bears, bobcats, bald eagles, {{peregrine}} falcons and loons. It is {{within the range of}} the largest population of wolves in the <b>contiguous</b> United States, as well as an unknown number of Canada lynx. It has also been identified by the American Bird Conservancy as a globally important bird habitat.|$|E
5|$|Central Pacific hurricanes {{are rare}} and on average 4 to 5 storms form or move {{in this area}} annually. As there are no large <b>contiguous</b> landmasses in the basin, direct hits and {{landfall}}s are rare; however, they occur occasionally, as with Hurricane Iniki in 1992, which made landfall on Hawaii, and Hurricane Ioke in 2006, which made a direct hit on Johnston Atoll.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{owing to}} the greater {{presence}} of cold-blooded (ectothermic) reptiles in warmer climates, {{the states in the}} southern half of the United States have more commonly designated a state reptile. From the twenty-four of the <b>contiguous</b> states roughly south of the Mason–Dixon line, only five lack a state reptile. From east to west, they are Delaware, Virginia, Kentucky, Arkansas, and Utah.|$|E
5|$|The Chesapeake Bay {{separates}} the <b>contiguous</b> {{portion of the}} Commonwealth from the two-county peninsula of Virginia's Eastern Shore. The bay was formed from the drowned river valleys of the Susquehanna River and the James River. Many of Virginia's rivers flow into the Chesapeake Bay, including the Potomac, Rappahannock, York, and James, which create three peninsulas in the bay.|$|E
5|$|The Storm Prediction Center issues {{convective}} outlooks (AC), {{consisting of}} categorical and probabilistic forecasts describing the general threat of severe convective storms over the <b>contiguous</b> United States {{for the next}} six to 192 hours (Day 1 through Day 8). These outlooks are labeled and issued by day, and are issued up to five times per day.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss plateau, {{within the}} natural {{borders of the}} Alps to the South and East, Lake Geneva and the Rhône {{to the west and}} the Rhine to the north, was {{recognized}} as a <b>contiguous</b> territory by Julius Caesar.|$|E
5|$|The {{agency is}} also {{responsible}} for forecasting fire weather (indicating conditions that are favorable for wildfires) in the <b>contiguous</b> U.S., issuing fire weather outlooks for Days1, 2, and 3–8, which detail areas with various levels of risk for fire conditions.|$|E
5|$|The list of highest {{points in}} each state is {{important}} to the sport of highpointing, where enthusiasts attempt to visit the highest point in each of the <b>contiguous</b> forty-eight states or in all fifty states. As of 2006, 155 people had reached all fifty state highpoints. Roughly 200–300 people attend the Highpointers Club convention each year.|$|E
5|$|A focal {{mechanism}} {{solution of}} the earthquake confirmed two nodal planes both striking north-south and dipping approximately 45degrees {{to the east and}} to the west. This faulting suggests dip slip reverse motion, and to a horizontal east-west axis of confining stress. The rupture also occurred partially on the New Madrid Fault, responsible for the great New Madrid earthquakes in 1812, consisting of the most powerful earthquakes to hit the <b>contiguous</b> United States.|$|E
5|$|Canada {{occupies}} much of {{the continent}} of North America, sharing land borders with the <b>contiguous</b> United States to the south, and the US state of Alaska to the northwest. Canada stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west; to the north lies the Arctic Ocean. Greenland is to the northeast. By total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country in the world, after Russia. By land area alone, however, Canada ranks fourth, {{the difference being due}} to it having the world's largest proportion of fresh water lakes.|$|E
5|$|Crested and marbled newts {{are found}} in Eurasia, from Great Britain and the Iberian Peninsula {{in the west to}} West Siberia and the {{southern}} Caspian Sea region in the east, and reach north to central Fennoscandia. Overall, the species have <b>contiguous,</b> parapatric ranges; only the northern crested newt and the marbled newt occur sympatrically in western France, and the southern crested newt has a disjunct, allopatric distribution in Crimea, the Caucasus, and south of the Caspian Sea.|$|E
5|$|Drymoreomys albimaculatus {{appears to}} be a {{specialist}} of dense, moist, montane and premontane forest. It has been found in disturbed and secondary forests as well as in pristine forest, but probably needs <b>contiguous</b> forest to survive. Reproductive activity has been observed in females in June, November, and December and in males in December, suggesting that the species breeds year-round. Although some of its morphological traits, such as the very large pads, are suggestive of arboreal (tree-dwelling) habits, most specimens were collected in pitfall traps on the ground.|$|E
5|$|During the Fourth Aliyah (1924–1928), the Jezreel Valley {{was the top}} {{priority}} of the Jewish National Fund (JNF). The JNF wanted to settle the valley {{in order to establish}} a significant Jewish agricultural community in the arable valley, and to create a <b>contiguous</b> bloc of Jewish settlements in the valley, connecting Haifa with the already existing bloc of Jewish settlements between Afula and Beit She'an. In 1924 the JNF bought some 30,175 dunams of land from Arab villages next to Nahalal {{in the western part of}} the valley. On this land, Sarid, Ramat David, Gvat, Kfar Baruch and Mishmar HaEmek were established.|$|E
5|$|Fibonacci {{search is}} a method similar to binary search that {{successively}} shortens the interval in which the maximum of a unimodal function lies. Given a finite interval, a unimodal function, and the maximum length of the resulting interval, Fibonacci search finds a Fibonacci number such that if the interval is divided equally into that many subintervals, the subintervals would be shorter than the maximum length. After dividing the interval, it eliminates the subintervals in which the maximum cannot lie until one or more <b>contiguous</b> subintervals remain.|$|E
5|$|For {{purposes}} of the Office for National Statistics, Manchester forms the most populous settlement within the Greater Manchester Urban Area, the United Kingdom's third-largest conurbation. There {{is a mixture of}} high-density urban and suburban locations in Manchester. The largest open space in the city, at around , is Heaton Park. Manchester is <b>contiguous</b> on all sides with several large settlements, except for a small section along its southern boundary with Cheshire. The M60 and M56 motorways pass through the south of Manchester, through Northenden and Wythenshawe respectively. Heavy rail lines enter the city from all directions, the principal destination being Manchester Piccadilly station.|$|E
5|$|Hapticity {{is a term}} to {{describe}} the coordination {{of a group of}} <b>contiguous</b> atoms of a ligand bound to the central atom; it is indicated by the Greek character eta, η. Yttrium complexes were the first examples of complexes where carboranyl ligands were bound to a d0-metal center through a η7-hapticity. Vaporization of the graphite intercalation compounds graphite–Y or graphite– leads to the formation of endohedral fullerenes such as Y@C82. Electron spin resonance studies indicated the formation of Y3+ and (C82)3− ion pairs. The carbides Y3C, Y2C, and YC2 can be hydrolyzed to form hydrocarbons.|$|E
5|$|Historically, most European newts were {{included}} in the genus, but taxonomists have split off the alpine newts (Ichthyosaura), the small-bodied newts (Lissotriton) and the banded newts (Ommatotriton) as separate genera. The closest relatives of Triturus are the European brook newts (Calotriton). Two species of marbled newts and seven species of crested newts are accepted, of which the Anatolian crested newt was only described in 2016. Their ranges are largely <b>contiguous</b> but where they do overlap, hybridisation may take place.|$|E
5|$|Ibn Batuta has {{reasoned}} that Muhammad Shah wished {{to see a}} unified city comprising Old Delhi, Siri, Jahanpanah and Tughlaqabad with one <b>contiguous</b> fortification encompassing them but cost considerations forced him to abandon the plan halfway. In his chronicle, Batuta also stated that the Hazar Sutan Palace (1000 pillared palace), built outside the Siri fort limits but within the Jahanpanah city area, was the residence of the Tughlaq.|$|E
5|$|It {{is listed}} on Appendix II {{as it has}} an {{unfavourable}} conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements. In addition, the fin whale is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and <b>Contiguous</b> Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU).|$|E
5|$|Many of the wettest {{tropical}} cyclones in the United States {{have moved}} into the <b>contiguous</b> United States from the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the eastern Pacific Ocean. The highest rainfall totals in {{the country have been}} measured across the Gulf Coast and lower portions of the Eastern Seaboard. Intermediate amounts have been measured across the Southwest, New England, and the Midwest. The northern Great Plains and Pacific Northwest have received the lowest amounts, as those regions lie exceptionally far from the breeding grounds of Atlantic and Eastern Pacific tropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|McCain {{was born}} in the Panama Canal Zone. Had he been elected, he would have become the first {{president}} who was born outside the <b>contiguous</b> forty-eight states. This raised a potential legal issue, since the United States Constitution requires the president to be a natural-born citizen of the United States. A bipartisan legal review, and a unanimous but non-binding Senate resolution, both concluded that he is a natural-born citizen. Also, if inaugurated in 2009 at age 72years and 144days, he would have been the oldest U.S. president upon ascension to the presidency, and the second-oldest president to be inaugurated.|$|E
5|$|Mint is {{a premium}} airline product offered by JetBlue on some flights between the West Coast and the East Coast of the <b>contiguous</b> United States, and {{seasonally}} on some flights between the United States and Caribbean destinations. The service is operated with {{a fleet of}} Airbus A321 aircraft in a premium configuration, with lie-flat seats in premium class. As of May 2016, JetBlue is the only low cost airline in the Americas offering a dedicated premium product.|$|E
5|$|Note: {{station and}} route details are {{confined}} to those opened during GPK days, and the subsequent history of those stations and routes; details of stations opened on the route later than 1850, and of <b>contiguous</b> routes opened later, {{can be found in}} the Glasgow and South Western Railway article. Locations in italic were not passenger stations; entries in bold are passenger stations open at the present.|$|E
5|$|One {{neighborhood}} of New York County is <b>contiguous</b> with the U.S. mainland. Marble Hill {{at one time}} was part of Manhattan Island, but the Harlem River Ship Canal, dug in 1895 to improve navigation on the Harlem River, separated it from the remainder of Manhattan as an island between the Bronx and the remainder of Manhattan. Before World War I, {{the section of the}} original Harlem River channel separating Marble Hill from The Bronx was filled in, and Marble Hill became part of the mainland.|$|E
5|$|Prior to truncation, US395 {{served the}} {{metropolitan}} areas of San Diego and San Bernardino. The highway {{serves as a}} connection to the Los Angeles area for the communities of the Owens Valley, Mammoth Lakes and Mono Lake. The highway is used as an access for both the highest point in the <b>contiguous</b> United States, Mount Whitney, and the lowest point in North America, Death Valley.|$|E
5|$|Reptiles {{evolved from}} amphibious {{ancestors}} which left the aquatic lifestyle and became terrestrial. To prevent loss of moisture reptilian skin lost the softness and moisture of amphibian skin {{and developing a}} thick stratum corneum with multiple layers of lipids which served as an impermeable barrier as well as provided protection from the ultraviolet. Over time, reptilian skin cells became highly keratinised, horny, sturdy and desiccated. The surfaces of the dermis and epidermis of all reptilian scales form a single <b>contiguous</b> sheet, {{as can be seen}} when the snake sheds its skin as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Retinopathy of {{prematurity}} may regress spontaneously, {{but should}} the disease progress beyond a threshold (defined as five <b>contiguous</b> or eight cumulative hours of stage 3 retinopathy of prematurity), both cryosurgery and laser surgery {{have been shown}} {{to reduce the risk of}} blindness as an outcome. Where the disease has progressed further, techniques such as scleral buckling and vitrectomy surgery may assist in re-attaching the retina.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{migration}} of the endangered gray wolf into Shoshone National Forest after the successful wolf reintroduction program in the Yellowstone region commenced in the mid-1990s, all of the known 70 mammal species that existed prior to white settlement still exist in the forest. Altogether, at least 335 species of wildlife call Shoshone National Forest their home, including the largest population of Bighorn sheep {{and one of the}} few locations Grizzly bears can still be found in the <b>contiguous</b> U. S..|$|E
5|$|Since then, {{the volcano}} has been dormant, {{although}} some steam still rises from small vents in its summit {{and on its}} flanks. Pumice ejected during the 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak is conspicuously banded with light streaks of dacite and dark andesite, which appears to represent two distinct magmas imperfectly mixed during the eruption. The 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak was the second most recent volcanic outburst in the <b>contiguous</b> 48 U.S. states (after the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington).|$|E
5|$|Some {{controversy}} has existed over {{the origins of}} captive breeding stock used by The Peregrine Fund in the recovery of peregrine falcons throughout the <b>contiguous</b> United States. Several peregrine subspecies {{were included in the}} breeding stock, including birds of Eurasian origin. Due to the extirpation of the eastern anatum (Falco peregrinus anatum), the near extirpation of the anatum in the Midwest, and the limited gene pool within North American breeding stock, the inclusion of non-native subspecies was justified to optimize the genetic diversity found within the species as a whole.|$|E
