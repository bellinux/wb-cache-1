2500|$|In France, intellectuals, {{because they}} had a chance of being {{published}} and could call on their “audience” to purchase their books, were able to express themselves on the subject of captivity. Their message, which naturally was not representative of all prisoners’ experiences, took several forms. Gaston Riou developed European themes in 1928 in his best-known work, Europe, ma patrie. The rapprochement with Germany that he outlined remained solely cultural, indeed superficial. Jacques Rivière, a prisoner since 24 August 1914, took an entirely different approach, developed in L’Allemand: “I must confess frankly: a relationship is described here, rather than an objective, rather than an appearance [...] The subject of my book is Franco-German antagonism”. Rivière developed a theory of economic rapprochement that would find fruition after the next world war: “Forgetfulness will develop, in Germany and here, if we know to organise industrial unity in the Rhine basin, if we know to harmoniously regulate trade there [...] There is all the same, in our <b>current</b> <b>occupation</b> of the Ruhr, with whatever intensity it has borne the Franco-German crisis, the foreshadowing of an equilibrium and a possible harmony between the two countries”.|$|E

30|$|The {{empirical}} results {{state that}} knowing, or if necessary estimating from past <b>occupations,</b> two spouses’ <b>current</b> <b>occupations,</b> helps predict whether their marriage will dissolve.

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} {{theoretical}} framework to study organizational embeddedness and occupational embeddedness. Organizational embeddedness is the totality of forces (fit, links, and sacrifices) that keep people in their current organizations, while occupational embeddedness is the totality of forces (fit, links, and sacrifices) that keep people in their <b>current</b> <b>occupations.</b> The proposed framework identifies the antecedents of these parallel processes and when and why they can diverge. It also highlights the role that individuals' career stages play in the embedding process. The article concludes {{with a discussion of}} avenues for future research on job turnover and occupation change and implications for management practice. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

There has been an increasing number of second-career in LIS emerging from many other non-LIS-related professions over the years. Many of these newcomers have made significant contributions to the LIS profession as they transfer their years of professional experiences, expertise, knowledge and skills from their former careers into the field.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} how social class, measured at 3 staged of life, contributes to mortality risk. METHODS: A cohort of employed Scottish men (n = 5567) provided their fathers' occupation {{and their own}} first and <b>current</b> <b>occupations,</b> from which social class in childhood, at labor-market entry, and at screening (1970 to 1973) was determined. Relative rates of mortality and relative indices of inequality were calculated from 21 years of follow-up. RESULTS: Mortality risk was similar at each stage of life, with men in the higher social classes having the lowest risk. Social class at screening produced the greatest relative indices of inequality. CONCLUSIONS: The widening of inequalities in mortality in adulthood suggests {{the importance of the}} accumulation of poor socioeconomic circumstances throughout life...|$|R

Some data were derived from The Role Outlook Study senior year questionnaire.

No significant association was found between women's career aspirations senior year and actual career behavior. Instead, marriage and the absence or presence of children differentiated working and non-working women.

40|$|We study spin-polarized {{transient}} transport in {{a quantum}} dot coupled to two ferromagnetic leads {{subjected to a}} rectangular bias voltage pulse. Time-dependent spin-resolved <b>currents,</b> <b>occupations,</b> spin accumulation, and tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) are calculated using both nonequilibrium Green function and master equation techniques. Both parallel and antiparallel leads' magnetization alignments are analyzed. Our main findings are: a dynamical spin accumulation that changes sign in time, a short-lived pulse of spin polarized current in the emitter lead (but not in the collector lead), and a dynamical TMR that develops negative values in the transient regime. We also observe that the intra-dot Coulomb interaction can enhance even further the negative values of the TMR. Comment: 7 pages, 6 figures.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{significance}} of the <b>current</b> <b>Occupations</b> movement for the reinvention of teaching and learning in higher education. The first part explores some of the theories and pedagogical practices that underlie the educational dimensions of the occupations. The second part offers illustrations of projects that are confronting similar issues in higher education. The projects are Student as Producer and the Social Science Centre, both located in the city of Lincoln, with which the authors are involved. We conclude by suggesting that while the concept and practice of occupation contributes much to the ongoing debate about the meaning and future of higher education, it can be further radicalized by emphasising Occupy¹s inherent dynamic sensibility. This radicalized dynamic sensibility is defined as a new ‘pedagogy of space and time’ (Lefebvre 1990) ...|$|R

40|$|Detailed education, {{employment}} and training histories have been constructed for a cohort of 440 male respondents from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. The employment histories show that most respondents without college degrees have experienced at least one occupational break since entering the labour force. The training histories show {{that most of those}} in employment in 1992 have had no formal training for their <b>current</b> <b>occupations.</b> An assessment of whether those who received training before or on entering the labour force have subsequently had more stable employment histories than those who have not shows that this is true of college-level vocational education but not of high school vocational education or training received in vocational/technical institutes. These findings suggest that the comprehensive provision of entry-level training for those not college-bound, as advocated by those promoting vocational education in high schools, cannot be justified in terms of labour market outcomes...|$|R
