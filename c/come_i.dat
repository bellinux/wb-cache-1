5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never <b>come.</b> <b>I</b> found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me {{from time to time in}} my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E

25|$|Miyagawa {{moved to}} the United States with the {{intention}} to learn English for only one year but ended up staying permanently. When she first moved by herself to upstate New York as a teenager, Miyagawa said she had difficulty making friends at school and assimilating into American culture. She stated that {{at the beginning of}} her life in America, “For years to <b>come,</b> <b>I</b> would cut myself off from Japan. My language skills deteriorated...I had no contact with its culture”. Now, she describes her identity as a “hybrid of acquired American beliefs and imagined Japanese sentiments”. She became a U.S citizen in 1993.|$|E

25|$|I defend {{absolutely}} Mr Farage's {{right to}} disagree about the policy or {{institutions of the}} Union, but not to personally insult our guests in the European Parliament or the country from which they may <b>come...</b> <b>I</b> myself fought for free speech as the absolute cornerstone of a democratic society. But with freedom comes responsibility– in this case, to respect the dignity of others and of our institutions. I am disappointed by Mr Farage's behaviour, which sits ill with the great parliamentary tradition of his own country. I cannot accept this sort of behaviour in the European Parliament. I invited him to apologise, but he declined to do so. I have therefore– {{as an expression of}} the seriousness of the matter– rescinded his right to ten days' daily allowance as a Member.|$|E
500|$|In 1801 in {{a letter}} to the Board of Admiralty, St Vincent made the now famous remark: [...] "I do not say, my Lords, that the French will not <b>come.</b> <b>I</b> say only they will not come by sea." [...] In 1801 St Vincent was {{replaced}} by Admiral William Cornwallis and the new Prime Minister Henry Addington promoted St Vincent to First Lord of the Admiralty.|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} in Nelson, Constantine made a deep {{impression}} and remained a [...] celebrity there even after leaving the town; [...] his general community involvement was such [...] that a regional historian described him as a [...] "local champion". He appreciated the greater freedom he enjoyed in Nelson as compared with Trinidad, where racial issues predominated. Although Nelson suffered {{from the effects of}} the Depression, Constantine's high earnings were never a source of resentment; of {{his time in}} Nelson he wrote: [...] "If I had not <b>come...</b> <b>I</b> could not have been the person I am today... I am a better citizen for the time I have spent in Nelson." ...|$|E

500|$|However, rumors persisted and it {{was later}} whispered in society that Rasputin had seduced not only the Tsarina but also the four grand duchesses. The gossip was fueled by ardent, yet by all {{accounts}} innocent, letters written to Rasputin by the Tsarina and the four grand duchesses which were released by Rasputin and which circulated throughout society. [...] "My dear, precious, only friend," [...] wrote Anastasia. [...] "How much I should {{like to see you}} again. You appeared to me today in a dream. I am always asking Mama when you will <b>come...</b> <b>I</b> think of you always, my dear, because you are so good to me..." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1960, the RAF {{contacted}} Stanley and {{the idea}} of restoring the murals was brought up. He was initially reluctant to return to restore his works due to the painful memories of war and captivity the murals would bring back to him: [...] "I didn't immediately want to <b>come.</b> <b>I</b> felt that there would be some sort of... trauma. I'm trying to forget this, you know, I tried so hard... It took years really to eliminate the memories and fears... the long drawn out experience and really waiting for death over three and a half years, it's long time to expect death. And I really tried to forget... But of course I was never able to do that." ...|$|E
500|$|Frustrated by his {{inability}} to capture his subject, Ingres broke down in tears in his studio, in company. Bertin recalled [...] "consoling him: 'my dear Ingres, don't bother about me; and above all don't torment yourself like that. You want to start my portrait over again? Take your own time for it. You will never tire me, and {{just as long as}} you want me to <b>come,</b> <b>I</b> am at your orders.'" [...] After agreeing to a breathing spell Ingres finally settled on a design. Early biographers provide differing anecdotes regarding the inspiration for the distinctive seated pose. Henri Delaborde said Ingres observed Bertin in this posture while arguing politics after dinner with his sons. According to Eugène Emmanuel Amaury Duval (he said was related to him by Bertin), Ingres noticed a pose Bertin took while seated outside with Ingres and a third man at a café.|$|E

500|$|... "Towards {{the end of}} last season, where I {{said the}} best is yet to <b>come,</b> <b>I</b> {{strongly}} felt that way because towards {{the end of last}} season we closed out the season strong. I knew that was a catalyst to really turn up the team, to get a little bit more out of everyone. Denny goes down with his knee injury. He comes back, obviously not 100 percent. The team steps up. We narrow the gap to try to pick him up knowing he's not going to be there, and we start winning races, even with a driver that is not 100 percent. Now that he's coming back healthier each week, we're winning more and more. I simply think that's the catalyst for us to move forward. It's easier when the morale is high to get a little bit more out of your guys. Our benchmark is ourselves and we're just trying to work on that." ...|$|E
500|$|On December 7, 2011, the Red Hot Chili Peppers {{were named}} 2012 inductees for the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. In an {{interview}} that same day, Anthony Kiedis talked about Frusciante and if he would attend the ceremony. Kiedis stated, [...] "It would be a guess on my behalf {{on whether or not}} he’ll <b>come.</b> <b>I</b> can’t imagine that he would, but it’s a 'you never know' kind of thing. I haven’t talked to him in quite a while. I don’t know where he’s at these days. He’ll obviously be more than welcome, and embraced if he does. If he doesn’t, that’s cool too." [...] Flea also spoke about Frusciante by saying [...] "He left us so many great gifts. He’s a phenomenal musician and songwriter who gave so much to our band. All the feelings I have for him not being in the band any more... He really took us to a higher level." [...] Frusciante eventually declined to be present for the Red Hot Chili Peppers' induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April.|$|E
