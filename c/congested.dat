40|$|Triangle-free graphs play {{a central}} role in graph theory, and {{triangle}} detection (or triangle finding) as well as triangle enumeration (triangle listing) play central roles in the field of graph algorithms. In distributed computing, algorithms with sublinear round complexity for triangle finding and listing have recently been developed in the powerful <b>CONGEST</b> clique model, where communication is allowed between any two nodes of the network. In this paper we present the first algorithms with sublinear complexity for triangle finding and triangle listing in the standard <b>CONGEST</b> model, where the communication topology is the same as the topology of the network. More precisely, we give randomized algorithms for triangle finding and listing with round complexity O(n^ 2 / 3 (n) ^ 2 / 3) and O(n^ 3 / 4 n), respectively, where n denotes the number of nodes of the network. We also show a lower bound Ω(n^ 1 / 3 / n) on the round complexity of triangle listing, which also holds for the <b>CONGEST</b> clique model. Comment: To appear in PODC 201...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the distributed {{construction of a}} deterministic local broadcasting schedule in the SINR model of interference. During the execution of such a schedule each node {{should be able to}} transmit one message to its neighbors. Our construction requires only O(∆ logn) time slots, where ∆ is the maximum node degree in the network and n the number of nodes. We prove that the length of the constructed schedule is asymptotically optimal, i. e. of length O(∆). Considering the simulation of <b>CONGEST</b> algorithms in the SINR model, our deterministic schedule achieves a runtime of O(τ∆ 2 + ∆ logn) time slots, where τ is the original runtime in the <b>CONGEST</b> model. We show that there is a lower bound of Ω(∆ 2) for the simulation of each one of the τ rounds, hence our simulation is optimal apart from the logarithmic factor. If we restrict the knowledge of the nodes and let the maximum node degree ∆ be unknown, we can prove that at least Ω(D +τ∆ 2) time slots are required to simulate synchronized <b>CONGEST</b> algorithms in the SINR model of interference, where D is the diameter of the network. For our algorithms we assume location information to be given. Regarding the case without location information we argue that a deterministic algorithm to compute local broadcasting schedules by Derbel and Talbi [ICDCS’ 10], which requires transmission power adaption, needs messages of size O(logn) to simulate <b>CONGEST</b> algorithms. This is a logarithmic factor less than stated by the authors. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{broadcast}} {{version of the}} <b>CONGEST</b> CLIQUE model of distributed computing. In this model, in each round, any node in a network of size n can send the same message (i. e. broadcast a message) of limited size to every other node in the network. Nanongkai presented in [STOC' 14] a randomized (2 +o(1)) -approximation algorithm to compute all pairs shortest paths (APSP) in time Õ(√(n)) on weighted graphs, where we use the convention that Ω̃(f(n)) is essentially Ω(f(n) /polylogf(n)) and Õ(f(n)) is essentially O(f(n) polylogf(n)). We complement this result by proving that any randomized (2 -o(1)) -approximation of APSP and (2 -o(1)) -approximation of the diameter of a graph takes Ω̃(n) time in the worst case. This demonstrates that getting a negligible improvement in the approximation factor requires significantly more time. Furthermore this bound implies that already computing a (2 -o(1)) -approximation of all pairs shortest paths is among the hardest graph-problems in the broadcast-version of the <b>CONGEST</b> CLIQUE model and contrasts a recent (1 +o(1)) -approximation for APSP that runs in time O(n^ 0. 15715) in the unicast version of the <b>CONGEST</b> CLIQUE model. On the positive side we provide a deterministic version of Nanongkai's (2 +o(1)) -approximation algorithm for APSP. To do so we present a fast deterministic construction of small hitting sets. We also show how to replace another randomized part within Nanongkai's algorithm with a deterministic source-detection algorithm designed for the <b>CONGEST</b> model presented by Lenzen and Peleg at PODC' 13...|$|R
