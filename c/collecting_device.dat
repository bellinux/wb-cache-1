40|$|Background: Recently, {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in facility cultivation area provided good conditions for wintering and breeding of whitefly. It {{has a tendency to}} increase the damage caused by whitefly every year. Therefore, remote control technology for whitefly reduction is in urgent need. Chemical use to control diseases and insects is 56. 7 %, and this is the cause of severe environmental pollution. An automatic white-fly <b>collecting</b> <b>device</b> is under development. In the study, a remote control system was designed and constructed for the <b>collecting</b> <b>device.</b> Methods: The white-fly <b>collecting</b> <b>device</b> is composed of a rail-moving motor, a fan-blower, an electric wire mesh, and UV lamps. Remote control system was designed and constructed so that the system components were individually controlled. And the status of each component could be monitored. Wireless communication was achieved by the ZigBee module in the greenhouse, and by the smartphone between the greenhouse and users. Performance of the monitoring component was tested by distance and the number of the system component. Overall remote monitoring and control performance was tested by different signal intensity and time of the day. Results and discussions: Monitoring performance was favourable within 15 m distance with the tested ZigBee module, and a wireless communication network was established considering the communication distance and greenhouse length (i. e. 100 m). Remote monitoring and control was successful for all of the tested signal intensity and time of the day, although the data transmission speed was affected significantly. Conclusion: Test results showed a promising result for remote monitoring and control of the system.
