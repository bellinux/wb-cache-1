He commissioned Boston architect James Lovell Little, Jr. to design and construct several buildings on the property, including outbuildings of a carriage house and horse stable in 1910, a <b>cow</b> <b>barn</b> in 1912, and a primary residence (the Appleton/Shaw House) in 1912.

2500|$|Ole Rise {{owned the}} manor for 9 years, before his {{interest}} {{was purchased by}} John Heftye (1849–1907). Rise then settled in Stjørdal, where he bought Ree farm. During the period he owned Austrått, he also owned Sundnes distillery {{on the island of}} Inderøy. There had previously been a dairy operation on Austrått, probably from 1858, and continuing until the dairy burned down sometime in 1879 and Rise continued it. Rise's stewardship of the Austrått property has been the source of some disagreement. Andersen/Bratberg writes that [...] "Rise ... has received a bad reputation as a man who depleted the property and was only interested in making the most money possible out of it"; while local historian Terje Sørensen wrote that [...] "Ole Rise ran the property well, putting into use the existing buildings and building an extension to the <b>cow</b> <b>barn.</b> It was called [...] "Rise Cow Barn." [...] He received the prize for good cattle care in 1875, and was awarded prizes at exhibitions of livestock and dairy products".|$|E

40|$|Modern {{livestock}} farming {{is an important}} contributor to ammonia (NH 3) emissions. In the Netherlands, 94 % of NH 3 emissions originate from agriculture, of which 34 % is emitted from commercial dairy <b>cow</b> <b>barns.</b> From current mechanistic modeling, {{it is known that}} the pH of urine puddles from cows {{is one of the most}} important variables in estimating NH 3 emissions. However, little pH data are available from commercial <b>cow</b> <b>barns.</b> Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate pH values and to study their dynamic behavior in fresh, on-floor urine puddles in these barns. To do this, the pH of urine puddles was measured for 4 h per puddle, and a model was developed to describe the pH behavior. In total, 26 fresh puddles were measured from cows at three commercial dairy farms in summer and winter. At farm level, we found initial pH values of 8. 1 through 8. 4, which increased to 8. 9 through 9. 4 after 4 h. The pH difference between summer and winter was 0. 3 (p < 0. 05), but this was not confirmed by comparisons at farm level. The pH curves of individual puddles varied substantially and could be fitted by a nonlinear regression model. This model contained correlated coefficients that were able to describe the main, known chemical processes of a urine puddle. However, no linear relationship was found between initial and final pH and thus between coefficients. On average, pH quickly increased initially, declined after 1 h, and became stable around a pH of 9. 15. We conclude that a pH curve will better describe the input variable in NH 3 emission modeling than the current situation of using a static pH value. Based on this study, we recommend using the mean measured pH curve as input for puddle simulation during NH 3 emission modeling of dairy <b>cow</b> <b>barns.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|As the Dutch {{government}} and dairy farming sector have given priority to reducing ammonia emission, {{the effect of}} diet on the ammonia emission from dairy <b>cow</b> <b>barns</b> was studied. In addition, the usefulness of milk urea content {{as an indicator of}} emission reduction was evaluated. An experiment was carried out with a herd of 55 to 57 Holstein-Friesian dairy cows housed in a naturally ventilated barn with cubicles and a slatted floor. The experiment was designed as a 3 x 3 factorial trial and repeated 3 times. During the experiment, cows were confined to the barn (no grazing) and were fed ensiled forages and additional concentrates. The default forage was grass silage. The nutritional experimental factors were: (1) rumen-degradable protein balance of the ration for lactating cows with 3 levels (0, 500, and 1000 g/cow per d), and (2) proportion of corn silage in the forage ration for lactating cows with 3 levels (0, 50, and 100 %) of forage dry matter intake. Several series of dynamic regression models were fitted. One of these models explained emission of ammonia by the nutritional factors and the temperature; another model explained ammonia emission by the bulk milk urea content and the temperature. The ammonia emission from the barn increased when levels of rumen-degradable protein balance increased. Furthermore, at a given level of rumen-degradable protein balance, the emission of ammonia correlated positively with the corn silage content in the forage ration. However, this correlation was not causal, but was the result of interaction between corn silage proportion and intake of ileal digestible protein. The bulk milk urea content and the temperature correlated strongly with the ammonia emission from the barn; the selected model accounted for 76 % of the variance in emission. It was concluded that the emission of ammonia from naturally ventilated dairy <b>cow</b> <b>barns</b> was strongly influenced by diet. The emission can be reduced approximately 50 % by reducing the rumen-degradable protein balance of the ration from 1000 to 0 g/cow per d. The milk urea content is a good indicator of emission reduction...|$|R

The study was conducted in 16 dairy farms (8 with tied stalls and 8 with loose housing) inTransylvania, in the cold season.

Air temperature, relative humidity and air flow velocity in the barns were determined simultaneously. The data were analyzed using theSPSSstatistical software. The airborne ammonia concentration and the bedding hygiene score had significantly (P > 0. 05) higher values in the barns with tie stalls. The ammonia concentration correlated positively with the bedding hygiene score in all the investigated farms. Keeping the bedding clean and dry in the dairy cows’ barns is an important factor in reducing the airborne ammonia concentration...|$|R

Ten primiparous crossbred 87. 5 % Holstein cattle were randomly divided into 2 groups of five animals each which were housed in Normal Shaded (NS) as non-cooled cows and in shaded with Misters and Fans (MF) as cooled cows. The cows in each group were supplemented of recombinant bovine Somatotropin (rbST) in each stage of lactation with three consecutive subcutaneous injections with 500 mg of rbST in every 14 days. The ambient temperature at 13 : 00 h in the MF barn was significantly lower while relative humidity was higher than that of the NS <b>barn.</b> <b>Cows</b> under NS <b>barn</b> showed high rectal temperatures and respiration rate as compared with cows under the MF barn. Milk yield significantly increased in both cooled and non-cooled cows treated with rbST in each stage of lactation.

40|$|Wallemia sebi is a deuteromycete fungus {{commonly}} found in agricultural environments {{in many parts of}} the world and is suspected to be a causative agent of farmer's lung disease. The fungus grows slowly on commonly used culture media and is often obscured by the fast-growing fungi. Thus, its occurrence in different environments has often been underestimated. In this study, we developed two sets of PCR primers specific to W. sebi that can be applied in either conventional PCR or real-time PCR for rapid detection and quantification of the fungus in environmental samples. Both PCR systems proved to be highly specific and sensitive for W. sebi detection even in a high background of other fungal DNAs. These methods were employed to investigate the presence of W. sebi in the aerosols of a farm. The results revealed a high concentration of W. sebi spores, 107 m− 3 by real-time PCR and 106 m− 3 by cultivation, which indicates the prevalence of W. sebi in farms handling hay and grain and in <b>cow</b> <b>barns.</b> The methods developed in this study could serve as rapid, specific, and sensitive means of detecting W. sebi in aerosol and surface samples and could thus facilitate investigations of its distribution, ecology, clinical diagnosis, and exposure risk assessment...|$|R
