The <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>blind</b> or had low vision also had weaker hip extensors, but after LBW correction, only the blind children's hip extensors were weaker than those of the children with normal vision.

40|$|Children {{with visual}} {{impairments}} have a greater chance of suffering from chronic health problems associated with phys-ical inactivity, such as obesity and heart disease, than their sighted peers. In recent years, non-visual exergames have been explored as a promising health intervention method to increase their exercise opportunities. Because vision {{plays a major role}} in postural control, individuals <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> tend to have poor balance. To address this health issue, we developed a novel non-visual skiing exergame that is played using a pressure-sensitive input controller and haptic feed-back provided using a motion-sensing controller.

5000|$|The IDEA also {{authorized}} {{federal grants}} to states to cover {{some of the}} costs of special education services for youth aged three to twenty-one. Additions to the law focused on improving access to general education and curriculum (inclusion programs), developing appropriate assessments, implementing appropriate disciplinary procedures and alternative placements, and creating transition services for youth leaving the education system. This transition can be difficult for youth with a disability if it is too sudden- many of these youth struggle with the independence that graduation allows. In 2004, additions were made to promote better accountability for results, enhance parent involvement, encourage the use of proven practices and materials (increase research on current practices), and reduce administrative burdens for teachers, states and local school districts. Before 1975, only one in five children with identified disabilities attended public school, and many states explicitly excluded children with certain types of disabilities from school; these included <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>blind</b> or deaf, and children labeled [...] "emotionally disturbed" [...] or [...] "mentally retarded".|$|R
