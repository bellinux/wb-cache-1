500|$|Ruth's mastectomy after {{breast cancer}} was {{named one of}} the most {{shocking}} storylines from The Archers by The Daily Telegraph's Nick Collins. Stephen Glover from the Daily Mail wrote that Ruth [...] "was the least likely candidate in the village to join the ranks of Ambridge inhabitants who over the years have relished a bit on the side." [...] Glover's colleague Nigel Andrew was not a fan of the adultery storyline and wanted the old Ruth back, saying she had [...] "been replaced by Ruth Mark 2, a helpless overgrown teenager, reduced to a puddle of lust by amorous <b>cowman</b> Sam." [...] Rachel Cooke of the New Statesman was not a fan of the character at all, writing [...] "Ruth bores me to sobs, so I didn't give a fig that this was out of character." [...] Lezard noted that Ruth had gone from [...] "cheery supermum-farmer to lovelorn hysteric facing total loss".|$|E

2500|$|Burnett ran 10,000 cattle {{until the}} end of the lease in 1902. The cattle baron had a strong feeling for Indian rights, and his respect for them was genuine. Where other cattle kings fought Indians and the harsh land to build empires, Burnett learned Comanche ways, passing both the love of the land and his {{friendship}} with the Indians to his family. As a sign of their regard for Burnett, the Comanches gave him a name in their own language: Mas-sa-suta, meaning “Big Boss”. Parker earned the respect of US governmental leaders as he adapted to the white man’s life and became a prosperous rancher in Oklahoma. His spacious, two-story Star House had a bedroom for each of his seven wives and their children. He had his own private quarters, which were rather plain. Beside his bed were photographs of his mother Nadua (Cynthia Ann) and younger sister Prairie Flower. Parker extended hospitality to many influential people, both Native American and European American. Among the latter were the Texas surveyor W. D. Twichell and the cattleman Charles Goodnight. Of all his white acquaintances, Parker counted Burk Burnett the best. He reportedly said: “I got one good friend, Burk Burnett, he big-hearted, rich <b>cowman.</b> Help my people good deal. You see big man hold tight to money, afraid to die. Burnett helped anybody.” ...|$|E

Three {{months later the}} doughty <b>cowmen</b> confessed he {{was too much for}} them and telegraphed his father to come and take the wild man away. Also, when the father arrived to take him away, the <b>cowmen</b> allowed that they would vastly prefer chumming with howling cannibals, gibbering lunatics, cavorting gorillas, grizzly bears, and man-eating tigers than with this {{particular}} Young college product with hair parted in the middle.|$|R

But it was crooked, when you come down to truth. And though that may not be legally as criminal as the stealing of branded cattle, to my mind it is just as bad. Your father began that way, Hardman caught him, and perhaps forced him into worse practice." ...|$|R

2500|$|Edward Brass had no son and Lawrence's father James {{had died}} in 1918 so a deepened {{friendship}} between the young rancher and veteran cattleman became a strong business bond. When a buyer carrying a Brass and Meyers checkbook loaded them in 1929 with 14,000 head of Texas yearlings, Brass depended on Bixby to find the rangeland. The ranch leases that Bixby negotiated and held included 10,000 acres from Emmett Green, 10,000 acres at Spring Lake, a lease from Lester Hull on the Old Overton at 30,000 acres, the 19,000 acre Coffee Ranch on Leander Creek near Merriman and 20 sections on the Old Matador Ranch west of Kyle, South Dakota near Bear Creek. Edward Brass died in 1929, leaving Meyers in full control of the Sandhills corporation. In the late 1920s with Bixby running 12,000 head of Brass and Meyers hereford cattle, 3000 head of his own hereford's and a large draft and quarter remuda the ranch prospered but during the depression of the 1930s, Meyers reduced the company's total number of cattle and Bixby's 13-year relationship with the Sandhills Corporation ended in 1937. [...] "In the fall of 1937, I turned back 6,200 head of Sugar Bowl cattle. Ed Brass was dead, E.P. Meyers and Frank Wagoner were gone and the big Brass and Meyers deal was about over. We had 3,000 cows, 25,000 acres of the Spade and all I had to wonder was could I ever pay for it. Ed Brass was a great teacher and <b>cowman.</b> I tried to do everything that way he taught me, and I owe him a lot." [...] Bixby said. By 1940 Bixby {{had been able to}} regain 40 square miles (100 km2) of original Spade Ranch range, including the home valley headquarters.|$|E

5000|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the rest of}} the musical, [...] "The Farmer and the Cowman" [...] does not further the plot but does allow the audience to witness the tension between the farmers and the <b>cowmen,</b> a tension that comes from the farmers' desire to protect their crops with fences while the <b>cowmen</b> prefer the freedom to move cattle over a wide open range. Carnes, Aunt Eller and Ike act as peacemakers and attempt to reconcile the two sides. The song appears to have no effect, and the two sides start fighting. Aunt Eller then shoots a gun in the air to stop the fighting, and conducts both groups- ironically preaching peace with the lyrics of the song, but threatening violence.|$|R
