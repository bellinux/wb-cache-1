5|$|A single {{version of}} the song was {{recorded}} by American singer Christina Aguilera and became her debut single. She was 17 {{at the time it}} was released. The single's commercial success funded Aguilera's debut album from RCA, in addition to gaining her credibility amongst established writers and producers. Releases of the single were limited, which resulted in the track charting only on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, at number nineteen. An accompanying music video for the song was included on the DVD release of Mulan. Aguilera has performed the track on four televised performances, including at the <b>CBS</b> <b>This</b> <b>Morning</b> show, which saw her gain the attention of songwriter Diane Warren.|$|E

The Nine broadcasts features a map providing forecasts for Australia in place of national U.S. weather map (which itself is also, in a separate feature within the main weather segment, used as a cutaway to weather updates provided by local ABC affiliates).

25|$|As a CBS affiliate, WISH-TV {{cleared the}} {{majority}} of the CBS network schedule in its later years, with exception of the Saturday edition of <b>CBS</b> <b>This</b> <b>Morning,</b> the weekend editions of the CBS Evening News and the second half-hour of Face the Nation, which aired instead on WNDY. WNDY also aired other CBS programs channel 8 was unable to air due to extended breaking news or severe weather coverage, or special programming; such an example occurred from 2009 to 2011, when WNDY aired the US Open while WISH-TV opted to carry its regular programming schedule before syndicators made a Tuesday start to the syndicated season near-universal starting in 2012 after years of the US Open men's final always being delayed to Monday due to weather. For many years, WISH-TV had carried Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune, acquiring the local rights to the programs from NBC affiliate WTHR in the fall of 1988; both game shows moved back to WTHR in 2002.|$|E
25|$|When KDFW {{became a}} Fox {{affiliate}} on July 2, 1995, the station sharply expanded {{its emphasis on}} local news programming. It retained a news schedule {{similar to the one}} it had as a CBS affiliate, while increasing its news output from about 25 hours a week to nearly 40 hours (with its weekday news schedule expanding from 3½ hours to seven hours per day). In its early years with Fox, local news programming on the station ran on weekdays from 5:30 to 9:00a.m., 12:00 to 12:30p.m. and 6:00 to 6:30p.m., Saturday mornings, and nightly from 5:00 to 6:00p.m. and 9:00 to 10:30p.m. The weekday morning newscast's expansion from 1½ to three hours – {{with the addition of a}} two-hour extension from 7:00 to 9:00a.m.—and the consolidation of its half-hour weeknight 5:00 and 6:00p.m. newscasts into a single 90-minute block—although both programs were respectively structured as separate one-hour and half-hour broadcasts—filled timeslots vacated by the removals of <b>CBS</b> <b>This</b> <b>Morning</b> and the CBS Evening News from its schedule as Fox, unlike CBS, does not have daily national newscasts. Since Fox does not provide a third hour of network programming within its evening schedule, Channel 4 also added an hour-long prime time newscast at 9:00p.m. to lead into its existing 10:00p.m. newscast (KDFW is one of several Fox stations that offer newscasts in both the final hour of prime time and the traditional late news time slot—Fox Television Stations started to push news expansion into the latter in 2006—and one of ten that continued its Big Three-era late-evening newscast after switching to Fox; in contrast, Austin sister station KTBC aired syndicated programming as a lead-in for its existing 10:00p.m. newscast after it switched to Fox before it moved its late newscast to the 9:00p.m. hour in August 2000, that station would restore a late newscast in the former slot in September 2014).|$|E

Carlsson performed guitar, piano, synths, tambourine and handled the production and programming with Max Martin who also contributed with vocal production. It was recorded at MXM Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. The song was mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia.
