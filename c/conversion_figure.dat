2500|$|Treatment of DNA with {{bisulfite}} converts cytosine residues to uracil, but leaves 5-methylcytosine residues unaffected. Therefore, DNA {{that has}} been treated with bisulfite retains only methylated cytosines. Thus, bisulfite treatment introduces specific changes in the DNA sequence that depend on the methylation status of individual cytosine residues, yielding single-nucleotide resolution information about the methylation status of a segment of DNA. Various analyses can be performed on the altered sequence to retrieve this information. [...] The objective of this analysis is therefore reduced to differentiating between single nucleotide polymorphisms (cytosines and thymidine) resulting from bisulfite <b>conversion</b> (<b>Figure</b> 1).|$|E

The development design was grouped into four developmental procedures, consisting of: (1) exploration (2) development of draft/prototype, (3) expert validation and revision, and (4) try-out and final revision. The product testing involved four English teachers from four high schools in Pelabuhanratu.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} design of three high-performance successive-approximation-register (SAR) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) using distinct digital background calibration techniques under {{the framework of a}} generalized code-domain linear equalizer. These digital calibration techniques effectively and efficiently remove the static mismatch errors in the analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion. They enable aggressive scaling of the capacitive digital-to-analog converter (DAC), which also serves as sampling capacitor, to the kT/C limit. As a result, outstanding conversion linearity, high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), high conversion speed, robustness, superb energy efficiency, and minimal chip-area are accomplished simultaneously. The first design is a 12 -bit 22. 5 / 45 -MS/s SAR ADC in 0. 13 -μm CMOS process. It employs a perturbation-based calibration based on the superposition property of linear systems to digitally correct the capacitor mismatch error in the weighted DAC. With 3. 0 -mW power dissipation at a 1. 2 -V power supply and a 22. 5 -MS/s sample rate, it achieves a 71. 1 -dB signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio (SNDR), and a 94. 6 -dB spurious free dynamic range (SFDR). At Nyquist frequency, the <b>conversion</b> <b>figure</b> of merit (FoM) is 50. 8 fJ/conversion step, the best FoM up to date (2010) for 12 -bit ADCs. The SAR ADC core occupies 0. 06 mm 2, while the estimated area the calibration circuits is 0. 03 mm 2. The second proposed digital calibration technique is a bit-wise-correlation-based digital calibration. It utilizes the statistical independence of an injected pseudo-random signal and the input signal to correct the DAC mismatch in SAR ADCs. This idea is experimentally verified in a 12 -bit 37 -MS/s SAR ADC fabricated in 65 -nm CMOS implemented by Pingli Huang. This prototype chip achieves a 70. 23 -dB peak SNDR and an 81. 02 -dB peak SFDR, while occupying 0. 12 -mm 2 silicon area and dissipating 9. 14 mW from a 1. 2 -V supply with the synthesized digital calibration circuits included. 	The third work is an 8 -bit, 600 -MS/s, 10 -way time-interleaved SAR ADC array fabricated in 0. 13 -μm CMOS process. This work employs an adaptive digital equalization approach to calibrate both intra-channel nonlinearities and inter-channel mismatch errors. The prototype chip achieves 47. 4 -dB SNDR, 63. 6 -dB SFDR, less than 0. 30 -LSB differential nonlinearity (DNL), and less than 0. 23 -LSB integral nonlinearity (INL). The ADC array occupies an active area of 1. 35 mm 2 and dissipates 30. 3 mW, including synthesized digital calibration circuits and an on-chip dual-loop delay-locked loop (DLL) for clock generation and synchronization...|$|E

40|$|Various satellite-borne {{missions}} are being planned whose {{goal is to}} measure the polarization {{of a large number}} of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We show that the polarization pattern predicted by current models of GRB emission can be drastically modified by the existence of very light axion-like particles (ALPs), which are present in many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. Basically, the propagation of photons emitted by a GRB through cosmic magnetic fields with a domain-like structure induces photon-ALP mixing, which is expected to produce a strong modification of the original photon polarization. Because of the random orientation of the magnetic field in each domain, this effect strongly depends on the orientation of the photon line of sight. As a consequence, photon-ALP conversion considerably broadens the original polarization distribution. Searching for such a peculiar feature through future high-statistics polarimetric measurements is therefore a new opportunity to discover very light ALPs.

Population sizes were 4, 5, and 6 birds per cage. Birds in the shallow cages had higher hen-day egg production values, gained more weight, had larger egg weights and egg mass, produced more eggs grading large and extra large, used more feed, and had higher pullet and feed costs than birds in the deep cages.

30|$|In this study, {{cumulative}} substitution mutations {{were introduced}} into LinBUT, and various intermediate mutant enzymes between LinBUT and LinBMI were kinetically characterized (Figures 3, 4 and Table 1). Since LinB has promiscuous enzymatic activities towards various compounds, including other HCH isomers and various haloalkanes (Lal et al. [2010]), the functional evolution of LinB seems too complicated to analyze. However, we focused {{in this study}} on its β-HCH degradation activity as a representative model. Overall, the β-HCH degradation activities of the mutants gradually changed to those of a LinBMI-type enzyme according {{to the number of}} introduced mutations (Figure 5 a), indicating that the function of LinB towards this activity can evolve in a stepwise manner. However, the effects of the particular amino acid substitutions depended on the order of the introduced mutations or on the combination with other mutations, and every substitution influenced both the first and second <b>conversion</b> steps (<b>Figure</b> 5 b-f). Especially, the I 138 L mutation showed relatively strong positive effects on both conversion steps in almost all mutant enzymes examined (Figure 5 c), suggesting this mutation {{plays a key role in}} LinBMI-type activity. At the beginning of this study, we mainly focused on three mutations, A 112 V, I 138 L, and M 253 I, on the basis of the results of our previous mutational and structural analyses of LinBMI (Okai et al. [2013]), but our additional analysis in this study also confirmed the involvement of A 81 T and A 135 T mutations in β-HCH degradation activity (Figure 5 e, f). It is of interest that the T 81 residue of LinBMI was mainly involved in the first <b>conversion</b> step (<b>Figure</b> 5 e).

Calculated results show that compressive or tensile strain can induce conduction band minimum (CBM) or valence band maximum (VBM) transition, which produces important effects on Seebeck coefficient. It is found that compressive or tensile strain can induce significantly enhanced n- or p-type Seebeck coefficient at the critical strain of CBM or VBM transition, which {{can be explained by}} strain-induced band convergence. Another essential strain effect is that tensile strain can produce significantly reduced lattice thermal conductivity, and the room temperature lattice thermal conductivity at the strain of - 4. 02 % can decrease by about 60 % compared to unstrained one, which is very favorable for high ZT. To estimate efficiency of thermoelectric <b>conversion,</b> the <b>figure</b> of merit ZT can be obtained by empirical scattering time τ. Calculated ZT values show that strain indeed is a very effective strategy to achieve enhanced thermoelectric properties, especially for p-type doping. Tuning thermoelectric properties with strain also can be applied to other semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers MX_ 2 (M=Zr, Hf, Mo, W and Pt; X=S, Se and Te).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper, {{is to provide a}} means of {{estimating}} and comparing the wavelength <b>conversion</b> efficiency (<b>figure</b> of merit, FOM) of new nonlinear materials knowing only their bandgap. The approach for the estimates is trend analysis of existing data 1 - 28 for the second order nonlinear coefficient, x(2) ijk, or dij =x(2) ijk/ 2, the index of refraction n, and the bandgap E. No underlying physical basis for the result will be presented. The result of this trend analysis, in the form of plots of x(2) vs E and FOM vs E and the associated fit equations, will be used to estimate x(2) and the FOM for wavelength conversion efficiency for some new materials. The accuracy goal agrees within a factor of 2 - 5 with the experimental values, which is quite good considering the values range over four to seven orders of magnitude. In this paper, following the usual conventions, the x(2) values are treated as having constant values in the region of high transparency between the bandgap and the onset of multiphonon absorption, and the full x(2) values are used, which means the impact of the phase matching angle is ignored. The requirement to phase match often reduces significantly the effective x(2) values below those of the full values. The distinction between direct, indirect, or pseudodirect bandgaps is ignored and the minimum room temperature gap is used in all cases...|$|R
