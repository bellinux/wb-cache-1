50|$|For single winter grade oils, {{the dynamic}} {{viscosity}} is measured at different cold temperatures, specified in J300 {{depending on the}} viscosity grade, in units of mPa·s, or the equivalent older non-SI units, centipoise (abbreviated cP), using two different test methods. They are the <b>Cold</b> <b>Cranking</b> Simulator (ASTMD5293) and the Mini-Rotary Viscometer (ASTM D4684). Based on the coldest temperature the oil passes at, that oil is graded as SAE viscosity grade 0W, 5W, 10W, 15W, 20W, or 25W. The lower the viscosity grade, the lower the temperature the oil can pass. For example, if an oil passes at the specifications for 10W and 5W, but fails for 0W, then that oil must be labeled as an SAE 5W. That oil cannot be labeled as either 0W or 10W.|$|R

40|$|AbstractContemporary {{applications}} {{are changing the}} failure mechanisms of lead acid batteries. Sulfation at the negative electrode, acid stratification, and dendrite formation now precede positive electrode failures such as grid corrosion and active material shedding. To attenuate these failures, carbon has been explored as a negative electrode additive to increase charge acceptance, eliminate sulfation, and extend cycle life. Frequently, however, carbon incorporation decreases paste density and hinders manufacturability. Discrete carbon nanotubes (dCNT), also known as Molecular Rebar®, are lead acid battery additives which can be stably incorporated into either electrode to increase charge acceptance and cycle life with no change to paste density and without impeding the manufacturing process. Here, full-scale automotive batteries containing dCNT in the negative electrode or both negative and positive electrodes are compared to control batteries. dCNT batteries show little change to Reserve Capacity, improved <b>Cold</b> <b>Cranking,</b> increased charge acceptance, and enhanced overall system efficiency.

40|$|The {{ability for}} Li-ion {{batteries}} {{to operate at}} low temperatures is extremely critical {{for the development of}} energy storage for electric and hybrid electric vehicle technologies. Currently, Li-ion cells have limited success in operating at temperature below – 10 deg C. Electrolyte conductivity at low temperature is not the main cause of the poor performance of Li-ion cells. Rather the formation of a tight interfacial film between the electrolyte and the electrodes has often been an issue that resulted in a progressive capacity fading and limited discharge rate capability. The objective of our Phase I work is to develop novel electrolytes that can form low interfacial resistance solid electrolyte interface (SEI) films on carbon anodes and metal oxide cathodes. From the results of our Phase I work, we found that the interfacial impedance of Fluoro Ethylene Carbonate (FEC) electrolyte at the low temperature of – 20 degC is astonishingly low, compared to the baseline 1. 2 M LiPFEMC:EC:PC:DMC (10 : 20 : 10 : 60) electrolyte. We found that electrolyte formulations with fluorinated carbonate co-solvent have excellent film forming properties and better de-solvation characteristics to decrease the interfacial SEI film resistance and facilitate the Li-ion diffusion across the SEI film. The very overwhelming low interfacial impedance for FEC electrolytes will translate into Li-ion cells with much higher power for <b>cold</b> <b>cranking</b> and high Regen/charge at the low temperature. Further, since the SEI film resistance is low, Li interaction kinetics into the electrode will remain very fast and thus Li plating during Regen/charge period be will less likely to happen...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reports a}} {{numerical}} {{activity on the}} investigation of the spray evolution within the combustion chamber of an automotive DISI engine under low-temperature cranking operations. In view of the high injected fuel amount and the strongly reduced fuel vaporisation at <b>cold</b> <b>cranking,</b> wall wetting becomes a critical issue. Under such conditions, fuel deposits around the spark plug region can affect the ignition process, and even prevent engine start-up. In fact, due to the low injection pressure at engine start-up, the fuel shows almost negligible atomisation and breakup, and the spray structure at the swirl-type injector nozzle is characterized by a single column of liquid fuel, strongly limiting the subsequent vaporisation and enhancing the fuel-wall interaction. In order to properly investigate and understand the many involved phenomena, experimental visualisation of the full injection process by means of an optically accessible engine would be a very useful tool. Nevertheless, the application of such technique, far from being feasible from an industrial point of view, appears to be very difficult even in research laboratories, due to the relevant wall wetting at cranking conditions. CFD analyses prove therefore to be the sole chance to gain a full insight of the overall process, to correlate spark plug wetting to both the combustion chamber design and the injection profile and eventually address either design modifications or changes in the injection strategies. In order to limit the overall number of modelling uncertainties, and to validate the spray model under actual cranking conditions, comparisons with available experimental data at low temperature and low injection pressure were performed and are reported in the paper...|$|R

With {{the assistance of}} electromagnetic field calculation software using FEM simulations, the performance characteristics as well as thermal capability have been analyzed. By utilizing full vehicle simulations, the machines have been evaluated and the performance quantified when they are implemented in a 48 V mild hybrid system. Moreover, power losses for whole operating regions in various machine components have been specified, which are used as input data for the thermal models. From the thermal model, the temperature distribution within the machines have been determined during continuous operation. In this work, four machine topologies were chosen to be studied: PMSM, SynRM, PMSynRM and IM. A number of operating points relevant to mild hybrid systems were selected {{to be used as}} basis for the performance comparison. From the simulations, {{it was found that the}} 8 -pole PMSM has the highest operating efficiency of 96. 9 %. The implemented ferrite magnets of the PMSynRM improve the highest operating efficiency by 1 % and increase the maximum torque by 7 Nm compared to the SynRM.

40|$|The {{cold start}} {{performance}} of automotive diesel engines is currently poor {{when compared to}} similar gasoline units. This thesis describes an experimental and theoretical investigation into the factors limiting diesel cold start behaviour. Studies {{have been carried out}} on IDI and DI designs of engine. Start behaviour has been characterised in terms of times taken to complete various stages of startup, engine speed variations and processes which affect these. Combustion and friction behaviour have been investigated in detail. Engine friction losses are dependent on temperature. During start-up these losses are relatively high compared to those when the engine is fully-warm. The work output from combustion is low at low speeds, and prone to a further deterioration at lower temperatures. Consequently, combustion output during <b>cold</b> <b>cranking</b> is initially insufficient to overcome frictional losses. The start times are extended by the need to keep the starter motor engaged until heat generated in the engine causes frictional losses to fall. Eventually, when combustion output is able to overcome friction without the aid of starter motor work, idle speed is reached. Changes to fuel injection and glowplug parameters have been used to achieve a limited improvement in low-temperature starting. Measurements of engine friction have been carried out to determine the influence of temperature and speed, and the relative contributions from each of the main component assemblies. At low temperatures, much of the friction originates in hydrodynamically lubricated components such as journal bearings, due to high oil viscosity at low temperature. Additionally, engine friction as rotation begins {{has been shown to be}} far higher than measured by conventional "steady-state" motoring tests (over twice the quasi-steady state friction at - 200 e). This initially high friction transient decays towards the quasi-steady values throughout the start. For crankshaft bearings, a friction model has been developed for cold start-up through to fully warm engine conditions. The friction behaviour in the bearings is dependent on thermal conditions around the friction surfaces. Models for the starter system and blowby processes are also presented as part of a broader theoretical investigation to assess the impact of design changes on start quality...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that a {{conventional}} lead acid cell that is exposed to a partial state of charge capacity cycling (PSoCCC) would experience a build-up of irreversible PbSO 4 on the negative electrode. This results into a damaged negative electrode due to excessive PbSO 4 formation by the typical visual “Venetian Blinds” effect of the active material. This displays the loss of adhesion of the active material with the electrode’s grids thereby making large sections of the material ineffective and reducing the cells useful capacity during high current applications. The addition of certain graphites to the negative paste mix had proven to be successful to reduce this effect. In {{the first part of the}} study, the physical and chemical properties of the various additives that are added to the negative electrode paste mix were comparatively studied. This was done to investigate any significant differences between various suppliers that could possibly influence the electrochemical characteristics of the Pb-acid battery performance. This comparative study was done by using the following analytical techniques; BET surface area, laser diffraction particle size, PXRD, TGA-MS and SEM. The study showed that there were no significant differences between the additives supplied from different suppliers except for some anomalies in the usefulness of techniques such as N 2 adsorption to study the BET surface area of BaSO 4. In order to reduce the sulphation effect from occurring within the Pb-acid battery a number of adjustments are made to the electrode active material. For example, Pb-acid battery manufacturers make use of an inert polymer based material, known as Polymat, to cover the electrode surfaces as part of their continuous electrode pasting process. It is made from a non woven polyester fiber that is applied to the pasted electrodes during the continuous pasting process. In this study the Polymat pasted electrodes has demonstrated a better physical adhesion of the active material to the grid support thereby maintaining the active material’s physical integrity. This however did not reduce the sulphation effect due to the high rate partial state of capacity cycling (HRPSoCCC) test but reduced the physical damage due to the irreversible active material blistering effect. The study investigated what effect the Polymat on the electrodes has on the III battery’s <b>Cold</b> <b>Cranking</b> Ability (CCA) at - 18 degree C, the HRPSoCCC cycling and its active material utilization. The study showed that there was little or no differences in the CCA and HRPSoCCC capabilities of cells made with the Polymat when compared to cells without the Polymat, with significant improvement in active material’s adhesion and integrity to the grid wire. This was confirmed by PXRD and SEM analysis. Negative electrodes were made with four types of graphites (natural, flake, expanded and nano fibre) added to the negative paste mixture in order to reduce the effect of sulphation. The study looked at using statistical design of experiment (DoE) principles to investigate the variables (additives) such as different graphites, BaSO 4 and Vanisperse to the negative electrode paste mixture where upon measuring the responses (electrochemical tests) a set of controlled experiments were done to study the extent of the variables interaction, dependency and independency on the cells electrochemical properties. This was especially in relation to the improvement of the battery’s ability to work under HRPSoCCC. The statistical analysis showed that there was a notable significant influence of the amounts of vanisperse, BaSO 4 and their respective interactions on a number of electrochemical responses, such as the Peukert constant (n), CCA discharge time, material utilization at different discharge rates and the ability to capacity cycle under the simulated HRPSoCCC testing. The study did not suggest an optimized concentration of the additives, but did give an indication that there was a statistical significant trend in certain electrochemical responses with an interaction between the amounts of the additives BaSO 4 and Vanisperse. The study also showed that the addition of a small amount of Nano carbon can significantly change the observed crystal morphology of the negative active material and that an improvement in the number of capacity cycles can be achieved during the HRPSoCCC test when compared to the other types of graphite additive...|$|R
