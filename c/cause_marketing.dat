Through its fundraising arm, the Statue of Liberty–Ellis Island Foundation, Inc., the group raised more than $350million in donations. The Statue of Liberty was one of the earliest beneficiaries of a <b>cause</b> <b>marketing</b> campaign. A 1983 promotion advertised that for each purchase made with an American Express card, the company would contribute one cent to the renovation of the statue. The campaign generated contributions of $1.7million to the restoration project.|$|E

50|$|A similar phrase, Cause-related marketing, usually {{refers to}} a subset of <b>cause</b> <b>marketing</b> that {{involves}} the cooperative efforts of a for-profit business and a non-profit organization for mutual benefit. A high-profile form of Cause-Related Marketing occurs at checkout counters when customers are asked to support a cause with a charitable donation. <b>Cause</b> <b>marketing</b> differs from corporate giving (philanthropy), as the latter generally involves a specific donation that is tax-deductible, while <b>cause</b> <b>marketing</b> is a promotional campaign not necessarily based on a donation.|$|E

50|$|With that said, {{there are}} some {{concerns}} related to <b>cause</b> <b>marketing.</b> The issue of trust has emerged as central to {{the potential for the}} impact of <b>cause</b> <b>marketing.</b> Specifically, 78% of consumers reported that a partnership between a nonprofit and a company that they trust makes a cause stand out (2010, Cone Nonprofit Marketing Trend Tracker). If a consumer doesn't trust the business that is behind the <b>cause</b> <b>marketing</b> campaign, it can be seen as an insincere effort to attract more loyalty from consumers. For that reason, {{it is important that the}} <b>cause</b> <b>marketing</b> campaign be authentic to the brand image of the products which are running the marketing campaign. Another potential issue with <b>cause</b> <b>marketing</b> is the possible increase in the price of the cause-related products. In fact, only 19% of consumers would be willing to buy a more expensive brand if it supported a cause (Cone, 2010). Consumers are also not sure about how much money actually gets donated, according to Eikenberry (2009). In the age of social media, it is essential that the business supporting the <b>cause</b> <b>marketing</b> campaign is transparent about how the funds are being used and what amount/percent of funds are donated to the cause.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cause</b> related <b>marketing</b> is a {{strategy}} that aims to communicate a company's striving for corporate social responsibility and to improve brand image. Previous studies showed that psychological an cognitive factors have {{a central role in}} the <b>cause</b> related <b>marketing</b> strategy as they influence the extent of people's emotional reactions toward the product-social cause link. <b>Cause</b> related <b>marketing</b> has been found to be more effective and trustable when the social cause is supported by a hedonic product because the donation is able to soothe the sense of guilt for the purchase of a frivolous good. The present study suggest that one of the factors involved in <b>cause</b> related <b>marketing</b> is mental accounting. A way to show the product-donation price is by providing people with the product price and the amount of the donation separately (separated mental accounting). On the other hand, people could be provided with a single price including the amount donated to the social cause (e. g., 5 % of the price; integrated mental accounting). We hypothesize that mental accounting should have an impact on people’s perception of a <b>cause</b> related <b>marketing</b> program. The effect of mental accounting should be different when comparing frivolous and utilitarian products...|$|R

50|$|Cause-related loyalty {{marketing}} {{is a recent}} trend in <b>cause</b> <b>marketing.</b> As the name implies, CLM is the marriage of <b>cause</b> <b>marketing</b> and loyalty programs. <b>Cause</b> <b>marketing</b> occurs when for-profit companies join forces with nonprofits to promote a cause. Recent examples include Nike, Inc. partnering with Livestrong, athlete Lance Armstrong’s cancer-fighting foundation, and Eastman Kodak teaming with stationery designer Bonnie Marcus in support of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. CLM, however, takes these donations and corporate social responsibility efforts one step further, wedding them to thousands of customer loyalty programs. Rather than requiring the outlay of funds from donors, CLM essentially “recycles” loyalty program members’ unused points or miles. It then converts them into usable currency for a cause of the loyalty members’ choosing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{framework}} {{presented in}} this paper suggests two major mediators that predict the <b>Cause</b> Related <b>Marketing</b> and purchase decision relationship; corporate image and brand attractiveness. A study of 278 students from universities and colleges of Pakistan provide basis for empirically defining the key role of above mentioned two mediators between <b>Cause</b> Related <b>Marketing</b> and consumer purchase decision. By studying the proposed framework, clear and real understanding of <b>Cause</b> Related <b>Marketing</b> and consumer purchase decision will help future researchers to further add new knowledge to the current understanding. For the proposed study, self-administered questionnaires developed on five-point Likert scale have been distributed in selected colleges and universities of Pakistan. To test the hypothesized relationships presented in theoretical model AMOS- 18 (Analysis of Moment Structures) has been used. In the end, the important sections as conclusion, limitations and recommendations are provided. This study provides empirical results specifying the relation of <b>Cause</b> Related <b>Marketing</b> and consumer purchase decision and extents the findings to get to the mediating role of corporate image and brand attractiveness. All the findings of the paper show the significant results of the relationship among <b>Cause</b> Related <b>Marketing</b> and purchase decision of the consumer mediated by corporate image and brand attractiveness...|$|R
