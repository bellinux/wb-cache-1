50|$|In {{the past}} few decades, the <b>cue</b> <b>dot</b> was used {{extensively}} on the ITV and Channel 4 television networks in the United Kingdom as a commercial break was approaching. This was {{for the benefit of}} the regional playout centres who would need to play in commercials for their region. Automation and playout servers led to this being phased out and it is now used only for some live presentations, especially those with regional opt-outs or variable ad breaks. The <b>cue</b> <b>dot</b> appears about 1 minute before the break and disappears 5 seconds before the break starts. ITV use a spinning black-and-white ticker in the corner of the screen. In recent years, ITV has reduced to using the <b>cue</b> <b>dot</b> during coverage of sporting events (e.g. football matches), and any other programmes that are being broadcast live.|$|E

The {{most common type of}} television <b>cue</b> <b>dot</b> is the IBA style, used around the world, which consists of a small square in the top right corner of the screen, with black and white moving stripes. The other is a proprietary system used principally by the BBC (who do not air commercials). This version is a static square in the top left corner with a white-black-white pattern.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to explore {{processes}} potentially implicated in the formation of symptoms of psychopathology. It was hypothesized that the "adaptiveness" of the individual is reflected in stress-related patterns of mood change, cardiac activity, and selective attention. Cognitive adaptiveness to stress was defined by a profile of five personality traits: locus of control, self-efficacy, self-esteem, optimism, and anxiety. The sample consisted of 38 normally functioning university students who were assigned the stress-inducing task of preparing and presenting a speech for evaluation by a panel of "judges". Stress was assessed via a mood questionnaire and heart rate. Selective attention was evaluated using a reaction time computer task in which participants responded to a dot appearing in the spatial location formerly occupied by either a threat or neutral <b>cue</b> (<b>dot</b> probe task). Faster latencies to dot probes replacing threat cues indicate attentional bias to threat. In general, the results supported the hypothesis that individual differences in adaptiveness affect stress reactions in ways that could increase the risk of psychopathology. Specifically, it was found that: (a) individuals low in adaptiveness reported more stress-related mood lowering than those high in adaptiveness, even after differences prior to stress were statistically controlled; (b) low adaptives avoided threat cues more than high adaptives in anticipation of an imminent threat; (c) low adaptives showed more instability in selective attention patterns than high adaptives; and (d) the greater the stress-related physiological arousal, the better the mood in high adaptives. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of risk and psychopathology...|$|E
40|$|Findings that illusory {{contours}} {{can facilitate}} visual detection of a subthreshold real line (Dresp & Bonnet, 1995) were not replicated, when line-induced instead of edge-induced illusory contour stimuli were used (Salvano-Pardieu et al., 2006). Rather, {{the results of}} the latter study supported the importance of spatial cues. The present study was designed to investigate whether spatial cueing might also facilitate detection of targets superimposed on edge-induced illusory contours. In Experiment 1, a target line was superimposed on the illusory contour of a Kanizsa square, presented between dots with a precise or distant location to the target, or on a homogeneous field (control). Detection of the target was poorest for the control, followed by the distant-dots and Kanizsa conditions, whereas it was best for precisely <b>cueing</b> <b>dots.</b> Experiment 2 replicated the conditions in Experiment 1 (Kanizsa, precisely <b>cueing</b> <b>dots,</b> and control) with additional controls for possible luminance effects. The two new conditions matched the Kanizsa condition for overall luminance and preciseness of spatial cueing without generating illusory contours. Performance was best in the dot condition and worst in the control, but the same across the Kanizsa and matched luminance conditions. In Experiments 3 and 4, the stimuli presented were matched more closely to those used by Dresp and Bonnet, but still the results confirmed those obtained in our Experiments I and 2. Together, these experiments strongly suggest that detection is also facilitated by spatial cueing rather than subthreshold summation, in the case of edge-induced illusory contours...|$|R

40|$|We used a haptic {{enumeration}} task {{to investigate}} whether enumeration can be facilitated by perceptual grouping in the haptic modality. Eight {{participants were asked to}} count tangible dots as quickly and accurately as possible, while moving their finger pad over a tactile display. In Experiment 1, we manipulated the number and organization of the dots, while keeping the total exploration area constant. The dots were either evenly distributed on a horizontal line (baseline condition) or organized into groups based on either proximity (dots placed in closer proximity to each other) or configural <b>cues</b> (<b>dots</b> placed in a geometric configuration). In Experiment 2, we varied the distance between the subsets of dots. We hypothesized that when subsets of dots can be grouped together, the enumeration time will be shorter and accuracy will be higher than in the baseline condition. The results of both experiments showed faster enumeration for the configural condition than for the baseline condition, indicating that configural grouping also facilitates haptic enumeration. In Experiment 2, faster enumeration was also observed for the proximity condition than for the baseline condition. Thus, perceptual grouping speeds up haptic enumeration by both configural and proximity cues, suggesting that similar mechanisms underlie perceptual grouping in both visual and haptic enumeration...|$|R

40|$|Question: Oscillatory brain {{activity}} in specific frequency bands has {{been related to}} cognitive processes such as attention (Foxe and Snyder (2011) Front Psychology 2 : 154). While {{in the domain of}} endogenous top-down control of visuospatial attention, occipito-parietal oscillations in the alpha band have been causally implicated (Romei et al. (2010) Journal of Neurosci. 30 (25) : 8692 – 8697), the oscillatory signatures underlying reflexively driven orienting of spatial attention and its time course remain unclear. In this study, we employed electrophysiology (EEG) and concurrent single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during a cued visuospatial detection task, known to induce reflexive shifts of attention and inhibition-of-return (IOR). Methods: Participants (n = 13) performed an exogenously <b>cued</b> <b>dot</b> detection task while the time course of the IOR was measured at four different cue-target delays (from 105. 8 – 705. 8 ms). The cue consisted of a brief flash in the left or right visual field and was task-irrelevant and uninformative as to forthcoming target location. In one quarter of the trials a single pulse TMS was delivered over the right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) at the longest cue-target delay (705. 8 ms) whilst changes in {{brain activity}} were measured with EEG. Results: The behavioural analysis revealed significantly faster reaction times to targets at cued relative to uncued positions at the early cue-target delay, which reversed to significantly faster reaction times to uncued relative to cued positions (i. e, an IOR) at the later cue-target delays. Ongoing analyses of the EEG measurements focuses on identifying the key frequency bands implicated in reflexive shifts of attention in TMS-free trials, complemented by analyses of the oscillatory response to single-pulse TMS over the right parietal cortex at the maximal time of IOR. Conclusions: Our behavioural findings reveal that our experimental manipulation induced a reflexive shift of attention as expected, allowing us to examine the EEG/TMS-EEG data for underlying oscillatory brain activities...|$|R
40|$|A “follow-the-dot ” {{method was}} used to {{investigate}} the visual memory systems supporting accumulation of object information in natural scenes. Participants fixated a series of objects in each scene, following a <b>dot</b> <b>cue</b> from object to object. Memory for the visual form of a target object was then tested. Object memory was consistently superior for the two most recently fixated objects, a recency advantage indicating a visual short-term memory component to scene representation. In addition, objects examined earlier were remembered at rates well above chance, with no evidence of further forgetting when 10 objects intervened between target examination and test and only modest forgetting with 402 intervening objects. This robust prerecency performance indicates a visual long-term memory component to scene representation...|$|R
30|$|As {{into the}} ‘Café Wall’ {{illusion}} explained before, in the ‘Complex Bulge’ pattern, the DoG {{output of the}} model includes two distinct grouping arrangements, {{in this case a}} ‘Central Bulge’ and an ‘X-shape’ induction, with incompatible effects on the border shifts. It seems that the ‘X-shape’ percept arises from global perception when we focus {{on the periphery of the}} pattern, while the ‘Bulge effect’ is the result of focusing on the central area close to the central tile or on the inducing superimposed <b>dot</b> <b>cues</b> on the checkerboard; therefore, it is a local percept. To summarize, the multiple-scale DoG edge map of the ‘Complex Bulge’ pattern reveals two distinct and incompatible precepts or grouping structures arising simultaneously and results from our local to global percept of the pattern, contributing to bulge induction in the pattern.|$|R
40|$|Minimal {{discrete}} shape <b>cues,</b> i. e., <b>dots</b> {{that marked}} {{positions on the}} outer boundary of namable objects, {{were divided into two}} subsets, which were shown very quickly with a variable delay between subsets. Recognition of a given object required integration of the information provided by the two subsets, and previous research had found that recognition declined as the delay between subsets was increased. The present experiment found the decline in recognition to be linear for each of several levels of ambient illumination, dropping rapidly under photopic test conditions, and with the slope being progressively less steep with transition into the scotopic range. The change in the duration of information persistence {{may be related to the}} density of information that is provided under various lighting conditions, and a requirement that the information be buffered against noise or "packaged" to accommodate successive saccades...|$|R
40|$|Background: Interactive social {{contexts}} often require to perform actions dissimilar to those observed (i. e., complementary actions). To date, {{the role of}} attention in this endeavor is still unexplored. Methods: In the present research we aimed to study the role of spatial attention during action observation. The stimuli used were action sequences eliciting (or not) complementary responses in the participant’s hand. Spatial attention was manipulated {{by means of a}} red <b>dot</b> <b>cue</b> superimposed on the video clips. First, eye-tracking procedures were used to measure the spontaneous allocation of overt spatial attention during action observation. Second, we recorded motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess the excitability of corticospinal projections to hand muscles while participants were observing the action stimuli. Results: Results showed that the allocation of spatial attention plays no role when the observed action evokes an interactive complementary motor response. Overall, the present research provides one of the first evidence that social motor preparation is impervious to spatial attentional allocation...|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} for measuring photo interpretation performance {{from a single}} glance at a novel scene is presented. Subjects attempted to detect {{the presence or absence}} of a target. object, specified in advance by the object's name, from a cued position in a 150 -ms flash of a line drawing of a real-world scene. The <b>cue,</b> a <b>dot,</b> was presented immediately after the presentation of the scene, so that the subjects were uncertain as to the position of the cued object. Miss rates as a function of distance of the cued position from central fixation, target size, and degree of target camouflage were determined. The experiment also explored how these functions varied with objects that were in unexpected locations, such as a sofa floating in a street scene. Objects in these locations violated the usual constraints which characterize the organization of real-world scenes. Large, uncamouflaged targets in a normal relation to their context suffered only modestly from the effects of increasing distance from fixation. But targets that were small, camouflaged, or undergoing violations of the relational constraints suffered marked increases in miss rates when presented only 3 or 4 deg from central fixation. Since humans can assimilate visual information faster than the eye can move, the maximum rate at which a fixation can be made provides a limit-the saccadic barrier-of visual infor-mation processing. In addition to furnishing general guidelines for scene processing dis-plays, the results of this experiment serve to restrict the breaking of the barrier-with the aid of high-speed, high-capacity display systems-to the extraction of the setting or gist of a scene. Individual targets, unless large, uncamouflaged, and in expected locations, require direct fixation...|$|R
40|$|Attentional biases are {{described}} as the automatic deployment of attention to certain events in {{the environment of the}} individual. It is often assumed that these biases only occur for stimuli that gained relevance during evolution and in particular for negative emotional events (e. g., threatening animals). This preference for negative stimuli is explained by the high relevance of negative stimuli for survival. The present dissertation investigated (1) whether attentional biases to emotional events are indeed driven by the negativity of these stimuli or by high arousal levels and (2) whether attentional biases are limited to evolutionary relevant events or whether they will also be found for stimuli relevant to the temporary and current goals of an individual. Study one of the present dissertation confirms that high arousal levels drive attentional biases to emotional events which allows also positive emotional events to grab attention (e. g., erotica). In the remaining chapters of the dissertation, it was investigated whether stimuli relevant to a person’s actual and temporary goal influence the automatic allo-cation of spatial attention. A range of experiments using modified spatial <b>cueing</b> and <b>dot</b> probe paradigms found that stimuli relevant to an actual goal evoke an attentional bias. This bias reflects the motivational strength of goal pursuit meaning that attention is biased towards stimuli relevant to a prioritized goal when presented together with stimuli relevant to a less important goal. Furthermore, the bias persists when goal-relevant events are presented together with threatening events. The final chapter suggests that goals play also a role in emo-tional attention as attention in aversive emotions is biased towards stimuli that allow alleviating this emotion. These results support and extend old and recent accounts in research on motivation and attention that propose a modulation of automatic attentional processes by the current goals of a person...|$|R
40|$|Patients with apraxia perform poorly when demonstrating how {{an object}} is used, {{particularly}} when pantomiming the action. However, these patients {{are able to}} accurately identify, and {{to pick up and}} move objects, demonstrating intact ventral and dorsal stream visuomotor processing. Appropriate object manipulation for skilled use is thought to rely on integration of known and visible object properties associated with "ventro-dorsal" stream neural processes. In apraxia, {{it has been suggested that}} stored object knowledge from the ventral stream may be less readily available to incorporate into the action plan, leading to an over-reliance on the objects' visual affordances in object-directed motor behavior. The current study examined grasping performance in left hemisphere stroke patients with (N = 3) and without (N = 9) apraxia, and in age-matched healthy control participants (N = 14), where participants repeatedly grasped novel cylindrical objects of varying weight distribution. Across two conditions, object weight distribution was indicated by either a memory-associated cue (object color) or visual-spatial <b>cue</b> (visible <b>dot</b> over the weighted end). Participants were required to incorporate object-weight associations to effectively grasp and balance each object. Control groups appropriately adjusted their grasp according to each object's weight distribution across each condition, whereas throughout the task two of the three apraxic patients performed poorly on both the memory-associated and visual-spatial cue conditions. A third apraxic patient seemed to compensate for these difficulties but still performed differently to control groups. Patients with apraxia performed normally on the neutral control condition when grasping the evenly weighted version. The pattern of behavior in apraxic patients suggests impaired integration of visible and known object properties attributed to the ventro-dorsal stream: in learning to grasp the weighted object accurately, apraxic patients applied neither pure knowledge-based information (the memory-associated condition) nor higher-level information given in the visual-spatial cue condition. Disruption to ventro-dorsal stream predicts that apraxic patients will have difficulty learning to manipulate new objects on the basis of information other than low-level visual cues such as shape and size...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of stereoscopic vision on {{the perception of}} optic flow fields was investigated in experiments based on a recently described illusion. In this illusion, subjects perceive a shift {{of the center of}} an expanding optic flow field when it is transparently superimposed by a unidirectional motion pattern. This illusory shift {{can be explained by the}} visual system taking the presented flow pattern as a certain self-motion flow field. Here we examined the dependence of the illusory transformation on differences in depth between the two superimposed motion patterns. Presenting them with different relative binocular disparities, we found a strong variation in the magnitude of the illusory shift. Especially when translation was in front of expansion, a highly significant decrease of the illusory shift occurred, down to 25 % of its magnitude at zero disparity. These findings confirm the assumption that the motion pattern is interpreted as a self-motion flow field. In a further experiment we presented monocular depth <b>cues</b> by changing <b>dot</b> size and dot density. This caused a reduction of the illusory shift which is distinctly smaller than under stereoscopic presentation. We conclude that the illusory optic flow transformation is modified by depth information, especially by binocular disparity. The findings are linked to the phenomenon of induced motion and are related to neurophysiology...|$|R
40|$|Exogenous {{attention}} is an involuntary, reflexive orienting response {{that results in}} enhanced processing at the attended location. The standard view is that this enhancement generalizes across visual properties of a stimulus. We test whether {{the size of an}} exogenous cue sets the attentional field and whether this leads to different effects on stimuli with different visual properties. In a dual task with a random-dot kinematogram (RDK) in each quadrant of the screen, participants discriminated the direction of moving dots in one RDK and localized one red dot. Precues were uninformative and consisted of either a large or a small luminance-change frame. The motion discrimination task showed attentional effects following both large and small exogenous <b>cues.</b> The red <b>dot</b> probe localization task showed attentional effects following a small cue, but not a large cue. Two additional experiments showed that the different effects on localization were not due to reduced spatial uncertainty or suppression of RDK dots in the surround. These results indicate that the effects of exogenous attention depend {{on the size of the}} cue and the properties of the task, suggesting the involvement of receptive fields with different sizes in different tasks. These attentional effects are likely to be driven by bottom-up mechanisms in early visual areas...|$|R
40|$|Illusory line motion (ILM) is the {{illusion}} that a line, preceded by a small <b>dot</b> (<b>cue)</b> near one end, is perceived to shoot out from the dot even though the line is physically presented at once. Does this illusion result from a low-level motion effect, a gradient of exogenous spatial attention, or both? Given that exogenous attention speeds visual processing unequally at isoeccentric cardinal locations (M. Carrasco, A. M. Giordano, & B. McElree, 2004), we hypothesized that the contribution of attention to ILM would follow the same pattern. We characterized psychometric functions of perceived line motion direction, for 1. 5 - stimuli with varying amounts of physical line motion (8 levels) at four cardinal locations. We used three cue conditions to separate the effects of attention from low-level motionVa single cue to draw focal attention to the stimulus location, a distributed cue with elements near all four possible stimulus locations, and no visual cue. Distributed and single cues generate identical effects along the horizontal meridian, but {{the effect of the}} single cue is progressively greater along the vertical meridian, more so at the top location (“North”). We conclude that the low-level motion explanation accounts {{for the majority of the}} canonical example of the ILM (line preceded by a single dot) effect used in our study...|$|R
40|$|Observing actions {{performed}} by others can activate the corresponding motor representations {{in the primary}} motor cortex (M 1), the so-called direct matching. However, it has been proved that in interactive social contexts this imitative tendency could turn into readiness to perform a dissimilar complementary action. To date, {{whether or not the}} observation-execution transformation is automatic (i. e. occurs without attention) is debated. In the present study we aim to bring an increase in the literature by assessing the role of spatial attention during observation of social and non social actions. The stimuli used were action sequences eliciting (or not) complementary responses (i. e. incongruent to the observed action) and spatial attention was manipulated by means of a red <b>dot</b> <b>cue.</b> First, eye-tracking procedures were used to measure the spontaneous allocation of overt spatial attention during action observation. Second, we combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over M 1 and electromyography recordings to assess the excitability of corticospinal projections to hand muscles while participants were observing the action stimuli. Results show that the allocation of spatial attention towards an observed body part is crucial for direct matching to occur. Conversely, the allocation of spatial attention plays no role when the observed action evokes an interactive complementary motor response. Overall, the present research provides one of the first evidence that social motor preparation is impervious to spatial attentional allocation...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The {{so called}} {{inhibition}} of return (IOR) effect {{refers to a}} bias against returning attention to a location which was previously investigated. Because emotionally salient material {{has the capacity to}} capture and hold attention {{it has been suggested that}} this material may disrupt this otherwise impressively stable phenomenon. METHODS: 40 students participated in the experiment. Black and white schematic drawings of a spider, a butterfly or a cross were used as <b>cues.</b> A black <b>dot,</b> a spider, a butterfly or a cross were used as targets. Participants were required to press a key whenever the target picture appeared. Subsequently, they rated the pictures on valence and arousal. RESULTS: Results showed that the IOR effect remained stable and did not diminish with either fear-related cues or fear-related targets. This data adds strong arguments for the stability of IOR. LIMITATIONS: The spider fearful participants were not diagnosed patients. They still meet the criteria for spider fear but follow-up studies should pursue the same question with a specific focus on participants' levels of anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: This study is a contribution to the debate on how emotions affect or do not affect attentional processes such as the IOR. IOR appears to be a robust phenomenon and the emotional valence of neither the cue nor the emotional valence of the target can override it...|$|R
40|$|There is {{extensive}} {{evidence that}} emotional—especially threatening—stimuli rapidly capture attention. These findings are often {{explained in terms}} of a hard-wired and relatively inflexible fear module. We propose an alternative, more flexible mechanism, arguing that motivational relevance is the crucial factor driving rapid attentional orienting. To test our hypothesis, we endowed initially neutral face stimuli with relevance by randomly assigning them to a social in-group or out-group during a 1 -min learning phase, and used these faces as <b>cues</b> in a <b>dot</b> probe task to measure rapid attentional orienting. Across three experiments, we observed attentional rienting toward faces assigned to the out-group. Initial rapid orienting (after 100 ms, Experiments 1 and 2) was observed only for familiar faces for which group membership was explicitly encoded, suggesting that rapid orienting may be based on affectively charged memory traces. At a later time point (after 500 ms, Experiment 3), attention was deployed toward unfamiliar faces sharing a physical attribute (background color) with the familiar out-group faces, suggesting a more time-consuming on-line appraisal of the stimulus. The amount of attentional bias to out-group faces was correlated with individual differences in the accessibility of group identification. Our findings demonstrate that attentional prioritization mechanisms can be flexibly tuned by a brief learning phase of social identity. This is consistent with the idea that attention mechanisms subserving the selection and prioritization of emotional aspects of the nvironment are not static and hard-wired, but may rapidly adapt to recent changes in motivational contingencies...|$|R
40|$|Humans {{integrate}} auditory {{and visual}} spatial cues to locate objects. Generally, location judgments {{are dominated by}} vision because observers localize an auditory cue close to a visual cue {{even if they have}} been instructed to ignore the latter (ventriloquist effect). A recent model of multisensory integration proposes that the ventriloquist effect is governed by two principles: First, spatially discrepant cues are only integrated if the observer infers that both cues stem from one object (principle of causal inference). Second, if the inference results in an assumption that both cues originate from one object the cues are integrated by weighting them according to their relative reliability (principle of Bayes-optimal cue weighting). Thus, the bimodal estimate of the object`s location has a higher reliability than each of the unisensory estimates per se. In order to test this model, 26 subjects were presented with spatial auditory (HRTF-convolved white noise) and visual <b>cues</b> (cloud of <b>dots).</b> The 5 x 5 x 5 factorial design manipulated (1) the auditory cue location, (2) the visual cue location and (3) the reliability of the visual cue via the width of the cloud of dots. Subjects were instructed to locate the auditory cue while ignoring the visual cue and to judge the spatial unity of both cues. In line with the principle of causal inference results showed that the ventriloquist effect was weaker and unity judgments were reduced for larger audiovisual discrepancies. In case of small spatial discrepancies the ventriloquist effect was weaker at low levels of visual reliability implying a Bayes-optimal strategy of cue weighting only if a common cause of both cues was assumed. A probabilistic model incorporating the principles of causal inference and Bayes-optimal cue weighting accurately fitted the behavioral data. Overall, the pattern of results suggested that both principles describe important processes governing multisensory integration...|$|R
