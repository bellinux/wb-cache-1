5|$|Ben Nevis is {{becoming}} popular with ski mountaineers and boarders. The Red Burn (Allt <b>Coire</b> na h-Urcaire) {{just to the}} North of the tourist path gives the easiest descent, but {{most if not all}} of the easier gullies on the North Face have been skied, as has the slope once adorned by the abseil poles into <b>Coire</b> Leis. No 4 gully is probably the most skied. Although Tower scoop makes it a no-fall zone, Tower Gully {{is becoming}} popular, especially in May and June when there is spring snow.|$|E
5|$|John was succeeded as {{owner of}} Rùm by his son, George (later Sir George). George built Kinloch Castle in 1900 using {{sandstone}} quarried at Annan. The interior boasted an orchestrion that could simulate {{the sounds of}} brass, drum and woodwind, an air-conditioned billiards room, and a jacuzzi. A dam was built on <b>Coire</b> Dubh burn for hydroelectric purposes; the house was the first private home in Scotland, outside of Glasgow, to have an electricity supply.|$|E
5|$|On {{the west}} coast of Scotland, the Cailleach ushers in winter by washing her great plaid (Gaelic: féileadh mòr) in the Gulf of Corryvreckan (Gaelic: <b>Coire</b> Bhreacain - 'cauldron of the plaid'). This process is said to take three days, during which the roar of the coming tempest is heard as far away as twenty miles (32km) inland. When she is finished, her plaid is pure white and snow covers the land.|$|E
5|$|The {{north face}} of Ben Nevis is riven with buttresses, ridges, towers and pinnacles, and {{contains}} many classic scrambles and rock climbs. It is of major importance for British winter climbing, {{with many of}} its routes holding snow often until late April. It {{was one of the}} first places in Scotland to receive the attention of serious mountaineers, with a descent of Tower Ridge in 1892 the earliest documented climbing expedition on the Ben. (It was not climbed from bottom to top for another two years). The Scottish Mountaineering Club's Charles Inglis Clark hut was built below the north face in <b>Coire</b> Leis in 1929. Because of its remote location, it is said to be the only genuine alpine hut in Britain. It remains popular with climbers, especially in winter.|$|E
25|$|A' Bhuidheanach Bheag’s best {{geographical}} {{feature is the}} remote Cama Choire {{on the eastern side}} of the mountain. This is a steep sided valley which cuts deeply into the hill and is drained by the Allt a’ Chama Choire. The <b>coire</b> is well seen from the hill of An Dun above the Gaick Pass. From a geological point of view the most interesting characteristic of the mountain is <b>Coire</b> Mhic-sith on its south-western flank. The <b>coire</b> is a deeply incised, fault-guided valley which has received the attention of geologists, especially the School of Geoscience at the University of Edinburgh who have concluded that the presence of glacial silt and sand in the valley along with a glacial spillway to the adjacent valley of the Edendon Water means that the <b>coire</b> had a large ice dammed lake during the last Ice age. This Proglacial lake drained away when the ice melted but has left evidence similar, but on a lesser scale, to the “parallel roads” in Glen Roy.|$|E
25|$|The {{direct ascent}} of Sgairneach Mhòr {{is not a}} {{difficult}} walk {{as the starting point}} is at the summit of the Drumochter Pass on the A9 road and has a starting altitude of 462 metres. The walk crosses the railway and ascends <b>Coire</b> Dhomhain on a good track on the north bank of the Allt <b>Coire</b> Dhomhain. After approximately two km the track is left and the burn is crossed (no bridge) to its southern bank. It is then a walk south through pathless heather to reach the eastern ridge which is followed to the summit. If the burn is in spate then an alternative is to walk higher up into <b>Coire</b> Dhomhain and then ascend by the steeper northern ridge.|$|E
25|$|Beinn a’ Chroin is {{surrounded}} by four other Munros which lie round the head waters of the River Falloch, {{to the north and}} east lies Cruach Ardrain and Beinn Tulaichean which can be reached by an arduous journey contouring round <b>Coire</b> Earb and climbing the subsidiary top of Stob Glas. The other two Munros, An Caisteal and Beinn Chabhair can be attained by following the west ridge down to the Beallach Buidhe from here the continuation to An Caisteal is up steep slopes to the north west. To reach Beinn Chabhair there is further descending to the west to reach an unnamed col (609 metres) before ascending to the summit. The impressive <b>Coire</b> Earb stands {{on the north side of}} the mountain, this corrie gives fine examples of boulder fields and moraine as a result of glacial action from the last Ice age. The smaller <b>Coire</b> a’ Chroin lies on the upper southern slopes and contains the small Lochan a’ Chroin. Drainage from the mountain reaches both coasts of Scotland with the River Falloch going west from <b>Coire</b> Earb to the Firth of Clyde while all other rainfall goes east to the Firth of Forth.|$|E
25|$|Ben Oss is {{especially}} craggy on its northern face, falling away steeply to the Cononish valley and barring any direct approach from this direction. It has two main ridges which {{connect to the}} adjacent Munros of Ben Lui and Beinn Dubhchraig and walkers usually arrive at the mountains summit along either of these. One ridge goes north east, east and then south east to form a curving edge around <b>Coire</b> Garbh connecting to Beinn Dubhchraig at the Bealach Buidhe with a height of 779 metres. <b>Coire</b> Garbh has Loch Oss lying within its recesses, {{a body of water}} measuring roughly 500 by 300 metres. <b>Coire</b> Buidhe stands on the northern side of this eastern ridge, this has a steep headwall and descents north from the bealach to the Cononish valley are not recommended.|$|E
25|$|The eastern ridge {{connects to}} the {{adjacent}} Corbett of The Sow of Atholl, and is narrow near the summit as it goes round the rim of <b>Coire</b> Creagach before broadening as it drops in easy angled slopes to a col with a height of approximately 650 metres. This eastern ridge {{is one of the}} main routes of ascent. The NE ridge is another possible route of ascent from upper <b>Coire</b> Dhomhain although its slopes are steep and rough in places. The hills western flank consist of broad slopes which contour around the head of <b>Coire</b> Dhomhain and descend to a col which links to the adjacent Munro of Beinn Udlamain. All drainage from the mountain goes south via the rivers Garry and Tummel to join the drainage basin of the River Tay and reaching the east coast at the Firth of Tay.|$|E
25|$|Beinn a’ Chaorainn is {{basically}} a north-south orientated ridge which looks quite an undistinguished bulk when viewed from Roughburn (see picture), the best view of the mountain being from the east where the crags of <b>Coire</b> na h-Uamha give the mountain some character. This corrie’s name translates as the Corrie of the Cave although no significant cave is known in its environs although there are several small lochans within its higher recesses. It is drained by the Allt na h-Uamha whose glen separates the mountain from Creag Meagaidh massif to the east. Part of these eastern flanks of the mountain are clothed in coniferous woodland below the 550 metre contour. <b>Coire</b> na h-Uamha is split into two distinctive parts by an eastern ridge which gives a feasible route of ascent from {{the foot of the}} <b>coire</b> directly to the main summit, however some care is needed and in Winter conditions it is ranked as a Grade I Winter route.|$|E
25|$|All {{drainage}} from Aonach Meadhoin goes to {{the east}} coast of Scotland, over 70 kilometres distant, even though the mountain only stands 15 kilometres from Loch Duich on the west coast. The mountain's two main corries are major gathering grounds for Scottish rivers. To the north <b>Coire</b> nan Eun {{is the source of the}} River Affric which eventually finds its way to the Beauly Firth, while to the south <b>Coire</b> na Cadha supplies much of the water for the hydro reservoir of Loch Cluanie, eventually reaching the Moray Firth via the River Moriston and Loch Ness.|$|E
25|$|The {{summit of}} Càrn Mairg is steep sided, partly craggy and {{is made up}} of greyish {{quartzite}} stones. South west of the summit are steep slopes which fall to the head of <b>Coire</b> Chearcaill which is drained by the Allt <b>Coire</b> a' Chearcaill, a tributary of the Invervar Burn and contains an old stalkers bothy on its lower north bank. The northern slopes fall to the glen containing Loch Rannoch and Loch Tummel while to the north east is Gleann Mòr which separates the mountain from Schiehallion which is four km distant. All drainage from the mountain feeds the River Tay either going north and then via the River Tummel or south and via the River Lyon.|$|E
25|$|Five other days, two between <b>coirë</b> and tuilë {{and three}} between yávië and quellë, meant the {{calendar}} {{added up to}} 365 days. Irregularities were allowed for by adding another three days every twelve years, except {{the last year of}} a yén.|$|E
25|$|The Sow of Atholl (also {{known as}} Meall an Dobharchain) is a Scottish hill which is {{situated}} 27 kilometres WNW {{of the town}} of Blair Atholl in Perth and Kinross council area. It stands on the western side of the Pass of Drumochter in a group of hills which lie around <b>Coire</b> Dhomhain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coire</b> Buidhe (Yellow <b>Coire)</b> {{stands at}} the {{northern}} end of the mountain, this corrie is drained by the Burn of Algie, part of the headwaters of the River Roy. Two routes down the ridges on either side of this corrie connects to the adjoining Munros. One route goes NW and links to Beinn Teallach at a col with a height of 614 metres. The other route goes NE down to the Bealach a’ Bharnish (824 metres) before ascending onto the Creag Meagaidh plateau. The southern flank of the mountain descends to Glen Spean with more coniferous plantations below 400 metres while the western flanks are very steep as they fall to the glen of the Allt a’ Chaorainn. All drainage from the mountain finds its way to the west coast of Scotland via the River Spean, going either south directly to Glen Spean or north and going via Glen Roy before joining the Spean at Roybridge.|$|E
25|$|The {{mountains}} finest {{geographical feature}} is the north face a precipitous rock wall which shows off the mountains layered geology when viewed from a distance. These crags rise over 400 metres from the shore of Loch <b>Coire</b> an Ruaidh-staic and have received the attention of rock climbers with Tom Patey and Chris Bonington pioneering a 180 metre long route in 1960.|$|E
25|$|The chief {{towns of}} Raetia (excluding Vindelicia) were Tridentum (Trento) and Curia (<b>Coire</b> or Chur). It was traversed by two great lines of Roman roads — the Via Claudia Augusta leading from Verona and Tridentum across the Reschen Pass to the Fern Pass and thence to Augusta Vindelicorum (Augsburg), {{the other from}} Brigantium (Bregenz) on Lake Constance by Chur and Chiavenna to Como and Milan.|$|E
25|$|The head of <b>Coire</b> Ardrain {{contains}} Y Gully, a scrambler's route {{which leads}} {{directly to the}} summit and gives a fine ice climb (grade 1) in winter. Y Gully made the mountain popular with the early pioneers who enjoyed a challenging route to any summit. Another well known ice climb on the mountain is Hollow Gully which {{is located on the}} rocky spur of Stob Glas (c.820 metres) which lies 1km south-southwest of the main summit.|$|E
25|$|Beinn a’ Chuallaich’s large bulk {{dominates the}} village of Kinloch Rannoch and {{contains}} several long ridges and two significant corries. The longest of the ridges goes north and then NE taking in the subsidiary top of Meall nan Eun (852 metres) before broadening and descending NE to the shores of Loch Errochty. The top of Meall nan Eun {{is marked by a}} ring of stones and gives a fine view of Loch Errochty which is not visible from the main summit. Loch na Caillich stands on this NE ridge at a height of around 700 metres and is a well known gathering point for deer with Charles Plumb describing it as a place “where the deer love to wallow”. <b>Coire</b> Odhar on {{the eastern side of the}} hill is ringed by cliffs which fall from the summit, the corrie itself contains some very large detached boulders. The western corrie, known as <b>Coire</b> Labhrainn is drained by the Allt Mòr which is a fine sight after heavy rain as it roars through the woodland above Kinloch Rannoch and through the village to join the River Tummel. All drainage from the mountain joins the River Tay eventually either going by Glen Errochty or Strath Tummel. Some of the streams on the eastern side of the hill have been diverted into the Errochty catchwater as part of the Tummel hydro-electric power scheme.|$|E
25|$|The {{ascent of}} Sgairneach Mhòr can be {{combined}} {{with any of the}} other three hills which stand around the glen of the Allt <b>Coire</b> Dhomhain. The SMCs Munro handbook recommends climbing it with Beinn Udlamain, however the high starting altitude at Drumochter Pass means a complete traverse around the valley including the hills of The Sow of Atholl, Sgairneach Mhòr, Beinn Udlamain and A' Mharconaich is not an over strenuous day. The highlight of the view from the summit is to the west where there is an excellent view of the Ben Alder group of mountains.|$|E
25|$|Aonach Meadhoin {{reaches a}} height of 1001 metres (3284feet) and along with the Munros of Saileag and Sgùrr a' Bhealaich Dheirg it forms a group of {{mountains}} {{sometimes referred to as}} the North Glen Shiel Ridge. The group are also known as the “Brothers of Kintail” in a nodding acquaintance to the better known Five Sisters of Kintail just to the north west. The mountain's name translates from Gaelic as Middle Ridge, the mountain is shaped like a horseshoe with the summit ridge lying centrally between the two ridges on either side of <b>Coire</b> na Cadha which lies between the mountain and the A87 road two kilometres to the south.|$|E
25|$|Cruach Ardrain’s Y {{shape is}} formed by three ridges which go north, north west and south. The {{southern}} ridge {{links to the}} adjoining Munro of Beinn Tulaichean which lies two kilometres away across a high col at 825 metres. Cruach Ardrain and Beinn Tulaichean are often climbed {{together in the same}} walk. A spur goes south west off the south ridge to the subsidiary top of Stob Glas (815 metres) before continuing to link with the Munro of Beinn a' Chroin, however care is needed as Stob Glas is steep and rocky. The north and north east ridges encircle the extensive <b>Coire</b> Ardrain which is rocky at its head and forested on its lower slopes.|$|E
25|$|Beinn a’ Chroin stands {{well into}} the {{interior}} of the Crianlarich group of seven munros and so it is usually climbed with other hills in the area, more often than not it is ascended with An Caisteal which lies 1.5 kilometres to the north west across the Bealach Buidhe (805 metres). The hill is well seen from the upper part of Glen Falloch from where the long summit ridge and the steep head wall of <b>Coire</b> Earb can be appreciated. The translation of the mountains name from the Gaelic language is vague and there are three possible meanings. Some sources give the translation as “Hill of Danger” although Beinn a’ Chroin is no more dangerous than any other peak in the group. Other sources give the meaning as “Hill of the Sheep Fold” while others give it as “Hill of the Cloven Hoof” referring to the mountains twin summits.|$|E
25|$|Cruach Ardrain {{is clearly}} {{delineated}} {{to the west}} by the upper valley of the River Falloch (<b>Coire</b> Earb) and to the east by the Benmore and Inverlochlarig glens {{and is one of}} the more distinctive of the group of mountains that stand in Glen Falloch. It has a fine pointed outline and is a well seen from the village of Crianlarich with which it is closely associated. A popular horseshoe ridge walk taking in the mountain starts and finishes in the village. Cruach Ardrain is Y shaped and reaches a height of 1046 metres (3432feet). The hills name originate from the Gaelic language and its exact meaning is vague and has various translations into English. One popular version being “The High Heap” however Cruach more usually means a stack, giving an alternative translation of “Stack of the High Part”. The name has also been translated in guide books as “High Mound” and “High Slopes”.|$|E
500|$|The {{western and}} {{southern}} flanks of Ben Nevis rise [...] in about [...] {{from the floor}} of Glen Nevis– the longest and steepest hill slope in Britain– with the result that the mountain presents an aspect of massive bulk on this side. To the north, by contrast, cliffs drop some [...] to <b>Coire</b> Leis (pronounced Koruh Laysh.) A descent of 200 meters from this corrie leads to the Charles Inglis Clark Memorial Hut (known as the CIC Hut), a private mountain hut located at [...] above sea level, owned by the Scottish Mountaineering Club and used as a base for the many climbing routes on the mountain's north face. The hut is situated just above the confluence of Allt a' Mhuilinn and Allt <b>Coire</b> na Ciste.|$|E
500|$|The A82 enters bleak moorland at {{the western}} fringes of Rannoch Moor, {{to the north of}} Tyndrum. The road climbs uphill across the moor and reaches a peak height of [...] near Beinn Chaorach, the highest overall point on the A82. It meets the old Military Road near the Kingshouse Hotel next to the River Etive, and the road turns westward past Buachaille Etive Mòr down Glen Coe towards Glencoe village. This section of the A82 has been said to contain some of the most {{spectacular}} scenery in Scotland. The Guardians Simon Warren described it as [...] "the most beautiful and spectacular location in the whole of Britain", though recent concern has been raised over the proliferation of tourist traffic. Coaches and HGVs in particular have caused significant problems with congestion. The road descends the Pass of Glen Coe and crosses the scenic waterfalls at the Meeting of the Three Waters. This section was the location for several outdoor shots in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, most notably the [...] "Gorge of Eternal Peril" [...] scene. Near the waterfalls is a footpath up to <b>Coire</b> Gabhall, the [...] "lost valley" [...] of Glencoe, where the Clan Donald hid stolen cattle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{avalanche}} {{occurred in}} the <b>Coire</b> na Tulaich area of the mountain. <b>Coire</b> na Tulaich affords a relatively easy (but steep) ascent of the mountain in summer conditions and is also the main ascent route for hill walkers. [...] This corrie {{has a history of}} previous avalanches. The last fatal avalanche before this incident occurred in February 1995, resulting in the deaths of at least six people.|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{starting}} {{points for the}} direct ascent of A' Mharconaich and several permutations if it is being climbed {{in conjunction with other}} hills as it usually is. One route starts on the A9 {{at the top of the}} Pass of Drumochter at grid reference [...] and goes up <b>Coire</b> Dhomhain for just over a kilometre and then ascending NW to the col between A' Mharconaich and the Boar of Badenoch from where the line of fence posts is followed steeply to the summit ridge. This starting point can be used for a complete circuit of <b>Coire</b> Dhomhain taking in the other two Munros of Sgairneach Mhòr and Beinn Udlamain.|$|E
2500|$|Pēdīcāre {{is often}} {{thought to be}} a Greek loanword in Latin (from the noun [...] (paidika) [...] "boyfriend"), but the long [...] "i" [...] is an obstacle. Other more neutral {{synonyms}} for futuō in Latin include coeō, <b>coīre,</b> literally [...] "to go with," [...] whence Latin and English coitus.|$|E
2500|$|Aonach Meadhoin’s {{north and}} south faces are steep as they drop to the corries of <b>Coire</b> nan Eun (north) and <b>Coire</b> na Cadha (south); the {{northern}} face is craggy and holds snow well into summer. The mountain {{is made up of}} three main ridges which radiate from its summit; the western ridge connects to the adjoining Munro of Sgùrr a' Bhealaich Dheirg which lies two kilometres away. Another ridge goes north east for a kilometre to the subsidiary “Top” of Sgùrr an Fhuarail (Peak of the Cold Place) [...] where it splits, the northern spur going for 2.5 kilometres to the Munro of Ciste Dhubh, while the south eastern ridge descends to the Cluanie Inn on the A87. Sgùrr an Fhuarail reaches a height of 987 metres (3238feet) and is listed in the Munro Tables as a “Top” of Aonach Meadhoin. It is a fine viewpoint towards the east including an aerial view of Loch Cluanie, which is better than from the main summit.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in 1960 {{an area in}} {{the rugged}} Northern Corries between Aviemore and Cairn Gorm was {{developed}} for skiing. A road was constructed to a height of [...] in <b>Coire</b> Cas where a ski centre was built and ski lifts and tows were installed, one going up to a new restaurant, the Ptarmigan, at [...] In good weather {{it was an easy}} stroll from there to the Cairngorm Plateau.|$|E
2500|$|The {{summit is}} {{littered}} with quartzite boulders with the highest point marked by a cairn of rocks and gives a view which includes the Skye Cuillin to the SW, Upper Loch Torridon appears next to Beinn Damh to the NW while the Torridon hills are further round to the [...] north. By exploring the summit plateau further {{it is possible to}} look 1000 feet down the cliffs of the north face to Loch <b>Coire</b> an Ruaidh-staic.|$|E
2500|$|Sgairneach Mhòr has {{extensive}} southern slopes {{which include}} the subsidiary tops of Màm Bàn (919 metres) and Meallan Buidhe (879 metres) and descend to the glen of the Allt Shallainn which is the main tributary of Loch Garry. Two distinct ridges go north and east from the summit enclosing <b>Coire</b> Creagach which is rocky but not overly steep giving a sporting scramble to the summit. The summit of the mountain is a SW-NE orientated plateau with the highest point never in doubt, standing at the NE end {{close to the edge}} of <b>Coire</b> Creagach and being marked by an OS trig point surrounded by a low stone built wind shelter. The summit of the mountain was given as 500 metres SW of the present position in the original 1891 version of Munro's Tables, due to the limitations of the available mapping. [...] This position (marked by a cairn) measures only 963 metres in altitude, almost 30 metres lower than the true summit. [...] The correct position was noted in the 1921 edition of the Tables. [...] However the 1974 edition, the first to give grid references, gives the old position, doubtless an oversight.|$|E
2500|$|A' Bhuidheanach Bheag {{is usually}} climbed from the A9 road, {{there are two}} {{possible}} starting points, Balsporan Cottages (...) or 1.5km to the north {{at the foot of}} <b>Coire</b> Chuirn. A more interesting route starts from the secluded country to the east at the ruined Sronphadruig Lodge and ascends by the Cama Choire to reach the plateau. Many walkers will continue to the adjacent Munro of Càrn na Caim, the plateau is quite featureless and a map and compass is necessary in misty conditions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most popular}} route of ascent starts at Roughburn on the A86 at grid {{reference}} , there is parking at the Loch Laggan Dam, 700 metres to the SW. Forest roads and fire breaks take the walker {{through the forest}} to emerge onto the open hillside at a height of 400 metres. The route then goes NE up a broad ridge {{on the west side}} of the shallow <b>Coire</b> Clachaig. The view from the summit gives an excellent perspective of the Munros around Loch Treig.|$|E
2500|$|Beinn a’ Chuallaich {{is usually}} ascended {{from the south}} or the east. From the south there are routes from Kinloch Rannoch and Drumglas. From Kinloch Rannoch the route goes up the Allt Mòr, passing a fine {{waterfall}} before going steep up to the summit ridge. The route from Drumglas is the most direct and utilises the SE ridge. An approach from the east starts from the B847 road at grid reference [...] and goes past a bothy and a deer fence before going steeply up to climb <b>Coire</b> Odhar and reach the summit.|$|E
