The strategy {{was developed in}} small, private agency contexts utilizing comprehensive and intensive services; how and with what success concurrent planning concepts have been implemented by large public child welfare bureaucracies is not known. This study examines the implementation of concurrent planning in six county child welfare agencies in a large western state. Quantitative data were extracted from case files of a sample of 885 children entering out-of-home care before and after implementation of <b>concurrent</b> planning <b>legislation.</b> Interviews and focus groups with 180 individuals (including agency social workers, supervisors, and court personnel) from the same counties contextualize these findings. Results from the study help to identify factors that may facilitate or hinder successful implementation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Minnesota Child Development Inventory (MCDI) {{was used}} to {{describe}} the developmental status of 59 children before the start of kindergarten. Three years later children were classified in one of four categories, based on the amount of supplemental reading instruction necessary during the three-year period. A number of variables from the MCDI were highly correlated with this continuum of difficulty in mastering reading, with parental report of the child's general development and knowledge of letters and numbers being most signifi-cant. Significant correlations with group achievement tests also were obtained. The findings should encourage the inclusion of parent reports by persons using or constructing preschool screening measures. With increased special education legislation, most recently PL 94 - 142, increased pressure has been placed on educators to provide screening programs to identify children likely to experience difficulty in mastering basic school tasks. Such pressures have been complicated by <b>concurrent</b> <b>legislation</b> in the health-screening area, with provisions for early and periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment for physical and mental defects being made available to families from poverty or culturally disadvantaged backgrounds. Whereas there is little need to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and the associated implications for early intervention or remediation or both, there is much contro-versy over primary goals and means for carrying out such screening and intervention programs (Bower, 1978). This controversy has {{led to the development of}} valid and reliable screening instruments that can be used economically to screen large numbers of children. With regard to the general area of reading, the risk population is sub-stantial, with 15 % of school-aged children estimated to experience difficulty in learning to read (National Advisory Committee o...|$|E
40|$|Background: This {{research}} {{focuses on}} pharmaceutical competition in South Africa where <b>concurrent</b> pricing <b>legislation</b> is being implemented without monitoring the consequences on generic drug competition and usage. Objective: To {{examine the relationship between}} originator drug prices and the number of generic brands within the cardiovascular class of drugs and to compare South African prices with international reference prices. Method: Data on private sector drug prices was sourced from the South African Medicine Price Registry. The relationship between the median proportional price and the number of brands in the therapeutic class was analysed using correlation analysis. International reference prices were obtained from the Management Sciences for Health International Drug Price Indicator Guide (2012 edition). Results: A weak correlation between originator and generic drug prices and the number of available brands was observed, the exception being diuretic drugs. The median prices per strength of the originator generic were still higher than the most expensive generic version manufactured by any other company, the exception being telmisartan. Comparison of price ratios between the originator drug, lowest priced generic and international reference price values revealed that the originator drug prices had a median price ratio of 20. 99 (interquartile range 7. 31 – 53. 46) and the lowest priced generics had a median price ratio of 4. 28 (interquartile range 2. 10 – 8. 47). Conclusion: Increased generic competition is not a predictor of lower drug prices. The study also concludes that the current South African pharmaceutical policies have not yet achieved the lowest prices for drugs when compared internationally...|$|R

40|$|The book {{contains}} {{a full and}} up-to-date account {{of the implications of}} concurrent enforcement of EC and UK competition law. It addresses the interaction of criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings in the UK and the EU as regards procedure, evidence, and remedies. The volume {{contains a}}n in-depth examination of the principles regulating concurrent proceedings and explains in detail the practical solutions following from the construction of EU and UK <b>legislation.</b> <b>Concurrent</b> Proceedings in Competition Law offers a thorough review of the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance and the European Court of Human Rights, as well as analysing the English authorities in the area of procedure and evidence insofar as relevant to the interplay between criminal, civil and administrative proceedings in competition law. The main focus is on stays, binding effect of administrative decisions and judgments, and disclosure and admissibility of evidence in English law and its relationship with Community Law and Human Rights standards. The analysis expands to the practical consequences of case allocation within the European Competition Network, choice of forum within the EU, litigation in the US, and leniency applications in multiple jurisdictions. The impact of Council Regulation 1 / 2003 and the Commission Notices on cooperation within the Network of Competition Authorities and on cooperation with the courts of EU member states is fully explored. Criminalization of cartels in the UK adds a further dimension to the interplay of concurrent proceedings. Issues of stays, binding effect of administrative decisions and disclosure and admissibility of evidence are also studied when they arise in a dispute that is being decided by an arbitral tribunal...|$|R
40|$|United or Disunited? The Regional Question and {{the issue}} of Federalism in Italy - This article deals with Italy’s {{regional}} crisis arising from the petitions – filed in the country over the last years – in favour of a transformation from the Italian centralized unitary system into a Federal form of government. 	This work reconstructs the origins of the regional question and its political-administrative decentralization since the Unity of Italy. It focuses mainly on the territorial responses and the high points of the debate developing during the XIX century between “Unitarians” and “Federalists”. In particular, we discuss Carlo Cattaneo’s argument over the creation of an actual autonomy of territorial communities generating the construction of the United Kingdoms of Italy. 	Outlining the genesis and the evolution of the Italian regions as space of government, this paper aims at identifying the practices of distribution, largely spread by cartographic representations. Moreover, it takes into consideration the persistence of such regional designs in Italians’ collective imagination. Finally, it reconstructs the basic events of Italian regions – a process delayed for several years – from the Union to Fascism, to the second post-war period, until their actual institution in the Seventies. 	At the turn of the 20 th and 21 st centuries, following the crisis caused by “Tangentopoli” (aka bribesville), Northern League movements and Berlusconi ‘personal party’ began to gain ground powerfully. In 2001, the changing political scene led to the approval of a constitutional amendment, introducing a <b>concurrent</b> <b>legislation</b> between State and Regions. The new legal frameworks resulting from a partial institutional revision in Italy can also be seen as the consequence of a controversial regionalization, opposing the historical “Southern question” to the merging of a new “Northern question”. Finally, the work questions some fundamental issues emerging from the difficult transition from a Regional State to a Federal one, in this contemporary late-capitalist critical age...|$|E
