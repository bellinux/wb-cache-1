This article presents detailed analyses of two such machining strategies with regard to the process force direction.

50|$|A plate nut, {{also known}} as a nut plate, anchor nut or anchor plate, is a stamped sheet metal nut that is usually riveted to a workpiece. They have a long tube that is {{internally}} threaded and a plate with two <b>clearance</b> <b>holes</b> <b>for</b> rivets. The most popular versions have two lugs and they exist as fixed anchor nuts and as floating anchor nuts. The latter allows the nut to move slightly and so enlarges the positioning tolerances of the mounted parts. They were originally developed for the aerospace industry, but are now also common in automotive racing.These nuts are made up of variety of soft and hard materials. The choice of material depends on environment to which nut is subjected. Soft materials like copper or brass are used when nut is used in electrical application. Hard materials are used when nut is subjected to high stress environment. Sometimes stainless steel or nickel-plated nuts are used in order to increase corrosion resistance.|$|R
50|$|After {{experimenting with}} new ideas in his home workshop, Hornby began making toys for his sons in 1899 with pieces he cut from sheet metal. He built models of bridges, trucks and cranes, {{although}} the pieces they were made from were not interchangeable. The breakthrough came when Hornby realised {{that if he could}} make separate, interchangeable parts that could be bolted together, any model could be built from the same components. The key inventive step was the realisation that regular perforations in the structural pieces could be used, not only to join them together with nuts and bolts, but also to journal - act as a bearing for - axles and shafts. This made the construction of complex mechanisms relatively simple. He started making metal strips by hand from copper sheets. The strips were half an inch wide with <b>holes</b> <b>for</b> <b>bolts</b> spaced at half inch intervals. Initially he made the nuts and bolts himself, but he soon found an alternate source of supply.|$|R

The survey provides an initial experimental analysis of the possible crisis mechanisms, taking into account the recent findings related to the behavior of all FRP beam-column joints, to the orthotropy of the material and to the effect of the holes. This experimental based approach is then compared with the Withney-Nuismer model on assessing the effect of the holes in orthotropic plates with respect to the determination of the strength values. The comparison regards also the criterion of Strain Energy Density on the trigger and the propagation of the crack phenomenon. The study concludes with an analysis of the new cracks and mixed modes of failure with respect to cracks and modes of crisis already known in the literature...|$|R

40|$|Many deep <b>holes</b> <b>for</b> <b>bolt</b> joints {{are often}} {{required}} for consumption using a large dimension structural glued laminated timber. In deep machine-boring {{of this type}} of timber, axial deviation of the hole frequently occures, and causes difficulty in the bolt joint operation. Therefore, the development of machine boring which prevents axial deviation of hole is important. The objective {{of this study was to}} obtain basic information on axial deviation of hole in the deep machine-boring of wood. In this experiment, the effects of knots and bit wear on axial deviation of the hole were examined, and acoustic emission (AE) and power consumption were also measured during the boring process. The main results obtained are as follows: Axial deviation of hole was affected by the annual rings, and became larger with increasing bit wear. In workpieces which had a loose knot, all deep holes deviated in the direction of the loose knot. The average value of both the AE and power consumption became larger with increasing feed per revolution. For the other hand, the average value of the AE were almost unaffected by bit wear, and the average value of power consumption increased slightly by bit wear. A correspondance between axial deviation of hole and the AE or power consumption was not recognized...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Large interfragmentary {{movements}} may delay bone-healing. The {{hypothesis of}} the present study was that a reduction of interfragmentary movements, especially of torsional rotation and bending angles, would support the healing process and lead to improved healing following unreamed tibial nailing. The objective of this study was to investigate healing of an unstable tibial osteotomy site following stabilization with unreamed nailing with a modified tibial device that had angle stable <b>holes</b> <b>for</b> the locking <b>bolts.</b> We compared those findings with healing after stabilization of such sites with standard unreamed tibial nailing. The duration of the study period was nine weeks. METHODS: The site of a standardized displaced osteotomy (3 -mm gap) in twelve ovine tibiae was stabilized with unreamed tibial nailing: six animals were treated with a modified nail that had angle stable <b>holes</b> <b>for</b> the locking <b>bolts,</b> and six were treated with standard unreamed tibial nailing. In vivo gait analysis with optical measurements of interfragmentary movements and simultaneous measurements of ground reaction parameters were performed three days after the operation and once weekly afterward. After the animals were killed at nine weeks, the treated and contralateral tibiae were explanted, the implants were removed, and radiographs were made and evaluated for bridged cortices. Each pair of tibiae was also mechanically tested until torsional failure, after which the whole callus region was subjected to histological and histomorphometric analysis. RESULTS: Throughout the examination period, the interfragmentary movements in all directions were significantly smaller in the group treated with the angle stable tibial nail than they were in the group treated with standard unreamed tibial nailing. The limbs treated with the angle stable tibial nails returned to almost full weight-bearing during the period of the investigation, whereas those treated with standard nailing did not. Histomorphometric analysis, radiographic data, and mechanical testing showed superior bone-healing following treatment with the angle stable tibial nail. CONCLUSIONS: Use of an angle stable tibial nail may help to reduce interfragmentary movements in vivo and thus lead to superior bone-healing compared with that following standard unreamed tibial nailing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this work, a new {{technique}} for enhancement of fatigue life of bolt-nut connections is introduced. In this technique, the threaded part of the bolt where it comes {{into contact with the}} nut is axially holed. A hole will have two opposite effects; (1) it will reduce the load carrying capacity of the bolt and (2) it will results in a more uniform load distribution. It {{is the subject of this}} investigation to find the optimum size of the <b>hole</b> <b>for</b> a specific <b>bolt</b> diameter. It is evident that a too small hole will have no significant effect on fatigue load and a too large hole, despite reducing the load concentration, will reduce the load capacity of the connection too. In this work, the metric bolt, M 16 was selected for the experiments. Five diameters of 4, 5, 6 and 8 mm were examined in this work. The experiments were conducted under the load levels of 50 to 120 kN. The results suggest (i) the fatigue life remarkably increases <b>for</b> the <b>holed</b> specimens provided the optimum value <b>for</b> the <b>hole</b> diameter is determined and (ii) the increase in fatigue life reduces as the load increases...|$|R

And as, {{under the}} shadow of these nodding leaves, we bid {{farewell}} to the great Gothic spirit, here also we may cease our examination of the details of the Ducal Palace; for above its upper arcade there are only the four traceried windows,[160] and {{one or two of the}} third order on the Rio Façade, which can be depended upon as exhibiting the original workmanship of the older palace. I examined the capitals of the four other windows on the façade, and of those on the Piazzetta, one by one, with great care, and I found them all to be of far inferior workmanship to those which retain their traceries: I believe the stone framework of these windows must have been so cracked and injured by the flames of the great fire, as to render it necessary to replace it by new traceries; and that the present mouldings and capitals are base imitations of the original ones. The traceries were at first, however, restored in their complete form, as the <b>holes</b> <b>for</b> the <b>bolts</b> which fastened the bases of their shafts are still to be seen in the window-sills, as well as the marks of the inner mouldings on the soffits. How much the stone facing of the façade, the parapets, and the shafts and niches of the angles, retain of their original masonry, it is also impossible to determine; but there is nothing in the workmanship of any of them demanding especial notice; still less in the large central windows on each façade, which are entirely of Renaissance execution. All that is admirable in these portions of the building is the disposition of their various parts and masses, which is without doubt the same as in the original fabric, and calculated, when seen from a distance, to produce the same impression.|$|R

The uniaxial symmetry non-circular hole is optimized based on finite element method (FEM), in which the maximum first principal stress is taken as the objective function.

40|$|High-power {{ultrasonic}} actuators {{are generally}} assembled with a horn, backing, stress bolt, piezoelectric rings, and electrodes. The manufacturing process is complex, expensive, difficult, and time-consuming. The internal stress bolt {{needs to be}} insulated and presents a potential internal discharge point, which can decrease actuator life. Also, {{the introduction of a}} center <b>hole</b> <b>for</b> the <b>bolt</b> causes many failures, reducing the throughput of the manufactured actuators. A new design has been developed for producing ultrasonic horn actuators. This design consists of using flexures rather than stress bolts, allowing one to apply pre-load to the piezoelectric material. It also allows one to manufacture them from a single material/plate, rapid prototype them, or make an array in a plate or 3 D structure. The actuator is easily assembled, and application of pre-stress greater than 25 MPa was demonstrated. The horn consists of external flexures that eliminate the need for the conventional stress bolt internal to the piezoelectric, and reduces the related complexity. The stress bolts are required in existing horns to provide prestress on piezoelectric stacks when driven at high power levels. In addition, the manufacturing process benefits from the amenability to produce horn structures with internal cavities. The removal of the pre-stress bolt removes a potential internal electric discharge point in the actuator. In addition, it significantly reduces the chances of mechanical failure in the piezoelectric stacks that result from the hole surface in conventional piezoelectric actuators. The novel features of this disclosure are: 1. A design that can be manufactured from a single piece of metal using EDM, precision machining, or rapid prototyping. 2. Increased electromechanical coupling of the horn actuator. 3. Higher energy density. 4. A monolithic structure of a horn that consists of an external flexure or flexures {{that can be used to}} pre-stress a solid piezoelectric structure rather than a bolt, which requires a through hole in the piezoelectric material. 5.
