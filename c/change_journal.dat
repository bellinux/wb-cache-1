2500|$|The Windows Search service {{provides}} the Notifications API component to allow applications to [...] "push" [...] changed items that need indexing to the Windows Search indexer. Applications use the component {{to supply the}} URIs of the items {{that need to be}} indexed, and the URIs are written to the Gather Queue, where they are read off by the indexer. Microsoft Office Outlook 2007, as well as Microsoft Office OneNote 2007 use this ability to index the items managed by them and use Windows Search queries to provide the in-application searching features. The internal USN Journal Notifier component of Windows Search also uses the Notifications API, monitoring the <b>Change</b> <b>Journal</b> in an NTFS volume to keep track of files that have changed on the volume. If the file is in a location indexed by Windows Search and does not have the FANCI (File Attribute Not Content Indexed) attribute set, the Windows Search service is notified of its path via the Notification API.|$|E

40|$|Holonomic quantum {{computation}} {{is the idea}} to use non-Abelian geometric phases to implement universal quantum gates that are robust to fluctuations in control parameters. Here, we propose a compact design for a holonomic quantum computer based on coupled three-level systems.

40|$|We {{develop a}} non-adiabatic {{generalization}} of holonomic quantum computation in which high-speed universal quantum gates {{can be realized}} by using non-Abelian geometric phases. We show how a set of non-adiabatic holonomic one- and two-qubit gates can be implemented by utilizing optical transitions in a generic three-level Î› configuration. Our scheme opens up for universal holonomic quantum computation on qubits characterized by short coherence times. Comment: Some <b>changes,</b> <b>journal</b> reference adde...|$|R
