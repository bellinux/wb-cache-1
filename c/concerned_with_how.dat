5|$|Contemporary {{political}} sociology includes these areas of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists are as likely to be <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions {{in such a way as}} to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E
5|$|In {{opposition}} to the formal theories of the generative school, functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. Formal theories of grammar seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they {{relate to each other}} as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out. The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> the mind creates meaning through language.|$|E
5|$|Much of Durkheim's {{work was}} <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> {{societies}} could maintain their integrity and coherence in modernity; {{an era in}} which traditional social and religious ties are no longer assumed, and in which new social institutions have come into being. His first major sociological work was The Division of Labour in Society (1893). In 1895, he published The Rules of Sociological Method and set up the first European department of sociology, becoming France's first professor of sociology. In 1898, he established the journal L'Année Sociologique. Durkheim's seminal monograph, Suicide (1897), a study of suicide rates in Catholic and Protestant populations, pioneered modern social research and served to distinguish social science from psychology and political philosophy. The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (1912) presented a theory of religion, comparing the social and cultural lives of aboriginal and modern societies.|$|E

30|$|This {{mechanism}} is {{also consistent with}} our findings that HOPE did not {{have a negative effect on}} STEM majors of students who enrolled in two-year schools. Since grading standards at two-year schools are lower, students should have less <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> a STEM major will affect their GPA.|$|R

25|$|Cyto{{genetics}} is {{a branch}} of genetics that is <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> the chromosomes relate to cell behaviour, particularly to their behaviour during mitosis and meiosis. Techniques used include karyotyping, analysis of G-banded chromosomes, other cytogenetic banding techniques, as well as molecular cytogenetics such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH).|$|E
25|$|Another {{view is that}} pure {{mathematics}} is not necessarily applied mathematics: {{it is possible to}} study abstract entities with respect to their intrinsic nature and not be <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> they manifest in the real world. Even though the pure and applied viewpoints are distinct philosophical positions, in practice there is much overlap in the activity of pure and applied mathematicians.|$|E
25|$|Neural coding is <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> sensory {{and other}} {{information}} is represented in the brain by neurons. The main goal of studying neural coding is to characterize {{the relationship between the}} stimulus and the individual or ensemble neuronal responses, and the relationships amongst the electrical activities of the neurons within the ensemble.

25|$|Following British defeats and German successes with Blitzkrieg in {{the early}} months of World War II, Members of Parliament and the British media {{expressed}} <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> the British Army was being led. There was a notable shortage of officers, with a shortfall of 25% meaning that the War Office was unable to properly staff units, and there was a high proportion of breakdowns. In addition, the Army was perceived as old-fashioned and inefficient, as well as tainted by social bias.|$|R
25|$|As these {{constitutional}} developments {{were taking}} place, the Dominion and British governments became increasingly <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> {{to represent the}} more commonly accepted notion {{that there was no}} distinction between the sovereign's role in the United Kingdom and his or her position in any of the Dominions. Thus, at the 1948 Prime Ministers' Conference the term Dominion was avoided in favour of Commonwealth country, {{in order to avoid the}} subordination implied by the older designation.|$|E
25|$|As {{opposed to}} {{iconography}} {{which seeks to}} identify meaning, semiotics is <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> meaning is created. Roland Barthes’s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of denoted meaning—the recognition of a visual sign, and the connoted meaning—the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is {{to come up with}} ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.|$|E
25|$|Common Sense was {{immensely popular}} in {{disseminating}} {{to a very}} wide audience ideas that were already in common use among the elite who comprised Congress and the leadership cadre of the emerging nation, who rarely cited Paine's arguments in their public calls for independence. The pamphlet probably had little direct influence on the Continental Congress' decision to issue a Declaration of Independence, since that body was more <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> declaring independence would affect the war effort. Paine's great contribution was in initiating a public debate about independence which had previously been rather muted.|$|E
50|$|Other {{sources of}} concern {{relate to the}} {{compliance}} of connected toys companies regarding COPPA. The Electronic Privacy Information Center, the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, the Center for Digital Democracy, and Consumers Union submitted a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission regarding how My Friend Cayla and I-Que Intelligent Bot produced by Genesis Toys have violated the laws of COPPA. The complaint mentioned the data sharing between Genesis Toys and Nuance Communications. In addition, it <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> Nuance Communications does not directly mention compliance with COPPA.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{interpretation}} of Kant's argument for transcendental idealism in the Transcendental Aesthetic. I argue against a common way of reading this argument, which sees Kant as arguing that substantive a priori claims about mind-independent reality would be unintelligible because we cannot explain {{the source of their}} justification. I argue that Kant's <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> synthetic a priori propositions are possible is not a <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> the source of their justification, but <b>with</b> <b>how</b> they can have objects. I argue that Kant's notion of intuition needs to be understood as a kind of representation which involves the presence to consciousness of the object it represents, and that this means that a priori intuition cannot present us with a mind-independent feature of reality...|$|R
40|$|In {{this short}} piece, I {{respond to the}} {{invitation}} to write differently about families, relationships and societies by drawing out an anecdotal approach to theorising family time. The anecdote I use highlights the temporal dimensions of family life, and the ways that time can be 'mushed', resisting the rhythms of late-capitalist domestic life. By 'mushing' time, 'the 'kids' in the anecdote propose an alternative undifferentiated experience of communality, which links <b>with</b> wider generational <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> communality may only emerge when narratives of national progress are countered, and attention is turned to 'mush'...|$|R
25|$|Second-language {{acquisition}} classroom {{research is}} an area of research in second-language acquisition <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> people learn languages in educational settings. There is a significant overlap between classroom research and language education. Classroom research is empirical, basing its findings on data and statistics wherever possible. It is also more concerned with what the learners do in the classroom than with what the teacher does. Where language teaching methods may only concentrate on the activities the teacher plans for the class, classroom research concentrates on the effect the things the teacher does has on the students.|$|E
25|$|The {{ascendant}} {{is generally}} considered {{the most important and}} personalized angle in the horoscope by the vast majority of astrologers. It signifies a person's awakening consciousness, {{in the same way that}} the Sun's appearance on the eastern horizon signifies the dawn of a new day. Due to the fact that the ascendant is specific to a particular time and place, it signifies the individual environment and conditioning that a person receives during their upbringing, and also the circumstances of their childhood. For this reason, the ascendant is also <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> a person has learned to present him or herself to the world, especially in public and in impersonal situations.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Mintzberg {{developed}} {{these five}} types of management strategy into 10 “schools of thought” and grouped them into three categories. The first group is normative. It {{consists of the}} schools of informal design and conception, the formal planning, and analytical positioning. The second group, consisting of six schools, is more <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> strategic management is actually done, rather than prescribing optimal plans or positions. The six schools are entrepreneurial, visionary, cognitive, learning/adaptive/emergent, negotiation, corporate culture and business environment. The third and final group consists of one school, the configuration or transformation school, a hybrid of the other schools organized into stages, organizational life cycles, or “episodes”.|$|E

30|$|This topic {{also had}} one of the strongest {{qualitative}} alignment scores between CIMULACT and expert reports, primarily due to the shared concern of data security and to a lesser degree data validation. <b>Concerns</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> personal data was collected, stored, and used were seen as core areas for future research towards ensuring that data could be put to use in a fashion that protected the citizens it was meant to serve. Additionally, both the citizens and experts shared the idea that research and development of modes of data analysis (advanced computing, algorithm design, etc.) were priorities for future R&I policy.|$|R

In highly sophisticated and nuanced critical commentary, they explore how both individual and group identities are shaped in and by one 2 ̆ 7 s cultural environment. At the same time, they recognize that limiting understanding can be an equally powerful influence in the shaping of one 2 ̆ 7 s {{sense of self and}} community. [URL]...|$|R
25|$|Software {{functional}} {{quality is}} defined as conformance to explicitly stated functional requirements, identified for example using Voice of the Customer analysis (part of the Design for Six Sigma toolkit and/or documented through use cases) {{and the level of}} satisfaction experienced by end-users. The latter is referred as to as usability and is <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> intuitive and responsive the user interface is, how easily simple and complex operations can be performed, and how useful error messages are. Typically, software testing practices and tools ensure that a piece of software behaves in compliance with the original design, planned user experience and desired testability, i.e. a piece of software's disposition to support acceptance criteria.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Eric Lenneberg criticised Whorf's {{examples}} from an objectivist view of language holding that languages are principally meant to represent {{events in the}} real world and that even though languages express these ideas in various ways, the meanings of such expressions and therefore the thoughts of the speaker are equivalent. He argued that Whorf's English descriptions of a Hopi speaker's view of time were in fact translations of the Hopi concept into English, therefore disproving linguistic relativity. However Whorf was <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> the habitual use of language influences habitual behavior, rather than translatability. Whorf's point was that while English speakers may be able to understand how a Hopi speaker thinks, they do not think in that way.|$|E
25|$|Environmental {{enrichment}} is <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> {{the brain}} {{is affected by the}} stimulation of its information processing provided by its surroundings (including the opportunity to interact socially). Brains in richer, more-stimulating environments, have increased numbers of synapses, and the dendrite arbors upon which they reside are more complex. This effect happens particularly during neurodevelopment, but also to a lesser degree in adulthood. With extra synapses there is also increased synapse activity and so increased size and number of glial energy-support cells. Capillary vasculation also is greater to provide the neurons and glial cells with extra energy. The neuropil (neurons, glial cells, capillaries, combined together) expands making the cortex thicker. There may also exist (at least in rodents) more neurons.|$|E
50|$|Lenin had {{published}} essays on {{his analysis of}} imperialism, the monopoly and globalisation phase of capitalism as predicted by Marx, as well as analyses on the social conditions of his contemporary time. He observed that as capitalism had further developed in Europe and America, the workers remained unable to gain class consciousness {{so long as they}} were too busy working and <b>concerning</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> to make ends meet. He therefore proposed that the social revolution would require the leadership of a vanguard party of class-conscious revolutionaries from the educated and politically active part of the population.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the main}} goals of the Trump {{administration}} is to lift burdensome regulations from various energy industries to boost domestic energy production. In order to do so appropriately, Trump asked American manufacturers which regulations made production the most difficult. The industry leaders responded, and an overwhelming amount of them recommended lifting restrictions related {{to the environment and}} workers' rights. In an open letter to Scott Pruitt, Mustafa Ali, former head of the EPA's Environmental Justice Program who resigned in protest to Pruitt's budget cuts, expressed <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> the budget cuts will effect pollution in poor and minority neighborhoods.|$|R
