5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} calculates {{the greatest}} common divisor (GCD) of two natural numbers a and b. The {{greatest common divisor}} g is the largest natural number that divides both a and b without leaving a remainder. Synonyms for the GCD include the greatest <b>common</b> <b>factor</b> (GCF), the highest <b>common</b> <b>factor</b> (HCF), the highest common divisor (HCD), and the greatest common measure (GCM). The greatest common divisor is often written as gcd(a,b) or, more simply, as (a,b), although the latter notation is also used for other mathematical concepts, such as two-dimensional vectors.|$|E
5|$|Let g = gcd(a,b). Since a and b {{are both}} {{multiples}} of g, {{they can be}} written a=mg and b=ng, {{and there is no}} larger number G>g for which this is true. The natural numbers m and n must be coprime, since any <b>common</b> <b>factor</b> could be factored out of m and n to make g greater. Thus, any other number c that divides both a and b must also divide g. The greatest common divisor g of a and b is the unique (positive) common divisor of a and b that is divisible by any other common divisor c.|$|E
25|$|The above {{series is}} a {{geometric}} {{series with the}} first term as 1/10 and the <b>common</b> <b>factor</b> 1/10. Because the absolute value of the <b>common</b> <b>factor</b> is less than 1, {{we can say that}} the geometric series converges and find the exact value {{in the form of a}} fraction by using the following formula where a is the first term of the series and r is the <b>common</b> <b>factor.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} criticisms of <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> theory: for example, that <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> theory dismisses {{the need for}} {{specific}} therapeutic techniques or procedures, that <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> {{are nothing more than}} a good therapeutic relationship, and that <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> theory is not scientific. Some <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> theorists have argued that these criticisms are based on a limited knowledge of the <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> literature; a thorough review of the literature shows that a coherent treatment procedure is a crucial medium for the <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> to operate, that most models of <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> define interactions between multiple variables (including but not limited to therapeutic relationship variables), and that some models of <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> provide evidence-based explanations for the mechanisms of the proposed <b>common</b> <b>factors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{first route}} to {{integration}} is called <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> and [...] "seeks {{to determine the}} core ingredients that different therapies share in common" [...] (Norcross, 2005, p. 9). The advantage of a <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> approach is the emphasis on therapeutic actions that have been demonstrated to be effective. The disadvantage is that <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> may overlook specific techniques {{that have been developed}} within particular theories. <b>Common</b> <b>factors</b> have been described by Jerome Frank (Frank & Frank, 1991), Bruce Wampold (2001), and Miller, Duncan and Hubble (2005). <b>Common</b> <b>factors</b> theory asserts it is precisely the <b>factors</b> <b>common</b> to the most psychotherapies that make any psychotherapy successful.|$|R
50|$|Researchers {{have studied}} <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> in detail. Grencavage and Norcross (1990) {{identified}} 35 <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> in published sources. The identified <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> were categorized into five main groups: client characteristics, therapist qualities, change processes, treatment structures and relationship elements. Examples {{of some of}} the <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> included within these broad categories are persuasion, a healing setting, engagement, the use of rituals and techniques, suggestion, and emotional learning. Tracey et al. 2003, examined deeper relationships among the categories and <b>common</b> <b>factors.</b> They concluded that there are two dimensions of therapy: feeling and thinking. Within each of the two dimensions are three clusters: bond, information, and role.|$|R

40|$|The paper proposes {{statistics}} {{to test the}} null hypothesis of no cointegration in panel data when <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> drive the cross sectional dependence. We consider both the case in which regressors are independent of the <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> and the case in which regressors are correlated with the <b>common</b> <b>factors.</b> The proposed test statistics have limiting distributions that are independent of the <b>common</b> <b>factors,</b> {{making it possible to}} pool the individual statistics. Simulations show that the proposed procedures have good finite sample properties. ...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} models of <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> in {{successful}} psychotherapy process and outcome. Already in 1990, Grencavage and Norcross identified 89 <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> in a literature review, which showed {{the diversity of}} models of <b>common</b> <b>factors.</b> To be useful for purposes of psychotherapy practice and training, most models {{reduce the number of}} <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> to a handful, typically around five. Frank listed six <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> in 1971 and explained their interaction. Goldfried and Padawer listed five common strategies or principles in 1982: corrective experiences and new behaviors, feedback from the therapist to the client promoting new understanding in the client, expectation that psychotherapy will be helpful, establishment of the desired therapeutic relationship, and ongoing reality testing by the client. Grencavage and Norcross grouped <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> into five areas in 1990. Lambert formulated four groups of therapeutic factors in 1992. Joel Weinberger and Cristina Rasco listed five <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> in 2007 and reviewed the empirical support for each factor: the therapeutic relationship, expectations of treatment effectiveness, confronting or facing the problem (exposure), mastery or control experiences, and patients' attributions of successful outcome to internal or external causes.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{importance}} of idiosyncratic and <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> in the evolution and volatility of sovereign spreads, with special focus on Chile. Our empirical results {{support the view that}} few <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> explained most of common volatility of sovereign spreads between January 1998 and June 2004. Consistent with a differentiation of international investors based on sovereign ratings, a larger proportion of common volatility of non-investment economies is explained by <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> compared to investments. For Chile, <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> explained about 25 percent of sovereign spread volatility. This result may be associated to a sharper differentiation of countries economic performance by international investors. In fact, in recent years, movements of spreads have been mainly explained by idiosyncratic factors. Finally, the recent downturn of Chilean's spread was associated to a joint decrease of domestic and <b>common</b> <b>factors.</b> ...|$|R
30|$|Empirically, it is {{interesting}} to determine the number of <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> of the economy, given that we can summarize a large number of macroeconomic variables in few common trends. 1 Furthermore, by estimating the <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> we can observe the orthogonal dynamics of the economy, which is very important for macroeconomic policy. These <b>common</b> <b>factors,</b> for example, may be related to specific groups of variables, and it {{is interesting}} to analyze mechanisms of transmission to other groups of variables. Additionally, we can estimate the confidence intervals for the loading weights, <b>common</b> <b>factors,</b> and <b>common</b> components, which allow us to carry out statistical inference in order to better understand economic phenomena.|$|R

The length of the coat reached the waist but by the late 1650s and early 1660s, the coat became very short, only reaching {{the bottom of the}} rib cage, much like a bolero jacket. During the 1660s, the sleeves varied a lot from elbow length to no sleeves at all. The coat could be worn opened or buttoned in the front.

25|$|The {{two major}} Chinese {{philosophical}} schools discussed below, Confucianism and Legalism, strongly influenced {{the idea of}} law in China. Briefly, under Confucianism, the state should lead the people with virtue and thus {{create a sense of}} shame which will prevent bad conduct. Under Legalism, law is to be publicly promulgated standards of conduct backed by state coercion. The tension between these two systems is that Confucianism relies on tradition to make the leader the head of household of all China, while Legalism makes standard law that even the emperor should be bound by. The <b>common</b> <b>factor</b> is that both endorse to different degrees a paternalistic conception of the state, which knows better than its citizens and makes laws to protect them. This concept persisted throughout the imperial period, into the republican period, and can still be seen acting today.|$|E
25|$|In 1058, Baghdad was {{captured}} by the Fatimids under the Turkish general Abu'l-Ḥārith Arslān al-Basasiri, an adherent of the Ismailis along with the 'Uqaylid Quraysh. Not long {{before the arrival of}} the Saljuqs in Baghdad, al-Basasiri petitioned to the Fatimid Imam-Caliph al-Mustansir to support him in conquering Baghdad on the Ismaili Imam's behalf. It has recently come to light that the famed Fatimid da'i, al-Mu'ayyad al-Shirazi, had a direct role in supporting al-Basasiri and helped the general to succeed in taking Mawṣil, Wāsit and Kufa. Soon after, by December 1058, a Shi'i adhān (call to prayer) was implemented in Baghdad and a khutbah (sermon) was delivered {{in the name of the}} Fatimid Imam-Caliph. Despite his Shi'i inclinations, Al-Basasiri received support from Sunnis and Shi'is alike, for whom opposition to the Saljuq power was a <b>common</b> <b>factor.</b>|$|E
25|$|Individual {{factors of}} {{potential}} importance are genetic factors, prior radiation exposure, and previous head injury, such as concussion. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) {{has been shown}} to be an important and <b>common</b> <b>factor</b> in CNS responses. ApoE controls the redistribution of lipids among cells and is expressed at high levels in the brain. New studies are considering the effects of space radiation for the major isoforms of ApoE, which are encoded by distinct alleles (ε2, ε3, and ε4). The isoform ApoE ε4 {{has been shown to}} increase the risk of cognitive impairments and to lower the age for Alzheimer’s disease. It is not known whether the interaction of radiation sensitivity or other individual risks factors is the same for high- and low-LET radiation. Other isoforms of ApoE confer a higher risk for other diseases. People who carry at least one copy of the ApoE ε4 allele are at increased risk for atherosclerosis, which is also suspected to be a risk increased by radiation. People who carry two copies of the ApoE ε2 allele are at risk for a condition that is known as hyperlipoproteinemia type III. It will therefore be extremely challenging to consider genetic factors in a multipleradiation-risk paradigm.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, {{a series}} of ten {{articles}} on <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> theory {{was published in the}} APA journal Psychotherapy.

The article by Stefan G. Hofmann and David H. Barlow, two prominent researchers in cognitive behavioral therapy, pointed out how their recent shift in emphasis from distinct procedures for different diagnoses to a transdiagnostic approach was increasingly similar to <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> theory.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Common</b> <b>factors</b> theory, {{a theory}} guiding some {{research}} in clinical psychology and counseling psychology, proposes that different approaches and evidence-based practices in psychotherapy and counseling share <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> {{that account for}} much of the effectiveness of a psychological treatment.

According to one review, [...] "it is widely recognized that the debate between <b>common</b> and unique <b>factors</b> in psychotherapy represents a false dichotomy, and these factors must be integrated to maximize effectiveness".

25|$|This {{formation}} {{is widely used}} by Spanish, French and German sides. While it seems defensive to the eye, {{it is quite a}} flexible formation, as both the wide players and the full-backs join the attack. In defense, this {{formation is}} similar to either the 4–5–1 or 4–4–1–1. It is used to maintain possession of the ball and stopping opponent attacks by controlling the midfield area of the field. The lone striker may be very tall and strong to hold the ball up as his midfielders and full-backs join him in attack. The striker could also be very fast. In these cases, the opponent's defense will be forced to fall back early, thereby leaving space for the offensive central midfielder. This formation is used especially when a playmaker is to be highlighted. The variations of personnel used on the flanks in this set-up include using traditional wingers, using inverted wingers or simply using wide midfielders. Different teams and managers have different interpretations of the 4–2–3–1, but one <b>common</b> <b>factor</b> among them all is the presence of the double pivot. The efficiency and the compactness that the double pivot provides makes it vital to have in the modern game. The double pivot is the usage of two holding midfielders in front of the defence.|$|E
