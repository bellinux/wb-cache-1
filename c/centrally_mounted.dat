5|$|Combining the {{strengths}} of the both companies was not successful in bus chassis production because of strategic mistakes by SAT. The Vanaja LK-series with a large, <b>centrally</b> <b>mounted</b> engine was discontinued, which led to the loss of the main customer, Väinö Paunu Oy. SAT offered Sisu chassis to replace the Vanaja models, but a number of bus operators, including TKL, rejected them.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the high quality of his steam engines, sales {{increased}} a great deal and it became apparent that a new engine assembly shop was required. Murray designed this himself, and produced a huge three-storeyed circular building known as the Round Foundry. This contained a <b>centrally</b> <b>mounted</b> steam engine to power all of the machines in the building. Murray also built a house for himself adjoining the works. The design of this was pioneering, as each room was heated by steam pipes, so that it became known locally as Steam Hall.|$|E

5000|$|Rather than <b>centrally</b> <b>mounting</b> the {{transverse}} {{leaf spring}} and thus isolating {{the left and right}} sides of the springs, some manufacturers, starting with Fiat used two widely spaced spring mounts. This was first used {{on the front of the}} 1955 Fiat 600 and later at the rear on the Fiat 128. The spring is allowed to pivot inside of the mounts which allows the displacement of the spring on one side to affect the other side. This mechanical communication between the left and right sides of the suspension results in an effect similar to that of an anti-roll bar. [...] Chevrolet Corvettes, starting with the 4th generation in 1984 have combined the dual pivot mounts with FRP leaf springs.|$|R

25|$|Since it was {{impractical}} {{to try to}} fit {{more than}} one or two extra guns in the constrained space available in the front of a single-engined aircraft's fuselage, this led to an increasing proportion of the armament being mounted in the wings, firing outside the arc of the propeller. There were in fact some advantages in dispensing with <b>centrally</b> <b>mounted</b> guns altogether. Nevertheless, the conclusive redundancy of synchronization gears did not finally come until the introduction of jet propulsion and the absence of a propeller for guns to be synchronized with.|$|E
25|$|In March 1916, RFC Scout C No.5313 {{was fitted}} with a Vickers machine gun, {{synchronised}} to fire through the propeller by the awkward Vickers-Challenger synchronising gear, the only gear available to the RFC at that time. Six other Scouts, late Scout Cs and early Scout Ds, were also fitted with the same combination. Types using this gear (including the B.E.12, the R.E.8 and the Vickers F.B.19) all had the gun mounted {{on the port side}} of the fuselage. The attempt to use the gear for synchronising a <b>centrally</b> <b>mounted</b> gun on the Bristol Scout failed and tests, which continued at least until May 1916, resulted in the abandonment of the idea and no Vickers-armed Bristol Scouts were used in operations.|$|E
25|$|Like its predecessors, the V3's body {{consisted}} of welded steel tubing covered with treated fabric to save weight and make repairs easier. Its interior {{was divided into}} four sections— the cockpit, where pilot and observer sat side by side, with the pilot on the left; the load compartment; the engine compartment; and the tail section. The engine and gearbox were <b>centrally</b> <b>mounted</b> and {{held in place by}} a series of tensioned steel cables, with the gearbox in front of the engine. Two steel tube outriggers extended out from the sides of the fuselage to carry the twin rotors, of three-bladed configuration and wooden construction with a steel spar, which were mounted 12.5m (41ft 0in) apart, far enough that they did not overlap.|$|E

50|$|The SM.78 was a single-bay biplane. It had a {{long and}} slim aft fuselage, with a tall welded steel fin and a wooden {{horizontal}} tail <b>mounted</b> <b>centrally.</b> The lower hull had two steps, to aid take-off from the sea.|$|R
25|$|The {{prototype}} bus {{was equipped}} with an innovative system of Bombardier PRIMOVE, allowing inductive charging without connecting cables. The drive system uses an electric drive system by Vossloh Kiepe GmbH made in Düsseldorf. The motor was <b>centrally</b> <b>mounted</b> by 4 poles with the asynchronous motor which has a maximum power output of 160kW (1400 Nm) and allows the use of standard axles: ZF AV 132, and the independently sprung axle ZF RL 75 EC. Energy recovered during braking is stored in the lithium-ion batteries with a capacity of 210 kWh. The vehicle is also equipped with a plug-in connector {{that allows you to}} connect additional to an external energy source. All devices in the vehicle, which are usually powered by a diesel engine have been electrified. The air conditioning system has a built-Konvekta UL500EM CO2 heat pump, which is also used for heating the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Wheelbarrows in China came in two types. The {{more common}} type after the 3rd century has a large, <b>centrally</b> <b>mounted</b> wheel. Prior types were universally front-wheeled {{wheelbarrow}}s. The central-wheeled wheelbarrow could generally transport six human passengers at once, {{and instead of}} a laborious amount of energy exacted upon the animal or human driver pulling the wheelbarrow, {{the weight of the}} burden was distributed equally between the wheel and the puller. European visitors to China from the 17th century onwards had an appreciation for this, and was given a considerable amount of attention {{by a member of the}} Dutch East India Company, Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest, in his writings of 1797 (who accurately described its design and ability to hold large amounts of heavy baggage). However, the lower carrying surface made the European wheelbarrow clearly more useful for short-haul work. As of the 1960s, traditional wheelbarrows in China were still in wide use.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was a shoulder-wing monoplane {{powered by a}} 52kW (70hp) Gnome Gamma 7-cylinder rotary engine driving a two bladed propeller. The pilot and passenger were seated in side-by-side configuration: the control column was <b>centrally</b> <b>mounted</b> {{and there were two}} sets of rudder pedals, so that it could be flown from either seat. The shallow section rectangular fuselage tapered to a horizontal knife-edge at the tail, with the elongated triangular horizontal stabiliser mounted in the middle, its covering blending into that of the upper and lower fuselage surface. A semi-elliptical elevator was mounted on the trailing edge, and a triangular balanced rudder was mounted above the rear fuselage. Lateral control was effected by wing-warping, the wires leading to a single inverted V-strut cabane above the fuselage and a similar V strut beneath. Petrol was stored in three tanks: a pair of gravity tanks were located under the top decking in front of the cockpit, pressure-fed from a larger tank under the seats.|$|E

The car had a two-cylinder engine with boiler <b>mounted</b> <b>centrally.</b> the cars were advertised at $2000.|$|R
50|$|The gun was automatic, gas-operated, {{and locked}} by the breech block {{dropping}} down, which engaged the buttress guides {{on the block}} against the guides on the jacket. The recoil of the breech operated the feed mechanism. The buffer was <b>mounted</b> <b>centrally</b> in the cradle, between the two springs of the recuperator.|$|R
25|$|The {{front-wheel drive}} Medallion used the 2.2L I4 engine that also powered the European Renault 25. It was mounted in a {{longitudinal}} (front-back) configuration, driving {{the front wheels}} through either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 3-speed computer-controlled automatic. The longitudinal engine placement is unusual for a front-wheel drive car, as the transverse engine layout is typically more space-efficient. It {{was one of a}} few cars with this layout, which helps reduce torque steering. The gearbox is <b>centrally</b> <b>mounted</b> resulting in equal-length axle shafts. In Europe, Renault 21 versions with engine displacements below 2L had transverse engines, just like smaller models such as the Renault 9. Higher-end R 21 versions with engines of 2L or more, retained the longitudinal layout of the previous Renault 20 and 30 series. The longitudinally mounted versions had a shorter wheelbase than the European transverse versions. Product plans also called for a four-wheel drive Medallion to be imported in late-1988.|$|E
25|$|By June 1945, the {{aircraft}} {{that was to}} become the Canberra bore many similarities to the eventual design, despite the placement of a single, <b>centrally</b> <b>mounted</b> turbojet engine; Petter had held discussions with Rolls-Royce Ltd {{on the topic of}} the development of a scaled-up derivative of the Nene engine. In late 1945, the design was modified further with a pair of engines being adopted instead, initially to be set in the wing roots and later to be mounted in a mid-wing position; this change was made principally due to centre of gravity issues imposed by the position and weight of a heavy bombload and centrally-mounted single engine. The new engine position decreased {{the aircraft}}'s weight by 13 per cent and improved the aircraft's centre of gravity, as well as improved accessibility to the engines and related accessories, downsides were slightly elevated losses in the longer jet pipes and greater yaw during engine-out instances.|$|E
25|$|The Lexus RC F {{is a high}} {{performance}} version of the RC with the 5.0-liter 2UR-GSE V8 engine with Atkinson cycle at cruising speeds, eight-speed automatic transmission sending the power to the rear wheels.

Fuel and oil tanks were in the wing centre section.|$|R
500|$|The {{aircraft}} was furnished with a single-piece shoulder-mounted wing mounted {{across the top}} of the fuselage; the shape of the wing progressively alters from a clipped delta to a fully swept configuration, complete with extended leading edges and spaced out sawtooth extensions. A fully movable single-piece tailplane was also adopted, which was hinged upon the rear fuselage. The P.1127 had an atypical undercarriage arrangement, known as a [...] "zero-track" [...] tricycle undercarriage, which supported the majority of the aircraft's weight upon a pair of <b>centrally</b> <b>mounted</b> main wheels; steering was performed via a conventional nose wheel while balance was provided by a pair of wing tip-mounted outriggers.|$|E
500|$|The primary flight {{controls}} {{are compatible with}} the Hands On Throttle-And-Stick (HOTAS) control principle– the <b>centrally</b> <b>mounted</b> stick, in addition to flying the aircraft, also controls the cockpit displays and weapon systems. A triplex, digital fly-by-wire system is employed on the Gripen's {{flight controls}}, with a mechanical backup for the throttle. Additional functions, such as communications, navigational and decision support data, can be accessed via the up front control panel, directly above the central cockpit display. The Gripen includes the EP-17 cockpit display system, developed by Saab to provide pilots {{with a high level}} of situational awareness and reduces pilot workload through intelligent information management. [...] The Gripen features a sensor fusion capability, information from onboard sensors and databases is combined, automatically analysed, and useful data is presented to the pilot via a wide field-of-view head-up display, three large multi-function colour displays, and optionally a helmet mounted display system (HMDS).|$|E
