5|$|Practical {{implementations}} of road <b>congestion</b> <b>pricing</b> {{are found}} {{almost exclusively in}} urban areas, because traffic congestion is common in and around city centers.

This is an expressway connecting Paris to Lille, and since 1992 congestion prices have been applied during weekends with the objective of spreading demand on the trip back to Paris on Sunday afternoons and evenings. As <b>congestion</b> <b>pricing</b> has been increasing worldwide, the schemes implemented have been classified into four different types: cordon area around a city center; area wide congestion pricing; city center toll ring; and corridor or single facility <b>congestion</b> <b>pricing.</b>|$|E
40|$|TCP/IP can be {{interpreted}} as a distributed primal-dual algorithm to maximize aggregate utility over source rates. It has recently been shown that an equilibrium of TCP/IP, if exists, maximize the same aggregate utility function over both source rates and routes, provided pure <b>congestion</b> <b>prices</b> are used as link costs in the shortest-path calculation of IP. Moreover, the utility functions are delay-insensitive, i. e., they are functions of rates only. We extend this result in several ways. First, we show that if utility functions are delay-insensitive, then there are networks for which TCP/IP optimizes aggregate utility only if routing is based on pure <b>congestion</b> <b>prices.</b> Routing based on the weighted sum of <b>congestion</b> <b>prices</b> and propagation delays optimizes aggregate utility for general networks only if the utility functions are delay-sensitive. Moreover, we identify such a class of delay-sensitive utility functions that is implicitly optimized by TCP/IP. As for the delay-insensitive case, we show for this class of utility functions, equilibrium of TCP/IP exists if and only if the optimization problem has zero duality gap. In that case, there is no penalty for not splitting the traffic. We exhibit some counter-intuitive properties of this class of utility functions. We also prove that any class of delay-sensitive utility functions that are optimized by TCP/IP necessarily possess some strange properties. We prove that, for general networks, if the weight on <b>congestion</b> <b>prices</b> is small enough, only minimum-propagation-delay paths are selected. Hence if all source-destination pairs have unique minimum-propagation-delay paths, then equilibrium of TCP/IP exists and is asymptotically stable. For general networks, their equilibrium properties are the same as a modified network where paths with non-minimum propagation delays are deleted and routing is based on pure <b>congestion</b> <b>prices.</b> It is commonly believed that there is generally an inevitable tradeoff between utility maximization and stability in TCP/IP networks. In particular, as the weight on <b>congestion</b> <b>prices</b> increases, the routing will change from stable to unstable. We exhibit a counterexample where routing changes from stable to unstable and then to stable again, as the weight on <b>congestion</b> <b>prices</b> increases. Moreover, one can construct a network with any given utility profile {{as a function of the}} weight on <b>congestion</b> <b>prices...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recently {{there has}} been a renewed {{interest}} in the application of economic models to the management of computational resources. Most of this interest is focused on pricing models for the Internet; in particular, on <b>congestion</b> or shadow <b>prices,</b> that address the phenomenon of what economists call external costs [...] - users are exposed to the costs they impose on other users when causing congestion of a resource. This paper describes how <b>congestion</b> <b>prices</b> can be applied to resource management in operating systems. Shadow prices are interpreted as feedback signals to applications which can adjust their resource requirements according to an application-specific strategy.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{resource}} allocation in ad hoc network is formulated, as a utility maximization problem the constraint considered is rate constraint. Rate constraint is defined {{such that the}} traffic flow from source node to the destination should be less than the net channel capacity between them but at the optimum value. In cross layer design optimization of rate constraint can be done using three layer constraints namely congestion constraint of transport layer, routing constraint of network layer, schedulable constraint of link layer. These three components form the core components of rate optimization. We formulate a <b>congestion</b> <b>price</b> to interact with congestion constraint, routing constraint and scheduling constraint in a fixed wireless channels. This principle can be extended to time varying channel and multi-rate devices. Here {{in this study we}} establish a relationship between congestion window and local <b>congestion</b> <b>price.</b> Resource allocation namely wireless links of fixed bandwidth is done to optimize these constraints. We are considering this problem as utility maximization with the constraints of rate, routing and scheduling. The resources considered are inter nodal paths of fixed channel bandwidths, for optimal utilization. Let us look at the resource allocation problem using <b>congestion</b> <b>price</b> as the flow variable. We prove the convergence of the algorithm. In this analysis we have considered time invariable and fixed rate devices. The stability of the system is established. Its performance is characterized with respect to an ideal reference system which has the optimum rate region at link layer.

30|$|In [7], the transactive {{control method}} {{is applied to}} solve {{distribution}} network grid congestion between the distribution system operator and the electric vehicle (EV) fleet operators, who manage the charging of EVs centrally. Firstly, the EV fleet operators (FO) generate optimal charging schedules, based on the energy spot price. However, {{the sum of the}} charging schedule of all the FOs may bring operational challenges to the DSO, and thus it needs to be modified. Then, a flexibility cost function of FO is formulated that reflects the charging power deviation from the scheduled charging power {{in the form of a}} quadratic function. The overall objective is to minimize the flexibility cost function of EV FOs with respect to the grid capacity constraints. The minimization is formulated as a Lagrange problem, and solved iteratively using a decomposition algorithm. The Lagrange multipliers are interpreted as <b>congestion</b> <b>price</b> that coordinates the EV FOâs charging profiles. Furthermore, the study is extended in [21] to solve the voltage-band violations by introducing <b>congestion</b> <b>prices</b> at the buses level.|$|R
5|$|<b>Congestion</b> <b>pricing</b> or {{congestion}} charges is {{a system}} of surcharging users of public goods that are subject to congestion through excess demand such as higher peak charges for use of bus services, electricity, metros, railways, telephones, and road pricing to reduce traffic congestion; airlines and shipping companies may be charged higher fees for slots at airports and through canals at busy times. This pricing strategy regulates demand, {{making it possible to}} manage congestion without increasing supply. Market economics theory, which encompasses the <b>congestion</b> <b>pricing</b> concept, postulates that users will be forced to pay for the negative externalities they create, making them conscious of the costs they impose upon each other when consuming during the peak demand, and more aware of their impact on the environment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract â Despite {{the large}} body of work {{studying}} congestion control and adaptive routing in isolation, much less {{attention has been paid}} to whether these two resource-allocation mechanisms work well together to optimize user performance. Most analysis of congestion control assumes static routing, and most studies of adaptive routing assume that the offered traffic is fixed. In this paper, we analyze the interaction between congestion control and adaptive routing, and study the stability and optimality of the joint system. Previous work has shown that the system can be modelled as a joint optimization problem that naturally leads to a primal-dual algorithm with shortest-path routing using <b>congestion</b> <b>prices</b> as the link weights. In practice, the algorithm is commonly unstable. We consider three alternative timescale separations and examine the stability and optimality of each system. Our analytic characterizations and simulation experiments demonstrate how the step size of the congestioncontrol algorithm affects the stability of the system, and how the timescale of each control loop and homogeneity of link capacities affect system stability and optimality. The stringent conditions imposed for stability suggests that <b>congestion</b> <b>price</b> would be a poor feedback mechanism in practice...|$|R

40|$|A unified {{approach}} to congestion control and node-based multipath routing Fernando Paganini, Senior Member, IEEE, and Enrique Mallada AbstractâThe paper considers a TCP/IP-style network with flow control at end-systems based on congestion feedback, and routing decisions at network nodes on a perdestination basis. The main generalization {{with respect to}} standard IP is to allow routers to split their traffic in a controlled way between the outgoing links. We formulate global optimization criteria, combining those used in the congestion control and traffic engineering, and propose decentralized controllers at sources and routers to reach these optimal points, based on <b>congestion</b> <b>price</b> feedback. We first consider adapting the traffic splits at routers to follow the negative price gradient; we prove this is globally stabilizing when combined with primal congestion control, but can exhibit oscillations {{in the case of}} dual congestion control. We then propose an alternative anticipatory control of routing, proving its stability for the case of dual congestion control. We present a concrete implementation of such algorithms, based on queueing delay as <b>congestion</b> <b>price.</b> We use TCP-FAST for congestion control, and develop a multipath variant of the distance vector routing protocol RIP.

40|$|Abstract â We {{present a}} model for the joint design of {{congestion}} control and media access control (MAC) for ad hoc wireless networks. Using contention graph and contention matrix, we formulate resource allocation in the network as a utility maximization problem with constraints that arise from contention for channel access. We present two algorithms that are not only distributed spatially, but more interestingly, they decompose vertically into two protocol layers where TCP and MAC jointly solve the system problem. The first is a primal algorithm where the MAC layer at the links generates <b>congestion</b> (contention) <b>prices</b> based on local aggregate source rates, and TCP sources adjust their rates based on the aggregate prices in their paths. The second is a dual subgradient algorithm where the MAC sub-algorithm is implemented through scheduling linklayer flows according to the <b>congestion</b> <b>prices</b> of the links. Global convergence properties of these algorithms are proved. This is a preliminary step towards a systematic approach to jointly design TCP congestion control algorithms and MAC algorithms, not only to improve performance, but more importantly, to make their interaction more transparent...|$|R
