5000|$|Many {{subsurface}} diagnostic horizons {{are used}} to characterize different soils in soil taxonomy. Each diagnostic horizon provides a characteristic that helps place a soil in its proper class in the system. A soil {{may or may not}} have a subsurface diagnostic horizon. There are approximately 20 subsurface diagnostic horizons, of which include the argillic horizon, natric horizon, kandic horizon, oxic horizon, spodic horizon, and albic horizon. The argillic horizon (designated as Bt) is characterized by a thick accumulation of silicate clays that have moved downward from the upper horizons or have formed in place. The argillic horizon often contains clays with shiny coatings termed [...] "argillans" [...] or [...] "clay skins", and accompanied by less than 15% exchangeable sodium on the <b>colloidal</b> <b>complex.</b> The natric horizon (designated as Btn) similarly has silicate clay accumulation with clay skins, but the clays are accompanied by more than 15% exchangeable sodium on the <b>colloidal</b> <b>complex</b> and by columnar or prismatic soil structural units. The natric horizon is most commonly found in arid and semiarid regions. The kandic horizon (designated as Bt, Bts), sometimes referred to as [...] "old" [...] clays, has an accumulation of Fe and Al oxides as well as low-activity silicate clays (e.g., kaolinite), but clay skins need not be evident. The clays are low in activity as shown by their low cation-holding capacities. The oxic horizon (designated as Bo) is a very weathered horizon with a high content of Fe/Al oxides and low-activity silicate clays. It is generally physically stable, crumbly, and not very sticky, despite its high clay content. It is found most commonly in humid tropical and subtropical regions. The spodic horizon (designated as Bh, Bhs) is an illuvial and dark-colored horizon that is characterized by the accumulation of colloidal organic matter and aluminium oxide with or without iron oxide. It is commonly found in highly leached forest soils of cool humid climates, typically on sandy-textured parent materials. The albic horizon (designated as E) is an eluvial and light-colored horizon that is characterized by a low content of clay and Fe/Al oxides.|$|E

Titrations of copolymers by surfactants and of surfactants by copolymers revealed that the electrostatic co-assembly was an endothermic reaction, suggesting a process dominated by the entropy of the counterions. Here {{we found that the}} thermodynamic quantities associated with the reaction depended on the mixing order. When surfactants were added stepwise to copolymers, the titration was associated with the formation of single micelles decorated by a unique polymer. Above a critical charge ratio, the micelles rearranged themselves into 100 nm <b>colloidal</b> <b>complexes</b> in a collective process which displayed the following features : i) the process was very slow as compared to the timescale of Brownian diffusion, ii) the thermodynamic signature was a endothermic peak and iii) the stoichiometry between the positive and negative charges was modified from n = 0. 48 (single micelles) to 0. 75 (core-shell complexes). The amount of polyelectrolytes needed for the complex formation exceeded the number required to compensate the net micellar charge, confirming the evidence of overcharging in the complex formation.

The two systems are similar in terms of structure and molecular weight but have different electrostatic charges. The neutron scattering data have been interpreted {{in terms of a}} model that assumes the formation of mixed polymer-surfactant aggregates, also called colloidal complexes. These complexes exhibit a core-shell microstructure, where the core is a dense coacervate microphase of micelles surrounded by neutral blocks.

In order to analyze quantitatively the neutron data, we develop two different approaches to derive the number of surfactant micelles per polymer in the mixed aggregates and the distributions of aggregation numbers. With these results, we show that the formation of the <b>colloidal</b> <b>complex</b> is in agreement with the overcharging predictions.

This chapter summarizes current understanding on PTMs of the αs 1 -, αs 2 -, β-, and κ-caseins. Caseins are assembled in a <b>colloidal</b> <b>complex</b> with calcium phosphate and small amounts of other minerals. The casein micelle structure is critical in determining the physical properties of milk and for the provision of amino acids, calcium, and phosphorus for infant nutrition.

In recent years, the development of proteomic technologies has greatly enhanced our ability to analyze milk proteins, particularly with respect to PTMs. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE) provides a high-resolution methodology for displaying the heterogeneity of the major milk proteins. Advances in mass spectrometry (MS) have enhanced our ability to analyze the proteins arrayed on 2 -D gels.

This ability becomes more pronounced if the degree of dispersity is higher, i. e. if particles have smaller diameters. Total of 435 soil samples were collected from the surface horizon in 2011, {{for the purpose of}} soil fertility control in Vojvodina and prevention of its possible degradation in broader terms. This paper presents a part of study through selected representative soil samples, related to the research results of mechanical composition, basic chemical properties, and cation-exchange capacity in the most frequent types of soils in North Bačka and Banat (chernozem, fluvisol, semiglay, humoglay, solonchak, solonetz), {{due to the fact that}} soil fertility and its ecological function in environment protection largely depend on the studied properties. The average content of clay was 25. 26 %, ranging from 5. 76 to 49. 44 %, the average content of humus was 3. 10 %, ranging between 1. 02 and 4. 30 %, while the average value of CEC was 27. 30 cmol/kg, ranging between 12. 03 and 46. 06 cmol/kg. Soils with higher content of clay and humus have greater cation-exchange capacity. According to the established average values of CEC in cmol/kg, the order of soil types is as follows: solonetz (40. 06), semiglay (31. 98), humoglay (30. 98), solonchak (26. 62), chernozem (22. 72), and fluvisol (22. 40).

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{theory is}} presented for {{the dynamics of}} metal speciation in monodisperse suspensions of soft spherical particles characterized by a hard core and an ion-permeable shell layer where ligands L are localized. The heterogeneity in the binding site distribution leads to complex formation/dissociation rate constants (denoted as ka / and kd /, respectively) that may substantially differ from their homogeneous solution counterparts (ka and kd). The peculiarities of metal speciation dynamics in soft colloidal ligand dispersions result from the coupling between diffusive transport of free-metal ions M within and around the soft surface layer and the kinetics of ML complex formation/dissociation within the shell component of the particle. The relationship between ka,d / and ka,d {{is derived from the}} numerical evaluation of the spatial, time-dependent distributions of free and bound metal. For that purpose, the corresponding diffusion equations corrected by the appropriate chemical source term are solved in spherical geometry using a Kuwabara-cell-type representation where the intercellular distance is determined by the volume fraction of soft particles. The numerical study is supported by analytical approaches valid in the short time domain. For dilute dispersions of soft ligand particles, it is shown that the balance between free-metal diffusion within and outside of the shell and the kinetic conversion of M into ML within the particular soft surface layer rapidly establishes a quasi-steadystate regime. For sufficiently long time, chemical equilibrium between the free and bound metal is reached within the reactive particle layer, which corresponds to the true steady-state regime for the system investigated. The analysis reported covers the limiting cases of rigid particles where binding sites are located at the very surface of the particle core (e. g., functionalized latex colloids) and polymeric particles that are devoid of a hard core (e. g., polysaccharide macromolecules, gel particles). For both the transient and quasi-steady-state regimes, the dependence of ka,d / on the thickness of the soft surface layer, the radius of the hard core of the particle, and the kinetic rate constants ka,d for homogeneous ligand solutions is thoroughly discussed within the context of dynamic features for <b>colloidal</b> <b>complex</b> systems...|$|E
40|$|The pH {{study of}} artificially {{prepared}} soils having {{at the same}} time exchangeable Na and H in the soil <b>colloidal</b> <b>complex,</b> showed that these soil samples have an acid to slight alkaline reaction (pH = 4. 8 - 8. 3), unlike native soils (without exchangeable H), that have a high alkaline re-action (pH = 8. 5 - 10. 0). For these base unsaturated soils the following relation is valid: Ph =- 0. 0005 VNa 2 + 0. 0931 VNa+ 4. 4581. This equation shows that pH values in the acid-neutral domain are maintained even for very high percentage of exchangeable Na. The multiple rela-tion between pH on one part and V and VNa on the other is the following: pH = 0. 026 V + 0. 033 VNa + 4. 20; an increase of VNa with 10 % corresponds to an increase with 0. 33 pH units and an increase of V with 10 % (or decrease of VH with 10 %) corresponds to an increase of 0. 26 pH units. The pKs calculated from the last equation is about 5. 50. In the case of saturated soils having different degree of exchangeable sodium, the relation for pH-VNa is: pH = 0. 031 VNa + 8. 58; one can see that an increase of VNa with 10 % results in a pH increase with 0. 31 units, very close to that of base unsaturated soil. The soils polluted with brines can have a more acid reaction than the reaction of the soil samples presented in the paper, due to the pres-ence of NaCl (exchange acidity in unsaturated soils or especially saline effect in saturated soils). Consequently, a revaluation of the genetic and diagnostic signification of the VNa, as well as of its significance from land im-provement point of view is necessary. It is also adequate to study the plant nutrition influence of the soil having {{at the same time}} various high saturation degrees of cation exchange capacity both for exchangeable sodium and ex-changeable hydrogen.

40|$|The lattice Boltzmann (LB) {{method is}} a {{versatile}} way to model complex fluids with hydrodynamic interactions through solving the Navier-Stokes equations. It is well-known {{that the role}} of hydrodynamic interactions is ignorable in studying the Boltzmann equilibrium of colloidal (Brownian) particles. However, full hydrodynamic interactions {{play an important role in}} their dynamics. In the LB framework for moving colloids, the “bounce-back on links” method is used to calculate the hydrodynamic forces. In this thesis, three kinds of <b>colloidal</b> <b>complex</b> fluids with full hydrodynamic interactions are simulated by lattice Boltzmann methods: colloids in a binary fluid, magnetic colloids in a single fluid and magnetic colloids in a binary fluid. First, we have done extensive simulations of nanoparticles in a binary fluid, following up previous work[1] which predicted formation of a “bijel” (bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gel) in symmetric fluid quenches. Our work in this thesis focuses on the analysis of the dynamics after nanoparticles become arrested on the fluid-fluid interfaces under conditions varying from a symmetric quench to a strongly asymmetric quench. Although these new simulations extend the time window studied by a factor of two, slow domain growth is still observed. Our new analyses address the mechanics of the slow residual dynamics which involves cooperative motion of the nanoparticles at the fluid-fluid interfaces. The second topic is the LB simulation of colloidal ferrofluids to see the effect of full hydrodynamic interactions among magnetic colloids. The main focus is on how the hydrodynamic interaction affects both the equilibrium dynamics of these dipolar systems and also their transient dynamics to form clusters. Numerically, magnetic colloids are implemented with the long-range dipolar interactions described by Ewald summation. To check the effect of full hydrodynamic interactions, Brownian dynamics without any hydrodynamic interaction has been done for comparison: Monte Carlo results are also reported. We confirm that our LB generates the Boltzmann distribution for static equilibrium properties, by comparison with these methods. However, the equilibrium dynamics is altered: hydrodynamic interactions make the structural relaxations slower in both the short-time and the long-time regime. This slow relaxation rate is also found for transient motions. The third topic addresses magnetic colloids in a binary fluid. In contrast with the preceding two systems which correspond directly to laboratory experiments, this last system is so far only predicted by the LB results in this thesis. To explore this hypothetical new material by the LB method, the basic structures are investigated in terms of both domain growth morphology and the arrangement of magnetic colloids. Under conditions varying from a symmetric quench to an asymmetric quench, a chainlike arrangement is observed for dipoles jammed on the surfaces, but the basic morphology of domains is still maintained regardless of the dipolar strength. In addition, applying external field affects the morphology of domains and the stability of domain structures. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

For labile complexes, the computation of such flux {{is based on the}} concept of average diffusion coefficient, which has only been checked systematically with small size ligands and in aqueous solution. This concept is checked here, both in aqueous solution and in agarose hydrogel, with large size macromolecules: dextrans of molar masses 10 000, 40 000 and 464 000, modified to introduce fluorescent or complexing (aspartate) moieties in their structure have been used. Their diffusion properties in water and agarose gel are determined by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). The complexing and diffusive properties of their Pb(II) complexes in water and agarose hydrogel are also determined by scanning stripping chronopotentiometry (SSCP). It is shown that both in water and gel, the concept of average diffusion coefficient is applicable to compute the flux of these labile complexes at consuming interfaces. The results also show that the three ligands and their Pb-complexes diffuse as spherical coils, in water and in the gel, in accordance with other recent results. The implications of these results, in environmental applications, in particular in biouptake, and for the development of in situ sensors for environmental monitoring, are discussed, as well as the optimum conditions of voltammetric measurements with get integrated microelectrode (GIME) in natural media containing <b>colloidal</b> <b>complexes.</b> In particular it is shown that, provided the gel is correctly preequilibrated with the test solution, and its thickness is larger than 150 mu m, diffusion/reaction in the test solution do not influence the voltammetric flux at microelectrodes in the gel. The same conclusion is applicable to microorganisms inside biofilms. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|When polyelectrolyte-neutral block {{copolymers}} {{are mixed}} in solutions to oppositely charged species (e. g. surfactant micelles, macromolecules, proteins etc), {{there is the}} formation of stable supermicellar aggregates combining both components. The resulting <b>colloidal</b> <b>complexes</b> exhibit a core-shell structure and the mechanism yielding to their formation is electrostatic self-assembly. In this contribution, {{we report on the}} structural properties of supermicellar aggregates made from yttrium-based inorganic nanoparticles (radius 2 nm) and polyelectrolyte-neutral block copolymers in aqueous solutions. The yttrium hydroxyacetate particles were chosen as a model system for inorganic colloids, and also for their use in industrial applications as precursors for ceramic and opto-electronic materials. The copolymers placed under scrutiny are the water soluble and asymmetric poly(sodium acrylate) poly(acrylamide) diblocks. Using static and dynamical light scattering experiments, we demonstrate the analogy between surfactant micelles and nanoparticles in the complexation phenomenon with oppositely charged polymers. We also determine the sizes and the aggregation numbers of the hybrid organic-inorganic complexes. Several additional properties are discussed, such as the remarkable stability of the hybrid aggregates and the dependence of their sizes on the mixing conditions.

40|$|One of the {{critical}} shortcomings {{in the evaluation of}} land management practices (such as BMP’s, land application of wastes, septic tanks, etc) is the lack of effective methods to evaluate impacts on groundwater quality. Groundwater sampling is also required in a number of cases (such after the detection of a spill) by NYS DEC as well as other states, but the results are difficult to interpret. For example, in some cases groundwater concentrations initially below the legal limit increased after the water table height increased in the spring as residual pollutants left in the vadose zone were mobilized by the rising groundwater. Many pollutants (trace metals, pesticides, organics) are mobilized as <b>colloidal</b> <b>complexes</b> which may be excluded from sampling devices by filtration. Research to date demonstrates that sampling methods can {{have a significant impact on}} monitoring results, especially for soils that have significant preferential flow. Expected Benefits We propose examine different soil and water sampling techniques for their capability to capture the transport of water and contaminants in the soil.

40|$|Biomaterials are {{considered}} as very promising tools for regenerative medicine. They have compensatory or supporting function in organism {{and they are}} often developed to support specific conventional medical procedures. So-called biomimetic materials are developed to imitate natural environment of organism and to induce positive innate responses of organism. An essential part of biomaterial development is in vitro biological evaluation, which characterizes (often for the first time) the potential of developed material for its clinical application. This Ph. D. thesis deals with in vitro biological evaluation of three different biomimetic materials. In all three cases, the comprehensive evaluation {{was an integral part}} of the material development and optimization processes. Each material was in vitro characterised at the level of cell-material interactions with respect to its intended specific application [...] In the first part, cell response to potential drug delivery system based on <b>colloidal</b> <b>complexes</b> of cationic surfactants with hyaluronic acid (HyA) was characterized. HyA protection ability and its limits were described; also the role of fetal bovine serum (FBS) in cell response to the stress stimuli was confirmed.

40|$|Folic acid {{has been}} {{investigated}} as a targeting ligand for imaging and therapeutic agent for over a decade; however, studies on its use in targeting of nonviral gene or nucleic acids delivery systems are sparse. This study assesses potential application of a new folic acid conjugate with aminomethacrylatephosphoryl-choline based copolymer (DMAEMA-MPCFA) as a targeting gene delivery vector. The folate-conjugated polymers produce colloidally stable polyplexes with a particle size < 200 nm and demonstrate the ability to protect DNA from enzymatic degradation to a certain extent. In cells that overexpress folate receptors (MCF- 7 and KB cultures), the conjugated systems show a folate-specific association and achieved significantly enhanced transfection efficiency, compared to the nonconjugated control, with a dramatically reduced nonspecific cellular association. The transfection enhancement is achieved without a corresponding increase in cellular association, suggesting that an internal cellular trafficking of folate-conjugated system may be altered, resulting in an increased transfection efficacy. In summary, a new folate-conjugated aminomethacrylatephosphorylcholine copolymer is capable of forming <b>colloidal</b> <b>complexes</b> with DNA, modulating their specific cell uptake and improving the level of cell transfection in folate expressing cells. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Colloidal systems {{based on}} {{synthetic}} polymers {{have a history}} of use as delivery systems in pharmaceutical sector. Though there has been a significant growth in the area synthetic polymer based delivery systems, their applications in area of food formulations is quite limited owing to the stringent regulatory requirements in the food industry. With the current popularity of functional foods, where the emphasis is on fortifying food products with novel functional ingredients, the need for finding food-grade delivery systems have been felt more than ever before. Hence, a great deal of effort has been put in identifying food-approved materials to generate novel colloidal structures which could be further used for encapsulation and delivery of nutrients and nutraceuticals. The objective of the current paper is to demonstrate illustrative examples based on our recently published research focussing on the use of food-grade materials for the development of novel micro/nano structures for encapsulation and delivery of functional ingredients including phytochemicals, vitamins, flavors, and colorants. Specifically, the paper will focus on the generation, morphological characterization and demonstrated applications of colloidal particles, supramolecular nanocolloids, <b>colloidal</b> <b>complexes</b> and novel microcapsules, all based on food-grade materials...|$|R
