40|$|INTRODUCTION In {{the present}} work the Multipoint Approximation Method (MAM) has been {{enhanced}} with new capabilities that allow to solve large scale design optimization problems more efficiently. The first feature is adaptive building of approximate models during the optimization search. And the second feature is a parallel implementation of MAM. A traditional approach to adaptive building of metamodels is to check several types for their quality {{on a set}} of design points and select the best type. The technique presented in this paper is based on the <b>assembly</b> <b>of</b> multiple metamodels into one model using linear regression. The obtained <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> the model <b>assembly</b> are not weights of the individual models but regression coefficients determined by the least squares minimization method.

Madding's work (Madding [2008]) is one of the earliest studies that propose a method for analyzing thermal images to estimate the actual heat transfer conditions for building envelopes. Based on the environmental assumption of a steady-state heat transfer condition of building environments, this work measured the R-value <b>of</b> drywall <b>assemblies</b> using the indoor surface temperature data obtained from thermal images. The measurements were experimentally conducted in controlled lab environments, and then they were compared with the theoretical expected properties.

The reliability of solder interconnects is 0 - primarily determined by two factors; 1. the type <b>of</b> electronic <b>assembly</b> and 2. the T " environment to which the assembly is exposed. These two factors (each composed of severam variables i. e. assembly thermal expansion <b>coefficients,</b> elastic moduli <b>of</b> <b>assembly</b> members, maximum operating temperature, rate of temperature change, etc.) boil down to three critical CO parameters; temperature, strain and strain rate (or stress).

40|$|The paper {{reports a}} {{preliminary}} {{study of the}} behavior of a high performance controlledclearance piston gauge (CCPG) in the pressure range up to 1 GPa through finite elemental analysis (FEA). The details of the experimental haracterization of this CCPG has already been published (Yadav et al., 2007 [1]). We have already pointed out that the use of Heydemann–Welch (HW) model for the characterization of any CCPG, has some limitation {{due to the fact that}} the linear extrapolation of the cube root of the fall rate versus jacket pressure (v 1 / 3 –pj) curve is assumed to be independent of the rheological properties of the pressure transmitting fluids.

40|$|Tolerance {{analysis}} <b>of</b> an <b>assembly</b> is {{an important}} issue for mechanical design. Among various tolerance analysis methods, statistical analysis is the most commonly employed method. However, the conventional statistical tolerance method is often based on the normal distribution. It fails to predict the resultant tolerance <b>of</b> an <b>assembly</b> <b>of</b> parts with non-normal distributions. In this paper, a novel method based on statistical moments is proposed. Tolerance distributions of parts are first transferred into statistical moments that are then used for computing tolerance stack-up. The computed moments, particularly the variance, the skewness and the kurtosis, are then mapped back to probability distributions in order to calculate the resultant tolerance <b>of</b> the <b>assembly.</b> The proposed method can be used to analyse the resultant tolerance specification for non-normal distributions with different skewness and kurtosis. Simulated results showed that tail <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> different distributions with the same kurtosis are close to each other for normalised probabilities between 3 and 3. That is, the tail <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> a statistical distribution can be predicted by the <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> skewness and kurtosis. Two examples are illustrated in the paper to demonstrate the proposed method. The predicted resultant tolerances of the two examples are only 0. 5 % and 1. 5 % differences compared with that by the Monte Carlo simulation for 1, 000, 000 samples. The proposed method is much faster in computation with higher accuracy than conventional statistical tolerance methods. The merit of the proposed method is that the computation is fast and comparatively accurate for both symmetrical and unsymmetrical distributions, particularly when the required probability is between 2 and 3...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMixtures of lipids and {{detergents}} {{are known}} to form bicelles at certain parameter ranges, but many uncertainties remain concerning {{the details of the}} phase behaviour of these mixtures and the morphology of the formed lipid assemblies. Here we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) diffusion data in combination with the multivariate processing method speedy component resolution (SCORE) to analyse mixtures of 1, 2 -dihexanoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DHPC) and 1, 2 -dimyristoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DMPC) with the relative concentration q=[DMPC]/[DHPC]= 0. 5 at total lipid concentrations ranging from 15 to 300 mM. With this approach we were able to resolve the heavily overlapping mixture spectra into component spectra and obtained reliable diffusion coefficients for lipid concentrations in the range 15 to 300 mM, although at high concentrations (250 – 300 mM), non-negativity constraints or overfactoring was required to successfully decompose the data. At 50 – 300 mM total lipid concentration, the radii estimated from the diffusion <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> DMPC indicate <b>assemblies</b> <b>of</b> the appropriate bicelle size, although small size variations exist, while at lower concentrations the morphology appears to change to larger assemblies. Taken together, the results suggest that for q= 0. 5 DMPC/DHPC mixtures there is a relatively broad concentration range above 50 mM where bicelles may reliably be assumed to adopt the ‘classical’ bicelle morphology. The study clearly demonstrates the usefulness of our approach for accurately determining physical properties of complex mixtures such as bicelles. Both reliable diffusion coefficients and chemical shifts can be derived from overlapping data. This should prove useful for analysing the behaviour of other, more complex, lipid mixtures...|$|R

Findings. The analysis of the lubrication method effect, the operating mode of the mechanism and the wrapping angle of a block by a rope on losses in bearings was carried out for rope blocks. The corresponding comparative tables of losses are given. Analysis of the obtained calculation results allows us to establish: 1) the main resistance affecting the cable blocks efficiency is the resistance in bearings; 2) the second largest component is the stiffness losses, depending on the operating mode, the wrapping angle of a block by a rope, the type of bearing lubrication; 3) the block efficiency when rotating the inner cage is higher than rotating the outer one by about 3 % with thick lubrication and 1 M mode; 4) in the sequential location <b>of</b> <b>assemblies</b> with a rolling bearing, it is necessary to strive for the design <b>of</b> the <b>assembly</b> in which the inner cage rotates; 5) with the number of blocks up to 5, one can use the recommended definitions of block bearings in the literature with an error in the efficiency value of up to 10 %.

In this study, we used stochastic models to generate a three-dimensional reconstruction of the MPL. This work {{is a continuation of}} the methods presented in [10]. A parametric study was carried out to investigate the effects of the MPL structure and MPL porosity on its diffusion coefficient and thermal conductivity. It was found that increasing the volume of the small pores of the MPL while keeping its overall porosity constant results in an increase in the Knudsen diffusion; hence a decrease of the overall diffusion coefficient. This similar trend is observed again once the porosity of the MPL is decreased. An increase in the volume of small pores also resulted in an increase of the thermal conductivity of the MPL. The parametric study was also extended to understand the effect of applying the MPL onto the gas diffusion layer (GDL). In this case, we investigated the effect of MPL thickness, porosity and its penetration into the GDL.
