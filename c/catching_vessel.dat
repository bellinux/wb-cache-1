50|$|Some {{factory ships}} can also {{function}} as mother ships. The basic {{idea of a}} mother ship {{is that it can}} carry small fishing boats that return to the mother ship with their catch. But the idea extends to include factory trawlers supporting a fleet of smaller <b>catching</b> <b>vessels</b> that are not carried on board. They serve as the main ship in a fleet operating in waters a great distance from their home ports.|$|R
50|$|The fishing {{industry}} is the region's only food sector and {{is second in}} importance after mining. The 600000 km2 area of the Sea of Okhotsk that borders on Magadan Oblast {{is one of the}} most productive regions of the world's oceans. Magadan Oblast has more than 15900 km of coastline and 29016 km of rivers of commercial importance. The <b>catching</b> <b>vessels</b> of the oblast's fishing companies operate mainly in Russia's economic zone, the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea, and to some extent in the Sea of Japan. Most of the catch comes from coastal waters. Fishing industry companies are concentrated in Magadan, Ola, Yamsk, and Evensk. The most important commercial fish are pollock, herring, cod, navaga (a member of the cod family), flounder, and various kinds of salmon. Crabs, squid, shrimp, and whelks are also caught.|$|R
40|$|The new {{technologies}} utilizing secondary energy resources (SER) have been suggested. These are the following: a parallel {{and a series}} heat utilization diagrams of exhaust gases emitted by internal combustion engines (ICE), supercharging air. The conditions providing the realization of diagrams of SER complex utilization diagrams have been investigated, effecient diagrams with power intake for fish factory ships have been developed. A new qualitative representation of engine and steam boiler loads as random variables has been introduced, and, based on it, new more reliable methods of a comparative analysis of various powerplants (PP) and SER utilization efficiency estimatios have been created, with a random character of the engine and steam boiler loads considered. The recommendations concerning the utilization of SER in the fish fleet, as well as specific requirements for the utilization plants of the <b>catching</b> <b>vessels</b> have been drawn up, the heat radiated by the ICE exhaust gases has been utilized {{in a series of}} vessels (the "Agat", the "Prometei") in the refrigerating factory ship "Nikolay Kopernik". The field of application is the fish industry fleet and the design organizations of the ship-building industry.

Detmers named the ship Kormoran, inspired by [...] (a Russian merchant ship captured by the Germans during World War I and operated as a raider) and the cormorant (with Detmers comparing the seabird's use in fishing to his ship's attempts in <b>catching</b> Allied <b>vessels).</b> After a successful trials cruise in September 1940, Kormoran was commissioned on 9 October.|$|R
40|$|Since its {{description}} by Dandy in 1922, several {{techniques have}} been used to perform third ventriculostomy under endoscopic control. Except for the blunt technique, in which the endoscope is used by itself to create the opening in the floor of the third ventricle, the other techniques require more than one instrument to perforate the floor of the ventricle and enlarge the ventriculostomy. The new device described is a sterilizable modified forceps that allows both the opening of the floor and the enlargement of the ventriculostomy in a simple and effective way. The new device has the following characteristics: 1) the tip of the forceps is thin enough to allow the easy perforation of the floor of the ventricle; 2) the inner surface of the jaws is smooth to avoid <b>catching</b> <b>vessels</b> of the basal cistern; and 3) the outer surface of the jaws has indentations that catch the edges of the opening to prevent them from slipping along the instrument's jaws. The ventricle floor is opened by gentle pressure of the forceps, which is slowly opened so that the edges of the aperture are caught by the distal outer indentation of the jaws, leading to an approximately 4 -mm opening of the floor. This device has been used successfully in 10 consecutive patients. This new device allows surgeons to perform third ventriculostomy under endoscopic control in a very simple, quick, and effective way, avoiding the need for additional single-use instrument...|$|R

50|$|A fish factory, {{also called}} a fish plant, fish {{processing}} facility, is a facility where fish processing is performed. Fish factories {{range in the}} size and range of species of fish they process. Some species of fish, such as mackerel and herring, and can be caught at sea by large pelagic trawlers and offloaded to the factory {{within a few days}} of being caught. Or the fish can be caught by freezer trawlers that freeze the fish before providing it to factories, or by factory ships which can do the processing themselves on board. Some fish factories have fishing <b>vessels</b> <b>catching</b> fish for them at a given times of the year. This is to do with quotas and seasons conflicting how much and when the fish can be landed.|$|R

Finally, he finds himself gutting fish on a factory ship in the Bering Sea, in part to hide from the KGB, who have tried to kill him. The Soviet factory ship is part of a US-Soviet joint venture, with the US fishing <b>vessels</b> <b>catching</b> the fish and turning the catch over to the Soviets for processing (gutting, cleaning, and freezing).The other crew members have signed up with the prospect of a one-day stop at the United States fisheries port of Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands, with an extra salary allowance in US$ to let them purchase Western goods such as VCRs and cassette tapes.|$|R
5000|$|... {{captured}} Prudente on 9 February 1799 near Table Bay, Cape of Good Hope. At daybreak Daedalus spotted two sails {{and gave}} chase {{to the larger}} <b>vessel,</b> <b>catching</b> up with her at about 12:30. The quarry struck after an action of almost an hour. She {{proved to be the}} Prudente, which Captain H.L. Ball referred to as a French National frigate, rather than a privateer. She was pierced for 42 guns but was armed with twenty-six 12-pounder long guns on her main-deck and two long 6-pounders and two brass howitzers on her quarterdeck. She had a crew of 297 men. In the fight, Daedalus lost two men killed and 12 wounded. Prudente lost 27 men killed and 22 wounded. The ship in her company, which escaped, was an American vessel that she had taken as a prize.|$|R

The micro surgery is one of the big targets which M-S manipulator is expected to effectively perform. This paper describes about the human in the loop (HIL) simulator consisted of the prototype master manipulator and the virtual simulator of slave manipulator. Today, we have a challenge injecting drugs to a chick embryo’s blood vessels that are enough cultured in an artificial eggshell. The M-S manipulator is expected to apply for such a work like a micro surgery, ex. <b>catching</b> a blood <b>vessel</b> and sticking a cylinder. The embryo is extremely sensitive so that M-S manipulator should have both high operability and high accuracy movement. To evaluate the M-S manipulator quantitatively, we develop the human in the loop (HIL) simulator.

40|$|Virginia is a mid- 19 th century, southern-built {{schooner}} {{owned by}} the National Civil War Naval Museum in Columbus, Georgia. The ship's career throughout the Gulf of Mexico spanned more than 140 years, first as an oyster schooner in Mobile Bay and ending as a commercial fishing <b>vessel</b> <b>catching</b> red snapper off of Florida's west coast. Presently, the ship remains in museum storage awaiting a well-developed plan for proposed restoration. Lack of historical evidence for the vessel's Civil War affiliated activities complicates present plans for the vessel at this institution.   Each facet of this project contributes to the overarching problem of addressing Virginia's ongoing preservation. During its expansive working history, the schooner underwent countless repairs and modifications, {{some of which are}} discernible in contemporary material. Documenting these, while also noting preservation concerns, was the primary focus of fieldwork which combined traditional methods with advanced terrestrial recording equipment. Virtual representations of construction and historic forms were generated from measured sketches and collected three-dimensional data.   M. A...|$|R
40|$|The Norwegian fish {{processing}} industry {{is an old}} industry and organising of production has been solved by fishing <b>vessels</b> <b>catching</b> fish and selling it fresh directly to processing plants located on shore close to the richest fishing areas. During the last decade an increasing part of the catch has been frozen on board. This change in supply, from fresh to frozen fish, has triggered investments in new cold storage plants along the Norwegian coast. These changes are about to change the entire market for raw materials and also the {{fish processing}} industry itself. Technological changes among the suppliers have created a totally new competitive position for the processing plants. In the new competitive setting {{one of the most}} valuable resources among the processing plants, i. e. a location close to fishing areas, is devaluated. The bargaining power to the local processing plants is decreased mainly because new entrants have achieved easier access to the local raw material market...|$|R
5000|$|Minke whales {{were first}} {{exploited}} by Greenlanders off western Greenland in 1948, when a fishing vessel mounted with a harpoon cannon began <b>catching</b> them. This <b>vessel</b> averaged 18 whales per annum (range four to 32), before being joined by three other vessels in 1958. The {{number of vessels}} participating in the hunt each year increased rapidly, rising from 18 in 1963, to 25 in 1964, and to 45 in 1965. The peak was reached in 1968 and 1969, with 56 vessels active in both years. From 1970 to 1976 the average fluctuated between about 30 and 45 vessels. A total of 3,434 minke whales were taken off western Greenland between 1948 and 1976, with a peak of 315 reached in 1968. The vast majority of these whales were taken by fishing vessels normally targeting cod, shrimp, or salmon, but an increasing number in later years were caught using {{a number of small}} boats with out-board motors, armed with high-powered rifles for killing the whale and hand-held harpoons and floating bladders to secure them; walkie-talkies were used for coordination. Usage of this method, called a [...] "collective catch", increased from a catch of just one whale in 1970 to 59 in 1975.|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{developed a}} spatially explicit, individual-based model (IBM) evaluating the bio-economic efficiency of fishing vessel movements between regions {{according to the}} catching and targeting of different species based on the most recent high resolution spatial fishery data. The main purpose was to test the effects of alternative fishing effort allocation scenarios related to fuel consumption, energy efficiency (value per litre of fuel), sustainable fish stock harvesting, and profitability of the fisheries. The assumption here was constant underlying resource availability. Now, an advanced version couples the vessel model to selected size-based population models and considers the underlying resource dynamics in the distribution and density patterns of the targeted stocks for the cases of Danish and German vessels harvesting the North Sea and Baltic fish stocks. The stochastic fishing process includes direct and local depletion by stock that is specific to the <b>vessel</b> <b>catching</b> power, which {{is proportional to the}} encountered size-based population on the visited ground and is based on stock assessment and research survey data. The impact of the potential fishing effort displacement by vessels on the fish stocks, with resulting fishing mortality, and the vessels’ economic consequences are evaluated on high spatial and seasonal disaggregation levels by simulating different individual choices of vessel speed, fishing grounds and ports. All tested scenarios led to increased overall energy efficiency, except for the fishing closures that increased fuel consumption and costs for most of the vessels due to increased travel distance. On an individual scale, the simulations led to gains and losses due to either the technical interactions between vessels exploiting the same stocks or to the alteration of individual fishing patterns. We demonstrate that integrating the spatial activity of vessels and local fish stock abundance dynamics allow for interactions and more realistic predictions of fishermen behaviour, revenues and stock abundance...|$|R
40|$|An {{estimated}} 350 dolphins were incidentally {{caught between}} late 2003 and 2009 in the Pilbara trawl fishery, north-western Australia. Data from skipper logbooks and independent observers {{were used to}} assess spatial and temporal patterns of dolphin bycatch in this fishery. Both datasets indicated that dolphins were caught throughout all four of the fishery management areas (total area ca. 13, 000 km 2), across all depths, and all year-round. However, based on a smaller number of trawls, independent observer records better explained the variation in dolphin bycatch than did the skipper logbooks. The most significant predictors of dolphin bycatch were: (1) which vessel was fishing, with one of the four <b>vessels</b> <b>catching</b> the greatest proportion of dolphins; (2) the time of day of fishing activity (corrected for effort, the lowest dolphin capture rate occurred between 00 : 00 and 05 : 59 when the least fishing occurred); and (3) whether nets included bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) (there was a 50 % reduction in dolphin bycatch after the introduction of BRDs). Nevertheless, concurrent research using underwater video footage collected within actively fishing trawl nets indicated that BRDs with bottom-opening escape hatches lead to the under-estimation of bycatch as some dead dolphins fall out during the trawl and are thus not recorded on deck. These results suggest that spatial or seasonal adjustments to trawling effort, other than an overall reduction in fishing across the fishery, would be unlikely to reduce dolphin bycatch rates. Trials of BRDs with top-opening escape hatches, from which air-breathing megafauna might escape, have been recommended, with both observers and underwater video camera deployments to validate the design’s efficacy. The vulnerability of this dolphin population to the current level of trawling remains unknown without information on dolphin abundance and the genetic connectivity of this population with adjacent populations...|$|R
60|$|It {{was not at}} all late {{when the}} Wallingford was slowly {{approaching}} the wharf where it was intended to bring-up. There was a sloop ahead of us, which we had been gradually approaching for the last two hours, but which was enabled to keep in advance in consequence of the lightness of the wind. This dying away of the breeze rendered the approaching noon-tide calm and pleasant; and everybody in-board, even to Grace, came on deck, as we moved slowly past the dwellings on the eastern bank, {{in order to get a}} view of the town. I proposed that the Clawbonny party should land, contrary to our original intention, and profit by the opportunity to see the political capital of the State at our leisure. Both Grace and Lucy were inclined to listen favourably; and the Drewetts, Andrew and his sisters, were delighted at this prospect of our remaining together a little longer. Just at this moment, the Wallingford, true to her character, was coming up with the sloop ahead, and was already doubling on her quarter. I was giving some orders, when Lucy and Chloe, supporting Grace, passed me on their way to the cabin. My poor sister was pale as death, and I could see that she trembled so much she could hardly walk. A significant glance from Lucy bade me not to interfere, and I hid sufficient self-command to obey. I turned to look at the neighbouring sloop, and found at once an explanation of my sister's agitation. The Mertons and Rupert were on her quarter-deck, and so near as to render it impossible to avoid speaking, at least to the former. At this embarrassing instant Lucy returned to my side, with a view, as I afterwards learned, to urge me to carry the Wallingford to some place so distant, as to remove the danger of any intercourse. This accident rendered the precaution useless, the whole party in the other <b>vessel</b> <b>catching</b> sight of my companion at the same moment.|$|R
