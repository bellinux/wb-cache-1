Almost all MDM products support easy integration with Exchange Server (2003/2007/2010), Office365, Lotus Notes, BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) and others. This provides the flexibility of configuring email over the air. Secure Docs: Employees frequently <b>copy</b> <b>attachments</b> downloaded from corporate email to their personal devices and then misuse it. MDM can restrict or disable clipboard usage into {{or out of the}} secure container, restrict forwarding of attachments to external domains, or prevent saving attachments on SD card. This ensures corporate data is secure.|$|R

30|$|In {{its most}} recent and most general {{formulation}} [31] the model of social learning in cultural evolution is, with just two parameters, capable of replicating any right skewed distribution and of accounting for the turnover which is observed in relative standings in any evolutionary environment. One parameter describes the relative frequencies with which preferential <b>attachment</b> (<b>copying)</b> and innovation are used to make decisions, and the other describes the span of historical time used to observe the decisions which other agents have made. Clearly, this latter is different for a firm choosing its location to a teenager choosing which video to download from YouTube.|$|R
40|$|Most solid {{tumors are}} aneuploid, having a {{chromosome}} number {{that is not}} a multiple of the haploid number, and many frequently mis-segregate whole chromosomes in a phenomenon called chromosomal instability (CIN). CIN positively correlates with poor patient prognosis, indicating that reduced mitotic fidelity contributes to cancer progression by increasing genetic diversity among tumor cells. Here, we review the mechanisms underlying CIN, which include defects in chromosome cohesion, mitotic checkpoint function, centrosome <b>copy</b> number, kinetochore–microtubule <b>attachment</b> dynamics, and cell-cycle regulation. Understanding these mechanisms provides insight into the cellular consequences of CIN and reveals the possibility of exploiting CIN in cancer therapy...|$|R
40|$|Please {{accept and}} fully {{consider}} these scoping comments {{on behalf of}} The Wilderness Society and the other organizations identified below. The Wilderness Society’s more than 300, 000 members and supporters nationwide care deeply about the management of our public lands. Founded in 1935, {{our mission is to}} protect wilderness and inspire Americans to care for our wild places. We appreciate the opportunity to submit these comments to the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service on the Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) for Geothermal Energy. We are submitting these comments today via electronic mail and also forwarding a <b>copy</b> with <b>attachments</b> to you separately. We support development of clean, renewable energy resources because doing so promotes nonpolluting, sustainable energy production that will benefit Americans and our public lands in the long term and encourages a move from a fossil fuels-based economy to a renewables-based economy. While we recognize geothermal energy can contribute to a clean energy economy and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, like all energy production on public lands, geothermal resources must be developed responsibly and in a sustainable manner. This is of special importance in the western states which comprise the planning area, where water is a finit...|$|R
40|$|Invitations from World Bank President Robert S. McNamara {{to attend}} a meeting in January 1971 {{regarding}} long-term support for international agricultural research. The record includes samples of a letter of invitation McNamara addressed on November 19, 1970 to eight heads of foundations and multilateral organizations, and the Ambassador of Switzerland to the United States, and a parallel memorandum to fourteen Bank executive directors. UNDP and FAO joined with the World Bank in sponsoring the meeting. Also included is a memorandum to McNamara from Richard Demuth of the Bank, attaching a copy of McNamara's memorandum of October 30, 1970 to the Bank's Executive Directors, {{a draft of the}} proposed invitation, and <b>copies</b> of the <b>attachments.</b> The latter consist of a summary report of the Bellagio meeting in February 1970 of agriculturalists from development assistance agencies, a provisional agenda, a list of invitees, and a draft statement of the objectives, composition and organizational structure of a proposed international agricultural research consultative group...|$|R
