50|$|The total global {{production}} of farmed shrimp reached 2.5 million tonnes in 2005. This accounts for 42% {{of the total}} shrimp production that year (farming and wild catches combined). The largest single market for shrimp is the United States, importing between 500 - 600,000 tonnes of shrimp products yearly in the years 2003-2009. About 200,000 tonnes yearly are imported by Japan, while the European Union imported in 2006 another about 500,000 tonnes of tropical shrimps, with the largest importers being Spain and France. The EU also is a major importer of coldwater shrimp from catches, mainly <b>common</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Crangon crangon) and Pandalidae such as Pandalus borealis; in 2006, these imports accounted for about another 200,000 tonnes.|$|E

50|$|The terms {{shrimp and}} prawn {{originated}} in Great Britain. In {{the use of}} common names for species, shrimp is applied to smaller species, particularly species that are dorsoventrally depressed (wider than deep) with a shorter rostrum. It is the only term used for species in the family Crangonidae, such as the <b>common</b> <b>shrimp</b> or brown shrimp, Crangon crangon. Prawn is never applied to very small species. It is applied {{to most of the}} larger forms, particularly species that are laterally compressed (deeper than wide) and have a long rostrum. However, the terms are not used consistently. For example, some authors refer to Pandalus montagui as an Aesop shrimp while others refer to it as an Aesop prawn.|$|E
40|$|Fykes {{were used}} to monitor the fish and {{crustacean}} fauna of the mudflats of the Zeeschelde between April 1995 and December 1996. Overall 38 species were recorded; {{the number of species}} was greater in the brackish water part than in the fresh water part probably due to reduced oxygen concentrations in {{the upper reaches of the}} river. In terms of wet weight, just 6 species accounted for more than 96 % of the total annual catch. These species are shore crab, eel, flounder, <b>common</b> <b>shrimp,</b> sole and bass.

40|$|Secondary {{metabolites}} {{of marine}} sponge Dendrilla nigra were tested {{for determining the}} efficacy of controlling shrimp bacterial pathogens. Based on the exploratory experiments, the chosen dose of D. nigra (500 mg/kg of shrimp) was used for pilot experiment. The percent relative protection (PRP) of shrimps treated with Dendrilla feed and challenged with various concentrations of bacterial pathogen was evaluated. Dendrilla feed elicited complete protection (100 % survival) against the most <b>common</b> <b>shrimp</b> pathogens such as luminescent Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio alginolyticus. Results of combined bacterial challenge indicated that Dendrilla was a broad spectrum vibriostatic agent. Invariably, the survival of treated shrimp against the bacterial infection was significant at p< 0. 01 level. Based on the present findings, it could be inferred that the secondary metabolites of D. nigra form an excellent source for developing potent antibacterial agents to combat bacterial diseases of shrimp and replace the conventional antibiotic...|$|E

Each EU Member State has its own Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), which is a sea area defined in International Law that extends up to 200 nautical miles from the coast of the EU Member State. Within the EU, Member States have equal access to EU fishing grounds. Dutch fisheries are highly dependent on the UK EEZ, where (pelagic) trawlers in particular, targeting herring and mackerel, are highly active (Figure 1).

40|$|Litopenaeus vannamei, {{which is}} the most <b>common</b> <b>shrimp</b> species {{cultivated}} in the northeast of Brazil, is very susceptible to microbial diseases, and this consequently affects productivity. There are reports of bacteria, viruses and protozoa in these shrimp, but not fungi. This study aims to isolate and identify fungi present in shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei, and in their nursery waters, at two breeding farms in Brazil. The pathogenic potential of the isolates was assessed through the qualitative detection of proteases and aflatoxin B production. The 146 isolated fungi comprised 46 species. Aspergillus, Penicillium and Furarium were the three most relevant genera and Aspergillus flavus was the predominant species with a total of 33 isolates. Most of the isolated species are known as potentially pathogenic to humans and other animals. Eighteen isolates of A. flavus and two of A. parasiticus were able to produce aflatoxin B and 33 out of the 46 species produced protease, indicating that these fungi may also become pathogenic to shrimp and their consumers...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Monodon {{baculovirus}} (MBV) is {{a member}} of the nucleopolyhedrosis virus (NPV) group that produces polyhedral protein occlusion bodies that contain virions in epithelial cells of the hepatopancreas of the peinaeid shrimp Penaeus monodon. The major constituent protein of occlusion bodies is polyhedrin. Polyhedrin protein of MBV was extracted from the infected hepatopancreas of P. monodon post larvae by hydroforce and partially purified using Urografin gradient ultracentrifugation. A fraction at 50 % Urografin was examined by electron microscopy and shown to be dominated by polyhedrin protein particles of 20 - 23 nm diameter. By SDS-PAGE, this fraction yielded a single protein band at a molecular weight of 58 kDa corresponding to the published size of MBV polyhedrin. This fraction was used to produce 17 monoclonal antibodies (MAb) that were specific to MBV and without cross-reactivity to other <b>common</b> <b>shrimp</b> viruses (i. e, hepatopancreatic parvovirus or HPV, yellow head virus or YHV and white spot syndrome virus or WSSV) by immunohistochemistry.

40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>shrimp</b> trawl designs {{employed}} in the southeastern United States shrimp fishery are the flat, balloon, semiballoon, jib, and super X- 3. Recent innovations in trawl design and rigging, including the twin trawl rigging and tongue trawl design, have improved the efficiency of shrimp trawling gear. A description of the construction techniques for the different designs indicate differences which affect gear performance. Measurements of horizontal spread and vertical opening for 76 trawl configurations indicate the relative efficiencies of the different designs. Maximum horizontal spreading efficiency was achieved by the "twin" and "tongue" trawl designs followed by the super X- 3, jib, balloon, and semiballoon designs. Designs having the greatest vertical openings were the tongue and flat trawl designs followed by the semiballoon. Maximum total gape dimension was demonstrated by the "Mongoose" tongue trawl. Comparison of trawl spreading efficiency and door area to headrope length ratio indicates that a range of 70 - 80 in square (per door) of door area is required for each foot of trawl headrope length for maximum efficiency with conventional trawl designs and 66 - 75 in square per foot of headrope for tongue trawl designs.

40|$|International audienceBivalve mussels {{are usually}} used for {{biomonitoring}} persistent toxic substances (PTS) in coastal ecosystems. Nevertheless, these organisms, which live attached on hard substrates, {{can be found}} along the sandy coasts only on human manufactured products. In this work different species collected in the Gulf of Gdańsk were compared to evaluate their suitability for monitoring PTS pollution at a local scale. The clam Mya arenaria seems to represent an excellent indicator of sediment pollution, mainly for organotin compounds which are selectively bioaccumulated. Organochlorine compounds are bioaccumulated in the different species mainly in function of their lipid body burden. Habitat conditions (salinity, substrate, pollution), however, strongly limited the occurrence of different species in the sampling sites; the most ubiquitous species, the <b>common</b> <b>shrimp</b> Crangon crangon, resulted therefore the most suitable {{to be used for}} the comparison of PTS pollution in this aquatic environment.

40|$|Carbon {{capture and}} storage (CCS) in sub-sea {{geological}} formations {{is being developed}} and promoted to mitigate CO 2 discharges to the atmosphere from point sources such as power stations. There remain some questions on {{the risks associated with}} the possible loss of gas from storage and the environmental harm this could pose to marine organisms associated with the sea bed in these regions. This study investigated the effect of exposing the <b>common</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Crangon crangon) to reduced pH conditions and presents the results of stepwise pH-reductions (0. 2 pH units from pH 7 down to pH 6). Behaviour was monitored continuously throughout 8 hours of exposure. In three subsequent experiments we could show a consistent and repeatable behavioural response pattern consisting of immediate avoidance reactions expressed as “shooting behaviour” following each pH-reduction every hour. The animals responded in a rapid manner to the shifts at all pH values, suggesting that these animals are sensitive to even relatively small changes. The results indicate that repeated acute pH-stress caused by CO 2 -leakage from carbon storage sites might affect the behaviour and subsequent fitness of natural populations of common shrimps. Changes in behaviour are likely to lead to increased predation on these animals and migration away from affected areas. </p...|$|E
40|$|Various benthic {{invertebrates}} (flying crab, <b>common</b> <b>shrimp,</b> and red starfish), small fish (sand goby), benthic flatfish (dab, plaice, and sole) and gadoids (bib and whiting) {{were collected in}} the Belgian North Sea and along the Scheldt Estuary, both representing areas impacted by various contaminants to different degrees. The levels of 25 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and 15 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), which included penta- and hexachlorobenzene, alpha-, bèta-, and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane isomers, chlordanes, and DDT and metabolites, were determined. Sum of PCBs and OCPs in {{benthic invertebrates}} and goby ranged from 1. 5 to 280 ng/g wet weight (ww) and from 0. 27 to 23 ng/g ww, respectively. The fish livers revealed total PCB and OCP levels ranging from 20 to 3200 ng/g ww and from 6. 0 to 410 ng/g ww, respectively. Levels of both contaminant groups were significantly higher in samples from the Scheldt Estuary compared to the Belgian North Sea.

40|$|The {{results of}} a 25 -year study of the {{population}} dynamics of the <b>common</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Crangon crangon, in the Bristol Channel are presented. The population size varied seasonally, with maximum abundance occurring in early autumn {{at the completion of}} annual recruitment. The number of recruits changed greatly between years, and was positively correlated with both average water temperature from January to August, and river £ow rate, and negatively correlated with theWinter North Atlantic Oscillation Index. A wide range of other physical and biotic variables was found to have no signi¢cant impact on C. crangon abundance. The positive relationship between temperature and C. crangon abundance observed for the Atlantic coast during this study is the opposite of that found for southern North Sea populations. Similar contradictory responses have been noted previously for £at¢sh such as sole, Solea solea. This suggests that global variables may act to produce di¡erent outcomes for Atlantic and North Sea populations of the same species. Over-winter mortality was found to vary with population size so that the adult C. crangon population in spring was found to be remarkably stable, and little in£uenced by temperature or other variables. The mortality rate increased with population size producing clear evidence of density-dependent control. It is suggested that this stability is linked to the constant limited availability of suitable habitat, with individuals unable to ¢nd shelter vulnerable to a range of predatory ¢sh.
