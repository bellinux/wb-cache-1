40|$|Sea surface {{temperature}} (SST) datasets have been generated from satellite observations {{for the period}} 1991 – 2010, intended for use in climate science applications. Attributes of the datasets specifically relevant to <b>climate</b> <b>applications</b> are: first, independence from in situ observations; second, effort to ensure homogeneity and stability through the time-series; third, context-specific uncertainty estimates attached to each SST value; and, fourth, provision of estimates of both skin SST (the fundamental measure- ment, relevant to air-sea fluxes) and SST at standard depth and local time (partly model mediated, enabling comparison with his- torical in situ datasets). These attributes in part reflect requirements solicited from climate data users prior to and during the project. Datasets consisting of SSTs on satellite swaths are derived from the Along-Track Scanning Radiometers (ATSRs) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRRs). These are then used as sole SST inputs to a daily, spatially complete, analysis SST product, with a latitude-longitude resolution of 0. 05 °C and good discrimination of ocean surface thermal features.

By combining observations of a hydro-dynamically unstable flow with a 3 D numerical fluid model, we obtain a real-time {{estimate of the}} state of the evolving fluid which is better than either model or observations alone. To the best of our knowledge this is the first such observatory for laboratory simulations of planetary flows that functions in real time. New algorithms in modeling, parameter and state estimation, and observation targeting can be rapidly validated, thus making weather and <b>climate</b> <b>application</b> accessible to computational scientists. Properties of the fluid that cannot be directly observed can be effectively studied by a constrained model, thus facilitating scientific inquiry. ...|$|R

The <b>climate</b> change <b>application</b> community comprises researchers and other specialists who use climate information (alongside socioeconomic and other environmental information) to analyze vulnerability, impacts and adaptation of natural systems and society in relation to past, ongoing and projected future climate change.

40|$|To {{generate}} {{information about}} the monsoon onset and withdrawal we have to choose a monsoon definition {{and apply it to}} data. One problem that arises is that false monsoon onsets can hamper our analysis, which is often alleviated by smoothing the data in time or space. Another problem is that local communities or stakeholder groups may define the monsoon differently. We therefore aim to develop a technique that reduces false onsets for high-resolution gridded data, while also being flexible for different requirements that can be tailored to particular end-users. In this study, we explain how we developed our technique and demonstrate how it successfully reduces false onsets and withdrawals. The presented results yield improved {{information about the}} monsoon length and its interannual variability.
