5|$|The militia {{garrison}} {{artillery and}} engineers were required throughout the war, however, to man the coastal defences. Despite {{the fact that}} after 1915 {{it was decided that}} only small garrisons were required on active service, the militia was ordered to maintain their readiness in case they were required to be <b>called</b> <b>out</b> and such was the importance placed upon their role that to a large extent they were barred from joining the AIF for overseas service. In February 1916 a large-scale effort by militia artillerymen to enlist in the artillery units that were being raised for the 3rd Division was prevented when they were <b>called</b> <b>out</b> to man the coastal defences due to the threat posed by a German commerce raider that was believed to be in the Pacific. This mobilisation lasted until April 1916, when the garrisons were again reduced and the ban on men serving in militia artillery and engineer units volunteering for overseas service was lifted.|$|E
