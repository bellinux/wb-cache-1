50|$|The <b>condition</b> <b>index</b> in fish {{is a way}} {{to measure}} the overall health of a fish by {{comparing}} its weight with the typical weight of other fish of the same kind and of the same length. The <b>condition</b> <b>index</b> is its actual weight divided by its expected weight, times 100%. A fish of normal weight has a <b>condition</b> <b>index</b> of 100 percent. So if a tarpon, for example, has a <b>condition</b> <b>index</b> of 104 percent, that would mean it is above the normal weight for an average tarpon of that length. If a tarpon has a <b>condition</b> <b>index</b> of 92 percent, that would mean that it is thinner, or below the normal weight of other tarpon that length. The <b>condition</b> <b>index</b> depends on how much a fish is eating compared to the energy it has to spend to live, migrate, reproduce, and do its other activities. The <b>condition</b> <b>index</b> for fish is a simple measurement {{that can be used to}} provide important biological information that can then be used to make better management decisions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reference}} weight-length {{formula is}} used to calculate how much the individual fish would be expected to weigh based on its measured length. Then the <b>condition</b> <b>index</b> is the actual weight of the fish divided by its expected weight, times 100%. A <b>condition</b> <b>index</b> greater than 100% means the individual fish weighs more than expected, while a <b>condition</b> <b>index</b> less than 100% means the individual fish weighs less than expected for its length. Since the <b>condition</b> <b>index</b> {{is used to}} assess the health of fish, {{it is important to have}} a reliable reference weight-length relationship.|$|E

While these <b>condition</b> <b>indices</b> {{have been widely used}} to address questions in evolutionary ecology and conservation biology, the ability of such indices to predict ecologically relevant locomotor performance abilities remains unknown. We show here that the functional links between six commonly used morphological <b>condition</b> <b>indices</b> and locomotor performance in two populations of Adriatic lizards (Podarcis sicula) are weak at best. Indeed, no indices consistently predict either maximum sprint speed or maximum exertion across sexes, seasons or populations. These results cast doubt on the ecological relevance of morphological <b>condition</b> <b>indices</b> in terms of locomotor performance, measured in laboratory conditions, at least in this species. We urge caution in using <b>condition</b> <b>indices</b> as proxies for individual physiological or phenotypic quality in ecological and evolutionary studies...|$|R

The empirical findings show that TCI weighted by spillovers reveal greater significance in forecasting the Composite Index (CI), an economic environmental indicator, than the Tourism Industry Index (TII), which is an existing indicator for the tourism industry that is listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE).

40|$|The authors {{construct}} three financial <b>conditions</b> <b>indexes</b> (FCIs) for Canada {{based on}} three approaches: an IS-curve-based model, generalized impulse-response functions, and factoranalysis. Each approach {{is intended to}} address one or more criticisms of the monetary <b>conditions</b> <b>index</b> (MCI) and existing FCIs. To evaluate their three FCIs, the authors consider five performance criteria: the consistency of each FCI's weight with economic theory, its graphical ability to predict turning points in the business cycle, its dynamic correlation with output, its in-sample fit in explaining output, and its out-of-sample performance in forecasting output. Using monthly data, the authors find, in general, that housing prices, equity prices, and bond yield risk premiums, in addition to short- and long-term interest rates and the exchange rate, are significant in explaining output from 1981 to 2000. They also find that the FCIs outperform the Bank of Canada's MCI in many areas. Monetary and financial indicators; Monetary <b>conditions</b> <b>index...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to review and {{interpret}} the use of a Monetary <b>Conditions</b> <b>Index</b> (or MCI) by central banks in the conduct of monetary policy.
