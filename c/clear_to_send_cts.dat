If nodes A and B are both wireless laptop computers communicating {{in an office}} environment their physical separation may require that they communicate through {{a wireless}} access point.

30|$|The two-way {{handshaking}} {{technique for}} packet transmission described above is called basic access mechanism, {{as shown in}} Fig. 1. DCF also defines an optional four-way handshaking technique for packet transmission. This mechanism, also known as RTS/CTS, is shown in Fig. 2. A station that has a packet queued for transmission follows the back-off rules explained above, but instead of transmitting the packet it preliminarily transmits a special short frame called request-to-send (RTS). When the destination detects an RTS frame, it responds after an SIFS time period with a <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> (<b>CTS)</b> frame. The source is only allowed to transmit the data packet if the CTS frame is correctly received within a duration called CTS_ Timeout. The RTS threshold (RT) is a switch parameter for the RTS/CTS mechanism; four-way handshaking is used when the packet for transfer {{is larger than the}} RT value, otherwise two-way handshaking is used.|$|E

The protocol is a simplified {{version of the}} well known MACA (Multiple Access Collision Avoidance) based on the Request to Send/Clear to Send (RTS/CTS) handshake.

MACA-BI, preserving the data collision free property, is more robust than MACA to problems such as protocol failures (control packet collision and corruption) and finite turn-around time. Analytic results for a 1 Mbps single-hop far-field wireless network, and simulation results for a 10 Mbps multi-hop near-field ATM wireless indoor network, show that MACA-BI outperforms other multiple access protocols in high speed, steady traffic environments (e. g.

30|$|We {{talk about}} a hidden node problem when a node that {{is not able to}} sense the signal {{transmitted}} by an another neighboring node (the hidden node) operating at the same channel, and hence, it assumes that the medium is free and transmits. The simultaneously transmitted signals interfere at the receiving node causing a failure in the reception process. As a solution to this problem, an exchange of request to send (RTS) and <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> (<b>CTS)</b> frames is described in the IEEE 802.11 standard. However, as widely highlighted in the literature [31], the RTS/CTS mechanism introduces an important overhead and reduces the capacity of the network in terms of throughput since each node has to transmit the RTS and wait for the CTS response before any transmission. Furthermore, in specific scenarios, this mechanism fails to eliminate hidden nodes [32]. In this study, we experiment the performance of our solution in solving the hidden node problem without using the RTS/CTS.|$|E
30|$|In multi-hop communications, {{broadcast}} storm {{is a serious}} problem. The circulation of broadcast messages around the network may consume all available bandwidth and saturate the network [11 – 14].

This may lead to severe interference between {{the two types of}} messages. The situation is further exacerbated by the strict packet transmission requirements of the safety messages (with a packet generation frequency of 1 − 10 Hz) that results in hidden node collisions [16, 17]. Since broadcast mechanism in the IEEE 802.11 standard [18] does not have a request to send (RTS) and <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> (<b>CTS),</b> hidden node collisions cannot be detected. In this case, many redundant multi-hop retransmissions are required, which contribute to increasing the multi-hop dissemination delay and adversely affecting the reception rate of safety messages [19].|$|E

50|$|Although CSMA/CA {{has been}} used in a variety of wired {{communication}} systems, it is particularly beneficial in a wireless LAN due to a common problem of multiple stations being able to see the Access Point, but not each other. This is due to differences in transmit power, and receive sensitivity, as well as distance, and location with respect to the AP. This will cause a station to not be able to 'hear' another station's broadcast. This is the so-called 'hidden node', or 'hidden station' problem. Devices utilizing 802.11 based standards can enjoy the benefits of collision avoidance (RTS / CTS handshake, also Point coordination function), although they do not do so by default. By default they use a Carrier sensing mechanism called 'exponential backoff', or (Distributed coordination function) that relies upon a station attempting to 'listen' for another station's broadcast before sending.
