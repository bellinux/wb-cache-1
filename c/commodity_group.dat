5000|$|One of {{the main}} establishments created at this period was the {{metallurgical}} factory Ponta da Areia (In English: Sand Tip), {{in the city of}} Niterói, that also constructed steamships. It is likely that the textile industry benefited most by the virtue of being the oldest in the country. It first appeared in 1826, in the city of Recife, capital of the province of Pernambuco. The textile sector was quite dynamic in the monarchic period and received large investments until 1890, when it entered into decline. Various modernizations occurred, principally between 1840 and 1860, when factories {{with a high level of}} technological capability were created, able to compete with other major international centers. Other improvements came with the establishment of factories and forges geared for the production of equipment and pieces for textile manufacture. Moreover, Ready-made clothing is a major <b>commodity</b> <b>group</b> in the Brazilian exports of textile and garment industry its share is $742 million, or 35% of the total volume of exported manufactured goods. The concentration of industry that emerged in the province of Bahia considerably expanded its economic scope, reaching the south of Ceará, Piauí and even Minas Gerais.The extinction of the traffic in African slaves in 1850, contrary to what many authors allege, did not [...] "liberate" [...] credit for industrial development. That claim has no documentary basis whatever. On the contrary, capital employed in the trade was had already been directed to sectors such as enterprises of urban services, transport, banking and trade. But it is possible that there was an indirect contribution to the growth of the industrial sector through banking loans. In 1850, there were 50 factories with a capital of at least Rs 7.000:000$000.The imperial government created several incentives for the industrialization of the country. The earliest of these date from the reign of Dom Pedro I, through awards of government grants. The first establishment to receive such a grant was the Fábrica das Chitas (In English: Chitas Factory), devoted to paper and printing, by a decree of 26 June 1826. The practice was resumed in the 1840s, when new industrial establishments received subsidies. in 1857, seven factories benefited from this practice of incentives, among them, the Ponta da Areia mentioned above and that was owned by Irineu Evangelista de Sousa (later Viscount of Mauá). One of the criteria for the granting of these subsidies was the exclusive employment of free workers. The goal, then, was not only the transition from the old colonial economic system to that of the modern capitalist, but also from slave labor to free. Other incentives arose, such as the decree of 8 August 1846 that exempted manufactured products from certain transport taxes (internally as well as externally), shielded from military recruitament a determinate number of employees of industrial establishments and eliminated tariffs on parts and machinery imported for textile factories. The following year in June, a new decree stated that all industrial establishments on national soil would be free of taxes on imported raw materials. Thus, production costs of domestic industry dropped considerably, allowing it to compete with foreign products. The Alves Branco tariff underwent modification in 1857, reducing to 15% the tax on imported products. Later, under the Rio Branco cabinet at the beginning of the 1870s, the tariff on foreign products was newly raised to 40%, and new raw materials were exempted from import taxes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the household consumption patterns separately for the urban and the rural sectors in Pakistan by estimating the marginal expenditure shares and expenditure elasticities, for twelve broad <b>commodity</b> <b>groups,</b> using household level {{data for the}} year 1984 - 85. At the sectoral level, the marginal expenditure shares are estimated both with and without the 'community effect'. Furthermore, by dividing households within each sector into different income groups, income-specific marginal expenditure shares and elasticities are also obtained. This level of disaggregation reveals much richer consumption patterns {{as compared to the}} ones based on grouped data. The estimated marginal expenditure shares indicate that in examining the household consumption patterns one can safely assume that all the households in the sample face the same price structure. While the findings of the paper support the validity of Engel's Law, the estimates presented indicate that expenditure elasticities for different <b>commodity</b> <b>groups</b> vary with income and, in general, exhibit a cyclical pattern, which is explained in terms of quantitative as well as qualitative changes in the households' consumption basket. For a majority of the <b>commodity</b> <b>groups,</b> both structural and behavioural differences in the consumption patterns are found to exist between the urban and the rural households. Furthermore, our results also confirm the existence of economies of scale in the consumption of majority of the <b>commodity</b> <b>groups.</b> The degrees of these economies of scale are not only different across commodities but also between sectors and across the income groups within each sector. ...|$|R
