5000|$|The {{third part}} of the book is {{dedicated}} to the evolution of democracy since 1945. In Keane's view, after World War II, democracy has entered a new phase, which he calls monitory democracy. He explains that {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century, the representative model faced its deepest crisis. Parliaments proved to be not strong enough to defend democracy from economic collapse and the rise of various forms of dictatorial and totalitarian rule. The system of representative democracy based purely on representation showed its limits and fragility; the use of mass communication media (the press, the radio, and cinema) helped populist leaders like Mussolini and Hitler to gain consensus and almost destroy democracy has it had been hitherto known. The crisis in fact culminated in total war (1939-1945) and 'near-destruction worldwide of democratic institutions and ways of life by the storms of mechanised war, dictatorship and totalitarian rule'. After World War II, alongside parliamentary politics (typical of the representative model), [...] "many different kinds of extra-parliamentary, power-scrutinising mechanisms" [...] emerged. Keane calls these mechanisms [...] "monitory bodies"; they function both from within the state and cross-borders. The emergence of monitory bodies have transformative effects on the core institutions of representative democracy: nation states are still important, but power-holders (representatives) are subject increasingly to unprecedented scrutiny from within and across borders, and outside the <b>conventional</b> <b>mechanism</b> of periodic elections and parliamentary representation.|$|E
5000|$|Catalyst {{transfer}} polycondensation {{allows for}} the living polymerization of π-conjugated polymers and was discovered by Tsutomu Yokozawa in 2004 [...] and Richard McCullough. This was further refined by Ted Pappenfus in 2008 {{with the addition of}} a Grignard catalyst to initiate polymerization. In CTP the propagation step is based on organic cross coupling reactions (i.e. Kumada coupling, Sonogashira coupling, Negishi coupling) top form carbon carbon bonds between difunctional monomers. When Yokozawa and McCullough independently discovered the polymerization using a metal catalyst to couple a Grignard reagent with an organohalide making a new carbon-carbon bond. The mechanism below shows the formation of poly(3-alkylthiophene) using a Ni initiator (Ln can be [...] 1,3-Bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (dppp)) and is similar to the <b>conventional</b> <b>mechanism</b> for Kumada coupling involving an oxidative addition, a transmetalation and a reductive elimination step. However, there is a key difference, following reductive elimination in CTP, an associative complex is formed (which has been supported by intra-/intermolecular oxidative addition competition experiments [...] ) and the subsequent oxidative addition occurs between the metal center and the associated chain (an intramolecular pathway). Whereas in a coupling reaction the newly formed alkyl/aryl compound diffuses away and the subsequent oxidative addition occurs between an incoming Ar-Br bond and the metal center. The associative complex is essential to for polymerization to occur in a living fashion since it allows the metal to undergo a preferred intramolecular oxidative addition and remain with a single propagating chain (consistent with chain-growth mechanism), as opposed to an intermolecular oxidative addition with other monomers present in the solution (consistent with a step-growth, non-living, mechanism). The monomer scope of CTP has been increasing since its discovery and has included poly(phenylene)s, poly(fluorine)s, poly(selenophene)s and poly(pyrrole)s.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Clustering {{mechanisms}} are crucial for scalable rout-ing in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). We have previously proposed an autonomous decentralized clustering mechanism {{that is based}} on differential equations. This method adopts both the diffusion effect for autonomous decentralized control, and the drift effect for balancing with the diffusion effect. In our <b>conventional</b> <b>mechanism,</b> we need to set the strength of diffu-sion effect stronger than the drift effect because fine tuning for balancing both effects is difficult. However, it results in a de-crease of the number of clusters by the diffusion effect, and it is a problem on forming sustainable cluster structures. We need the solution of this problem for clustering in MANET. In this paper, we propose a mechanism autonomously adjusting the effects of both diffusion and drift. We show that our proposed mechanism can form sustainable cluster structures reflecting the characteristic of our <b>conventional</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Finally, we eval-uate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism for an envi-ronment in which the fusion of subnetworks occurs.

40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that superconducting materials {{are divided into}} two classes: `conventional' and `unconventional'. Conventional superconductors (the elements and thousands of compounds including $MgB_ 2 $) are described by conventional London-BCS-Eliashberg electron-phonon theory.

40|$|The {{spectral}} shape of cosmic ray positrons and antiprotons has been accurately {{measured in the}} broad kinetic energy range 1 - 350 GeV. In the higher part of this range (E > 30 GeV) the e+ and pbar are both well described by power laws with spectral indices gamma[e+] = 2. 77 +- 0. 02 and gamma[pbar] = 2. 78 +- 0. 04 that are approximately equal {{to each other and}} to the spectral index of protons. In the same energy range the positron/antiproton flux ratio has the approximately constant value 2. 04 +- 0. 04, that is consistent with being equal to the ratio e_/pbar calculated for the <b>conventional</b> <b>mechanism</b> of production, where the antiparticles are created as secondaries in the inelastic interactions of primary cosmic rays with interstellar gas. The positron/antiproton ratio at lower energy is significantly higher (reaching the approximate value e+/pbar = 100 for E around 1 GeV), but in the entire energy range 1 - 350 GeV, the flux ratio is consistent with being equal to ratio of the production rates in the <b>conventional</b> <b>mechanism,</b> as the production of low energy antiprotons is kinematically suppressed in collisions with a target at rest.
