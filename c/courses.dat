50|$|<b>Course</b> {{equivalency}} is {{the term}} used in higher education describing how a <b>course</b> offered by one college or university relates to a <b>course</b> offered by another.

5|$|Some {{scheduling}} {{problems can}} be modeled as a question about finding graph homomorphisms. As an example, one might want to assign workshop <b>courses</b> to time slots in a calendar so that two <b>courses</b> attended by the same student are not too {{close to each other}} in time. The <b>courses</b> form a graph G, with an edge between any two <b>courses</b> that are attended by some common student. The time slots form a graph H, with an edge between any two slots that are distant enough in time. For instance, if one wants a cyclical, weekly schedule, such that each student gets their workshop <b>courses</b> on non-consecutive days, then H would be the complement graph of C7. A graph homomorphism from G to H is then a schedule assigning <b>courses</b> to time slots, as specified. To add a requirement saying that, e.g., no single student has <b>courses</b> on both Friday and Monday, it suffices to remove the corresponding edge from H.|$|E
