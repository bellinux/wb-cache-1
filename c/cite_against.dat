50|$|The IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin was a {{technical}} publication produced by IBM between 1958 and 1998. The {{purpose of the}} Bulletin was to disclose inventions that IBM did not want their competitors to get patents on. The Bulletin {{was a form of}} defensive publication. By publishing the details of how to make and use the invention, patent examiners could have a searchable source of prior art that they could <b>cite</b> <b>against</b> subsequent patent applications filed by others on the same or similar inventions.|$|E

50|$|Nicholas' {{opinions}} on the Empire, which he hoped to reform and strengthen, were <b>cited</b> <b>against</b> papal claims of temporal power in {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries. Protestant writers were happy to <b>cite</b> a cardinal <b>against</b> Rome's pretensions. Protestants, however, found his writings against the Hussites wrong. Nicholas seemed to Protestants to give the church too much power to interpret Scripture, instead of treating it as self interpreting and self-sufficient for salvation, the principle of sola scriptura.|$|R

5000|$|In 1994 Hoffmann {{published}} Porphyry: Against the Christians (the Literary Remains). Hoffmann's {{work is a}} new translation {{based on}} a 15th-century manuscript preserved by Macarius Magnes. The author of the criticisms in that manuscript is not known with certainty. The argument that the critic was Porphyry was first advanced by the historian Adolph von Harnack, though his theory been disputed.

5000|$|Passages in the Old Testament that {{prohibit}} man [...] "lie with mankind as with womankind" [...] {{and the story}} of Sodom and Gomorrah have historically been interpreted as condemning sodomy. Several Pauline passages have also been <b>cited</b> <b>against</b> male and female homosexuality. Christians who take a conservative position on homosexuality endorse this reading of these passages in the belief that God is against same-sex sexual activity, while Christians who take a liberal position believe that these same passages refer to more specific situations, such as rape or abuse, and not homosexuality.|$|R
5000|$|This {{has been}} {{compared}} to the Christian theological method of prooftexting: Pseudoscientists often reveal themselves by their handling of the scientific literature. Their idea of doing scientific research is simply to read scientific periodicals and monographs. They focus on words, not on the underlying facts and reasoning. They take science to be all statements by scientists. Science degenerates into a secular substitute for sacred literature. Any statement by any scientist can be <b>cited</b> <b>against</b> any other statement. Every statement counts and every statement is open to interpretation. Radner and Radner ...|$|R
2500|$|However, Pântea's own testimonies on the Holocaust subject have various ambiguities and omissions. Mark Mazower notes that, {{in writing}} his reports, Pântea never {{realized}} {{the level of}} Antonescu's involvement in the 1941 Massacre. Before the official recognition of Holocaust crimes, the Odessa Mayor's accounts were being <b>cited</b> <b>against</b> themselves by those who tried to minimize Romanian involvement. In reaction, Jewish community historian Teodor Wexler argued that the attempt was missing its target: [...] "Gherman Pântea's letter [...] of an unrestrained tragicalness", confirming [...] "once {{and for all the}} historical responsibility of those who dictated the undertaking of the Holocaust in Romania." ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{argues for}} (a) the {{existence}} of both abstract Case and morphological case, the latter realizing the former according to the Elsewhere Condition; and (b) the non-existence of abstract absolutive Case. A class of ergativeabsolutive nominative Case and transitive objects receive abstract accusative Case; both nominative and accusative are realized through a morphological default, the “absolutive”. Such languages behave systematically distinctly from ergativeabsolutive languages in which intransitive subjects and transitive objects both receive abstract nominative Case. The relationship between abstract and morphological case based on the Elsewhere Condition is further supported by case mismatches in Pama-Nyungan languages. The data standardly <b>cited</b> <b>against</b> such a relationship, Icelandic quirky case, are re-examined...|$|R
40|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding PGD has not abated in recent times. This is especially {{the case for}} PGD-based tissue typing, {{which is used to}} select a future child who could serve as a stem cell donor for an older sick sibling. We examine three types of ethical argument <b>cited</b> <b>against</b> PGD in general, and specifically against tissue-typing PGD. These arguments focus on the moral status of the early embryo, the eugenics issue, and the charge that the future child is being exploited. We conclude that none of these three arguments is unassailable, and that it is the reproductive freedom of couples considering PGD that should prevail...|$|R

In November 1911, he demanded an official scrutiny into the public contracts signed over by the new Petre P. Carp Conservative administration. He looked over Romanian Railways ledgers, investigated the collapse of Galați docks, and exposed the (allegedly overpriced) works on NMS Regele Carol and NMS România. Fleva was the first, and for long only, member of Parliament to note that Vintilă Brătianu, the National Liberal Mayor of Bucharest, was in a conflict of interest.

5000|$|In physics, a renormalon (a term {{suggested}} by 't Hooft) {{is a particular}} source of divergence seen in perturbative approximations to quantum field theories (QFT). When a formally divergent series in a QFT is summed using Borel summation, the associated Borel transform of the series can have singularities {{as a function of}} the complex transform parameter. The renormalon is a possible type of singularity arising in this complex Borel plane, and is a counterpart of an instanton singularity. Associated with such singularities, renormalon contributions are discussed in the context of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and usually have the power-like form [...] as functions of the momentum [...] (here [...] is the momentum cut-off).

40|$|The {{relative}} {{benefits of}} passive and active vibration suppression for large space structures (LSS) are discussed. The {{intent is to}} sketch the true ranges of applicability of these approaches using previously published technical results. It {{was found that the}} distinction between active and passive vibration suppression approaches is not as sharp as might be thought at first. The relative simplicity, reliability, and cost effectiveness touted for passive measures are vitiated by 'hidden costs' bound up with detailed engineering implementation issues and inherent performance limitations. At the same time, reliability and robustness issues are often <b>cited</b> <b>against</b> active control. It is argued that a continuum of vibration suppression measures offering mutually supporting capabilities is needed. The challenge is to properly orchestrate a spectrum of methods to reap the synergistic benefits of combined advanced materials, passive damping, and active control...|$|R
40|$|The call by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) for {{randomised}} controlled trials (RCTs) {{to prove}} the patient-relevant benefit of positron emission tomography (PET) is currently a controversial topic in Germany. From a methodological point of view there is essentially no difference between diagnostic procedures and therapeutic (drug or non-drug) interventions in proving their causal benefit. A broad consensus has been reached since the 1960 s (e. g. FDA regulations) that RCTs are the methodological gold standard for therapeutic interventions. Nevertheless, the same arguments that were <b>cited</b> <b>against</b> RCTs in assessing the benefit of therapeutic interventions are now used against RCTs in evaluating diagnostic tests (e. g. ethical problems, feasibility, etc.).
