50|$|Peregrinus maidis, {{known as}} the <b>corn</b> <b>planthopper,</b> is a species of insect in the order Hemiptera and the family Delphacidae. It is {{widespread}} throughout most tropical and subtropical regions on earth, including southern North America, South America, Africa, Australia, Southeast Asia and China. P. maidis are a commercially important pest of maize and its relatives. In addition to physical plant damage, P. maidis is the vector for several species-specific maize viruses, including maize stripe virus, maize mosaic virus and the non-pathogenic Peregrinus maidis reovirus.|$|E

Maize mosaic virus (MMV; Rhabdoviridae) is a plant nucleorhabdovirus {{transmitted}} in a persistent-propagative manner by the <b>corn</b> <b>planthopper,</b> Peregrinus maidis. The fitness of P. maidis developing on healthy or MMV-infected corn {{leaves from}} either young (less than 30 days old) or old (more than 58 days old) corn plants were examined. Since MMV is acquired {{at a low}} rate, the planthoppers that developed from the infected leaves were segregated into 2 categories as determined by ELISA tests; MMV-infected, and MMV-exposed. Planthoppers that developed on healthy leaves were deemed "unexposed" and used as a control. Mean developmental time of MMV-infected and unexposed planthoppers were not significant different; however, MMV-exposed planthoppers developed slightly, yet significantly slower than the previous two categories. Development on younger leaves was significantly faster compared to that on older leaves. Longevity was not significantly different. However, unexposed planthoppers were more fecund then both MMV-exposed and MMV-infected planthoppers, which displayed a similar reduced fecundity. Since the abundance of wing forms may vary in response to host-plant physiology, the influence of MMV on the production of macropters and brachypters was examined. The proportion macropters produced on young healthy and MMV-infected leaves were similar, but a significantly higher proportion macropters were produced on older MMV-infected leaves compared to healthy leaves of similar age. Our findings suggest MMV may indirectly influence the dispersal of the <b>corn</b> <b>planthopper</b> through host-plant infection...|$|E

Analysis of Acquisition and Titer of Maize Mosaic Rhabdovirus in Its Vector, Peregrinus maidis (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). Journal of Insect Science, 16, 8. doi: 10. 1093 /jisesa/iev 154 The <b>corn</b> <b>planthopper,</b> Peregrinus maidis (Ashmead) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), transmits Maize mosaic {{rhabdovirus}} (MMV), {{an important}} pathogen of maize and sorghum, in a persistent propagative manner. To {{better understand the}} vectorial capacity of P. maidis, we determined the efficiency of MMV acquisition by nymphal and adult stages, and characterized MMV titer through development. Acquisition efficiency, i. e., proportion of insects that acquired the virus, was determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and virus titer of individual insects was estimated by quantitative RT-PCR. Acquisition efficiency of MMV differed significantly between nymphs and adults. MMV titer increased significantly over time and throughout insect development from nymphal to adult stage, indication of virus replication in the vector during development. There was a positive association between the vector developmental stage and virus titer. Also, the average titer in male insects was threefold higher than female titers, and this difference persisted up to 30 d post adult eclosion. Overall, our findings indicate that nymphs are more efficient than adults at acquiring MMV and virus accumulated in the vector {{over the course of}} nymphal development. Furthermore, sustained infection over the lifespan of P. maidis indicates a potentially high capacity of this vector to transmit MMV...|$|E
40|$|The <b>corn</b> <b>planthopper,</b> Peregrinus maidis, {{is a major}} pest of agronomically-important crops. Peregrinus maidis has a large {{geographical}} distribution and transmits Maize mosaic rhabdovirus (MMV) and Maize stripe tenuivirus (MSpV). The objective {{of this study was}} to develop effective RNAi methods for P. maidis. Vacuolar-ATPase (V-ATPase) is an essential enzyme for hydrolysis of ATP and for transport of protons out of cells thereby maintaining membrane ion balance, and it has been demonstrated to be an efficacious target for RNAi in other insects. In this study, two genes encoding subunits of P. maidis V-ATPase (V-ATPase B and V-ATPase D) were chosen as RNAi target genes. The open reading frames of V-ATPase B and D were generated and used for constructing dsRNA fragments. Experiments were conducted using oral delivery and microinjection of V-ATPase B and V-ATPase D dsRNA to investigate the effectiveness of RNAi in P. maidis. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis indicated that microinjection of V-ATPase dsRNA led to a minimum reduction of 27 -fold in the normalized abundance of V-ATPase transcripts two days post injection, while ingestion of dsRNA resulted in a two-fold reduction after six days of feeding. While both methods of dsRNA delivery resulted in knockdown of target transcripts, the injection method was more rapid and effective. The reduction in V-ATPase transcript abundance resulted in observable phenotypes. Specifically, the development of nymphs injected with 200 ng of either V-ATPase B or D dsRNA was impaired, resulting in higher mortality and lower fecundity than control insects injected with GFP dsRNA.
