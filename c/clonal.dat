5|$|In 1958 Gustav Nossal and Lederberg {{showed that}} one B cell always {{produces}} only one antibody, {{which was the}} first evidence for <b>clonal</b> selection theory. Burnet wrote further about the theory in his 1959 book The <b>Clonal</b> Selection Theory of Acquired Immunity. His theory predicted almost all of the key features of the immune system as we understand it today, including autoimmune disease, immune tolerance and somatic hypermutation as a mechanism in antibody production. The <b>clonal</b> selection theory became one of the central concepts of immunology, and Burnet regarded his contributions to the theoretical understanding of the immune system as his greatest contribution to science, writing that he and Jerne should have received the Nobel for this work. Jerne was recognised for his contributions to the conceptualisation of the immune system when he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1984.|$|E
5|$|The <b>clonal</b> {{selection}} {{theory was}} proved correct when Sir Gustav Nossal showed that each B cell always produces only one antibody.|$|E
5|$|A {{conflict}} between the sexes of a species is seen in some species of ants with these reproducers apparently competing to produce offspring that are as closely related to them as possible. The most extreme form involves the production of <b>clonal</b> offspring. An extreme of sexual conflict is seen in Wasmannia auropunctata, where the queens produce diploid daughters by thelytokous parthenogenesis and males produce clones by a process whereby a diploid egg loses its maternal contribution to produce haploid males who are clones of the father.|$|E
5|$|Durian was {{introduced}} into Australia {{in the early}} 1960s and <b>clonal</b> material was first introduced in 1975. Over thirty clones of D. zibethinus and six Durio species have been subsequently introduced into Australia. China is the major importer, purchasing 65,000 tonnes in 1999, followed by Singapore with 40,000 tonnes and Taiwan with 5,000 tonnes. In the same year, the United States imported 2,000 tonnes, mostly frozen, and the European Community imported 500 tonnes.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the general}} {{structure}} of all antibodies is very similar, a small region {{at the tip}} of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen-binding sites, to exist. This region is known as the hypervariable region. Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen. This enormous diversity of antibody paratopes on the antigen-binding fragments allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens. The large and diverse population of antibody paratope is generated by random recombination events of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen-binding sites (or paratopes), followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene, which create further diversity. This recombinational process that produces <b>clonal</b> antibody paratope diversity is called V(D)J or VJ recombination. Basically, the antibody paratope is polygenic, made up of three genes, V, D, and J. Each paratope locus is also polymorphic, such that during antibody production, one allele of V, one of D, and one of J is chosen. These gene segments are then joined together using random genetic recombination to produce the paratope. The regions where the genes are randomly recombined together is the hyper variable region used to recognise different antigens on a <b>clonal</b> basis.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{in higher}} animals, where {{parthenogenesis}} is rare, asexual reproduction may occur in plants by several different mechanisms. The formation of stem tubers in potato is one example. Particularly in arctic or alpine habitats, where opportunities for fertilisation of flowers by animals are rare, plantlets or bulbs, may develop instead of flowers, replacing sexual reproduction with asexual reproduction and {{giving rise to}} <b>clonal</b> populations genetically identical to the parent. This {{is one of several}} types of apomixis that occur in plants. Apomixis can also happen in a seed, producing a seed that contains an embryo genetically identical to the parent.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{mutations}} {{that change}} protein sequences are harmful or neutral, some mutations have benefits. These mutations may enable the mutant organism to withstand particular environmental stresses better than wild type organisms, or reproduce more quickly. In these cases a mutation {{will tend to}} become more common in a population through natural selection. Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material have rapid mutation rates, which can be an advantage, since these viruses thereby evolve rapidly, and thus evade the immune system defensive responses. In large populations of asexually reproducing organisms, for example, E. coli, multiple beneficial mutations may co-occur. This phenomenon is called <b>clonal</b> interference and causes competition among the mutations.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoans exhibit {{great powers}} of regeneration; lost parts swiftly regrow {{and the sea}} anemone Aiptasia pallida can be vivisected in the {{laboratory}} {{and then returned to}} the aquarium where it will heal. They are capable of a variety of asexual means of reproduction including fragmentation, longitudinal and transverse fission and budding. Sea anemones for example can crawl across a surface leaving behind them detached pieces of the pedal disc which develop into new <b>clonal</b> individuals. Anthopleura species divide longitudinally, pulling themselves apart, resulting in groups of individuals with identical colouring and patterning. Transverse fission is less common, but occurs in Anthopleura stellula and Gonactinia prolifera, with a rudimentary band of tentacles appearing on the column before the sea anemone tears itself apart. Zoanthids are capable of budding off new individuals.|$|E
5|$|At the {{prenatal}} and neonatal {{stages of}} life, {{the presence of}} antibodies is provided by passive immunization from the mother. Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of antibodies, and usually appear within {{the first years of}} life. Since antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream, they are said {{to be part of the}} humoral immune system. Circulating antibodies are produced by <b>clonal</b> B cells that specifically respond to only one antigen (an example is a virus capsid protein fragment). Antibodies contribute to immunity in three ways: They prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells by binding to them; they stimulate removal of pathogens by macrophages and other cells by coating the pathogen; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other immune responses such as the complement pathway. Antibodies will also trigger vasoactive amine degranulation to contribute to immunity against certain types of antigens (helminths, allergens).|$|E
5|$|EFS {{has mostly}} a repressive role of EFS on {{processes}} {{associated with the}} activation of mature T-cells, including IL-2 pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and IL-2-dependent <b>clonal</b> expansion of T cells. Upon T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, EFS dephosphorylation and release of the SRC family kinase FYN and phospholipase C-Î³ normally lead to self-limitation of the immune response. Consistent with this mechanism, EFS overexpression in T cell-derived cell lines decreased IL-2 concentration in supernatants in response to TCR stimulation, while T cells derived from mice lacking EFS gene showed increased IL-2 production. A dual role of EFS in mature T cells function has been proposed because both overexpression and siRNA knockdown of this protein in cell models resulted in decreased transcriptional activation of IL-2 dependent promoters following TCR stimulation.|$|E
5|$|Fungal mycelia {{can become}} {{visible to the}} naked eye, for example, on various {{surfaces}} and substrates, such as damp walls and spoiled food, where they are commonly called molds. Mycelia grown on solid agar media in laboratory petri dishes are usually referred to as colonies. These colonies can exhibit growth shapes and colors (due to spores or pigmentation) that can be used as diagnostic features in the identification of species or groups. Some individual fungal colonies can reach extraordinary dimensions and ages {{as in the case of}} a <b>clonal</b> colony of Armillaria solidipes, which extends over an area of more than 900ha (3.5 square miles), with an estimated age of nearly 9,000years.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to ripeness levels, the harvest yields {{can also have}} a strong influence in the resulting quality and flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon wine. The vine itself is prone to vigorous yields, particularly when planted on the vigorous SO4 rootstock. Excessive yields can result in less concentrated and flavorful wine with flavors more on the green or herbaceous side. In the 1970s, a particular clone of Cabernet Sauvignon that was engineered to be virus free was noted for its very high yields-causing many quality conscious producers to replant their vineyards in the late 20th century with different <b>clonal</b> varieties. To reduce yields, producers can plant the vines on less vigorous rootstock and also practice green harvesting with aggressive pruning of grape clusters soon after veraison.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones {{have great}} powers of {{regeneration}} and can reproduce asexually, by budding, fragmentation, or by longitudinal or transverse binary fission. Some {{species such as}} certain Anthopleura divide longitudinally, pulling themselves apart, resulting in groups of individuals with identical colouring and markings. Transverse fission is less common, but occurs in Anthopleura stellula and Gonactinia prolifera, with a rudimentary band of tentacles appearing halfway up the column before it splits horizontally. Some species can also reproduce by pedal laceration. In this process, a ring of material may break off from the pedal disc {{at the base of}} the column which then fragments, the pieces regenerating into new <b>clonal</b> individuals. Alternatively, fragments detach separately as the animal creeps across a surface. In Metridium dianthus, fragmentation rates were higher in individuals living among live mussels than among dead shells, and all the new individuals had tentacles within three weeks.|$|E
25|$|Many trees, shrubs, vines, {{ferns and}} other {{herbaceous}} perennials form <b>clonal</b> colonies naturally. Parts {{of an individual}} plant may become detached by fragmentation and grow on to become separate <b>clonal</b> individuals. A common example is in the vegetative reproduction of moss and liverwort gametophyte clones by means of gemmae. Some vascular plants e.g. dandelion and certain viviparous grasses also form seeds asexually, termed apomixis, resulting in <b>clonal</b> populations of genetically identical individuals.|$|E
25|$|In the asexual fission {{phase of}} growth, during which cell {{divisions}} occur by mitosis rather than meiosis, <b>clonal</b> aging occurs {{leading to a}} gradual loss of vitality. In some species, such as the well studied Paramecium tetraurelia, the asexual line of clonally aging paramecia loses vitality and expires after about 200 fissions if the cells fail to undergo meiosis followed by either autogamy (self-fertilizaion) or conjugation (outcrossing) (see aging in Paramecium). DNA damage increases dramatically during successive <b>clonal</b> cell divisions and is a likely cause of <b>clonal</b> aging in P. tetraurelia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonal</b> eosinophilias {{are caused}} by {{acquired}} genetic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells that leads to, or are associated with, a form of chronic eosinophilic leukemia or various forms of myeloid neoplasms, lymphoid neoplasms, myelofibrosis, or the myelodysplastic syndrome. The latter forms of <b>clonal</b> eosinophilia are commonly associated with blood or tissue eosinophilia.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1960s, more {{focus has}} been placed on the choice of {{rootstocks}} and <b>clonal</b> selection, with six approved clones of Gamay for the wine region. In recent years the rootstock Vialla has gained popularity due to its propensity to produce well in granite soils. The SO4 and 3309 rootstocks also account for significant plantings. <b>Clonal</b> selection of the Gamay grape has shifted towards an emphasis on smaller, thicker-skinned berries.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance is also {{produced}} in T cells. There are also various processes {{which lead to}} B cell tolerance. Just as in T cells, <b>clonal</b> deletion and <b>clonal</b> anergy can physically eliminate autoreactive B cell clones. Receptor editing is another mechanism for B cell tolerance. This involves the reactivation or maintenance of V(D)J recombination in the cell {{which leads to the}} expression of novel receptor specificity through V region gene rearrangements which will create variation in the heavy and light immunoglobulin (Ig) chains.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonal</b> Anergy theory, {{proposed}} by Nossal, in which self-reactive T- or B-cells become inactivated {{in the normal}} individual and cannot amplify the immune response.|$|E
25|$|A related phenomenon, {{polyembryony}} is {{a process}} that produces multiple <b>clonal</b> offspring from a single egg cell. This is known in some hymenopteran parasitoids and in Strepsiptera.|$|E
25|$|This process continues, so {{that each}} {{generation}} is half (or hemi-) <b>clonal</b> on the mother's side and has half new genetic material from the father's side.|$|E
25|$|Thalidomide and its analogs {{help with}} the co-stimulation of T-cells through the B7-CD28 complex by phosphorylating {{tyrosine}} on the CD28 receptor. In vitro data suggests this co-stimulation leads to increased Th1 type cytokine release of IFN-Î³ and IL-2 that further stimulates <b>clonal</b> T cell proliferation and natural killer cell proliferation and activity. This enhances natural and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Lenalidomide and pomalidomide are about 100-1000 times more potent in stimulating T-cell <b>clonal</b> proliferation than thalidomide. In addition, in vitro data suggests pomalidomide reverts Th2 cells into Th1 by enhancing transcription factor T-bet.|$|E
25|$|It {{is tempting}} to define {{neoplasms}} as <b>clonal</b> cellular proliferations but the demonstration of clonality is not always possible. Therefore, clonality is not required {{in the definition of}} neoplasia.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, he was {{the first}} to plant a Malbec {{vineyard}} at almost 1500m (5,000 feet) elevation in the Gualtallary sub-district of Tupungato, the Adrianna Vineyard, and to develop a <b>clonal</b> selection of Argentine Malbec.|$|E
25|$|A {{theoretical}} framework explaining {{the workings of}} the adaptive immune system is provided by immune network theory. This theory, which builds on established concepts of <b>clonal</b> selection, is being applied in the search for an HIV vaccine.|$|E
25|$|Barbera {{can adapt}} {{to a wide range}} of {{vineyard}} soils but tends to thrive most in less fertile calcareous soils and clay loam. Sandy soils can help limit the vigor and yields. The grape rarely thrives in very alkaline or saline soils. Like many grape varieties with a long history, the Barbera vine has seen mutation and <b>clonal</b> variation arise with different clones of the variety found in Piedmont, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and the Mezzogiorno. The different clones can be identified by the size and shape of their grape clusters with the smaller cluster clones producing the highest quality wine. In recent years, viticulturalists have been working with <b>clonal</b> selection to increase Barbera's resistance to the leafroll virus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonal</b> species {{like the}} New Zealand mudsnail can often develop <b>clonal</b> lines with quite diverse appearances, called morphs. Until 2005, all the snails {{found in the}} western states of the U.S. were {{believed}} to be from a single line. However a second morph has been identified in Idaho's Snake River. It grows to a similar size but has a distinctive appearance. (It has been nicknamed the salt-and-pepper mudsnail due to the final whorl being lighter {{than the rest of the}} shell.) This morph has apparently been present in the area for several years before being identified correctly as a distinct morph of Potamopyrgus antipodarum. It dominates the typical morph where they overlap, and has a much higher prevalence of males.|$|E
25|$|Early {{results in}} the late 20th century, were not very {{promising}} for California winemakers. Poor site and <b>clonal</b> selection had the grape planted in vineyards that gave it too much exposure to the sun, producing wines that had {{little in common with}} the wines of Tuscany. The Antinori family, which once owned Atlas Peak Vineyards located in the Atlas Peak AVA in the foothills of Napa Valley found that the greater intensity of sunlight in California may have been one possible factor for the poorer quality. Today the style of these Californian Sangiovese tend to be more fruit-driven than their Tuscan counterparts with some floral notes. Recent years have focused on improving vineyard site and <b>clonal</b> selection as well as giving the vines time to age and develop in quality.|$|E
25|$|Avocados can be {{propagated}} by seed, taking roughly four to {{six years}} to bear fruit, although in some cases seedlings can take 10 years to come into bearing. The offspring {{is unlikely to be}} identical to the parent cultivar in fruit quality. Prime quality varieties are therefore propagated by grafting to rootstocks that are propagated by seed (seedling rootstocks) or by layering (<b>clonal</b> rootstocks). After about a year of growing in a greenhouse, the young rootstocks are ready to be grafted. Terminal and lateral grafting is normally used. The scion cultivar grows for another 6â12 months before the tree is ready to be sold. <b>Clonal</b> rootstocks are selected for tolerance of specific soil and disease conditions, such as poor soil aeration or resistance to the soil-borne disease (root rot) caused by Phytophthora.|$|E
25|$|Tasmania {{is home to}} some of {{the oldest}} trees of the world. For example, some {{individual}} Huon pines are recorded as more than 2,000years old. A <b>clonal</b> stand of male Huon pines at Mount Read maintained itself by vegetative reproduction for an estimated more than 10,000years.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonal</b> Ignorance theory, {{according}} to which autoreactive T cells that are not represented in the thymus will mature and migrate to the periphery, where they will not encounter the appropriate antigen because it is inaccessible tissues. Consequently, auto-reactive B cells, that escape deletion, cannot find the antigen or the specific helper T cell.|$|E
25|$|Sporophytes {{are fairly}} {{tolerant}} of drought, but require well-drained soils. The prothallia (gametophytes) of A.platyneuron can survive periods of drought {{for up to}} a month. There is some evidence to show that the prothallia may undergo <b>clonal</b> reproduction and fission, which has been induced in the laboratory through variations in light intensity.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there is}} only a limited {{repertoire}} of antigen that B cells can encounter within the thymus. B cell tolerance then must occur within the periphery after the induction of B cell tolerance within the thymus as a more diverse group of antigens can be encountered in peripheral tissues. This same positive and negative selection mechanism, but in peripheral tissues, is known as <b>clonal</b> anergy. The mechanism of <b>clonal</b> anergy is important to maintain tolerance to many autologous antigens. Active suppression is the other known mechanism of T cell tolerance. Active suppression involves the injection of large amounts of foreign antigen {{in the absence of an}} adjuvant which leads to a state of unresponsiveness. This unresponsive state is then transferred to a naÃ¯ve recipient from the injected donor to induce a state of tolerance within the recipient.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonal</b> T-cell {{expansion}} in RCD2 is not manageable with steroids (see: RCD 1) and sometimes manageable with chemotherapeutic drugs, however, more aggressive therapies seem more affective. A {{high percentage of}} RCD 2 patients spontaneously develop lymphoma (EATL), the 5 year survival rate is markedly lower than RCD1 but higher than lymphoma. DQ2.5/DQ2 individuals are more frequently found.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s and 2000s, the {{emphasis}} of Red Willow has been on exploring new <b>clonal</b> selections and matching clones to terroir. Many {{of the most recent}} plantings have been newer clones of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah as well as dividing existing plantings of the vineyards into smaller blocks that reflect the same growing and ripening conditions.|$|E
25|$|Secondary or {{peripheral}} lymphoid organs, {{which include}} lymph nodes and the spleen, maintain mature naive lymphocytes and initiate an adaptive immune response. The peripheral lymphoid organs are {{the sites of}} lymphocyte activation by antigens. Activation leads to <b>clonal</b> expansion and affinity maturation. Mature lymphocytes recirculate between the blood and the peripheral lymphoid organs until they encounter their specific antigen.|$|E
