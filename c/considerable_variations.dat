5|$|As of October 2010, {{there are}} four rest areas {{operating}} along the A6 motorway, as a new rest area opened on October 9, 2010 next to the western portal of Tuhobić Tunnel on the VrataOštrovica section of the route. Applicable legislation provides for four types of rest areas designated as types A through D: A-type rest areas comprise {{a full range of}} amenities including a filling station, a restaurant and a hotel or a motel; B-type rest areas have no lodging; C-type rest areas are very common and include a filling station and a café, but no restaurants or accommodations; and D-type rest areas offer parking spaces only, with possibly some picnic tables, benches, and restrooms. Even though the rest areas found along the A6 motorway generally follow this ranking system, there are <b>considerable</b> <b>variations,</b> as some of them offer extra services. The most notable example is Lepenica rest areaeven though it has no restaurant and therefore falls below B-type rest area standard, there is, for instance, an RV park available. The filling stations typically have small convenience stores and some of them offer LPG fuel. As of October 2010, all of the rest areas found along the A6 motorway comply with C-type rest area standards or above.|$|E

5|$|As of September 2010, {{there are}} 26 rest areas {{operating}} along the A1 motorway, and additional rest areas are planned along the existing {{sections of the}} route and those sections under construction. Legislation provides for four types of rest areas designated as types A through D—A-type rest areas comprise {{a full range of}} amenities including a filling station, a restaurant and a hotel or a motel; B-type rest areas have no lodging; C-type rest areas are very common and include a filling station and a café, but no restaurants or accommodation; D-type rest areas offer parking spaces only, possibly some picnicking tables and benches and restrooms. Even though the rest areas found along the A1 motorway generally follow this ranking system, there are <b>considerable</b> <b>variations</b> as some of them offer extra services. The most notable example is Krka rest area—even though it has no filling station, there is, for instance, a restaurant available. The filling stations regularly have small convenience stores and some of them offer LPG fuel. EuroTest, an international association of 18 European automobile clubs spearheaded by German automobile club ADAC, surveyed three of the A1 motorway rest areas in 2009: Krka, Lički Osik and Modruš (in case of the latter, both eastbound and westbound). All of the rest areas were rated as very good, especially in terms of facilities offered.|$|E
5|$|Odes {{were first}} {{developed}} by poets writing in ancient Greek, such as Pindar, and Latin, such as Horace. Forms of odes appear {{in many of}} the cultures that were influenced by the Greeks and Latins. The ode generally has three parts: a strophe, an antistrophe, and an epode. The antistrophes of the ode possess similar metrical structures and, depending on the tradition, similar rhyme structures. In contrast, the epode is written with a different scheme and structure. Odes have a formal poetic diction, and generally deal with a serious subject. The strophe and antistrophe look at the subject from different, often conflicting, perspectives, with the epode moving to a higher level to either view or resolve the underlying issues. Odes are often intended to be recited or sung by two choruses (or individuals), with the first reciting the strophe, the second the antistrophe, and both together the epode. Over time, differing forms for odes have developed with <b>considerable</b> <b>variations</b> in form and structure, but generally showing the original influence of the Pindaric or Horatian ode. One non-Western form which resembles the ode is the qasida in Persian poetry.|$|E
25|$|There are <b>considerable</b> <b>variations</b> between {{countries}} {{in their approach}} to sexual violence. Some countries have far-reaching legislation and legal procedures, with a broad definition of rape that includes marital rape, and with heavy penalties for those convicted and a strong response in supporting victims. Commitment to preventing or controlling sexual violence is also reflected in an emphasis on police training and an appropriate allocation of police resources to the problem, in the priority given to investigating cases of sexual assault, and in the resources made available to support victims and provide medico-legal services.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{the track}} gauge has had <b>considerable</b> <b>variations,</b> with narrow gauge common in many early systems. However, most light rail systems are now {{standard}} gauge. Older standard-gauge vehicles could not negotiate sharp turns {{as easily as}} narrow-gauge ones, but modern light rail systems achieve tighter turning radii by using articulated cars. An important advantage of standard gauge is that standard railway maintenance equipment {{can be used on}} it, rather than custom-built machinery. Using standard gauge also allows light rail vehicles to be moved around, conveniently using the same tracks as freight railways. Another factor favoring standard gauge is that accessibility laws are making low-floor trams mandatory, and there is generally insufficient space for wheelchairs to move between the wheels in a narrow-gauge layout. Furthermore, standard-gauge rolling stock can be switched between networks either temporarily or permanently and both newly built and used standard-gauge rolling stock tends to be cheaper to buy, as more companies offer such vehicles.|$|E

By 1998, modern technology had made available [...] "videos, audio cassette, a CD-ROMs, a computer program, and Internet sites", as described by Margaret Mackey writing in The case of Peter Rabbit: changing conditions of literature for children. She continues: [...] "Warne and their collaborators and competitors have produced a large collection of activity books and a monthly educational magazine". A plethora of other Peter Rabbit related merchandise exists, and [...] "toy shops in the United States and Britain have whole sections of [...] store specially signposted and earmarked exclusively for Potter-related toys and merchandise".|$|E
500|$|The least weasel has a {{very wide}} circumboreal range and a large total {{population}} and is therefore listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of [...] "least concern". Its chosen habitat is in areas of coarse vegetation and in some regions its numbers may be decreasing because of changes in agricultural practices, but altogether its population trend {{is thought to be}} steady. It is relatively common in Eurasia but less abundant in North America and is thought to be rare in the southeastern United States. It is subject to <b>considerable</b> <b>variations</b> in numbers in areas where its main rodent prey is liable to large population fluctuations. In years of rodent population booms, the least weasel numbers may rise by up to ten-fold, only to slump again as prey becomes scarce again in the following years.|$|E
500|$|<b>Considerable</b> <b>variations</b> {{exist in}} the pisco used in the cocktails. According to food and wine expert Mark Spivak, the {{difference}} is in the way both beverages are produced; whereas [...] "Chilean pisco is mass-produced", the Peruvian version [...] "is made in small batches." [...] Cocktail historian Andrew Bohrer focuses his comparison on taste, claiming that [...] "n Peru, pisco is made in a pot still, distilled to proof, and un-aged; it {{is very similar to}} grappa. In Chile, pisco is made in a column still and aged in wood; it is similar to a very light cognac." [...] Chilean oenologist Patricio Tapia adds that while Chilean pisco producers usually mix vine stocks, Peruvian producers have specific pisco types that use the aromatic qualities of vines such as Yellow Muscat and Italia. Tapia concludes this is why Peruvian pisco bottles denote their vintage year and the Chilean versions do not.|$|E

In old Filipino orthography, the letter was also used, along with g, to represent the velar nasal sound [...] (except {{at the end of}} a word, when ng would be used) if appropriate instead of a tilde, which originally spanned a sequence of n and g (as in n͠g), such as pan͠galan ("name"). That is because the old orthography was based on Spanish, and without the tilde, pangalan would have been pronounced with the sequence [...] (therefore pang-GAlan). The form ñg became a more common way to represent n͠g until the early 20th century, mainly because it was more readily available in typesets than the tilde spanning both letters.|$|E
2500|$|Straight edge (sometimes {{abbreviated}} sXe or {{signified by}} XXX or X) is a subculture of hardcore punk whose adherents refrain from using alcohol, tobacco and other recreational drugs, {{in reaction to}} the excesses of punk subculture. For some, this extends to refraining from engaging in promiscuous sex, following a vegetarian or vegan diet or not using caffeine or prescription drugs. The term straight edge was adopted from the 1981 song [...] "Straight Edge" [...] by the hardcore punk band Minor Threat. Ross Haenfler writes that as of the late 1990s, approximately three out of four straight edge participants were vegetarian or vegan. While the commonly expressed aspects of the straight edge subculture have been abstinence from alcohol, nicotine, and illegal drugs, there have been <b>considerable</b> <b>variations</b> on how far to take the interpretations of [...] "abstaining from intoxicants" [...] or [...] "living drug-free". Disagreements often arise as to the primary reasons for living straight edge. Straight edge politics are primarily left-wing and revolutionary but there have been conservative offshoots.|$|E
