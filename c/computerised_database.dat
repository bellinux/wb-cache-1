It is important to assess the efficacy of psychological interventions in older adults because extant research indicates that treating depression with medication becomes complicated in later life.

Mindful of the criticisms of the recent investigation into the Yorkshire Ripper, which had become overwhelmed due to the volume of information filed in a card filing system, one of Clark's first decisions upon taking overall charge of the murder investigation was to introduce computer technology into the investigation; he and other senior officers agreed that {{the most efficient way}} to cooperate in an investigation of this scope was to collate their information on the Hogg murder into a <b>computerised</b> <b>database,</b> which all forces involved in the manhunt could access. Information relating to Maxwell's murder was also later entered onto this database.|$|E

50|$|According to K H Rogers book, Vikings and Surnames, {{in which}} he {{discusses}} the origins of surnames, there is a brief reference to Whincup being derived from an early place name Whincop, the name being of Cumberland origin, but {{more research is needed}} on this. The Domesday Book has been checked for any reference to a medieval Whincop hamlet, village, settlement or field name, but Cumberland is not well covered. Many hamlets will not have survived the centuries and if Whincop was a field name it may not even be documented. Or it may derive more from a topographical feature rather than a named place. In old English the word “hop” is a type of valley. Little work has been done on the Whincup study of place names. This is worthy of more research and there is plenty of literature about. There is an “English Place Name Society”, and some very good reference works and place-name dictionaries. In one reference book there is mention of a <b>computerised</b> <b>database</b> of place-name material being compiled at Nottingham University. A current Ordnance Survey map of Cumberland, shows a hamlet/farmstead named Whincop. Research in local libraries and the record office did not produce any further information.

40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the possibilities for}} extending the CSCW approach to searching and browsing in <b>computerised</b> <b>databases.</b> In particular we are concerned with supporting the learning of browsing techniques. In the Higher Education sector the most visible data resource {{is that of the}} university library; most of which have computerised their stocks with online public access catalogues (OPACs). This resource is supplemented by the provision of databases on CD-ROM of books and journal articles. Increasingly, both the student and the researcher are including remote libraries and databases amongst their data sources [Sack, 1986]. The relentless growth of the Internet and the success of browsers such as Mosaic only add to the enormous variety and number of resources available. The computerised library (or other similar database) is already an integral part of undergraduate courses and the skills to effectively access and utilise can be expected to become increasingly valued, both in academic and commercial environments [Jackson, 1989]. We can expect that in the near future, the ability to effectively browse databases {{will be one of the}} transferable skills expected by employers of all graduates regardless of their course of study. This report takes the OPAC as a context for examining the issues involved in supporting collaborative activities in <b>computerised</b> <b>databases.</b> In addition to conventional searching/browsing behaviour, new types of activity become possible which are not feasible in physical libraries [Rice, 1988]. The report includes a literature review on searching and browsing, an exploratory study of collaborative browsing and a discussion of the mechanisms needed to support collaborative activities in databases. Also discussed are methods to aid the teaching of datab [...] ...|$|R

Documentation of the clinical services provided is an important procedure in recognition of this role.

No United Kingdom based studies were found. Interventions that encourage walking and do not require attendance at a facility are most likely to lead to sustainable increases in overall physical activity. Brisk walking has the greatest potential for increasing overall activity levels of a sedentary population and meeting current public health recommendations.
