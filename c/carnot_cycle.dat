50|$|In his ideal model, {{the heat}} of caloric {{converted}} into work could be reinstated by reversing {{the motion of the}} cycle, a concept subsequently known as thermodynamic reversibility.

25|$|The Carnot {{heat-engine}} cycle described is {{a totally}} reversible cycle. That is, all the processes that comprise it can be reversed, in which case it becomes the Carnot refrigeration cycle. This time, the cycle remains exactly the same except that the directions of any heat and work interactions are reversed. Heat is absorbed from the low-temperature reservoir, heat is rejected to a high-temperature reservoir, and a work input is required to accomplish all this.

This can help illustrate, for example, why a reheater or a regenerator can improve the thermal efficiency of steam power plants—and why the thermal efficiency of combined-cycle power plants (which incorporate gas turbines operating at even higher temperatures) exceeds that of conventional steam plants.

25|$|The <b>Carnot</b> <b>cycle</b> is a {{theoretical}} thermodynamic cycle proposed by French physicist Sadi Carnot in 1824 and expanded upon by {{others in the}} 1830s and 1840s. It provides an upper limit on the efficiency that any classical thermodynamic engine can achieve during the conversion of heat into work, or conversely, the efficiency of a refrigeration system in creating a temperature difference (e.g. refrigeration) by the application of work to the system. It is not an actual thermodynamic cycle but is {{a theoretical}} construct.|$|E
25|$|To summarize, the Stirling engine {{uses the}} {{temperature}} difference between its hot end and cold end {{to establish a}} cycle of a fixed mass of gas, heated and expanded, and cooled and compressed, thus converting thermal energy into mechanical energy. The greater the temperature difference between the hot and cold sources, the greater the thermal efficiency.

25|$|Actual {{measurements}} on the 50kW Manzanares pilot {{solar updraft tower}} found a conversion efficiency of 0.53%, although SBP believe {{that this could be}} increased to 1.3% in a large and improved 100MW unit.

The usage of water as a working-medium dramatically increases the potential for thermal energy capture, and electrical generation, due to its specific heat capacity. While the design may have its problems (see next section) and the stated efficiency claims has yet to be demonstrated, it would be an error to extrapolate performance from one to the other simply because of similarities in the name.|$|E

This principle is independent of models, statistical mechanical or otherwise, and can be understood without recourse to <b>Carnot</b> <b>cycles,</b> ideal gases and other assumptions about such things as `heat', `temperature', `reversible processes', etc., as is usually done.

New formulas for the specific enthalpies are presented. Cyclic processes are discussed in detail, e. g. the Brayton, Ericsson and <b>Carnot</b> <b>cycles.</b> Magnetic refrigeration and magnetic heat pump cycles are preferably designed by applying the cascade or/and regeneration principle.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, exergy {{destruction}} minimization {{has been}} carried out for an irreversible <b>Carnot</b> refrigeration <b>cycle.</b> The rates of destroyed exergy in various portion of this physical model are derived. The goal of exergy destruction minimization is to minimize the rate of total destroyed exergy of the system. By defining the recovery factor during power input process and introducing an irreversibility coefficient of the system, the optimum cycle temperatures in the isothermal cooling process and the isothermal heating process are obtained. The optimum values of cycle cooling rate, coefficient of performance of the system, and total destroyed exergy rate are derived simultaneously. The influences of various parameters on these optimum values are studied by numerical calculation. The results show that the exergy destructionminimization method is important and effective for the design of an irreversible <b>Carnot</b> refrigeration <b>cycle...</b>|$|R
25|$|It {{is framed}} {{in terms of}} an {{idealized}} device called a Carnot engine, imagined to define a continuous cycle of states of its working body. The cycle is imagined to run so slowly that at each point of the cycle the working body {{is in a state of}} thermodynamic equilibrium. There are four limbs in such a <b>Carnot</b> <b>cycle.</b> The engine consists of four bodies. The main one is called the working body. Two of them are called heat reservoirs, so large that their respective non-deformation variables are not changed by transfer of energy as heat through a wall permeable only to heat to the working body. The fourth body is able to exchange energy with the working body only through adiabatic work; it may be called the work reservoir. The substances and states of the two heat reservoirs should be chosen so that they are not in thermal equilibrium with one another. This means that they must be at different fixed temperatures, one, labeled here with the number 1, hotter than the other, labeled here with the number 2. This can be tested by connecting the heat reservoirs successively to an auxiliary empirical thermometric body that starts each time at a convenient fixed intermediate temperature. The thermometric body should be composed of a material that has a strictly monotonic relation between its chosen empirical thermometric variable and the amount of adiabatic isochoric work done on it. In order to settle the structure and sense of operation of the <b>Carnot</b> <b>cycle,</b> it is convenient to use such a material also for the working body; because most materials are of this kind, this is hardly a restriction of the generality of this definition. The <b>Carnot</b> <b>cycle</b> is considered to start from an initial condition of the working body that was reached by the completion of a reversible adiabatic compression. From there, the working body is initially connected by a wall permeable only to heat to the heat reservoir number 1, so that during the first limb of the cycle it expands and does work on the work reservoir. The second limb of the cycle sees the working body expand adiabatically and reversibly, with no energy exchanged as heat, but more energy being transferred as work to the work reservoir. The third limb of the cycle sees the working body connected, through a wall permeable only to heat, to the heat reservoir 2, contracting and accepting energy as work from the work reservoir. The cycle is closed by reversible adiabatic compression of the working body, with no energy transferred as heat, but energy being transferred to it as work from the work reservoir.|$|E
25|$|As {{the cycle}} {{named after him}} doesn't waste caloric, the {{reversible}} engine has to use this cycle. Imagine now two large bodies, a hot and a cold one. He postulates now {{the existence of a}} heat machine with a greater efficiency. We couple now two idealized machine but of different efficiencies and connect them to the same hot and the same cold body. The first and less efficient one lets a constant amount of entropy ∆S = Q/T flow from hot to cold during each cycle, yielding an amount of work denoted W. If we use now this work to power the other more efficient machine, it would, using the amount of work W gained during each cycle by the first machine, make an amount of entropy ∆S' > ∆S flow from the cold to the hot body. The net effect is a flow of ∆S' − ∆S ≠ 0 of entropy from the cold to the hot body, while no net work is done. Consequently, the cold body is cooled down and the hot body rises in temperature. As the difference of temperature rises now the yielding of work by the first is greater in the successive cycles and due to the second engine difference in temperature of the two bodies stretches by each cycle evan more. In the end this set of machines would be a perpetuum mobile that cannot exist. This proves that the assumption of the existence of a more efficient engine was wrong so that an heat engine that operates the <b>Carnot</b> <b>cycle</b> must be the most efficient one. This means that a frictionless heat engine that lacks of conductive heat flow driven by a difference of temperature shows maximum possible efficiency.|$|E
