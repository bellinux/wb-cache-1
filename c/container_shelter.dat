Authorities had earlier cleared tents and shacks from this area and erected 125 metal shipping containers in their place, converting the <b>containers</b> into <b>shelters</b> for up to 1,500 migrants. Shipping containers, rather than more permanent structures, were chosen because the sand dunes are unfit for permanent foundations. The <b>container</b> <b>shelters</b> were painted white and were furnished with bunk beds, windows, and heaters, but no running water or sanitary facilities (toilets and showers were made available at an existing nearby facility).

40|$|Purpose - This paper aims {{to analyse}} the factors {{influencing}} refurbishment site managers' waste management efforts. Design/methodology/approach - Twenty-seven semi-structured interviews were held with managers from two large contractors involved in housing and office refurbishment projects in Sweden. Also, a web and postal questionnaire survey {{was sent to}} 232 refurbishment site managers and received a 34 per cent response rate. Findings - Site managers devise waste management strategies based on environmental inventories and project size. In smaller projects, waste contractors are employed only for physical activities rather than providing advice. Site managers' waste management efforts are influenced by project-related factors, organizational and personal factors, technical factors, industry culture and legislation. The level of contract detail, specific client demands related to waste management and project size are important factors. Practical implications - Policies and guidelines for projects of different sizes should be developed at least for large contractors; scale influences site managers' waste strategies. Waste management efforts in refurbishment projects can be improved by addressing simple technical problems including providing clear labelling of <b>containers</b> and ensuring <b>shelter</b> fromrain and snow. Originality/value - This is a pioneer survey of refurbishment site manager opinions and practices. Inefficient waste management in building refurbishment projects can be costly and harmful to the environment. There are many opportunities to improve waste management efforts...|$|R

Communication means will be integrated into the container to provide world-wide communication via voice, data transmission and fax. Standard telephone lines (ISDN) areused where available. Cellular phone (GSM, D-net) is used where digital telephone lines are not available at the position of the container. Inmarsat B high speed satellite communication is used wherever infrastructure is poor and other means of communication are not available.

30|$|The {{terminology}} {{applied to}} define current mass accommodation for refugees in Europe reveals some conceptual slippage. After the Second World War, this accommodation in Europe was commonly termed refugee camps. Even {{with the introduction}} of accommodation into the legal asylum frameworks of some European states in the 1980 s, it was initially referred to as camps. With the institutionalization of accommodation as part of asylum laws, legal and administrative terms such as (reception and accommodation) centers, (asylum) shelters, and homes have emerged. By signing up to the 1951 Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights–as well as due to EU directives–EU member states have been obliged to introduce regulations and provisions governing standards of living into their legal frameworks. In studies on institutionalized collective accommodation in and around European cities, researchers thus often refer to “European Accommodation Centres for Asylum Seekers” (Szczepanikova, 2013), “camp-like collective accommodations” (Pieper, 2008), and “asylum centres” (Morville & Erlandsson, 2013). The term “refugee camp” is mostly used to refer to first, camps in the global south, second, discourses on informal encampments, makeshift camps, and tent cities for transiting refugees (such as Calais in France and Idomeni in Greece), and third, hotspots, and detention and transit centers in border areas. This distinction is made to highlight differences in socio-spatial structures, living conditions, the accommodation’s nature, and questions of institutional responsibilities, governing, and labeling spaces and people. In these contexts, camps are referenced as large spaces with an insecure, temporary, or exceptional legal status (for example regarding construction laws), which accommodate masses of people, have low standards of living, and consist of tents, <b>containers,</b> and/or improvised <b>shelters.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the response of}} spring wheat and oilseed rape to nitrogen (N) supply, focusing on the critical period for grain number definition and grain filling. Crops were grown in <b>containers</b> under a <b>shelter</b> and treated with five combinations of applied N. Wheat and oilseed rape produced comparable amounts of biomass and yield when corrected for the costs of biomass synthesis (SC). From the responses of biomass and yield to late N applications and the apparent contribution of mobilised biomass to yield, {{it seems that the}} yield of oilseed rape was more source-limited during grain filling than that of wheat, particularly at the medium and high N levels. Both species recovered equal amounts of N from the total available N in the soil and had similar N use efficiencies, expressed as yield per unit of N absorbed. However, oilseed rape had higher efficiency to convert absorbed N in biomass, but lower harvest index of N than wheat. Oilseed rape had similar or lower root biomass than wheat, depending on N level, but higher root length per unit soil volume and specific root length. The specific uptake rate of N per unit root dry weight during the critical period for grain number determination was higher in oilseed rape than in wheat. In wheat, N limitation affected growth through a similar or lower reduction in radiation use efficiency corrected for synthesis costs (RUESC) than in the cumulative amount of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (IPARc). In oilseed rape, lower growth due to N shortage was associated more with RUESC than IPARc, during flowering while during grain filling both components contributed similarly to decreased growth. RUESC and the concentration of N in leaves and inflorescence (LIN€decreased from flowering to maturity and were curvilinearly related. Oilseed rape tended to have higher RUESC than wheat at high N supply during the critical period for grain number determination, and generally lower during grain filling. The reasons for these differences and possibilities to increase yield potential are discussed in terms of the photosynthetic efficiency of the different organs and changes in source–sink ratio during reproductive stages...|$|R

Added to that are the man-made disasters; millions of displaced humans, wars and human aggression and acts of terrorism with incalculable damage to human life and property.

The study covers a broad survey of all the different kinds of emergency shelters available and the ones that had been used in the past based on the kind of material used, structure, cost, and durability, ease of construction, size and transportability. The survey resulted in a matrix that charts out these different shelters with their characteristics.; An in-depth detailed case study is performed on two prefab modular emergency shelters, one made from structurally insulated panels and the other from a shipping <b>container.</b> These two <b>shelters</b> are investigated for their environmental performance in three different Californian climate zones and the structurally insulated panel prefab system is assessed for its structural performance using specialized software tools. The environmental analysis is carried out using the simulation program Energy Plus (Design Builder). The climatic data for all the zones is resourced from a climate tool called Climate Consultant. The environmental results are compared on the basis of indoor air temperatures simulated and the overall energy consumption of the shelter. The overall study is aimed to show that these prefab modular shelters can be a good solution for a transitional emergency shelter and can play a significant part in solving the problem of lack of decent emergency shelter in developed nations. The structural analysis software tool SAP 2000 is used to model the prefab panel system and its structure is tested for the whole of California. The main aim is to check the seismic capabilities of the structure since seismic demand is higher than wind loading for short buildings in California or other seismic regions where earthquake disasters may occur...|$|R
