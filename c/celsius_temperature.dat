500|$|When, in 1948 the CGPM {{was charged}} with {{producing}} a coherent system of units of measure, definitions relating to temperature had to be clarified. At the 9th CGPM, the centigrade temperature scale was renamed the <b>Celsius</b> <b>temperature</b> scale and the scale itself was fixed by defining the triple point of water as 0.01°C, though the CGPM left the formal definition of absolute zero until the 10th CGPM when the name [...] "Kelvin" [...] {{was assigned to the}} absolute temperature scale and triple point of water was defined as being 273.16°K. In 1967, at the 13th CGPM the degree Kelvin (°K) was renamed the [...] "kelvin" [...] (K).|$|E
