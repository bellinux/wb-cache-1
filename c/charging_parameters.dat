Since in such strong gravity regime the dynamics of gravity should be modified from the one, its effect should be imprinted on the continuum spectrum originating from the black hole accretion. To explore the effects of these alternative theories on the black hole continuum spectrum in an explicit manner, we have discussed three alternative gravitational models having their origin in three distinct paradigms [...] - (a) higher dimensions, (b) higher curvature gravity and (c) Horndeski theories. All of them can have signatures sculptured on the black hole continuum spectrum, distinct from the standard general relativistic scenario.

40|$|A triode corona {{charging}} system was developed with controlled <b>charging</b> <b>parameters.</b> Typically, the surface voltage of electrified film {{is close to}} the grid voltage. To achieve a large uniformly charged area, relatively large needle-electrode distance, small grid-electrode distance, large needle-grid distance, relatively high needle voltage, and relatively long charging time more than 20 seconds are desirable. The front and back sides of corona charged polymer films usually share similar magnitude but opposite polarities of surface voltage. The surface voltage on each side decays over time, while the ratio of the voltmeter-measured surface voltage to the fieldmeter-measured voltage difference is nearly constant, independent of film material, charging condition, voltage decay rate, and time. This phenomenon {{can be explained by the}} dipolar charge injection model. A small variation in surface density of free charges, as small as ~ 0. 1 % of the surface density of dipolar charges, may drastically change the absolute value of surface voltage and sometimes, even the polarity. The amount of free charges and the associated surface voltage can be tailored through contact electrification (CE), for which the key parameters include the film material, the liquid composition, and the external electric field. Contact electrification can be applied on either neutral or electrified films. By combining corona charging (CC) and CE, we can precisely control the surface voltages of polymer films. As the surface density of CE-induced free charges is much smaller than that of CC-induced dipolar charges and the latter is inherently more stable, the decay rate of free charges is much faster and the dipolar component of charge distribution is much more stable. The change in voltage difference across the film thickness is often negligible...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{electrification}} {{of vehicles}} has been accelerated {{over the last}} few years due to tighter emission regulations, volatile fuel prices, and progress in standardization as well as improvement of battery technologies. Key hurdles of electric vehicles (EV) to gain a larger share in the automotive market are the cost of the energy storage system (ESS) and the density of the EV charging infrastructure. The achievable range of an EV or full electric driving of a plugin hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is limited by its battery capacity. The time to recharge the battery is related to the power level of charging as well as allowable <b>charging</b> <b>parameters</b> to protect the battery life. In order to overcome the constraints of limited range of EVs (all electric driving) as well as the cost of ESS, inductively coupled power transfer (ICPT) is an interesting technology path to be considered, in particular if applied as opportunity (stop-and-go) or in-motion charging (also called dynamic wireless charging or move and charge). In-motion wireless charging could lead to significant reductions of the vehicle-related cost of electrification but this comes with the price of an infrastructure that needs to be built and maintained. In order to design the ICPT infrastructure and calculate the cost of construction and operation, certain assumptions have to be made with respect to the vehicle specifications, the specification of the charging system itself and the cost of integration into the existing road infrastructure. The objective of this paper is to provide a thorough analysis of the cost associated with the implementation of a dynamic ICPT infrastructure to support the operation of electrified vehicles and to present transportation agencies a business model that can provide a starting point for the development of a new EV infrastructure...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{charging}} {{behavior of}} titanium oxide (anatase, rutile, and P 25) and the ion pair {{formation of the}} electrolyte ions with the surface groups have been extensively studied. A large number of titration and electrokinetic data sets available in the literature have been successfully described, using the MUSIC (MultiSite Complexation) model with a Basic Stern double-layer option and applying the ion pair formation concept. The systematic analysis of the data, over {{a large number of}} different monovalent electrolytes and various ionic strength values, allowed the determination of a number of "best estimated" values for the ion pair formation constants. The values suggest that the interaction of the cations with the titania surface is stronger than that of the anions. This is in accordance with the observed shift of the IEP of titanium oxide to higher pH values, at high electrolyte concentrations. The binding of the cations follows the sequence Cs NO 3 - > ClO 4 - > I-. Titanium oxide can be divided in two classes of materials, having a low (C = 0. 9 F m- 2) and a high (C = 1. 6 F m- 2) capacitance value, respectively. The low capacitance value corresponds with the low values found for well-crystallized gibbsite and goethite. On the basis of the low capacitance value and the absence of correlation with the dielectric properties of the solids, it is hypothesized that the first layer of physically adsorbed water has a unique relative dielectric constant of about 40 on well-crystallized oxides.
