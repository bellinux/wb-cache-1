Studies applying covert attentional orienting paradigms have shown that the right FEF is involved in attentional shifts to both {{the left and the right}} hemifield. In the current study, we aimed at examining the effects of inhibitory continuous theta burst (cTBS) transcranial magnetic stimulation over the right FEF on overt attentional orienting, as measured by a free visual exploration paradigm. In forty-two healthy subjects, free visual exploration of naturalistic pictures was tested in three conditions: (1) after cTBS over the right FEF; (2) after cTBS over a control site (vertex); and, (3) without any stimulation. The results showed that cTBS over the right FEF-but not cTBS over the vertex-triggered significant changes in the spatial distribution of the <b>cumulative</b> fixation <b>duration.</b> Compared to the group without stimulation and the group with cTBS over the vertex, cTBS over the right FEF decreased <b>cumulative</b> fixation <b>duration</b> in the left and in the right peripheral regions, and increased <b>cumulative</b> fixation <b>duration</b> in the central region.

40|$|Six rats {{were trained}} with food {{deliveries}} contingent upon their pressing a lever and holding {{it down for}} fixed, <b>cumulative</b> <b>durations.</b> Hold requirements were varied from 7. 5 seconds to 120 seconds. Lever holding was maintained reliably at hold requirements as long as 30 seconds to 105 seconds for different rats. At longer hold requirements, lever holding was erratic and tended to occur only early in sessions. At shorter and intermediate requirements, the patterns of lever holding resembled those of responding under fixed-ratio schedules for discrete responses, with breaks in responding immediately after reinforcement alternating with relatively continuous lever holding until the next reinforcement. At longer hold requirements, postpause lever holding frequently was interrupted with additional pauses. The duration of postreinforcement pauses increased linearly with the scheduled hold requirement. However, for five of six rats, the hold requirement, which represents the actual time spent lever holding per reinforcer, accounted for somewhat less variance in pause duration than did interreinforcement time...|$|R
40|$|The right {{posterior}} {{parietal cortex}} (PPC) is critically involved in visual exploration behaviour, and damage {{to this area}} may lead to neglect of the left hemispace. We investigated whether neglect-like visual exploration behaviour could be induced in healthy subjects using theta burst repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). To this end, one continuous train of theta burst rTMS was applied over the right PPC in 12 healthy subjects prior to a visual exploration task where colour photographs of real-life scenes were presented on a computer screen. In a control experiment, stimulation was also applied over the vertex. Eye movements were measured, {{and the distribution of}} visual fixations in the left and right halves of the screen was analysed. In comparison to the performance of 28 control subjects without stimulation, theta burst rTMS over the right PPC, but not the vertex, significantly decreased <b>cumulative</b> fixation <b>duration</b> in the left screen-half and significantly increased <b>cumulative</b> fixation <b>duration</b> in the right screen-half for a time period of 30 min.

Postreinforcement-pause duration increased with lever-holding time for both fixed- and variable-hold requirements. At comparable lever-holding times per reinforcer, longer pauses typically were produced by fixed requirements than by variable requirements. Data from this study on the maintenance of responding, temporal response patterns, and postreinforcement pausing are comparable to those obtained with intermittent reinforcement of discrete responses.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Limited {{research}} {{focuses on}} the risk of ischemic cerebrovascular disease associated with use of dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 inhibitors (DPP- 4 inhibitors) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Taiwan. This study aimed to investigate the association between DPP- 4 inhibitors use and the first episode of ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Methods: We designed a case-control study using the database of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Program. There were 1999 type 2 diabetic subjects aged 20 – 84 years with the first episode of ischemic cerebrovascular disease from 2000 to 2013 as the cases, and 7996 sex- and age-matched, randomly selected type 2 diabetic subjects aged 20 – 84 years without any type of cerebrovascular diseases as the matched controls. We estimated the odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) of ischemic cerebrovascular disease associated with <b>cumulative</b> <b>duration</b> of DPP- 4 inhibitors use by the multivariable logistic regression model. Results: After adjustment for confounding variables, the adjusted OR of ischemic cerebrovascular disease was 0. 96 (95 % CI 0. 95, 0. 97) in subjects with ever use of DPP- 4 inhibitors as increase in use duration for every 1 month, compared with never use. The sub-analysis disclosed that the adjusted ORs of ischemic cerebrovascular disease were 1. 57 (95 % CI 1. 36, 1. 80) for subjects with <b>cumulative</b> <b>duration</b> of DPP- 4 inhibitors use < 1 year, and 0. 70 (95 % CI 0. 57, 0. 87) for subjects with <b>cumulative</b> <b>duration</b> of DPP- 4 inhibitors use ≥ 1 year, compared with never use.

40|$|Hong Kong {{children}} are facing dual challenges of obesity and underweight. While {{the surge in}} obesity in the past 2 decades has drawn much attention, the substantial prevalence of underweight seems overlooked. Childhood obesity {{has been associated with}} low self-esteem (SE), but longitudinal data are scarce. Studies have considered the level of obesity at a certain time point, ignoring potential effects of the duration of suboptimal weight status (overweight or obesity and underweight). This study aimed to 1) assess the trend of suboptimal weight status in Hong Kong primary school children; 2) assess the prevalence of low SE; 3) assess cross-sectional associations between suboptimal weight status and low SE in Primary (P) 6 students; 4) assess prospective associations between duration of suboptimal weight status and low SE. Data (collected during academic year 1995 / 96 - 2001 / 02) were provided by the Student Health Service. Weight and height of children were measured yearly from P 1 to 6. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Age- and sex-specific BMI cut-offs equivalent to 25 at 18 years were used to identify underweight, overweight and obese children, respectively. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>duration</b> of overweight or obesity (CDO), consecutive years of overweight or obesity (CYO), <b>cumulative</b> <b>duration</b> of underweight (CDU) and consecutive years of underweight (CYU) were used to assess the duration of suboptimal weight status. Students having low total and domain-specific SE were identified using the Culture Free Self-esteem Inventories 2 nd Edition. Complete cases analysis was performed: 1) Binary logistic regression models were fitted to assess cross-sectional associations between weight status (independent variable) and SE (dependent variable) at P 6. 2) To evaluate the effects of duration of suboptimal weight status (independent variables: CDO, CYO, CDU and CYU) on SE (dependent variable), logistic regression models were fitted. Sex-stratified analyses were conducted. Socioeconomic proxies and lifestyle behaviours were adjusted. Overweight or obesity steadily (P 1 21. 5 %, P 6 32. 8 %) increased while underweight was stable (P 1 16. 7 %, P 6 16. 0 %) throughout follow-up period. More students were persistently (P 1 - 6) overweight or obese (15. 8 %) than underweight (6. 6 %). More boys than girls were overweight or obese. About 6 % of students (boys 6. 7 %, girls 5. 2 %) reported low SE at P 6. At P 6, overweight or obesity was significantly associated with low total, general, social and academic SE, while underweight was only related to low social SE. Prospectively, increased CDO and CYO predicted low total, general, social and academic SE. Increased CDU and CYU only predicted low social SE. Consecutive years of suboptimal weight status (CYO and CYU) was a stronger predictor of low SE than <b>cumulative</b> <b>duration</b> of suboptimal weight status (CDO and CDU). In conclusion, overweight or obesity increased from P 1 to P 6 in Hong Kong primary school children. Boys {{were more likely to be}} overweight or obesity and have low total SE than girls. Both longer <b>cumulative</b> <b>duration</b> and consecutive years of suboptimal weight status prospectively predicted low total SE and domain specific SE.

40|$|Interhemispheric {{imbalance}} {{is discussed}} as a pathophysiological mechanism in visuospatial neglect. It {{is suggested that}} after a lesion of the right hemisphere the mutual transcallosal inhibition is impaired, resulting in an increased activity of the left hemisphere. We investigated the interhemispheric balance of attention in healthy subjects by using a free visual exploration task and by interfering with the neural activity of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of either hemisphere using an inhibitory transcranial magnetic stimulation routine with theta burst stimulation (TBS). Subjects explored colour photographs of real-life scenes presented {{on a computer screen}} under four conditions: (i) without TBS; (ii) after TBS over the right PPC; (iii) after TBS over the left PPC; and (iv) after TBS over the right PPC and, after {{the first half of the}} task, over the left PPC. Eye movements were measured, and distribution of mean <b>cumulative</b> fixation <b>duration</b> over screen halves was analyzed. TBS over the right PPC resulted in a significant rightward shift of mean <b>cumulative</b> fixation <b>duration</b> of approximately 30 min. The shift could be reversed when a subsequent train of TBS was applied over the left PPC. However, left PPC stimulation alone had no significant effect on visual exploration behaviour.

Many {{older persons}} {{experience}} multiple transitions between states of disability and independence, but {{little is known}} about the effect of prior disability history on subsequent functional transitions. Our objective was to determine the effect of prior disability on subsequent transitions between no disability, mild disability, severe disability, and death. Methods. For 60 months, 754 persons aged 70 or older underwent monthly assessments of disability in basic activities of daily living. We used a multistate extension of the proportional hazards model to determine the effects of amount, defined as <b>cumulative</b> <b>duration,</b> and distribution, defined as number of episodes, of prior disability on subsequent functional transitions, adjusted for age, gender, cognitive status, timed gait, and habitual physical activity.

For each additional month of prior disability, participants were more likely to make transitions representing new or worsening disability and were less likely to make transitions from disability to independence or from severe disability to death. Adjusting for the <b>cumulative</b> <b>duration</b> of prior disability, more episodes of prior disability were associated with a higher likelihood of most transitions, representing both increasing and decreasing disability, but had no effect on transitions to death.

40|$|Objectives: The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the cardioprotective effect of sevoflurane compared with propofol in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing peripheral vascular surgery; and to address the question whether a volatile anesthetic might improve cardiac outcome in these patients. Methods: One hundred twenty-six patients scheduled for elective peripheral vascular surgery were prospectively randomized to receive either sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia or total intravenous anesthesia. ST-segment monitoring was performed continuously during intra- and post-operative 48 h periods. The number of ischemic events and the <b>cumulative</b> <b>duration</b> of ischemia in each patient were recorded. Blood was sampled in all patients for the determination of cTnI. Samples were obtained before the induction of anesthesia, on admission to the ICU, and at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients were followed-up during their hospital stay for any adverse cardiac events. Results: The incidence of ischemia were comparable among the groups [16 (25 %) patients in sevoflurane group vs 24 (39 %) patients in propofol group; P= 0. 126]. Duration, <b>cumulative</b> <b>duration,</b> and magnitude of ST-segment depression of ischemic events in each patient were significantly less in sevoflurane group (P= 0. 008, 0. 048, 0. 038, respectively). cTnI levels of the overall population were significantly less in sevoflurane group vs propofol group (P values < 0. 0001) from 6 h postoperative and onward. Meanwhile, cTnI levels at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after admission to the ICU in patients who presented with ischemic electrocardiographic (ECG) changes were significantly lower in sevoflurane group than in the propofol group (P< 0. 0001, < 0. 0001, < 0. 0001, 0. 0003). None of the patients presented with unstable angina, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or serious arrhythmia either during ICU or hospital stay.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} measured pigeons' choices between probabilistic reinforcers {{and certain}} but delayed reinforcers. In Experiment 1, a peck {{on a red}} key led to a 5 -s delay and then a possible reinforcer (with a probability of. 2). A peck on a green key led to a certain reinforcer after an adjusting delay. This delay was adjusted over trials so as to estimate an indifference point, or a duration at which the two alternatives were chosen about equally often. In all conditions, red houselights were present during the 5 -s delay on reinforced trials with the probabilistic alternative, but the houselight colors on nonreinforced trials differed across conditions. Subjects showed a stronger preference for the probabilistic alternative when the houselights were a different color (white or blue) during the delay on nonreinforced trials than when they were red on both reinforced and nonreinforced trials. These results supported {{the hypothesis that the}} value or effectiveness of a probabilistic reinforcer is inversely related to the cumulative time per reinforcer spent in the presence of stimuli associated with the probabilistic alternative. Experiment 2 tested some quantitative versions of this hypothesis by varying the delay for the probabilistic alternative (either 0 s or 2 s) and the probability of reinforcement (from. 1 to 1. 0).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} impact of a variety of methodological {{parameters}} on the association between six drug classes and five key adverse events in multiple databases. METHODS: The selection of Drug-Adverse Event pairs was based on public health impact, regulatory relevance, and the possibility to study a broad range of methodological issues. Common protocols and data analytical specifications were jointly developed and independently and blindly executed in different databases in Europe with replications in the same and different databases. RESULTS: The association between antibiotics and acute liver injury, benzodiazepines and hip fracture, antidepressants and hip fracture, inhaled long-acting beta 2 -agonists and acute myocardial infarction was consistent in direction across multiple designs, databases and methods to control for confounding. Some variation in magnitude of the associations was observed depending on design, exposure and outcome definitions, but none of the differences were statistically significant. The association between anti-epileptics and suicidality was inconsistent across the UK CPRD, Danish National registries and the French PGRx system. Calcium channel blockers were not associated with the risk of cancer in the UK CPRD, and this was consistent across different classes of calcium channel blockers, <b>cumulative</b> <b>durations</b> of use up to > 10 [*]years and different types of cancer.

In the present study, we investigated the influence of co-speech gestures on the perception of dyadic dialogue in aphasic patients. In particular, we analysed the impact of co-speech gestures on gaze direction (towards speaker or listener) and fixation of body parts. We hypothesized that aphasic patients, who are restricted in verbal comprehension, adapt their visual exploration strategies. METHODS Sixteen aphasic patients and 23 healthy control subjects participated in the study. Visual exploration behaviour was measured {{by means of a}} contact-free infrared eye-tracker while subjects were watching videos depicting spontaneous dialogues between two individuals. <b>Cumulative</b> fixation <b>duration</b> and mean fixation duration were calculated for the factors co-speech gesture (present and absent), gaze direction (to the speaker or to the listener), and region of interest (ROI), including hands, face, and body. RESULTS Both aphasic patients and healthy controls mainly fixated the speaker's face. We found a significant co-speech gesture × ROI interaction, indicating that the presence of a co-speech gesture encouraged subjects to look at the speaker. Further, there was a significant gaze direction × ROI × group interaction revealing that aphasic patients showed reduced <b>cumulative</b> fixation <b>duration</b> on the speaker's face compared to healthy controls. CONCLUSION Co-speech gestures guide the observer's attention towards the speaker, the source of semantic input. It is discussed whether an underlying semantic processing deficit or a deficit to integrate audio-visual information may cause aphasic patients to explore less the speaker's face...|$|R
