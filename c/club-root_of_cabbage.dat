Peroxidase activities in the clab－root tissue were shown about 2 times greater than in the healthy root <b>of</b> Chinese <b>cabbage</b> by E_ 's W_ manometric technique （Table 1 ）. Free sugars were determined by the paper chromatography, and sucrose, glucose and fructose were detected from both tissues <b>of</b> Chinese <b>cabbage</b> and turnip. It was found that sucrose was smaller in quantity in the <b>club－root</b> tis－sue <b>of</b> Chinese <b>cabbage</b> than in the healthy one, while glucose and fructosewere greater in quantity （Table 2 ）.

40|$|The elctron-microscopic {{studies on}} plant tissues are at present {{scarcely}} known､and {{a similar study}} on the <b>club-root</b> tissues <b>of</b> crucifers has also not yetbeen done. WORONIN,CooK and SCHWARTZ and some other investigators studied on {{the life cycle of}} the causal organism by means of the ordinal microscope,though some features of the life history remain still obscure. This article deals with the electron-microscopic observation on the <b>club-root</b> tissues <b>of</b> Chinese <b>cabbage</b> (Brassica chinensis L.; Nozaki N 0. 2 variety) infected with Plasmodeopora brassicae WOR. which were collected in Yamaguti Pref.,were carried out by means of ultra-thin sectioning･ The material tissues were fixed with 1 % osmic acid (M/ 15 phosphate buffer,pH 6. 0) and embeded with methacrylate plastics and sectioned by ultra microtometo be thinner than 0. 05 μ. The results obtained by the observations on the electron-micrographs are as follows: 1. In the protoplasm of plasmodium of the causal organism, several nuclei,many cytoplasmic granules and some mitochondria were observed. The mitochon-drium is a small rod-shaped sheathed body, averaging about 0. 3 × 1. 5 μin size and the mitochondrial membrane seems to be doubled. The existence of abundant mitochondria in the plasmodium seems to be significant as it closely co-relates tothe increased metabolic activities in the diseased tissues. 2. Each mononucleate spore divided from plasmodium contains a single nucleus in its center and electron-dense granules in its cytoplasm. 3. Many sharp-pointed prickles were found on the outer membrane of each mononucleate spore...|$|R

40|$|Cabbage is a main {{ingredient}} in okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake), and while its sweetness determines the preference characteristics, {{the levels of}} vitamin C (VC) and other vitamins determine the nutritional qualities. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effects <b>of</b> the <b>cabbage</b> used in making okonomiyaki on food (nutrient) composition. Variability in degrees Brix (°Bx) and the VC level <b>of</b> <b>cabbage</b> used in making Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki was examined. In Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki, the °Bx <b>of</b> <b>cabbage</b> is elevated and sweetness shows an increasing trend. In addition, the method <b>of</b> placing steamed <b>cabbage</b> on top <b>of</b> noodles and then applying pressure allows for a high rate of residual VC.

40|$|Diamondback moth (DBM) Plutella xylostella is an {{economical}} pest <b>of</b> <b>cabbage.</b> Chemical pesticides constitute so far {{the major}} tool for pest management. However, the use of botanical pesticides and microbial is also considered. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the effect of alternating treatments of Bacillus thuringiensis and Neem on agronomic particulars <b>of</b> <b>cabbage</b> as compared to solo and chemical applications. Results showed that the alternation of B. thuringiensis and Neem, performed as well as solo. Agronomic parameters were strongly related to the level of infestation of P. xylostella and other pests. The number of leaves was higher in the control and Dimethoate treatments depicting higher response to severe damages, whereas diameters <b>of</b> <b>cabbage</b> heads were higher in the Biobit and Neem treatments. There was no significant difference between the Biobit and the alternated treatment in terms <b>of</b> weight <b>of</b> <b>cabbage.</b> The diameter <b>of</b> <b>cabbage</b> treated with Biobit was higher than those treated with an alternated treatment. However, there was no significant difference between the alternated treatment and Neem. On the other hand, there was significant correlation between agronomic parameters and the presence of parasitoids. The correlation was significantly greater between the number of leaves, diameter and weight <b>of</b> <b>cabbage</b> in the presence of Oomyzus sokolowskii. These results indicate that timely application of alternated treatments of B. thuringiensis and Neem can be more economically viable as compared to single treatments and should be adopted in integrated pest management programs for cabbage.
