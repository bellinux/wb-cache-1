25|$|The <b>cycle</b> <b>lane</b> {{network has}} been criticised {{for a number}} of reasons. Motor traffic is often too fast, and there is no {{physical}} barrier between bicyclists and motorists. Most bicycle lanes in the city are marked out with parking spaces for motorist parking, making those lanes 'pointless' and raising the risk of motorists opening car doors into the path of passing bicyclists.|$|E
25|$|Local {{transportation}} is primarily by bus or taxi.

Due to the flat topography of the city centre, bicycles are popular. Almost all roads have a wide <b>cycle</b> <b>lane</b> on each side. Often this lane is further protected by a traffic island that separates the bikes from larger motor vehicles.|$|E

Many were built with planning covenants granting river access, but these are now often barred to the public. Vehicular access is limited, as the area is cut off by the entrance to the Limehouse tunnel and parking is strictly controlled, however this makes the area reasonably quiet for cyclists. Public access to the foreshore is prohibited, apparently part of the security arrangements for former Foreign Secretary, David Owen. The National Cycle Route 1 also runs in Limehouse north and south.|$|E
25|$|In August 2011, Streatham was {{selected}} {{as one of the}} areas to benefit from Round 1 of the Mayor of London's Outer London Fund, gaining £300,000. Later, Streatham was awarded a further £1.6 million, matched by another £1 million by Lambeth. The money from this fund was spent on improving streets and public spaces in Streatham. This includes the smartening up of shop fronts through painting and cleaning, replacing shutters and signage as well as helping to reveal facilities behind the high street such as The Stables Community Centre. Streatham Library has also undergone a £1.2 million refurbishment. The Tudor Hall behind the library was brought back into public use as The Mark Bennett Centre providing a meeting and performance space. The central reservation along the A23 is being removed, which involves some repaving and resurfacing, planting of new trees, and the creation of an enlarged bus and <b>cycle</b> <b>lane.</b> Streatham Skyline introduced new lighting to highlight some of Streatham's more attractive buildings and monuments with the aim of improving safety and the overall attractiveness of the area.|$|E

In February 2004, he launched the new Central Sydney Bicycle map, which shares information on the easiest ways to cycle around Sydney. In May 2005, as part of the Greenhouse Advisory Panel, he advocated for car registration fees to link with engine size, to help people focus on their greenhouse impact and environmental footprint. He agrees with Danish urban planner's blueprint for a better Sydney, commenting in 2007 that pedestrian access should be improved in the heart of Sydney, including marked lanes for cyclists. He had made similar <b>cycle</b> <b>lane</b> commentary in April 2003 for an article about what he would institute if he were City of Sydney's Lord Mayor. For the first day of hosting breakfast for ABC 702, he cycled 4 kilometres to work for his 5:30am shift. He is often spotted around Sydney, pedalling or wearing his bike helmet and cycling clothes.|$|E

2500|$|One {{method for}} {{reducing}} potential friction between cyclists and motorized vehicles {{is to provide}} [...] "wide kerb", or [...] "nearside", lanes (UK terminology) or [...] "wide outside through lane" [...] (U.S. terminology). These extra-wide lanes increase the probability that motorists pass cyclists {{at a safe distance}} without having to change lanes. This is held to be particularly important on routes with a high proportion of wide vehicles such as buses or heavy goods vehicles (HGVs). They also provide more room for cyclists to filter past queues of cars in congested conditions and to safely overtake each other. Due to the tendency of all vehicle users to stay in the center of their lane, it would be necessary to sub-divide the <b>cycle</b> <b>lane</b> with a broken white line to facilitate safe overtaking. Overtaking is indispensable for cyclists, as speeds are not dependent on the legal speed limit, but on the rider's capability.The use of such lanes is specifically endorsed by Cycling: the way ahead for towns and cities, the European Commission policy document on cycle promotion. The UK Cyclists Touring Club argues for a marked lane width of 4.25m (14ft). It is argued that, on undivided roads, this width provides cyclists with adequate clearance from passing wide vehicles while being sufficiently narrow to deter motorists from attempting to [...] "double up" [...] and form two lanes. This [...] "doubling up" [...] effect may be related to junctions. At non-junction locations, greater width might be preferable if this effect can be avoided.|$|E

40|$|AbstractToday some <b>cycle</b> <b>lanes</b> are {{reaching}} {{high levels of}} flow. Clear examples are the cycle-track Pocuro in Santiago de Chile and the cycle-lane Tavistock Square in London. The problem presented in this research {{is the lack of}} measurements for estimating the capacity of <b>cycle</b> <b>lanes</b> at traffic signals. Therefore, it cannot be identified through indicators whether <b>cycle</b> <b>lanes</b> are saturated or not. For this reason there is no record of the capacity they can offer. As a methodology we established four steps. Firstly, we measured the physical and operational variables of <b>cycle</b> <b>lanes,</b> and we investigated about international studies related to their capacities. Then we used the approach of the Road Note 34 (RRL, 1963) to measure the saturation flow and transient periods of <b>cycle</b> <b>lanes,</b> taking as case study Santiago de Chile and London. In addition, we defined different scenarios of experiments. Finally, the results were transformed into design recommendations to provide an adequate level of service for cyclists. The main results of this research shows that the saturation flow grows almost linearly with the width. When cyclists formed in lanes, the saturation flow increased only if a new lane was formed. In the case of the cycle-track Pocuro, for a width of 1. 0 m the saturation flow reached 2070 bicycle/h-lane. If the width increased to 2. 0 m, the saturation flow reached 4657 bicycle/h-lane. In relation to Tavistock Square, this cycle-lane (width of 1. 0 m) reached a saturation flow of 4320 bicycle/h-lane. As a conclusion, this research can be used by traffic engineers to estimate the saturation flow of <b>cycle</b> <b>lanes</b> and delays of cyclists at traffic signals. This in turn can help in designing cycle facilities at transport infrastructures. The validation of our investigation can also help transport planners with the calculation of the capacity, optimum width, comfort, and other operational costs of <b>cycle</b> <b>lanes...</b>|$|R

5000|$|In the United Kingdom and Germany {{there is}} some concern {{to the use of}} <b>cycle</b> <b>lanes</b> in large urban roundabouts, though it is still common to see such {{facilities}} in the Netherlands and elsewhere. In 2002, <b>cycle</b> <b>lanes</b> were removed from a roundabout in the English town of Weymouth after 20 months because the casualty rate had increased significantly, according to the local cycling campaign. German research has indicated that cyclists are safer negotiating roundabouts in traffic rather than on separate <b>cycle</b> <b>lanes</b> or <b>cycle</b> paths. A recent paper on German roundabout design practice states [...] "Cycle lanes at the peripheral margin of the circle are not allowed since they are very dangerous to cyclists".|$|R

25|$|Traditional <b>cycle</b> <b>lanes</b> {{increase}} vehicle/bicycle collisions. When exiting, a motorist {{must look}} ahead to avoid colliding with another vehicle or with pedestrians on a crosswalk. As the intersection curves away from the exit, the path of an exiting vehicle is relatively straight, and so the motorist may often not slow substantially. To {{give way to a}} cyclist on the outside, requires the exiting motorist to look toward the rear, to the perimeter. Other vehicles can obstruct the driver's view in this direction, complicating the motorist's task. The more frequent requirements for motorists to slow or stop reduce traffic flow. A 1992 study found that the risk to cyclists is high in all such intersections, but much higher when the junction has a marked bicycle lane or sidepath around its perimeter. <b>Cycle</b> <b>lanes</b> were installed at St. John's roundabout in Newbury, Berkshire, England and at Museum Road, Portsmouth, England. The <b>cycle</b> <b>lanes</b> at Museum Road were replaced by a narrowed carriageway to encourage lane sharing, while the St. John's roundabout retains perimeter <b>cycle</b> <b>lanes.</b>|$|R
