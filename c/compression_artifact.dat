40|$|Abstract: An {{effective}} <b>compression</b> <b>artifacts</b> removal {{algorithm is}} proposed based on thin-plate spline interpolation and the theory of projections onto convex sets (POCS). The thin-plate spline model is used to model the luminance in the flat regions of the image. Adaptive projections are used to suppress the <b>compression</b> <b>artifacts</b> in the spatially active image regions. The algorithm includes block mapping, prediction of the spatial distribution of the quantization error and estimation of the visibility of the <b>compression</b> <b>artifacts.</b> Information obtained from the transform domain {{is used in the}} thin-plate interpolation phase. The adaptive projections use information from both the spatial and transform domains. Experiments performed with JPEG-compressed images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in suppressing the <b>compression</b> <b>artifacts,</b> along with its ability for preserving the image sharpness...|$|R

40|$|In decoded digital video, {{the local}} perceptual <b>{{compression}}</b> <b>artifact</b> level {{depends on the}} global compression ratio and the local video content. In this paper, we show {{how to build a}} highly relevant metric for video compression artifacts using supervised learning. To obtain the ground truth for training, we first build a reference metric for local estimation of the artifact level, which is robust to scaling and sensitive to all types of compression artifacts. Next, we design a large feature set and use AdaBoost to create no-reference metrics trained with the output of the reference metric. Two separate trained no-reference metrics, one for flat and one for detailed areas, respectively, are necessary to cover all types of artifacts. The relevance of these metrics is validated in a <b>compression</b> <b>artifact</b> reduction application, using objective scores like PSNR and BIM, but also a subjective evaluation as proof. We conclude that our created reference metric is an accurate local estimator of the <b>compression</b> <b>artifact</b> level. We were able to copy the performance to two no-reference metrics, based on a weighted mixture of low-level features. Our new metrics enable a far superior performance of artifact reduction compared to relevant alternative proposals...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{accordance}} with the recent improvement {{in the quality of}} image displays for consumer electronics, digital image compression artifacts are visible than ever. Noise removable methods are key issues not only in research areas such as image sensing and satellite imaging but also in consumer electronics such as television signal conversion, DVD and Blu-ray encodings. Among various <b>compression</b> <b>artifact</b> removable methods, the Total Variation (TV) regularization method {{is one of the most}} promising solutions. However, there are two problems: one is loss of image minuteness in the texture components, and the other is insufficient <b>compression</b> <b>artifact</b> removal in low bit rates. In this paper, we propose a new noise removable method utilizing the TV regularization method for moving pictures compressed by MPEG- 2. We obtain fine experimental results in image quality improvement, and our method is possible to be applied to the other DCT based-imag...|$|E

40|$|By the {{application}} of lossy data compression, distortion will occur for media. This media can be image, audio, or video. <b>Compression</b> <b>artifact</b> {{is one of the}} noticeable distortion of media which occur as a result of lossy data compression. At high compression ratios, the visibility of image degradations {{is one of the most}} important drawback of the current video coding standards. Due to the rigid block partitioning of the image, these image degradations leads to blocking artifacts and due to coarse quantization it leads to ringing noise mainlys around edges. Both the blocking and ringing noise are visibly annoying and have a great impact on the received image quality. So, for improving the quality of the reconstructed image we must remove the blocking and ringing noise. In some techniques, blocking noise will be removed from the image, but there will be large amount of blurriness. This paper is a survey on various <b>compression</b> <b>artifact</b> removal techniques...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, an {{integrated}} resolution up-conversion and compression artifacts removal algorithm is proposed. Local image patterns are classified into object details or coding artifacts using {{the combination of}} structure information and activity measure. For each pattern class, the weighting coefficients for up-scaling and artifact reduction are optimized by a Least Mean Square (LMS) training technique, which trains on {{the combination of the}} original images and the compressed down-sampled versions of the original images. The proposed combined algorithm is proven to be more effective than previous classification based techniques in concatenation.

The LT coefficients are rearranged into the octave based representation, and their statistics are modeled by the same methods as the wavelet coefficients. Since the part of the LT that follows the discrete cosine transform (DCT) is orthogonal, the problem of removing the quantization noise introduced in the DCT based codecs can be solved in the LT domain. The maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator is obtained, which provides a novel approach to the image <b>compression</b> <b>artifact</b> reduction problem. The proposed method removes the additive noise and the quantization noise effectively with the significant improvement of image quality. ope...|$|E

40|$|Lossy image {{compression}} allows for large storage savings {{but at the}} cost of reduced fidelity of the compressed images. There is a fair amount of literature aiming at restoration by suppressing the compression artifacts. Very recently a learned semi-local Gaussian Processes-based solution (SLGP) has been proposed with impressive results. However, when ap-plied to top compression schemes such as JPEG 2000, the improvement is less significant. In our paper we propose an efficient novel artifact reduction algorithm based on the adjusted anchored neighborhood regression (A+), a method from image super-resolution literature.

30|$|Transfer {{learning}} in deep neural networks becomes popular since {{the success of}} deep {{learning in}} image classification [19]. The features learned from the ImageNet show good generalization ability [36] and become {{a powerful tool for}} several high-level vision problems. Many works have demonstrated that transfer of the network parameters learned from the ImageNet to their own network can improve performance. Inspired by the success of transfer learning applied in high-level vision problems, Dong et al. [9] explored several transfer settings on <b>compression</b> <b>artifact</b> reduction and demonstrated the effectiveness of transfer learning in low-level vision problems. Different from these transfer learning approaches mentioned above, we propose to transfer the parameters from a precomputed projection matrix that makes our network can make full use of the image prior and improve SR performance.|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} mean-squared-error and peak-signal-to-noise-ratio error {{measures are}} mainly {{focused on the}} pixel-by-pixel difference between the original and com-pressed images. Such metrics are improper for subjective quality assessment, since human perception is very sensitive to specific correlations between adjacent pixels. In this work, we explore the Haar wavelet to model the space–frequency localization property of human visual system (HVS) responses. It is shown that the physical con-trast in different resolutions can be easily represented in terms of wavelet coefficients. By analyzing and modeling several visual mechanisms of the HVS with the Haar transform, we develop a new subjective fidelity measure which is more consistent with human observation experience.
