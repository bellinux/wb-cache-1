He batted [...]296 and amassed 122 hits, 9 triples, 45 RBI and hit 3 home runs, though he also recorded the third highest number of strikeouts in the AL with 93. Although his defense was never stellar, he executed two noted plays that season. He made a one-handed stop against the Chicago White Sox that was described as [...] "marvelous" [...] by The New York Times and held the Yankees (his former team) to a 3–3 draw when Ball, serving as the <b>cut-off</b> <b>man,</b> successfully relayed the ball thrown from right fielder Shoeless Joe Jackson to catcher Gus Fisher. In doing so, he nailed Birdie Cree (who represented the Yankees' winning run) at home plate and the game was immediately suspended due to darkness. However, in a rematch against the White Sox on May 5, 1912, Ball suffered a momentary defensive lapse that ultimately cost his team the game. In the sixth inning, he was unable to catch Shano Collins stealing second base and then inexplicably held onto the ball. This allowed Ping Bodie to advance to home plate and score the winning run. On June 25, the Boston Red Sox purchased Ball's contract from the Naps for $2,500 ($ in today's dollars).|$|E
2500|$|Game 1 was a pitcher′s duel {{between the}} Nationals′ hard-throwing Stephen Strasburg, whose fastball reached 98 {{miles per hour}} (158 km/hr), and Chicago′s soft-tossing Kyle Hendricks, known for a fastball that topped out at 88 miles per hour (142 km/hr) at best. Strasburg {{had a very strong}} outing, {{pitching}} a no-hitter through the first five innings, allowing only a single Cub to reach base when shortstop Addison Russell walked {{in the top of the}} second. In the top of the sixth inning, however, Nationals third baseman Anthony Rendon dropped Chicago second baseman Javier Báez′s routine chopper up the third-base line, Rendon′s first error since July 22, allowing Báez to lead off the inning by reaching first base. Hendricks then advanced Báez to second on a sacrifice bunt, Báez becoming the first Cub to reach second base during the game. Right fielder Ben Zobrist followed by flying out to center field, pushing Strasburg′s no-hitter to 5⅔ innings, but in the next at-bat, third baseman Kris Bryant finally broke up the no-hit bid, singling to right, scoring Báez and advancing to second when right fielder Bryce Harper overthrew the <b>cut-off</b> <b>man.</b> First baseman Anthony Rizzo followed immediately with a single that scored Bryant. Catcher Willson Contreras grounded out to end the sixth inning, and Strasburg returned to pitch a perfect seventh inning, leaving the game after giving up only two hits, no earned runs, and one walk while striking out 10 Cubs, but with the Nationals behind 2-0. Strasburg′s 10 strikeouts were a postseason single-game record for the Montreal-Washington franchise.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{differences}} between men and women in incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) and its precursors, screening programs consistently use the same strategy for both genders. The objective of this article is to illustrate the effects of gender-tailored screening, including the effects on miss rates of advanced neoplasia (AN). Participants (age 50 - 75 years) in a colonoscopy screening program were asked to complete a fecal immunochemical test (FIT) before colonoscopy. Positivity rates, sensitivity and specificity for detection of AN at multiple cut-offs were determined. Absolute numbers of detected and missed AN per 1000 screenees were calculated. In total 1, 256 individuals underwent FIT and colonoscopy, 51 % male (median age 61 years; IQR 56 - 66) and 49 % female (median age 60 years; IQR 55 - 65). At all <b>cut-offs</b> <b>men</b> had higher positivity rates than women, ranging from 3. 8 % to 10. 8 % versus 3. 2 % to 4. 8 %.

50|$|This {{series is}} notable for a {{defensive}} {{play in the}} seventh inning of Game 3. With Oakland leading the five-game series two games to none, on the verge of completing a sweep, the Yankees took a 1-0 lead {{into the bottom of the}} seventh inning behind a strong performance from Mike Mussina and Jorge Posada's home run in the fifth (Shane Spencer followed with a double for the Yankees' only other hit of the game). With two outs and Jeremy Giambi on first base, Terrence Long hit a line drive into the right field corner. With Giambi rounding third base, right fielder Shane Spencer's throw missed both <b>cut-off</b> <b>men.</b> It appeared that Giambi would score easily, tying the game, when the shortstop Derek Jeter, while running across the diamond, reached out, cradled the ball, and shovel passed it to catcher Jorge Posada. Posada tagged Giambi, who attempted to jump over the tag as opposed to sliding around it. ESPN ranks this play as the 45th most memorable moment of the last 25 years. It would be replayed countless times over the following years, most recently as part of filmmaker Ken Burns's documentary The Tenth Inning in late September 2010. After the game, Jeter told the press that the team had been practicing this type of play all year as a result of a similarly botched throw in spring training. According to Jeter, the idea of stationing the shortstop down the first base line on balls hit to deep right field came from Yankee bench coach Don Zimmer, who was a shortstop and second baseman during his playing career; however, he stated that his initial intent was to throw the ball to third to try to get Long, and that his throw home was a reaction play. Zimmer confirmed the origin of the play's design in a conversation with Oakland's third base coach Ron Washington the next day.|$|R

50|$|In {{the bottom}} of the 9th, pinch-hitter Matty Alou, batting for relief pitcher Billy O'Dell, led off the inning with a bunt base hit after first having a foul ball dropped, but Terry struck out the next two batters, Felipe Alou and Hiller. Mays hit a double into the right field corner, but Maris brilliantly played the carom, then hit <b>cut-off</b> <b>man</b> Richardson with a throw that was relayed {{perfectly}} to home. Alou, already aware of Maris' great arm, stopped at third. Facing Willie McCovey with two outs, Terry elected to pitch to him rather than walk the bases loaded and bring up Orlando Cepeda. Terry's inside fastball on the second pitch completely handcuffed McCovey, who nonetheless adjusted his bat in mid-swing to extend his arms and hit what he later claimed was the hardest ball he had ever struck. The line drive appeared at first to be going over the head of a perfectly positioned Richardson, but was in fact sinking from topspin, and Richardson made the catch without leaping to end the game. The Yankees won their 20th World Championship; they would not win another World Championship until 1977.|$|E

40|$|Background: Undernutrition is {{a problem}} in {{institutional}} care, where 20 – 46 % of all inpatients are classified as being “at nutritional risk”. This study explores the prevalence of undernutrition risk and overweight/obesity and the targeting of nutritional care in relation to undernutrition risk among inpatients in southwestern Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross-sectional, point prevalence study was carried out in a Central hospital in southwestern Saudi Arabia. The subjects were inpatients, over the age of 18 who had their nutritional status assessed. Moderate/high undernutrition risk was defined as the occurrence of at least two of: weight loss, low BMI, and/or eating difficulties. Overweight/obesity was graded by using Caucasian and Asian cut-offs for BMI. Results: Out of 219 patients 166 (76 %) agreed to participate (106 men and 60 women) with a significantly higher drop-out among women (n= 35, 37 % vs. men n= 18, 14 %). There {{was no significant difference in}} the prevalence of moderate/high undernutrition risk between men and women (40 % vs. 38 %) but more women (29 % or 40 %, depending on <b>cut-off)</b> than <b>men</b> (10 % or 23 %) were obese.

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Proportion of Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR) is an {{indicator}} of abdominal obesity, which is supported by some studies but rejected by others. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the accuracy of the WHR and obtain suitable cut- off points for detecting obesity among adult Iranians. Materials & Methods: In this cross-sectional-descriptive study the sample consisted of 19366 adults. The data collection took place from 2009 to 2014, using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA). The following data were obtained: WHR, Percentile of Body Fat (PBF), To-tal Fat (TF), and Soft Lean Mass (SLM). Sensitivity and specificity, based on World Health Organization’s Gold Standards were calculated for both sexes at three age groups. The data analysis included t-test, chi-square, ROC curve, and linear regression. Results: All study variables were correlated with each other. Age was only correlated with the WHR. Percentages of sensitivity and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) were 84. 2 % and 85. 6 % in women; 21 % and 50. 7 % in men. Increase in age was associated with increase in sensitivity in men and women, and NPV in <b>men.</b> The suitable <b>cut-off</b> points for <b>men</b> and women were found to be 87. 5 % and 83. 5 %, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{an ongoing}} debate about the {{applicability}} of current criteria for large waist circumference (WC) in older adults. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to explore cut-off values for large WC in adults aged 70 years and older, using previously used and new methods. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Data of 1049 participants of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) (1995 - 1996), aged 70 - 88 y, were used. MEASUREMENTS: Measured BMI and WC, and self-reported mobility limitations. RESULTS: Linear regression analyses showed that the values of WC corresponding to BMI of 25 kg/m 2 and 30 kg/m 2 were higher than the current cut-offs. <b>Cut-offs</b> found in <b>men</b> were 97 and 110 cm, whereas 88 and 98 cm represented the cut-offs in women. Areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves showed that the accuracy to predict mobility limitations improved when the higher cut-offs were applied. Spline regression curves showed that the relationship of WC with mobility limitations was U-shaped in men, while in women, the risk for mobility limitations increased gradually with increasing WC. However, {{at the level of}} current cut-off values for WC the odds for mobility limitations were not increased. CONCLUSION: Based on results of extensive analyses, this study suggests that the cut-offs for large WC should be higher when applied to older adults.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) testing in serum has revolutionized the detection {{and management of}} men with prostate cancer. This review will highlight some of the exciting {{new developments in the}} field of prostate cancer screening in general and from our SPORE research program at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. First, {{it is important to understand}} that the inherent variability of tPSA levels affects the interpretation of any single results. Total variation in tPSA includes both analytical (i. e., pre-analytical sample handling, laboratory processing, assay performance, and standardization) and biological variation (i. e., metabolism, renal elimination, medication, physical and sexual activity, size and integrity of the prostate). Second, recent evidence demonstrates that no single tPSA <b>cut-off</b> separates <b>men</b> at high risk for prostate cancer from men at low risk or men with "significant" (high grade, high volume) cancer from those with low grade, indolent cancer. Taken together with a man's age, family history, ethnicity, and digital rectal exam results, tPSA levels add to the overall estimate of the risk of cancer, allowing men to share in the decision about a biopsy. Third, men who will eventually develop prostate cancer have increased tPSA levels years or decades before the cancer is diagnosed. These tPSA levels may reflect the long duration of prostate carcinogenesis and raise the question about a causal role for tPSA in prostate cancer development and progression. Total prostate-specific antigen measurements before age 50 could help risk stratify men for intensity of prostate cancer screening. Fourth, enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of tPSA, especially its specificity, is of particular importance, since higher specificity translates into fewer biopsies in men not affected by prostate cancer. While tPSA velocity has been shown to improve the specificity of tPSA, its sensitivity is too low to avoid prostate biopsy in a patient with an elevated tPSA level. Moreover, prospective screening studies have reported that tPSA velocity does not add diagnostic value beyond tPSA level. At this time, tPSA velocity appears most useful after diagnosis and after treatment, but its value in screening and prognostication remains to be shown. Finally, while free PSA molecular isoforms and human kallikrein-related peptidase 2 (hK 2) hold the promise for detection, staging, prognosis, and monitoring of prostate cancer, evidence from large prospective clinical trials remain to be reported...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundAssessment {{of muscle}} wasting in COPD is {{relevant}} {{as it is}} independently associated with metabolic and functional consequences and even survival. Muscle wasting can be approached by assessing fat free mass (FFM), but it is already demonstrated that FFM measured by bio-electrical impedance analysis (BIA) underestimates FFM measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (FFMDExA) in a relatively small COPD group. ObjectiveTo evaluated critical points for defining muscle wasting in a large cohort of moderate to severe COPD patients and with DEXA scan as reference. DesignFFM by BIA was compared with FFMDExA in 1087 COPD patients (641 ♂, FEV 1 : 44. 8 ± 17. 5 %pred). In a subgroup (n= 422), FFMDExA was predicted by multivariate analysis and a new formula to calculate FFM by BIA was developed. The new formula was compared with FFMDExA in the remaining subgroup (n= 665). Muscle wasting was defined according to the cut-offs of Schols et al. (FFM index (FFMI) < 16 kg/m 2 for men, 15 kg/m 2 for women), Vestbo et al. (FFMI< 17. 1 kg/m 2 for men, 14. 6 kg/m 2 for women), and Coin et al. (FFMI< 17. 8 kg/m 2 for men, 14. 6 kg/m 2 for women). ResultsThere was an underestimation of FFM by BIA when compared to FFMDExA by the Bland Altman. Comparing the new formula with FFMDExA, the mean underestimation almost disappeared but the variation remained. The proportion of muscle wasting was largely dependent on the used <b>cut-offs,</b> especially in <b>men.</b> ConclusionThe {{results of the present}} study emphasize the importance to accurately bare in mind the technique and cut-offs to establish muscle wasting before implementing it in the clinical practice...|$|R

We excluded participants who had diabetes or fasting serum glucose ≥ 7 mmol/L. Finally, 11, 121 subjects (4, 911 men, 3, 597 premenopausal women, 2, 613 postmenopausal women) were enrolled. The modified Adult Treatment Panel III criteria were used to define metabolic syndrome. The mean HOMA-IR was 2. 11 (2. 07 - 2. 15) for men, 2. 0 (1. 97 - 2. 04) for premenopausal women, and 2. 14 (2. 2 - 2. 19) for postmenopausal women. The first <b>cut-off</b> values in <b>men,</b> premenopausal women, and postmenopausal women were 2. 23 (sensitivity 70. 6 %, specificity 66. 9 %), 2. 39 (sensitivity 72. 3 %, specificity 76. 4 %), and 2. 48 (sensitivity 51. 9 %, specificity 80. 2 %), respectively. Based on the first HOMA-IR cut-off value, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 22. 9 % in men, 13. 7 % in premenopausal women, and 51. 6 % in postmenopausal women. The second cut-off value was around 3. 2 in all three groups. Based on the second HOMA-IR cut-off value, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 50. 8 % in men, 42. 5 % in premenopausal women, and 71. 6 % in postmenopausal women. In conclusion, the first cut-off values for HOMA-IR were 2. 2 - 2. 5 and the second cut-off value was 3. 2 in Korea. The distribution of HOMA-IR showed differences according to gender and menopausal status.

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{took place}} {{to enable the}} {{measurement}} of the effects on mental health of a psychosocial intervention in Rwanda. It aimed to establish the capacities of the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ- 20) to screen for mental disorder and to assess symptom change over time in a Rwandan community setting. Methods The SRQ- 20 was translated into Kinyarwanda {{in a process of}} forward and back-translation. SRQ- 20 data were collected in a Rwandan setting on 418 respondents; a random subsample of 230 respondents was assessed a second time with a three month time interval. Internal reliability was tested using Cronbach's alpha. The optimal cut-off point was determined by calculating Receiver Operating Curves, using semi-structured clinical interviews as standard in a random subsample of 99 respondents. Subsequently, predictive value, likelihood ratio, and interrater agreement were calculated. The factor structure of the SRQ- 20 was determined through exploratory factor analysis. Factorial invariance over time was tested in a multigroup confirmatory factor analysis. Results The reliability of the SRQ- 20 in women (α = 0. 85) and men (α = 0. 81) could be considered good. The instrument performed moderately well in detecting common mental disorders, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0. 76 for women and 0. 74 for <b>men.</b> <b>Cut-off</b> scores were different for women (10) and men (8). Factor analysis yielded five factors, explaining 38 % of the total variance. The factor structure proved to be time invariant. Conclusions The SRQ- 20 {{can be used as a}} screener to detect mental disorder in a Rwandan community setting, but cut-off scores need to be adjusted for women and men separately. The instrument also shows longitudinal factorial invariance, which is an important prerequisite for assessing changes in symptom severity. This is a significant finding as in non-western post-conflict settings the relevance of diagnostic categories is questionable. The use of the SRQ- 20 can be considered an alternative option for measuring the effect of a psychosocial intervention on mental health.

DESIGN: In 1993 / 1994 a health interview survey (the Curacao Health Study) was carried out among a random sample (n = 2248, response rate = 85 %) of the adult non-institutionalized population of Curacao. METHODS: We analyzed the association between obesity (BMI {{greater than or equal}} to 30), abdominal fatness (waist hip ratio (WHR) {{greater than or equal to}} 0. 95 for men, WHR greater than or equal to 0. 80 for women) waist circumference (WC greater than or equal to 100 cm for men, WC greater than or equal to 91 cm for women) and socioeconomic status (SES) by age adjusted logistic regressions, for men and women separately. RESULTS: The prevalence of obesity was about 27 %: 36 % of the women and 19 % of the men were obese. An at risk WHR was reported among 62. 2 % of the women and among 20. 4 % of the men. A WC above the cut-off point was reported for 44. 3 % women and 25. 3 % men. Compared to women of higher SES, the lower SES women have a two to three times higher risk of a BMI, WHR or WC exceeding the <b>cut-off</b> points. Among <b>men,</b> no statistically significant difference between an increased BMI, WHR or WC and SES factors was found. The overlap between the three measures is large, about 56 % of the women scored similarly on all three measurements. Among men the overlap is even greater (73 %). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of obesity in Curacao is alarming. Low SES women are at the greatest risk of an increased BMI, WHR or WC. The obesity figures can be placed between industrialized societies and less modernized cultures. Action and additional research on the prevention of obesity in Curacao are deemed necessary. The cut-off points in our study for WC in the non-white population are preliminary and need to be elucidated further...|$|R
40|$|Background: This study {{took place}} {{to enable the}} {{measurement}} of the effects on mental health of a psychosocial intervention in Rwanda. It aimed to establish the capacities of the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ- 20) to screen for mental disorder and to assess symptom change over time in a Rwandan community setting. Methods. The SRQ- 20 was translated into Kinyarwanda {{in a process of}} forward and back-translation. SRQ- 20 data were collected in a Rwandan setting on 418 respondents; a random subsample of 230 respondents was assessed a second time with a three month time interval. Internal reliability was tested using Cronbach's alpha. The optimal cut-off point was determined by calculating Receiver Operating Curves, using semi-structured clinical interviews as standard in a random subsample of 99 respondents. Subsequently, predictive value, likelihood ratio, and interrater agreement were calculated. The factor structure of the SRQ- 20 was determined through exploratory factor analysis. Factorial invariance over time was tested in a multigroup confirmatory factor analysis. Results: The reliability of the SRQ- 20 in women (= 0. 85) and men (= 0. 81) could be considered good. The instrument performed moderately well in detecting common mental disorders, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0. 76 for women and 0. 74 for <b>men.</b> <b>Cut-off</b> scores were different for women (10) and men (8). Factor analysis yielded five factors, explaining 38 % of the total variance. The factor structure proved to be time invariant. Conclusions: The SRQ- 20 {{can be used as a}} screener to detect mental disorder in a Rwandan community setting, but cut-off scores need to be adjusted for women and men separately. The instrument also shows longitudinal factorial invariance, which is an important prerequisite for assessing changes in symptom severity. This is a significant finding as in non-western post-conflict settings the relevance of diagnostic categories is questionable. The use of the SRQ- 20 can be considered an alternative option for measuring the effect of a psychosocial intervention on mental health. Trial registration. Nederlands Trial Register NTR 1120...|$|R
40|$|Sarcopenia {{is defined}} by a loss of muscle mass and {{strength}} with aging. Many factors {{have been reported to}} intervene in this process including physical activity, nutritional status, hormonal status and higher levels of serum inflammatory markers. The main consequences of sarcopenia are limitations of physical performance in older people which increases the risk of falls, fractures, hospitalizations, dependency and mortality. The prevalence of sarcopenia varies widely between studies especially in people older than 80 years (range 10 - 50 %). This large variability results from the different criteria that are used in these studies to define Sarcopenia. Recently, the International Working Group on Sarcopenia suggested that firstly the presence of sarcopenia should be evaluated in all patients with observed declines in physical functional, strength or health status. Secondly, the diagnosis of sarcopenia should be based on gait speed and muscle mass (12). However, {{it has been suggested that}} in subjects aged 80 years and older, muscle strength and physical performance capacity may be more relevant indicators of sarcopenia than the muscle mass index (15, 16, 21). The aim of this thesis is to investigate Sarcopenia in very old persons throughout following questions: ”What is the prevalence in community-dwelling very older persons in Belgium?”, “What is the relationship between muscle mass, muscle strength, inflammatory markers and physical performance?”, “What are the predictive values of muscles strength and physical performance for all-cause mortality, hospitalization and the onset of disability, independent of muscle mass, inflammation and comorbidity?” and “What are relevant cut-off points of grip strength and physical performance to detect a clinically significant risk in this population?”. Our results showed that 12. 5 % of the participants in the study were regarded as sarcopenic, according to the European consensus. The strong discrepancy between the prevalence of low muscle mass and the prevalence of low grip strength or poor physical performance was confirmed in our study. The prevalence of sarcopenia according to single criteria was estimated for men and woman respectively to be 14. 6 and 12. 4 % according to skeletal muscle index, 49. 5 and 59. 5 % according to grip strength criterion, 44. 7 and 70. 8 % according to Short physical performance battery (SPPB) and 81. 6 and 96. 2 % according to gait speed. In addition, this study showed that the European consensus does not provide much additional value to determine the prevalence of sarcopenia compared to the use of a single measurement of muscle mass. This study showed that the grip strength is associated with low physical performance in very old people and support the hypothesis that low physical performance levels are associated with low grip strength levels rather than with low muscle mass. Low physical performance was only associated with low grip strength in both sexes and in women with age and comorbidities. No association with inflammatory markers was observed. In people aged 80 and over, physical performance is a strong predictor of mortality, hospitalization and disability. Muscle strength, on the other hand, is as a strong predictor of mortality and hospitalization. Moreover, all these relationships were independent of muscle mass, inflammatory markers and comorbidity. The current study could not find a significant association between the activities of daily living scale decline and muscle strength. In contrast physical performance showed a significant relationship with activities of daily living scale decline, even after adjusting for potential confounders. Cut-off values to identify an early risk of poor mobility or an onset of disability were estimated for women as 20. 3 kg for grip strength and 8 for SPPB and for men as 31. 5 kg for grip strength and 8 for SPPB. Cut-off values 20. 4 kg for grip strength and 4 for SPPB test have been identified as a strong predictor of mortality in very older women. For <b>men,</b> <b>cut-off</b> values of 26. 5 for grip strength and 6 for SPPB were identified as a strong predictor of mortality. Moreover, all these relationships were independent of muscle mass, the activities of daily living capacity, the 15 -item Geriatric Depression Scale, the cognitive status and comorbidities. In conclusion, ours results shown that use of easily available tools in clinical practice like grip strength and physical performance test are good risk predictors; better than the muscle mass to predict adverse outcomes such as mortality and hospitalization in subjects aged 80 and older. A new approach diagnosis of sarcopenia could be developed based on muscle strength and function and adapted for very old persons in community-dwelling and clinical practice. In addition, our findings confirmed that the current cut-off values permit to predict a risk of poor mobility in community-dwelling population. (MED - Sciences médicales) [...] UCL, il...|$|R
