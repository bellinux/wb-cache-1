5000|$|Women had expert {{knowledge}} of how to [...] "de-toxify" [...] certain plant foods. The seeds of the <b>cycad</b> <b>palm,</b> Cycas media, are highly carcinogenic when raw, and require elaborate treatment including shelling, crushing, leaching in running water for up to five days, then cooking. After this they are made into small loaves, which can keep for a number of weeks.|$|R
50|$|The 2,500 {{species of}} the <b>palm</b> <b>family,</b> Arecaceae, are {{typically}} found in tropic and subtropic regions.

In addition to <b>palms,</b> <b>cycads,</b> and orchids, visitors will find banana (Musa), Bird of Paradise (Strelitzia), Anthurium and ginger (Zingiberaceae) in this house.|$|R
50|$|The seed-like kernels of the <b>cycad</b> <b>palm</b> were {{eaten by}} {{aboriginal}} Australians {{because of the}} seed's high starch content. The seeds ripened during the dry season, when other foods consumed by native hunter-gatherers were scarce. A large grove represented a huge natural food source, and would be exploited by several native band groups. In its natural state the seed is highly toxic to mammals. The Australians recognized this danger, and responded by two methods. They removed the toxins by leaching with water for {{three to five days}} and then baking the starch; or they allowed the kernels to ferment before cooking and eating them. Note that the kernels contain carcinogens, and are not recommended for human consumption, even prepared through traditional methods.|$|R
