25|$|When {{used for}} cabin pressurization, the bleed {{air from the}} engine must first be cooled (as it exits the {{compressor}} stage at temperatures as high as 250°C) by passing it through an air-to-air heat exchanger cooled by <b>cold</b> <b>outside</b> air. It is then fed to an air cycle machine unit that regulates the temperature and flow of air into the cabin, keeping the environment comfortable.|$|E
25|$|Also, as {{the heat}} pump takes heat {{out of the}} air, some {{moisture}} in the outdoor air may condense and possibly freeze on the outdoor heat exchanger. The system must periodically melt this ice; this defrosting translates into an additional energy (electricity) expenditure. When it is extremely <b>cold</b> <b>outside,</b> it is simpler to heat using an alternative heat source (such as an electric resistance heater, oil furnace, or gas furnace) rather than to run an air-source heat pump. Also, avoiding {{the use of the}} heat pump during extremely cold weather translates into less wear on the machine's compressor.|$|E
25|$|Alternative {{scenarios}} {{have been}} put forth as more accurate and realistic representations of the moral issues present in abortion. John Noonan proposes the scenario of a family who {{was found to be}} liable for frostbite finger loss suffered by a dinner guest whom they refused to allow to stay overnight, although it was very <b>cold</b> <b>outside</b> and the guest showed signs of being sick. It is argued that just as it would not be permissible to refuse temporary accommodation for the guest to protect him from physical harm, it would not be permissible to refuse temporary accommodation of a fetus.|$|E

25|$|Conspiring {{with his}} mentor Gilliam and second-in-command Edgar, Curtis Everett plans {{to lead the}} tail {{passengers}} in a revolt that will take {{them all the way}} up to the engine. Mason and armed guards come to take two small children, Andy and Timmy. Andy's father Andrew attempts to fight back, but is punished by Mason by being forced to put his arm into the extreme <b>cold</b> <b>outside</b> the train, effectively amputating it. Enraged, Curtis initiates their plan the next time they are to be fed, taking the security and prison cars. Curtis releases security expert Namgoong Minsu and his clairvoyant daughter Yona from the prison car so he can disable the locks between cars, offering them a hallucinogenic drug called Kronole as payment. They take the car where insects are ground up to make their protein bars, and Gilliam suggests that if they take the subsequent water supply car, they will control any negotiation with Wilford. Instead, they are ambushed by a mass of masked men with hatchets led by Franco the Elder under Mason's orders; after a bloody battle Curtis sacrifices Edgar to win the fight. Mason is taken captive and Curtis, Namgoong, Yona, Tanya, Andrew and Gilliam's bodyguard Grey continue on with her as a hostage.|$|E

2500|$|In 1938, Nash Motors {{developed}} the first automobile heater warmed by hot engine cooling water, and using fresh air. This [...] "Conditioned Air System" [...] {{is characterized by}} a cowl-mounted outside air receiver that passes fresh air through a heater core utilizing hot engine coolant for a heat source. The Nash system also pioneered the use of slight pressurization within the passenger compartment to eliminate the infiltration of <b>cold</b> <b>outside</b> air during winter use. This was a fan-boosted filtered ventilation and heating for the passengers, not the modern meaning of an [...] "air conditioning" [...] system. Nash was also the first automobile to make use of a disposable filter in the air-intake to clean incoming air.|$|E

50|$|During cold, dry seasons, the mucus lining nasal {{passages}} {{tends to}} dry out, meaning that mucous membranes must work harder, producing more mucus {{to keep the}} cavity lined. As a result, the nasal cavity can fill up with mucus. At the same time, when air is exhaled, water vapor in breath condenses as the warm air meets the <b>colder</b> <b>outside</b> temperature near the nostrils. This causes an excess amount of water to build up inside nasal cavities. In these cases, the excess fluid usually spills out externally through the nostrils.|$|R
5000|$|The tunnel {{company had}} a curious {{secondary}} business, namely air conditioning, which {{was accomplished by}} selling naturally cool tunnel air to theaters above the tunnels. [...] The McVickers, Rialto and four other theaters owned by the same company used tunnel air. Tunnel air was also utilized in the winter, as heating this air required less energy than heating the often much <b>colder</b> <b>outside</b> air. They estimated that they used less than one-third the coal they would have used without the tunnel connection. [...] The tunnel air was a constant 55 F year round.|$|R

2500|$|A chimney damper is a {{metal plate}} {{that can be}} {{positioned}} to close off the chimney {{when not in use}} and prevent outside air from entering the interior space, and can be opened to permit hot gases to exhaust when a fire is burning. [...] A top damper or cap damper is a metal spring door placed {{at the top of the}} chimney with a long metal chain that allows one to open and close the damper from the fireplace. [...] A throat damper is a metal plate at the base of the chimney, just above the firebox, that can be opened and closed by a lever, gear, or chain to seal off the fireplace from the chimney. [...] The advantage of a top damper is the tight weatherproof seal that it provides when closed, which prevents <b>cold</b> <b>outside</b> air from flowing down the chimney and into the living space—a feature that can rarely be matched by the metal-on-metal seal afforded by a throat damper. [...] Additionally, because the throat damper is subjected to intense heat from the fire directly below, it is common for the metal to become warped over time, thus further degrading the ability of the throat damper to seal. [...] However, the advantage of a throat damper is that it seals off the living space from the air mass in the chimney, which, especially for chimneys positioned on an outside of wall of the home, is generally very cold. [...] It is possible in practice to use both a top damper and a throat damper to obtain the benefits of both. [...] The two top damper designs currently on the market are the Lyemance (pivoting door) and the Lock Top (translating door).|$|E

50|$|In regions {{without any}} high {{temperature}} geothermal resources, a ground-source heat pump (GSHP) can provide space heating and space cooling. Like a refrigerator or air conditioner, these systems use a heat pump {{to force the}} transfer of heat from the ground to the building. Heat can be extracted from any source, no matter how cold, but a warmer source allows higher efficiency. A ground-source heat pump uses the shallow ground or ground water (typically starting at 10 - 12 C) {{as a source of}} heat, thus taking advantage of its seasonally moderate temperatures. In contrast, an air-source heat pump draws heat from the air (<b>colder</b> <b>outside</b> air) and thus requires more energy.|$|R

40|$|Insulation is an {{important}} component of building energy efficiency (Table 2). If not selected or installed properly, it may not be effective at retarding heat flow. Insulation is a material that slows the transfer of heat. Heat always travels from hot to cold. So, in the summertime, insulation serves as a barrier to retard the hot, outside conditions from entering the cooler, inside conditions of a home or building. In the wintertime, it retards the flow of warmth inside a building from transferring to the <b>colder</b> <b>outside</b> conditions. As most readers will recall, heat is transferred by three methods: conduction, radiation and convection. Radiant barriers such as aluminum foil retard radiant heat flow, while infiltration and moisture barriers retard convective heat transfer. A combination of these may b...|$|R
