60|$|When {{the noise}} of pursuit ceased Duane {{sat down in the}} darkness, his mind <b>clamped</b> <b>between</b> two things--whether to try again to escape or wait for {{possible}} opportunity. He seemed incapable of decision. His intelligence told him that every hour lessened his chances for escape. He had little enough chance in any case, and that was what made another attempt so desperately hard. Still it was not love of life that bound him. There would come an hour, sooner or later, when he would wrench decision out of this chaos of emotion and thought. But that time was not yet. He had remained quiet long enough to cool off and recover from his run he found that he was tired. He stretched out to rest. But the swarms of vicious mosquitoes prevented sleep. This corner of the brake was low and near the river, a breeding-ground for the blood-suckers. They sang and hummed and whined around him in an ever-increasing horde. He covered his head and hands with his coat and lay there patiently. That was a long and wretched night. Morning found him still strong physically, but in a dreadful state of mind.|$|E

25|$|In the Byzantine period, domes were {{normally}} hemispherical and had, {{with occasional}} exceptions, windowed drums. All {{of the surviving}} examples in Constantinople are ribbed or pumpkin domes, with the divisions corresponding {{to the number of}} windows. Roofing for domes ranged from simple ceramic tile to more expensive, more durable, and more form-fitting lead sheeting. Metal <b>clamps</b> <b>between</b> stone cornice blocks, metal tie rods, and metal chains were also used to stabilize domed construction. The technique of using double shells for domes, although revived in the Renaissance, originated in Byzantine practice.|$|R
5000|$|The DNA clamp fold is an α+β {{protein that}} assembles into a multimeric {{structure}} that completely encircles the DNA double helix as the polymerase adds nucleotides {{to the growing}} strand. The DNA clamp assembles on the DNA at the replication fork and [...] "slides" [...] along the DNA with the advancing polymerase, aided by a layer of water molecules in the central pore of the <b>clamp</b> <b>between</b> the DNA and the protein surface. Because of the toroidal shape of the assembled multimer, the clamp cannot dissociate from the template strand without also dissociating into monomers.|$|R
40|$|Sometime between 30 {{seconds and}} 2 minutes after {{delivery}} {{appears to be}} the best interval. In term infants, delayed clamping (waiting 1 or 2 minutes or until the cord stops pulsating) improves hemoglobin and ferritin levels, but slightly increases the risk of neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy (strength of recommendation [SOR]: A, meta-analysis). In preterm infants less than 37 weeks of age, cord <b>clamping</b> <b>between</b> 30 and 120 seconds after delivery reduces the need for blood transfusion (number needed to treat [NNT]= 4) and frequency of intraventricular hemorrhage (NNT= 8) compared with clamping in less than 20 seconds (SOR: A, meta-analyses) ...|$|R

2500|$|A Cochrane {{review in}} 2013 {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that delayed cord <b>clamping</b> (<b>between</b> one and three minutes after birth) is [...] "likely to be beneficial as long as access to treatment for jaundice requiring phototherapy is available". In this review delayed clamping, as contrasted to early, resulted in no difference in risk of severe maternal postpartum hemorrhage or neonatal mortality, low Apgar score. On the other hand, delayed clamping resulted in an increased birth weight of on average about 100 g, and an increased hemoglobin concentration of on average 1.5 g/dL with half the risk of being iron deficient at three and six months, but an increased risk of jaundice requiring phototherapy.|$|R

40|$|Objectives—To {{determine}} whether eVective refractory period (ERP) shortens or lengthens {{in the first}} minutes of ischaemia in humans, and the relation between ERP changes and action potential duration (APD). Methods—ERP and monophasic action potential duration (MAPD) were measured from a sin-gle left ventricular epicardial site in 26 patients undergoing coronary artery surgery. Cardiopul-monary bypass was instituted and normothermia maintained. Refractory period {{was determined by the}} extrastimulus technique at a basic cycle length of 500 ms, at four times (group 1, 15 patients) or two times (group 2, 11 patients) the preischaemic diastolic threshold. A three minute period of ischaemia was instituted by aortic cross <b>clamping</b> <b>between</b> the input from the pump oxygenator and the heart. Results—After three minutes of ischaemia, mean (SEM) ERP lengthened from 232 (5) m...|$|R
5|$|The domes {{and drums}} {{typically}} incorporated wooden tension rings at several levels to resist deformation in the mortar {{and allow for}} faster construction. Metal <b>clamps</b> <b>between</b> stone cornice blocks, metal tie rods, and metal chains were also used to stabilize domed buildings. Timber belts at the bases of domes helped to stabilize the walls below them during earthquakes, but the domes themselves remained vulnerable to collapse. The surviving ribbed or pumpkin dome examples in Constantinople are structurally equivalent and those techniques were used interchangeably, {{with the number of}} divisions corresponding to the number of windows. Aided by the small scale of churches after the 6th century, such ribbed domes could be built with formwork only for the ribs. Pumpkin domes could have been built in self-supporting rings and small domical vaults were effectively corbelled, dispensing with formwork altogether.|$|R
5000|$|China - about 500 AD the jia xie {{method for}} dyeing (usually silk) using wood blocks was invented. An upper {{and a lower}} block is made, with carved out {{compartments}} opening to the back, fitted with plugs. The cloth, usually folded a number of times, is inserted and <b>clamped</b> <b>between</b> the two blocks. By unplugging the different compartments and filling them with dyes of different colours, a multi-coloured pattern can be printed over quite a large area of folded cloth.|$|E

5000|$|The basic {{shape of}} the heaters is a disk with each side an {{extremely}} shallow cone. The essential structure consists of two large discs of pressed steel <b>clamped</b> <b>between</b> chrome-plated grilles. This simple and lightweight construction made the units easily portable. The heater is mounted on slim triangular chrome-plated legs, and has white handles to either side made from stay-cool compression-moulded urea-formaldehyde plastic. The internal components can be easily accessed by {{the removal of the}} four set-screws underneath the handles, after which the top grille and back panel simply lift off.|$|E

50|$|In addition, jia xie is {{a method}} for dyeing {{textiles}} (usually silk) using wood blocks invented in the 5th-6th centuries in China. An upper and a lower block is made, with carved out compartments opening to the back, fitted with plugs. The cloth, usually folded a number of times, is inserted and <b>clamped</b> <b>between</b> the two blocks. By unplugging the different compartments and filling them with dyes of different colours, a multi-coloured pattern can be printed over quite a large area of folded cloth. The method is not strictly printing however, as the pattern is not caused by pressure against the block.|$|E
5000|$|Assembly of a screw {{connection}} requires some care in workmanship to ensure proper removal of insulation, containment of all wire strands, and the adequate tightening of the screw. If the wire diameter is small {{in relation to}} the size of the screw, the wire may be cut through by the over-tightening of the screw. This is less likely to occur when a wire is <b>clamped</b> <b>between</b> two plates by the action of a screw. Since wire strands may not be contained by the screw head in a basic screw terminal, stranded wires may be crimped into a ferrule to prevent the bridging of terminals; this partly offsets the economy of a [...] "bare" [...] wire termination.|$|E

Stimpy refuses because George is his [...] "kind and beloved master", but Ren, who is sick of George Liquor and their treatment, picks up an oar and maniacally begins beating him up with it, much to Stimpy's horror. Again, Ren expects George to be enraged. Instead, he is {{impressed}} and calls him a champion and produces cigar-shaped treats for all of them.

40|$|Topological {{defects in}} ordered states with spontaneously broken {{symmetry}} often have unusual physical properties, such as fractional electric charge or a quantised magnetic field-flux, originating from their non-trivial topology. Coupled topological defects in systems with several coexisting orders {{give rise to}} unconventional functionalities, such as the electric-field control of magnetisation in multiferroics resulting from the coupling between the ferroelectric and ferromagnetic domain walls. Hexagonal manganites provide an extra degree of freedom: In these materials, both ferroelectricity and magnetism are coupled to an additional, non-ferroelectric structural order parameter. Here we present a theoretical study of topological defects in hexagonal manganites based on Landau theory with parameters determined from first-principles calculations. We explain the observed flip of electric polarisation at the boundaries of structural domains, {{the origin of the}} observed discrete vortices, and the <b>clamping</b> <b>between</b> ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic domain walls. We show that structural vortices induce magnetic ones and that, consistent with a recent experimental report, ferroelectric domain walls can carry a magnetic moment.

50|$|A {{standard}} beadlock {{is designed}} to clamp the tire bead between an outer and an inner ring. The inner ring may be welded onto a standard wheel increasing wheel width by anywhere from 1½ to 2 inches or may be formed {{as part of the}} wheel when the wheel is made in the factory. The outer ring is then bolted onto the inner ring with the bead <b>clamped</b> <b>between</b> them. Anywhere between 16 and 32 bolts at around 10 ft·lbf are used around the circumference of the wheel to keep the clamp tight. The rings and bolts can cause problems with balancing the wheel and tire because all the added weight is on one side. This style is used exclusively for offroad use.|$|E
50|$|The {{aluminum}} disk was twenty-two {{inches in}} diameter and was faced with an aluminum disk of equal size with a facing of just {{over a quarter of}} an inch in thickness. The traversing wheel was eighteen {{inches in diameter}} with a 1.5 in working face, strawboard rings eighteen inches outside diameter by three inches radial dimension. It was <b>clamped</b> <b>between</b> cast iron members supporting the strawboard rings inside and clamping them sideways. This fibrous friction wheel is splined to slide on a sleeve seventeen inches in diameter variably carried on a steel shaft thirteen inches in diameter. It journaled in swinging boxes so that the wheel can be pressed against or separated from the iron, aluminum-faced driving disk, which is motor driven.|$|E
