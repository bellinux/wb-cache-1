5|$|The Council {{passed an}} Act on February 26, 1877, which was {{subsequently}} given Royal Assent.

5|$|Marasmius funalis {{mushrooms}} leave a white spore print. The individual basidiospores are ellipsoidal, {{and measure}} 6.5 to 8 by 4 to 5micrometres (μm). They have thin cell walls, {{and they are}} smooth and colourless. The spores are inamyloid, meaning {{that they do not}} stain when they <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> iodine from Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The spores are borne on club-shaped basidia measuring 20 to 25 by 4.5 to 7μm, with two spores per basidium. There are also club-shaped basidioles (under-developed basidia).|$|E
5|$|Most ground-living cacti {{have only}} fine roots, which spread {{out around the}} base of the plant for varying distances, close to the surface. Some cacti have taproots; in genera such as Copiapoa, these are {{considerably}} larger and of a greater volume than the body. Taproots may aid in stabilizing the larger columnar cacti. Climbing, creeping and epiphytic cacti may have only adventitious roots, produced along the stems where these <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> a rooting medium.|$|E

5|$|The major way {{bacteria}} {{defend themselves}} from bacteriophages is by producing enzymes that destroy foreign DNA. These enzymes, called restriction endonucleases, cut up the viral DNA that bacteriophages inject into bacterial cells. Bacteria also contain {{a system that}} uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of viruses that the bacteria have <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> in the past, which allows them to block the virus's replication through a form of RNA interference. This genetic system provides bacteria with acquired immunity to infection.|$|E
5|$|Allergic symptoms, {{including}} rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma, {{have been}} documented in laboratory animal workers who <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> guinea pigs. Allergic reactions following direct exposure to guinea pigs in domestic settings have also been reported. Two major guinea pig allergens, Cav p I and Cav p II, {{have been identified in}} guinea pig fluids (urine and saliva) and guinea pig dander. People who are allergic to guinea pigs are usually allergic to hamsters and gerbils, as well. Allergy shots can successfully treat an allergy to guinea pigs, although treatment can take up to 18 months.|$|E
5|$|Before being {{exported}} {{from the}} district, all furs {{had to pass}} through depots manned by a quarantine officer appointed by the Board of Health. Any furs believed to have <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> parts of the district infected by smallpox were to be destroyed. This led to some problems for the Government of Canada after the Council was dissolved. Some people whose furs had been destroyed under these regulations applied to the Government for compensation, as no mechanism {{was put in place}} when the Act was drafted. These claims for compensation were considered, but ultimately ignored.|$|E

5|$|Distant {{regions of}} space {{are assumed to}} exist and {{to be part of}} reality as much as we are, even though we can never {{interact}} with them. The spatial region that we can affect and be affected by is the observable universe. The observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling, an observer can <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> a greater region of spacetime than an observer who remains still. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler {{will not be able to}} interact with all of space. Typically, the observable universe is taken to mean the portion of the Universe that is observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{obstacles}} had to {{be overcome}} in the handling of both fluorine and UF6. Before the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant could be built, it was first necessary to develop non-reactive chemical compounds {{that could be used}} as coatings, lubricants and gaskets for the surfaces which would <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the UF6 gas (a highly reactive and corrosive substance). William T. Miller, professor of organic chemistry at Cornell University, was co-opted to develop such materials, because of his expertise in organofluorine chemistry. Miller and his team developed several novel non-reactive chlorofluorocarbon polymers that were used in this application.|$|E
5|$|Social wasps are {{considered}} pests {{when they become}} excessively common, or nest close to buildings. People are most often stung in late summer, when wasp colonies stop breeding new workers; the existing workers search for sugary foods {{and are more likely}} to <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> humans; if people then respond aggressively, the wasps sting. Wasp nests made in or near houses, such as in roof spaces, can present a danger as the wasps may sting if people come close to them. Stings are usually painful rather than dangerous, but in rare cases, people may suffer life-threatening anaphylactic shock.|$|E

The former soldier Lightning begins her fight against the government in order to save her sister who has been branded as an unwilling servant to a god-like being from Pulse, making her an enemy of Cocoon. Lightning is soon joined by a band of allies, and together the group also become marked by the same Pulse creature. They rally against the Sanctum while trying to discover their assigned task and whether they can avoid being turned into monsters or crystals at the completion.|$|E
5|$|The hybrid {{program has}} been criticized, with one of Sulimov's colleagues {{pointing}} out that in other tests the Laika performed {{just as well as}} the jackal hybrids. The assumption that dogs have lost some of their scent-detection ability may be incorrect, in that dogs {{need to be able to}} scent-detect and identify the many humans that they <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> in their domesticated environment. Another researcher crossed German Shepherds with wolves and claimed that this hybrid had superior scent-detection abilities. The scientific evidence to support the claims of hybrid researchers is minimal, and more research has been called for.|$|E
5|$|When B {{was first}} founded, the linear {{magnetic}} eddy brake {{had yet to}} be developed, so it used friction brakes as its main braking system. On the train, pads are fitted beneath the seating areas. On the brakes, similar pads are connected to steel supports. When the pads on the train <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the brakes, friction is created which slows the train. Beginning with Kumba in 1993, friction brakes have also been used as trim brakes that regulate the speed of the train while it is still navigating the course.|$|E
