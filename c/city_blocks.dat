5|$|ILM {{digitally}} recreated {{the vast}} majority of the New York cityscape used in the film. In total, ILM artists rendered an area of about ten <b>city</b> <b>blocks</b> by about four <b>city</b> <b>blocks.</b> To do this, ILM sent out a team of four photographers to take pictures of the area in a shoot that lasted 8 weeks. Disney and Sony Pictures agreed for OsCorp Tower from The Amazing Spider-Man to be included in the film, but the idea was dropped because much of the skyline had already been completed.|$|E

5|$|Before 1950, Gulfton {{consisted}} of farm land {{and much of}} the area belonged to Westmoreland Farms. In the mid-1950s, the Shenandoah subdivision was established; consisting of sixteen <b>city</b> <b>blocks</b> of ranch-style homes. Shenandoah was located adjacent to the land which would later become the site of the Gulfton apartment complexes. Decades later these communities would clash as the apartments surrounding Shenandoah deteriorated and property values became threatened.|$|E
5|$|Crime in Washington, D.C., is {{concentrated}} in areas associated with poverty, drug abuse, and gangs. A 2010 study found that 5% of <b>city</b> <b>blocks</b> accounted for over one-quarter of the District's total crime. The more affluent neighborhoods of Northwest Washington are typically safe, but reports of violent crime increase in poorer neighborhoods generally concentrated in the eastern portion of the city. Approximately 60,000 residents are ex-convicts.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, as part {{of urban}} renewal, the city razed about 200 {{buildings}} across 25 <b>city</b> <b>blocks</b> (roughly 40% of downtown), destroying the Gateway District and many buildings with notable architecture, including the Metropolitan Building. Efforts to save the building failed but are credited with sparking interest in (but not always succeeding in) historic preservation in the state.|$|E

5|$|In November 1883, the Oregon and California Railroad {{was built}} {{through the center}} of the Rogue Valley, {{bypassing}} Jacksonville, the county seat. The railroad company also constructed a train depot halfway between Central Point and Phoenix, and platted 82 <b>city</b> <b>blocks</b> around it. The townsite was named Medford in December. In 1884, residents celebrated the town's first Independence Day by firing 38 cannon blasts—one for each U.S. state—from Roxy Ann Peak's summit. Medford grew quickly, and was incorporated on February 24, 1885.|$|E
5|$|Social {{tensions}} were {{exacerbated by}} {{the revival of the}} Ku Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 <b>city</b> <b>blocks</b> destroyed, $1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.|$|E

5|$|Capitol Hill {{had been}} {{proposed}} {{as the site}} of a subway stop in unimplemented plans from 1911 and 1968, but voter approval did not come until 1996. It was built as part of the University Link Extension, which began construction in 2009 and opened on March 19, 2016. Construction of the station required the demolition of two <b>city</b> <b>blocks</b> along Broadway, which will be redeveloped into a transit-oriented, mixed-use complex in 2019. Light rail trains serve the station 20 hours a day on most days; the headway between trains is 6 minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times. The station is also served by the First Hill Streetcar and several King County Metro bus routes at nearby stops.|$|E
5|$|Once US12 intersects {{the eastern}} end of its {{business}} loop, it returns to Michigan Avenue for the remainder of its routing in the state. The roadway is a boulevard in this area, a street divided by a central median. It runs through Canton Township and parallel to the Lower River Rouge. US12 intersects I-275 on {{the eastern side of the}} township before crossing into Wayne. The highway is bounded by a mix of industrial and commercial properties in suburban Metro Detroit. In downtown Wayne, the two sides of Michigan Avenue split apart, surrounding the central business district of the city and separated by two to three <b>city</b> <b>blocks.</b> East of this split, Michigan Avenue crosses a section of Westland before entering Inkster.|$|E
5|$|Past NY281, NY222 crosses a {{commercial}} section of Cortlandville, passing several strip malls prior to entering {{the city of}} Cortland. Now named Groton Avenue, the route slowly curves eastward while traversing a residential part of the city. It passes north of the State University of New York at Cortland, and the campus marks {{the western edge of}} downtown Cortland. NY222 becomes {{a commercial}}ized street again, serving a pair of <b>city</b> <b>blocks</b> before intersecting with US 11 and NY41 (Main Street). US 11 and NY 41 join NY222, and the concurrency between the three routes heads east through downtown as Clinton Avenue. The overlap lasts for just one block, however, as NY222 ends upon intersecting NY13 at the next junction. NY13 northbound continues east along Clinton Avenue while NY13 southbound heads south along Church Street on an overlap with US11 and NY41.|$|E
