40|$|Abstract Background Caenorhabditis elegans {{actively}} crawls down {{thermal gradients}} {{until it reaches}} the temperature of its prior cultivation, exhibiting what is called <b>cryophilic</b> movement. Implicit in the worm's performance of <b>cryophilic</b> movement {{is the ability to}} detect thermal gradients, and implicit in regulating the performance of <b>cryophilic</b> movement is the ability to compare the current temperature of its surroundings with a stored memory of its cultivation temperature. Several lines of evidence link the AFD sensory neuron to thermotactic behavior, but its precise role is unclear. A current model contends that AFD is part of a thermophilic mechanism for biasing the worm's movement up gradients that counterbalances the <b>cryophilic</b> mechanism for biasing its movement down gradients. Results We used tightly-focused femtosecond laser pulses to dissect the AFD neuronal cell bodies and the AFD sensory dendrites in C. elegans to investigate their contribution to <b>cryophilic</b> movement. We establish that femtosecond laser ablation can exhibit submicrometer precision, severing individual sensory dendrites without causing collateral damage. We show that severing the dendrites of sensory neurons in young adult worms permanently abolishes their sensory contribution without functional regeneration. We show that the AFD neuron regulates a mechanism for generating <b>cryophilic</b> bias, but we find no evidence that AFD laser surgery reduces a putative ability to generate thermophilic bias. In addition, although disruption of the AIY interneuron causes worms to exhibit <b>cryophilic</b> bias at all temperatures, we find no evidence that laser killing the AIZ interneuron causes thermophilic bias at any temperature. Conclusion We conclude that laser surgical analysis of the neural circuit for thermotaxis does not support a model in which AFD opposes <b>cryophilic</b> bias by generating thermophilic bias. Our data supports a model in which the AFD neuron gates a mechanism for generating <b>cryophilic</b> bias. </p...|$|E

40|$|Temperature {{responses}} of nitrate reductase (NR) were {{studied in the}} psychrophilic unicellular alga, Koliella antarctica, and in the mesophilic species, Chlorella sorokiniana. Enzymes from both species were purified to near homogeneity by Blue Sepharose (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) affinity chromatography and high-resolution anionexchange chromatography (MonoQ; Pharmacia; Uppsala, Sweden). Both enzymes have a subunit molecular mass of 100 kDa, and K. antarctica NR has a native molecular mass of 367 kDa. NR from K. antarctica used both NADPH and NADH, whereas NR from C. sorokiniana used NADH only. Both NRs used reduced methyl viologen (MVH) or benzyl viologen (BVH). In crude extracts, maximal NADH and MVH-dependent activities of <b>cryophilic</b> NR were found at 15 and 35 °C, respectively, and retained 77 and 62 % of maximal activity, respectively, at 10 °C. Maximal NADH and MVH-dependent activities of mesophilic NR, however, were found at 25 and 45 °C, respectively, with only 33 and 23 % of maximal activities being retained at 10 °C. In presence of 2 m M flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), activities of <b>cryophilic</b> NADH:NR and mesophilic NADH:NR were stable up to 25 and 35 °C, respectively. Arrhenius plots constructed with <b>cryophilic</b> and mesophilic MVH:NR rate constants, in both {{presence or absence of}} FAD, showed break points at 15 and 25 °C, respectively. Essentially, similar results were obtained for purified enzymes and for activities measured in crude extracts. Factors by which the rate increases by raising temperature 10 °C (Q 10) and apparent activation energy (Ea) values for NADH and MVH activities measured in enzyme preparations without added FAD differed slightly from those measured with FAD. Overall thermal features of the NADH and MVH activities of the <b>cryophilic</b> NR, including optimal temperatures, heat inactivation (with/without added FAD) and break-point temperature in Arrhenius plots, are all shifted by about 10 °C towards lower temperatures than those of the mesophilic enzyme.

40|$|We study four citrate synthase homodimeric {{proteins}} {{within a}} structure-based coarse-grained model. Two of these proteins come from thermophilic bacteria, {{one from a}} <b>cryophilic</b> bacterium and one from a mesophilic organism; three are in the closed and two in the open conformations. Even though the proteins {{belong to the same}} fold, the model distinguishes the properties of these proteins in a way which is consistent with experiments. For instance, the thermophilic proteins are more stable thermodynamically than their mesophilic and <b>cryophilic</b> homologues, which we observe both in the magnitude of thermal fluctuations near the native state and in the kinetics of thermal unfolding. The level of stability correlates with the average coordination number for amino acids contacts and with the degree of structural compactness. The pattern of positional fluctuations along the sequence in the closed conformation is different than in the open conformation, including within the active site. The modes of correlated and anticorrelated movements of pairs of amino acids forming the active site are very different in the open and closed conformations.

The expression patterns of subsets of these genes were further verified in vivo. Genes identified by this analysis encode 7 -transmembrane receptors, kinases, and nuclear factors including dac- 1, which encodes a homolog of the highly conserved Dachshund protein [1]. dac- 1 is expressed in a subset of sensory neurons including the AFD neurons and is regulated by the TTX- 1 OTX homeodomain protein [2]. On thermal gradients, dac- 1 mutants fail to suppress a <b>cryophilic</b> drive but continue to track isotherms at the cultivation temperature, representing the first genetic separation of these AFD-mediated behaviors. Expression profiling of single neuron types provides a rapid, powerful, and unbiased method for identifying neuron-specific genes whose functions can then be investigated in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Background: Plant {{recruitment}} depends {{among other}} factors on environmental conditions and their variation at different spatial scales. Characterizing dispersal in contrasting environments may thus {{be necessary to}} understand natural intraspecific variation in the processes underlying recruitment. Silene ciliata and Armeria caespitosa are two representative species of <b>cryophilic</b> pastures above the tree line in Mediterranean high mountains. No explicit estimations of dispersal kernels have been made so far for these or other high-mountain plants. Such data could help to predict their dispersal and recruitment patterns {{in a context of}} changing environments under ongoing global warming. Methods: We used an inverse modelling approach to analyse effective seed dispersal patterns in five populations of both Silene ciliata and Armeria caespitosa along an altitudinal gradient in Sierra de Guadarrama (Madrid, Spain). We considered four commonly employed two-dimensional seedling dispersal kernels exponential-power, 2 Dt, WALD and log-normal. Key Results: No single kernel function provided the best fit across all populations, although estimated mean dispersal distances were short (, 1 m) in all cases. S. ciliata did not exhibit significant among-population variation in mean dispersal distance, whereas significant differences in mean dispersal distance were found in A. caespitosa. Both S. ciliata and A. caespitosa exhibited among-population variation in the fecundity parameter and lacked significant variation in kernel shape. Conclusions: This study illustrates the complexity of intraspecific variation in the processes underlying recruitment, showin...|$|E
40|$|For {{several years}} it has been of {{interest}} to astrobiologists to focus on Earth’s glaciers as a habitat that can be similar to glaciers on other moons and planets. Microorganisms on glaciers form consortia – cryoconite granules (cryoconites). They are granular/spherical mineral particles connected with archaea, cyanobacteria, heterotrophic bacteria, algae, fungi, and micro animals (mainly Tardigrada and Rotifera). <b>Cryophilic</b> organisms inhabiting glaciers have been studied in different aspects: from taxonomy, ecology and biogeography, to searching of biotechnological potentials and physiological strategies to survive in extreme glacial habitats. However, {{they have never been}} used in astrobiological experiments. The main aim of this paper is brief review of literature and supporting assumptions that cryoconite granules and microinvertebrates on glaciers, are promising models in astrobiology for looking for analogies and survival strategies in terms of icy planets and moons. So far, astrobiological research have been conducted on single strains of prokaryotes or microinvertebrates but never on a consortium of them. Due to the hypothetical similarity of glaciers on the Earth to those on other planets these cryoconites consortia of microorganisms and glacier microinvertebrates may be applied in astrobiological experiments instead of the limno-terrestrial ones used currently. Those consortia and animals have qualities to use them in such studies and they may be the key to understanding how organisms are able to survive, reproduce and remain active at low temperatures...|$|E
