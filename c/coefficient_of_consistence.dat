Literature review has been conducted in the research and experimentation scale has been prepared first by taking expert opinions. In the experiment scale there have been 33 articles which compose 3 negative and 30 positive statements. 214 girls and 186 boys (in total 400) who are between the age of 11 and 18 at Gülen Muharrem Pakoğlu Middle School and Bahçelievler Deneme Anatolium High School located in Çankaya province in Ankara compose the sample of the study. As a result of the Attitude Scale’s explanatory factor analysis against art which has been developed as part of the study, 4 factors explaining % 52. 410 of the total variance have been obtained and 12 articles have been removed from the scale. A four-factor structure has been tested by confirmatory factor analysis and the tested model has been seen to have good compliance index. In order to determine the reliability of the scale, Cronbach's Alpha internal <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>consistence</b> has been examined and item analysis has been conducted.

The theoretical section of the thesis summarizes the existing findings {{in regard to the}} theory and research of magical thinking. The empirical section is dedicated to the development and subsequent validation of the new testing method devised to measure inclinations to magical thinking. Proving the method's validity is firstly aimed at gathering convergent proofs based on the relations towards methods measuring similar constructs, the external criterion being the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale (RPBS) and the subscale of Esoteric and Personal Superstitious Thinking of the Contrastive Thinking Inventory (CTI). The second part of the research focuses on the validity proofs gathered in relation to the categorical variable - group affiliation - where we test a selective collection of the general public against a selection of technical and natural scientists and a selection of people attending courses with esoteric content. The research results confirm the method's reliability based on the split-half method and they also confirm a high <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> inner <b>consistence</b> <b>of</b> Cronbach's alpha.

The dependence of these critical angles on the bed depth is also analytically formulated, reflecting the expected qualitative behavior.

SCC is a thick suspension, and its rheology can be characterized by Bingham model, in terms of yield shear stress (τy) and plastic viscosity (μ). The main objective {{of this study is}} to explore variation <b>of</b> <b>consistence</b> <b>of</b> the mortar fraction, in terms of τy, when high-range water-reducing admixtures (HRWR), fly-ash and river sand are present in mortar. As SCC is a suspension of coarse aggregates in mortar, the research focuses on τy of grout and mortar. In this study, τy of pastes that contain different quantities of HRWR, fly-ash and sand was measured. Combined effects of the constituents on τy were observed for two common w/c ratios using concentric rheometer and mini slump cone with the view to determine the optimum compositions. Results suggest to maintain HRWR and fly-ash contents around 1. 0 L/ 100 kg, and 25 %- 30 % by mass of cement, respectively, and sand content below 40 % by the total volume of the mix. Moreover, the study validates an analytical model derived to evaluate τy by using slump spread diameter and also develops and empirical formula linking τy to the slump spread diameter of cement paste. The findings pave way to use mini slump test as simple tool to judge the adequacy <b>of</b> the <b>consistence</b> <b>of</b> mortar and grout in proportioning of SCC, minimizing the repetitive trials...|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The catheter (1) under test is pulled through a gel-like soft viscous elastic substance (2). The (frictional) force required {{to pull the}} catheter is measured. The viscous elastic substance is subjected to a defined pressure so that a defined surface normal force is exerted upon the catheter surface. By subjecting the substance to be measured to a predetermined, defined pressure, surface pressures on each surface element of the catheter surface are precisely determined and maintained constant. By applying a constant pressure on the surface, the total normal force can be kept constant and the friction coefficient determined for the diameter and <b>consistence</b> <b>of</b> each catheter.

Its principle is to design mortar, deducted from concrete composition, for which the rheological properties display correlation with those of concrete.
