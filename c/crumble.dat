5|$|Apples are an {{important}} ingredient in many desserts, such as apple pie, apple <b>crumble,</b> apple crisp and apple cake. They are often eaten baked or stewed, and {{they can also be}} dried and eaten or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid) for later use. When cooked, some apple cultivars easily form a puree known as apple sauce. Apples are also made into apple butter and apple jelly. They are also used (cooked) in meat dishes.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea {{travelled}} to White Hart Lane to face Tottenham Hotspur in {{the sixth}} round. The team finished the tie as comfortable 4–0 winners, never looking as though they would <b>crumble</b> once William Gallas scored inside 12 minutes. The one negative from their performance was the dismissal of Graeme Le Saux for a second bookable offence in the second half. Local rivals Fulham were Chelsea's semi-final opponents. A scrappy match, which saw Fulham dominate much of the play but creating little, was settled in Chelsea's favour. Terry scored just before half time, heading the ball through the legs of Louis Saha standing in Fulham's goal.|$|E

The north resisted through the Serbian Despotate, which had Belgrade as its capital. The city flourished under Stefan Lazarević, son of Serbian prince Lazar Hrebeljanović. Lazarević built a castle with a citadel and towers, of which only the Despot's tower and west wall remain. He also refortified the city's ancient walls, allowing the Despotate {{to resist the}} Ottomans for almost 70 years.

40|$|Problem statement: Soil {{fragmentation}} is {{a primary}} aim in tillage {{in order to create}} a favorable soil environment for crop growth. Soil fragmentation is defined as the process of breakdown and <b>crumbling</b> of soil aggregates. Currently, there is no published research data on optimum tillage operations for seedbed preparation in loamy-clay soils of western Caspian Sea region of Iran. Approach: Tests were conducted on a loamy-clay soil near the city of Ardabil, Iran, to investigate the effects of different tillage operations on soil <b>crumbling.</b> Four tillage treatments: Moldboard plow (M) (conventional method), Moldboard plow and Disk-Harrow (MH), Decompactor and Moldboard plow (DM) and De-Compactor and Disk-Harrow (DH) were used in this study with four replications. The tillage depth for all treatments was about 30 cm. Following tillage operations, intensive soil samples were taken from the top 25 cm of soil at 5 cm depth increments and were analyzed for aggregate size and distribution using 9 standard sieves (0. 25 - 19 mm mesh). Analysis of variance was carried out regarding soil <b>crumbling</b> percentage and mean diameter of soil aggregates in each treatment. The experiment was arranged in a split-plot design with five levels of soil sampling depths and two main factors (tillage method and tillage depth) which were arranged in Latin Square design. Results: Results showed that the tillage treatments had a significant effect on soil <b>crumbling.</b> Also, soil <b>crumbling</b> varied with soil depth and the optimum particle sizes were developed at the 5 - 20 cm soil depth. There was a non-linear correlation between soil <b>crumbling</b> percentage and tillage depth. Conclusion/Recommendations: Tillage methods and soil sampling depth had interaction effect on soil <b>crumbling</b> percentage. The MH treatment had the greatest amount of soil <b>crumbling</b> and the best seed-bed condition...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the effect of feed processing (pelleting) on bodyweight, feed conversion and mortality in male broilers. Pelleted feed was compared to mash feed with the same specification. In addition, the effect of feed texture (feed particle size) on bodyweight, feed conversion and mortality, by using <b>crumbles</b> and pellets, ground <b>crumbles</b> and pellets, and mash was evaluated. Six thousand day-old Ross 788 male broiler chickens, originating from a specific broiler breeder flock (37 weeks old) were divided into three treatment groups of 2000 birds by systematic random sampling. The experiment was an 8 x 3 block design, with 250 broilers randomly and equally assigned to each pen. The birds were kept in a controlled environmental house and vaccinated against NCD, IB, IBD and Pneumovirus. The experiment {{was carried out}} at 1517 m above sea level, on the Highveld of South Africa. At this altitude and together {{with the fact that}} the experiment was carried out during winter (June and July 1997), no inducing methods were necessary. Mortalities were recorded daily and post mortems were done on all dead chickens and the cause of death recorded. Dead chickens were weighed individually and the weight recorded. Bacteriology was done on all the chickens that died from infectious causes to identify the specific bacteria. The bodyweight per pen was determined by weighing all the chickens per pen on day 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 and weighing at least 20 % of the chickens per pen on day 4, 11, 18, 25, 32 and 39. The feed conversion and mortality corrected feed conversion were determined on day 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42. The mean live mass in kg, the percentage survivors, the feed conversion and age in days were used to calculate the production efficiency factor for each treatment group at 42 days of age. Chickens on <b>crumbles</b> and pellets had the highest bodyweight (2304, 0 g) at 42 days of age. They were followed by the chickens on the mash diet (2054, 1 g) and the lowest bodyweight was recorded on the ground <b>crumbles</b> and pellets (1993, 5 g). The difference in bodyweight for the three treatment groups was significant (p# 0, 05). The pelleting process therefore did not result in better bodyweight, but the bodyweight were determined by the particle size of the feed (feed texture). The percentage weight gain per week, decreased from week one to week six. During the first week and to a lesser extent during the second week, there was a big difference in percentage weight gain between treatment groups. The chickens on the <b>crumbles</b> and pellets grew the fastest (230, 1 % during week one and 159 % during week two). The weight gain for the chickens on the all-mash diet was 187, 7 % for week one and 153, 1 % for week two. The slowest weight gain was in the chickens on the ground <b>crumbles</b> and pellets (179, 7 % during week one and 143, 5 % during week two). The weekly weight gain in the three treatment groups from week three to week six was similar. The difference in weight gain over the first two weeks, was probably due to the difference in feed texture, because the chickens on the <b>crumbles</b> grew the fastest and the chickens on the ground <b>crumbles</b> the slowest. Eleven percent of the <b>crumbles</b> and 5 % of the pellets were smaller than 0, 6 mm. In the mash 25, 0 % and in the ground <b>crumbles</b> and pellets 41, 5 % of the particles were smaller than 0, 6 mm. In the <b>crumbles</b> 44 % and in the pellets 76, 7 % particles were greater than 3, 6 mm. In the mash 7, 5 % and in the ground <b>crumbles</b> and pellets 3, 5 % of the particles were greater than 3, 6 mm. The best FC (1, 900) and mortality corrected FC (1, 852) were achieved on <b>crumbles</b> and pellets. It differed significantly (p# 0, 05) from the FC (1, 946) and mortality corrected FC (1, 921) of chickens on ground <b>crumbles</b> and pellets, as well as the FC (1, 963) and mortality corrected FC (1, 945) of chickens on mash. There was no significant (p> 0, 05) difference in the FC and mortality corrected FC in the ground <b>crumbles</b> and pellets, and mash rations. The pelleting process on its own, did not significantly improve feed efficiency. Grinding of <b>crumbles</b> and pellets abolished the feed efficiency responses observed when the physical form was preserved. Particle size (feed texture) was therefore the most important factor determining feed efficiency. Mortality was the highest in chickens on <b>crumbles</b> and pellets (6, 57 %), followed by 4, 03 % in chickens on ground <b>crumbles</b> and pellets and 2, 85 % in chickens on mash. These differences in mortality were significant (p# 0, 05). The higher mortality on <b>crumbles</b> and pellets was mainly caused by ascites (2, 11 %) and SDS (1, 39 %), which caused 3, 5 % of the mortality. The most important cause of mortality in the group receiving ground <b>crumbles</b> and pellets was SDS (1, 01 %). Although the total mortality in the chickens on <b>crumbles</b> and pellets was the highest, the better bodyweight and FC in this group resulted in the highest PEF (269, 8) at 42 days. The chickens on mash had a PEF of 242, 4 and in the chickens on ground <b>crumbles</b> and pellets it was 233, 6. The better results on <b>crumbles</b> and pellets are further accentuated by the net return per 2000 day-old chickens placed of R 1694. 70 when compared to the chickens on ground <b>crumbles</b> and pellets, and R 1196. 36 when compared to the chickens on mash. This study therefore, showed that particle size (feed texture), played the most important role in determining bodyweight and feed efficiency in broilers. To ensure the heaviest bodyweight and most efficient feed conversion on any given feed specification, it is of utmost importance that broilers receive feed as intact <b>crumbles</b> and pellets, with minimum damage to the <b>crumbles</b> and pellets.

5|$|With {{material}} from previous articles, Weisman uses {{the fate of}} the Mayan civilization to illustrate the possibility of an entrenched society vanishing and how the natural environment quickly conceals evidence. To demonstrate how vegetation could compromise human built infrastructure, Weisman interviewed hydrologists and employees at the Panama Canal, where constant maintenance is required to keep the jungle vegetation and silt away from the dams. To illustrate abandoned cities succumbing to nature, Weisman reports from Chernobyl, Ukraine (abandoned in 1986) and Varosha, Cyprus (abandoned in 1974). Weisman finds that their structures <b>crumble</b> as weather does unrepaired damage and other life forms create new habitats. In Turkey, Weisman contrasts the construction practices of the rapidly growing Istanbul, as typical for large cities in less developed countries, with the underground cities in Cappadocia. Due to a large demand for housing in Istanbul much of it was developed quickly with whatever material was available and could collapse in a major earthquake or other natural disaster. Cappadocian underground cities were built thousands of years ago out of volcanic tuff, and are likely to survive for centuries to come.|$|E
5|$|After Emperor Mingzong died in 933, the Later Tang {{began to}} <b>crumble</b> {{from its own}} {{succession}} crisis. Mingzong's son and successor Li Conghou ruled for only five months {{before he was killed}} in 934 in a coup led by his adoptive brother Li Congke (Emperor Mo of Later Tang). Prince Bei, who was still an honored guest at the Tang court at the time, wrote to his brother Emperor Taizong (Yelü Deguang), advising him to invade the Tang. Instead, Taizong lent military support to a rebellion led by Shi Jingtang, a Tang governor and son-in-law of the former Emperor Mingzong. With Khitan help, in 936 Shi Jingtang succeeded in replacing the Later Tang with his own Later Jin. After some negotiation with the more powerful Khitans, he ceded sixteen border prefectures stretching from modern-day Datong (Shanxi province) to the coast of the Bohai Sea east of what is now Beijing, to the Liao. Since the Sixteen Prefectures contained numerous strategic passes and fortifications, the Khitans now had unrestricted access to the plains of northern China. Shi Jingtang also agreed to treat Emperor Taizong of Liao as his own father, a move that symbolically elevated Taizong and the Liao to a superior position.|$|E
