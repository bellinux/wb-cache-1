5|$|In 2005, Nokia {{released}} a Python interpreter for the Series 60 mobile phones named PyS60. It includes {{many of the}} modules from the CPython implementations and some additional modules to integrate with the Symbian operating system. This project has been {{kept up to date}} to run on all variants of the S60 platform and there are several third party modules available. The Nokia N900 also supports Python with GTK widget libraries, with the feature that programs <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>both</b> written and run on the target device.|$|E
5|$|The {{software}} {{can be purchased}} in any of five capability configurations: JMP, JMP Pro, JMP Clinical, JMP Genomics and the JMP Graph Builder App for the iPad. JMP can be automated with its proprietary scripting language, JSL. The software is focused on exploratory visual analytics, where users investigate and explore data. These explorations can also be verified by hypothesis testing, data mining, or other analytic methods. In addition, discoveries made through graphical exploration can inspire a designed experiment that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>both</b> designed and analyzed with JMP.|$|E

5|$|As they progress, players gain {{experience}} points through defeating {{enemies and}} completing quests for non-player characters (NPCs) scattered around environments: these raise a character's experience level, which grant access to fresh skills and points {{that can be}} used to upgrade character attributes such as health and energy levels, dexterity, intelligence, or strength. If the player dies, they respawn at rebirth fountains scattered through the world, although they lose some accumulated experience points. Quests are divided into Main Quests related to the central narrative, and side quests unique to particular areas of the world. Other NPCs can be found in towns and cities that act as Merchants selling equipment and items: these <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>both</b> bought and sold. Player characters have multiple equipment slots, which can take armor for limbs and torso, weapons or shields, and accessories that grant passive boons.|$|E
5|$|Most Tales {{games have}} skits, side conversations between {{different}} characters that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>both</b> dramatic and comedic in nature. They are commonly portrayed as character portraits or profiles, with text {{along the bottom}} of the screen. They were first introduced in Tales of Destiny, though the majority were cut from the English release. In the original English GameCube release of Symphonia, the voice track for the skits was removed, but for its HD re-release, the Japanese voice track, and consequently the skit voice tracks, were included. The first English release to include fully voiced skits was Vesperia: they had been planned for Abyss, but were cut due to space issues. Another recurring feature is the Cooking system, where characters learn and prepare dishes to restore health and forms of experience points.|$|E
5|$|Organisms vary {{in their}} ability to take up foreign dsRNA and use it in the RNAi pathway. The effects of RNA {{interference}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>both</b> systemic and heritable in plants and C. elegans, although not in Drosophila or mammals. In plants, RNAi is thought to propagate by the transfer of siRNAs between cells through plasmodesmata (channels in the cell walls that enable communication and transport). Heritability comes from methylation of promoters targeted by RNAi; the new methylation pattern is copied in each new generation of the cell. A broad general distinction between plants and animals lies in the targeting of endogenously produced miRNAs; in plants, miRNAs are usually perfectly or nearly perfectly complementary to their target genes and induce direct mRNA cleavage by RISC, while animals' miRNAs tend to be more divergent in sequence and induce translational repression. This translational effect may be produced by inhibiting the interactions of translation initiation factors with the messenger RNA's polyadenine tail.|$|E

5|$|Some {{populations of}} cattle egrets are migratory, others are dispersive, and {{distinguishing}} {{between the two}} can be difficult for this species. In many areas populations <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>both</b> sedentary and migratory. In the northern hemisphere, migration is from cooler climes to warmer areas, but cattle egrets nesting in Australia migrate to cooler Tasmania and New Zealand {{in the winter and}} return in the spring. Migration in western Africa is in response to rainfall, and in South America migrating birds travel south of their breeding range in the non-breeding season. Populations in southern India appear to show local migrations in response to the monsoons. They move north from Kerala after September. During winter, many birds have been seen flying at night with flocks of Indian pond herons (Ardeola grayii) on the south-eastern coast of India and a winter influx has also been noted in Sri Lanka.|$|E
5|$|The {{temperament}} of the West Highland White Terrier {{can vary}} greatly, with some being friendly towards children, whilst others prefer solitude. It {{will not tolerate}} rough handling such as a child pulling on its ears, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>both</b> food- and toy-possessive. It is normally independent, assured, and self-confident, and can make a good watchdog. It is a loyal breed that bonds with its owner, but is often always on the move, requiring good exercise (15–30 min). The Westie is highly social and is the most friendly and jolly of all the Scottish breeds of terriers.|$|E
5|$|Ultra-stripped supernovae {{occur when}} the {{exploding}} star has been stripped (almost) {{all the way to}} the metal core, via mass transfer in a close binary. As a result, very little material is ejected from the exploding star (~0.1 MSun). In the most extreme cases, ultra-stripped supernovae can occur in naked metal cores, barely above the Chandrasekhar mass limit. SN 2005ek might be an observational example of an ultra-stripped supernova, giving rise to a relatively dim and fast decaying light curve. The nature of ultra-stripped supernovae <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>both</b> iron core-collapse and electron capture supernovae, depending on the mass of the collapsing core.|$|E

5|$|In battle, {{players can}} perform {{multiple}} actions: walking or running along a fixed axis, freely {{running around the}} battlefield, jumping in any direction, guarding against attacks, and pausing the battle to select a different enemy to attack. Characters can launch various attacks, from standard strikes to strikes that can interrupt enemy attacks. The player character's attacks can be chained together to create combo attacks, which create a continual flow of attacks without giving the enemy a chance to attack. Continual strikes activate the change for a Fatal Strike, which kills normal enemies and heavily damages bosses. Landing successive Fatal Strikes grants bonuses {{at the end of}} the battle. During battle, landing successive strikes without taking hits fill an Over Limit meter. Once the meter is full, the player character can perform continual attacks and cast Artes without casting time during the Over Limit's duration. During battles, Secret Mission can be triggered by performing unspecified actions. Completing Secret Missions grants a bonus to the battle grade or acquire an item. All characters can use Artes, special physical and magical abilities which can range from standard attacks to healing magic. Learned by leveling up a character, Artes <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>both</b> specifically directed and have a general area of effect. Four Artes can be assigned to each character, and each Arte can be assigned to a hot key. Some Artes can be used outside battle to cure characters. In addition to standard Artes, each character can access Mystic Arts, extra-powerful cinematic attacks.|$|E
5|$|In the Oligocene, from twenty-five to thirty-two {{million years}} ago, {{there was another}} {{significant}} restructuring of the global carbon cycle as grasses evolved a new mechanism of photosynthesis, C4 photosynthesis, and expanded their ranges. This new pathway evolved {{in response to the}} drop in atmospheric CO2 concentrations below 550 ppm. The relative abundance and distribution of biodiversity alters the dynamics between organisms and their environment such that ecosystems <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>both</b> cause and effect in relation to climate change. Human-driven modifications to the planet's ecosystems (e.g., disturbance, biodiversity loss, agriculture) contributes to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas levels. Transformation of the global carbon cycle in the next century is projected to raise planetary temperatures, lead to more extreme fluctuations in weather, alter species distributions, and increase extinction rates. The effect of global warming is already being registered in melting glaciers, melting mountain ice caps, and rising sea levels. Consequently, species distributions are changing along waterfronts and in continental areas where migration patterns and breeding grounds are tracking the prevailing shifts in climate. Large sections of permafrost are also melting to create a new mosaic of flooded areas having increased rates of soil decomposition activity that raises methane (CH4) emissions. There is concern over increases in atmospheric methane {{in the context of the}} global carbon cycle, because methane is a greenhouse gas that is 23 times more effective at absorbing long-wave radiation than CO2 on a 100-year time scale. Hence, there is a relationship between global warming, decomposition and respiration in soils and wetlands producing significant climate feedbacks and globally altered biogeochemical cycles.|$|E
