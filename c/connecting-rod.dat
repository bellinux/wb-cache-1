The concept was much improved by the Italian Roberto Valturio in 1463, who devised a boat with five sets, where the parallel cranks are all joined to a single power source by one <b>connecting-rod,</b> an idea also taken up by his compatriot Francesco di Giorgio.|$|E

The effect laws of the structural parameters on the Plant-arm’s locus were obtained through analyzing the Plant-arm’s locus, which got by changing the groove cam’s horizontal offset angle ranging from 0 ° to 20 °, the sum of <b>Connecting-rod’s</b> length ranging from 130 mm to 150 mm, and the subtract of <b>Connecting-rod’s</b> length ranging from 15 mm to 25 mm.

6000|$|The Northern weather so far {{shows no}} sign of improvement. From all {{quarters}} come complaints of the unusual prevalence of sleet at the higher levels. Racing planes and digs alike have suffered severely--the former from 'unequal deposits of half-frozen slush on their vans (and only those who have [...] "held up" [...] a badly balanced plane in a cross-wind know what that means), and the latter from loaded bows and snow-cased bodies. As a consequence, the Northern and North-western upper levels have been practically abandoned, and the high fliers have returned to the ignoble security of the Three, Five, and Six hundred foot levels. But there remain a few undaunted sun-hunters who, in spite of frozen stays and ice-jammed <b>connecting-rods,</b> still haunt the blue empyrean.|$|R
50|$|The crank and {{connecting}} rod mechanism which converts circular into reciprocal motion {{is of utmost}} importance for the mechanization of work processes; it is first attested for Roman water-powered sawmills. During the Renaissance, its use is greatly diversified and mechanically refined; now <b>connecting-rods</b> are also applied to double compound cranks, while the flywheel is employed to get these cranks over the 'dead-spot'. Early evidence of such machines appears, among other things, {{in the works of}} the 15th-century engineers Anonymous of the Hussite Wars and Taccola. From then on, cranks {{and connecting}} rods {{become an integral part of}} machine design and are applied in ever more elaborate ways: Agostino Ramelli's The Diverse and Artifactitious Machines of 1588 depicts eighteen different applications, a number which rises in the 17th-century Theatrum Machinarum Novum by Georg Andreas Böckler to forty-five.|$|R

50|$|The {{controlled}} combustion engines, {{designed by}} Bradley Howell-Smith of Australian firm Revetec Holdings Pty Ltd, use opposed pairs of pistons {{to drive a}} pair of counter-rotating three-lobed ("trilobate") cams through bearings. These elements replace the conventional crankshaft and <b>connecting-rods,</b> which enables {{the motion of the}} pistons to be purely axial, so that most of the power otherwise wasted on lateral motion of the con-rods is effectively transferred to the output shaft. This gives six strokes per revolution of the shaft. Independent tests reproducibly measure the efficiency of these engines at figures approaching 40%. Any even number of pistons can be used, in boxer or X configurations; the three lobes of the cams can be replaced by any other odd number greater than one; and the geometry of the cams can be changed to suit the needs of the target fuels and applications of the engines. Such variants may have ten or more strokes per cycle.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1820s, Foster, Rastrick and Company {{produced}} steam locomotives {{intended for}} two railways: one in the USA and one {{just a few miles from}} the works at Stourbridge. The local opportunity had arisen after an agreement between James Foster and Francis Downing, the mineral agent of John William Ward, the 4th Viscount Dudley and Ward. The parties agreed to build a three-mile railway linking coal mines in the Shut End area with a purpose-built canal basin at Ashwood on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal. In America, at about the same time, the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company were developing a rail and canal link between coal mines at Carbondale and the Hudson River. The Foster, Rastrick and Company built only four steam locomotives (each one having vertical cylinders, placed at the back and each side of the furnace, with grasshopper beams and <b>connecting-rods</b> from them to the crankpins in the four coupled wheels). Three were sent to America and one to the Kingswinford Railway in the Black Country.|$|R
5000|$|The car was {{developed}} by Opel alongside the Manta B 400 model which consisted of the same changes. Irmscher and Cosworth were hired as partners for the project, Cosworth to deliver a 16 valve double cam crossflow head for the engine, and Irmscher for the exterior and interior styling. Cosworth delivered the heads to Opel and Opel soon discovered a major mistake. The plan was to use the 2.0 litre engine block but this did not produce enough power. Time was running out and Opel badly needed to do something. Opel took the 2.0E block and gave it an overbore, installed larger pistons, different <b>connecting-rods,</b> and installed the crankshaft of their 2.3 litre diesel CIH style engine. The result was a 2.4 litre engine. The 2.4 litre engine gave rise to some massive power outputs using the 16 valve head. The street versions of the 400 therefore came with [...] engines, using the Bosch fuel injection of the Manta GSi and GT/E series. However, in race trim they were delivered putting out , which could be improved further to , while still using normally aspirated engine components.|$|R

60|$|What {{follows is}} worth consideration. The forward engine {{had no more}} work to do. Its {{released}} piston-rod, therefore, drove up fiercely, with nothing to check it, and started most of the nuts of the cylinder-cover. It came down again, {{the full weight of}} the steam behind it, and the foot of the disconnected <b>connecting-rod,</b> useless as the leg of a man with a sprained ankle, flung out to the right and struck the starboard, or right-hand, cast-iron supporting-column of the forward engine, cracking it clean through about six inches above the base, and wedging the upper portion outwards three inches towards the ship's side. There the <b>connecting-rod</b> jammed. Meantime, the after-engine, being as yet unembarrassed, went on with its work, and in so doing brought round at its next revolution the crank of the forward engine, which smote the already jammed <b>connecting-rod,</b> bending it and therewith the piston-rod cross-head- the big cross-piece that slides up and down so smoothly.|$|E
60|$|The {{noise was}} released, the little {{locomotive}} with her clanking steel <b>connecting-rod</b> emerged on the highroad, clanking sharply.

60|$|They {{had kept}} the hardest work to the last, as boys save Latin prose, and, worn though they were, Mr. Wardrop did not dare to give them rest.

They fell to it, cheered by a little chalk showing of work done and time consumed which Mr. Wardrop wrote up on the engine-room bulkhead. Fifteen days had gone--fifteen days of killing labour--and there was hope before them.|$|E
