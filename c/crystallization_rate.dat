50|$|Hot melt glues usually {{consist of}} one base {{material}} with various additives. The composition is usually formulated {{to have a}} glass transition temperature (onset of brittleness) below the lowest service temperature and a suitably high melt temperature as well. The degree of crystallization should {{be as high as}} possible but within limits of allowed shrinkage. The melt viscosity and the <b>crystallization</b> <b>rate</b> (and corresponding open time) can be tailored for the application. Faster <b>crystallization</b> <b>rate</b> usually implies higher bond strength. To reach the properties of semicrystalline polymers, amorphous polymers would require molecular weights too high and, therefore, unreasonably high melt viscosity; the use of amorphous polymers in hot melt adhesives is usually only as modifiers. Some polymers can form hydrogen bonds between their chains, forming pseudo-cross-links which strengthen the polymer.|$|E

5000|$|He {{discovered}} the Czochralski method in 1916, when he accidentally dipped his pen into a crucible of molten tin {{rather than his}} inkwell. He immediately pulled his pen out to discover that a thin thread of solidified metal was hanging from the nib. The nib {{was replaced by a}} capillary, and Czochralski verified that the crystallized metal was a single crystal. Czochralski's experiments produced single crystals a millimeter in diameter and up to 150 centimeters long. He published a paper on his discovery in 1918 in the Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie, a German chemistry journal, under the title [...] "Ein neues Verfahren zur Messung der Kristallisationsgeschwindigkeit der Metalle" [...] new method for the measurement of the <b>crystallization</b> <b>rate</b> of metals, since the method was at that time used for measuring the <b>crystallization</b> <b>rate</b> of metals such as tin, zinc and lead.

50|$|The melting {{temperature}} of PLLA {{can be increased}} by 40-50 °C and its heat deflection temperature can be increased from approximately 60 °C to up to 190 °C by physically blending the polymer with PDLA (poly-D-lactide). PDLA and PLLA form a highly regular stereocomplex with increased crystallinity. The temperature stability is maximised when a 1:1 blend is used, but even at lower concentrations of 3-10% of PDLA, {{there is still a}} substantial improvement. In the latter case, PDLA acts as a nucleating agent, thereby increasing the <b>crystallization</b> <b>rate.</b> Biodegradation of PDLA is slower than for PLA due to the higher crystallinity of PDLA.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} bovine {{carbonic}} anhydrase (CA) on calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) crystallization was investigated. A new method {{was developed to}} estimate the biocatalytic activity of CA in alkaline solution. The CA was immobilized within polyurethane (PU) foam, and compared its biocatalytic activity with the free-CA and bare-PU foam. A minireactor was created in a calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2) solution {{in order to control}} the CO 2 transfer rate, and reproducible results were obtained. It was found that the free-CA lost its activity in less than 6 min at pH 12. 5 in alkaline Ca(OH) 2 solution. The CaCO 3 <b>crystallization</b> <b>rates</b> for the immobilized-CA were found to be a U-shape, relatively lower at lower immobilized-CA amounts compared to those for the free-CA and bare-PU foam and higher when the amount of immobilized-CA increased.

40|$|The Central Volcanic Complex / (CVC-I) {{consists}} {{mainly of}} mildly alkaline basalts, {{many of them}} ankaramitic. The compositional differences observed are explained by fractionation and extraction (rates between 20 % and 30 %) of dinopyroxene (60 %), olivine (20 - 25 %) and titanomagnetite. The CVC-ll shows two different stages. The lower one of mildly alkaline affinity has an age comprised between 20 and 22 Ma, the more alkalic upper one has a more recent age about 18 Ma. The crystallization models for the lower stage are different depending on the composition {{considered to be the}} most primary or less differentiated magma. The <b>crystallization</b> <b>rates</b> are comprised between 20 and 30 %. the compositional variation observed in the basalts from the upper stage maybe due to <b>crystallization</b> <b>rates</b> from 20 - 25 %, mainly olivine (50 - 70 %) and dinopyroxene.

40|$|The {{presence}} of carbon fibers increased the <b>crystallization</b> <b>rates</b> of both PEEK and PPS thermoplastic polymers. The effect was most pronounced at higher crystallization temperatures. Isothermal <b>crystallization</b> <b>rates</b> {{were analyzed by}} applying classical phenomenological nucleation theory. Unusually high values of the so-called Avrami exponent were found for neat PEEK. Isothermal crystallization of PEEK and PPS polymers produced crystalline samples having {{a wide variety of}} melting temperatures. The melting as observed by differential scanning calorimetry occurred as dual endotherms which were called primary (higher temperature) and secondary melting peaks. Each primary peak accounted for most of the crystallinity present. The secondary peaks represented the melting of crystallites formed later than those attributable to the primary endotherms. The {{presence of}} carbon fibers increased the thermal stability of both PEEK and PPS crystallites as manifested by higher temperatures for the primary melting peaks. This may be attributable to increased crystallite size, greater crystallite perfection, and/or favorable modification of the crystallite interface.

50|$|If a {{microscopic}} droplet {{of water is}} cooled very fast, it forms {{what is called a}} glass (low-density amorphous ice) in which all the tetrahedrons of water molecules are not lined up, but amorphous. The change in structure of water controls the rate at which ice forms. Depending on its temperature and pressure, water ice has 16 different crystalline forms in which water molecules cling to each other with hydrogen bonds. When you cool down water, its structure becomes closer to the structure of ice, which is why the density goes down, and this should be reflected in an increased <b>crystallization</b> <b>rate</b> showing these crystalline forms.|$|E
5000|$|Polyesters, {{similar to}} the ones used for {{synthetic}} fibers. High application temperature. Synthetized from a diol and a dicarboxylic acid. The length of the diol chain has major influence to the material's properties; with increasing diol chain length the melting point increases, the <b>crystallization</b> <b>rate</b> increases, and the degree of crystallization decreases. Both the diol and acid influence the melting point. In comparison with similar polyamides, due to absence of hydrogen bonds, polyesters have lower strength and melting point, but are much more resistant to moisture, though still susceptible. In other parameters, and in applications where these factors do not play a role, polyesters and polyamides are very similar. Polyesters are often used for bonding fabrics. They can be used on their own, or blended with large amounts of additives. They are used where high tensile strength and high temperature resistance are needed. Most polyester hot melt adhesives have high degree of crystallinity. Niche applications, together with polyamides taking less than 10% of total volume of hot melt adhesives market. Water-dispersible amorphous polymers, modified by addition of sodium sulfonate groups for dispersability, were however developed for repulpable adhesives. Polyesters are often highly crystalline, leading to narrow melting temperature range, which is advantageous for high-speed bonding.|$|E

Results show that nucleation densities of both spherulites and shish-kebabs strongly affect <b>crystallization</b> <b>rate</b> as well as morphology.

40|$|Melting and nonisothermal {{crystallization}} {{behaviors of}} polypropylene (PP) and PP/hemp fibers (HFs) composites was investigated by {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) technique. The {{results show that the}} incorporation of HFs increases both the melting temperature (Tm) and crystallization temperature (Tc) of PP. Moreover, in comparison with PP/HF(70 / 30) composite, the addition of maleic anhydride-grafted PP (PP-MAH) results in a slight decrease in Tm but a significant increase in Tc of PP. The higher Tc of PP in the composites implies that HFs could act as nucleating agents for the crystallization of PP. Nonisothermal crystallization kinetics analysis was performed using Avrami and Mo models. The values of half-time (t 1 / 2) and rate constant indicate that the <b>crystallization</b> <b>rate</b> increases with the increasing of cooling rate for all the specimens. However, the <b>crystallization</b> <b>rate</b> of PP/HF(70 / 30) composite is found to be lower than that of PP at a certain cooling rate.
