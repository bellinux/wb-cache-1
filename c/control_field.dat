25|$|The University of Illinois {{conducted}} {{studies to}} measure the effect of warmer temperatures on soybean plant growth and Japanese beetle populations. Warmer temperatures and elevated CO2 levels were simulated for one field of soybeans, while the other was left as a control. These studies found that the soybeans with elevated CO2 levels grew much faster and had higher yields, but attracted Japanese beetles at a significantly higher rate than the <b>control</b> <b>field.</b> The beetles in the field with increased CO2 also laid more eggs on the soybean plants and had longer lifespans, indicating {{the possibility of a}} rapidly expanding population. DeLucia projected that if the project were to continue, the field with elevated CO2 levels would eventually show lower yields than that of the <b>control</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{increased}} CO2 levels deactivated three genes {{within the}} soybean plant that normally create chemical defenses against pest insects. One of these defenses is a protein that blocks digestion of the soy leaves in insects. Since this gene was deactivated, the beetles {{were able to}} digest a much higher amount of plant matter than the beetles in the <b>control</b> <b>field.</b> This led to the observed longer lifespans and higher egg-laying rates in the experimental field.|$|E
