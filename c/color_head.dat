50|$|Dedicated color {{enlargers}} typically {{contain an}} adjustable filter mechanism - the <b>color</b> <b>head</b> - between the light source and the negative, enabling {{the user to}} adjust the amount of red, green and blue light reaching the negative to control color balance. Other models have a drawer where cut filters can be inserted into the light path, synthesize colour by additive mixing of light from colored lamps with adjustable intensity or duty cycle, or expose the receiving medium sequentially using red, green and blue light. These enlargers {{can also be used}} with variable-contrast monochrome papers.|$|E

Prothorax is narrowed forward, obtusely dentate at the basal angle. Elytra show two weak longitudinal ribs. In males the antennae reach the extremity of the body, while in the females they are a little shorter than the body. The abdomen is glabrous, with a protruding oviduct.|$|E
50|$|This breed {{comprises}} numerous breed types. They {{differ in}} size, <b>color,</b> <b>head</b> types, and hair types. Central Asians tend {{to form a}} social group, consisting of different members bearing different duties; thus puppies with different working qualities are normally born in the same litter. These breed features, as well as different traditional names for the breed, give grounds for complications with breed standard. Most important, purebred Central Asians have unique breed characteristics. Breed-specific dog anatomy includes exclusive features, such as very noticeable extremely flexible joints, false ribs, specific head set, and very strong neck with massive dewlap. Expressive, almost human eyes, revealing inimitable intelligence, finish the portrait.|$|E
5000|$|Wingspan {{is about}} 52-58 in male and 54-68 in female. Antennae of male with {{bristles}} and cilia. Fore and hind tibia sometimes spined. Male is grey speckled with brown <b>color.</b> <b>Head</b> dark colored. Fore wings with curved and waved antemedial, medial and postmedial lines. Stigma sometimes well developed, usually reduced to spots or obsolete. A pale straight sub-marginal line found runs to both wings. Female much paler and greyer. Specimens found from Myanmar has the lilacine greyish ground color, where the female grey and vinous red suffused. Sri Lankan male form is purplish with a reddish tinge and some yellow on postmedial line of fore wings.|$|E
5000|$|Males become highly {{territorial}} during breeding season. They discourage intruding males by brightening {{their red}} heads and doing [...] "push-ups". Each tries {{to attract a}} female by inflating his throat and drawing attention to his handsomely <b>colored</b> <b>head.</b> Oviparous; about 10—20 eggs are laid, buried in moist soil. The eggs are long, spindle-shaped {{and covered with a}} leathery skin. They hatch in about 6-7 weeks. They are able to breed at about 1 year old.|$|R

6000|$|... § 18. But {{even those}} hosts who choose well will be farther {{distinguished}} {{from each other}} by their choice of nobler or inferior companies; and we find the greatest artists mainly divided into two groups,--those who paint principally with respect to local <b>color,</b> <b>headed</b> by Paul Veronese, Titian, and Turner; and those who paint principally with reference to light and shade irrespective of <b>color,</b> <b>headed</b> by Leonardo da Vinci, Rembrandt, and Raphael. The noblest members {{of each of these}} classes introduce the element proper to the other class, in a subordinate way. Paul Veronese introduces a subordinate light and shade, and Leonardo introduces a subordinate local color. The main difference is, that with Leonardo, Rembrandt, and Raphael, vast masses of the picture are lost in comparatively colorless (dark, grey, or brown) shadow; these painters beginning with the lights, and going down to blackness; but with Veronese, Titian, and Turner, the whole picture is like the rose,--glowing with color in the shadows, and rising into paler and more delicate hues, or masses of whiteness, in the lights; they having begun with the shadows, and gone up to whiteness.|$|R
50|$|The {{most famous}} apparel was called ‘'pështjellak'’ which {{consistent}} {{of a long}} white shirt, and two ‘'pështjellak'’ (a white apron), the front and the back one. ‘'pështjellaku i parmë'’, or the front apron is {{as long as the}} shirt, and it was tailored to fit the woman's hip. ‘'pështjellaku i pasëm'’, the back apron was shorter than the front one. Other components of this clothing were : ‘'tëlina't’ (traditional underwear), ‘'jeleku'’ -resembles a short vest which was embroidered, ‘'shokë’' a large woolen material circling the waist, traditional black socks, and different <b>color</b> <b>head</b> scarves.

50|$|The adult {{strawberry}} root weevil {{is about}} six millimeters long, and is dark brown/black in color. They are often found in the leaves and foliage of the plants they feed on. The adult weevil's elytra are fused together, which means {{they are unable to}} fly.The larvae can be up to thirteen millimeters long when fully grown and they are found near the roots of the plants they are infesting. The larvae are white, legless, with a darker <b>colored</b> <b>head</b> and are often C-shaped.|$|R

40|$|<b>Color</b> <b>head</b> and {{precocity}} {{of production}} are two important agronomic traits in globe artichoke which determine {{the acceptance of}} the product in the market. 118 F 2 plants were analyzed for two agronomic traits, <b>color</b> <b>head</b> and precocity of production. Bulked Segregant Analysis (BSA) and Sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) were used to detect molecular markers linked to the traits. Ten plants with the same trait were used to constitute the bulks, which were screened with seven SRAP pair primers. We detected one band/marker that may be linked to the green <b>color</b> <b>head</b> and one band/marker that may be associated with precocity in head production. The results obtained show that the BSA and SRAP analyses are useful to identify molecular markers associated with agronomic traits. The identified markers will potentially be used in molecular marker aided-selection (MAS) for breeding programs in globe artichok...|$|E
40|$|To {{simplify the}} 3 D <b>color</b> <b>head</b> mesh,it is more {{important}} to keep the boundary and quality of the head s sense organs including eyes, eyebrows, nose and mouth. In this paper, we present a novel mesh simplification algorithm based on region segmentation. The algorithm can be divided into two stages: segmentation and simplification. After the automatic segmentation of 3 D <b>color</b> <b>head</b> mesh into different head parts, vertices are classed into region-boundary vertices and region-inner vertices. Using iterative edge collapse and region-weighted error metric, the algorithm generates continuous levels of detail (LOD). Results of several experiments are shown, demonstrating the validity and efficiency of our method...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{improved}} and fully automatic face detection and facial feature extraction algorithms are introduced.

The more challenging task of facial feature extraction involves {{the identification of the}} sub-images containing the facial features. Each sub-image is analyzed by an efficient combination of a number of techniques such as: circle fitting, edge detection, and intensity based adaptive clustering. Our simulations indicate that the performance especially for the detection of facial features is significantly improved...|$|E

40|$|Bulbitermes {{is one of}} the endemic genera {{distributed}} in the Oriental Regions.

25|$|White {{factoring}} {{affects the}} amount of white on the dog. It is hard to tell, without actually breeding, whether a dog is white-factored or not, though dogs with white going up the stifle (the front of the hind leg) are usually assumed to be white-factored. Breeding two white-factored dogs can result in color-headed whites—Shelties with <b>colored</b> <b>heads</b> (sable, tricolor, bi-black, or blue or sable merle) and white bodies. For show dogs, dogs with more than 50% white are heavily penalized and thus are not shown in the breed ring; they are normal in every other way.|$|R
