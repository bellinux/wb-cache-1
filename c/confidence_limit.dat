40|$|The most {{commonly}} used method to test an indirect effect is to divide the estimate of the indirect effect by its standard error and compare the resulting z statistic with a critical value from the standard normal distribution. <b>Confidence</b> <b>limits</b> for the indirect effect are also typically based on critical values from the standard normal distribution.

Consequently, the expected effectiveness started (in practice) equal to the lower 95% <b>confidence</b> <b>limit</b> of the set values of measurement results. Later, in several studies, PF measurements were repeated to for the same worker, and specialists conducted statistical analysis. Nikas and Neyghauz tried to determine - then the expected PF will reliably protect not less than 95% of workers in more than 95% of cases of RPE usage. They took into account the volatility of PF of the individual worker and volatility of the average (mean) PF for the different workers. It turned out that then the expected PF (Assigned PF) = 10 efficiency respirators will be insufficient, and they are advised to reduce the Assigned PF to 5 for negative pressure half mask.|$|E

2500|$|Mars – the Martian {{atmosphere}} contains 10 nmol/mol methane. The {{source of}} methane on Mars {{has not been}} determined. Recent research suggests that methane may come from volcanoes, fault lines, or methanogens, {{that it may be}} a byproduct of electrical discharges from dust devils and dust storms, or that it {{may be the result of}} UV radiation. In January 2009, NASA scientists announced that they had discovered that the planet often vents methane into the atmosphere in specific areas, leading some to speculate this may be a sign of biological activity below the surface. Studies of a Weather Research and Forecasting model for Mars (MarsWRF) and related Mars general circulation model (MGCM) suggests that methane plume sources may be located within tens of kilometers, which is within the roving capabilities of future Mars rovers. The Curiosity rover, which landed on Mars in August 2012, can distinguish between different isotopologues of methane; but even if the mission determines that microscopic Martian life is the source of the methane, it probably resides far below the surface, beyond the rover's reach. Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument is capable of tracking the presence of methane over time to determine whether it is constant, variable, seasonal, or random, providing further clues about its source. The first measurements with the Tunable Laser Spectrometer (TLS) indicated that there is less than 5 ppb of methane at the landing site. [...] The Mars Trace Gas Mission orbiter planned for launch in 2016 would further study Mars' methane and its decomposition products such as formaldehyde and methanol.
