5|$|As dawn {{broke and}} {{visibility}} cleared, the sailors on <b>Ceylon,</b> Vénus and Victor realised {{that they were}} within sight of Saint Denis on Île Bourbon, and thus vulnerable to counterattack from Rowley's flagship Boadicea. Despite hasty repairs, neither <b>Ceylon</b> nor Vénus were seaworthy by 07:30, when British lookouts on the island spotted the three ships and sent word to Rowley. Within ten minutes, Rowley was at sea, taking 50 volunteers from Africaine to augment his crew. Hamelin made desperate efforts to limp back to Île de France, ordering Victor to tow <b>Ceylon,</b> but progress was slow and strong winds, which did not help the dismasted <b>Ceylon</b> and Vénus, repeatedly broke the tow rope.|$|E
5|$|Born into an {{expatriate}} <b>Ceylon</b> Tamil {{family in}} Malaya, Chelvanayakam moved to <b>Ceylon</b> while still young. He {{worked as a}} teacher before studying law at <b>Ceylon</b> Law College and qualifying as lawyer. A successful career in civil law saw him becoming a King's Counsel and being offered {{a position on the}} Supreme Court, which he rejected. As a young lawyer Chelvanayakam was not involved in politics but when the British established the Soulbury Commission to look into constitutional reform in <b>Ceylon</b> he and other Tamil people formed the All <b>Ceylon</b> Tamil Congress (ACTC) to represent Tamil interests. He was elected to Parliament in 1947 to represent Kankesanthurai, a constituency he would represent until his death, except for a period between 1952 and 1956. Chelvanayakam left the ACTC over the party's decision to join the government and in 1949 founded his own party, ITAK, also known as the Federal Party.|$|E
5|$|Captain George Simpson left England on 8 June 1814. At <b>Ceylon,</b> Arniston {{embarked}} {{soldiers of}} the 73rd Regiment, who were wounded in the Kandyan Wars in <b>Ceylon,</b> to repatriate them to England.|$|E
5|$|At 14:00, <b>Ceylon</b> spotted Hamelin's {{ships in}} pursuit and her crew {{increased}} {{their efforts to}} escape, mistaking Victor, which carried three masts, for a larger ship and therefore considering themselves significantly outnumbered. As night fell, Gordon slowed <b>Ceylon</b> by shortening sail {{in the hope of}} meeting Vénus (which had outdistanced Victor) alone. However, the French flagship also slowed to allow the corvette to catch up and so Gordon increased sail once more, leading Hamelin southwest towards Île Bourbon. At 00:15 on the morning of 18 September, Vénus caught up with <b>Ceylon,</b> which began firing on the larger French frigate as she passed. Hamelin, recognising that his vessel had the advantage in size and weight of shot, did not wait for Victor but attacked immediately, passing <b>Ceylon</b> and tuning across her bows to open a raking fire.|$|E
5|$|HMS <b>Ceylon</b> {{had been}} {{despatched}} by the British authorities at Madras after the Battle of Grand Port {{to reinforce the}} remains of the squadron under Commodore Josias Rowley on Île Bourbon. Searching for Rowley off Île de France, <b>Ceylon</b> was spotted by French Commodore Jacques Hamelin who gave chase in his flagship Vénus, supported by a corvette. Vénus was faster than <b>Ceylon,</b> and although Captain Charles Gordon almost reached the safety of Île Bourbon, he was run down and forced to engage the French ship during the night, both frigates inflicting severe damage on one another before the wounded Gordon surrendered to the approaching corvette. As dawn broke, Rowley's flagship HMS Boadicea arrived, recaptured <b>Ceylon,</b> drove off the corvette and forced the battered French flagship to surrender, capturing Hamelin. This was the last ship-to-ship action in the region before the successful invasion of Île de France in December 1810: without Hamelin the French squadron, short on supplies and low on morale, did not contest British control of the region and failed to even attempt to disrupt the invasion fleet.|$|E
5|$|ITAK {{had four}} main aims: {{creation}} of a federal union in <b>Ceylon</b> with two states - a Tamil state in the Northern and Eastern provinces and a Sinhalese state in the remaining seven provinces; cessation of state-sponsored colonisation in the two Tamil provinces; unity amongst the Tamil speaking peoples of <b>Ceylon</b> - <b>Ceylon</b> Tamils, Indian Tamils and Muslims; and equal status for Sinhala and Tamil languages. Chelvanayakam lost his seat in the 1952 parliamentary election but regained it in the 1956 parliamentary election. As Ceylon's two main parties, the UNP and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), introduced policies which further discriminated against the country's minorities, such as the Sinhala Only Act which made Sinhala the sole official language of <b>Ceylon,</b> ITAK's Tamil nationalism became more popular than the ACTC's conservatism. In the 1956 parliamentary election the ITAK overtook the ACTC as the most popular party amongst <b>Ceylon</b> Tamils. On 5 June 1956 a group of Tamil activists and parliamentarians, led by Chelvanayakam, staged a satyagraha (a form of non-violent resistance) against the Sinhala Only Act on Galle Face Green opposite the Parliament. The satyagrahis were attacked by a Sinhalese mob as the police looked on, and ITAK MPs E. M. V. Naganathan and V. N. Navaratnam were thrown in Beira Lake.|$|E
5|$|The French {{corvette}} {{had been}} struggling to catch up during the night and did not arrive until dawn approached, revealing the flagship in a damaged state and the British vessel even more stricken. Sailing directly at <b>Ceylon,</b> the corvette was able to manoeuvre around the frigate and place herself in a raking position, from which her cannon could cause heavy damage and casualties to <b>Ceylon</b> without reply. Rather than have his ship destroyed, the wounded Gordon surrendered (although {{it is not clear}} whether Victor opened fire or not before the British surrender). Victors men boarded <b>Ceylon</b> and Gordon and his officers, including Abercromby, were taken to Vénus as prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|The Invasion of <b>Ceylon</b> was a {{military}} campaign fought {{as a series of}} amphibious operations between the summer of 1795 and spring of 1796 between the garrison of the Batavian colonies on the Indian Ocean island of <b>Ceylon</b> (now Sri Lanka) and a British invasion force sent from British India. The Dutch Republic had been a British ally during the French Revolutionary Wars, but was overrun by the French Republic in the winter of 1794 and reformed into the client state of the Batavian Republic. The British government, working with the exiled Stadtholder William of Orange, ordered the seizure of Batavian assets including colonies of the former Dutch Empire. Among the first territories to be attacked were those on the coast of the island of <b>Ceylon,</b> with operations initially focused on the trading port at Trincomalee.|$|E
5|$|The {{value of}} the {{captured}} goods from Colombo alone amounted to more than £300,000. More importantly for the British, <b>Ceylon</b> {{was not one of}} the colonies returned to the Batavian Republic following the Treaty of Amiens which brought the war to a brief close in 1802. Britain retained <b>Ceylon</b> as part of the British Empire until independence was granted in 1948.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} back in New Zealand, Stewart joined the New Zealand Staff Corps. After {{serving as a}} staff officer, firstly to the commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces {{and then in the}} Central Military District, he attended the Staff College at Camberley, England, for several years. In 1931, he was seconded to the <b>Ceylon</b> Defence Force, where he spent three years as a staff officer. He returned to New Zealand in 1934 and was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his services in <b>Ceylon.</b> He held staff positions in Southern Command, the military district that covered the South Island of New Zealand, until 1939.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of his career, Sellers also {{performed}} acts in a number of variety shows in various parts of Britain; his wartime service with the Gang Shows of Ralph Reader saw him perform in India, <b>Ceylon</b> and Burma.|$|E
5|$|During the day, Boadicea {{continued}} to close until Victor {{was forced to}} abandon <b>Ceylon</b> and sail in support of Vénus at 15:30. As soon as the French prize crew was removed, Lieutenant Philip Fitz Gibbon, the remaining officer on <b>Ceylon,</b> rehoisted British colours and assumed control of the ship. This allowed Boadicea to sail past the recaptured frigate and engage the French ships directly, reaching Vénus at 16:40. Hamelin recognised that the battered state of his flagship meant {{that he would not}} be able to adequately defend against Rowley's attack and ordered Victor to take news of his defeat back to Port Napoleon. Readying his ship for a token action, Hamelin fired at Boadicea as she came up but was forced to surrender within ten minutes.|$|E
5|$|From 1774 until 1858, Madras {{was a part}} of British India and {{was ruled}} by the British East India Company. The last quarter of the 18th century was a period of rapid expansion. Successful wars against Tipu Sultan (1782–99), Velu Thambi, Polygars and <b>Ceylon</b> added vast areas of land and contributed to the {{exponential}} growth of the Presidency. Newly conquered <b>Ceylon</b> formed part of the Madras Presidency between 1793 and 1798. The system of subsidiary alliances originated by Lord Wellesley as Governor-General of India (1798–1805) also brought many princely states into the area militarily subordinate to the Governor of Fort St George. The hill tracts of Ganjam and Visakhapatnam were the last places to be annexed by the British.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries the British {{recruited}} {{large numbers}} of South Indians, primarily Indian Tamils, to work in tea, coffee, rubber and coconut plantations in <b>Ceylon.</b> Ceylon's majority Sinhalese viewed Indian Tamils with deep suspicion, fearing that they would dominate the island's central highlands and ally themselves with the indigenous <b>Ceylon</b> Tamils, increasing the latter's political strength. Following independence from Britain in February 1948, Ceylon's Sinhalese dominated government introduced the <b>Ceylon</b> Citizenship Bill which {{had the effect of}} denying citizenship and making stateless the country's Indian Tamils, who by now accounted for 11% of the population. The bill provided for citizenship by descent or registration but both required documentary proof, something that was difficult for most Indian Tamils, many of whom were illiterate. The ACTC opposed the bill which was passed by Parliament at its second reading on 20 August 1948. Shortly afterwards Ponnambalam decided to join the United National Party (UNP) led government which caused a split in the ACTC. Eventually the ACTC dissidents, led by Chelvanayakam, E. M. V. Naganathan and C. Vanniasingam formed the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK, Federal Party) on 18 December 1949.|$|E
5|$|Rainier {{hoped that}} the Dutch commanders would peacefully {{transfer}} control of their colonies to the British after provision of the Kew Letters from Stadtholder William of Orange. However at Trincomalee the governor resisted and an invasion of <b>Ceylon</b> went ahead. After a short bombardment, Trincomalee capitulated on 26 August, although Diomede was wrecked during the landing operation. With the principal fort taken, the remaining Batavian towns on <b>Ceylon</b> surrendered peaceably over the following month, as did the Batavian trading port of Cochin in India. Pakenham's force was able to seize Malacca without resistance on 17 August 1795.|$|E
5|$|The Gregorys {{travelled}} in <b>Ceylon,</b> India, Spain, Italy and Egypt. While in Egypt, Lady Gregory had {{an affair}} with the English poet Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, during which she wrote a series of love poems, A Woman's Sonnets.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{fourteen}} Prime Ministers of Sri Lanka since {{the creation of}} the position in 1947, prior to the formation of the Dominion of <b>Ceylon.</b> The Prime Minister of <b>Ceylon</b> {{was the head of the}} government until 1978. In 1972, the country was named as the Free, Sovereign and Independent Republic of Sri Lanka and the position was known as the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka from then onwards. The Prime Minister also held the unified Ministry of External Affairs and Defence until 1977, when J.R. Jayewardene's government adapted two separate ministries, forming the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.|$|E
5|$|A 3,000-strong Army unit, as well {{as several}} Australian {{warships}} and aircraft from a number of RAAF squadrons participated in the unsuccessful defence of Java when the Japanese invaded the island in March1942. An Army force made up of elements from the 7thDivision also formed part of the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM) land forces on Java but saw little action before it surrendered at Bandung on 12March after the Dutch forces on the island began to capitulate. Following the conquest of the NEI, the Japanese Navy's main aircraft carrier force raided the Indian Ocean, attacking <b>Ceylon</b> in early April. The two Australian Army brigades stationed at <b>Ceylon</b> {{at the time of the}} raid were placed on alert to repel a potential invasion but did not see action as this did not eventuate.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} the Atlantic Ocean on the RMS Lusitania to London, where they gathered the supplies {{they would need}} for their expedition, Beebe and his team traveled across the Mediterranean Sea to Egypt, through the Suez Canal, and across the Indian Ocean to <b>Ceylon,</b> where they began their task of documenting the native wildfowl. From <b>Ceylon</b> they traveled to Calcutta, {{with the goal of}} capturing the species of pheasants which live only in the Himalayas. By this point Beebe was beginning to be in conflict with Horsfall, who was unaccustomed to such expeditions. After Beebe had finished his documentation {{in the eastern part of}} the range, Horsfall refused to accompany Beebe in the western part of the range, causing Beebe to leave him in the town of Jorepokhri and continue his work in the Western Himalayas without him. Horsfall rejoined them in Calcutta, from which they sailed to Indonesia. The next ship took them to Singapore, where Beebe established a base of operations for the next stage of his expedition.|$|E
5|$|After the Test series ended, Miller captained a Commonwealth XI {{that played}} against a touring England team in Colombo, <b>Ceylon.</b> England {{had been on}} a tour of the Indian subcontinent. Miller scored 106 as the Commonwealth {{compiled}} 517. Miller took three wickets in the first innings and led his team to a victory by an innings and 259runs.|$|E
5|$|Arniston was an East Indiaman {{that made}} eight voyages for the British East India Company (EIC). She was wrecked on 30 May 1815 during a storm at Waenhuiskrans, near Cape Agulhas, South Africa, {{with the loss}} of 372 lives – only six on board survived. She had been {{chartered}} as a troopship and was underway from <b>Ceylon</b> to England on a journey to repatriate wounded soldiers from the Kandyan Wars.|$|E
5|$|As Minerve {{turned back}} towards the British convoy with the {{intention}} of cutting off the rearmost ships, Astell passed her more damaged companions to become the first ship in line. This left Windham, now at the rear, to face Minerve alone. Fortunately for Stewart, Minerve lost two topmasts as she turned to face his ship and had to pull away from the British to effect repairs. An hour and a half later, at 18:30, Bellone joined the action, attacking Windham directly. Victor supported Bellone and accompanied the flagship as she moved ahead to attack <b>Ceylon</b> and Astell. By 19:00, with <b>Ceylon</b> damaged so severely that she could no longer effectively sail or fight, third officer Tristam Fleming hauled the ship out of the battle line and ordered his crew to cease firing: Meriton and his second officer Thomas Oldham had both been seriously wounded by grape shot.|$|E
5|$|Blowing from a gun was a {{reported}} means of execution {{as long ago}} as the 16th century, by the Mughal Empire, and was used until the 20th century. The method was utilized by Portuguese colonialists in the 16th and 17th centuries, from as early as 1509 across their empire from <b>Ceylon</b> (modern day Sri Lanka) to Mozambique to Brazil. The Mughals used the method throughout the 17th century and into the 18th, particularly against rebels.|$|E
5|$|Chelvanayakam married Emily Grace Barr-Kumarakulasinghe (Rathinam), {{daughter}} of R. R. Barr-Kumarakulasinghe, in 1927. The Barr-Kumarakulasinghes were an influential family from Tellippalai who served the Dutch and British administrations in <b>Ceylon.</b> R. R. Barr-Kumarakulasinghe was Maniagar (British appointed administrative chief) for the Valikamam region. The Chelvanayakams had four sons (Manoharan, Vaseekaran, Ravindran and Chandrahasan) {{and a daughter}} (Susila).|$|E
5|$|Chelvanayakam {{was born}} on 31 March 1898 in Ipoh, Malaya. He {{was the son of}} Visvanathan Velupillai, a businessman, and Harriet Annamma Kanapathipillai. Velupillai had been a school teacher in Tholpuram in {{northern}} <b>Ceylon</b> before migrating to Malaya as a contractor. Chelvanayakam had two brothers (Ernest Velupillai Ponnuthurai and Edward Rajasundaram) and a sister (Atputham Isabel). The family later moved from Ipoh to Taiping.|$|E
5|$|Chelvanayakam {{was educated}} at Union College, Tellippalai and St. John's College, Jaffna. After school he joined S. Thomas' College, Mutwal and {{obtained}} an external degree in science from the University of London in 1918. At St. Thomas Chelvanayakam was a contemporary of S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, future Prime Minister of <b>Ceylon.</b> After graduation Chelvanayakam visited {{his father in}} Malaya in 1918 shortly before his death.|$|E
5|$|D. zibethinus was {{introduced}} into <b>Ceylon</b> by the Portuguese in the 16th century and was reintroduced many times later. It has been {{planted in the}} Americas but confined to botanical gardens. The first seedlings were sent from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, to Auguste Saint-Arroman of Dominica in 1884.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{unexpectedly}} strong {{success of}} the Victory Tests, the government of Australia ordered the team to delay their demobilisation. With the team raising so much money for war charities, the government directed them to travel home via India and <b>Ceylon</b> for further fundraising matches for the Red Cross.|$|E
5|$|During the Portuguese and Dutch colonial periods (1619–1796), Muttukumara Kavirajar is the {{earliest}} known author who used literature to respond to Christian missionary activities. He was followed by Arumuga Navalar, who wrote and published a number of books. The period of joint missionary activities by the Anglican, American <b>Ceylon,</b> and Methodist Missions also saw the spread of modern education {{and the expansion of}} translation activities.|$|E
5|$|During {{the passage}} from <b>Ceylon,</b> at one o'clock every day, the ships signalled each other their {{longitude}} that they calculated using their chronometers. In this way, the ships were able to compare their respective instruments, and {{the master of the}} Arniston was able to learn his longitude too, as long as he remained in the convoy.|$|E
5|$|Following the Japanese raid on <b>Ceylon</b> of March–April 1942, the Eastern Fleet was {{transferred}} from its base at Trincomalee, {{to the other}} side of the Indian Ocean: Kilindi in Kenya. From there the fleet undertook local patrols, escorted convoys and occasionally despatched ships to operations in the Mediterranean. During Operation Vigorous, a convoy to Malta in June 1942, Nestor was serious damaged in an air raid and slowly sank.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the conquest}} of the NEI, the Japanese Navy's main {{aircraft}} carrier force raided the Indian Ocean. This force attacked <b>Ceylon</b> in early April, and Vampire was sunk off Trincomalee on 12 April while escorting , which was also lost. The Australian Army's 16th and 17th Brigades formed part of the island's garrison {{at the time of}} the raid but did not see action.|$|E
5|$|For an {{hour the}} frigates {{exchanged}} broadsides, until 01:15 when Hamelin, who had realised {{that he was}} fighting a warship not a troopship or East Indiaman, dropped back to effect repairs after suffering damage to his rigging. <b>Ceylon</b> was more severely damaged than the French ship and when Hamelin returned at 02:15, her repairs were not complete, preventing her escape. The battle began again, both frigates suffering serious damage in the second encounter. By 03:00, Vénus had lost her mizzenmast and two topmasts, while <b>Ceylon</b> had lost all of her topmasts, which had destroyed much of the ship's rigging as they fell. With both ships now unable to manoeuvre, the action continued at close range until 04:00, when Vénus was able to haul herself away to await the arrival of Victor.|$|E
5|$|Heber {{remained}} in Bombay for four months, {{and then decided}} that, instead of sailing directly for Calcutta, he would visit <b>Ceylon</b> on the way. He arrived at Galle on 25 August and spent five weeks touring the main cities before departing for Calcutta where he arrived on 19 October 1825 after an absence of 16 months.|$|E
5|$|In February 1941, {{the ship}} {{supported}} Commonwealth forces in Italian Somaliland during the East African Campaign and did {{much the same}} two months later in the Persian Gulf during the Anglo-Iraqi War. After that campaign, Hermes {{spent most of the}} rest of the year patrolling the Indian Ocean. She was refitted in South Africa between November 1941 and February 1942 and then joined the Eastern Fleet at <b>Ceylon.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{was hoped}} by Stuart and Rainer that the Batavian {{governor}} Johan Van Angelbeek might {{be persuaded to}} allow a peaceful occupation of <b>Ceylon</b> by British forces, {{especially in light of}} the Kew Letters from William of Orange, which advocated cooperation with British forces. A Major Agnew was sent ashore at Colombo to negotiate and his attempts to persuade Van Angelbeek to allow 300 British troops to land at Fort Oostenberg, which overlooked Trincomalee, were successful. On arrival off the port on the eastern coast of <b>Ceylon</b> on 1 August however the commander of the defences refused to acknowledge the instruction, citing problems with the wording of the instructions. For two days attempts were made to convince the Batavian commander, the British position partially undermined by the destruction of Diomede in Trincomalee harbour after striking an uncharted rock. Although all of the crew and passengers were saved, large quantities of military stores sank with the frigate.|$|E
