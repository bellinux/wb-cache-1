Lyrically, though the song {{appears to be}} about dancing and sex, in reality Madonna uses sarcasm to {{emphasize}} the longevity of her career. The lyrics explain {{that she does not}} want to retire from her career at that moment and possesses the ability to continue, as noted in the lines [...] "Don't stop me now, no need to <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> breath, I can {{go on and on and}} on." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tench formed The Gass with Godfrey and Errol McLean in May 1965, {{credited}} as Robert Tench and featured as vocalist, guitarist {{and bass}} player. The band played {{mainly in the}} London Club circuit with other appearances elsewhere in the U.K and occasional tours in Europe. The Gass were often accompanied on stage by guest musicians,such as Georgie Fame,Jimi Hendrix and Eric Burdon. They recorded two singles for Parlophone and another for CBS with their original lineup, before taking a more progressive musical direction. During 1968 they were supporting bands such as Led Zeppelin. Tench moved on with drummer Godfrey McLean {{to form a new}} lineup and were signed by Polydor Records in 1969. By now the band was simply known as Gass and were already playing as the backing band for <b>Catch</b> <b>My</b> Soul, a stage musical produced by Jack Good. Tench sang some parts for Othello and he featured with the band on the original UK cast recording of <b>Catch</b> <b>My</b> Soul-Rock Othello, released a year later. They recorded Juju (1970), which was soon removed from retail outlets and re-released as Gass. Juju featured the Fleetwood Mac guitarist Peter Green on the tracks [...] "Juju" [...] and [...] "Black Velvet".|$|E
2500|$|The Roundhouse {{has also}} been used for theatre, and has had two periods of {{theatrical}} glory, with musicals such as <b>Catch</b> <b>My</b> Soul (1969). Under administrator George Hoskins, the first phase also featured experimental theatre productions, such as the Living Theatre production of 1776 and other plays directed by Peter Brook. The once controversial nude revue Oh! Calcutta! opened in July 1970, and started a run of nearly four thousand performances in London, and the anarchic [...] "Evening of British Rubbish" [...] with professor Bruce Lacey and the Alberts had one performance in 1967.|$|E

2500|$|The American actor William Marshall {{performed}} {{the title role}} in at least six productions. His Othello was called by Harold Hobson of the London Sunday Times [...] "the best Othello of our time," [...] continuing: [...] "nobler than Tearle, more martial than Gielgud, more poetic than Valk. From his first entry, slender and magnificently tall, framed in a high Byzantine arch, clad in white samite, mystic, wonderful, a figure of Arabian romance and grace, to his last plunging oif the knife into his stomach, Mr Marshall rode without faltering the play's enormous rhetoric, {{and at the end}} the house rose to him." [...] Marshall also played Othello in a jazz musical version, <b>Catch</b> <b>My</b> Soul, with Jerry Lee Lewis as Iago, in Los Angeles in 1968. His Othello was captured on record in 1964 with Jay Robinson as Iago and on video in 1981 with Ron Moody as Iago. The 1982 Broadway staging starred James Earl Jones as Othello and Christopher Plummer as Iago.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1948, {{following}} {{the establishment of}} a Communist regime, {{he was elected to the}} Romanian Academy subsequent to the purge of a large number of members. Roller was part of a wave of new academicians, most of whom were of peripheral importance in their fields but were staunch adherents of communism and ready to act as ideological enforcers. Elected the Academy's Vice President (seconding Traian Săvulescu), he also headed the Section for History, Philosophy, Economics and Law from 1949 to 1955. Roller believed the academy should shift from its former position of [...] "a feudal caste, a closed circle, isolated from the masses and the people's needs" [...] into [...] "a living and active factor in the development of our science and culture". Moreover, he exhorted members, regardless of their specialty, to apply Marxist-Leninist teaching on society and its development, proletarian revolutions, the building of socialism and the victory of communism. When Săvulescu suggested that Academy publications should go uncensored, Roller intervened and reimposed [...] "control", noting: [...] "I am here to supervise and cut out those bits that <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> eye." [...] Even the more traditionalist members of the communist academic establishment were irritated by Roller's interventions. Scholar Mihai Ralea allegedly called him [...] "an incompetent, evil rube".|$|E
2500|$|Frustrated by Smash's {{inability}} {{to score a}} hit, Lewis was {{nearing the end of}} his contract when promotions manager Eddie Kilroy called him and pitched the idea of cutting a pure country record in Nashville. [...] With nothing to lose, Lewis agreed to record the Jerry Chestnut song [...] "Another Place, Another Time", which was released as a single on March 9, 1968, and, to everyone's amazement, shot up the country charts. [...] At the time of the release, Lewis had been playing Iago in a rock and roll adaptation of Othello called <b>Catch</b> <b>My</b> Soul in Los Angeles but was soon rushed back to Nashville to record another batch of songs with producer Jerry Kennedy. [...] What followed was a string of hits that no one could have ever predicted, although country music had remained a major part of Lewis's repertoire. [...] As Colin Escott observes in the sleeve to the 1995 compilation Killer Country, the conversion to country music in 1968 [...] "looked at the time like a radical shift, but it was neither as abrupt nor as unexpected as it seemed. [...] Jerry had always recorded country music, and his country breakthrough 'Another Place, Another Time' had been preceded by many, many country records starting with his first, 'Crazy Arms', in 1956." [...] The last time Lewis had a song on the country charts was with [...] "Pen And Paper" [...] in 1964, which had reached number 36, but [...] "Another Place, Another Time" [...] would {{go all the way to}} number 4 and remain on the charts for 17 weeks.|$|E

6000|$|I {{was still}} making my observations, when I heard {{the crack of}} a shot, and the ripping of plank, on the forward part of the quarter-deck.

Sure enough, there was my old friend grievously wounded. Clements was also there. <b>Catching</b> <b>my</b> eye, he observed-- ...|$|R

And {{then all of a sudden}} I <b>catched</b> <b>my</b> breath and grabbed Tom's arm, and all my livers and lungs and things fell down into my legs.|$|R

500|$|Film {{historian}} Joseph McBride considered O'Hara's {{performance to}} have been the most powerful and intense emotionally he'd seen since Katharine Hepburn in Mary of Scotland (1936). O'Hara stated that her favorite scene in the film took place outside the church after her character gets married, remarking, [...] "I make my way down the steps to the carriage waiting below, the wind <b>catches</b> <b>my</b> veil and fans it out in a perfect circle all the way around my face. Then it floats straight up above my head and points to the heavens. It's breathtaking." ...|$|R
