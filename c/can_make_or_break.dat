For Kubrick, written dialogue was one element {{to be put in}} balance with mise en scène (set arrangements), music, and especially, editing. Inspired by Pudovkin's treatise on film editing, Kubrick realized that one could create a performance in the editing room and often [...] "re-direct" [...] a film, and he remarked: [...] "I love editing. I think I like it more than any other phase of filmmaking... Editing is the only unique aspect of filmmaking which does not resemble any other art form—a point so important it cannot be overstressed... It <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>break</b> a film". Biographer John Baxter stated that [...] "Instead of finding the intellectual spine of a film in the script before starting work, Kubrick felt his way towards the final version of a film by shooting each scene from many angles and demanding scores of takes on each line. Then over months... he arranged and rearranged {{the tens of thousands of}} scraps of film to fit a vision that really only began to emerge during editing".|$|E

Based on new research into luxury sales teams worldwide, Merk explores how salespeople's relationships with brands they sell emerge, how they can be characterized and what top management should do to strengthen these in order to use the sales force–brand relationship as a strategic tool. Merk shows that these relationships have the power to increase salespeople's selling motivation, their commitment to both the organization and its brands, and ultimately {{the success of}} the company...|$|R

The usage of Building Information Modeling (BIM) for H&S on construction execution {{has the potential to}} augment practitioner understanding of their sites, and by so doing reduce the probability of accidents.

Methods: In addition to an extensive literature review, a questionnaire survey was conducted to gather information on the embedment of H&S planning with the BIM environment for site practitioners. Results: The analysis of responses indicated that BIM will enhance the current approach of H&S planning for construction site personnel. Conclusion: From the survey, toolbox talk will have to be integrated with the BIM environment, because it is the predominantly used procedure for enhancing H&S issues within construction sites. The advantage is that personnel can visually understand H&S issues as work progresses during the toolbox talk onsite...|$|R
