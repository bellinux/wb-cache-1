25|$|Although all {{the four}} credit {{information}} companies have developed their individual credit scores, {{the most popular}} is CIBIL credit score. The CIBIL credit score is a three-digit number that represents a summary of individuals' <b>credit</b> <b>history</b> and credit rating. This score ranges from 300 to 900, with 900 being the best score. Individuals with no <b>credit</b> <b>history</b> will have a score of -1. If the <b>credit</b> <b>history</b> is less than six months, the score will be 0. CIBIL credit score takes time to build up and usually it takes between 18 and 36 months or more of credit usage to obtain a satisfactory credit score.|$|E
25|$|The {{cardholder}} of a {{secured credit}} card is still {{expected to make}} regular payments, as with a regular credit card, but should they default on a payment, the card issuer has the option of recovering {{the cost of the}} purchases paid to the merchants out of the deposit.

This allows building a positive <b>credit</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E
25|$|Secured {{credit cards}} are an option to allow {{a person with a}} poor <b>credit</b> <b>history</b> or no <b>credit</b> <b>history</b> to have a credit card which might not {{otherwise}} be available. They are often offered as a means of rebuilding one's credit. Fees and service charges for secured credit cards often exceed those charged for ordinary non-secured credit cards. For people in certain situations, (for example, after charging off on other credit cards, or people with a long history of delinquency on various forms of debt), secured cards are almost always more expensive than unsecured credit cards.|$|E

25|$|Prior {{to credit}} cards, each {{merchant}} had to evaluate each customer's <b>credit</b> <b>history</b> before extending credit.

500|$|Cox {{left his}} job as an {{insurance}} agent {{to work as a}} mortgage broker for a local company. While there he developed a reputation for unscrupulousness, which was heightened by his authorship of an unpublished 317-page manuscript entitled The Associates. The novel's protagonist, who shares many traits in common with Cox, travels the country committing mortgage fraud. Cox told co-workers about the book, and elaborated its details to them. [...] "He sent it {{to a lot of people}} to see if they thought it worked" [...] said a former co-worker. After being fired from the company when he was convicted of mortgage fraud in 2002, Cox faked a good <b>credit</b> <b>history,</b> and used that to buy dozens of homes and properties. In one instance he used the social security number of a toddler, and all of his documents—references, bank letters, rent receipts, W-2s from nonexistent employees—were counterfeit. He used his skills as an artist to decorate the properties with elaborate art deco-style murals. Several of his future girlfriends said that his painting talents were part of his allure, though the St. Petersburg Times described his works as copies of murals by Tamara de Lempicka. Cox charmed Alison Arnold, a young local married woman, into believing he could give her a wealthy and luxurious life. While courting Arnold she said he took her to crime films such as The Italian Job and Catch Me if You Can—which he reportedly adored and watched several times—and detailed his criminal plans to her.|$|E
500|$|The {{week that}} Hauck {{was sentenced to}} prison, Cox was living in Nashville, Tennessee under the name Joseph Carter.

He told her he was from a wealthy family, and his silver 2005 Infiniti and [...] "fashionably decorated bungalow" [...] seemed to confirm this. Cox used a falsified passport to travel to Europe on a cruise of the Greek Isles with Gardner. He did not spend much time in Italy or Greece due to his intense fear of Interpol. He was reported by Gardner's 60-year-old babysitter, Patsy Taylor. She became suspicious of Cox, so she researched him online, where she discovered his true identity. Taylor was put in contact with the attorney of Rebecca Hauck by a St. Petersburg Times reporter. Hauck's family paid Taylor for Cox's address, as this information could be used to reduce Hauck's sentence. He temporarily escaped capture due to a chance series of events. Cox and Gardner's home was burglarized, and they checked into a hotel. On November 16, 2006, Cox was arrested by a half dozen Secret Service agents—who had been pursuing him for more than two years—when he and Gardner returned from the hotel. He had been building Williamson a house using his fake identity and <b>credit</b> <b>history,</b> but, fortunately for his friend, he was arrested before Williamson could give him a down payment. Hauck's sentence was later reduced from 70 to 42 months {{as a result of her}} assistance in Cox's capture.|$|E
