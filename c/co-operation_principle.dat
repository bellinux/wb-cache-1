40|$|The {{principle}} behind concurrent {{logic programming}} {{is a set}} of processes which co-operate in monotonically constraining a global set of variables to particular values. Each process will have access to only some of the variables, and a process may bind a variable to a tuple containing further variables which may be bound later by other processes. This is a suitable model for a coordination language. In this paper we describe a type system which ensures the <b>co-operation</b> <b>principle</b> is never breached, and which makes clear through syntax the pattern of data flow in a concurrent logic program. This overcomes problems previously associated with the practical use of concurrent logic languages...|$|E
40|$|One very {{important}} {{area of research}} on English in the “Outer Circle ” {{has been on the}} extent to which text types have become nativized in the home culture. Yet, there seems to be a dearth of interest in this domain of study in Cameroon. With ample evidence from dissertation acknowledgements and private letters, this study assesses the cultural-specific indicators that make these text types distinctive. Because these texts are culturally and situationally highly bound, the investigation relies not only on the Sociolinguistic Approach generally used in such analyses, but also on the Cultural-based Approach and Grice’s <b>Co-operation</b> <b>Principle.</b> Two hundred dissertation acknowledgements and 222 private letters have been used. And findings reveal that both text types show a greater degree of adaptation to the “culture of community ” characteristic of traditional African lifestyle. For example, the general configuration of dissertation acknowledgements, and to a certain extent private letters, reflect the “good manners ” of deference to elders and those who have played an important role in the writer’s life and success. Other contextually determined features such as the transfer of native devices for personalizing speech interaction are frequent. The study concludes that while text-type research remains a rich area of study in view of the establishment of a profile of Cameroon-specific features of new Englishes, it is equally a good basis on which to investigate the ethnography of culture. Here linguistics and cultural studies will find a useful match...|$|E

In both the developed and developing world, co-operative models are increasingly viewed as central to tackling a diverse array of issues, including global food security, climate change, sustainable economic development, public service provision and gender inequality. This collection, drawing together research from an interdisciplinary group of scholars and co-operative practitioners, considers the different spheres in which co-operatives are becoming more prominent. Drawing examples from different national and international contexts, the book offers major insights into how co-operation will come to occupy a more central role in social and economic life in the twenty-first century...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to analyse}} the relationship between women’s organising and established politics in three Swedish municipalities, and by way of this analysis study the construction of gender power orders. In the analysis, special emphasis is put on women’s agency. By posing questions to activists and local politicians concerning their opinions about women’s organising, the positions of women in established politics, {{and the concept of}} gender-equality, the ambition is to illuminate constructions of local gender power orders. The analysis is mainly based on interviews with activists, local politicians, and local administrators in the municipalities of Berg, Kiruna, and Robertsfors. Theoretically, the dissertation is influenced mainly by feminist theory of gender power relations and women’s agency, for example the work of Maud Eduards, and the theories about power and resistance developed by Michel Foucault. Carol Bacchi’s “What’s the problem?” approach is used when analysing the opinions of activists and politicians regarding the issue of gender-equality. In this approach, the way of constructing problems is the key, not “the problem” as such. The point is to constantly question phenomena that are defined as natural or self-evident, or, in other words, to deconstruct dominating discourses. When the interviews with the politicians were analysed with the ambition of discerning a dominant discourse of gender power, five limiting principles became visible; essential (in biological terms) differences between women and men, figures and complementarity, reduction, voluntariness, and <b>co-operation.</b> The <b>principle</b> of differences appears to be central, and all the principles place questions of gender-equality on the labour market. The “gap” between activists and politicians regarding the way in which gender is constructed is put forward as the main reason why women’s organising meets resistance from the sphere of local, established politics. This gap is also the central ingredient {{in the construction of the}} three local gender power orders, even if there are also other differences between the three. Key words: Women’s organising, women’s movement, gender-equality, rural areas, local politics, gender and politics, feminist theor...|$|R

Although information on skin absorption data are not a formal requirement under REACH, data on dermal absorption {{are an integral part}} of risk assessment of substances/products to which man is predominantly exposed via the dermal route. In this study, we assess the present applicability of publicly available QSARs on skin absorption for risk assessment purposes. We explicitly did not aim to give scientific judgments on individual QSARs. A total of 33 QSARs selected from the public domain were evaluated using the OECD (Organisation for Economic <b>Co-operation</b> and Development) <b>Principles</b> for the Validation of (Q) SAR Models. Additionally, several pragmatic criteria were formulated to select QSARs that are most suitable for their use in regulatory risk assessment. Based on these criteria, four QSARs were selected. The predictivity of these QSARs was evaluated by comparing their outcomes with experimentally derived skin absorption data (for 62 compounds). The predictivity was low for three of four QSARs, whereas one model gave reasonable predictions. Several suggestions are made to increase the applicability of QSARs for skin absorption for risk assessment purposes...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} discusses how South African Corporate Governance {{has been}} influenced by corporate failures and foreign law, through comparing international jurisdictions. The dissertation comprises of five chapters, beginning with an introductory Chapter One. The introductory chapter provides a background and sets out the research problem and questions to be answered {{as well as the}} methodology used in this study. Chapter Two introduces the concept of corporate governance and is divided into two parts. Part one focuses on principles of good corporate governance as set out by the King Report of 2002 and the Organisation of Economic <b>Co-operation</b> and Development <b>principles</b> of corporate governance. Part Two discusses the importance of corporate governance as it applies to organisations. Part Three considers the different models of corporate governance and where South Africa fits. Chapter three provides case study examples of corporate failures and corporate governance development in both the United Kingdom and the United States of America, to provide an understanding of the negative implications of failing to establish and adhere to corporate governance protocols. In Chapter Four examples are provided relating to corporate failures and corporate governance development in the South African context in particular. Finally Chapter Five summarises the research findings and concludes this dissertation. In addition to highlighting how corporate failures have influenced the development of corporate governance and how these together with foreign law have influenced corporate governance in South Africa, the study recommends that an African-centred approach to corporate governance be adopted in South Africa and the continent.

40|$|The Halogenated Aromatic Compounds (HAC) are {{considered}} an emerging group of persistent chemical pollutants dangerous and potentially harmful to human health. Their biological activities as the binding affinity to the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) is of fundamental importance {{to detect the}} toxicity of these compounds on living organisms. AhR binding affinity has been used throughout the text as log RBA. In this study, the Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship/Quantitative Structure-Toxicity Relationship (QSAR/QSTR) methods were used to create some models developed on log RBA values of a data set of 108 congeners from halogenated aromatic compounds (PCBs, PCDDs, PCDFs, PBDDs, PBDEs, some substituted PCB groups and congeners from bromo chloro substituted dibenzo dioxin groups) by employing the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The used descriptors were from DRAGON 06 and SPARTAN 04 software, whereas the models are developed from QSARINS (evaluation version b 1. 1 2012) software.

The activities of the Council of Ministers {{in the field of}} culture interact with other areas of formal and informal Nordic co-operation, both in and outside the Nordic region. In a global context, the Nordic region will continue to lead the way as a creative and open region in terms of art and culture. Nordic cultural co-operation will manage the historical, cultural and linguistic heritage and ensure continuity, but will also encourage new cultural expressions and impulses. Changes in circumstances relating to cultural life and art, demography and technology call for flexibility and renewal. It is important that cultural policy is developed and implemented on the basis of relevant and current facts, research and knowledge. Fundamental to Nordic cultural <b>co-operation</b> is the <b>principle</b> of Nordic added value, i. e. that the collaboration involves areas where the Nordic countries have common interests and face common challenges. Exchange of experiences, skills, and formation of networks will enable efficiency and development. The cultural co-operation will promote sustainable development. This involves joint efforts to stimulate inclusive, accessible and gender-equal culture and art that challenges norms and values, and that gives people a greater sense of purpose and belonging. Broad cultural co-operation will develop a sense of community and understanding between everyone living in the Nordic region, and will enhance cohesion.

The Nordic cultural co-operation will communicate values such as democracy, freedom of expression and the importance of civil society in both international and regional contexts...|$|R
40|$|The paper agues that {{experience}} and empirical evidence {{have shown that}} Africa’straditional trade-focused model of regional integration has failed not only in promotingintra-regional and African trade but also economic growth. However, regional integrationremains a basic ingredient towards the attainment of high and sustainable economic growthin the continent. To realize this potential, there is therefore, the need to search for newmodalities of regionalism that lean more towards co-operation, less rigidity and morepragmatism. The paper suggests that the principles of variable geometry and subsidiaritycould be usefully applied in this more pragmatic modality for defining the functions andpowers of the various layers of the new regional <b>co-operation</b> institutions. The <b>principle</b> ofvariable geometry permits integration to proceed {{on the basis of}} progressive steps, allowingsmaller sub-groups to move faster than the whole group while providing that many decisionsbe made by the majority rather than by consensus. On the other hand, the subsidiarityprinciple provides a clearer basis for distributing powers and responsibilities across severallayers (from national to regional) of the organizational structure of a regional integrationscheme according to the comparative advantage of each in respect of the different functions. These new co-operation arrangements have important contributions to make in helping todevelop African infrastructure and thus in reducing the region’s unusually high transactionscosts, which inhibit trade, investment, and economic growth. They could also play a majorrole by assisting African countries to establish a stable macroeconomic policy environmentthrough regional co-ordination and harmonization of macroeconomic and sectoral policies,trade, and growth- and investment-enhancing institutions. In addition, in an era ofglobalization, the multilateral approach to the fuller integration of African countries into theglobal economy is a sine qua non. To derive the most benefit from this approach, Africancountries must not only participate more actively and effectively in the World TradeOrganization (WTO) process, they also need to accept and implement appropriate tariffbindingobligations. ...|$|R
40|$|In Principles of Political Economy, John Stuart Mill both {{provides}} {{an assessment of}} the workability and desirability of some prominent contemporary forms of socialism, and sketches his own view of how society might be transformed from capitalism into socialism. His assessment of contemporary forms of socialism–particularly Owenite communism, Saint-Simonism and Fourierism–in the main determines, not that the schemes are themselves wholly unworkable, nor that the criticisms socialists level against contemporary capitalism are entirely unwarranted, but that a better solution could be found which would also not involve their potential problems (particularly for the free development of individuality). Co-operative socialism, which avoids these problems, whilst also providing solutions to the problems of capitalism, is far more favourably reviewed. It is true that Mill’s language regarding the transformation of capitalism is possibilistic rather than deterministic or normatively prescriptive (often using “may” rather than, say, “will”), but there are both clues in his work that he thought some of these changes would come about (perhaps so long as dominant class-interest did not actively seek to prevent it), and that it should–after all, Mill describes a similar set of reforms as his “Utopia” and declared that, by the mid- 1840 s, his political philosophy was “under the general designation of Socialist”. Although the Saint-Simonian scheme called for state-wide adoption of socialism, and the Owenite and Fourierist schemes Mill assessed called for small intentional communities, they were linked by their demand for whole-scale adoption of socialism, and, therefore, for total, immediate, root-and-branch reform. Mill’s preferred model of transformation to socialism is piece-meal, peaceful, small-scale, incremental, voluntaristic, organic and grass-roots-led–but his proposed, and favoured, transformation is no-less radical or, in the end, wide-reaching. Although wary of being too prescriptive, the socialist proposals Mill did make, ultimately, call for some state-action, provision and ownership (at both national and local level), alongside agricultural and industrial producer- and consumer-cooperatives, which could be as communal in their living arrangements as members wished, and which would implement just distributions of the surpluses of <b>co-operation</b> according to <b>principles</b> of justice democratically determined by all members. He also envisaged radical reform to the family, to religion, to the social ethos and, ultimately, to human nature itself. This chapter sketches, firstly, Mill’s analysis of capitalism, and, secondly, his preferred road to socialism...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2002. What, if any, is the {{relation}} between Corporate Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility? "Corporate Governance is concerned with holding the balance between economic and social goals and between individual and communal goals. The corporate governance framework is there to encourage the efficient use of resources and equally to require accountability for the stewardship of those resources. The aim is to align as nearly as possible the interests of individuals, corporations and society" (Cadbury, 2000). The World Bank notes, {{that there is no}} single model of corporate governance with systems varying by country, sector and even in the same corporation over time. Among the most prominent systems are the US and UK models, which focus on dispersed controls; and the German and Japanese models which reflect a more concentrated ownership structure. Recently, South Africa's own King Report II on corporate governance is getting more and more international acclaim. Corporate social responsibility is concerned with treating the stakeholders of the firm ethically or in a socially responsible manner. Stakeholders exist both within a firm and outside. Consequently, behaving socially responsibly will increase the human development of stakeholders both within and outside the corporation. For instance the OECD (Organisation for Economic <b>Co-operation</b> and Development) <b>principles</b> imply that a key role for stakeholders is concerned with ensuring the flow of external capital to firms and that stakeholders are protected by law and have access to disclosure (OECD, 1998 : 15). While the World Bank have been intrigued by a June 2000 Investor Opinion Survey of McKinsey (World Bank, 2000) that finds that investors say that board governance is as important as financial performance in their investment decisions and that across Latin America, Europe, the USA and Asia investors (over 80 % of those interviewed) {{would be willing to pay}} more for a company with good board governance practices. "Poor governance" was defined by McKinsey as a company that has: • Minority of outside directors; • Outside directors have financial ties with management; • Directors own little or no stock; • Directors compensated only with cash; • No formal director evaluation process; • Very unresponsive to investor requests for information on governance issues. "Good governance" was defined by McKinsey as: • Majority of outside directors; • Outside directors are truly independent, no management ties; Directors have significant stockholdings; • Large proportion of director pay is stock / options; • Formal director evaluation in place; • Very responsive to investor requests for information on governance issues. In view of the new thinking regarding the function of boards of directors, this mini-thesis will focus particularly on the role of the independent director in corporate governance, with a specific review of the approach in the USA, Europe and South Africa. A proposed role for the independent director will be given, as well as some final conclusions and recommendations on the topic. Without a more complete study it would be immature to think that this paper could have a final say on the role of the independent director in corporate governance, rather it is intended as a stimulus for further research in this very contemporary area...|$|R
