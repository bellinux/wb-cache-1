5|$|Nicole Kidman has {{portrayed the}} life of Rosalind Franklin in a play called Photograph 51 at the Noël Coward Theatre in the City of Westminster which premiered in September 2015. Franklin's <b>colleague</b> <b>at</b> King’s, Maurice Wilkins, was played by Stephen Campbell Moore. The title refers to Photo 51, an x-ray {{crystallography}} image of the DNA double helix structure produced by Franklin and a PhD student in 1952 at King’s College, London.|$|E
5|$|Other names used by Fleming {{included}} a <b>colleague</b> <b>at</b> The Sunday Times, Robert Harling, who {{was transformed into}} Commissioner of Police Harling, whilst an ex-colleague from his stock broking days, Hugo Pitman, became Chief of Immigration Pitman and Fleming's golfing friend, Bunny Roddick, became Deputy Governor Roddick. The title Thunderball came from a conversation Fleming had about a US atomic test.|$|E

5|$|The 1950s and 1960s saw two {{developments}} {{that would affect}} stellar convection theory in red supergiants: the Stratoscope projects and the 1958 publication of Structure and Evolution of the Stars, principally the work of Martin Schwarzschild and his <b>colleague</b> <b>at</b> Princeton University, Richard Härm. This book disseminated {{ideas on how to}} apply computer technologies to create stellar models, while the Stratoscope projects, by taking balloon-borne telescopes above the Earth's turbulence, produced some of the finest images of solar granules and sunspots ever seen, thus confirming the existence of convection in the solar atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Weber's {{thinking}} was {{strongly influenced by}} German idealism and particularly by neo-Kantianism, {{to which he had}} been exposed through Heinrich Rickert, his professorial <b>colleague</b> <b>at</b> the University of Freiburg. Especially important to Weber's work is the neo-Kantian belief that reality is essentially chaotic and incomprehensible, with all rational order deriving from {{the way in which the}} human mind focuses its attention on certain aspects of reality and organises the resulting perceptions. Weber's opinions regarding the methodology of the social sciences show parallels with the work of contemporary neo-Kantian philosopher and pioneering sociologist Georg Simmel.|$|E
5|$|Agârbiceanu visited Bucharest, the Old Kingdom capital, in 1906, {{and sent}} {{enthusiastic}} travel notes for Unirea. He became {{a regular contributor}} to the Bucharest nationalist review Sămănătorul, which gave De la țară a sonorous welcome, and later to Sămănătoruls leftist rival, Viața Românească. From 1909, he {{was also one of the}} regulars at Neamul Românesc. For his literary activity, he was elected a corresponding member of Astra in 1912, and was promoted to full membership in 1925. From 1910 to 1919, he was parish priest at Orlat in Sibiu County. Agârbiceanu was also a member of Austria-Hungary's Romanian National Party (PNR), and supported PNR youth leader Octavian Goga, his <b>colleague</b> <b>at</b> Luceafărul and Tribuna. In 1910, he followed Goga as he parted from the PNR and launched his own independent faction.|$|E

5|$|Marquis' {{interest}} in the West was first sparked in 1890 by stories from three fellow printers who had spent a year there. Marquis and a <b>colleague</b> <b>at</b> the Herald resolved to save for a similar trip, working every shift available. In the end, however, the other printer dropped out and Marquis went alone. He boarded a train for Helena, Montana, on July23, 1890, arriving on the 27th. He soon found temporary work at the Helena Independent-Record. It was in Helena that Marquis first met Native Americans. Perhaps more remarkably, {{it was there that}} he first experienced a Chinese restaurant.|$|E
5|$|Now {{divorced}} from Adam, Christine films Jack {{as he gets}} ready for his first day of school. Left alone in the flat, Christine is comforted by Ernie as she cries. On Hallowe'en of the next year, Christine dresses up with her friend Bobby (Pemberton), a <b>colleague</b> <b>at</b> Clarks. Someone Christine assumes to be Adam enters the flat to pick up Jack. When Adam calls at the door, Christine goes to Jack's room and finds Jack {{in the arms of}} the Stranger. On Bonfire Night, Christine arrives home with Jack, who has burnt his hand. Marion finds that Jack is not injured, but says that Christine was burnt when she was Jack's age.|$|E
5|$|The {{brothers}} hired external help {{to address}} {{two of their}} initial issues: art and audio. Jamie Churchman, a former <b>colleague</b> <b>at</b> Sidhe, oversaw the visual design for Mini Metro and {{also contributed to the}} game design. They approached American composer Disasterpeace to work on the game's audio. He developed a procedural audio system that would generate sounds based on events in the game. Each level in the game has a corresponding set of rhythms and sounds; the harmonic structure of these elements changes based on {{the size and shape of}} the player's subways system. The audio was inspired by minimalism and the works of Philip Glass and Steve Reich.|$|E

5|$|The film {{began as}} a spec script written by Reddick for an episode of The X-Files, in order for Reddick to get a TV agent, however, he never {{submitted}} it to The X-Files after a <b>colleague</b> <b>at</b> New Line Cinema persuaded him to write it as a feature-length film. Later, Wong and Morgan, The X-Files writing partners, {{became interested in the}} script and agreed to rewrite and direct the film, marking Wong's film directing debut. Filming took place in New York City and Vancouver, with additional scenes filmed in Toronto and San Francisco. It was released on March 17, 2000, and became a financial success, making $10 million on its opening weekend. The DVD release of the film, released on September 26, 2000, in the United States and Canada, includes commentaries, deleted scenes, and documentaries.|$|E
5|$|Fleming {{borrowed}} from his surroundings, {{as he had}} done with all his writing up to that point, to include places he had seen. One such location was a motel in the Adirondacks in upstate New York, which Fleming would drive past on the way to Ivar Bryce's Black Hollow Farm; this became the Dreamy Pines Motel. Similarly, he took incidents from his own life and used them in the novel: Vivienne Michel's seduction in a box in the Royalty Kinema, Windsor, mirrors Fleming's loss of virginity in the same establishment. A <b>colleague</b> <b>at</b> The Sunday Times, Robert Harling, gave his name to a printer in the story while another minor character, Frank Donaldson, was named after Jack Donaldson, a friend of Fleming's wife. One of Fleming's neighbours in Jamaica was Vivienne Stuart, whose first name Fleming purloined for the novel's heroine.|$|E
5|$|In 1958 Goffman {{became a}} faculty member in the {{sociology}} department at the University of California, Berkeley, first as a visiting professor, then from 1962 as a full professor. In 1968 {{he moved to the}} University of Pennsylvania, receiving the Benjamin Franklin Chair in Sociology and Anthropology, due largely to the efforts of Dell Hymes, a former <b>colleague</b> <b>at</b> Berkeley. In 1969 he became a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1970 Goffman became a cofounder of the American Association for the Abolition of Involuntary Mental Hospitalization and coauthored its Platform Statement. In 1971 he published Relations in Public, in which he tied together many of his ideas about everyday life, seen from a sociological perspective. Another major book of his, Frame Analysis, came out in 1974. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship for 1977–78. In 1979, Goffman received the Cooley-Mead Award for Distinguished Scholarship, from the Section on Social Psychology of the American Sociological Association. He was elected the 73rd president of the American Sociological Association, serving in 1981–82; he was, however, unable to deliver the presidential address in person due to progressing illness.|$|E

5|$|Many of Oppenheimer's {{associates}} in {{the years}} before World War II were Communist Party USA members. They included his wife Kitty, whose first husband Joe Dallet had been killed fighting with the Lincoln Battalion in the Spanish Civil War; his brother Frank Oppenheimer and Frank's wife Jackie; and his girlfriend Jean Tatlock. One of his Communist associates was a <b>colleague</b> <b>at</b> the University of California, an assistant professor of French literature named Haakon Chevalier. The two had met during a rally for Spanish Loyalists, and had co-founded a branch of the American Federation of Teachers at Berkeley known as Local 349. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had opened a file on Oppenheimer in March 1941, after he had attended a December 1940 meeting at Chevalier's home that was also attended by the Communist Party's California state secretary William Schneiderman and its treasurer Isaac Folkoff, both of whom were targets of FBI surveillance and wiretaps. Agents had recorded the license plate of Oppenheimer's car. The FBI noted that Oppenheimer was on the Executive Committee of the American Civil Liberties Union, which it considered a Communist front. Shortly thereafter, the FBI added Oppenheimer to its Custodial Detention Index, for arrest in case of national emergency.|$|E
