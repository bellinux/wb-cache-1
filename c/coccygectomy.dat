50|$|Following a coccyx fracture, {{surgery is}} not usually required; however, if the pain {{continues}} even after the fracture has healed, and is severe enough to cause disability, a <b>coccygectomy</b> may be required. <b>Coccygectomy</b> is the surgical removal of the coccyx.|$|E
50|$|In humans, a {{major cause}} of perineal hernia is perineal surgery without {{adequate}} reconstruction. In some cases, particularly surgeries to remove the coccyx and distal sacrum, adequate reconstruction is very difficult to achieve. The posterior perineum is a preferred point of access for surgery in the pelvic cavity, particularly in the presacral space. Surgeries here include repair of rectal prolapse and anterior meningocele, radical perineal prostatectomy, removal of tumors including sacrococcygeal teratoma, and <b>coccygectomy.</b> Perineal hernia is a common complication of <b>coccygectomy</b> in adults, but not in infants and children (see <b>coccygectomy).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Injuring the coccyx {{can give}} rise to a painful {{condition}} called coccydynia and {{one or more of the}} bones or the connections thereof may be broken, fractured tailbone. [...] A number of tumors are known to involve the coccyx; of these, the most common is sacrococcygeal teratoma. Both coccydynia and coccygeal tumors may require surgical removal of the coccyx (<b>coccygectomy).</b> One very rare complication of <b>coccygectomy</b> is a type of perineal hernia known as a coccygeal hernia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coccygectomy</b> is a {{surgical}} procedure {{in which the}} coccyx or tailbone is removed. It is considered a required treatment for sacrococcygeal teratoma and other germ cell tumors arising from the coccyx. <b>Coccygectomy</b> is the treatment of last resort for coccydynia (coccyx pain) which has {{failed to respond to}} nonsurgical treatment. Non surgical treatments include use of seat cushions, external or internal manipulation and massage of the coccyx and the attached muscles, medications given by local injections under fluoroscopic guidance, and medications by mouth.|$|E
50|$|In {{adults who}} undergo <b>coccygectomy,</b> one rare {{complication}} is a subsequent perineal hernia or coccygeal hernia. In these hernias, bowel or other pelvic contents bulge downward {{and out of}} the pelvis through a weakened pelvic floor. This complication has not been reported in persons who underwent <b>coccygectomy</b> while a baby or child. A milder version of hernia is when someone just has prolapse (sagging) of the pelvic floor. To repair these hernias, a variety of surgical techniques have been described.|$|E
50|$|Some {{animals are}} {{subjected}} to docking, the amputation of the tailbone {{at or near the}} dock. These include dogs, cats, sheep, pigs, and horses. Humans have a remnant tail, the coccyx, and the human equivalent of docking is <b>coccygectomy.</b>|$|E
50|$|Anismus is a {{paradoxical}} contraction {{of the external}} anal sphincter, when the intent is relaxation, which can result in obstructed defecation and constipation. Abnormal function of this muscle is also seen in anorectal malformation and after certain surgeries, including <b>coccygectomy.</b>|$|E
50|$|If non-surgical {{treatments}} fail {{to relieve}} the pain, or in cases of cancer, surgery to remove the coccyx (<b>coccygectomy)</b> may be required. In cases where pain persists after surgery, standard drugs for chronic pain, such as tri-cyclic anti-depressants, may help alleviate the pain.|$|E
5000|$|In women, the levator muscles {{or their}} {{supplying}} nerves can be damaged in pregnancy or childbirth. There {{is some evidence}} that these muscles may also be damaged during a hysterectomy. Pelvic surgery using the [...] "perineal approach" [...] (between the anus and coccyx) is an established cause of damage to the pelvic floor. This surgery includes <b>coccygectomy.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{with any}} {{operation}} under anaesthetic, {{there are risks}} associated with general anaesthesia itself. An additional possible complication of <b>coccygectomy</b> is infection at the surgical site, due to the site's proximity to the anus, leading to contamination by bacteria from the patient's feces. An analysis of 24 studies of <b>coccygectomy</b> (covering 702 patients) reported that 19 studies (covering 493 patients) reported the post-surgery infection rate, while the other five studies gave incomplete information. Among the patients in the 19 studies with full information, the infection rate was 12%. In most cases the infection was superficial, but 4% of operations caused an infection that required repeat surgery to treat the infection. However, the use of prophylactic antibiotics, preoperative rectal enema, closure of the wound in two layers and use of a topical skin adhesive {{have been shown to}} reduce the rate of infection to 0%.|$|E
50|$|The <b>coccygectomy</b> {{operation}} had a poor {{reputation in}} the past, and some doctors still advise that the surgery should be avoided. However current data from clinical trials reports success rates of 50 up to 90%, a percentage that rises to 80-90% in patients that {{are considered to be}} 'good candidates' for this kind of surgery. A study that was published in 2001 covering a total of 702 patients found good or excellent results in 83% of cases.|$|E
50|$|SCTs {{are very}} rare in adults, {{and as a}} rule these tumors are benign and have {{extremely}} low potential for malignancy. This estimation of potential {{is based on the}} idea that because the tumor existed for decades prior to diagnosis, without becoming malignant, it has little or no potential to ever become malignant. For this reason, and because <b>coccygectomy</b> in adults has greater risks than in babies, some surgeons prefer not to remove the coccyx of adult survivors of SCT. There are case reports of good outcomes.|$|E
30|$|Adding <b>coccygectomy</b> to the {{resection}} of congenital presacral tumors remains controversial. Traditional {{treatment of}} sacrococcygeal teratomas favors removing the coccyx because the totipotential cells {{are believed to}} arise from the coccyx [13]. However, complications associated with <b>coccygectomy</b> include delayed wound healing, increased wound infection rate, prolonged recovery time, and rarely, bowel herniation. Thus, in recent case reports, <b>coccygectomy</b> was sometimes omitted when the presacral tumor was located away from the coccyx [12, 14, 15]. In our case, resection of the coccyx was performed in order to expose and resect the tumor via the posterior approach.|$|E
40|$|Objective: A {{review of}} the {{literature}} on <b>coccygectomy</b> and our patients was performed to assess the effectiveness of coccy-gectomy for chronic refractory coccygodynia. Methods: An English language PubMed search was conducted with the terms ‘‘coccygodynia’ ’ and ‘ ‘ coccygectomy’ ’ from January 1980 to January 2012. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and performed telephone questionnaire on 61 patients who underwent <b>coccygectomy</b> at UCDMC between 1997 and 2009. Results: There were 28 case series from 1980 to 2012 for a total of 742 patients who underwent <b>coccygectomy</b> following failed conservative management. The mean age ranged from 26. 4 to 52. 8 years. The most common cause was direct trauma (58. 5 %) with a male:female ratio of 1 : 5. 2. Most patients (84 %) had a good to excellent outcome after <b>coccygectomy.</b> The most common complication is wound infection (10. 0 %). The overall complication rate was 13. 3 %. Similarly, 84. 6 % of patients from our own surgical case series reported good to excellent outcomes with 11. 5 % wound infection. Conclusion: <b>Coccygectomy</b> is an effective treatment for chronic refractory coccygodynia. The surgery isrelatively simple to perform but precaution must be taken to avoid wound infection...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{report the}} middle term results of partial <b>coccygectomy</b> in a {{consecutive}} series of 15 {{patients with chronic}} coccygodynia. METHODS: Fifteen patients with chronic coccygodynia were referred to our outpatient clinics. The patients were investigated with dynamic lateral radiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We diagnosed a posttraumatic coccygodynia with instability of the coccygeal segment and performed a partial <b>coccygectomy</b> after failure of the conservative treatment. RESULTS: All patients underwent subjective and objective assessment after a mean time of 2. 8 years from surgery. There were 11 excellent, 3 good, and 1 fair results. The mean time of improvement was 15 weeks, and no further improvement was observed after 6 months. CONCLUSION: Partial <b>coccygectomy</b> is a good therapeutic option for posttraumatic coccygodynia. Dynamic radiography is a useful tool to differentiate posttraumatic from idiopathic coccygodynia.

40|$|Sacrococcygeal hernia {{consists}} of the protrusion of abdominal and pelvic structures through the sacrococcygeal region, an uncommom complication of <b>coccygectomy</b> and sacral <b>coccygectomy.</b> Its surgical treatment is based on perineal hernia repair, by means of abdominal, perineal or abdominoperineal access.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{clinical}} outcomes and wound complications in <b>coccygectomy</b> with or without subperiosteal resection. This retrospective study included 25 patients who underwent <b>coccygectomy.</b> Resection of all mobile coccygeal segments including the periosteum was performed in 11 patients (group 1) and resection was performed subperiostally sparing the periosteum in the remaining 14 patients (group 2). A visual analogue scale was used for pain assessment before and after the surgery both in sitting and standing positions. A questionnaire to evaluate subjective patient satisfaction was also used. The two groups were statistically similar in terms of age, sex, aetiology, duration of symptoms before surgery and follow-up time. Both surgical techniques resulted in a statistically similar clinical outcome. Overall, 84 % of patients who underwent <b>coccygectomy</b> benefited from surgery. We observed four wound infections (two superficial and two deep) that caused delayed wound healing in group 1. The rate of infection in group 1 was statistically higher than in group 2.

40|$|Background The {{majority}} of the cases of coccydynia occur in conjunction with either subluxated or hypermobile coccyx, {{and it has been}} proposed that this pathologic instability may cause chronic inflammatory changes. Objectives This study was done to evaluate the effect of <b>coccygectomy</b> in patients with resistant coccydynia after initial conservative therapy failure. Patients and Methods Between October 2010 and December 2013, 13 patients with coccydynia underwent <b>coccygectomy</b> in the hospitals of Ahvaz city after a failed conservative therapy for at least 4 - 6 months. In order to evaluate the results, a questionnaire was obtained, including the extent of relief in the painful area, improvement in quality of life, intensity of pain in the sitting position, pain during daily activities, and the need for analgesics, according to the criteria described by Bayne. Results The patients were followed up for an average of 25. 7 months. The results were good in 11 patients, excellent in 1, and fair in only 1 patient.

40|$|Coccygodynia is a {{pathological}} condition associated with pain–discomfort {{all around the}} bottom end of the spine. The aetiology {{and the intensity of}} the symptoms may defer significantly. The effectiveness of the surgical treatment remains obscure. Our purpose, through this systematic review is to evaluate the results of surgical treatment of <b>coccygectomy.</b> Literature retrieval was performed by the use of the PubMed searching engine utilising the terms ‘coccygodynia–coccygectomy’ in the English language from January 1980 to January 2010. Case reports and tumour related case series were excluded as well as articles published in other languages. In total 24 manuscripts were analyzed. Only 2 of them were prospective studies whereas 22 were retrospective case series; five were classified as Level III studies and the remaining as Level IV studies. In total, 671 patients with coccygodynia underwent <b>coccygectomy</b> following failed conservative management. The sex ratio, male/female was 1 : 4. 4.

40|$|AbstractCoccygeal {{herniation}} after <b>coccygectomy</b> is rare. Little {{is known}} about the management of this complication. We present a case of a 44 year old women with a coccygeal herniation 7 years after <b>coccygectomy.</b> She was treated two times for an infected pilonidal sinus with incision and drainage. After the last incision and drainage she had complaints of a painful swelling in the sacral area and difficulty with evacuation of her stools. A defaecography showed a coccygeal herniation. An additional MRI of the pelvic region showed a defect with a diameter of approximately 38 mm. We performed a hernia repair with a biological mesh (Strattice™ surgical mesh, LifeCell Corporation USA) via a sacral approach. Her recovery was complicated by a small wound dehiscence without clinical signs of infection. The sacral wound healed per secundam. Her complaints had completely disappeared.

Patients and methods: The study included 22 patients (from a total of 27) who underwent partial or total <b>coccygectomy</b> because of persistent coccydynia between December 2007 and January 2014. There were 15 females and 7 males with a mean age of 33. 6 years (range 23 – 46 years). Partial <b>coccygectomy</b> was performed in 14 patients and total <b>coccygectomy</b> in 8. They were evaluated according to their pre- and postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores. The mean follow-up period was 28 months (range 16 – 48 months). Results: The mean VAS scores in the total excision group were 8. 88 ± 0. 64 preoperatively and 2. 5 ± 2. 67 at the final postoperative follow-up examination. In the partial excision group, these values were 8. 79 ± 0. 89 preoperatively and 2. 5 ± 2. 85 postoperatively. No statistically significant difference was determined between the two groups with respect to the mean scores (p> 0. 05). No rectum injury was seen in any patient. When the VAS scores of the patients were evaluated as a whole, excellent and good results were obtained in 78 %. Patient satisfaction with the operation was 90 %.

30|$|A painful coccyx is {{a common}} {{complaint}} in women due to the posterior prominence of the coccyx anatomically in the female pelvis, meaning that it is exposed to multiple traumas. However, physicians should also consider atypical conditions such as tuberculosis in patients presenting with coccygodynia, especially those who are refractory to treatment with conservative measures, and in association with HIV. Most sacral and sacrococcygeal lesions heal with adequate local support and antitubercular therapy, but <b>coccygectomy</b> may be essential in refractory cases.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the fluoroscopic guided injection, local injection, conservative treatment and surgery in managing coccygodynia. Methods: Fifty chronic coccygodynia patients were evaluated. All patients complained of pain while sitting and had tenderness localized to the coccyx. All patients were offered conservative management initially, {{then they were}} assigned into four groups: 5 patients underwent <b>coccygectomy,</b> 22 patients had fluoroscopic guided injection, 11 patients had local injection, and 12 patients were treated only conservatively. Patients’ satisfaction with treatment was assessed by a visual analog scale (VAS). The follow-up period ranged from 7 to 32  months (mean 17. 3  months). Results: The initial conservative therapy had the lowest improvement rate (7 / 50, 14 %). All patients subjected to <b>coccygectomy</b> or fluoroscopic guided injections improved and were satisfied. Nine patients of the local injection group (9 / 11, 82 %) improved and 2 patients (18 %) were stationary.

40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} long-term outcomes of sacrococcygeal germ cell tumors (SC-GCTs) over a 15 -year period. Materials and Methods. A retrospective review was conducted of all pediatric patients treated for SC-GCTs at our hospital from 1998 to 2012. Results. Fifty-seven patients were treated for SC-GCTs with the most common in Altman’s classification type I. Age at surgery ranged from one day to 5. 6 years. Tumor resection and <b>coccygectomy</b> were primarily performed in about 84 % of the cases. Pathology revealed mature, immature, malignant sacrococcygeal teratomas (SCTs), and endodermal sinus tumors (ESTs) in 41 (72 %), 4 (77 %), 6 (10. 5 %), and 6 (10. 5 %), respectively. Recurrence of discase occurred in 3 of 41 patients with mature teratomas (7. 3 %); 2 recurrences with mature teratomas and one recurrence with EST. Five of 6 malignant SCTs and 3 of 6 ESTs responded well to the treatment. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was elevated in both malignant teratomas and ESTs. No immediate patient death was noted in any of the 57 cases, but 4 patients with malignant tumors and distant metastasis succumbed at home within 2 years of the initial treatment. Conclusion. Benign SCTs have a significant recurrence rate of approximately 7 %. Close follow-up with serial AFP level monitoring should be done for 5 years after initial tumor resection and <b>coccygectomy.</b> The survival rate for malignant SC-GCTs with distant metastasis was unfavorable in the present study...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Coccydynia is a {{term that}} refers to pain {{in the region of}} the coccyx. Most cases are {{associated}} with abnormal mobility of the coccyx which may trigger a chronic inflam-matory process leading to degeneration of this structure. In some patients this instability may be detected on dynamic radiographs. Nonsurgical management remains the gold stan-dard treatment for coccydynia, consisting of decreased sitting, seat cushioning, coccygeal massage, stretching, manipulation, local injection of steroids or anesthetics, and postural adjust-ments. Those patients who fail these conservative modalities may potentially benefit from <b>coccygectomy.</b> However, surgi-cal intervention is typically reserved for patients with evidence of advanced coccygeal instability (e. g., subluxation or hyper-mobility) or spicule formation, as this population appears to exhibit the greatest improvement postoperatively...|$|E
