The United States is a signatory of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantees residents of its signatories wide-ranging rights to enter or depart their own countries. In Nguyen v. INS, the Supreme Court stated that U.S. citizens are entitled [...] "...to the absolute right to enter its borders." [...] Lower federal courts went as far as to declare that [...] "...the Government cannot say to its citizen, standing beyond its border, that his reentry into the land of his allegiance is a criminal offense; and this we conclude is a sound principle whether or not the citizen has a passport, and however wrongful may have been his conduct in effecting his departure." [...] Therefore, U.S. border control facilities don't deny U.S. citizens entry even in the absence of a valid passport, though these travelers may be delayed while the CBP attempts to verify their identity and citizenship status. The U.S. does not exercise passport control on exit from the country, so the individual attempting to depart from the U.S. only needs to have valid documents granting him/her right to entry into the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background Earlier {{studies using}} a double {{perspective}} (destination & origin) indicate that several macro-characteristics <b>of</b> both <b>destination</b> and origin countries affect the educational performance of migrant children. This paper explores {{the extent to}} which educational system features <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> and origin <b>countries</b> can explain these differences in educational achievement of migrant children, next to these macro-characteristics. Methods Using data from the 2006 PISA survey, we performed cross-classified multilevel analysis on the science performance of 9. 279 15 -year-old migrant children, originating from 35 different countries, living in 16 Western <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination.</b> We take into account a number of educational system characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> and origin, in order to measure the importance of differentiation, standardization, and the availability of resources. Results We show that differences in educational achievement between migrants cannot be fully attributed to individual characteristics or macro-characteristics. Educational system characteristics <b>of</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> and origin are also meaningful. At the origin level, the length of compulsory education positively influences educational performance. This is especially the case for migrant pupils who attended education in their <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> origin. We show also that at the destination level, a high student-teacher ratio in primary education positively affects migrant pupil’s scientific performance. Moreover, migrant children with low educated parents do not perform less in highly stratified systems and even perform better in moderately differentiated systems than they do in comprehensive one. But migrant children with highly educated parents perform worse in highly and moderately stratified systems. Conclusion This study underscores the importance of educational system features as an explanation of differences in educational achievement across different origin groups and across migrants living in different destination countries. Although individual level characteristics account for the largest educational achievement differences, educational system characteristics have an effect on top of these individual level characteristics and the average educational performance in their <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> origin. Differences in educational systems contribute to explaining the effects of economic and political macro-characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> origin on the educational performance of migrant children in destination countries...|$|R

I examine the ability of two theories of regime formation (structural and game-theoretic approaches) and of two theories of integration (supranationalism and intergovernmentalism) to account for such cooperation. Based on a review of attempts to promote cooperation at the regional and inter-regional levels, and on a more detailed analysis of two case studies (the EU and ECOWAS), I demonstrate {{that none of the}} four theories adequately explains how multilateral cooperation with regards to the free movement of labor emerges. I then offer an alternative model, which highlights bargaining between the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> origin and those <b>of</b> <b>destination.</b> I assert that <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> origin are likely to support the free movement <b>of</b> labor, while <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> are likely to oppose it. Multilateral cooperation is achieved when the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> agree to the free movement of labor, and in return, the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> origin grant the former unrestricted entry into their markets, and/or accept their leadership status. This kind of cross-issue linkage mainly develops in regional integration schemes.
