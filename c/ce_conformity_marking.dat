In line with the Association Council Decisions n ° 1 / 95 and 2 / 97, a Framework Law relating to the preparation and implementation of the technical legislation regarding products has entered into force on 11 January 2002. The Law was adopted by the Parliament on 29. 06. 2001 and published in the Official Gazette on 11 July 2001. This Framework Law establishes the legal basis for full harmonisation with the EC legislation, and it lays down the basic principles for product safety and the implementation of Old and New Approach Directives. It sets out the conditions of the placing on the market of the products, the liabilities of the producers and distributors, the conformity assessment bodies, notified bodies, market surveillance and inspection, the prohibition of the placing on the market of certain products, the withdrawal and destruction of the marketed products as well as the notifications relating to these arrangements.

40|$|This article {{describes}} comparative testing of thermal conductivity {{on a range}} of thermal insulation products used in the construction of buildings. This testing was arranged by the CEN Keymark scheme for voluntary certification of insulation within Europe, and measurements have been performed using over 50 instruments in more than 25 registered laboratories. The uniformity of the material and a unique thermal conductivity value for each set of test specimens that were used in the comparison have been established according to the Keymark scheme rules, which were developed by experts from the most respected European laboratories. These experts include most of the laboratories responsible for characterizing the European certified reference material (IRMM 440) for thermal conductivity measurements on thermal insulation products (Quin, Venuti, De Ponte, 2 ̆ 6 Lamberty, 2000). The sets of test specimens that have been characterized by the expert group were circulated and measured by the laboratories registered within the Keymark scheme, and the results are presented in this article and compared to the results of the first comparative testing in the Keymark scheme carried out up to August 2003 and presented at ITCC 27 (Rasmussen 2 ̆ 6 ITCC 27 Paper, 2003). The voluntary Keymark scheme works alongside the mandatory <b>CE</b> <b>conformity</b> <b>mark</b> (<b>CE</b> mark) used within the European Union and includes rigorous auditing and assessment of measurement capability, which provides a high level of confidence in measured thermal conductivity values produced by registered laboratories.

40|$|Abstract — The next {{revision}} of the R&TTE Directive, which represents the basic regulatory framework for wireless communication in Europe, {{is expected to be}} finalized in 2011. In particular, this new revision is expected to provide a novel framework for reconfigurable radio devices, for example building on Software Defined Radio features. Those devices may maintain one or multiple links to heterogeneous radio access technologies simultaneously. Also, new features may be added after the sale of the device via software download, such as the addition of a new radio access technology to selected mobile devices. This addition of new features to a device that is already on the market is obviously challenging from a certification perspective. For this purpose, this paper proposes novel approaches for updating certificates building on the novel concepts of dynamic Declaration of <b>Conformity,</b> <b>CE</b> <b>Marking</b> and Alert Symbol marking as they are discussed for example in ETSI Reconfigurable Radio Systems (ETSI RRS) standardization.

The research work carried out focuses on the development of a procedure for the definition of the products' ecological profile (EP), making the control and management of their environmental performances affordable also for non-experts. The proposed methodology, named Life Cycle Compliance for Ecodesign (LCCE), allows engineers to evaluate the product's eco-virtuosity, i. e. the environmental improvements over mandatory requisites, taking into account the whole product's life cycle. The methodology was developed throughout the collaboration with manufacturers of different types of products. Results obtained showed that the LCCE methodology resulted in being an easy-to-use ecodesign tool, able not only to manage the conformity of products but also to define the limit of environmental improvements which can be foreseen for the product (i. e. the value over which it is more convenient to re-think the product and its life cycle, rather than upgrading it). © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{made by the}} PhD candidate Francesca Pontis {{focuses on}} the analytical study of criminal issues in the product damages liability and especially on the connection between this question and the principle of guilt as capital principle of criminal law. The interest for this matter comes from the always stronger consideration of our society as a “society of risk”, in which the product damage is the best exemplification of how the fundamental interests are exposed to constant dangers and the classical criminal law institutes are in crisis. In this specific case is really interesting {{the issue of the}} subjective charge of the event, that testifies the metamorphosis of the subjective element of negligence in the post-modern society, from being an exception to become a consolidated rule. Furthermore the analysis conducted concentrates on the model of the criminal offences connected to production, distribution and use of defective products {{as an example of the}} always more detailed configuration of the criminal negligence as a prevalent collective offence, synchronic or diachronic, conscious or unconscious. The PhD candidate especially points out how in the industrial production, medical surgery, vehicles circulation and in other so called “first aid activities” is often hard to correlate, by a trial certain beyond all reasonable doubts, a certain damaging event to a certain behaviour, chargeable to easily identifiable people, with a consequent risk of survival in the juridical system of the classical criminal law principle of personality of the criminal liability, enforced by art. 27, co. 1 of the Italian Constitution. Starting from the analysis of this principle, as a leit motiv of the whole project, it was possible to determinate the aim of the study on the research of the best charging criteria of criminal negligence in case of a collective contribution to the damaging event. Against the backdrop of these guidelines, the research is divided into three fundamental parts. The first part is dedicated to presenting the object of the study and starts by criminal negligence’s analysis both in its general dimension and in its collective shape. The second part concentrated itself on the product damages liability as a collective contribution to the damaging event connected to the uncertain production, distribution and use of products risks, while the third part looks at the specific case of medical devices damages liability in order to underline when and why surgeon will be find guilty of patient’s death, with a special attention given to the case in which defective device had <b>CE</b> <b>conformity</b> certificate...|$|R

40|$|In 2000, the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) {{proposed}} {{the creation of}} a new European certified reference material for the thermal conductivity measurements IRMM- 440. A specific production batch of high density (64 – 78 kg/m 3) resin-bonded glass fiber boards was manufactured and characterized by a group of six leading European laboratories with long-standing expertise in thermal conductivity measurements, including four national measurements institutes. The IRMM- 440 has since been used as the European certified reference material for thermal conductivity measurements on thermal insulation covering temperatures between – 10 °C and 50 °C, and most frequently to calibrate Heat Flow Meter apparatus making measurements at 10 °C. The aim of this article is to present an international interlaboratory comparison of thermal conductivity measurements made on IRMM- 440 at temperatures between – 170 °C and 20 °C. This is the first step to define an insulation reference material for low temperature applications. Indeed, there is currently no reference material available with certified thermal conductivity values for temperatures below – 10 °C. Furthermore, a legal requirement for European <b>conformity</b> <b>marking</b> (<b>CE)</b> was introduced in the European Economic Area in August 2012 for thermal insulation products intended for use in building equipment and industrial installations. The manufacturers of these products are required to declare a “curve” of thermal conductivity against temperature for the whole temperature range at which the product is intended to be used. The values used to produce these “curves” need to be verified by an independent notified laboratory. The data presented in this article comes from a report from the European Commission (2015) : “Certification of a Resin-Bonded Glass Fibre Board for Thermal Conductivity between – 10 ºC and 50 ºC, IRMM- 440 ” (European Commission, 2000), which gives the thermal conductivity values of Dipartimento di Fisica Tecnica (DFT) from Italy.

40|$|Purpose – This study aims to give {{an account}} of how {{stakeholders}} in one NHS Hospital Trust responded to the clinical governance initiative, the effects on quality improvement and the practical accomplishment of legitimacy. Design/methodology/approach – Sociological new institutionalism theory was utilised to explain the political and ceremonial <b>conformity</b> that <b>marked</b> the clinical governance process. A case study was employed using ethnographic methods. The qualitative data were obtained by documentary analysis, observation of meetings and ward activity and 28 semi-structured interviews. A grounded theory approach was adopted in the analysis of the interviews. Findings – Errors and inconsistencies were found in Trust documentation and reporting systems were poor. In practice clinical governance was inadequately understood and the corporate goals not shared. Nevertheless, during the same period the Trust obtained recognition for having appropriate structures and systems in place resulting in external legitimacy. Research limitations/implications – The results only relate to the Trust considered but the study has identified that, although the organization responded to isomorphic governmental pressures in the production of appropriate institutional documentation, the impact of clinical governance to improve the quality in practice was found to be inconsistent. Practical implications – The Trust promoted and endorsed clinical governance success but the lack of organizational processes and knowledge management equally promoted its failure by denying the resources to implement the desired actions. Originality/value – Whilst the study identified that clinical governance had been a “ceremonial success”, it is argued that the practical accomplishment in the improvement of quality of care for patients will remain a paper exercise until organizational and practice issues are addressed.

The thickness of the test specimen was 4. 0 mm, 7. 0 mm, 9. 0 mm, 12. 0 mm and 15. 0 mm. The experiment found that the MOR of red seraya plywood in EN 310 is about 12 % to 20 % and 7 % to 24 % higher than EN 789 whereas MOE were about 28 % to 41 % and 30 % to 36 % lower than those obtained from EN 789 for test specimens parallel and {{perpendicular to the grain}} direction. The linear regression shows that MOR and MOE for EN 789 is about 0. 8 times less and 1. 5 times more than EN 310. The experiment also found that the MOR and MOE of EN 310 and EN 789 also depend on the wood species that used in the experiment.

40|$|Galactic {{conformity}} is {{the phenomenon}} whereby galaxy properties exhibit larger correlations across distance than {{what would be}} expected if these properties only depended on halo mass. We perform a comprehensive study of conformity at low redshift using a galaxy group catalogue from the SDSS DR 7 spectroscopic sample. We study correlations both between central galaxies and their satellites (1 -halo conformity), and between central galaxies in separate haloes (2 -halo conformity). We use two statistics, quenched fractions and the marked correlation function, to probe for conformity in three galaxy properties, (g-r) colour, specific star formation rate, and Sérsic index. We assess the statistical significance of conformity signals with a suite of mock galaxy catalogues that have no built-in conformity, but contain the same group-finding and mass assignment errors as the real data. In the case of 1 -halo conformity, quenched fractions show strong signals at all group masses. However, these signals are equally strong in our mock catalogues, indicating that the conformity signal is spurious and likely entirely caused by systematic errors from group-finding. This result calls into question previous claims of 1 -halo <b>conformity</b> detection. The <b>marked</b> correlation function reveals a significant detection of radial segregation within massive groups, but no evidence of conformity. In the case of 2 -halo conformity, quenched fractions show no significant evidence of conformity once compared with our mock catalogues, in agreement with recent studies that have {{cast doubt on the}} validity of past detections. In contrast, the marked correlation function reveals a highly significant signal in low mass groups for scales of 0. 8 - 4 h^- 1 Mpc, possibly representing the first robust detection of 2 -halo conformity.

Group comparisons were made using x 2 and Student’s t-test statistics. Time series analysis involved multiple linear regression analysis. Results: The major study involved antibiotics and analgesic drugs and dosages in appendectomy in children. Significant improvements occurred in the selection and dosages of prophylactic antibiotics @< 0. 001) and in subsequent ward antibiotic treatments @< 0. 001) also showed <b>marked</b> <b>conformity</b> with the guidelines Other pediatric studies involved liquid medication dosing and prescribing accuracy for paracetamol in a developing country where a simple intervention produced very marked improvements @< 0. 001). An intervention in severe community-acquired pneumonia showed an improvement in the prescription of appropriate drugs @< 0. 001) and appropriate dosages of paracetamol (p<O. OOl) according to the guidelines. In drug utilisation evaluation of cefiriaxone, flucloxacillin and Liquigesic COB, {{there was a significant}} improvement in the dosage prescribing of ceftriaxone and flucloxacillin and no change in Liquigesic COB following the intervention. O f the total, 38 / 218 (17 %) o f the patients received appropriate post-operative antibiotic dosages. 286 / 368 (78 %) of the analgesic prescriptions and 31 / 218 (14 %) of the patients on postoperative antibiotic choice and dosage that were identified as appropriate in tonsillectomy. Conclusion: This study has identified deficiencies related to the prescribing of antibiotics and analgesics in children. There was a varied level of improvement in the drug dosage prescribing of pediatricians following the pharmacist educational intervention. Locally developed guidelines {{are more likely to be}} accepted and followed than those developed nationally without local input...|$|R
