30|$|PET waste can be {{recycled}} {{in many ways}} including chemical and mechanical methods. Hopewell (Hopewell et al. 2009) has summarized various terminologies used for plastic recycling. The primary recycling method is re-extrusion, the classical method of recycling PET. This method involves recycling of scrap materials to form original products. However, because various polymers and other materials such as paper, <b>pigments,</b> <b>metals,</b> and adhesives are used as plastic packing materials, this makes recycling by this method difficult. Although this method has the advantages of simplicity and low cost, {{it is not a}} popular method that requires uncontaminated scrap with only a single type of waste.|$|R

50|$|Encaustic painting, {{also known}} as hot wax painting, {{involves}} using heated beeswax to which colored pigments are added. The liquid/paste is then applied to a surface—usually prepared wood, though canvas and other materials are often used. The simplest encaustic mixture {{can be made from}} adding pigments to beeswax, but there are several other recipes that can be used—some containing other types of waxes, damar resin, linseed oil, or other ingredients. Pure, powdered pigments can be purchased and used, though some mixtures use oil paints or other forms of <b>pigment.</b> <b>Metal</b> tools and special brushes can be used to shape the paint before it cools, or heated metal tools can be used to manipulate the wax once it has cooled onto the surface. Other materials can be encased or collaged into the surface, or layered, using the encaustic medium to adhere it to the surface.|$|R
40|$|Contamination {{of water}} by toxic heavy metals through the {{discharge}} of industrial wastewater is a worldwide environmental problem. Heavy metals form complexes or "ligands" with organic compounds. These modified biological molecules lose their ability to function properly, and result in malfunction or death of the affected cells. Cadmium has many uses, including batteries, <b>pigments,</b> <b>metal</b> coatings, and plastics. Cadmium and several cadmium-containing compounds are known carcinogens and can induce many types of cancer. Long-term exposure to lower levels of cadmium in air, food, or water leads to kidney disease. Other long-term effects are lung damage and fragile bones. Awareness of these effects has led to introduction of more strict legislations to control water pollution. Among the various techniques available to remove metal ions from water, adsorption {{is found to be}} an effective method. Over the last few years number of investigations has been carried out to test natural low cost adsorbents for heavy metal ion removal (Wan Ngah and Hanafiah (2007) ...|$|R

40|$|Cadmium {{is a major}} {{environmental}} toxicant that is released into the atmosphere, water and soil {{in the form of}} cadmium oxide, cadmium chloride, or cadmium sulfide via industrial activities, such as the manufacturing of batteries and <b>pigments,</b> <b>metal</b> smelting and refining and municipal waste incineration. In the present study, we investigated the effects of cadmium exposure on sperm quality parameters, fertilization capacity and early embryonic development. Our study showed that in vitro incubation of human or mouse sperms with cadmium for a long time (up to 24 hours) could significantly decreased sperm motility in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Exposure to cadmium in the environment for a short term (30 min) did not affect sperm motility but significantly reduced in vitro fertilization rate. We also evaluated the effects of cadmium at concentrations of 0. 625 μg/ml, and 1. 25 μg/ml on early embryonic development in vitro and observed that the blastocyst formation rate dramatically decreased with increasing cadmium concentration. This finding emphasizes the hazardous effects of cadmium on sperm quality as well as on natural embryo development and raises greater concerns regarding cadmium pollution...|$|R

40|$|Selected {{contributions}} {{in the fields of}} iron oxide, metal and CrO 2 magnetic pigments are presented. Several wet chemical synthesis of undoped and cobalt bulk doped isometric Fe 3 O 4 -particles from Fe(OH) 2 and iron(III) compounds are compared with regard to the influence of composition and geometrical dimensions of the ferric coreactant on the particle size and the magnetic properties of the product. Oxidation of cobalt bulk doped magnetite particles leads to pigments with multiaxial magnetic behaviour. The structure of passivation layers on <b>metal</b> <b>pigments</b> is analyzed by using different techniques. Thicknesses of 4 - 5 nm are measured 0. 5 to 1 nm of which are due to surface coatings with phosphate compounds which are used to prevent sintering of the particles. Several reduction methods for the preparation of elongated <b>metal</b> <b>pigment</b> are compared. Details of the reaction mechanism of the hydrothermal synthesis of needle shaped CrO 2 in the presence of antimony are discussed. CrO 2 pigments qualitatively show the same behaviour with regard to the dependence of coercivity on particle size as described earlier for other materials. Maximum coercivity of 60 kA/m for Sb-Fe-doped CrO 2 is obtained with crystallite sizes (220) of 23 nm. Chemically stabilized CrO 2 pigments are protected by layers of 0. 7 to 1. 3 nm thickness only. For use in magnetic recording media both, <b>metal</b> <b>pigment</b> and Cr 2 O 2 can thus be described by a core-shell-structure...|$|R
30|$|Since {{the dawn}} of industrialization, water {{pollution}} is a critical environmental issue as the industrial wastewater containing various pollutants is directly or indirectly released into the water bodies that undoubtedly interrupt the aquatic biota. Among the various pollutants such as organic or inorganic chemicals, dyes and pesticides, heavy metals in wastewater {{play a crucial role}} due to their toxic and carcinogenic nature (Sen et al. 2017). Furthermore, they cannot be biodegraded rather bioaccumulated in the living body causing serious health hazards and even death (Tangahu et al. 2011). The atomic weights of heavy metals vary between 63.5 and 200.6, and their specific gravities are five times higher than that of water (Shanab et al. 2012). Chromium is commonly found in wastewater of tannery, textile, paint, ink, aluminum, galvanometry and electric, dyes and <b>pigments,</b> <b>metal</b> cleaning, plating and electroplating, film and photography, mining, leather industries, and its concentration can range from tens to hundreds of mg/L (Han et al. 2008). Cr(III) and Cr(VI) are the most stable form of chromium (Gupta and Rastogi 2009). Though Cr(III) is used as an important nutrient to animals, the toxicity of Cr(VI) is near about 300 times more than Cr(III) because of its profound carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects (Qu et al. 2014). Adverse health effects of chromium depend on its dose, exposure duration and the nature of compound. As per World Health Organization (WHO), the maximum allowable limit of hexavalent chromium is 0.05  mg/L in drinking water (Gupta and Rastogi 2009). Thus, chromium removal from wastewater is mandatory before releasing into the environment.|$|R
40|$|In 1998, {{approximately}} 57, 000 tons of titanium metal {{was consumed}} {{in the form of}} mill products (1). Only about 5 % of the 4 million tons of titanium minerals consumed each year is used to produce titanium metal, with the remainder primarily used to produce titanium dioxide <b>pigment.</b> Titanium <b>metal</b> production is primarily based on the direct chlorination of rutile to produce titanium tetrachloride, which is then reduced to metal using the Kroll magnesium reduction process. The use of titanium is tied to its high strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance. Aerospace is the largest application for titanium, and titanium cost has prevented its use in non-aerospace applications including the automotive and heavy vehicle industries...|$|R
