5|$|The PHEBUS {{experiment}} {{was designed by}} CESR (Toulouse) to record high energy transient events in the range 100keV to 100MeV. It consisted of two independent detectors and their associated electronics. Each detector consisted of a bismuth germanate (BGO) crystal 78mm in diameter by 120mm thick, surrounded by a plastic anti-coincidence jacket. The two detectors were arranged on the spacecraft so as to observe 4π steradians. The burst mode was triggered when the <b>count</b> <b>rate</b> in the 0.1 to 1.5MeV energy range exceeded the background level by 8 sigma in either 0.25 or 1.0 seconds. There were 116 energy channels.|$|E
5|$|The KONUS-B instrument, {{designed}} by the Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute in St. Petersburg, consisted of seven detectors distributed around the spacecraft that responded to photons of 10keV to 8MeV energy. They consisted of NaI(Tl) scintillator crystals 200mm in diameter by 50mm thick behind a Be entrance window. The side surfaces were protected by a 5mm thick lead layer. The burst detection threshold was 500 to 50 microjoules per square meter (510 to 510 erg/cm²), depending on the burst spectrum and rise time. Spectra were taken in two 31-channel pulse height analyzers (PHAs), of which the first eight were measured with 1/16s time resolution and the remaining with variable time resolutions depending on the <b>count</b> <b>rate.</b> The range of resolutions covered 0.25 to 8s.|$|E
25|$|The Geiger counter was the {{original}} radiation detector, recording the total <b>count</b> <b>rate</b> from all energy levels of radiation. Ionization chambers and Geiger counters were first adapted for field use in the 1930s. The first transportable Geiger–Müller counter (weighing 25kg) was constructed at the University of British Columbia in 1932. H.V. Ellsworth of the GSC built a lighter weight, more practical unit in 1934. Subsequent models were the principal instruments used for uranium prospecting for many years, until geiger counters were replaced by scintillation counters.|$|E
30|$|A similar {{procedure}} {{as described}} in methods A and B was followed to determine the DT values for primary photons only. First, the true and observed <b>count</b> <b>rates,</b> {{for each of the}} six energy windows, were determined (method B). The observed <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> were measured experimentally, while the true <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> for each energy window were calculated using Eq. 1 and the corresponding value of τ (determined in Method B). Alternatively, the true <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> can be estimated by extrapolation, as in method B. Next, these observed and true <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> were separately entered into Eq. 2 to determine the observed and the true scatter components. Finally, the observed and the true primary photons <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> were estimated using Eq. 3.|$|R
40|$|An {{artificial}} {{neural network}} {{has been designed to}} obtain the neutron spectra from the Bonner spheres spectrometer's <b>count</b> <b>rates.</b> The neural network was trained using a large set of neutron spectra compiled by the International Atomic Energy Agency. These include spectra from isotopic neutron sources, reference and operational neutron spectra obtained from accelerators and nuclear reactors. The spectra were transformed from lethargy to energy distribution and were re-binned to 31 energy groups using the MCNP 4 C code. Re-binned spectra and UTA 4 matrix were used to calculate the expected <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> in Bonner spheres spectrometer. These <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> were used as input and correspondent spectrum was used as output during neural network training. The network has 7 input nodes, 56 neurons as hidden layer and 31 neurons in the output layer. After training the network was tested with the Bonner spheres <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> produced by twelve neutron spectra. The network allows unfolding the neutron spectrum from <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> measured with Bonner spheres. Good results are obtained when testing <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> belong to neutron spectra used during training, acceptable results are obtained for <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> obtained from actual neutron fields; however the network fails when <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> belong to monoenergetic neutron sources...|$|R
30|$|To {{perform the}} correction, {{the values of}} the <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> {{observed}} in the experiment (or patient scan) should be used, while {{the values of the}} true <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> can be calculated using Eq. 1 and the corresponding τ values. These τ values must be determined experimentally using phantoms.|$|R
25|$|EDX spectrometers are {{different}} from WDX spectrometers {{in that they are}} smaller, simpler in design and have fewer engineered parts, however they are not as accurate. WDX has greater resolution power than EDX. They can also use miniature X-ray tubes or gamma sources. This makes them cheaper and allows miniaturization and portability. This type of instrument is commonly used for portable quality control screening applications, such as testing toys for lead (Pb) content, sorting scrap metals, and measuring the lead content of residential paint. On the other hand, the low resolution and problems with low <b>count</b> <b>rate</b> and long dead-time makes them inferior for high-precision analysis. They are, however, very effective for high-speed, multi-elemental analysis. Field Portable XRF analysers currently on the market weigh less than 2kg, and have limits of detection on the order of 2 parts per million of lead (Pb) in pure sand.|$|E
500|$|Spectroscopy, as a measurement, is {{considerably}} {{more difficult than}} simple photometry, which measures the brightness of astronomical objects through certain filters. When photometric data {{is all that is}} available (for example, the Hubble Deep Field and the Hubble Ultra Deep Field), astronomers rely on a technique for measuring photometric redshifts. Due to the broad wavelength ranges in photometric filters and the necessary assumptions {{about the nature of the}} spectrum at the light-source, errors for these sorts of measurements can range up to , and are much less reliable than spectroscopic determinations. However, photometry does at least allow a qualitative characterization of a redshift. For example, if a Sun-like spectrum had a redshift of , it would be brightest in the infrared rather than at the yellow-green color associated with the peak of its blackbody spectrum, and the light intensity will be reduced in the filter by a factor of four, [...] Both the photon <b>count</b> <b>rate</b> and the photon energy are redshifted. (See K correction for more details on the photometric consequences of redshift.) ...|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two types}} of {{radiation}} readout: counts or radiation dose. The counts display is the simplest and is the number of ionizing events displayed either as a <b>count</b> <b>rate,</b> commonly [...] "counts per second", or as a total over a set time period (an integrated total). The counts readout is normally used when alpha or beta particles are being detected. More complex to achieve is a display of radiation dose rate, displayed in a unit such as the sievert which is normally used for measuring gamma or X-ray dose rates. A G-M tube can detect the presence of radiation, but not its energy which influences the radiation's ionising effect. Consequently, instruments measuring dose rate require the use of an energy compensated G-M tube, so that the dose displayed relates to the counts detected. The electronics will apply known factors to make this conversion, which is specific to each instrument and is determined by design and calibration.|$|E
30|$|A Siemens SymbiaT SPECT/CT {{camera with}} a medium energy {{collimator}} was used. A 295 -mL bottle was placed off-center inside a large cylinder filled with water, and 177 Lu activity was sequentially {{added up to}} a maximum of 9.12  GBq. The true <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> vs. observed <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> were plotted and fitted to the DT paralyzable model. This analysis was performed using counts recorded in the full spectrum and in other energy windows. The DT correction factors were calculated using the percentage difference between the true and the observed <b>count</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} acoustic emission behavior during fatigue crack growth test under constant and variable amplitude loading in 304 stainless steel. To describe the acoustic emission behavior, counts rate(d/dn) was related with {{stress intensity factor}} range (SIFR, K) in log-log plot. As a result of test, the relationship was represented a curve, which forms rise and fall behavior in <b>counts</b> <b>rate</b> as the SIFR increases. AE response to a single overload was sudden drop and slow recovery in <b>counts</b> <b>rate,</b> which was similar to crack growth retardation behavior. Under block loading, <b>counts</b> <b>rate</b> of each loading block was {{same as that of}} constant amplitude loading. Overall experimental results indicated that stress intensity factor controls the <b>counts</b> <b>rate</b> (d/dn) as well as crack growth rate (da/dn) regardless of load range or crack length...|$|R

2500|$|All {{elements}} absorb X-rays to some extent. Each element has {{a characteristic}} absorption spectrum {{which consists of}} a [...] "saw-tooth" [...] succession of fringes, each step-change of which has wavelength close to an emission line of the element. Absorption attenuates the secondary X-rays leaving the sample. For example, the mass absorption coefficient of silicon at the wavelength of the aluminium Kα line is 50 m²/kg, whereas that of iron is 377 m²/kg. This means that a given concentration of aluminium in a matrix of iron gives only one seventh of the <b>count</b> <b>rate</b> [...] {{compared with the same}} concentration of aluminium in a silicon matrix. Fortunately, mass absorption coefficients are well known and can be calculated. However, to calculate the absorption for a multi-element sample, the composition must be known. For analysis of an unknown sample, an iterative procedure is therefore used. It will be noted that, to derive the mass absorption accurately, data for the concentration of elements not measured by XRF may be needed, and various strategies are employed to estimate these. As an example, in cement analysis, the concentration of oxygen (which is not measured) is calculated by assuming that all other elements are present as standard oxides.|$|E
2500|$|Ulysses was {{launched}} October 6, 1990, and reached Jupiter for its [...] "gravitational slingshot" [...] in February 1992. It passed the south solar pole in June 1994 {{and crossed the}} ecliptic equator in February 1995. The solar X-ray and cosmic gamma-ray burst experiment (GRB) had 3 main objectives: study and monitor solar flares, detect and localize cosmic gamma-ray bursts, and in-situ detection of Jovian aurorae. Ulysses was the first satellite carrying a gamma burst detector which went outside the orbit of Mars. The hard X-ray detectors operated in the range 15–150 keV. The detectors consisted of 23-mm thick × 51-mm diameter CsI(Tl) crystals mounted via plastic light tubes to photomultipliers. The hard detector changed its operating mode depending on (1) measured <b>count</b> <b>rate,</b> (2) ground command, or (3) change in spacecraft telemetry mode. The trigger level was generally set for 8-sigma above background and the sensitivity is 10−6 erg/cm2 (1 nJ/m2). When a burst trigger is recorded, the instrument switches to record high resolution data, recording it to a 32-kbit memory for a slow telemetry read out. Burst data consist of either 16 s of 8-ms resolution count rates or 64 s of 32-ms count rates from {{the sum of the}} 2 detectors. There were also 16 channel energy spectra from the sum of the 2 detectors (taken either in 1, 2, 4, 16, or 32 second integrations). During 'wait' mode, the data were taken either in 0.25 or 0.5 s integrations and 4 energy channels (with shortest integration time being 8 s). Again, the outputs of the 2 detectors were summed.|$|E

30|$|These {{effects are}} clearly seen in Fig.  3. The {{intensity}} of the photopeaks relative to the background is {{the highest in the}} spectra corresponding to the lowest <b>count</b> <b>rates.</b> In the scatter windows, however, it is at the highest <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> that the relative intensity of counts is the highest. Due to their high intensity, photopeak windows lose relatively more counts than they gain. The effect is opposite in the other (background) regions, and this is why scatter windows show increased intensities at the high <b>count</b> <b>rates.</b> Detector 2 which was positioned closer to the source (with less attenuating material) experienced higher <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> shows much stronger pileup effect than detector 1. The pileup effects have also been observed in 131 I study by Guy et al. [13], similar to those that we are detecting in 177 Lu spectrum.|$|R
40|$|In this study, live {{plankton}} (50 mm in minimum dimension) in {{samples were}} counted by three analysts to determine <b>counting</b> <b>rates,</b> {{accuracy and precision}} of manual microscopy. <b>Counting</b> <b>rates</b> were compared with sample characteristics (e. g. concentration of dead organisms). In separate experiments, plankton proxies, spherical microbeads (49 and 150 mm in diameters), were added to samples {{with varying degrees of}} debris loading, including samples from full-scale, replica ballast tanks. These analyses were used to test the hypothesis that as debris loading increases, <b>counting</b> <b>rate</b> increases and accuracy decreases. Highly concentrated samples and samples with high concentrations of dead plankton resulted in signifi-cantly slower <b>counting</b> <b>rates.</b> The recovery of 50 -mm microbeads was lowest (75 %) in laboratory samples that contained the highest debris load. The recovery of 150 -mm microbeads was very high (. 98 %) in laboratory samples with and without debris. Field samples from the replica ballast tank were highly turbid, and microbead recoveries were low for both microbead sizes. Sample quality, therefore, will affect <b>counting</b> <b>rates</b> and accuracy and will limit the volume of the sample that can be analyzed within short-time windows available for counting live plank-ton samples...|$|R

50|$|The readout for alpha and beta {{radiation}} is normally in counts, whilst that for gamma and X-ray is normally in {{a reading of}} radiation dose. The SI unit for this latter is the sievert.

40|$|A high {{efficiency}} method for {{the generation of}} correlated photon pairs accompanied by a reliable means to characterize the efficiency of that process is needed {{in the study of}} correlated photon pairs and entangled states involving more than three photons, which have important potential applications in quantum information and quantum communication. In this study, we report the first characterization of the efficiency of generation of correlated photon pairs emitted from a CuCl single crystal using the biexciton-resonance hyper-parametric scattering (RHPS) method which is the highly efficient method of generation of correlated photon pairs. In order to characterize the generation efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio of correlated photon pairs using this method, we investigated the excitation density dependence on the photon <b>counting</b> <b>rate</b> and coincidence <b>counting</b> <b>rate</b> under resonant excitation. The excitation density dependence shows that the power characteristics of the photon <b>counting</b> <b>rates</b> changes from linear to quadratic dependence of the excitation density. This behavior represents a superposition of contributions from correlated photon pairs and non-correlated photons. Photon counting signals in this study were recorded as time-tag data, which provide the photon <b>counting</b> <b>rate</b> and coincidence <b>counting</b> <b>rate</b> simultaneously, and improve the coincidence <b>counting</b> <b>rate</b> by the factor of 200 compared to that obtained in previous work [K. Edamatsu et al. Nature 431, 167 - 170 (2004) ]. The analysis of the excitation density dependence shows that one photon-pair is produced by a pump pulse with 2 × 10 ^ 6 photons. Moreover, the generation efficiency of this method is improved by a factor of 10 ^ 7 compared to that of several methods based on the χ^(3) parametric process. Comment: 7 pages with 3 figure...|$|R

50|$|Even with {{chemical}} quenching, {{for a short}} time after a discharge pulse there is a period during which the tube is rendered insensitive and is thus temporarily unable to detect the arrival of any new ionizing particle (the so-called dead time; typically 50-100 microseconds). This causes a loss of counts at sufficiently high count rates and limits the G-M tube to an effective (accurate) <b>count</b> <b>rate</b> of approximately 103 counts per second even with external quenching. While a G-M tube is technically capable of reading higher count rates before it truly saturates, the level of uncertainty involved and the risk of saturation makes it extremely dangerous to rely upon higher <b>count</b> <b>rate</b> readings when attempting to calculate an equivalent radiation dose rate from the <b>count</b> <b>rate.</b> A consequence of this is that ion chamber instruments are usually preferred for higher count rates, however a modern external quenching technique can extend this upper limit considerably.|$|E
