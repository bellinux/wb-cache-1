Our peak-to-valley <b>current</b> <b>ratios</b> are 2. 9 {{at room temperature}} and 10 at liquid-nitrogen temperatures. Furthermore, we have observed peak current densities of 1. 7 × 10 ^ 5 A/cm^ 2. These figures of merit are substantially better than previously reported values. The improvements are obtained by adding spacer layers near the barriers, thinner well regions, and thinner barriers...|$|R

Thus, much research effort {{has focused on}} optimizing the performance of these devices. Herein, we experimentally validate a straightforward strategy for enhancing the high to low <b>current</b> <b>ratios</b> of protein-based protonic transistors. Upon reducing {{the thickness of the}} transistors’ active layers, we increase their high to low <b>current</b> <b>ratios</b> 2 -fold while leaving the other figures of merit unchanged. The measured ratio of 3. 3 is comparable to the best values found for analogous devices. These findings underscore the importance of the active layer geometry for optimum protonic transistor functionality...|$|R
40|$|I DDQ test {{loses its}} e#ectiveness for deep {{sub-micron}} chips since it cannot distinguish between faulty and fault-free currents. The concept of <b>current</b> <b>ratios,</b> {{in which the}} ratio of maximum to minimum I DDQ is used to screen faulty chips, has been previously proposed. However, it is incapable of screening some defects. The neighboring chips on a wafer have similar fault-free properties and are correlated. In this paper, the use of spatial correlation in combination with <b>current</b> <b>ratios</b> is investigated. By differentiating chips based on their non-conformance to local I DDQ variation, outliers are identified. The analysis of SEMATECH test data is presented...|$|R
25|$|Prior to the American Civil War, Pittsburgh was {{strongly}} abolitionist. It {{is considered the}} birthplace of the national Republican Party, as the party held its first convention here in February 1856. From the Civil War to the 1930s, Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold. The effects of the Great Depression, combined with entrenched local GOP scandals, resulted in a shift among voters to the Democratic Party. With the exceptions of the 1973 and 1977 elections (where lifelong Democrats ran off the party ticket), Democrats have been elected consecutively to the mayor's office since the 1933 election. The city's <b>current</b> <b>ratio</b> of party registration is 5 to 1 Democrat.|$|E

This compares to a <b>current</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1km of motorway to every 6,017.32 people in Belgium. Although welcomed by many people, {{the construction of new}} motorways in Ireland has not been without controversy or opposition. In particular, the construction of the M3 motorway through the archaeologically significant Tara-Skryne valley (or Gabhra) near Tara has led to protests and calls for protection of its landscape from many, including Pat Wallace, Director of the National Museum of Ireland, and other prominent figures in Ireland and other countries. The Smithsonian Institution in the US has placed the Hill of Tara archaeological complex on its list of endangered cultural treasures {{as a result of the}} M3's construction.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{enactment}} of the Reapportionment Act of 1929, a constant 435 House seats have been apportioned among the states according to each census, and determining {{the size of the}} House is not presently part of the apportionment process. With one exception, the apportionment of 1842, the House of Representatives had been enlarged by various degrees from sixty-five members in 1788 to 435 members by 1913. [...] The determination of size was made based on the aggregate national population, so long as the size of the House did not exceed 1 member for every 30,000 of the country's total population nor the size of any state's delegation exceed 1 for every 30,000 of that state's population.

5000|$|The <b>current</b> <b>ratio</b> is an {{indication}} of a firm's liquidity. Acceptable current ratios vary from industry to industry. [...] In many cases a creditor would consider a high <b>current</b> <b>ratio</b> to be better than a low <b>current</b> <b>ratio,</b> because a high <b>current</b> <b>ratio</b> indicates that the company is more likely to pay the creditor back. Large current ratios are not always a good sign for investors.

A <b>current</b> <b>ratio</b> of less than 1 indicates that the company may have problems meeting its short-term obligations. Some types of businesses can operate with a <b>current</b> <b>ratio</b> of less than one however. If inventory turns into cash much more rapidly than the accounts payable become due, then the firm's <b>current</b> <b>ratio</b> can comfortably remain less than one. Inventory is valued {{at the cost of}} acquiring it and the firm intends to sell the inventory for more than this cost. The sale will therefore generate substantially more cash than the value of inventory on the balance sheet.

3000|$|... 1 -D {{semiconductor}} nanomaterials such as nanowires, nanotubes, and nanorods {{have attracted}} much attention due to their unique properties and the quantum confinement effect [1 – 14]. In particular, indium arsenide (InAs) nanowires (NWs), due to their confinement effects and high carrier mobility, {{have been used to}} extend unique magnetic and electric properties. This makes them a potential candidate for a wide range (880 ~ 3500  nm) of optoelectronic device applications and field-effect transistors (FETs) [15 – 20]. In specific, single InAs NW FETs with an outstanding electron mobility in the range of 3000 ~ 10000  cm 2 /Vs have been extensively investigated [15, 18]. However, these devices, based on pristine InAs NWs, always suffer from a large leakage current and small on/off <b>current</b> <b>ratios</b> originating mainly from their small electronic band gap (0.34  eV). Large leakage current and small on/off <b>current</b> <b>ratios</b> affect the switching properties of devices and are of great significance in the practical applications of NW FETs.|$|R
