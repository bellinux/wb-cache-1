50|$|Size-exclusion {{chromatography}} (SEC), {{also known}} as molecular sieve chromatography, is a chromatographic method in which molecules in solution are separated by their size, {{and in some cases}} molecular weight. It is usually applied to large molecules or macromolecular complexes such as proteins and industrial polymers. Typically, when an aqueous solution is used to transport the sample through the column, the technique is known as gel-filtration chromatography, versus the name gel permeation chromatography, which is used when an organic solvent is used as a mobile phase. SEC is a widely used polymer <b>characterization</b> <b>method</b> because of its ability to provide good molar mass distribution (Mw) results for polymers.|$|E
50|$|Dispersed Particle Resistance (DPR) is a {{measured}} parameter to characterize battery active materials. It {{is seen as}} an indicator of lithium-ion battery active material rate capability. It is the slope of voltage-current linear fit for active material samples in suspensions. It can be obtained by applying different voltages on a suspension and measure the currents, after which the data points are plotted. The slope of the plot is referred to as Dispersed Particle Resistance. It can also be done in the opposite way where different currents are applied and voltages are measured. The key advantage of this Dispersed Particle Resistance technique is fast and accurate comparing with the conventional <b>characterization</b> <b>method</b> for which batteries need to be fabricated and tested for a long time.|$|E

It is expected that in the future, phenomena will be understood on the atomic scale and applied to large-scale arrays for a complete understanding of the various affects that determine the real cell efficiency. There is a need for a fundamental understanding from atomic and nanoscale characterizations of impurities, native defects, extended defects and interfaces to provide the necessary understanding of these types of PV cells. This information from fundamental probes should be used for input to the performance characterization of the developing technologies, which include high-flux operation, multijunction and lower band-gap systems. These methods will allow new materials to come to realization at a much faster rate than was possible in previous years...|$|R

40|$|Ultra-precision {{freeform}} {{surfaces are}} complex surfaces that possess non-rotational symmetry and {{are widely used}} in advanced optics applications. However, {{there is a lack}} of a surface <b>characterization</b> <b>method</b> that measures the form accuracy of the ultra-precision freeform surfaces with micrometre to sub-micrometre form accuracy. Due to the high precision requirement of the ultra-precision freeform surfaces, this inevitably involves the outliers in the measured data that would significantly affect the accuracy and the performance of the form <b>characterization</b> <b>method.</b> Although some research work has been found in the development of the form <b>characterization</b> <b>method,</b> most workers have not considered the influence of outliers. It is vital to incorporate robust estimation in the surface <b>characterization</b> <b>method</b> for catering for the influence of outliers. In this paper, a robust form <b>characterization</b> <b>method</b> (RFCM) is presented to characterize the form accuracy of the ultra-precision freeform surfaces. A series of computer simulation and experimental analyses were undertaken to verify the RFCM. The theoretical results agree well with the simulation and experimental results.

40|$|International audiencePower {{consumption}} {{is one of}} the major issues in System-on-Chip (SoC) design with advanced semiconductor technologies for low power applications such as mobile phones. Recently, banking several 1 -bit flip-flops has been proposed as a solution to reduce the power consumption in clock networks. For this purpose, to build an accurate power model for multi-bit flip-flop banks is required. However, it is an excessively timeconsuming and sophisticated work due to a high number of pins. Therefore, we first propose a simplified power <b>characterization</b> <b>method</b> to reduce characterization time. Then an efficient power modeling is introduced to create an accurate state-dependent power model for multi-bit flip-flop banks. Experimental results show that the proposed <b>characterization</b> <b>method</b> allows to linearly increase CPU time with 1. 3 X per bit comparing with exponentially increasing CPU time by the traditional <b>characterization</b> <b>method.</b> In addition, the proposed power modeling provides an average error of 6 % compared to SPICE simulation results...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 In {{this thesis}} {{steady-state}} (i. e. steady-state {{with respect to}} the applied voltage waveform) transient current-transient voltage [i(t) -v(t) ], transient brightness-transient current [b(t) -i(t) ], transient brightness-transient voltage [b(t) -v(t) ], transient current [i(t) ], transient brightness [b(t) ], and detrapped charge analysis are introduced as novel organic light emitting device (OLED) <b>characterization</b> <b>methods.</b> These analysis methods involve measurement of the instantaneous voltage [v(t) ] across, the instantaneous current [i(t) ] through, and the instantaneous brightness [b(t) ] from an OLED when it is subjected to a bipolar, piecewise-linear applied voltage waveform. The utility of these <b>characterization</b> <b>methods</b> is demonstrated via comparison of different types of OLEDs and polymer light emitting devices (PLEDs) and from a preliminary study of OLED aging. Some of the device parameters obtained from these <b>characterization</b> <b>methods</b> include: OLED capacitance, accumulated charge, electron transport layer (ETL) thickness, hole transport layer (HTL) thickness, OLED thickness, parallel resistance, and series resistance. A current bump observed in i(t) -v(t) curves is attributed to the removal of accumulated hole charge from the ETL/HTL interface and is only observed in heterojunctions (i. e. OLEDs), not in single-layer devices (i. e. PLEDs). Using the <b>characterization</b> <b>methods</b> developed in this thesis, two important OLED device physics conclusions are obtained: (1) Hole accumulation at the ETL/HTL interface {{plays an important role in}} establishing balanced charge injection of electrons and holes into the OLED. (2) The ETL behaves as a leaky insulator while the HTL more efficiently conducts charge and acts as a voltage-dependent resistor. A preliminary investigation of the aging properties of OLEDs is presented as further evidence of the utility of the novel <b>characterization</b> <b>methods</b> developed in this thesis. In general, aging is characterized by a softer turn on of the forward bias portions of i(t) -v(t) and b(t) -v(t) curves. Also, some aging recovery is possible if the OLEDs are subjected to a zero or reverse bias...|$|R

For sampled-time systems, this allows knowing the state of the net charge at each sampling time without distorting the measurement.

The goodness of the proposed approach is obtained by matching the experimentally obtained closed loop response with the one predicted using the proposed <b>characterization</b> <b>method.</b> The <b>characterization</b> <b>method</b> also provides a criterion to avoid nonlinear effects, such as fractal-like behaviour, in charge control.
