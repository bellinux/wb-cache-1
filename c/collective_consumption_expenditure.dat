30|$|Our aim in {{this paper}} is to utilize the {{algorithmic}} feedback control framework for the design of short-term fiscal policy interventions. That is, we want to design linear feedback policy rules for the fiscal policy instruments available so that predetermined (fixed) desired sequences for the policy targets (GDP and public debt levels) are simultaneously tracked. In particular, we assume that the policymaker has at his disposal two instruments: expenditures related to compensation of public sector employees, social benefits, etc. (i.e., expenditures that cover individual and <b>collective</b> <b>consumption)</b> and <b>expenditures</b> related to investment projects (e.g., infrastructure) that will be funded by the government (either via its own budget or by using external funding such as EU structural funds or the funds available from the so-called Juncker Investment Plan). These investment expenditures are subject to several time lags (including, among others, legislative, design and implementation lags), and as a result, they will affect the economy with a possibly substantial delay; however, the feedback mechanism used allows us to explicitly incorporate these lags into the design of the fiscal policy rules. These rules will provide the exact sequence of the policy instruments necessary to ensure that the target levels of GDP and public debt will be simultaneously met, without any deviation (thus, the tracking error will be equal to zero).|$|R
3000|$|The {{behavior}} {{described here}} has an apparently ambiguous {{relationship with the}} gift-related expenditures of Chinese rural-to-urban migrant workers described above. The Chinese expenditure is directed to <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> whereas the <b>expenditure</b> and related <b>consumption</b> described in the preceding two paragraphs operates at the individual level. Also, the Chinese case is self-consciously directed to maintaining or enhancing face, whereas purchase of cosmetics and other appearance-enhancing goods and services is directed to achieving an identity of a particular type that enhances the person’s competitive appeal to others. Competitive appeal is mentioned here because, as Simmel (1978, pp. 290 – 91) notes, one objective of competition is {{to attract the attention}} of others. The idea of “competitive appeal” is important in this context because even if the evolutionary psychology explanation of spending on beauty products, as a tactic for outcompeting intra-sexual rivals in attracting mates who possess increased resources, is not accepted then a broader notion, encapsulated in Simmel’s idea of a need satisfied by fashion for individual differentiation, can be considered. All of this reinforces the idea that beauty expenditure is for the sake of achieving a particular identity. What, if any, is the relationship between identity and face? [...]...|$|R
40|$|We {{apply the}} <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> model of Browning et al. (2010) to analyse {{economic}} well-being and poverty among the elderly. The model focuses on individual preferences, a consumption technology that captures {{the economies of}} scale {{of living in a}} couple, and a sharing rule that governs the intra-household allocation of resources. The model is applied to a time series of Dutch <b>consumption</b> <b>expenditure</b> surveys. Our empirical results indicate substantial economies of scale and a wife's share that is increasing in total expenditures. We further calculated two sets of poverty rates: one based on the <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> model and one based on the traditional approach with a standard equivalence scale. Poverty among widowers is underestimated by the traditional approach. The same is true for women (men) in elderly couples for the first (later) time periods in our analysis. Finally, we analysed the impact of becoming a widow(er). Based on cross-sectional evidence, we find that the drop in material well-being following the husband's death is rather substantial for women. For men, the picture is reversed. © 2012 Elsevier B. V [...] SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

It is concluded that <b>consumption</b> <b>expenditure</b> of rural residents has increased year by year in Hebei Province with the enhancement of consumption level and the slight reduction of survivable consumption which is mainly caused by the decline of food consumption. Meanwhile, there is a slow growth of enjoyable consumption, mainly reflected in the transportation and communication expenditure and other goods and services expenditure. According to the investigation data of rural residents in Hebei Province from the year 2003 to 2007, qualitative analysis on the eight indices of <b>consumption</b> <b>expenditure</b> is conducted.
