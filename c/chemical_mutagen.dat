Later, a nucleotidyl tranferase is used to fill in the gap with the correct base, using the template strand as the reference.|$|E

50|$|The method {{combines}} a standard and efficient technique of mutagenesis using a <b>chemical</b> <b>mutagen</b> such as ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) with a sensitive DNA screening-technique that identifies single base mutations (also called point mutations) in a target gene. The TILLING method {{relies on the}} formation of DNA heteroduplexes that are formed when multiple alleles are amplified by PCR and are then heated and slowly cooled. A “bubble” forms at the mismatch of the two DNA strands, which is then cleaved by a single stranded nucleases. The products are then separated by size on several different platforms (see below).|$|E
50|$|High {{rates of}} {{chromosome}} aberrations resulting from ionizing radiation and the accompanied detrimental effects made researchers look for alternate sources for inducing mutations. As a result, {{an array of}} <b>chemical</b> <b>mutagens</b> has been discovered. The most widely used <b>chemical</b> <b>mutagens</b> are alkylating agents. Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) {{is the most popular}} because of its effectiveness and ease of handling, especially its detoxiﬁcation through hydrolysis for disposal. Nitroso compounds are the other alkylating agents widely used, but they are light-sensitive and more precautions need to be taken because of their higher volatility. EMS has become a commonly used mutagen for developing large numbers of mutants for screening such as in developing TILLING populations. Although many <b>chemicals</b> are <b>mutagens,</b> only few have been used in practical breeding as the doses need to optimised and also because the effectiveness is not high in plants for many.|$|R

50|$|Jain's early {{researches}} on Lilium, a genus of herbaceous plants, and its meiotic {{cell division}} revealed {{the correlation between}} the chromosome condensation and nucleolar synthesis. After joining IARI, he and his colleagues worked on the cytological mechanisms of genetic recombination, on Delphinium, a perennial flowering plant genus. His work contributed {{to the development of a}} protocol for controlling the interchromosome level, which was experimentally evidenced by subsequent researches by others. Later, he worked on tomatao and Drosophila (popularly known as fruit flies) and his studies assisted in the discovery of <b>chemical</b> <b>mutagen</b> specificity. He headed the wheat development programs of IARI and initiated three such programs to develop high-yielding varieties of wheat. Ribosomal synthesis in plant celles was another area of his researches. He is credited with developing the concept of national multilineal complex of varieties and the proposal of the multiple and inter-cropping patterns, later popularized by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute. He authored five books which included Plant Breeding: Mendelian to Molecular Approaches Genetics: Principles, Concepts and Implications, and Green Revolution: History, Impact and Future and several articles which document the body of his work.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to studying {{the effect of}} radiation for SLT, Russell et al. were also interested in studying the effect of chemical mutagens such as procarbazine and ethylnitrosourea for SLT. At that time, procarbazine was the most potent <b>chemical</b> <b>mutagen</b> known to cause a significant spermatogonial mutagenesis in an SLT, although at a rate one-third of that of X-rays. Russell's earlier mutagenesis work on Drosophila using diethylnitrosoamine (DEN) triggered them to use DEN for the SLT. However, DEN needs to be enzymatically converted into an alkylating agent {{in order to be}} mutagenic and probably this enzymatic activation was not sufficient in mammals. This could be illustrated by the extremely low mutation rate in mice given by DEN (3 in 60,179 offsprings). To overcome this problem, a new mutagen, N-ethyl N-nitrosourea (ENU), an alkylating agent, which {{does not need to be}} metabolised, was suggested to be used by Ekkehart Vegel to Russell et al. The ENU (250 mg/kg) induced mice underwent a period of sterility for 10 weeks. After recovery, 90 males were crossed to the T-stock females and 7584 pups were obtained. Their results showed that a dose of 250 mg/kg of ENU was capable of producing a mutation rate 5 times higher than that obtained with 600R (1R = 2.6 x10^-4 coulombs/kg) of acute X-irradiation. This rate was also 15 times higher to that obtained with procarbazine (600 mg/kg).|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{mutation}} induction {{through the use}} of a <b>chemical</b> <b>mutagen</b> as a method of improving some quality traits in jute (Corchorus olitorious L.) were investigated. Jute seeds were treated with colchicine at five different concentrations (0. 1 mM, 0. 5 mM, 1. 0 mM, 2. 0 mM and control) for two mutant generations (M 1 and M 2) with the aim of improving the growth and yield parameters of the plant. The results obtained revealed highly significant increase (P≤ 0. 01) in the plant heights, number of leaves, leaf area, internodes length, number of pods/plant, length of pods and number of seeds/pod with decrease in the concentration of the mutagen. However, the anthesis period was found to be reduced with decreased in colchicine concentrations. The <b>chemical</b> <b>mutagen</b> was therefore found to improve the qualitative traits associated with growth and yield of jute. The effect of the mutagen was concentration dependants; decrease with increase in the concentration with 0. 1 mM concentration having the highest effects...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>mutagens</b> {{were not}} {{demonstrated}} to cause mutation until the 1940s, when Charlotte Auerbach and J. M. Robson found that mustard gas can cause mutations in fruit flies. A {{large number of}} <b>chemical</b> <b>mutagens</b> have since been identified, especially after {{the development of the}} Ames test in the 1970s by Bruce Ames that screens for mutagens and allows for preliminary identification of carcinogens. [...] Early studies by Ames showed around 90% of known carcinogens can be identified in Ames test as mutagenic (later studies however gave lower figures), and ~80% of the mutagens identified through Ames test may also be carcinogens. [...] Mutagens are not necessarily carcinogens, and vice versa. Sodium azide for example may be mutagenic (and highly toxic), but it has not been shown to be carcinogenic.|$|R
