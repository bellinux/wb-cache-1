For example, if one piece of information, taken from a secret document, is put into a document along with 100 pages of unclassified information, the document, as a whole, will be secret. Proper rules stipulate that every paragraph will bear a classification marking of (U) for Unclassified, (<b>C)</b> for <b>Confidential,</b> (S) for Secret, and (TS) for Top Secret. Therefore, in this example, only one paragraph will have the (S) marking. If the page containing that paragraph is double-sided, the page should be marked SECRET on {{top and bottom of}} both sides.|$|R
50|$|Several {{of these}} horror films also {{incorporate}} the sub-theme of voyeurism, whereby the motel owner spies on (or even films) the sexual exploits of the guests. This {{plays on the}} long-established connotations of motels and illicit sexual activity, which has itself {{formed the basis for}} numerous other films, variously representing the thriller, comedy, teen film, and sexploitation genres. Stephen <b>C.</b> Apostolof's Motel <b>Confidential</b> (1967) and the porn film Motel for Lovers (1970) were two notable early examples. More recent manifestations include Paradise Motel (1985), Talking Walls (1987), Desire and Hell at Sunset Motel (1991), and the Korean films Motel Cactus (1997) and The Motel (2005).|$|R
