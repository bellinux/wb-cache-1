During these campaigns, he proved equally adept at leading heavy or light cavalry, although some military analysts consider he was a better heavy cavalry leader. In 1793, he was promoted to general of brigade.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{deadline}} of June 5, the final number of signatures was never determined because the petitions were sent {{out of state}} to avoid a subpoena from the Sauk County district attorney, an ardent McCarthy supporter who was investigating {{the leaders of the}} recall <b>campaign</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grounds that they had violated Wisconsin's Corrupt Practices Act. Chicago newspapermen later tallied 335,000 names while another 50,000 were said to be hidden in Minneapolis, with other lists buried on Sauk County farms.|$|E

5|$|After Justinian died in 565, his successor, Justin II {{refused to}} pay the large tribute to the Persians. Meanwhile, the Germanic Lombards invaded Italy; {{by the end of}} the century only a third of Italy was in Byzantine hands. Justin's successor, Tiberius II, {{choosing}} between his enemies, awarded subsidies to the Avars while taking military action against the Persians. Though Tiberius' general, Maurice, led an effective <b>campaign</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eastern frontier, subsidies failed to restrain the Avars. They captured the Balkan fortress of Sirmium in 582, while the Slavs began to make inroads across the Danube.|$|E
5|$|By April 1975, morale in the Republic of Vietnam Air Force {{had sunk}} {{so low that}} some of their {{personnel}} simply defected to the Communist side. In a well-known incident, South Vietnamese pilot Nguyen Thanh Trung used his F-5E fighter-bomber to attack the Presidential Palace in Saigon instead of North Vietnamese troops. Shortly afterwards, Trung joined the Communist forces and he was ordered to train a group of North Vietnamese pilots to operate the U.S.-made A-37 Dragonfly fighter-bomber, in order to support the Ho Chi Minh <b>Campaign.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> afternoon of April 28, 1975, Trung led a flight of five A-37 fighter-bombers against Tan Son Nhut Air Base, which temporarily stopped U.S. and South Vietnamese evacuation efforts.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Capper was {{attached}} to the force dispatched to the Tirah <b>Campaign</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> North-West Frontier of British India. One of his tasks there was to supervise the construction of the first road for wheeled vehicles across the Khyber pass. At the campaign's successful conclusion, he was promoted to major and transferred to South Africa while his wife Edith Mary (neé Beausire) and their son John Beausire Copeland Capper returned to England. Arriving in South Africa at the outbreak of the Second Boer War, Capper became deputy assistant director of railways, a vital job given the lengthy and dangerous supply routes along which the war was fought. In 1900, he received the brevet rank of lieutenant colonel and commanded several locally raised units, eventually becoming the commandant at Johannesburg. He returned to England in June 1902, following the end of hostilities the previous month, and on 31 October 1902 was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB).|$|E

5|$|In September the {{regiment}} {{was sent to}} Italy {{with the rest of}} the division and fought in the Moro River <b>Campaign</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Adriatic coast in December. The division fought in the Battle of Monte Cassino, for which Div Cav provided support. The regiment then participated in the drive on the Gothic Line, where elements entered Florence in August. In October it was reorganised as the Divisional Cavalry Battalion, an infantry unit, because its armoured cars were unsuitable for Italian terrain. The battalion fought in the final Allied offensive in Italy, Operation Grapeshot, during early 1945. It reached Trieste in the first week of May and was stationed there until February 1946. That month the Divisional Cavalry deployed to Japan, once again as a regiment. Stationed in southern Kyushu, it was disbanded on 1 September 1947.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} month of the 2011–12 season, Hansen was hit from behind by defenceman Shea Weber in a game against the Nashville Predators on 20 October 2011. While he was uninjured on the play, Weber was fined $2,500 — the maximum {{allowable}} financial penalty — by the League the following day. The following month, Hansen earned a brief stint playing on the Canucks' first line with Daniel and Henrik Sedin, replacing Alexandre Burrows. Enjoying a career season, he surpassed his previous personal best of nine goals in the NHL by December 2011. He continued to play the majority of the <b>campaign</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Canucks' checking line and finished with 16 goals and 39 points over 82 games. Although Vancouver won their second consecutive Presidents' Trophy in 2011–12, they lost {{in the first round of}} the playoffs to the Los Angeles Kings. Hansen had one goal in the five-game series.|$|E
5|$|Jolie has fronted a {{campaign}} against sexual violence in military conflict zones by the UK government, which made the issue a priority of its 2013 G8 presidency. In May 2012, she launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) with Foreign Secretary William Hague, who was inspired to <b>campaign</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue by her Bosnian war drama In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011). PSVI was established to complement wider UK government work by raising awareness and promoting international co-operation. Jolie spoke on the subject at the G8 foreign ministers meeting, where the attending nations adopted a historic declaration, and before the UN security council, which responded by adopting its broadest resolution on the issue to date. In June 2014, she co-chaired the four-day Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, the largest-ever meeting on the subject, {{which resulted in a}} protocol endorsed by 151 nations.|$|E

5|$|On Providencia Island, {{two teams}} of aid personnel, {{consisting}} {{of a total of}} 800 people, from National Intervention Teams were mobilized in response to Beta.
