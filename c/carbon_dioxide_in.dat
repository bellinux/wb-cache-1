5|$|The partial {{pressures}} of oxygen and <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> the arterial blood are {{measured by the}} peripheral chemoreceptors – the aortic and carotid bodies, and the central chemoreceptors of the medulla oblongata of the brainstem. The peripheral chemoreceptors are {{more sensitive to the}} arterial partial pressure of oxygen than they are to the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. The central chemoreceptor is particularly sensitive to the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid, which is directly influenced by the partial pressure of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> the arterial blood.|$|E
5|$|Their {{effects are}} far-reaching; by {{increasing}} the amount of respiration in the oceans, viruses are indirectly responsible for reducing the amount of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> the atmosphere by approximately 3 gigatonnes of carbon per year.|$|E

50|$|Although {{almost all}} heterotrophs cannot {{synthesize}} complete organic molecules from <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide,</b> some <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> is incorporated <b>in</b> their metabolism. Notably pyruvate carboxylase consumes <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> (as bicarbonate ions) {{as part of}} gluconeogenesis, and <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> is consumed <b>in</b> various anaplerotic reactions.|$|R
5|$|Solar energy {{may be used}} in a water {{stabilization}} pond to treat waste water without chemicals or electricity. A further environmental advantage is that algae grow in such ponds and consume <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> photosynthesis, although algae may produce toxic chemicals that make the water unusable.|$|E
5|$|A {{quarter of}} all people with Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} develop weakness of the breathing muscles leading to respiratory failure, the inability to breathe adequately to maintain healthy levels of oxygen and/or <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> the blood. This life-threatening scenario is complicated by other medical problems such as pneumonia, severe infections, blood clots in the lungs and bleeding in the digestive tract in 60% of those who require artificial ventilation.|$|E
5|$|Biogas, or {{landfill}} gas, is a biofuel produced {{through the}} intermediary stage of anaerobic digestion consisting mainly of 45–90% biologically produced methane and <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide.</b> <b>In</b> early 2007 a thermophilic anaerobic digestion facility was commissioned in Stornoway in the Western Isles. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and the Renewable Energy Association are also {{leading the way}} towards {{the establishment of a}} digestate standard to facilitate the use of solid outputs from digesters on land. Anaerobic digestion and mechanical biological treatment facilities have been planned at a number of other locations in Scotland, such as Westray.|$|E

5|$|If OHS is suspected, various {{tests are}} {{required}} for its confirmation. The most important initial test is the demonstration of elevated <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> the blood. This requires an arterial blood gas determination, which involves taking a blood sample from an artery, usually the radial artery. Given {{that it would be}} complicated to perform this test on every patient with sleep-related breathing problems, some suggest that measuring bicarbonate levels in normal (venous) blood would be a reasonable screening test. If this is elevated (27mmol/l or higher), blood gasses should be measured.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decade}} {{following}} World War II, Lambertsen et al. made further discoveries {{on the effects}} of breathing oxygen under pressure and methods of prevention. Their work on intermittent exposures for extension of oxygen tolerance and on a model for prediction of pulmonary oxygen toxicity based on pulmonary function are key documents in the development of standard operating procedures when breathing increased pressures of oxygen. Lambertsen's work showing the effect of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> decreasing time to onset of central nervous system symptoms has influenced work from current exposure guidelines to future breathing apparatus design.|$|E
5|$|Information {{from the}} {{peripheral}} chemoreceptors is relayed {{to a series}} of interconnected nuclei which comprise the respiratory centres in the medulla oblongata and the pons of the brainstem. This information determines the average rate of ventilation of the alveoli of the lungs, to keep the partial pressures of oxygen and <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> the arterial blood constant. The respiratory centre does so via motor neurons which activate the muscles of respiration (in particular the diaphragm).|$|E

5|$|Lithium, sodium, and {{potassium}} have many applications, while rubidium and caesium are very useful in academic contexts {{but do not}} have many applications yet. Lithium is often used in batteries, and lithium oxide can help process silica. Lithium stearate is a thickener {{and can be used}} to make lubricating greases; it is produced from lithium hydroxide, which is also used to absorb <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> space capsules and submarines. Lithium chloride is used as a brazing alloy for aluminium parts. Metallic lithium is used in alloys with magnesium and aluminium to give very tough and light alloys.|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} partial {{pressures of}} oxygen and <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> the arterial blood are homeostatically controlled. A {{rise in the}} arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and, to a lesser extent, a fall in the arterial partial pressure of oxygen, will reflexly cause deeper and faster breathing till the blood gas tensions return to normal. The converse happens when the carbon dioxide tension falls, or, again to a lesser extent, the oxygen tension rises: the rate and depth of breathing are reduced till blood gas normality is restored.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} set of catabolic {{reactions}} in animals can be separated into three main stages. In the first stage, large organic molecules, such as proteins, polysaccharides or lipids, are digested into their smaller components outside cells. Next, these smaller molecules are taken up by cells and converted to smaller molecules, usually acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which releases some energy. Finally, the acetyl group on the CoA is oxidised to water and <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain, releasing the energy that is stored by reducing the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) into NADH.|$|E

5|$|Secondary {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces (SSPs), by definition, {{occur in}} individuals with significant underlying lung disease. Symptoms in SSPs {{tend to be}} more severe than in PSPs, as the unaffected lungs are generally unable to replace the loss of function in the affected lungs. Hypoxemia (decreased blood-oxygen levels) is usually present and may be observed as cyanosis (blue discoloration of the lips and skin). Hypercapnia (accumulation of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> the blood) is sometimes encountered; this may cause confusion and – if very severe – may result in comas. The sudden onset of breathlessness in someone with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, or other serious lung diseases should therefore prompt investigations to identify the possibility of a pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{lead for}} water pipes is {{problematic}} {{in areas with}} soft or acidic water. Hard water forms insoluble layers in the pipes whereas soft and acidic water dissolves the lead pipes. Dissolved <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> the carried water may result {{in the formation of}} soluble lead bicarbonate; oxygenated water may similarly dissolve lead as lead(II) hydroxide. Drinking such water, over time, can cause health problems due to the toxicity of the dissolved lead. The harder the water the more calcium bicarbonate and sulfate it will contain, and the more the inside of the pipes will be coated with a protective layer of lead carbonate or lead sulfate.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} period, the {{concentration}} of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> the waters of Harveys Creek at West Nanticoke ranged from 0.3 to 8.7 milligrams per liter.
