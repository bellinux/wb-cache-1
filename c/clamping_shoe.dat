40|$|A linear {{electrostatic}} {{stepper motor}} {{has been designed}} and fabricated in a single mask surface micromachining process. It consists of two drive units that alternately generate a step to move the shuttle. The friction and adhesion in the clamps has been measured. A friction coefficient of 0. 8 ± 0. 3 has been found. The adhesion in the clamp is just low enough to release the <b>clamping</b> <b>shoe.</b> Stepping cycles have been performed successfully to obtain a deflection of 15 ¿m, with steps {{in the order of}} 2 ¿m. The deflection is limited by the suspension. The generated force equals 3 ¿N at 40 V driving voltag...|$|E
5000|$|Hand brake: {{manually}} {{activated by}} two wheels in each cab, {{one for each}} bogie, which make the brake <b>shoes</b> <b>clamp</b> against the wheel; {{a total of four}} out of six axles are braked this way.|$|R

Caption: "A PENNY stuck {{underneath}} the <b>shoe</b> <b>clamps</b> of ice skates and an ice arena as a substitute for ballet bars were the beginnings of ice skating career for Miss Helga Neff in the Ice Capades show which is being presented through Saturday at the Municipal Auditorium. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{trick is}} {{performed}} {{by removing the}} shoe furthest from the audience, and turning that foot 90 degrees away from the audience, with the empty <b>shoe</b> <b>clamped</b> between both feet. When the performer stands {{on the tip of}} the hidden foot, the two shoes are raised together, and the audience assumes that these are both of the performer's feet.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{content was}} focused on {{identifying}} emerging trends and forecasting potential new ones, from accessorizing with nipple <b>clamps</b> through Z-CoiL <b>shoes</b> and Under Armour sports clothing. Explaining their original interest in fashion they have said ‘If there is a temporality that DIS explores, it is mostly imagined. What is more pertinent to this project {{is the fact that}} our generation has a blurred point of view on values and on temporality itself. The past, present, and future—or at least a visually skewed representation of them—are immediately accessible by typing a few keywords into an engine. In this way, reality is multivalent, personal, and constantly in flux. The fashion in DIS is not [...] "high" [...] nor [...] "low." [...] It is simply Medium.’ ...|$|R
