40|$|Most neuroendocrine <b>tumors</b> <b>of</b> the {{gastrointestinal}} tract are traditionally termed "carcinoid tumors. " More than 90 % of all gastrointestinal carcinoids {{are located in}} the appendix, small intestine, rectum, and mesenteric carcinoids are rare. Even when invasive, most carcinoids are relatively indolent and display minimal histological pleomorphism. A minority <b>of</b> these <b>tumors</b> is clinically more aggressive and has a less differentiated histological pattern. <b>Carcinoid</b> <b>tumors</b> <b>of</b> the <b>intestine</b> frequently invade the mesentery, but a primary carcinoid of the mesentery is extremely rare. Mesenteric <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors</b> can go unrecognized due to nonspecific symptoms. We report an unusual case of two large primary mesenteric <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors</b> in a 38 -year-old male who had excellent recovery following surgery.

40|$|Abstract Background Metastatic breast carcinoids {{are rare}} neoplasms. They can {{be mistaken for}} primary breast {{carcinoma}} both clinically and radiologically, even with known history <b>of</b> <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumor</b> elsewhere in the body. Case presentation We report a case of unilateral breast metastasis from <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>of</b> the small <b>intestine</b> in a 52 -year-old woman who was successfully treated by lumpectomy and radiation therapy. An extensive {{review of the literature}} reveals only a few cases of metastatic carcinoid to the breast from small intestinal primaries. Conclusion Clinical suspicion for metastasis should be high in a patient with breast mass and history of known carcinoid elsewhere in the body. Lumpectomy alone may be effective in these patients. Mastectomy and especially axillary dissection could be avoided. Their histological appearance may mimic ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast. However, the distinction is important due to differences in management and prognosis. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{etiology}} of small intestinal cancer (SIC) is largely unknown, {{and there are}} very few epidemiological studies published to date. No studies have investigated abdominal adiposity in relation to SIC. METHODS: We investigated overall obesity and abdominal adiposity in relation to SIC in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), a large prospective cohort of approximately half a million men and women from ten European countries. Overall obesity and abdominal obesity were assessed by body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95  % confidence intervals (CIs). Stratified analyses were conducted by sex, BMI, and smoking status. RESULTS: During an average of 13. 9  years of follow-up, 131 incident cases of SIC (including 41 adenocarcinomas, 44 malignant <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors,</b> 15 sarcomas and 10 lymphomas, and 21 unknown histology) were identified. WC was positively associated with SIC in a crude model that also included BMI (HR per 5 -cm increase =  1. 20, 95  % CI 1. 04, 1. 39), but this association attenuated in the multivariable model (HR 1. 18, 95  % CI 0. 98, 1. 42).

Methods: We have retrospectively reviewed the hospital records of 11 consecutive patients undergoing surgical treatment for <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors</b> <b>of</b> the lung between 1992 and 2007. Results: Patients with <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors</b> accounted for 0. 8 % (11 of 1319) of the patients undergoing surgical treatment for nonsmall cell lung cancer. The group comprised six males and five females {{with a mean age}} at presentation of 58. 6 years (range 27 – 78 years). All of the operations were lobectomies, including two sleeve lobectomies.

The imageology findings {{are similar to}} those in other gallbladder cancers. Case presentation A 46 -year-old woman was hospitalized with a preoperative diagnosis of gallbladder carcinoma, The patient was referred for surgical opinion and laparotomy was subsequently performed. A 4 × 5 cm mass was found within the gallbladder, located on the free surface of the body and fundus of the gallbladder. Neither metastases nor direct invasion to the liver was found. The entire mass and gallbladder were excised and intact. Histologically, the <b>tumor</b> consisted <b>of</b> small oval cells with round-to-oval neclei and tumor cells formed small nodular, trabeculare and acinar structures. The tumor showed moderate pleomorphism with scattered mitotic figures, but no definite evidence of vascular permeation, perineural invasion or lymphatic permeation was seen. The tumor cells invaded the mucosa extensively, and some penetrated the muscular layer but not through the serosa of the gallbladder into the liver. Immunohistochemical studies revealed strong positive reaction for chromogranin A and NSE. This lesion was proved to be a primary <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>of</b> the gallbladder.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Neuroendocrine {{tumors are}} {{the second most}} common {{neoplasms}} of the larynx. Histopathologically, neuroendocrine tumors can be classified into four types: typical <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors,</b> atypical <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors,</b> small cell neuroendocrine tumors and paragangliomas. Typical <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>of</b> the larynx is a particularly rare occurrence. We present a case of this rare disease, and review and discuss its diagnosis and treatment. Case presentation A 55 -year-old Turkish woman presented with a two-year history of persistent hoarseness. Endoscopic laryngeal examination and computed tomography revealed a supraglottic mass. Direct laryngoscopy was performed and a biopsy taken. Results of the histopathologic examination and immunohistochemical analysis were consistent with typical <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>of</b> the larynx. A supraglottic laryngectomy was performed. There was no recurrence during a follow-up period of three years. Conclusion <b>Carcinoid</b> <b>tumors</b> require an accurate diagnosis because of their varied clinical behavior and prognosis. A correct pathologic diagnosis is essential, differentiating the tumors from other neuroendocrine neoplasms and medullary cancer of the thyroid gland. Immunohistochemical analysis is supplementary to a standard histopathologic evaluation. Currently, conservative surgical resection without elective neck dissection is the recommended treatment for typical <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>of</b> the larynx. Additional cases and case series with long-term follow-up will be useful for understanding the nature <b>of</b> this <b>tumor</b> and should clarify the prognosis. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Carcinoid</b> <b>tumors</b> {{arise from}} argentaffine cells {{or from a}} {{primitive}} stem cells which may differentiate into anyone {{of a variety of}} adult endocrine-secreting cells. <b>Carcinoid</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>of</b> the pancreas is a very rare tumor with less than 50 cases reported in world literature. In literature it is denoted "pancreatic serotoninoma" or "serotonin-producing pancreatic tumor". Due to its rarity the tumor is an unusual cause of carcinoid syndrome. As the <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>of</b> the pancreas does not always causes carcinoid syndrome its absence does not necessarily exclude the existence <b>of</b> the <b>tumor.</b> The tumor is frequently malignant. Over 50 % of patients have metastases at the time of surgery. This is the reason why radical surgery is not possible in a number of patients. Excisional surgery offers the best chance for recovery or long term survival. We report on a 57 -year-old woman with carcinoid syndrome caused by malignant <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>of</b> the head of the pancreas without liver or other distant metastases; it was successfully excised with pylorus preserving cephalic duo-denopancreatectomy (after Longmire-Traverso) and radical lymphadenectomy.

NMO and NMO-spectrum disorders (NMO-SD) have been reported in autoimmune disorders, and are infrequently described as a paraneoplastic syndrome with cancers of lung, breast, and <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors</b> <b>of</b> the thyroid. We report a patient who presented with severe vomiting, blurring of vision, vertigo, diplopia, left hemiparesis and hemisensory loss and ataxia.

40|$|Abstract Background Primary <b>carcinoid</b> <b>tumors</b> <b>of</b> {{the liver}} are {{uncommon}} and rarely symptomatic.
