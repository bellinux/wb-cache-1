40|$|The price {{volatility}} of agricultural commodities assumes critical {{importance in the}} context of the ongoing debate regarding agricultural trade liberalisation in India. The arguments against agricultural trade liberalisation are often based on the issue of larger volatility in international markets. In order to make informed judgements about this crucial aspect of agriculture, which has implications for the entire economy, it is essential to study the volatility patterns in international and domestic markets in a comparative framework. The present study by CSC Sekhar is an attempt in this direction. The study, using monthly price data, finds little evidence to show that the international agricultural prices are uniformly more variable than the domestic prices. The study shows that the intra-year variability is higher in domestic markets while the inter-year variability is higher in the international markets. The <b>current</b> <b>bound</b> <b>rates</b> ofduty are generally found adequate in this study except in case of soybean oil and sugar. ...|$|R

40|$|Observations of {{peak and}} average {{currents}} {{are important for}} designed circuits, as faulty circuits have abnormal peaks and average <b>currents.</b> Using <b>current</b> <b>bounds</b> to detect faulty chips is a comparatively innovative idea, and many advanced schemes without them {{use it as a}} component in statistical outlier analysis. However, these previous research works have focused on the discussion of the testing impact without a proposed method to define reference <b>current</b> <b>bounds</b> to find faulty chips. A software framework is proposed to synthesize high-performance, power-performance optimized, noise-immune, and low-power circuits with current-bound estimations for testing. This framework offers a rapid methodology to quickly screen potential faulty chips by using the peak and average <b>current</b> <b>bounds</b> for different purposed circuits. The proposed estimation technique generates suitable reference <b>current</b> <b>bounds</b> from transistor threshold voltage and size adjustments. The SPICE-level simulation leads to the most accurate estimations. However, such simulations are not feasible for a large digital circuit. Hence, this work proposes constructing a feasible gate-level software framework for large digital circuits that will serve all of simulation purposes. In comparison with transistor-level Nanosim simulations, the proposed gate-level simulation framework has a margin of error of less than 2 % in the peak current, and the computation time is 334 times faster...|$|R
