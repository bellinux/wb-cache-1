5|$|UNITA and South African forces {{attacked}} the MPLA's base at Cuito Cuanavale in Cuando Cubango province from 13 January to 23 March 1988, {{in the second}} largest battle {{in the history of}} Africa, after the Battle of El Alamein, the largest in sub-Saharan Africa since World War II. Cuito Cuanavale's importance <b>came</b> <b>not</b> from its size or its wealth but its location. South African Defence Forces maintained an overwatch on the city using new, G5 artillery pieces. Both sides claimed victory in the ensuing Battle of Cuito Cuanavale.|$|E

25|$|Overall, {{perhaps two}} thirds of all Japanese {{military}} dead <b>came</b> <b>not</b> from combat, but from starvation and disease. In some cases this figure was potentially even higher, up to 80% in the Philippines and a staggering 97% in New Guinea.|$|E
25|$|After {{substantial}} Africanization of {{the civil}} service in 1952–60, the number of expatriates rose again from 1960 to 1965. Many of the new outside workers <b>came</b> <b>not</b> from the United Kingdom but from the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Italy, and the United Nations.|$|E
60|$|All these {{particular}} parts and qualities of faith {{are in that}} soul that comes to Jesus Christ for life, as is evident to any indifferent judgment. For, will he that believeth not the testimony of Christ concerning the baseness of sin, and the insufficiency of the righteousness of the world, come to Christ for life? No. He that believeth not this testimony of the word, <b>comes</b> <b>not.</b> He that believeth that there is life anywhere else, <b>comes</b> <b>not.</b> He that questions whether the Father hath given Christ power to forgive, <b>comes</b> <b>not.</b> He that thinketh {{that there is more}} in sin, in the law, in death, and the devil, to destroy, than there is in Christ to save, <b>comes</b> <b>not.</b> He also that questions his faithful management of his priesthood for the salvation of sinners, <b>comes</b> <b>not.</b>|$|R

60|$|Isen. Go to; the chafe <b>Comes</b> <b>not</b> {{by wearing}} chains, but feeling them.|$|R
25|$|Cha is {{from the}} Cantonese chàh of Guangzhou (Canton) and the ports of Hong Kong and Macau, also major points of contact, {{especially}} with the Portuguese, who spread it to India in the 16th century. The Korean and Japanese pronunciations of cha, however, <b>came</b> <b>not</b> from Cantonese, rather they were borrowed into Korean and Japanese during earlier periods of Chinese history.|$|E
25|$|Chan {{is deeply}} rooted in the teachings and doctrines of Mahāyāna Buddhism. What the Chan {{tradition}} emphasizes is that enlightenment of the Buddha <b>came</b> <b>not</b> through intellectual reasoning, but rather through self-realization in Dharma practice and meditation. Therefore, it is held that it is primarily through Dharma practice and meditation that others may attain enlightenment and become Buddhas as well.|$|E
25|$|However, {{since the}} U.S. grants {{tax breaks to}} nonprofits, it subsidizes relief efforts abroad, {{although}} other nations also subsidize charitable activity abroad. Most foreign aid (79%) <b>came</b> <b>not</b> from government sources but from private foundations, corporations, voluntary organizations, universities, religious organizations and individuals. According to the Index of Global Philanthropy, the United States is the top donor in absolute amounts.|$|E

25|$|The {{biggest threat}} {{to the lives of}} the tsar and his family, however, <b>came</b> <b>not</b> from terrorists, but from a {{derailment}} of the imperial train in the fall of 1888. Maria and her family had been at lunch in the dining car when the train jumped the tracks and slid down an embankment, causing the roof of the dining car to nearly cave in on them.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, other simple {{boarding}} {{houses were}} {{built on the}} strip of sand, with the activity attracting prominent businessmen from the Maryland Eastern Shore, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Wilmington. They <b>came</b> <b>not</b> so much to visit as to survey the spit. A {{decision was made to}} develop it and 250 lots were cut into it, and a corporation was formed to help with the development of the land. The corporation stock of 4,000 shares sold for $25 each.|$|E
25|$|By June 23, four {{bodies had}} been {{recovered}} from the scene by the Coast Guard and the Philippine Navy. Another 35 corpses and 40 survivors washed ashore at Burias Island, Masbate, the same day, but {{it is likely that}} the bodies <b>came</b> <b>not</b> only from the Princess of the Stars but also from other vessels that capsized in the typhoon. Some of the 40 survivors said they came from MV Lake Paway, which departed from Mindanao but later sank at sea.|$|E

25|$|While the British Army {{had earlier}} {{designated}} Penang Island as a fortress, Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival then ordered a withdrawal from Penang. Not {{only did the}} British Army abandon the Batu Maung Fort south of the city, they also covertly evacuated Penang's European population, leaving the rest of Penang's populace to their fates. Historians have since argued that the withdrawal and the silent evacuation of the white race led {{to the loss of}} the British sense of invincibility, and that the moral collapse of British rule in Southeast Asia <b>came</b> <b>not</b> in Singapore, but in Penang.|$|E
25|$|The German {{settlers}} came {{primarily from}} Russia, and after 1914 from German-American settlements in North and South Dakota. They <b>came</b> <b>not</b> as large groups but {{as part of}} a chain of family members, where the first immigrants would find suitable locations and send for the others. They formed compact German-speaking communities built around their Catholic or Lutheran churches, and continuing old-world customs. They were farmers who grew wheat. Arrivals from Russia, Bukovina, and Romanian Dobruja established their villages in a 40-mile-wide tract east of Regina.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, {{there was}} a {{controversy}} in Taiwan when parts of the civil service examination for judges were written in characters used only in Hokkien. After strong objections, these questions were not used in scoring. As with the official-language controversy, objections {{to the use of}} Taiwanese <b>came</b> <b>not</b> only from Mainlander groups, but also Hoklo, Hakka and aborigines. The Control Yuan later created a rule that only allowed Standard Mandarin characters on civil service exams. According to public opinion surveys, more people support making English the second official language than do for Taiwanese.|$|E

25|$|Radio {{astronomy}} {{was founded}} {{with the work}} of Karl Jansky in the early 1930s, while working for Bell Labs. He built a radio antenna to look at potential sources of interference for transatlantic radio transmissions. One of the sources of noise discovered <b>came</b> <b>not</b> from Earth, but {{from the center of the}} Milky Way, in the constellation Sagittarius. In 1942, JS Hey captured the sun's radio frequency using military radar receivers. Radio spectroscopy started with the discovery of the 21-centimeter HI line in 1951.|$|E
25|$|Morgan {{made his}} One Day International debut for Ireland on 5 August 2006 at the European Championships against Scotland. He fell one run {{short of a}} century, scoring 99 before he was run out. It {{was the first time}} in ODI history that a player had been {{dismissed}} for 99 on debut. Only two other batsmen passed 20 as Ireland beat Scotland by 85 runs. His maiden ODI hundred <b>came</b> <b>not</b> long after, on 4 February 2007 against Canada in Nairobi. At the time he was the youngest ever non-subcontinental player to make a century in ODI cricket, a record subsequently beaten by two other players.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} single alteration to {{the design}} however, <b>came</b> <b>not</b> directly from Stimers but from Admiral Joseph Smith, chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks in Washington, D.C., who suggested that the oval hull of the ship be surrounded by large iron tanks which could be pumped full of water in order to lower the ship's freeboard still further when in combat to present an even smaller target, or drained for normal travel. Stimers liked the idea and ordered the changes, but when Ericsson saw the new plans he resigned from the project. The new plans greatly added {{to the design}}'s complexity, requiring sophisticated pumping mechanisms, while the added weight would also reduce speed and buoyancy.|$|E
