25|$|Items {{that are}} {{particularly}} sensitive to static discharge may {{be treated with}} the application of an antistatic agent, which adds a conducting surface layer that ensures any excess charge is evenly distributed. Fabric softeners and dryer sheets used in washing machines and <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers</b> are {{an example of an}} antistatic agent used to prevent and remove static cling.|$|E
25|$|A 30A, 4-wire {{single-phase}} grounding socket {{is often}} used for electric <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers.</b> 240 volts from the split phase system {{is used for the}} heating elements, and the motor and controls run on 120 volts. These plugs have blades that are rather larger than NEMA 5-20, are more widely spaced, and are angled so as to prevent using the wrong plug in the wrong circuit. These plugs have L-shaped neutral blades that will not fit in a NEMA 14-50 receptacle.|$|E

25|$|Earlier, {{household}} <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers</b> sometimes {{incorporated a}} germicidal lamp {{in series with}} an ordinary incandescent lamp; the incandescent lamp operated as the ballast for the germicidal lamp. A commonly used light in the home in the 1960s in 220–240V countries was a circleline tube ballasted by an under-run regular mains filament lamp. Self ballasted mercury-vapor lamps incorporate ordinary tungsten filaments within the overall envelope of the lamp to act as the ballast, and it supplements the otherwise lacking red area of the light spectrum produced.|$|E
25|$|In cold climates heating air {{and water}} is a major demand on {{household}} energy use. By investing in newer technologies in the home, significant energy reductions are possible. Heat pumps are a more efficient alternative to using electrical resistance heaters for warming air or water. A variety of efficient <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers</b> are available, and the classic clothes line requires no energy, only time. Natural gas condensing boilers and hot air furnaces increase efficiency over standard hot flue models. New construction implementing heat exchangers can capture heat from waste water or exhaust air in bathrooms, laundry and kitchens.|$|E
25|$|Example 3: A {{potential}} use of event-driven SOA {{could be}} a virtual electricity market where home <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers</b> can bid {{on the price of}} the electricity they use in a real-time market pricing system. The real-time market price and control system could turn home electricity customers into active participants in managing the power grid and their monthly utility bills. Customers can set limits on how much they would pay for electricity to run a clothes dryer, for example, and electricity providers willing to transmit power at that price would be alerted over the grid and could sell the electricity to the dryer.|$|E

25|$|The {{electrical}} contacts may control the power directly (as {{in a household}} iron) or indirectly, switching electrical power through a relay or the supply of natural gas or fuel oil through an electrically operated valve. In some natural gas heaters the power may be provided with a thermocouple that is heated by a pilot light (a small, continuously burning, flame). In devices without pilot lights for ignition (as in most modern gas <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers</b> and some natural gas heaters and decorative fireplaces) the power for the contacts is provided by reduced household electrical power that operates a relay controlling an electronic ignitor, either a resistance heater or an electrically powered spark generating device.|$|E

2500|$|... "All-copper" [...] {{building}} wiring {{is a term}} that refers to buildings in which the inside electrical service is carried exclusively over copper wiring.

2500|$|... 10/3 {{with ground}} (also written [...] "10-3 w/gnd") is a {{nonmetallic}} sheathed bundle of four solid 10 AWG wires having a bare ground and three insulated conductors twisted into a round-shaped NM-B orange-colored sheath.

2500|$|Relying on {{the neutral}} {{conductor}} was a legal grounding method for electric ranges and <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers,</b> under the National Electrical Code from the 1947 to the 1996 editions. Since North American dryers and ranges have certain components (timers, lights, fans, etc.) {{that run on}} 120V, {{this means that the}} neutral wire indirectly used for grounding would also carry current, even under non-fault conditions. Although this is contrary to modern grounding practice, such [...] "grandfathered" [...] installations remain common in older homes in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|The NEMA 14 {{devices are}} {{four-wire}} grounding devices (hot-hot-neutral-ground) available in ratings from 15 to 60A. The voltage rating is 250V.

The 14-30 {{is used for}} electric <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers,</b> the 14-50 is used for electric cooking ranges, and either may {{also be used for}} home charging of electric vehicles. The NEMA 14 connectors are essentially the replacements for the older NEMA 10 connectors described above, but {{with the addition of a}} dedicated grounding connection.|$|E

2500|$|NEMA 10 {{connectors}} are a now deprecated {{type that}} had formerly been {{popular in the}} United States for use with high-wattage electric <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers</b> and kitchen ranges; NEMA 14-30R and -50R connectors are now generally used for these applications. NEMA 10s are classified as 125/250V non-grounding (hot-hot-neutral), and were designed {{to be used in}} a manner that indirectly grounds the appliance frame, though not {{in a manner consistent with}} most modern practice. [...] The older practice was common before the requirement of a separate safety ground was incorporated in the National Electrical Code.|$|E
2500|$|Natural gas {{dispensed}} in {{a residential}} setting can generate temperatures in excess of 1100°C (2000°F) making it a powerful domestic cooking and heating fuel. In much of the developed world it is supplied through pipes to homes, where it is used for many purposes including ranges and ovens, gas-heated <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers,</b> heating/cooling, and central heating. Heaters in homes and other buildings may include boilers, furnaces, and water heaters. Both North America and Europe are major consumers of natural gas. Boilers use low pressure, usually 6 to 7 inches of water (6" [...] to 7" [...] WC), which is about 0.25 psig. The pressures in the supply lines under the streets vary, either utilization pressure (UP, the aforementioned 6" [...] to 7" [...] WC) or elevated pressure (EP), which may be anywhere from 1 psig to 120 psig. Systems using EP have a regulator at the service entrance to step down the pressure to UP.|$|E
