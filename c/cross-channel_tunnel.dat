50|$|The first TBM that {{tunneled}} {{a substantial}} distance {{was invented in}} 1863 and improved in 1875 by British Army officer Major Frederick Edward Blackett Beaumont (1833-1895); Beaumont's machine was further improved in 1880 by British Army officer Major Thomas English (1843-1935). In 1875, the French National Assembly approved {{the construction of a}} tunnel under the English Channel and the British Parliament allowed a trial run to be made; English's TBM was chosen for the project. The cutting head of English's TBM consisted of a conical drill bit behind which were a pair of opposing arms on which were mounted cutting discs. From June 1882 to March 1883, the machine tunneled, through chalk, a total of 6,036 feet (1.84 km). However, despite this success, the <b>cross-Channel</b> <b>tunnel</b> project was abandoned in 1883 after the British military raised fears that the tunnel might be used as an invasion route. Nevertheless, in 1883, this TBM was used to bore a railway ventilation tunnel — 7 feet (2.1 m) in diameter and 6,750 feet (2 km) long — between Birkenhead and Liverpool, England, through sandstone under the Mersey River.|$|E

Mathieu-Favier's design envisaged a bored two-level tunnel with the top tunnel used for transport and the bottom one for groundwater flows.|$|E
50|$|His older brother, Jules, {{was also}} a painter and gave him his first lessons, {{although}} he was largely self-taught. His younger brother, Ludovic, was an engineer {{who was in charge}} of drilling for the first attempt to build a <b>cross-channel</b> railway <b>tunnel.</b>|$|R
25|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Concession, Eurotunnel was obliged to {{investigate}} a <b>cross-Channel</b> road <b>tunnel.</b> In December 1999 road and rail tunnel proposals were presented to the British and French governments, but it was stressed that there was not enough demand for a second tunnel. A three-way treaty between the United Kingdom, France and Belgium governs border controls, with the establishment of control zones wherein the officers of the other nation may exercise limited customs and law enforcement powers. For most purposes these are {{at either end of the}} tunnel, with the French border controls on the UK side of the tunnel and vice versa. For some city-to-city trains, the train is a control zone. A binational emergency plan coordinates UK and French emergency activities.|$|R
2500|$|Around 1866, William Low and Sir John Hawkshaw {{promoted}} ideas, but {{apart from}} preliminary geological studies none were implemented. An official Anglo-French protocol was established in 1876 for a <b>cross-Channel</b> railway <b>tunnel.</b> In 1881, the British railway entrepreneur Sir Edward Watkin and Alexandre Lavalley, a French Suez Canal contractor, were in the Anglo-French Submarine Railway Company that conducted exploratory work {{on both sides of}} the Channel. On the English side a [...] diameter Beaumont-English boring machine dug a [...] pilot tunnel from Shakespeare Cliff. On the French side, a similar machine dug [...] from Sangatte. The project was abandoned in May 1882, owing to British political and press campaigns asserting that a tunnel would compromise Britain's national defences. These early works were encountered more than a century later during the TML project.|$|R
