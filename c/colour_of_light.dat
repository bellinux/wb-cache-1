5|$|Some animals {{including}} cephalopods like squid {{are able}} to vary their colours rapidly for both camouflage and signalling. The mechanisms include reversible proteins which can be switched between two configurations. The configuration of reflectin proteins in chromatophore cells in {{the skin of the}} Doryteuthis pealeii squid is controlled by electric charge. When charge is absent, the proteins stack together tightly, forming a thin, more reflective layer; when charge is present, the molecules stack more loosely, forming a thicker layer. Since chromatophores contain multiple reflectin layers, the switch changes the layer spacing and hence the <b>colour</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> that is reflected.|$|E

Hues of blue include indigo and ultramarine, closer to violet; pure blue, without any mixture of other colours; Cyan, which is midway on the spectrum between blue and green, and the other blue-greens turquoise, teal, and aquamarine.|$|E

It was first codified in the 1949 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic and later {{specified in the}} 1968 United Nations Convention on Road Traffic. Generally, but with some regional exceptions, lamps facing rearward must emit red light, lamps facing sideward and all turn signals must emit amber light, while lamps facing frontward must emit white or selective yellow light. No other colours are permitted except on emergency vehicles.|$|E

2500|$|Until {{the advent}} of the atomic clock, the most {{reliable}} timekeeper available to mankind was the Earth's rotation. It was natural therefore that the astronomers {{under the auspices of the}} International Astronomical Union (IAU) took the lead in maintaining the standards relating to time. In 1958, in anticipation of technology being able to measure the rate at which the Earth is slowing down, it was agreed that the second would be defined on the basis that in 1900 the Earth's average rotational speed gave an average day of exactly 60×60×24 = 86,400seconds. [...] Astronomers from the US Naval Observatory (USNO) and the National Physical Laboratory determined a relationship between the frequency of a specific <b>colour</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> emitted by an excited caesium-133 atom and the back-calculated rate of rotation of the Earth in 1900. [...] Their value was adopted in 1968 by the 13th CGPM as being the definition of the second.|$|E

His visage, which was of the <b>colour</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> porphyry, had little of its original surface left; it was a face which had been the plaything of strange fires or pestilences, that had moulded to whatever shape they chose his originally supple skin, and left it pitted, puckered, and seamed like a dried water-course. But though dire catastrophes or the treacherous airs of remote climates had done their worst upon his exterior, they seemed to have affected him but little within, to judge from a certain robustness which showed itself in his manner of standing.|$|E

50|$|Photographic {{lighting}} is the illumination of scenes to be photographed. A photograph simply records patterns of light, colour, and shade; {{lighting is}} all-important in controlling the image. In many cases even illumination is desired {{to give an}} accurate rendition of the scene. In other cases the direction, brightness, and <b>colour</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> are manipulated for effect. Lighting is particularly important for monochrome photography, {{where there is no}} colour information, only the interplay of highlights and shadows. Lighting and exposure are used to create effects such as low-key and high-key.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{case study}} of the role of feeling and will in {{interaction}} with children with autism. It investigates the use <b>of</b> changing <b>colours</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> for enhancement <b>of</b> engagement at this level. The research was carried out in a specially designed room where the whole interior colour could be changed using dimmer-controlled lights. 19 children aged between 8 and 17 years with a diagnosis of severe autism were involved in the study. Data were collected using video recordings, a research diary and small-scale informal interviews and were analysed by quantitative and qualitative methods. Three main stages were developed. These involved observations of behaviour of children in different <b>colours</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> <b>of</b> children interacting directly with changing coloured <b>light,</b> and <b>of</b> intensive interaction augmented by changing colour moods. The main findings were that colour could affect behaviour and that in general reds were more arousing than blues and greens. Some children engaged readily in interaction with changing coloured lights, though many did not. When changing colour was used in conjunction with intentional creation of affect by an adult during intensive interaction, improvements in social engagement and communication skills were observed.
