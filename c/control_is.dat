5|$|Biological <b>control</b> <b>is</b> {{a method}} of {{controlling}} pests such as insects, mites, weeds and plant diseases using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory, or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. It {{can be an important}} component of integrated pest management (IPM) programs.|$|E
5|$|Birth <b>control</b> <b>is</b> {{also being}} {{considered}} {{as an alternative}} to hunting as a means of controlling overpopulation in wild animals. Contraceptive vaccines {{have been found to be}} effective in a number of different animal populations. Kenyan goat herders fix a skirt, called an olor, to male goats to prevent them from impregnating female goats.|$|E
5|$|Birth control, {{also known}} as {{contraception}} and fertility <b>control,</b> <b>is</b> a method or device used to prevent pregnancy. Birth control has been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods of birth control only became available in the 20th century. Planning, making available, and using birth <b>control</b> <b>is</b> called family planning. Some cultures limit or discourage access to birth control because they consider it to be morally, religiously, or politically undesirable.|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} distinction within self-control, between {{stop control}} and start <b>control,</b> <b>was</b> investigated in two studies. Study 1 {{consisted of a}} pilot study in which expert ratings of existing self-control items were used to distinguish between stop and start control items and a confirmatory factor analyses of these items using a student sample (N = 474). Also, stop and start <b>control</b> <b>were</b> related to overall affect and behavioural outcomes. Stop <b>control</b> <b>was</b> negatively related to negative affect, whereas start <b>control</b> <b>was</b> positively related to positive affect. Study 2 (N = 226) replicated some of these findings; stop <b>control</b> <b>was</b> the best predictor (−) of smoking and alcohol consumption whereas start <b>control</b> <b>was</b> the best predictor (+) of exercising and studying...|$|R

5|$|If {{pregnancy}} {{is a high}} concern using two methods {{at the same time}} is reasonable, and two forms of birth <b>control</b> <b>is</b> recommended in those taking the anti-acne drug isotretinoin, due to the high risk of birth defects if taken during pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Men wear tzitzit {{on their}} African print shirts, women follow the niddah (biblical laws {{concerning}} menstruation), and newborn boys are circumcised. In {{accordance with their}} interpretation of the Bible, the Black Hebrews follow a strictly vegan diet and only wear natural fabrics. Most men {{have more than one}} wife, and birth <b>control</b> <b>is</b> not permitted.|$|E
5|$|North American {{predators and}} parasitoids can {{occasionally}} cause high emerald ash borer mortality, but generally offer only limited control. Mortality due to native woodpeckers is variable. Parasitism by parasitoids such as Atanycolus cappaerti can be high, but overall such <b>control</b> <b>is</b> generally low.|$|E

5|$|The body {{interacts with}} nature, and removes liquids and excretes waste through nine holes. The aim of pranayama (breath <b>control)</b> <b>is</b> to purify the {{channels}} and nourish the inner body with vital airs. This benefits a yogi and yogini in preventing and curing diseases, {{as well as}} preparing the mind for meditation.|$|E
5|$|The {{first step}} in symptom <b>control</b> <b>is</b> {{drainage}} of cerebrospinal fluid by lumbar puncture. If necessary, this may be performed {{at the same time}} as a diagnostic LP (such as done in search of a CSF infection). In some cases, this is sufficient to control the symptoms, and no further treatment is needed.|$|E

5|$|A {{measure of}} William's success in taking <b>control</b> <b>is</b> that, from 1072 until the Capetian conquest of Normandy in 1204, William and his successors were largely {{absentee}} rulers. For example, after 1072, William {{spent more than}} 75 per cent {{of his time in}} France rather than England. While he needed to be personally present in Normandy to defend the realm from foreign invasion and put down internal revolts, he set up royal administrative structures that enabled him to rule England from a distance.|$|E

50|$|Flying <b>controls</b> <b>were</b> {{essentially}} conventional with fin, rudder, all-flying tailplane, and ailerons on {{the outer}} panels on the 1921 version. For the 1922 competition outer panels of increased area and wing-warping <b>control</b> <b>were</b> introduced.|$|R
5|$|Another {{instance}} of population <b>control</b> <b>is</b> {{the prevalence of}} female infanticide. People in rural areas practiced female infanticide and selective neglect due to a preference of sons over daughters. Since the 1980s, roughly 200,000 female infants would be killed per {{year because of the}} preference for male children and the advancement in technologies such as ultrasound, which help to find out the sex of the fetus. In addition to female infanticide, girls are being unregistered or are abandoned by their families, which stops them from receiving education and legal benefits the government offered. These methods of controlling population have resulted in a huge gender gap in China.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, 57% {{of women}} of childbearing age want to avoid {{pregnancy}} (867 of 1520million). About 222 million women however were not able to access birth control, 53million of whom were in sub-Saharan Africa and 97million of whom were in Asia. This results in 54million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year. Part of the reason that many women are without birth <b>control</b> <b>is</b> that many countries limit access due to religious or political reasons, while another contributor is poverty. Due to restrictive abortion laws in Sub-Saharan Africa, many women turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy, resulting in about 2–4% obtaining unsafe abortions each year.|$|E
5|$|Biological <b>control</b> <b>is</b> first {{recorded}} around 300 AD in China, when colonies of weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina, were intentionally placed in citrus plantations to control beetles and caterpillars. Also in China, ducks {{were used in}} paddy fields to consume pests, as illustrated in ancient cave art. In 1762, an Indian mynah was brought to Mauritius to control locusts, and about the same time, citrus trees in Burma were connected by bamboos to allow ants to pass between them and help control caterpillars. In the 1880s, ladybirds were used in citrus plantations in California to control scale insects, and other biological control experiments followed. The introduction of DDT, a cheap and effective compound, put an effective stop to biological control experiments. By the 1960s, problems of resistance to chemicals and damage to the environment began to emerge, and biological control had a renaissance. Chemical pest <b>control</b> <b>is</b> still the predominant type of pest control today, although {{a renewed interest in}} traditional and biological pest control developed {{towards the end of the}} 20th century and continues to this day.|$|E
40|$|ActiveX <b>controls</b> can <b>be</b> {{placed in}} Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint slides orWeb Forms applications. These <b>controls</b> <b>are</b> {{selected}} from the Toolbox and they allow userinteraction. A control has adjustable attributes (properties) and it detects events (it <b>is</b> “alive”). <b>Controls</b> <b>are</b> associated with code sequences, {{in the form of}} certain procedures, called eventprocedures...|$|R
50|$|Administrative <b>controls</b> <b>are</b> {{fourth in}} larger {{hierarchy}} of hazard controls, which ranks the effectiveness {{and efficiency of}} hazard <b>controls.</b> Administrative <b>controls</b> <b>are</b> more effective than PPE because they involve some manner of prior planning and avoidance, whereas PPE only serves only as a final barrier between the hazard and worker. Administrative <b>controls</b> <b>are</b> second lowest because they require workers or employers to actively think or comply with regulations and do not offer permanent solutions to problems. Generally, administrative <b>controls</b> <b>are</b> cheaper to begin, but they may become more expensive over time as higher failure rates {{and the need for}} constant training or re-certification eclipse the initial investments of the three more desirable hazard controls in the hierarchy. The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends administrative controls when hazards cannot be removed or changed, and engineering <b>controls</b> <b>are</b> not practical.|$|R
30|$|For each {{product and}} for each OH treatment, ten {{cylinders}} (9  mm height, 30  mm diameter) of unfrozen <b>controls</b> <b>were</b> prepared, using a circular cutter made on purpose. Totally, ninety cylinders of unfrozen <b>controls</b> <b>were</b> prepared.|$|R
5|$|Birth <b>control</b> <b>is</b> another consideration: {{women with}} SCI {{are usually not}} {{prescribed}} oral contraceptives since the hormones in them {{increase the risk of}} blood clots, for which people with SCI are already at elevated risk. Intrauterine devices could have dangerous complications that could go undetected if sensation is reduced. Diaphrams that require something to be inserted into the vagina are not usable by people with poor hand function. An option of choice for women is for partners to use condoms.|$|E
5|$|<b>Control</b> <b>is</b> {{the third}} studio album by American {{recording}} artist Janet Jackson, released on February 4, 1986, by A Records. Her collaborations with the songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis {{resulted in an}} unconventional sound: a fusion of rhythm and blues, rap vocals, funk, disco and synthesized percussion that established Jackson, Jam and Lewis as the leading innovators of contemporary R. The album became Jackson's commercial breakthrough and enabled her to transition into the popular music market, with Control {{becoming one of the}} foremost albums of the 1980s and contemporary music.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock), a {{biomedical}} engineer from Lake Zurich, Illinois, is {{aboard the}} NASA Space Shuttle Explorer {{for her first}} space mission, STS-157. Veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (Clooney) is commanding his final mission. During a spacewalk to service the Hubble Space Telescope, Mission Control in Houston warns the team about a Russian missile strike on a defunct satellite, which has inadvertently caused a chain reaction forming a cloud of debris in space. Mission Control orders that the mission be aborted and the crew begin re-entry immediately because the debris is speeding towards the Shuttle. Communication with Mission <b>Control</b> <b>is</b> lost shortly thereafter.|$|E
