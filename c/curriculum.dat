5|$|The first president, Joseph R. Williams, {{designed}} a <b>curriculum</b> that required more scientific study than practically any undergraduate {{institution of the}} era. It balanced science, liberal arts, and practical training. The <b>curriculum</b> excluded Latin and Greek studies since most applicants did not study any classical languages in their rural high schools. However, it did require three hours of daily manual labor, which kept costs down for both {{the students and the}} College. Despite Williams' innovations and his defense of education for the masses, the State Board of Education saw Williams' <b>curriculum</b> as elitist. They forced him to resign in 1859 and reduced the <b>curriculum</b> to a two-year vocational program.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Stephen E. Loeb {{proposed}} that accounting ethics education should include seven goals (adapted {{from a list}} by Daniel Callahan). To implement these goals, {{he pointed out that}} accounting ethics could be taught throughout accounting <b>curriculum</b> or in an individual class tailored to the subject. Requiring it be taught throughout the <b>curriculum</b> would necessitate all accounting teachers to have knowledge on the subject (which may require training). A single course has issues as to where to include the course in a student's education (for example, before preliminary accounting classes or near the end of a student's degree requirements), whether there is enough material to cover in a semester class, and whether most universities have room in a four-year <b>curriculum</b> for a single class on the subject.|$|E

5|$|More {{accelerated}} {{classes were}} added, but {{the core of}} the gifted <b>curriculum</b> remained the individualized approaches and learning by doing that had long been central to the Avery Coonley <b>curriculum.</b> Nature study was still prominent in the student's activities, with music, art, and drama. The traditional learning themes and school projects involving maple trees, Native Americans, ancient Egypt and other topics were preserved but adapted to serve the gifted <b>curriculum.</b> In early 1980, an early childhood (EC) program for three-year-olds was launched, designed to cater to the needs of gifted preschool children and prepare them to transition from home to kindergarten. Again departing from the prevailing educational theory, Avery Coonley introduced academics in the EC program, with the same focus on nature, music, movement, and practical skills as the higher grades.|$|E

All 3- and 4-year-old children in Scotland are entitled to a free nursery place. Formal primary education begins at approximately 5 years old and lasts for 7 years (P1–P7); children in Scotland study Standard Grades, or Intermediate qualifications between the ages of 14 and 16. These are being phased out and replaced by the National Qualifications of the <b>Curriculum</b> for Excellence. The school leaving age is 16, after which students may choose to remain at school and study for Access, Intermediate or Higher Grade and Advanced Higher qualifications.
