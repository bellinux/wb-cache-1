5|$|An M24x2 {{male thread}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>valve</b> was {{supplied}} with some Dräger semi-closed circuit recreational rebreathers (Dräger Ray) {{for use with}} nitrox mixtures. The regulator supplied with the rebreather had a compatible connection.|$|E
5|$|DIN {{screw thread}} {{connectors}} - the regulator screws into the <b>cylinder</b> <b>valve</b> trapping the O-ring securely between the sealing {{face of the}} valve and the O-ring groove in the regulator. These are more reliable than A-clamps because the O-ring is well protected, but many countries do not use DIN fittings widely on compressors, or cylinders which have DIN fittings, so a diver traveling abroad with a DIN system may need to take an adaptor, either for connecting the DIN regulator to a rented cylinder, or for connecting an A-clamp filler hose to a DIN <b>cylinder</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{functional}} diving cylinder {{consists of}} a pressure vessel and a <b>cylinder</b> <b>valve.</b> There are usually one or more optional accessories depending on the specific application.|$|E

5|$|A valve failed on a diver’s {{emergency}} cylinder on {{a diving}} support vessel during {{preparation for a}} dive injuring five divers. The <b>cylinder</b> <b>valve</b> was ejected at 180 bar due to incompatible thread. Pillar valve was M25x2 parallel thread and cylinder was a 3/4″x14 BSP parallel thread.|$|E
5|$|DIN valves are {{produced}} in 200 bar and 300 bar pressure ratings. The {{number of threads}} and the detail configuration of the connections is designed to prevent incompatible combinations of filler attachment or regulator attachment with the <b>cylinder</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
5|$|Empty {{scuba tanks}} or scuba tanks {{pressurized}} {{at less than}} 200kPa are not restricted as hazardous materials.

5|$|Adaptors are {{available}} to allow connection of DIN regulators to yoke <b>cylinder</b> <b>valves</b> (A-clamp or yoke adaptor), and to connect yoke regulators to DIN <b>cylinder</b> <b>valves.</b> (plug adaptors and block adaptors) Plug adaptors are rated for 232/240 bar, and can only be used with valves which are designed to accept them. Block adaptors are generally rated for 200 bar, {{and can be used}} with almost any 200 bar DIN valve.|$|R

5|$|Yoke valves {{are rated}} between 200 and 240 bar, and {{there does not}} appear to be any {{mechanical}} design detail preventing connection between any yoke fittings, though some older yoke clamps will not fit over the popular 232/240 bar combination DIN/yoke <b>cylinder</b> <b>valve</b> as the yoke is too narrow.|$|E
5|$|Cylinders {{should not}} be left {{standing}} unattended unless secured {{so that they can}} not fall in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the <b>cylinder</b> <b>valve</b> mechanism, and conceivably fracture the valve at the neck threads. This is more likely with taper thread valves, and when it happens most of the energy of the compressed gas is released within a second, and can accelerate the cylinder to speeds which can cause severe injury or damage to the surroundings.|$|E
5|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{are filled}} by attaching a high-pressure gas {{supply to the}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>valve,</b> opening the valve and allowing gas to flow into the cylinder until the desired pressure is reached, then closing the valves, venting the connection and disconnecting it. This process involves a risk of the cylinder or the filling equipment failing under pressure, {{both of which are}} hazardous to the operator, so procedures to control these risks are generally followed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cylinder</b> <b>valves</b> are {{classified}} by four basic aspects: the thread specification, {{the connection to}} the regulator, pressure rating, and distinguishing features.|$|R

5000|$|That {{the bailout}} {{cylinders}} are fit for use, contain {{enough of the}} appropriate gas for the planned dive, and the <b>cylinder</b> <b>valves</b> function correctly.|$|R
5|$|Some {{national}} standards {{require that the}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>valve</b> includes a bursting disk, a pressure relief device that will release the gas before the cylinder fails {{in the event of}} overpressurization. If a bursting disk ruptures during a dive the entire contents of the cylinder will be lost in a very short time. The risk of this happening to a correctly rated disc, in good condition, on a correctly filled cylinder is very low.|$|E
5|$|Tank {{bursting}} due to overpressure may {{be prevented}} by a pressure-relief burst disc fitted to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>valve,</b> which bursts if the cylinder is overpressurised and vents air {{at a rapid}} controlled rate to prevent catastrophic tank failure. Accidental rupture of the burst disc can also occur during filling, due to corrosive weakening or stress from repeated pressurization cycles, but is remedied by replacement of the disc. Bursting discs are not required in all jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{commonly}} used configurations of manifold. The oldest type is a tube with a connector on each end which {{is attached to}} the <b>cylinder</b> <b>valve</b> outlet, and an outlet connection in the middle, to which the regulator is attached. A variation on this pattern includes a reserve valve at the outlet connector. The cylinders are isolated from the manifold when closed, and the manifold can be attached or disconnected while the cylinders are pressurised.|$|E

5|$|These {{are used}} to cover the <b>{{cylinder}}</b> <b>valve</b> orifice when the cylinder is not in use to prevent dust, water or other materials from contaminating the orifice. They can also help prevent the O-ring of a yoke type valve from falling out. The plug may be vented so that the leakage of gas from the cylinder does not pressurise the plug, {{making it difficult to}} remove.|$|E
5|$|International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air {{states that}} {{provided}} that pressure in diving cylinders {{is less than}} , these can be carried as checked in or carry-on baggage. It maybe necessary to empty the cylinder to verify this. Once emptied, the <b>cylinder</b> <b>valve</b> should be closed to prevent moisture entering the cylinder. Security restrictions implemented by individual countries may further limit or forbid the carriage of some items permitted by ICAO, and airlines and security screening agencies {{have the right to}} refuse the carriage of certain items.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>cylinder</b> <b>valve</b> {{models have}} axial {{spindles}} - {{in line with}} the cylinder axis, and are not handed. Standard side-spindle valves have the valve knob on the diver's right side when back-mounted. Side-spindle valves used with manifolds must be a handed pair - one with the knob to the right and the other with the knob to the left, but in all cases the valve is opened by turning the knob anticlockwise, and closed by turning it clockwise. This is the convention with almost all valves for all purposes. Left hand side-spindle valves are used by sidemount divers.|$|E
40|$|Uranium hexafluoride (UF{sub 6 }) <b>cylinder</b> <b>valves</b> have, {{like the}} cylinders, been in use and/or storage for periods ranging from 15 to 44 years. Visual {{inspection}} of the cylinders {{has shown that the}} extent of corrosion and the overall cylinder condition varies widely throughout the storage yards. One area of concern is the integrity of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>valves.</b> Visual inspection has found deposits which have been identified as radioactive material on or near the valves. These deposits suggest leakage of UF{sub 6 } and may indicate valve degradation; however, these deposits may simply be residual material from cylinder filling operations...|$|R

50|$|A {{pneumatic}} lubricator injects an aerosolized {{stream of}} oil into an air line to provide lubrication {{to the internal}} working parts of pneumatic tools, and to other devices such as actuating <b>cylinders,</b> <b>valves</b> and motors.|$|R
5|$|Contamination {{by water}} during filling {{may be due}} to two causes. Inadequate {{filtration}} and drying of the compressed air can introduce small quantities of fresh water condensate, or an emulsion of water and compressor lubricant, and failing to clear the <b>cylinder</b> <b>valve</b> orifice of water which may have dripped from wet dive gear, which can allow contamination by fresh or seawater. Both cause corrosion, but seawater contamination can cause a cylinder to corrode rapidly {{to the extent that it}} may be unsafe or condemned after even a fairly short period. This problem is exacerbated in hot climates, where chemical reactions are faster, and is more prevalent where filling staff are badly trained or overworked.|$|E
5|$|Open circuit scuba divers by {{definition}} {{are independent of}} surface supply, and must take any gas mixture with them {{that is to be}} used on the dive. However, if they are confident of returning by a specific route, the decompression gas may be stored at appropriate places on that route. The cylinders used for this purpose are called stage cylinders, and they are usually provided with a standard regulator and a submersible pressure gauge, and are usually left at the stop with the regulator pressurized, but the <b>cylinder</b> <b>valve</b> turned off to minimize the risk of gas loss. Similar cylinders are carried by the divers when the route back is not secure. They are commonly mounted as sling cylinders, clipped to D-rings at the sides of the diver's harness.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>cylinder</b> <b>valve</b> or pillar valve is to control gas flow {{to and from the}} {{pressure}} vessel and to provide a connection with the regulator or filling hose. Cylinder valves are usually machined from brass and finished by a protective and decorative layer of chrome plating. A metal or plastic dip tube or valve snorkel screwed {{into the bottom of the}} valve extends into the cylinder to reduce the risk of liquid or particulate contaminants in the cylinder getting into the gas passages when the cylinder is inverted, and blocking or jamming the regulator. Some of these dip tubes have a plain opening, but some have an integral filter.|$|E
50|$|A {{significant}} difference between the Paget and a steam motor locomotive is that the Paget valvegear was driven centrally, every <b>cylinder's</b> <b>valve</b> being driven by geared shafts from a single jackshaft that was in-turn driven by the coupling rods.|$|R
50|$|The intake valves were {{operated}} by the suction caused by the intake stroke, while the exhaust valves were {{operated by}} an eccentric brass ring on the rear wheel and a device at the cylinder head that opened each <b>cylinder's</b> <b>valve</b> alternately.|$|R
50|$|Only {{one type}} of 4-12-2 was built: the Union Pacific Railroad's 9000-series {{locomotives}}, 88 of which were built by ALCO between 1926 and 1930. These locomotives were used {{to increase the speed}} of freight trains in flat country, and were fairly successful, but were maintenance nightmares, largely because of their use of an inside third cylinder driving the cranked second driving axle between the frames. There was no inside valve gear to worry about, however. ALCO had obtained permission to use the conjugated valve gear invented by Sir Nigel Gresley. This system used two hinged levers connected to the outer <b>cylinder's</b> <b>valves</b> to operate the inner <b>cylinder's</b> <b>valve.</b> The 9000 class locomotives were the largest to use Gresley gear.|$|R
