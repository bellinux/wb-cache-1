40|$|Gas oils, used to {{manufacture}} diesel fuel and residential heating oil, are complex hydrocarbon substances with carbon numbers of C 9 -C 30 and boiling ranges of approximately 150 C to 450 C. Target organ (liver enlargement, reduced thymus weights, and reductions in hematological parameters) and developmental (reduced fetal viability, increased resorption frequency, and reduced fetal weights) effects {{are associated with}} aromatic constituents present in some gas oils. Two types of gas oils were tested for repeated-dose and developmental toxicity following repeated dermal administration. A blend of commercial diesel fuels contain-ing 26 % aromatics, primarily single-ring compounds, did not cause either target organ or developmental effects at levels up to 600 mg/kg/d. ‘‘Cracked’ ’ gas oils containing higher levels of aromatic constituents were also tested. Because of limited sample availability, 2 <b>cracked</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> samples were tested, one for systemic effects {{and the other for}} developmental toxicity. The sample tested in the repeated-dose toxicity study (81 % aromatics including approximately 10 % 3 -ring compounds) produced increased liver weights, reduced thymus weights, and reductions in hematological parameters. The overall no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was 100 mg/kg/d. The sample tested for developmental toxicity (65 % aromatics including approximately 5 % 3 -ring compounds) resulted in significant reductions in fetal survival, significant increases in resorption frequency, and significant reductions in fetal weights with an overall NOAEL of 100 mg/kg/d. In summary, gas oils may or may not cause target organ and/or developmental effects depending on the levels and types of aromatic constituents that they contain...|$|E

40|$|It is the {{consensus}} that sapropelic matter generated oil initially, subsequently, the <b>oil</b> <b>cracked</b> into <b>gas</b> {{in the process}} of hydrocarbon generation evolution; however, there exist a dispute considering how much gas is generated directly by kerogen as well as how to identify it. The experimental samples are low mature sapropelic shale from the Xiamaling Formation in North China; the experimental devices are high-temperature and high pressured golden tube system and normal autoclave thermal simulation; gas generation simulation experiments of original kerogen, residual kerogen and oil from the same shale are developed. It is concluded that: (1) the gas generated from kerogen directly accounts for about 20 % after the oil generation peak period. The main gas generating stage is from 422  °C to 566  °C (RO =  1. 3 %– 2. 5 %), and the amount produces 85. 5 %.

30|$|As {{crude oil}} supply {{all over the}} world is {{becoming}} heavier and inferior in quality and the demand for middle distillate is larger, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process is still the key process in oil refinery and is now in rapid development [6]. The retardation effects of nitrogen compounds and condensed aromatics in FCC process have to be figured out if shale oil is used to produce clean fuel. The retarding effects of basic nitrogen compounds may be explained by two mechanisms [7, 8, 9]. First, the basic nitrogen compounds reversibly absorb on the Brønsted or Lewis acid centers and then poison the acid centers, thus weaken other hydrocarbons cracking ability. Second, since their big size and aromatic nature, the basic nitrogen compounds may be the precursors of coke. Li et al. [10] found that the retarding effects of non-basic compounds and condensed aromatics in catalytic <b>cracking</b> of coker <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> are not as serious as those of basic nitrogen compounds.|$|R

The process combines mechanical modifications with changes in process variables and catalyst formulations. The main operating regime of this novel refining process is high reaction temperature, short contact time, high catalyst/oil ratio and a special down-flow reactor system.

40|$|The high-severity fluid {{catalytic}} cracking (HS-FCC) process is a novel FCC process that enhances light olefins yield under high severity reaction conditions. The process has been investigated by using a small-scale FCC pilot plant (0. 1 BPD) with a down-flow reactor. High severity reaction conditions are preferable for enhancing the production of light olefins by {{catalytic cracking}} of heavy oils. As another option for the light olefin production, adoption of ZSM- 5 additive in conventional FCC units is well known. This presentation describes the effect of ZSM- 5 additive on the catalytic <b>cracking</b> of vacuum <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> under high severity reaction conditions, particularly focusing on the synergistic effect with the base catalyst. Three kinds of FCC catalysts with different activity were used as base catalysts.

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{tendency}} towards the intensification of chemical processes, the importance of fast reactions is growing. Chemists have developed heterogeneous catalysts which allow industrially very important reactions such as catalytic <b>cracking</b> of <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> or the removal of NOx from stack gas to proceed very rapidly indeed. It {{is well known that}} transport phenomena do limit the obtainable rates, however. When designing or optimizing a reactor, the catalytic reaction engineer takes these transport limitations into account by writing down and solving the corresponding conservation equations of mass and energy, in which both transport and intrinsic chemical kinetics are accounted for in an appropriate way. The textbook approach consists in obtaining the latter separately, i. e. at conditions where the effects of transport phenomena can be neglected. There are more and more cases, however, where such a separation is not possible without loosing essential features of the catalyzed reaction. In his book ‘Kinetics of Chemical Processes’ M. Boudart spends a chapter on this category with as title: ‘Irreducible Transport Phenomena’. The present set of papers provides some examples of irreducible transport phenomena, linked to catalyst deactivation during catalytic cracking, reduction of NO and oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. Some contributions focus on dedicated experimental set-ups. One of the messages is that the involved transport phenomena should be amenable to a quantitative treatment without adjustable parameters, e. g. by the use of structured reactors and by maintaining laminar rather than turbulent flow. Others provide illustrations as to how important reaction variables, like the catalyst surface temperature, can be measured. In order to remind the reader of more ‘exotic’ consequences of irreducible transport phenomena, a contribution on the simulation of autonomous oscillations caused by relatively fast surface reactions has also been added...|$|R

The changing feeds for riser reactors are responsible for undesirable effects like accelerated catalyst deactivation, reduction of gasoline yields, and increment of gas and coke production, mainly due to the contamination effects of nickel and vanadium.;The unsteady state pulse technique has been applied with several commercial catalysts and feedstocks. Equilibrium catalyst was simulated by steaming in a fluidized bed, artificial impregnation with metal naphthenates under vacuum, and calcination. B. E. T. surface area experiments, Scanning Electron Microscopy, and Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy analysis confirmed the effectiveness of the artificial aging method.;Experimental runs were performed in a microcatalytic fixed bed. In between injections the bed was fluidized to avoid coke profiles and reactant channeling. In a typical run 10 injections of 5 microlitres were cracked at different temperatures and carrier gas flows, keeping the cumulative catalyst-oil contact time under 20 seconds, to closely mimic the conditions of commercial FCC riser reactors.;The poisoning effects of nickel and vanadium have been demonstrated on different catalysts through the changes obtained in overall conversions, and product selectivities.;Experimental results were analyzed with two kinetic models: (a) a three lump model, featuring <b>gas</b> <b>oil,</b> gasoline, and <b>gas</b> plus coke; (b) a five lump model, where <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> was split into paraffins, naphthenes, and aromatics. The kinetic constants evaluated clearly showed a decreasing trend with the increment of metal loading from 0 to 5000 ppm of nickel equivalent.;The activation energies calculated presented a consistent trend, decreasing from 18 to 5 Kcal/mol, with increasing metal concentration.;It was also found that the catalyst deactivation process could be represented by a power decay function, with an exponent of 0. 25, equivalent to a decay order of five.;It was concluded that the pulse technique is a quite adequate method for testing cracking catalyst, for the attainment of reliable data for design purposes, and for the evaluation of kinetic parameters as a function of nickel and vanadium concentration on the catalyst.

Subsequently, the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) is applied to simulate the evolution of the mixture composition during hydrotreating. The results show that an accurate representation of eleven different LCO <b>gas</b> <b>oils</b> was obtained by the application of the molecular reconstruction method. The hydrotreating simulations of three LCO <b>gas</b> <b>oils</b> at different operating conditions showed a good agreement with the experimental data obtained at laboratory scale. The current stochastic procedure has demonstrated to be a valid tool for the reconstruction of the composition of LCO <b>gas</b> <b>oils</b> and the simulation of the hydrotreating process...|$|R
