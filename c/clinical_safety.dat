25|$|In 2005, Merck {{retained}} John S. Martin Jr., {{a former}} US District Judge for the Southern District of New York {{and colleagues at}} Debevoise & Plimpton LLP to investigate Vioxx study results and communications conducted by Merck. Through the report, {{it was found that}} Merck's senior management acted in good faith, and that the confusion over the <b>clinical</b> <b>safety</b> of Vioxx was due to the sales team's overzealous behavior. The report that was filed gave a timeline of the events surrounding Vioxx and showed that Merck intended to operate honestly throughout the process. Any mistakes that were made regarding the mishandling of clinical trial results and withholding of information was the result of oversight, not malicious behavior. The Martin Report did conclude that the Merck's marketing team exaggerated the safety of Vioxx and replaced truthful information with sales tactics. The report was published in February 2006, and Merck was satisfied with the findings of the report and promised to consider the recommendations contained in the Martin Report.|$|E
