40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to design, fabricate, and test the {{feasibility}} of a composite structural member {{for use in a}} bicycle frame. The composite members consist of a <b>centrifugally</b> <b>cast</b> low-density <b>concrete</b> hollow tube jacketed with carbon fiber-reinforced plastic. The design optimized the concrete mixture proportions, fiber orientation, frame geometry, and other details required to produce a performance grade bicycle frame. Fabrication included individual structural concrete members, carbon fiber wrapping, and construction of the metal joints and frame. <b>Centrifugally</b> <b>casting</b> superplasticized <b>concrete</b> was the chosen method of fabrication for the concrete portion of the composite members. The application of carbon fiber-reinforced jacketing to concrete structural members has proven to be an effective strength enhancing technique. Bending moment testing was done on the individual composite members and compression testing was performed on concrete mixtures achieving failure strengths of 2280 in-lbs and 1378 psi, respectively. The frame connections were based loosely on industry practice of connecting carbon fiber tubes. The result was a frame that weighs about 6. 6 lbs and has structural characteristics that are desired in a race performance bike...|$|R

40|$|Production of {{spheroidal}} graphite cast iron is today quite mastered technology. There are many methods achieving the nodular graphite morphology. Each {{of these methods}} have specific characteristics and requirements to technical support, properties and the type of applied modifier.

40|$|<b>Centrifugally</b> <b>cast</b> {{heat-resistant}} HP {{stainless steels}} are particularly suitable for applications where service conditions comprise high temperatures and aggressive environments; thus, they are extensively used in reformer furnaces, in which hydrogen production takes place. The demand for better performance has motivated developments in these steels. The addition of Nb and Ti as microstructural modifiers has proved successful {{in providing a}} more stable microstructure. In this work yttrium was added to <b>centrifugally</b> <b>cast</b> NbTi-modified HP steels. It was observed that its presence increased the level of fragmentation of the chromium carbides, a positive aspect for creep resistance. The main cause of the fragmentation is the formation of yttrium carbides, which serve as heterogeneous nucleation sites for the other carbides. One of the tubes, with a lower titanium content, showed the best creep performance among those tubes studied owing {{to the presence of}} a smaller volume fraction of the deleterious G phase. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Studies {{conducted}} at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington, have focused on assessing the effectiveness and reliability of novel approaches to nondestructive examination (NDE) for inspecting coarse-grained, cast stainless steel reactor components. The primary objective of this work is to provide information to the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission on the effectiveness and reliability of advanced NDE methods as related to the inservice inspection of safety-related components in pressurized water reactors (PWRs). This report provides progress, recent developments, and results from an assessment of low frequency ultrasonic testing (UT) for detection of inside surface-breaking cracks in cast stainless steel reactor piping weldments as applied from the outside surface of the components. Vintage <b>centrifugally</b> <b>cast</b> stainless steel piping segments were examined to assess the capability of low-frequency UT to adequately penetrate challenging microstructures and determine acoustic propagation limitations or conditions that may interfere with reliable flaw detection. In addition, welded specimens containing mechanical and thermal fatigue cracks were examined. The specimens were fabricated using vintage <b>centrifugally</b> <b>cast</b> and statically cast stainless steel materials, which are typical of configurations installed in PWR primary coolant circuits. Ultrasonic studies on the vintage <b>centrifugally</b> <b>cast</b> stainless steel piping segments were conducted with a 400 -kHz synthetic aperture focusing technique and phased array technology applied at 500 kHz, 750 kHz, and 1. 0 MHz. Flaw detection and characterization on the welded specimens was performed with the phased array method operating at the frequencies stated above.

40|$|Heat {{resisting}} <b>centrifugally</b> <b>cast</b> {{tubes of}} HP micro alloy (25 / 35 Cr/Ni, 0. 4 C), are extensively used in steam reforming, {{which is currently}} the dominate technology for hydrogen generation. High pressure of the reacting gases inside the tubes generates high hoop stress in the tube wall and together with the temperature exposure of 900 - 1050 °C causes the tubes to creep along the circumferential direction. The alloy's ability to successfully withstand the severe operating condition is highly dependent on its high temperature creep-rupture behaviour. In recent years a number of manufactures have introduced higher creep-rupture strength versions of the heat resisting HP micro alloy. As a consequence {{they are able to}} offer the <b>centrifugally</b> <b>cast</b> tubes in thinner walls. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} enhance the creep-rupture strength of the alloy produced by Doncasters Paralloy. The immediate objective of this research project is to establish the mechanisms that govern the creep process in this alloy system. Once these mechanisms are better understood further alloy development within the present alloy composition can be achieved. The advanced stages of the project specifically involve studying the influence of microstructure in relation to creep resistance as a function of compositional modifications. ...|$|R
