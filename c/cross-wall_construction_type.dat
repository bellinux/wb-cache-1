40|$|This paper {{describes}} the syntax and semantics of reciprocity in the Central dialect of Rotokas, a non-Austronesian (Papuan) language spoken in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea. In Central Rotokas, {{there are three}} main reciprocal <b>construction</b> <b>types,</b> which differ formally according to where the reﬂexive/reciprocal marker (ora-) occurs in the clause: on the verb, on a pronominal argument or adjunct, or on a body part noun. The choice of <b>construction</b> <b>type</b> is determined by two considerations: the valency of the verb (i. e., whether it has one or two core arguments) and whether the reciprocal action is performed on a body part. The <b>construction</b> <b>types</b> are compatible {{with a wide range}} of the logical subtypes of reciprocity (strong, melee, chaining, etc.) ...|$|R
30|$|Figure  3 {{shows the}} annual {{building}} damage ratio, damage, and economic losses of the exceedance probability 0.1 – 10  % (return periods of 1 / 1000 a– 1 / 10 a, respectively). Figure  3 a, building damage ratio, reflects the comprehensive vulnerability of <b>construction</b> <b>types</b> to wind damage. At all return periods, Misc. building exhibits the highest damage ratio, brick-wood comes second, while reinforced concrete building {{is the least}} vulnerable. Figure  3 b takes both vulnerability and exposure into account. Composite masonry building, although its vulnerability is moderate among all <b>construction</b> <b>types,</b> shows the largest area damaged {{because this is the}} major <b>construction</b> <b>type</b> in Shenzhen. Annual damage to brick-wood building was smaller than composite masonry building due to its limited exposure, although it is much less wind-resistant than composite masonry building. Misc. building damage was too small even to be observed in the figure for the same reason. Figure  3 c, building economic losses, shows the economic losses measured with the replacement costs of each <b>construction</b> <b>type,</b> with a similar pattern to building damage due to the large difference in exposure.|$|R
40|$|Offsite {{construction}} {{has long been}} reported as an effective alternative to conventional construction, with wide-ranging benefits. However, a wider take-up has been inhibited by perceived cost barriers which are insufficiently studied. Such cost barriers are addressed, drawing on {{an examination of the}} cost performance of four <b>types</b> of <b>construction</b> method: pre-cast concrete cross-wall panel, in-situ reinforced concrete (RC) frame, steel frame and timber frame. Data were collected for 20 medium to high rise residential buildings of eight projects by a leading UK housebuilder over a five-year period (2004 - 08). In all cases, detailed cost comparisons were completed for build method selection. Cross-wall was found to be consistently cheaper than RC frame or steel frame by 11 % to 32 % in the projects. The process of developing and innovating cross-wall technology led to sustained cost savings up to 25 % from its first use. <b>Cross-wall</b> <b>construction</b> also improved cost effectiveness of 20 -storey high rise buildings over other solutions. Cost engineering means for achieving cost reduction and effectiveness are identified, which included efficiency learning, technological innovation, multinational partnering, and 'in-house' build management. The results prove the logic of the experience curve in improving the cost efficiency of offsite construction, and should encourage offsite construction in the future. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates tone sandhi {{phenomena}} in Pingyao, a Jin dialect spoken in Shanxi province in China. Pingyao tone sandhi is special in that tone sandhi in bi-syllabic strings is construction sensitive, but tone sandhi in tri-syllabic strings {{is not fully}} conditioned by <b>construction</b> <b>types.</b> Based on Optimality Theory (OT), this paper proposes analyses for bi-tonal and tri-tonal sandhi in Pingyao. We show that while bi-tonal sandhi can {{be accounted for by}} assuming that there are different grammars associated with different <b>construction</b> <b>types,</b> the lack of construction sensitivity in certain tri-syllabic strings suggests that the association between <b>construction</b> <b>types</b> and phonological grammars can be sacrificed to comply with a higher demand. In Pingyao, the higher demand is to avoid having a tri-tonal string with marked tone sandhi domain from being associated with conflicting grammars...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In an 18 -month {{study of}} malaria in a {{population}} of 1, 875 residents in 423 houses in an endemic area in southern Sri Lanka, the risk of malaria {{was found to be}} 2. 5 -fold higher in residents of poorly constructed houses than in those living in houses of good <b>construction</b> <b>type.</b> In residents of poorly constructed houses but not in others, the risk was even greater when the house was located near a source of water that could act as a potential breeding place for malaria vector mosquitoes (P 5 0. 0001). Based on previous findings that confirmed that house <b>construction</b> <b>type</b> was itself a risk determinant, and not merely a marker of other behavioral factors, we have estimated the potential impact of two feasible interventions {{to reduce the risk of}} malaria: 1) the imposition of a buffer zone of 200 meters around bodies of water from which houses of poor construction were excluded, which was estimated to lead to a 21 % reduction of the malaria incidence in the overall population and a 43 % reduction in the relocated community; and 2) the conversion of houses of poor <b>construction</b> <b>type</b> located in the buffer zone to those of a good <b>construction</b> <b>type,</b> which was estimated to lead to a 36 % reduction in the incidence rates in the whole population and a 76 % reduction in the residents of houses whose <b>construction</b> <b>type</b> was improved.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare {{relative}} risks for hospitalizing injuries among 7761 Danish workers engaged in the <b>construction</b> of different <b>types</b> of major tunnel and bridge traffic links during 1991 - 2000 in order to determine <b>construction</b> <b>types</b> with high injury risk. Standardized hospitalization ratios (SHR) for injuries were calculated by <b>type</b> of <b>construction</b> (low-level bridge, high-level bridge, bored tunnel and submerged tunnel). All employed males in the total population of Denmark were used as the standard population. Neither the SHR nor the distribution of injury types were independent of the <b>construction</b> <b>type</b> (p< 0. 05). The hospitalization ratio was highest for bored tunnel workers (SHR =  1. 91; 95 % CI: 1. 65 - 2. 21) and here toxic gases and smoke were a major problem, whereas head injuries were more frequent among workers engaged in other <b>types</b> of <b>construction.</b> The substantial variation in SHR values with <b>construction</b> <b>type</b> might be an argument for inclusion of workers safety in pre-project decision making.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the description of collocations in the Swedish Academy Dictionary (SAOB 1898 –). The 81 phrases that Svensén (2004 : 212) gives as examples of collocations of different grammatical <b>construction</b> <b>types</b> are investigated. The following grammatical <b>construction</b> <b>types</b> are represented in the material: verb + noun object, e. g. fatta beslut (come to a decision), noun subject + verb, e. g. dagen gryr (dawn breaks), adjective + noun, e. g. inbiten ungkarl (confirmed bachelor), verb + adverb, e. g. neka blankt (deny flatly) and adverb + adjective, e. g. starkt begränsad (strictly limited). The representativity of the 81 collocations is discussed as well as whether or not the phrases constitute strong collocations which require a description in the dictionary. In addition I investigate which <b>construction</b> <b>types</b> of collocations are most important, semantically and grammatically. The representativity of the articles in the SAOB is also discussed. When the collocation I am looking for is not found in the relevant article in the SAOB I try to establish whether the semantic content of that collocation is represented by other expressions. If, for example, the collocation hård kritk (harsh criticism) is not found in the article KRITIK (criticism), are there other adjectives in the article that express a ‘high degree’ of criticism? The investigation shows, among other things, that 65 of the 81 collocations are accounted for in the SAOB. It is, however, evident that different types of collocations are given different amounts of attention. Collocations of the <b>construction</b> <b>type</b> verb + object noun are accounted for to a large extent, while <b>construction</b> <b>types</b> where one of the constituents is an adverb are often overlooked. Possible reasons for this are also discussed in the study...|$|R

Further, the impact of systematically altering construction variables (such as the construction materials used and the ratio of window area to wall area) has been investigated. Results will be used to better understand trends for expected noise reduction for typical <b>construction</b> <b>types</b> around the United States. Additionally, comparisons have been made between the effect of older and more modern wall construction techniques on whole-house performance. M. S...|$|R

30|$|The {{results in}} terms of {{building}} losses as measured by replacement costs are somewhat surprising. When cost scenario A was assumed, assessed AALs (million Yuan) indicate that upgrading <b>construction</b> <b>types</b> creates even higher risk, while the loss rate (AAL/AE) confirms lower relative loss risk. The difference shows the two inherent forces that determine the final losses, the change in exposure and the change in vulnerability. Therefore, in this case, the impact of increased exposure induced by upgrading <b>construction</b> <b>type</b> outweighed the effect of reduced overall vulnerability. Consequently, both slight increases in the absolute value of AAL and modest decreases in the AAD ratio are observed. By contrast, retrofitting yields positive effects when cost scenario B was assumed.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the semantic and syntactic properties of English constructions containing a verb {{followed by two}} (or three) prepositions (including expressions like to walk out on, to talk someone out of, to go up to). First it is argued that, just like simple verb-preposition constructions (e. g. to come across, to switch off or to refer to), multi-preposition construction (MP-construction) come in various types. By applying {{a large number of}} semantic and syntactic criteria to authentic examples, it is shown that a distinction needs to be made between two major <b>construction</b> <b>types</b> - the composite-predicate construction and the appositional construction - whereby the latter <b>construction</b> <b>type</b> can be further divided into a resultative construction and a Verb + PP-construction. Subsequently, FDG representations are offered for each of these <b>construction</b> <b>types,</b> reflecting the differences between these types at the Representational Level. Finally, some important implications for the theory of FDG are considered concerning the categorization of lexical elements, in particular the viability of (a) the distinction between particles, locative adverbs and prepositions (where they all take the same form), (b) the distinction between grammatical and lexical prepositions, and (c) the distinction between prepositions and conjunctions (where they take the same form) ...|$|R
