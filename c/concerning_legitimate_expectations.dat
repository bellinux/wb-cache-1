2500|$|The Court of Appeal {{clarified}} {{the position}} of the doctrine of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> in the common law by examining its nature and the different strains of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations.</b> A claim for a public authority to act according to a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> arises when the authority promises a member of the public that he or she will be treated in a certain manner, but the authority is instead inclined to act in contravention of that promise or in breach of the <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> created.

25|$|The {{courts of}} the United Kingdom have {{recognized}} both procedural and substantive <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations.</b> A procedural <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> {{rests on the}} presumption that a public authority will follow a certain procedure in advance of a decision being taken, while a substantive <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> arises where an authority makes a lawful representation that an individual will receive or continue to receive some kind of substantive benefit. In determining a claim for an alleged breach of a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation,</b> a court will deliberate over three key considerations: (1) whether a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> has arisen; (2) {{whether it would be}} unlawful for the authority to frustrate such an expectation; and (3) if it is found that the authority has done so, what remedies are available to the aggrieved person.|$|R
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> in Singapore protects both procedural and substantive rights. In administrative law, a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> generally arises when {{there has been}} a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual. To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness. The {{doctrine of}} <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts. Thus, where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, the individual has a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken. Alternatively, an individual may also have a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> to a substantive right. The recognition of substantive <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority's policy. This suggests the adoption of a free-standing proportionality approach, which has been said not to apply in administrative law.|$|R
25|$|Since its inception, the {{doctrine}} of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> has been viewed as an offshoot of natural justice. The duty to act fairly is a core tenet of administrative law and a predominant feature {{in the application of}} the rules of natural justice. With each individual's entitlement to natural justice and fairness, <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> reinforces the duty of public bodies to act fairly. It is this protection of fairness that made way for the courts' acknowledgement of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations.</b> In their elaboration of {{the doctrine}}, courts of the United Kingdom adopted other key aspects of judicial review such as Wednesbury unreasonableness, fairness, and abuse of power to justify the existence and the protection of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations.</b>|$|R
2500|$|As for the {{protection}} of substantive <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations,</b> in Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v. Public Prosecutor (1997), a criminal case, the Court of Appeal relied on the concept of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> to support the overruling of an incorrect legal principle prospectively– with effect from the date of the judgment– rather than retrospectively which would be the usual effect of a judgment. It stated that [...] "certain <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> could, in certain circumstances, be deserving of protection, even though they did not acquire the force of a legal right", although it emphasized it was not considering whether the Prisons Department was prevented from carrying out its duties by a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation.</b> In UDL Marine (Singapore) Pte.

25|$|A {{procedural}} <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> {{is created}} when a representation {{is made by}} a public authority that it will follow a certain procedure before making a decision on the substantive merits of a particular case.

40|$|BibliographyThe {{doctrine}} of substantive <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> is only starting {{to find its}} way into South African law at present. The courts have suggested that a careful analysis of the development of the doctrine in English law is required before it can be accepted in South African law. While this is certainly important seeing that the {{doctrine of}} <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> was originally taken from English law into South African law, the comparative analysis should not be restricted to English law. In English law the substantive <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> doctrine is all but settled and while the development of the doctrine in that jurisdiction has preceded South African law for a considerable period of time, many uncertainties regarding the doctrine still remain in English law. In contrast, substantive protection of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> is well established in EU law. It will therefore be foolish not to pay close attention to EU law in this regard. Any comparative analysis clearly shows that EU law holds some very important lessons for the development of substantive <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> in South African law...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> plays a {{significant}} role in international investment law. Although {{it is only in the}} past roughly fifteen years that the concept has come to the spotlight, its importance and utilization is on the rise. Generally speaking, the concept of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations,</b> under certain conditions, allows a foreign investor to claim compensation in situations where the conduct of a host State creates a <b>legitimate</b> and reasonable <b>expectation</b> that the investor may rely on such conduct, and consequently the host State fails to fulfill those expectations, causing damages to the investor. However, the concept of protection of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> has stirred up debates as to the legitimacy of its use in investment law and raised concerns due to its imprecise boundaries and excessively extensive interpretation. Accordingly, it is the goal of this thesis to either confirm or refute two main propositions. The first proposition suggests that the principle of protection of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> is an established principle of investment law with traceable origins in both domestic law and general international law.

No substantive <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> arose in the applicant's favour, following the dictum of Lord Fraser of Tullybelton in the GCHQ case that <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation</b> arises [...] "either from an express promise given on behalf of a public authority or from the existence of a regular practice which the claimant can reasonably expect to continue".

25|$|When a court protects an applicant's {{substantive}} <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation,</b> it {{is effectively}} mandating {{the outcome of}} a public body's decision-making process. One criticism is that this undesirably fetters the body's discretion as it will {{no longer be able to}} formulate policy without constraints. Nevertheless, it has been acknowledged that protecting substantive <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> ensures good administration. Consistency and fairness are reinforced in decision-making processes where the administrative power to alter policy is not used to unduly frustrate <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations.</b> Furthermore, when a public body acts contrary to what it had induced an individual to expect, it may cause that individual severe hardship, especially if he or she relied on the representation and there is no satisfactory alternative to the substance of the promise.

40|$|The {{central issue}} in this book is the Europeanization of the {{principle}} of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> in the context of European administrative law and of the growth of a European ius commune. First, an overview is given of the European principle of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> and the equivalent principles in the Netherlands, France and Belgium. Second, the application of the European principles, its spill-over effects {{and its impact on the}} principles of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> in these national legal orders are examined. The principle of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> is one of the many European general principles of law that are applicable whenever a case falls within the scope of European law. The content of the European principle and the criteria for its successful application are described. The principle is applicable in different situations and these are described on the basis of case law (f. ex. transitional measures, revocation). The same procedure is followed regarding the principle of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> or equivalent in the Netherlands, France and Belgium. The European principle is stricter than the principles in the Member States because of the severe criterion of a prudent trader and the absolute prohibition of contra legem application. There is a clear influence of the European principle in the situation of the direct application of European law (cases that are fully Europeanized) where authorities and judges have to apply the European principle of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations.</b> A national principle that offers broader legal protection can only be applied in cases that are not fully Europeanized (indirect application), as long as it falls within the confines of the European conditions of effectiveness and equivalence (and whereby the European principle is the minimum-standard). The area where the relation and tension between the European and national principles is an important issue is the area of European subsidies and state aid. The Netherlands had to give up a part of the legal protection that it offered on the ground of the national principle of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> (possible contra legem application, less severe conditions compared with the European requirement of a prudent trader and more protection for expectations in the context of subsidies). In France, the possible recognition of a national principle of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> is within reach under the influence of the European principle of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations.</b> In Belgium, the influence of the European principle is negligible. In general, Belgian administrative law should pay more attention to Union law and the principle of European <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> in particular. In all three Member States national judges must apply the European principle more often in fully Europeanized cases. In the long term, a common principle of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> is possible. This ius commune process can be stimulated by means of a more in-depth study {{of the principle of}} <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> (or equivalent) and the Europeanization of this principle in all the EU Member States in a common frame of reference...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> and soft law. In what circumstances can an agency’s guidelines create law — or at least legally enforceable expectations? At first glance, the answer would appear obvious. The key reason for developing soft law is to provide guidance and transparency as to the process (and sometimes the substance) of administrative action. Soft law by its nature gives rise to expectations. Whether those expectations, in turn, give rise to legal effects is decidedly less clear. In fact, this question has vexed Canadian administrative law. Nowhere are questions of soft law and <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> more salient than {{in the context of}} tax administration. We canvass the relationship between <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> and soft law in the context of Canadian tax administration. The analysis proceeds in three parts. In the first part, we consider the important roles of soft law in a tax administration system premised on self-assessment. Within this analysis, we list and describe six sources of soft law in the tax administration context. In the second part, we explore the development of the doctrine of <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> in Canada, and the implications of the Supreme Court of Canada’s (SCC) most considered treatment of soft law and <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations</b> in Agraira v Canada. The third part of the chapter analyses when (and pursuant to which principles) soft law in the tax administration context (eg information circular, interpretation bulletin, or advance judgment) may give rise to a <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectation.</b> We conclude that Canadian administrative law has only begun to grapple with <b>legitimate</b> <b>expectations,</b> and that its development in the context of soft law represents an important catalyst for sorting out a more coherent and transparent framework for the review of administrative action...|$|R
