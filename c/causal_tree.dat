Paralleling the treatment of bi-valued variables in [Pearl 1986], we show that if a collection of coupled variables are governed by a joint normal distribution and a tree-structured representation exists, then both the topology and all internal relationships of the tree can be uncovered by observing pairwise dependencies among the observed variables (i. e., {{the leaves of the}} tree). Furthermore, the conditions for normally distributed variables are less restrictive than those governing bi-valued variables. The result extends the applications of <b>causal</b> <b>tree</b> models which were found useful in evidential reasoning tasks.

We study action refinement in two connected models for true concurrency. The first model is an adaptation of prime event structures, called δ-free event structures. In this model refinement amounts to an expansion of events into event structures. Refinement {{is compatible with the}} history-preserving equivalence on event structures. The second model, called <b>causal</b> <b>trees,</b> is an explicit representation for event structures factored by history-preserving bisimulation. <b>Causal</b> <b>trees</b> are equipped with derived refinement operations, defined in an inductive way.

40|$|AbstractA TCSP-like {{concurrent}} {{language is}} extended with an operator for action refinement which {{plays a role}} {{similar to that of}} procedure-call for sequential languages. The language is given a denotational semantics that fully expresses causality in terms of <b>Causal</b> <b>Trees.</b> These are Synchronization Trees where each arc has a richer labelling containing, besides an action name, also the set of backward pointers to those arcs "causing" the present action. An operational semantics reflecting causality is also defined in SOS style by a causal transition system, the unfoldings of which are <b>causal</b> <b>trees.</b> The denotational and operational semantics agree up to causal bisimulation, which is proved to be a congruence for ail the operators of the calculus; notably, for the refinement operator. Also, a complete set of axioms is provided that characterizes the congruence classes of causal bisimulation for finite agents. The main result of the paper is an operational semantics firmly based on a view of action refinement as purely semantic substitution. Therefore, its operational definition provides a "parallel copy rule," i. e., the concurrent analogous of the classic "copy rule" for sequential languages...|$|R

40|$|The Algebra of Connectors AC(P) is used {{to model}} {{structured}} interactions in the BIP component framework. Its terms are connectors, relations describing synchronization constraints between the ports of component-based systems. Connectors are structured combinations of two basic synchronization protocols between ports: rendezvous and broadcast. In a previous paper, we have studied interaction semantics for AC(P) which defines the meaning of connectors as sets of interactions. This semantics reduces broadcasts into {{the set of the}}ir possible interactions and thus blurs the distinction between rendezvous and broadcast. It leads to exponentially complex models that cannot be a basis for efficient implementation. Furthermore, the induced semantic equivalence is not a congruence. For a subset of AC(P), we propose a new causal semantics that does not reduce broadcast into a set of rendezvous and explicitly models the causal dependency relation between triggers and synchrons. The Algebra of <b>Causal</b> <b>Trees</b> CT (P) formalizes this subset. It is the set of the terms generated from interactions on the set of ports P, by using two operators: a causality operator and a parallel composition operator. Terms are sets of trees where the successor relation represents causal dependency between interactions: an interaction can participate in a global interaction only if its father participates too. We show that causal semantics is consistent with interaction semantics. Furthermore, it defines an isomorphism between CT (P) and the set of the terms of AC(P) involving triggers. Finally, we define for <b>causal</b> <b>trees</b> a boolean representation in terms of causal rules.

To this end, we first explore how an instance of deciding weak cause {{can be reduced to}} an equivalent instance in which irrelevant variables in the (potential) weak cause and the causal model are removed, which extends previous work by Hopkins. We then present a new characterization of weak cause for a certain class of causal models in which the causal graph over the endogenous variables has the form of a directed chain of causal subgraphs, called decomposable causal graph. Furthermore, we also identify two important subclasses in which the causal graph over the endogenous variables forms a directed tree and more generally a directed chain of layers, called <b>causal</b> <b>tree</b> and layered causal graph, respectively. By combining the removal of irrelevant variables with this new characterization of weak cause, we then obtain techniques for deciding and computing causes and explanations in the structural-model approach, which can be done in polynomial time under suitable restrictions.
