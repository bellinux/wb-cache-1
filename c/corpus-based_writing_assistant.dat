40|$|Genuine lexical <b>writing</b> <b>assistants</b> {{that attempt}} to detect lexical errors such as miscollocations are {{traditionally}} less common in Computer Assisted Language Learning than spell and grammar checkers. However, there is empirical evidence {{of the importance of}} capturing and correcting miscollocations in the writings of language learners, and therefore an increasing number of proposals deals with the detection of errors in collocations and the delivery of lists of correction suggestions. However, very few of these proposals take into account the varying ease with which learners can master different collocation and miscollocation types, or the fact that some collocation type errors might be more common than others, given that a <b>writing</b> <b>assistant</b> should be capable of handling at least the most common types of miscollocation. Furthermore, existing proposals explore collocation error-specific strategies, implicitly assuming that with one universal strategy all types of miscollocations can be detected and corrected. Our preliminary study, conducted on Spanish and French material, highlights one type of collocation in which learners err the most: support verb constructions (SVCs). To account for this, we explore a SVC-specific collocation error detection and correction strategy...|$|R

40|$|Many {{resources}} {{are available to}} assist students in writing an (academic) text. Unfortunately, most of these {{resources are}} static: principles of composition and style guides {{can be found in}} manuals or on websites, (online) dictionaries can be consulted word by word and, sometimes, a grammar book is used to check a specific item. Using these resources is a time-consuming activity which is not necessarily very successful, as language teachers often find when marking students’ assignments. A lot of time could be saved and efficiency could be increased if this information could be made available in a more user-friendly way. The online <b>writing</b> <b>assistant</b> developed at our Institute accepts any academic text as input. The application adds as much relevant information as possible and returns this enriched text to the student. The information added ranges from style characteristics (e. g. readability and sentence length) to grammatical (e. g. the misuse of demonstrative adjectives) and lexical (e. g. typical word combinations) suggestions. In contrast to e. g. a word processor’s grammar checker, our application does not really correct the text. It only suggests possible improvements and mainly prompts students to reflect on their text. We believe this kind of monitoring procedure will support students in improving their writing skills. Moreover, the application’s log files allow us to collect many examples of ill-formed sentences or poor vocabulary usage which can be used as input for courses. The presentation will demonstrate the <b>writing</b> <b>assistant</b> and discuss the challenges that need to be addressed. status: publishe...|$|R
