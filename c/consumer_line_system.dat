50|$|IBM grew {{concerned}} about the delays in development of OS/2 2.0. Initially, the companies agreed that IBM would take over maintenance of OS/2 1.0 and development of OS/2 2.0, while Microsoft would continue development of OS/2 3.0. In the end, Microsoft decided to recast NT OS/2 3.0 as Windows NT, leaving all future OS/2 development to IBM. From a business perspective, it was logical to concentrate on a <b>consumer</b> <b>line</b> of operating <b>systems</b> based on DOS and Windows, and to prepare a new high-end system {{in such a way}} as to keep good compatibility with existing Windows applications. While waiting for this new high-end system to develop, Microsoft would still receive licensing money from Xenix and OS/2 sales. Windows NT's OS/2 heritage can be seen in its initial support for the HPFS filesystem, text mode OS/2 1.x applications, and OS/2 LAN Manager network support. Some early NT materials even included OS/2 copyright notices embedded in the software.One example of NT OS/2 1.x support is in the WIN2K resource kit. Windows NT could also support OS/2 1.x Presentation Manager and AVIO applications with the addition of the Windows NT Add-On Subsystem for Presentation Manager.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes to}} analyze two flow <b>line</b> <b>systems</b> {{in which we}} include {{possibilistic}} data-the priority-discipline is possibilistic instead of probabilistic- and measure the performances of the systems with the effectiveness measure “waiting time in queue”. In a previous work we have analyzed and developed a queuing model with uncertain priority-discipline, using Zadeh’s extension principle. Because of it in this paper {{the analysis of the}} model takes the work realized by Prade as a starting point to incorporate an uncertain priority-discipline in a flow <b>line</b> <b>system</b> by means of a possibilistic distribution. To verify the validity of the proposed method, we calculate the possibility distribution of the priority-discipline and the possibility distribution of the performance measure “waiting time in queue”, in two flow <b>line</b> <b>systems</b> with different waiting lines: the determinist flow <b>line</b> <b>system</b> D / D/ 1 and the classic flow <b>line</b> <b>system</b> M / M / 1 / N with finite capacity. Since the performance measure is expressed by membership function rather than by crisp value, the fuzziness of input information is conserved completely, and more information is provided for capacity planning in flow <b>line</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
