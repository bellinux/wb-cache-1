5|$|While the Enterprise is {{en route}} to Pacifica on a {{scientific}} mission, Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) receives a highly <b>confidential</b> <b>message</b> from an old friend, Captain Walker Keel (Jonathan Farwell) of the USS Horatio. Keel refuses to discuss his concerns, even though the frequency he is using {{is supposed to be}} a secure channel, and insists on a face-to-face meeting. Once they arrive at Dytallix B for this secret meeting, the crew discover the Horatio and two other Federation ships already present. Picard beams alone to the surface and is met by Captain Keel and the other captains. Keel reports strange orders from Starfleet headquarters and what he implies are suspicious deaths of Starfleet officers, and expresses concern of a conspiracy. Picard refuses to accept this without proof, but Keel warns him to remain wary. When the captain returns to the Enterprise, he is challenged by Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis) about keeping his contact with Keel secret. Picard is skeptical about the conspiracy, but says that he trusts his old friend completely. The Enterprise resumes its previous journey. Picard has Commander Data (Brent Spiner) review all orders issued by Starfleet Command in the past six months. While the ship is still on its way to Pacifica, a disturbance is detected in nearby space. Upon investigating this, the Enterprise discovers a mass of debris that surely must be the shattered remains of the Horatio. Data completes his study and finds several strange orders from the senior levels of Starfleet. Picard informs his senior staff of the conspiracy theory, and orders the Enterprise to Earth.|$|E

Puyi {{was interviewed by}} Lord Lytton, and recalled thinking {{that at the time}} that he desperately wanted to ask Lytton for political asylum in Britain, but as General Itagaki was sitting right next to him at the meeting, he told Lytton that [...] "the masses of the people had begged me to come, that my stay here was absolutely voluntary and free". After the interview, Itagaki told Puyi: [...] "Your Excellency's manner was perfect; you spoke beautifully". The diplomat Wellington Koo, who was attached to the Lytton Commission as its Chinese assessor received a secret message saying that [...] "...a representative of the imperial household in Changchun wanted to see me and had a <b>confidential</b> <b>message</b> for me". The representative, posing as an antique dealer, who [...] "...told me he was sent by the Empress: She wanted me to help her escape from Changchun. He said she found life miserable there because she was surrounded in her house by Japanese maids. Every movement of hers was watched and reported". Koo said he was [...] "touched", but he could do nothing to help Wanrong escape, which her brother Rong Qi said was the [...] "final blow" [...] to her, leading her into a downward spiral. Right from the start, the Japanese occupation had sparked much resistance by guerrillas, whom the Kwantung Army called [...] "bandits". General Doihara was able for in exchange for a multi-million bribe to get one of the more prominent guerrilla leaders, the Hui Muslim general Ma Zhanshan to accept Japanese rule, and had Puyi appoint him Defense Minister. Much to the intense chagrin of Puyi and his Japanese masters, Ma's defection turned to be ruse, and only months after Puyi appointed him Defense Minister, Ma took his troops over the border to the Soviet Union to continue the struggle against the Japanese.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} a relay channel where a relay helps {{the transmission of}} messages from one sender to one receiver. The relay is considered {{not only as a}} sender that helps the message transmission but as a wire-tapper who can obtain some knowledge about the transmitted messages. In this paper we study the coding problem of the relay channel under the situation that some of transmitted <b>messages</b> are <b>confidential</b> to the relay. A security of such <b>confidential</b> <b>messages</b> is measured by the conditional entropy. The rate region is defined by the set of transmission rates for which messages are reliably transmitted and the security of <b>confidential</b> <b>messages</b> is larger than a prescribed level. In this paper we give two definition of the rate region. We first define the rate region in the case of deterministic encoder and call it the deterministic rate region. Next, we define the rate region in the case of stochastic encoder and call it the stochastic rate region. We derive explicit inner and outer bounds for the above two rate regions and present a class of relay channels where two bounds match. Furthermore, we show that stochastic encoder can enlarge the rate region. We also evaluate the deterministic rate region of the Gaussian relay channel with <b>confidential</b> <b>messages.</b> Index Terms — Relay channel, <b>confidential</b> <b>messages,</b> information securit...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{practical}} wireless transmission scheme is proposed to transmit <b>confidential</b> <b>messages</b> {{to the desired}} user securely and precisely by the joint use of multiple techniques including artificial noise (AN) projection, phase alignment (PA) /beamforming, and random subcarrier selection (RSCS) based on OFDM, and directional modulation (DM), namely RSCS-OFDM-DM. This RSCS-OFDM-DM scheme provides an extremely low-complexity structures for the transmitter and desired receiver and makes the secure and precise wireless transmission realizable in practice. For illegal eavesdroppers, the receive power of <b>confidential</b> <b>messages</b> is so weak that their receivers cannot intercept these <b>confidential</b> <b>messages</b> successfully once it is corrupted by AN. In such a scheme, the design of phase alignment/beamforming vector and AN projection matrix depend intimately on the desired direction angle and distance. It is particularly noted {{that the use of}} RSCS leads to a significant outcome that the receive power of <b>confidential</b> <b>messages</b> mainly concentrates on the small neighboring region around the desired receiver and only small fraction of its power leaks out to the remaining large broad regions. This concept is called secure precise transmission. The probability density function of real-time receive signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) is derived. Also, the average SINR and its tight upper bound are attained. The approximate closed-form expression for average secrecy rate is derived by analyzing the first-null positions of SINR and clarifying the wiretap region. Comment: 14 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

While there are no secrecy constraints on the public <b>messages,</b> <b>confidential</b> <b>messages</b> need to be transmitted in perfect secrecy. First, we obtain an inner bound for the capacity region of the discrete memoryless channel by using an achievable scheme that uses superposition coding and binning. Next, we obtain an outer bound for the capacity region of the degraded discrete memoryless channel. We show that this outer bound partially matches the inner bound. Consequently, we provide a partial characterization of the capacity region of the degraded discrete memoryless channel. Finally, we consider the degraded Gaussian multi-input multi-output (MIMO) wiretap channel with public and <b>confidential</b> <b>messages.</b> We show that, to evaluate both the inner and outer bounds for the Gaussian MIMO case, considering only jointly Gaussian auxiliary random variables and channel input is sufficient. Since the inner and outer bounds provided earlier for the degraded discrete memoryless channel partially match, these sufficiency results provide a partial characterization of the capacity region of the degraded Gaussian MIMO channel...|$|R
