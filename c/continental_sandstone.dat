50|$|The {{break-up}} of Pangea {{resulted in}} the break-up of the Paleozoic metamorphic basement rock. The basement rock formed half-grabens where eroded sediments from the break-up were then deposited. These sediments created the metasedimentary rocks of the La Quinta formation. Development of the passive margin occurred after rifting. Characterized by carbonate and shale, the stable passive margin allowed for large amounts of clastic sediment to deposit and stay undisturbed until burial. Some {{of the most important}} source rocks come from this stage, including the La Luna and Socuy formations. The timing of the Paleogene collision is clearly recorded in the stratigraphy of the Maracaibo basin. There is an abrupt change in sediment type of the late Cretaceous made evident by the thickly deposited, pelagic shale of the Colon formation. This represents the beginnings of the Caribbean arc collision with the South American plate. As the collision continued, this region shifted from the passive margin stage to the foreland basin stage. These Paleogene sediments are characterized by fluvial and deltaic facies and make up the Misoa formation, fluvial sandstones that act as hydrocarbon reservoirs. Mountain building begins in the late Paleogene, producing mostly <b>continental</b> <b>sandstone</b> facies.|$|E
40|$|A uranium deposit {{discovered}} in 1977 in western Alaska, {{by means of}} airborne radiomet-ric data, is the largest known in Alaska {{on the basis of}} industry reserve estimates. At about latitude 65 ø N, it is the most northerly known sandstone-type uranium deposit in the world. The deposit lies in Eocene <b>continental</b> <b>sandstone</b> near the eastern end of the Seward Penin-sula, in the southern end of a graben that extends northward into the Death Valley deposi-tional basin. The deposit is apparently of epigenetic and supergene origin. The uranium was derived from the Cretaceous granite of the Darby pluton that forms part of the western side of Death Valley. Uranium from primary mineralization is in the subsurface in a marginal facies of the Tertiary sedimentary basin where nearshore coarse clastic rocks are interbedded with coal and lacustrine clay. Primary mineralization occurred when uranium-bearing oxidizing ground water moved downdip from the pluton eastward through transmissive clastic beds or on the surface. Uranium was deposited where the coal or other carbonaceous material produced a reducing environment in arkosic host rocks. The supergene enrichment is related to a soil horizon at the present ground surface. The most common uranium mineral is meta-autunite, but cofflnite has been identified in the primary deposits. The host rocks for the primary deposits were partly covered by basalt flows that issued from nearby vents. Some of the basalt is highly altered, and some basalt float from the supergene zone has alteration rinds that are enriched in uranium. Extensive exploratory drilling took place from 1979 to 1981. The average grade of the potential ore is 0. 27 percent U 308 and the average thickness is 3 m.

40|$|Natural stone {{has been}} a popular and {{reliable}} building material throughout history appearing in many historic monuments and in more recent buildings. Research into the intrinsic properties of specific stones {{is important because it}} gives us a greater understanding of the factors that limit and act on them. This can help prevent serious problems from occurring in our buildings bringing both esthetic benefits and financial savings. To this end, the main objective of this research has been to study the influence of the fabric and the mineral composition of two types of sandstone on their durability. The first is a red <b>continental</b> <b>sandstone</b> from the Buntsandstein Age called “Molinaza Roja”, which is quarried in Montoro (Cordoba). The second is quarried in Ronda (Malaga) and is sold under the trade name of “Arenisca Ronda”. It is a light pink-whitish calcarenite deposited during the Late Tortonian to Late Messinian. We characterized their petrological and petrophysical properties by studying their rock fabrics, porous systems and mechanical properties. In order to obtain a complete vision of the behavior of their rock fabrics, we also carried out two decay tests, the salt crystallization and the freeze–thaw tests. We then measured the effects on the textures of the altered samples during and after the decay tests and we evaluated the changes in the porous system. By comparing the results between intact and altered samples, we found that Arenisca Ronda is less durable because it has a high quantity of expandable clays (smectites) and a high percentage of pores in the 0. 1 – 1 μm range, in which the pressure produced by salt crystallization is strongest. In Molinaza Roja the decay agents caused significant sanding due to loss of cohesion between the clasts, especially during the salt crystallization test. In both stones, the anisotropies (oriented textures) have an important role in their hydric and dynamic behavior and also affect their mechanical properties (especially in the compression resistance). No changes in color were detected. This study was financially supported by Research Group RNM 179 of the Junta de Andalucía and by Research Project MAT 2012 - 34473...|$|E
40|$|The Jurassic rock {{sequence}} in Lebanon {{is characterized by}} pervasive dolomitization (thickness > 1000 m). Two distinct dolostones are recognized within this rock succession: fine-to-medium crystalline seepage-reflux grey dolostone and coarse-crystalline hydrothermal beige dolostone. In this contribution, field, petrographic, and geochemical investigations on a dolostone 'tongue', occurring in Late Jurassic carbonates in central Lebanon, are discussed. The dolostone 'tongue' consists predominantly of the beige Late Jurassic hydrothermal dolostones. During and/or after the deposition of the overlying <b>continental</b> <b>sandstones</b> (Early Cretaceous), meteoric water percolated through the sand layers and into the underlying beige dolostones. This resulted first in dolomite intracrystalline dissolution, {{and then in the}} precipitation of oxides/hydroxides within the pore space. Finally, the precipitation of ferroan dolomite cement - from reduced fluids during a new stage of burial - took place.

Dissection of a sandstone tableland has given rise to numerous inselbergs and large mesas, rising from the sand-covered desert floor. The height of the hills varies from a few tens to 500 - 700 m in the Wadi Rum area, whereas their slope shapes are controlled by lithological properties of particular sandstone units. Rock walls of the sandstone inselbergs are subject to frequent rock falls and rock slides and host an impressive array of tafoni and honeycombs due to selective weathering, {{as well as a number}} of rock arches. Lithological differences within the sandstone sequence are crucial controls on the shape and evolution of rock slopes, exerting the influence via contrasting patterns of weathering and slope failures.

40|$|The 800 m thick Brumunddal {{sandstone}} {{is partly}} an eolian, partly a fluvial sandstone deposited in a fault-bounded basin {{in the northern}} part of the Oslo Rift in Permian time. The sandstone is the youngest rift-related deposit {{in the northern part}} of the Oslo Rift. Well rounded detrital zircons are common accessory mineral grains in the sandstone. U-Pb dating of detrital zircon from a sample of the Brumunddal sandstone by LAM-ICPMS gives a range of ages from (rare) late Archaean ages to Permian (283 ± 4 Ma). The age and initial εHf pattern of zircons in the sediment match the main rockforming events in Fennoscandia from Archaean to Phanerozoic time. This kind of diverse provenance was most likely obtained by repeated recycling of clastic sediments of Fennoscandian origin, with Silurian, <b>continental</b> <b>sandstones</b> as the most probable direct precursors. Trace element distributions show a conspicuous absence of patterns with the high level of U and Th enrichment typical of zircon from granitic rocks. This is consistent with a complex transport and redepositional history: High U-Th, metamict zircons were selectively removed by abrasion during repeatedtransport-deposition-erosion cycles.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Aluminum-phosphate–sulfate (APS) minerals, formed {{during early}} {{diagenesis}} {{in relation to}} acid meteoric waters, are the main host of Sr and S in the Early–Middle Triassic <b>continental</b> <b>sandstones</b> of the Iberian Ranges (east of the Iberian Peninsula). The sources of these elements {{and the effects of}} paleoenvironmetal changes on these sources and on the formation of APS minerals during Early–Middle Triassic times, were established on the basis of Sr and S isotopic analyses. The S and Sr data (d 34 S V-CDT = + 11 to + 14 % and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0. 7099 – 0. 7247, respectively) can be interpreted as resulting from mixing of different sources. Strontium was sourced from the dissolution of pre-existing minerals like K-feldspar and clay minerals inherited from the source areas, causing high radiogenic values. However, the isotopic signal must also be influenced by other sources, such as marine or volcanic aerosol that decreased the total 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. Marine and volcanic aerosols were also sources of sulfur, but the d 34 S was lowered by dissolution of pre-existing sulfides, mainly pyrite. Pyrite dissolution and volcanic aerosols would also trigger the acid conditions required for the precipitation of APS minerals.

The holotype specimen {{consists of the}} nearly complete, articulated skeleton of a small volant avialan. Apsaravis ukhaana is unambiguously differentiated from other avialans based on the pres-ence of several unique morphologies: a strong tubercle on the proximal humerus, a hypertro-phied trochanteric crest on the femur, and extremely well-projected posterior wings of a surface of the distal tibiotarsus that in Aves articulates with the tibial cartilage. Ten other homoplastic characters optimize as autapomorphies of Apsaravis ukhaana in the phylogenetic analysis. They are as follows: ossified mandibular symphysis; dentary strongly forked posteriorly; hooked acromion process on scapula; highly angled dorsal condyle of humerus; humeral con-dyles weakly defined; distal edge of humerus angling strongly ventrally; humerus flared dor-soventrally at its distal terminus; lateral condyle of tibiotarsus wider than medial one; neither condyle of tibiotarsus tapering toward the midline; and metatarsal II trochlea rounded rather than ginglymoid.

40|$|ABSTRACT. — The stratigraphic position, sedimentologic {{characteristics}} and {{origin of the}} copper deposits of Oligocene (—Mioce-ne?) age are investigated in an area between Delice and Yerköy, on the northern side of Delice river. Copper mineralization is observed mainly in three different stratigraphic positions in the region. The first type is the native copper ore, found in red and gray colored <b>continental</b> <b>sandstones</b> and conglomerate which overlie marine fossiliferous (Middle Eocene) limestones. The second type is the malachite ore, found in Oligocene (—Miocene?) units of the Toprakhk tepe formation which consists of red sandstones, conglomerate and mudstones. This ore is restricted into the fine-grained, gray-colored sandstone and is rich in carbonized plant remains. The third type is the primary native copper and malachite ore found at the upper parts of the Toprakhk tepe formation. While the native copper mineralization is strictly associated with fault zones and slickensided surfaces, the malachite mineraliza-tion occurs {{in the form of}} a cement, binding mostly the aetritic volcanic material. Malachite type mineralization represents point bar and flood plain environmental condition of sedimentation. The local occurrence of malachite ore together with plant remains in gray-colored sandstone of the red-bed series indicates that this type of ore was deposited primarily (probably as a sulfide or native copper or malachite) during the deposition of the host rock material under chemically reducing conditions. On the other hand, the native copper ore is supposedly an epigenetic type and related to the tenaonal and compressional forces. Cuprite and malachite found with native copper was formed secondarily under surface conditions...|$|R

40|$|In the Ambrosia Lake and Smith Lake {{districts of}} the Grants mineral belt, New Mexico, uranium orebodies occur in <b>continental</b> <b>sandstones</b> of the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation and {{comprise}} two main types of mineralization. Primary ore formed {{early in the}} history of the host rock and resulted in tabular, peneconcordant orebodies rich in organic material. Redistributed ore apparently was formed by oxidative destruction and reconcentration of primary ore at some time after Laramide deformation and resulted in roll-type orebodies lacking organic material. U-Pb isotope ages of four redistributed ores from the Ambrosia Lake district give concordant to nearly concordant ages of 3. 3 to 12. 5 m. y., supporting the concept that most redistributed ore formed in the late Tertiary or later. U-Pb isotope ages of primary ores from the Ambrosia Lake district show pronounced normal discordance, ev-idently due to coupled, continuous loss of Pb and radioactive daughters of 2 '•SU and also, in some cases, to uranium gain in the Tertiary during redistributed-ore formation. Most of the Ambrosia Lake primary ores that were not clearly affected by Tertiary uranium gain plot on the concordia diagram close to a continuous diffusion curve for coupled loss of Pb and 23 sU radioactive daughters. The concordia intercept of this curve suggests a minimum age of about 130 m. y. Data for ores from the Smith Lake district show less coherent systematics compared with ores from the Ambrosia Lake district but consistently give pre-Tertiary apparent ages and, at least for the Mariano Lake deposit, do not indicate the presence of major amounts of redistributed ore of Tertiary age...|$|R

In contrast, detailed outcrop study and facies‐component analysis show that Eocene non‐framework coral buildups also developed in turbid, oligophotic (poorly illuminated) and nutrient‐rich conditions. The study area {{is located in}} the South‐Central Pyrenean Zone (Jaca Basin). Here, middle to upper Eocene prodelta clay/marl succession passes, up‐section, into prograding delta‐front sandstones and, subsequently, into <b>continental</b> <b>sandstones</b> and conglomerates. Coral‐rich lithosomes occur in {{the upper part of the}} clay/marls succession and are completely encased in clay. Within coral buildups, facies consist of: 1) coral boundstone with different coral growth fabrics (platestone and domestone, and subordinate pillarstone and mixstone) and abundant red algae, in a mud‐dominated matrix; 2) well‐sorted fine‐grained or poorly‐sorted coarse‐grained skeletal packstones with abundant coral fragments, red algae, bryozoans, benthonic foraminifers and rare planktonic foraminifers, locally rich in larger benthic foraminifers and siliciclastic sand; 3) red‐algae‐rich coral rudstone with pack‐wackestone matrix; 4) bryozoan floatstone in a mud‐ dominated matrix. These carbonate lithofacies pass, laterally and vertically into 4) thinly laminated clay to marls with interbedded sandstone beds. Coral boundstone, and associated packstone and rudstone wedges, form single bioherms and discrete biostromes (1 ‐ 8 m thick) that stack into larger carbonate buildups, commonly 20 ‐ 30 ‐m thick, with some up to 50 ‐m thick. Facies associations, textures and photo‐dependent components indicate these buildups to have grown in the oligophotic‐ (lithofacies 1, 2 and 3) and aphotic (lithofacies 4) zones, and in low energy conditions below fair‐weather wave base, where they were only occasionally hit by storms. Dominance of corals and bryozoans (plankton catchers) over sponges and mollusks (plankton pumpers) indicates predominance of phyto‐ and zooplankton over picoplankton, which suggest mesotrophic conditions. Our results highlight the contrast with present‐day “classic” reef models, and suggests that by the late Eocene reef coral assemblages where able to thrive in low‐light, low‐energy, turbid and nutrient‐rich conditions.

40|$|The Zambian Copperbelt {{accounts}} for approximately 46 {{percent of the}} production and reserves of the Central African Copperbelt, the largest and highest grade sediment-hosted stratiform copper province known on Earth. Deposits in the Zambian Copperbelt are hosted by the Neoproterozoic Katangan Supergroup, a relatively thin (5 km) basinal succession of predominantly marginal marine and terrestrial metasedimentary rocks that lacks significant volumes of igneous rocks. The stratigraphic architecture of the Katangan Supergroup in the Zambian Copperbelt is {{comparable to that of}} Phanerozoic rift systems. The basal portion of the sequence (Lower Roan Group) contains <b>continental</b> <b>sandstones</b> and conglomerates deposited in a series of restricted subbasins controlled by extensional normal faults. These largely terrestrial sediments are abruptly overlain by a regionally extensive, variably organic rich marginal marine siltstone/shale (Copperbelt Orebody Member, or 'Ore Shale') that contains the majority of ore deposits. This horizon is overlain by laterally extensive marine carbonates and finer grained clastic rocks that evolved through time into a platformal sequence of mixed carbonate and clastic (Upper Roan Group) rocks with abundant evaporitic textures, including widespread breccias thought to record the former presence of salt, now dissolved. Rocks of the overlying Mwashia and Kundelungu Groups are dominantly shallow marine in origin. Three significant tectonic events affected the basin. Extension associated with early rifting {{led to the development of}} isolated fault-controlled basins and subsequent linkage of these basins along master faults at the time of Copperbelt Orebody Member deposition. A later period of extension occurred during late Mwashia to early Kundelungu time (765 - 735 Ma) and is associated with limited mafic magmatism. Basin inversion and later compressive deformation (595 - 490 Ma) culminated in upper greenschist-grade metamorphism (530 Ma) in the Zambian Copperbelt.

30|$|The LaSaXing Oilfield in Daqing, {{the largest}} <b>continental</b> {{multilayer}} <b>sandstone</b> reservoir in China, is {{a representative of}} unitization sandstone oilfields at ultra-high water cut in China, and it is {{main part of the}} Daqing Oilfield with 85  % of gross reserve. After 50  years’ water flooding development, the LaSaXing Oilfield has entered the ultra-high water cut stage with sharply increased water–oil ratio and significant variation of oil–water distribution, development dynamic, and development law, and it faces the challenge of sharply rising water cut, serious production decline, seriously inefficient and ineffective circulation, and difficulty of tapping reservoir potential (Wei et al. 2013; Zhu et al. 2015). In order to maintain long-term stable production in the LaSaXing Oilfield, it is necessary to evaluate the water flooding development effect at ultra-high water cut stage, which has great significance for analyzing potential of oilfield and formulating the applicable development and adjustment program. The scientific evaluation index system is a prerequisite for evaluation of development effect at the ultra-high water cut stage, and the primary work is to screen and establish the evaluation index system (Liu and Xiao 2010).|$|R
40|$|Aluminum-phosphate–sulfate (APS) minerals, formed {{during early}} {{diagenesis}} {{in relation to}} acid meteoric waters, are the main host of Sr and S in the Early–Middle Triassic <b>continental</b> <b>sandstones</b> of the Iberian Ranges (east of the Iberian Peninsula). The sources of these elements {{and the effects of}} paleoenvironmetal changes on these sources and on the formation of APS minerals during Early–Middle Triassic times, were established on the basis of Sr and S isotopic analyses. The S and Sr data (d 34 S V-CDT = + 11 to + 14 % and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0. 7099 – 0. 7247, respectively) can be interpreted as resulting from mixing of different sources. Strontium was sourced from the dissolution of pre-existing minerals like K-feldspar and clay minerals inherited from the source areas, causing high radiogenic values. However, the isotopic signal must also be influenced by other sources, such as marine or volcanic aerosol that decreased the total 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. Marine and volcanic aerosols were also sources of sulfur, but the d 34 S was lowered by dissolution of pre-existing sulfides, mainly pyrite. Pyrite dissolution and volcanic aerosols would also trigger the acid conditions required for the precipitation of APS minerals. APS minerals in the study area are found mainly in the Cañizar Formation (Olenekian?–Aegian), which has the lowest 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. The lower abundance of APS minerals in the Eslida Formation (Aegian–Pelsonian) may indicate change in the acidity of pore water towards more alkaline conditions, while the increased 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios imply decreased Sr input from volcanic activity and/or marine aerosol inputs during Anisian times. Therefore, the decrease in abundance of APS minerals from the Early to Middle Triassic and the variations in the sources of Sr and S are indicative of changes in paleoenvironmental conditions during the beginning of the Triassic Period. These changes from acid to more alkaline conditions are also coincident with the first appearance of carbonate paleosols, trace fossils, and plant fossils in {{the upper part of the}} Cañizar Formation (and more in the overlying Eslida Formation) and mark the beginning of biotic recovery in this area. The presence of APS minerals in other European basins of the Western Tethys (such as the German Basin, the Paris Basin and the southeastern France and Sardinia basins) could thus also indicate that unfavorable environmental conditions caused delay in biotic recovery in those areas. In general, the presence of APS minerals may be used as an indicator of arid, acidic conditions unfavorable to biotic colonization...|$|R
40|$|Groundwaters of the <b>Continental</b> Intercalaire <b>sandstone</b> {{formations}} at {{the eastern}} piedmont of Dahar (southern Tunisia), where they outcrop, were analysed to study the mineralization, the water origin and the current recharge process. Hydrochemical study shows that these waters present a spatial variability of chemical facies which {{is linked to the}} lithology of the host rock. The factors contributing to the mineralization are mainly the water-rock interaction in particular the dissolution of evaporitic minerals and the cation exchange reactions. Stable isotopes show an enrichment in delta O- 18 and delta H- 2 contents principally for piezometric levels closest to the surface, reflecting measures found in the current rainfall subject to a semi-arid to arid context. These results are coherent with those of C- 14 and H- 3 that allow the qualitative identification of a current recharge which could probably be supplied by the recent infiltration of waters in Wadis and by the direct infiltration of meteoric water through the local sandstone outcrops of the basin. This concerns in particular the well of Salem ben Salem Dabbabi, showing a content of 1. 03 TU, and its static level is controlled by the Tataouine Wadi, indicating therefore an evident sign of recent recharge...|$|R
40|$|The evident zoning of the Devonian {{limestone}} facies (e. g. Hladil 1992) in the Moravosilesian {{branch of}} the Lugosilesian oro-cline indicates a distinct polarization between both the paleonorth-ern stable foreland and the advanced accretionary wedge of ac-tive Variscan orogen since the Lower Devonian already. More-over, also Lower Devonian siliciclastic facies on the Brunovis-tulian foreland (<b>continental</b> Old Red-like <b>sandstones</b> and con-glomerates) differs {{from those in the}} Silesicum (littoral and sub-littoral mature marine sandstones, interfingering with mostly with graphitic shales and acid or intermediate volcanites).

50|$|The {{study of}} {{sedimentary}} provenance involves several geological disciplines, including mineralogy, geochemistry, geochronology, sedimentology, igneous and metamorphic petrology. The development of provenance methods are {{heavily dependent on}} the development of these mainstream geological disciplines. The earliest provenance studies were primarily based on paleocurrent analysis and petrographic analysis (composition and texture of sandstone and conglomerate). Since the 1970s, provenance studies shifted to interpret tectonic settings (i.e. magmatic arcs, collision orogens and <b>continental</b> blocks) using <b>sandstone</b> composition. Similarly, bulk rock geochemistry techniques are applied to interpret provenance linking geochemical signatures to source rocks and tectonic settings. Later, with the development of chemical and isotopic micro-analysis methods and geochronological techniques(e.g. ICP-MS, SHRIMP), provenance researches shifted to analyze single mineral grains. The following table has examples of where provenance study samples are collected.|$|R
