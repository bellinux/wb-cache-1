5000|$|Some people {{consider}} a <b>cumulative</b> <b>flow</b> diagram to {{be a more}} sophisticated version of a [...] "burn up chart", which is the opposite of a burn down chart. A burn down chart tracks work remaining over time while burn up charts like the CFD track the growth (or shrinkage) of work in certain states over time. With its focus on tracking changes in queue size per state, the CFD has a stronger focus on identifying and rooting out the causes of dramatic changes in throughput.|$|E
50|$|It {{can also}} be {{calculated}} using the formula: Payback Period = (p - n)÷p + ny = 1 + ny - n÷p (unit:years)Whereny= The number of years after the initial investment at which the last negative value of <b>cumulative</b> cash <b>flow</b> occurs.n= The value of <b>cumulative</b> cash <b>flow</b> at which the last negative value of <b>cumulative</b> cash <b>flow</b> occurs.p= The value of cash flow at which the first positive value of <b>cumulative</b> cash <b>flow</b> occurs.This formula can only be {{used to calculate the}} soonest payback period; that is, the first period after which the investment has paid for itself.

This formula ignores values that arise after the payback period has been reached.|$|R
40|$|This work adds {{realistic}} dependency {{structure to}} a previously developed analytical stochastic network loading model. The {{model is a}} stochastic formulation of the link-transmission model, which is an operational instance of Newell’s simplified theory of kinematic waves. Stochasticity is captured in the source terms, the flows, and, consequently, in the <b>cumulative</b> <b>flows.</b> The previous approach captured dependency between the upstream and downstream boundary conditions within a link (i. e., the respective <b>cumulative</b> <b>flows)</b> {{only in terms of}} time-dependent expectations without capturing higher-order dependency. The model proposed in this paper adds an approximation of full distributional stochastic dependency to the link model. The model is validated versus stochastic microsimulation in both stationary and transient regimes. The experiments reveal that the proposed model provides a very accurate approximation of the stochastic dependency between the link’s upstream and downstream boundary conditions. The model also yields detailed and accurate link state probability distributions...|$|R

5000|$|Lower {{pressure}} peristaltic pumps {{typically have}} dry casings and use rollers along with non-reinforced, extruded tubing. This class of pump {{is sometimes called}} a [...] "tube pump" [...] or [...] "tubing pump". These pumps employ rollers to squeeze the tube. Except for the 360° eccentric pump design as described below, these pumps have a minimum of 2 rollers 180° apart, and may {{have as many as}} 8, or even 12 rollers. Increasing the number of rollers increase the pressure pulse frequency of the pumped fluid at the outlet, thereby decreasing the amplitude of pulsing. The downside to increasing number of rollers it that it proportionately increases number of squeezes, or occlusions, on the tubing for a given <b>cumulative</b> <b>flow</b> through that tube, thereby reducing the tubing life.|$|E
50|$|The term New Public Management (NPM) {{expresses the}} idea that the <b>cumulative</b> <b>flow</b> of policy {{decisions}} over the past twenty years has amounted to a substantial shift in the governance and management of the “state sector” in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Scandinavia, and North America. A benign interpretation is that these decisions have been a defensible, if imperfect, response to policy problems. Those problems as well as their solutions were formulated within the policy-making process. The agenda-setting process has been heavily influenced by electoral commitments to improve macro- economic performance and to contain growth in the public sector, as well as by a growing perception of public bureaucracies as being inefficient. The alternative-generation process has been heavily influenced by ideas coming from economics and from various quarters within the field of management.|$|E

40|$|In the {{research}} area of dynamic traffic assignment, link travel times {{can be derived}} from link cumulative inflow and outflow curves which are generated by dynamic network loading. In this paper, the profiles of <b>cumulative</b> <b>flows</b> are piecewise linearized. Both the step function (SF) and linear interpolation (LI) are used to approximate <b>cumulative</b> <b>flows</b> over time. New formulations of the SF-type and LI-type link travel time models are developed. We prove that these two types of link travel time models ensure first-in-first-out (FIFO) and continuity of travel times with respect to flows, and have other desirable properties. Since the LI-type link travel time model does not satisfy the causality property, a modified LI-type (MLI-type) link travel time model is proposed in this paper. We prove that the MLI-type link travel time model ensures causality, strong FIFO and travel time continuity, and that the MLI-type link travel time function is strictly monotone under the condition that the travel time of each vehicle on a link is greater than the free flow travel time on that link. Numerical examples are set up to illustrate the properties and accuracy of the three models. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. postprin...|$|R

The computational method of solving partial differential eq-uations (PDEs) by decomposition in invariant structures, which continues the analytical methods of undetermined coefficients and separation of variables, is extended by using an experimental and theoretical computation in Maple™. For internal waves vanishing at infinity, the Dirichlet problem is formulated for kinematic and dynamics systems of the vorticity, continuity, Helmholtz, Lamb-Helmholtz, and Bernoulli equations in {{the upper and lower}} domains. Exact solutions for upper and lower <b>cumulative</b> <b>flows</b> are discovered by the experimental computing, proved by the theoretical computing, and verified by the system of Navier-Stokes PDEs.

The most common are the types {{specified}} by ASME (American Society Of Mechanical Engineers), utilizing baffles, or a proprietary inlet diffuser.

The <b>cumulative</b> <b>flow</b> rates of these devices, as well as overall grease retention capacity (in pounds or kilograms) are considered. Currently, ASME Standard (ASME A112.14.3) is being adopted by both of the National Model Plumbing Codes that cover most of the US. This standard requires that grease interceptors remove a minimum of 90% of incoming FOGS (fats, oils and greases). It also requires that grease interceptors are third-party tested and certified to 90 days compliance with the standard pumping. This third-party testing must be conducted by a recognized and approved third-party testing laboratory.|$|E

One must evaluate not only the total flow past each point but the component flows past each point for each destination.

30|$|We {{used the}} AT (least cost) search {{algorithm}} for watershed modelling (Ehlschlaeger 1989) {{to estimate the}} flow accumulation of Pulicat drainage basin. This method provided a rapid and accurate procedure to measure the flow accumulation using the precipitation accrued by the topography of the basin derived from Digital Elevation Model (DEM). We obtained a 30 -m resolution DEM and depression features (e.g. dams and reservoirs) for the region derived from CARTOSAT data (BHUVAN, ISRO CARTOSAT DEM, 2016) and used a computational resolution of 100  m by 100  m grids. Thus, we smoothed the data using bilinear resampling into 100  m resolution {{in order to determine}} the major stream flows. The precipitation layers were resampled similarly. We used the GRASS GIS environment to perform the flow accumulation analysis. Initially, the topographical parameters for the basin were derived from the DEM and depression layer. We then derived the stream flow for each day by adding daily precipitation over the basin configuration and calculated the accumulated runoff values by adding the <b>cumulative</b> <b>flow</b> into the lagoon at the major streams. Figure  2 shows examples of the analysis for two different scenarios. Next, we fed the <b>cumulative</b> <b>flow</b> accumulation values to the LOICZ model as the values of runoff from the event (Fig.  3). Another component of freshwater input into the lagoon was from the direct precipitation, which we computed as the product of the surface area of the lagoon and the daily average precipitation over the lagoon.|$|E

In group A the arterial revascularization was performed with both internal thoracic arteries using as a Y graft and in group B conventional revascularization using left internal thoracic artery (ITA) attached to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and venous grafts {{to the other branches}} of the left coronary artery was performed. The flow in all grafts was measured at six time points during the operation. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>flow</b> {{at the end of the}} operation in the group A (arterial Y graft) was 51. 8 ± 24. 5 ml/min and in group B (conventional technique) it was 96. 8 ± 41. 1 ml/min (p < 0. 05). The flow in left ITA to LAD was similar in both groups (27. 3 ± 15. 9 ml/min and 26. 3 ± 16. 1 ml/min in group A and B). The flow in right ITA (25. 2 ± 18. 4 ml/min) was significantly lower than in ve-nous grafts (72. 5 ± 45. 5 ml/min). The calculated flow reserve was 2. 2 in group A and 2. 1 in group B. We found that the <b>cumulative</b> <b>flow</b> in arterial Y graft was lower in comparison with conventional revascularization. This is due to the lower flow in the right ITA branch of the Y graft compared to venous grafts.
