Designed by architect John Graham and built in 1910, it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It originally housed John Agen's Alaska Butter and Cream Company, which moved from Pier 6 (now Pier 57). Immediately north of that is another Graham building, built in 1918 as a warehouse for the Pacific Net and Twine Company. That company merged with the Marine Supply Company to form the Pacific Marine Supply Company, which continued to use the warehouse in conjunction with its operations on the old Pier 1 at the foot of Yesler Way. More recently, the building has been associated with genetic engineering company Immunex.|$|E
25|$|In March 2005, {{following}} {{the completion of}} Millions (2004), director Danny Boyle was briefly attached to direct 3000 Degrees, a Warner Bros. project about the 1999 Worcester <b>Cold</b> <b>Storage</b> <b>Warehouse</b> fire in Massachusetts. But due to opposition from surviving victims and firefighters, the project did not enter production. At the same time, Boyle received a script from screenwriter Alex Garland, who had paired with Boyle for The Beach (2000) and 28 Days Later (2002). Producer Andrew Macdonald, working with Boyle and Garland, pitched the script to 20th Century Fox, who were reluctant to finance the film based on its similarities to the 2002 remake Solaris, which performed dismally for the studio. The project was instead financed by Fox's specialised film unit Fox Searchlight Pictures. Since the preliminary budget at US$40 million was too demanding for Fox Searchlight, Macdonald sought outside financing from British lottery funds, U.K. rebates, and outside investor Ingenious Film Partners. With financing in place, Boyle entered pre-production work for Sunshine, for which he planned to commence production by the following July. Since Boyle had previously worked with Fox Searchlight on 28 Days Later, the existing relationship permitted the director freedom in production, working in a small studio.|$|E

5000|$|In 1896, Lydekker {{documented}} the supposed <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> cat in his Handbook to the Carnivora, Part I, describing {{them as a}} [...] "peculiar breed of Cats, adapted to {{the conditions under which}} they must exist to find their prey." [...] He noted that they were short-tailed and chubby, with thick under-fur and remarkable ‘feelers’. Their cheek whiskers and eyebrow whiskers apparently grew to a length of five and six inches, rather than the normal three inches. He attributed this adaptation to the dim light in the <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> <b>warehouses</b> making the cats primarily dependent on their sense of touch. His account mentioned that taking such a cat into the open air, particularly during the hot season, caused it to die within a few hours because it could not endure a high temperature.
