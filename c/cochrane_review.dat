40|$|Objective: To {{assess how}} {{information}} about adverse events {{is included in}} systematic reviews. Study Design and Setting: We included all new <b>Cochrane</b> <b>reviews</b> published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSRs) and all new reviews (2003 - 2004) in the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DAREs) in Issue 1 2005 of The Cochrane Library. Results: More than half of Cochrane (44 / 78) and DARE (46 / 79) reviews assessed drug interventions. The rest assessed surgery (Cochrane [12]; DARE [10]), psychosocial, educational, or physiotherapy interventions (22; 23). Seventy-six percent (59 / 78) of <b>Cochrane</b> <b>reviews</b> mentioned adverse events as an outcome compared with 48 % (38 / 79) of DARE reviews. Most reviews mentioning adverse events were of drug interventions (Cochrane [41 / 59]; DARE reviews [29 / 38]). Considering reviews that mentioned adverse events, 95 % (56 / 59) of <b>Cochrane</b> <b>reviews</b> included only randomized trials and 73 % (43 / 59) included an analysis of adverse events. For 10 <b>Cochrane</b> <b>reviews,</b> adverse events had not been reported by the included trials. In contrast, 58 % (22 / 38) of DARE reviews mentioning adverse events included only randomized trials, the rest included both randomized and nonrandomized studies. Conclusions: Most <b>Cochrane</b> <b>reviews</b> of drug interventions considered adverse events.

However, trials to test agents that could halt these cellular mechanisms have met largely with failure. For example, interest existed in cooling the injured brain; however, a 2014 <b>Cochrane</b> <b>review</b> did not find enough evidence to see if it was useful or not. A 2016 review found that maintaining a normal or low normal temperature appeared useful in adults but not children.

5|$|Emotion-oriented {{interventions}} include reminiscence therapy, validation therapy, supportive psychotherapy, sensory integration, {{also called}} snoezelen, and simulated presence therapy. A <b>Cochrane</b> <b>review</b> has {{found no evidence}} that this is effective. Supportive psychotherapy has received little or no formal scientific study, but some clinicians find it useful in helping mildly impaired people adjust to their illness. Reminiscence therapy (RT) involves the discussion of past experiences individually or in group, many times with the aid of photographs, household items, music and sound recordings, or other familiar items from the past. Although there are few quality studies on the effectiveness of RT, it may be beneficial for cognition and mood. Simulated presence therapy (SPT) is based on attachment theories and involves playing a recording with voices of the closest relatives of the person with Alzheimer's disease. There is partial evidence indicating that SPT may reduce challenging behaviours.|$|E

25|$|A 2013 review {{found the}} data {{too weak to}} support use of Chinese herbal {{medicine}} (CHM) for benign prostatic hyperplasia. A 2013 review found the research on the benefit and safety of CHM for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss is of poor quality and cannot be relied upon to support their use. A 2013 <b>Cochrane</b> <b>review</b> found inconclusive evidence that CHM reduces the severity of eczema. The traditional medicine ginger, which has shown anti-inflammatory properties in laboratory experiments, {{has been used to}} treat rheumatism, headache and digestive and respiratory issues, though there is no firm evidence supporting these uses. A 2012 <b>Cochrane</b> <b>review</b> found no difference in decreased mortality when Chinese herbs were used alongside Western medicine versus Western medicine exclusively. A 2012 <b>Cochrane</b> <b>review</b> found insufficient evidence to support the use of TCM for people with adhesive small bowel obstruction. A 2011 review found low quality evidence that suggests CHM improves the symptoms of Sjogren's syndrome. A 2010 review found TCM seems to be effective for the treatment of fibromyalgia but the findings were of insufficient methodological rigor. A 2009 <b>Cochrane</b> <b>review</b> found insufficient evidence to recommend the use of TCM for the treatment of epilepsy. A 2008 <b>Cochrane</b> <b>review</b> found promising evidence for the use of Chinese herbal medicine in relieving painful menstruation, but the trials assessed were of such low methodological quality that no conclusion could be drawn about the remedies' suitability as a recommendable treatment option. Turmeric has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries to treat various conditions. This includes jaundice and hepatic disorders, rheumatism, anorexia, diabetic wounds, and menstrual complications. Most of its effects have been attributed to curcumin. Research that curcumin shows strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities have instigated mechanism of action studies on the possibility for cancer and inflammatory diseases prevention and treatment. It also exhibits immunomodulatory effects. A 2005 <b>Cochrane</b> <b>review</b> found insufficient evidence for the use of CHM in HIV-infected people and people with AIDS. A 2010 <b>Cochrane</b> <b>review</b> found insufficient evidence to support the use of Traditional Chinese Herbal Products (THCP) in the treatment of angina. A 2010 <b>Cochrane</b> <b>review</b> found no evidence supporting the use of TCHM for stopping bleeding from haemorrhoids. There was some weak evidence of pain relief.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cochrane</b> <b>reviews</b> are {{considered}} by many to be the “gold standard” or the final word in medical conversation on a topic. We explored the eleven most relevant <b>Cochrane</b> <b>reviews</b> on herbal medicine and identified that frequently herbal medicines in the included studies had not been sufficiently well characterised. If data on the effects of the plant parts are unavailable, effects of co-active ingredients need to be considered and the plausibility of the study medications for the specific indications discussed. Effect sizes calculated from exploratory studies would be best used to determine the sample sizes required for future confirmatory studies, rather than as definitive reports of intervention effects. Reviews should be comprehensive, including discussion of putative adverse events and possible drug interactions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Forest plots are {{graphical}} {{displays of}} findings of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Little {{is known about}} the style and content of these plots and whether published plots maximize the graphic's potential for information exchange. METHODS: We examine the number, style and content of forest plots presented in a previously studied cross-sectional sample of 300 systematic reviews. We studied all forest plots in non-Cochrane reviews and a sample of forest plots in <b>Cochrane</b> <b>reviews.</b> RESULTS: The database contained 129 <b>Cochrane</b> <b>reviews</b> and 171 non-Cochrane <b>reviews.</b> All the <b>Cochrane</b> <b>reviews</b> had forest plots (2197 in total), and a random sample of 500 of these plots were included. In total, 28 of the non-Cochrane reviews had forest plots (139 in total), all of which were included. Plots in <b>Cochrane</b> <b>reviews</b> were standardized but often contained little data (80 % had three or fewer studies; 10 % had no studies) and always presented studies in alphabetical order. Non-Cochrane plots depicted a larger number of studies (60 % had four or more studies) and 59 % ordered studies by a potentially meaningful characteristic, but important information was often missing. Of the 28 reviews that had a forest plots with at least 10 studies, 3 (11 %) had funnel plots. CONCLUSIONS: Forest plots in <b>Cochrane</b> <b>reviews</b> were highly standardized but some of the standards do not optimize information exchange, and many of the plots had too little data to be useful. Forest plots in non-Cochrane reviews often omitted key elements but had more data and were often more thoughtfully constructed...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Cochrane</b> <b>reviews</b> are {{regarded}} as being scientifically rigorous and are increasingly used {{by a variety of}} stakeholders. However, factors predicting the publication of <b>Cochrane</b> <b>reviews</b> have never been reported. This is important because if a higher proportion of Cochrane protocols with certain characteristics (e. g., funding) are being published, this may lead to inaccurate decisions. We examined the frequency of published and unpublished <b>Cochrane</b> <b>reviews</b> and protocol factors that predict the publication of <b>Cochrane</b> <b>reviews.</b> Methodology/Principal Findings: Retrospective cohort study of Cochrane protocols published in 2000 (Issues 2 to 4) and 2001 (Issue 1). The publication status of these reviews was followed up to Issue 1, 2008 in The Cochrane Library. Survival analysis of the time from protocol publication to the first review publication and protocol factors predicting the time to publication was conducted. There were 411 new Cochrane protocols in the cohort. After excluding 39; 71 / 372 (19. 1 %) were unpublished and 301 / 372 (80. 9 %) were published as full <b>Cochrane</b> <b>reviews</b> at the time of study analysis (January 2008). The median time to publication was 2. 4 years (range: 0. 15 to 8. 96). Multivariate analyses revealed that shorter time to publication was associated with the review subsequently being updated (hazard ratio, HR: 1. 80 [95 % confidence interval, CI: 1. 39 to 2. 33 years]) and longer time to publication was associated with the review having two published protocols, indicating changes to the review plan (HR: 0. 33 [95 % CI: 0. 12 to 0. 90 years]) ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives To {{investigate}} {{the degree to}} which <b>Cochrane</b> <b>reviews</b> of drug interventions published in 2010 reported conflicts of interest from included trials and, among reviews that reported this information, where it was located in the review documents. Design Cross sectional study. Data sources Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Selection criteria Systematic reviews of drug interventions published in 2010 in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, with review content classified as up to date in 2008 or later and with results from one or more randomised controlled trials. Results Of 151 included <b>Cochrane</b> <b>reviews,</b> 46 (30 %, 95 % confidence interval 24 % to 38 %) reported information on the funding sources of included trials, including 30 (20 %, 14 % to 27 %) that reported information on trial funding for all included trials and 16 (11 %, 7 % to 17 %) that reported for some, but not all, trials. Only 16 of the 151 <b>Cochrane</b> <b>reviews</b> (11 %, 7 % to 17 %) provided any information on trial author-industry financial ties or trial author-industry employment. Information on trial funding and trial author-industry ties was reported in one to seven locations within each review, with no consistent reporting location observed. Conclusions Most <b>Cochrane</b> <b>reviews</b> of drug trials published in 2010 did not provide information on trial funding sources or trial author-industry financial ties or employment.
