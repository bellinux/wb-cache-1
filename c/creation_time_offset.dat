30|$|Recall {{that the}} RIPS {{requires}} time synchronization {{between the two}} receivers. However, the internal clock of the USRP device used as the reference to synchronize two receivers can only yield coarse synchronization. As a result, the phase {{difference between the two}} receivers contains two unknown terms: the distance metric and the <b>time</b> <b>offset</b> between the receivers. Hence, we use the true distances, which are physically measured, to calculate the <b>time</b> <b>offset</b> {{at the beginning of a}} ranging session. Assuming the <b>time</b> <b>offset</b> between receivers is constant over a period of time, we use this estimated <b>time</b> <b>offset</b> to calibrate the signal prior to the Q-range estimation.|$|R

40|$|With the {{development}} of numerous satellite navigation systems, there has been growing interest in {{the development}} of system independent receivers. However, one of the problems encountered is in the different time systems employed by each of the satellite navigation systems. Consequently, it has become standard practice to solve for the time differences within the receiver’s navigation solution. However, there are several ways of solving for the time differences and some doubt exists about their equivalence. Nevertheless to enhance interoperability and to enable a position to be obtained with any four satellites, satellite navigation system providers are intending to measure and transmit the <b>time</b> <b>offsets</b> to other <b>time</b> systems. The broadcast <b>time</b> <b>offsets</b> though are imprecise and cannot be applied as error less corrections. Consequently, numerous methods of employing the broadcast <b>time</b> <b>offsets</b> have been developed that account for their imprecision. While {{it is clear that the}} measured <b>time</b> <b>offsets</b> should be employed when a position would otherwise not be obtained, there is doubt surrounding whether or not the broadcast <b>time</b> <b>offsets</b> should always be employed. Hence, this paper initially proves that a number of methods of solving for the time differences are mathematically equivalent. Likewise, it is also proven that a number of the methods of accounting for the time differences with the broadcast <b>time</b> <b>offsets</b> are mathematically equivalent. Finally, it is proven that preciser position and time estimates, and smaller DOPs, are obtained with the broadcast <b>time</b> <b>offset.</b> KEYWORDS: GNSS, Single Point Positioning, GGTO, Precision. 1...|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, Compass, QZSS and the IRNSS, there has been growing interest in {{the development}} of system independent receivers. However, one of the problems encountered in system independent receivers is in the different time systems employed by each of the satellite navigation systems. To overcome this problem it has become a standard practice to solve for the time differences within the receiver’s navigation solution via a combination of receiver clock corrections and/or <b>time</b> <b>offsets.</b> While this technique overcomes the problem of the different time systems, it is at the cost of a satellite from each additional time system. Despite this, the numerous studies that combine multiple satellite navigation systems this way have still found that there are significant benefits in improved accuracy, integrity, continuity and availability. To enhance interoperability though satellite navigation system providers are intending to measure and transmit the <b>time</b> <b>offsets</b> to other <b>time</b> systems. The subsequent use of these <b>time</b> <b>offsets</b> will provide a more accurate navigation solution than without them. However, the problem with using the <b>time</b> <b>offsets</b> is that they pose an additional integrity risk because they are also potential sources of faults. However, {{with the use of the}} <b>time</b> <b>offsets</b> for multiple constellation solution, a proper Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring method has not been developed. Thus, mathematical models to account for the time differences with and without the <b>time</b> <b>offsets</b> are presented in this paper. Furthermore, the model that incorporates the <b>time</b> <b>offset</b> allows the application of Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring to detect the presence of any faults within the <b>time</b> <b>offsets.</b> The reliability of the linear models is then compared using GPS and GLONASS geometry in terms of the Minimal Detectable Biases, Protection Levels and the correlation coefficients. The results of this analysis indicate that a more reliable solution can be obtained with the <b>time</b> <b>offsets</b> because they are additional measurements...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the current}} Advanced Receiver Integrity Monitoring (ARAIM) scheme, the <b>time</b> <b>offsets</b> between {{different}} Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) constellations are estimated {{along with a}} position solution and the GNSS receiver clock error. This scheme is so-called Time-offsets Estimated ARAIM, i. e., TOE ARAIM. In order to enhance the interoperability and compatibility between different constellations, the <b>time</b> <b>offsets</b> {{are expected to be}} broadcast to users in future multi-GNSS positioning and navigation applications. This paper describes two new ARAIM schemes {{to make use of the}} Broadcasted <b>Time</b> <b>Offsets</b> (BTOs) : <b>Time</b> <b>Offset</b> Observed ARAIM (TOO ARAIM) and <b>Time</b> <b>Offset</b> Synchronized ARAIM (TOE ARAIM). It has been shown that the VPL performances of these two new ARAIM schemes rely strongly on the accuracy of BTOs. By varying the error model of BTOs, the simulation results have also demonstrated that the proposed new TOO ARAIM scheme can outperform the existing TOE ARAIM scheme- even if the accuracy of BTOs for integrity is degraded to 4. 5 m and the probability of a BTO fault is relaxed to. In addition, the new <b>Time</b> <b>Offset</b> Synchronized ARAIM scheme (TOS ARAIM) can also perform better than the existing TOE ARAIM scheme if the accuracy of BTOs for integrity can reach 0. 75 m. As the TOO ARAIM also has a very relaxed requirement on BTOs and better performance, the TOO ARAIM is regarded as a better ARAIM scheme for multi-GNSS with BTOs available...|$|R
