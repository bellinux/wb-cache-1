5|$|Immediately {{after the}} last interment, the local rulers {{abandoned}} the shaft graves in favour {{of a new and}} more imposing form of tomb already developing in Messenia, south Peloponessus, the tholos. Around 1250 BC, when the fortifications of Mycenae were extended, the Grave Circle was included inside the new wall. A double ring peribolos wall was also built around the area. It appears that the site became a temenos (sacred precinct), while a <b>circular</b> <b>construction,</b> possibly an altar was found above one grave. The burial site had been replanned as a monument, an attempt by the 13th century BC Mycenean rulers to appropriate the possible heroic past of the older ruling dynasty. Under this context, the land surface was built up to make a level precinct for ceremonies, with the stelae over the graves being re-erected. A new entrance, the Lion Gate, was constructed near the site.|$|E
25|$|The {{method of}} {{construction}} of the torture chamber of the papal palace at Avignon, used during the Inquisition, {{has been described as}} ingenious. The construction of some of the torture chambers at Avignon was based on principles of Acoustics, specifically designed to muffle the screams and cries of the tortured. The walls of the torture chamber recessed and protruded in a complementary fashion to the walls on the opposite side so as to reflect the screams of the victims locally, ensuring that their shrieks would not be carried to the exterior. A chamber located above the main torture chamber had a dungeon with a hole near {{the middle of the floor}} through which, according to accounts, the tortured bodies of the prisoners were thrown into a cavity. The chamber where the victims were being burnt was of <b>circular</b> <b>construction</b> and resembled the furnace of a glass-house with a funnel-like chimney at the top.|$|E
50|$|Originally it {{was thought}} (e.g. by Ekkehard Aner, Johannes Brondstedt) {{that this type of}} dolmen {{originated}} in the west, due to its approximately <b>circular</b> <b>construction.</b> These views were refuted by comprehensive research by Ewald Schuldt in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, which emphasized the autochthonous origin of different types.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the emergence of}} elite within the Early Iron Age society in south western Poland taking under consideration evidence from recently discovered settlement called Milejowice site 19, partly fenced with palisade-like <b>circular</b> <b>constructions.</b> Another Silesian distinctive settlement Stary Śleszów and analogy from adjacent regions (Bohemian new discovered fortified courtyard – “Herrensitz” Opatovice nad Labem), {{as well as the}} just unearthed burial area in Silesia with richly furnished chamber graves (Domasław, Wrocław district) support the authors view of visible deep social transformations and emergence of aristocracy in south western Poland, especially in the Hallstatt C period. New archaeological finds allow seeing that the discussed elite absorb cultural influences from the east via mid-Danube and from the south through the Alpine passes and adapt the Mediterranean ideas to its own social needs. In the conclusion the authors suggest that discussed region of Poland in the light of recent discoveries can be recognized not only as highly influenced by the Hallstatt culture but as a province of it...|$|R

Both navetas are oriented to the south and are domestic units which abut the outer wall. Inside these navetas there are benches surrounding a hearth. There is a grinding stone base and a clay structure outside naveta 11 and facing its façade, and both elements are most likely related to food preparation (cereal grinding). Naveta 12 does not have this type of elements related to it, although it has two small stretches of wall that close its entrance.|$|E
50|$|The site {{consisted}} of an outer ring comprising fifty-five small split oak trunks forming a roughly circular enclosure around 7 by 6 m. Rather than {{being placed in}} individual holes, the timbers had been arranged around a <b>circular</b> <b>construction</b> trench. Their split sides faced inwards and their bark faced outwards (with one exception where the opposite is the case). One of the trunks on the south western side had a narrow Y fork in it, permitting access to the central area. Another post had been placed outside this entrance, which would have prevented anyone from seeing inside. The timbers were set in ground {{to a depth of}} 1 m from the contemporary surface although how far they originally extended upwards is not known. In the centre of the ring was a large inverted oak stump.|$|E

50|$|A rotary dial {{typically}} {{features a}} <b>circular</b> <b>construction.</b> The shaft that actuates the mechanical switching mechanism {{is driven by}} the finger wheel, a disk that has ten finger holes aligned close to the circumference. The finger wheel may be transparent or opaque permitting the viewing of the face plate, or number plate below, either in whole, or only showing the number assignment for each finger hole. The faceplate is printed with numbers, and sometimes letters, corresponding to each finger hole. The 1 is normally set at approximately 60 degrees clockwise from the uppermost point of the dial, or approximately at the 2 o'clock position, and then the numbers progress counterclockwise, with the 0 being at about 5 o'clock. A curved device called a finger stop sits above the dial at approximately the 4 o'clock position. The physical nature of the dialing mechanism on rotary phones allowed the use of physical locking mechanisms to prevent unauthorized use. The lock could be integral to the phone itself or a separate device inserted through the finger hole nearest the finger stop to prevent the dial from rotating.|$|E
50|$|Access to the battlements {{are made}} from a {{staircase}} on the northwestern wall, defended by three simple embrasures and through a doorway with broken bow (that also provides access to the Porta da Traição (Traitor's Gate). The northwestern battlements provide access to the keep tower, a rectangular structure, flanking the western angle. A Roman arched gate provides entry into the towers principal hall, with four arrowslits and a vaulted ceiling with rounded cross-beams, formed from the four corner posts. From two flights of stairs is the next floor, just before the rooftop, with tiled roof. The southwest battlements provide access to the tower alongside the town gate, with a staircase to the roof. The extreme part of the battlements provide access to the rooftop artillery point, a nine-sided position, which flanks the southern angle of the fortification. This emplacement provides two levels of gun fire, with 12 arrowslits, although the top group is covered by the posterior-constructed vaulted, semi-spherical ceiling. The southeastern battlements links to the northeast wall, interrupted by the masonry of the alcalde's residence. On the outside of this wall, a support structure, that presupposes a terrace for the residence is visible. To the extreme of the wall is <b>circular</b> <b>construction,</b> with semi-spherical cupola, protecting {{the entrance to a}} circular staircase providing access to the exterior.|$|E
50|$|On {{the foot}} of the Nichoria acropolis there was {{discovered}} a burial circle, comprising a collective burial of 7 people; it was in use until the LH IIIA period, when the adjacent large tholos tomb was built. The latter, although looted in antiquity, yielded important finds. It had been built at a prominent position on the NW end of the acropolis of Nichoria. Its diameter was 6.60 meters and its height probably exceeded 6.50 meters. It contained four pits. The prominent position of the people buried there is attested also by the lavish grave goods which accompanied them: pottery vessels, sealing gems made of semi-precious stones and little items made of gold, ivory and faience. In a hole between the pits 1 and 2 was discovered a pile of bronze items and vessels, among which a bent sword with an ivory handle. It has been used {{in the course of the}} prime time of Nichoria (1400-1200 B.C.). However, there are also traces of use in the late classical and Hellenistic periods, related to the ancestors' cult, a practive particularly familiar in Messenia, but known also in the rest of Greece. Around the acropolis of Nichoria extends a necropolis with various kinds of tombs dating from the 15th to the 8th century B.C. Although the excavations were not carried out in the entire region of Nichoria, trenches opened in the region of Karpophora revealed remains of the settlement, such as the main street and parts of buildings which were used clearly for habitation. The most important among them was probably the apsidal megaron of the Sub-mycenaean period, one of the largest dated in the so-called “Dark Ages” in the entire Greece: it was 13 m. long and 8 m. wide, and it was accompanied by a <b>circular</b> <b>construction</b> with paved floor. It has been suggested that it might have had a ritual-religious character. Two more megaron-type constructions were discovered, dated to the LHII and to the LHIIIA1 period respectively, i.e. in the peak time of Nichoria.|$|E
