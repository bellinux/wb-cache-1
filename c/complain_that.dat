Lee reported overhearing Jackson <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> {{one side of his}} body was hot, the other side cold. She believed that somebody had given him something that affected his central nervous system. She advised the aide {{to take him to the}} hospital.|$|E
5|$|The first season, which premiered on March 19, 2009, was {{the number}} one primetime cable {{telecast}} among females 12–24 years old {{and one of the}} top four among all viewers 12–34 years old. The second season began filming at the school in 2009, and first aired on January 16, 2010. The show was cut from one hour to 30minutes and focused on new transfer students instead of current SCPA students, leading some students and parents to <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> the admission process had been compromised. The school denied the claim.|$|E
5|$|Under US and UN pressure, Pakistan {{arrested a}} few members of Jamaat ud-Dawa and briefly put its founder under house arrest, but he was found to be free a few days later. A year after the attacks, Mumbai police {{continued}} to <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> Pakistani authorities were not co-operating by providing information for their investigation. Meanwhile, journalists in Pakistan said security agencies were preventing them from interviewing people from Kasab's village. Home Minister P. Chidambaram said the Pakistani authorities had not shared any information about American suspects Headley and Rana, but that the FBI had been more forthcoming.|$|E

5|$|Combs {{also won}} {{approval}} of a $10million bond issue to benefit the state parks, which had poor lodging and few amenities. Combs combined the bond issue with $10million in revenue bonds and effected major renovations at all 26 of the state's parks. Though his dreams of seeing privately owned tourist facilities spring up around the parks {{did not come to}} fruition, out-of-state tourism to Kentucky more than doubled during his administration, accounting for about sixty percent of state park visitors and fifty-three percent of the overnight visitations to the parks. Journalist John Ed Pearce recounts that Kentucky natives began to <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> they could not get reservations in the parks during peak seasons and called for limitations on the number of out-of-state visitors or a reservation system that favored Kentuckians, although nothing was done to address these complaints.|$|E
5|$|Menlove Avenue {{suffered}} {{extensive damage}} during the war, and Smith {{and his wife}} often had to throw a wet blanket on incendiary bombs that fell in their garden. Smith was called up for military service, but was discharged three years later, and subsequently worked in an aircraft factory in Speke {{until the end of}} the war. Smith later left the milk trade and started a small bookmaker's business, which led his wife to <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> Smith was a compulsive gambler, and had lost most of their money. During 1942–1943, Mimi's sister Julia lived with Lennon at The Dairy Cottage; 120a Allerton Road, Woolton, which was owned by the Smith family.|$|E
5|$|The Charlemagne-class ships did not {{function}} {{well in a}} head sea. Stormy weather in the Bay of Biscay in 1900 caused the captain of Gaulois to <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> the ship's forward gun turret and casemates were flooded out and that the ship generated enormous sheets of spray when water came over the bow. Like most French capital ships of the period, they had pronounced tumblehome. Gauloiss captain also said that his ship was a steady gunnery platform and manoeuvered well in tight spaces but he criticized the armour layout as not high enough to prevent munitions from penetrating above the main armour belt and detonating below the secondary armament positions.|$|E

50|$|Though he {{remained}} {{a supporter of}} TVA, Neal constantly criticized the agency throughout the 1930s. He <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> its wages were too low, accused it of favoritism toward large industries, and <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> it was too slow in buying out independent power companies. After TVA had bought out most independent power companies, Neal <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> {{the loss of the}} companies hurt Tennessee counties which had relied on their tax dollars. When TVA forced Neal to sell his Rhea Springs property during the Watts Bar project (when the entire community was inundated), Neal sued, and was eventually paid $55,000 for the land.|$|R

5|$|Feeling {{that her}} {{employment}} opportunities were being blocked, that same year, on 19 January 1959, Johnson asked {{to address the}} members of the Bahamian House of the Assembly, but was told she could only speak after the session adjourned, to which she agreed. In her speech, she pointed out that a petition had been submitted to the House in 1958 for suffrage, which Members had claimed showed only 13 petitioners and 529 signatories. She provided mimeographed copies showing the actual number was 2,829 people and included people from Abaco, Andros, Cat Island, Eleuthera, Exuma, Grand Bahama, Long Island, and New Providence. She went on to <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> women were being taxed without representation and reasoned that should the vote not be extended to them, they should no longer have to pay taxes. She insisted that women were working members of society and were ready, willing, and able to participate as full citizens. Though the Members of Parliament were impressed with the speech, they did nothing.|$|E
5|$|The choreography for {{the ballet}} was {{elaborated}} by the ballerina's father, Filippo Taglioni. The audience's prurient delight in this scandalous scene is well conveyed by the reviewer for the Revue des Deux-Mondes: A crowd of mute shades glides through the arches. All these women cast off their nuns' costume, they {{shake off the}} cold powder of the grave; suddenly they throw themselves into the delights of their past life; they dance like bacchantes, they play like lords, they drink like sappers. What {{a pleasure to see}} these light women... The set for the ballet was an innovative and striking design by Henri Duponchel and Pierre-Luc-Charles Ciceri. Duponchel had also introduced technical innovations for the staging, including 'English traps' for the sudden appearance and disappearance of the ghosts. (Meyerbeer was led to <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> the spectacle was too much and was pushing his music into the background). Taglioni danced the Abbess only six times in Paris; she was replaced by Louise Fitzjames, (who danced the role 232 times).|$|E

25|$|Work on {{infrastructure}} {{has been}} completed, mostly on Genova and Hamburgo Streets, but residents <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> {{the work is}} too slow, hurting their businesses.

This, and similar complaints made by other NFL teams, would prompt the NFL during the 2004 offseason to instruct all of the league's officials to strictly enforce these types of fouls.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} November {{and again}} in mid-December French told Wilson he was {{thinking}} of moving Murray to a corps command.

25|$|The {{airport and}} {{surrounding}} areas {{have seen their}} share of accidents. Residents have complained that pilots often deviate from the recommended departure from the airport, following the BNSF Railway tracks. Pilots, in turn, <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> Fullerton and the neighboring city of Buena Park have permitted too much dense residential development in the area, which had been almost entirely agricultural when the airport was first constructed.|$|E

25|$|What Zaid {{means in}} fact is that he sought out verses from {{scattered}} sources, to collate them against the recollections of the huffaz. In this way everyone participated in the collection process. No one possessing any portion of it was left out, and so no one had reason for expressing concern about the verses collected, nor could anyone <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> the text had been gathered from only a select few.|$|E
25|$|The ethos {{at the end}} of the 19th {{century and}} the {{increasing}} influence of the Olympic Games made amateurism an issue in many sports. It was especially relevant in cycle racing because riders had begun travelling internationally to compete in track, or velodrome, races. Riders from one country would <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> they were at a disadvantage to those from another, that they were riding against what they considered to be professionals.|$|E
25|$|Critics (Feisal Khan) <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> Maududi had no {{training}} as an economist and {{his description of}} interest-based finance resembles that of the dynamic between South Asian peasant and village moneylender rather than between modern conventional bank and borrower, and further that Maududi gives no explanation why direct equity finance would lead to any more investment in {{what is good for}} society but not commercially profitable than interest-based lending has.|$|E
