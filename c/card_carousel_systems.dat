50|$|One {{example of}} a popular INS for {{commercial}} aircraft was the Delco Carousel, which provided partial automation of navigation {{in the days before}} complete flight management systems became commonplace. The Carousel allowed pilots to enter 9 waypoints at a time, and then guided the aircraft from one waypoint to the next using an INS to determine aircraft position and velocity. Boeing Corporation subcontracted the Delco Electronics Div. of General Motors to design and build the first production <b>Carousel</b> <b>systems</b> for the early models (-100, -200, and -300) models of the 747 aircraft. The 747 utilized three <b>Carousel</b> <b>systems</b> operating in concert for reliability purposes. The <b>Carousel</b> <b>system</b> and derivatives thereof were subsequently adopted for use in many other commercial and military aircraft. The USAF C-141 was the first military aircraft to utilize the Carousel in a dual system configuration, followed by the C-5A which utilized the triple INS configuration, similar to the 747. The KC-135 fleet was fitted with a dual <b>Carousel</b> <b>system</b> that was aided by a Doppler radar. ARINC Characteristic 704 defines the IRS used in commercial air transport.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a <b>system</b> with two <b>carousels</b> operated by one picker. The items {{to be picked}} are randomly located on the carousels and the pick times follow a phasetype distribution. The picker alternates between the two carousels, picking one item at a time. Important performance characteristics are the waiting time of the picker and the throughput of the two carousels. The waiting time of the picker satisfies an equation very similar to Lindley’s equation for the waiting time in the P H/U/ 1 queue. Although the latter equation has no simple solution, {{it appears that the}} one for the waiting time of the picker can be solved explicitly. Furthermore, {{it is well known that}} the mean waiting time in the P H/U/ 1 queue depends on to the complete inter-arrival time distribution, but numerical results show that, for the <b>carousel</b> <b>system,</b> the mean waiting time and throughput are rather insensitive to the pick-time distribution...|$|R

This recursion arises in queuing systems with dependent interarrival and service times, and includes alternating service <b>systems</b> and <b>carousel</b> storage <b>systems</b> as special cases. We obtain precise tail asymptotics in three qualitatively different cases, and compare these with existing results for Lindley’s recursion and for alternating service systems. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{autopilot}} in {{a modern}} large aircraft typically reads its position and the aircraft's attitude from an inertial guidance system. Inertial guidance systems accumulate errors over time. They will incorporate error reduction systems such as the <b>carousel</b> <b>system</b> that rotates once a minute so that any errors are dissipated in different directions and have an overall nulling effect. Error in gyroscopes is known as drift. This is due to physical properties within the system, be it mechanical or laser guided, that corrupt positional data. The disagreements between the two are resolved with digital signal processing, most often a six-dimensional Kalman filter. The six dimensions are usually roll, pitch, yaw, altitude, latitude, and longitude. Aircraft may fly routes that have a required performance factor, therefore the amount of error or actual performance factor must be monitored in order to fly those particular routes. The longer the flight, the more error accumulates within the system. Radio aids such as DME, DME updates, and GPS {{may be used to}} correct the aircraft position.|$|R

30|$|We {{present a}} number of key contributions. Firstly, we propose an {{interleaved}} data carousel model that is combined with the latest RQ (since it offers improved coding efficiency compared to R 10) [12]. The interleaved model mitigates against bursts of errors in a source block and hence reduces the time required to acquire all the packets that form the source block. Secondly, we present an analytical model that allows the calculation of file download times for a fountain code-enhanced data carousel. Thirdly, a realistic multi-layered simulator has been developed combining novel outdoor ray tracing, a physical (PHY) layer Wi-Fi simulator and a RQ-enabled multicast data carousel simulator. Limitations in the client (which are not predicted in our theoretic simulations) are shown to result in significant packet loss, even in ideal channel conditions. By implementing our proposed multicast <b>carousel</b> <b>system</b> (server, Wi-Fi access point and client), we show using Android-enabled tablets that real-world packet loss is a strong function of modulation and coding scheme (MCS), Raptor code parameters and multicast server rate. We recommend a full set of design parameters based on a combination of our theoretic simulations and practical tablet-based measurements. Finally, we validate and evaluate the performance of the proposed system and via a measurement campaign conducted on the streets of Bristol, UK.|$|R

Agriculture is described as one of the most dangerous industry in Poland. Based on these circumstances the studies were conducted where the main objective was to investigate a workload during agricultural manual and mechanized tasks. The analysis was conducted on 15 farmers on their own farms during the morning and evening milking in the tethering and <b>carousel</b> <b>systems</b> while lifting and carrying a full bucket or a sack and while the tractor was moving. The analysis of muscle load was conducted with the surface EMG (Electromyography) system and Job Strain Index method. The highest values of muscle tension and force were observed in the forearm muscles during the attachment of teat cups to the udder. It was connected with lifting the equipment in an uncomfortable posture assumed by the milker. For the tractor driver the ergonomics of the seat and steering wheel was measured. It has been demonstrated that unfavourable working conditions increase the musculoskeletal overload. One of the methods of preventing them is to create appropriate working conditions for a specific person and gender.

40|$|My {{research}} interests are broadly in stochastic processes and stochastic operations research. The focus of my thesis {{has been on}} non-standard stochastic recursions, where the already developed theory usually cannot be directly applied. This work was initially motivated by applications in manufacturing, but has since {{proven to be a}} rich research area both with broad applications in healthcare logistics (elective surgeries) and with interesting theoretical results on the solution of a specific class of stochastic recursions. Since then, I have successfully worked on the modelling and analysis of several different applications, including healthcare logistics, <b>carousel</b> <b>systems</b> used in warehousing, and traffic control. I am strongly interested in working more in all of these areas. In addition, I am unquestionably motivated in expanding my work to several other areas, including applications such as web server scheduling and production lines, and techniques such as Markov decision theory, large deviations, and fluid and diffusion limits.

40|$|Autosprout is {{the mass}} {{manufacturing}} equipment envisioned to produce Sprout, a pencil with a seed. This pencil concept {{was developed by}} MIT students a successful round of funding and first production run through Kickstarter. The goals for Autosprout are to fully automate the manufacturing process, and to reduce the manufacturing costs from eighty cents per pencil to less than thirty, while also producing a completely assembled pencil every five seconds. The original assembly process was slow and required a lot of manpower. However, it laid a foundation to design the automated process described in this thesis. The new system will feature two <b>carousel</b> <b>systems.</b> The first <b>carousel</b> will load the cedar pencil, cut a shoulder using a specially designed router, and finally add a dab of glue around the shoulder. The second carousel will load a pill capsule body and fill it with soil and two to three seeds. At {{the end of each}} carousel process the pill capsule and pencil will come together and the capsule will be placed onto the shoulder and the glue will hold it in place. Before the capsule is loaded into the carousel, it must be sorted and properly aligned. Models for a vibratory feeder were first designed and tested, but, due to the inconsistent performance of the models, an industrial vibratory feeder was purchased and modified. The modification consists of a chute leading to a vacuum system that removes the capsule from the feeder, rotates, and finally loads the capsule into the carousel by switching a valve making the vacuum into a stream of high air pressure. A similar system will be used for removing seeds from a hopper and placing them in the capsule. by Eric A. Del Castillo. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been a trend towards {{combining}} multiple forms of additive manufacturing together for increased functionality, freedom and efficiency. In this work, two forms of multiple-material additive manufacturing technologies - inkjet and direct-ink writing - are combined in a hybrid system. Several advantages are realized due to the increased material library and geometric freedom as a result of new printing modalities. Initially, models of each process are reviewed and the processes are evaluated for compatibility. Then, the precision machine design of a passively-indexed, carousel-style, syringe tool holder is completed. An error budget employing Homogeneous Transformation Matrices was maintained to estimate the tooltip errors. In order to register these two non-contact printing processes, a unique approach to their registration to a common global origin was necessary. A single non-contact optical CCD micrometer is used to register the three spatial coordinates of the syringe tooltip. Measurements are performed to characterize the repeatability of the nozzle registration scheme and the constructed gantry and <b>carousel</b> <b>system,</b> which well exceeds the requirements and the predictions from the conservative error budget. This novel system can print with a wide array of inks, including those that solidify via polymerization or crosslinking, two part chemistries, solvent evaporation or sintering, as well as liquids, gels and pastes. These materials can have a wide range of mechanical properties and functionalities, for example electrical conductivity or force sensitive resistivity. Models for the extrudate flow rate are used alongside experimental determination of the extrudate cross-section to ensure accurate process congruence. Finally, printed results demonstrate the various printing techniques, highlight the expanded material library, and display novel assemblies not possible with conventional additive processes. One such example is a fully printed pressure sensor array. by Nicholas Graham Bandiera. Thesis: S. M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, 2017.

40|$|This paper reports new {{observations}} of pulsars B 0943 + 10 and B 1822 [...] 09 {{carried out with}} the Arecibo Observatory (AO) and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), respectively. Both stars exhibit two stable emission modes. We report the discovery in B 0943 + 10 of a highly linearly polarized precursor component that occurs primarily in only one mode. This emission feature closely resembles B 1822 - 09 's precursor which also occurs brightly in only one mode. B 0943 + 10 's other mode {{is well known for}} its highly regular drifting subpulses that are apparently produced by a rotating <b>carousel</b> <b>system</b> of 20 beamlets. Similary, B 1822 - 09 exhibits subpulse-modulation behavior only in the mode where its precursor is absent. We survey our 18 hours of B 0943 + 10 observations and find that the sideband-modulation features, from which the carousel-rotation time can be directly determined, occur rarely [...] less than 5 % of the time [...] but always indicating 20 beamlets. We present an analysis of B 1822 - 09 's modal modulation characteristics at 325 -MHz and compare them in detail with B 0943 + 10. The pulsar never seems to null, and we find a 43 -rotation-period feature in the star's Q mode that modulates the interpulse as well as the conal features in the main pulse. We conclude that B 1822 - 09 must have a nearly orthogonal geometry and that its carousel circulation time is long compared to the modal sub-sequences available in our observations, and the mainpulse/interpulse separation is almost exactly 180 degrees. We conclude the precursors for both stars are incompatible with core-cone emission. We assess the interesting suggestion by Dyks et al. that downward-going radiation produces B 1822 - 09 's precursor emission.
