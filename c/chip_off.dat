He also scored in the following match against Guangzhou Pharmaceutical with a <b>chip</b> <b>off</b> the right post {{from the left side}} of the penalty area in a 3–0 win. On 5 August 2007, Nani made his competitive debut for United, coming on as a substitute in the Community Shield against Chelsea. He marked his debut with a trophy after they won 3–0 on penalties, following a 1–1 draw during normal time. This was followed up by Nani's third goal for the club three days later, when he scored against Glentoran in another 3–0 pre-season win.|$|E
25|$|Was it a mistake? No, said Lise Meitner; Hahn was {{too good}} a chemist for that. But how could barium be formed from uranium? No larger {{fragments}} than protons or helium nuclei (alpha particles) had ever been chipped away from nuclei, and to <b>chip</b> <b>off</b> a large number not nearly enough energy was available. Nor {{was it possible that}} the uranium nucleus could have been cleaved right across. A nucleus was not like a brittle solid that can be cleaved or broken; George Gamow had suggested early on, and Bohr had given good arguments that a nucleus was much more like a liquid drop. Perhaps a drop could divide itself into two smaller drops in a more gradual manner, by first becoming elongated, then constricted, and finally being torn rather than broken in two? We knew that there were strong forces that would resist such a process, just as the surface tension of an ordinary liquid drop tends to resist its division into two smaller ones. But nuclei differed from ordinary drops in one important way: they were electrically charged, and that was known to counteract the surface tension.|$|E

500|$|The basic {{technique}} for GMAW is quite simple, since the electrode is fed automatically through the torch (head of tip). By contrast, in gas tungsten arc welding, the welder must handle a welding torch {{in one hand}} and a separate filler wire in the other, and in shielded metal arc welding, the operator must frequently <b>chip</b> <b>off</b> slag and change welding electrodes. GMAW requires only that the operator guide the welding gun with proper position and orientation along the area being welded. [...] Keeping a consistent contact tip-to-work distance (the stick out distance) is important, because a long stickout distance can cause the electrode to overheat and also wastes shielding gas. Stickout distance varies for different GMAW weld processes and applications. The orientation of the gun is also importantit should be held so as to bisect the angle between the workpieces; that is, at 45 degrees for a fillet weld and 90 degrees for welding a flat surface. The travel angle, or lead angle, is the angle of the torch with respect to the direction of travel, and it should generally remain approximately vertical. However, the desirable angle changes somewhat depending on the type of shielding gas usedwith pure inert gases, the bottom of the torch is often slightly in front of the upper section, while the opposite is true when the welding atmosphere is carbon dioxide.|$|E

500|$|In 1996, American author Raymond Benson {{became the}} writer of the Bond novels. Benson had {{previously}} written The James Bond Bedside Companion, first published in 1984, and had also written scenarios and support material for the early 1980s 007 James Bond dice-and-paper role playing game. By the time {{he moved on to}} other, non-Bond related projects in 2002, Benson had written six Bond novels, three novelizations and three short stories. Benson followed Gardner's pattern of setting Bond in the contemporary timeframe of the 1990s and, according to academic Jeremy Black, had more echoes of Fleming's style than John Gardner. Benson also changed Bond's gun back to the Walther PPK, put him {{behind the wheel of a}} Jaguar XK8 and made him swear more, which led Black to note that there was an increased level of crudity lacking in either Fleming or Gardner. However, commenting in The Australian, Peter Janson-Smith, Fleming's former literary agent, noted that Benson [...] "has got the Fleming feel... It's as close to Fleming as I have seen." [...] The Peterborough Evening Telegraph agreed, stating that with Benson's 007, in keeping more with Fleming, [...] "PC-ness goes out the window and it's a more ruthless Bond with bad habits." [...] The Sunday Mercury in 1999 said, [...] "Benson has made Bond less gimmicky, concentrating on the action rather than the gadgets. The result is a slick enough read for dedicated Bond fans who like blazing guns (Walthers, of course) and beautiful women" [...] and Kirkus Reviews called Benson's 007 [...] "a <b>chip</b> <b>off</b> the old block and, if not a gilt-edged Bond, at least a double-A." ...|$|E
500|$|Jillian Bowe of Zap2it was {{surprised}} by the decision to age both Fenmore and Summer Newman (Hunter King) at the same time. Omar White-Nobles of TVSource wrote, [...] "Don't they grow up fast?", referring to soap opera rapid aging syndrome. Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps wrote that aging the characters would help to [...] "beef up" [...] the soap opera's summer storylines. Roger Newcomb of the website We Love Soaps wondered if the character would [...] "have issues with his parents the way other aged kids on the show have of late". [...] Fairman later stated of Ehrich's portrayal: [...] "Recently, the powers-that-be at Y chose to age Lauren and Michael’s tot of a son, Fenmore, to a teenager (another victim of Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome) and with that comes new complex problems for the Baldwins, and as it appears “Fen” may be a <b>chip</b> <b>off</b> the old block ... sort to speak. [...] The talented Max Ehrich was cast as the new Fen, and since he has begun to air in the part he has received high marks, not only from his scene partners, but daytime fans, too."

Luke Kerr, also of Zap2it, wrote that he [...] "really likes" [...] Ehrich as Fenmore, stating: [...] "He has totally mastered the Baldwin/Fisher crazy behind-the-eyes element of early Michael and Kevin (Greg Rikaart)." [...] Jamey Giddens also wrote of the character's family storyline, saying: [...] "A father hellbent on preventing his son from going down the same unspeakable path he once traveled; a mother who refuses to believe her child could be guilty of the heinous crime he's being accused of committing.
