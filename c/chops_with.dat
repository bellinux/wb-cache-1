500|$|... "Tunnel Vision" [...] is a mid-tempo R {{song with}} an EDM influence. Billboards Jason Lipshutz {{noted that it}} has an {{instrumentation}} that features [...] "fizzing beats abetted by the producer's [...] signature ad-libs and vocal record-scratches", while according to Sobhi Youssef of Sputnikmusic the song is built on [...] "still-existing <b>chops</b> <b>with</b> a drum heavy, syncopated backbone amidst frenetically shifting bass melodies, sweeping orchestrations, and vacuous synths that all coalesce into a fuzzed out boom-bap." [...] Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media called the synthesizer [...] "sinister" [...] and, according to Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson, it has Middle Eastern tones. Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle called the beats and vocal loops on [...] "Tunnel Vision" [...] reminiscent of Timbaland's past work with the late American singer Aaliyah. According to Sarah Dean of The Huffington Post, its beat resembles that on 50 Cent's 2007 single [...] "Ayo Technology" [...] (also featuring Timberlake).|$|E

60|$|His {{movements}} were slow. He shook {{as with a}} palsy. When he started to collect dry moss, he found he could not rise to his feet. He tried again and again, then contented himself with crawling about on hands and knees. Once he crawled near to the sick wolf. The animal dragged itself reluctantly out of his way, licking its <b>chops</b> <b>with</b> a tongue which seemed hardly to {{have the strength to}} curl. The man noticed that the tongue was not the customary healthy red. It was a yellowish brown and seemed coated with a rough and half-dry mucus.|$|E

60|$|The {{work which}} the {{engineers}} had accomplished was {{little less than}} marvelous. Eighty miles of road had been cut and cleared, every stream, however insignificant, had been bridged, and attempts made to corduroy every swamp. This {{would have been no}} great feat through a soft wood forest with the aid of good workmen. Here, however, the trees were for the most part of extremely hard wood, teak and mahogany forming the majority. The natives had no idea of using an axe. Their only notion of felling a tree was to squat down beside it and give it little hacking <b>chops</b> <b>with</b> a large knife or a sabre.|$|E

40|$|AIM:To {{research}} clinical {{effect of}} two manual chopping methods for small incision extracapsular cataract extraction. METHODS: We observed 143 cases(184 eyes) with grade Ⅳ or higher taken the small incision cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation. Patients were given randomly knifed <b>chopping</b> <b>with</b> closed hook(92 eyes) or double knifed chopping(92 eyes). The intra-operative posterior capsule rupture was observed and compared. At 1 d, 1 wk and 1 mo postoperatively, visual acuity, corneal edema and corneal astigmatism were observed and analyzed. RESULTS:There were 10 eyes in patients accepting knifed <b>chopping</b> <b>with</b> closed hook with intra-operative posterior capsule rupture and 1 eye in patients accepting double knifed chopping. The {{difference between the}} two groups was statistically significant. The visual acuity of patients accepting knifed <b>chopping</b> <b>with</b> closed hook(92 eyes) at 1 d postoperatively was 0. 380 ± 0. 105, and that of patients accepting double knifed chopping(92 eyes) was 0. 420 ± 0. 095; the {{difference between the two}} groups was statistically significant. The visual acuity of patients accepting knifed <b>chopping</b> <b>with</b> closed hook(84 eyes) at 1 wk postoperatively was 0. 480 ± 0. 123, and that of patients accepting double knifed chopping(86 eyes) was 0. 520 ± 0. 085; the {{difference between the two groups}} was statistically significant. The visual acuity of patients accepting knifed <b>chopping</b> <b>with</b> closed hook(60 eyes) at 1 mo postoperatively was 0. 610 ± 0. 083, and that of patients accepting double knifed chopping(52 eyes) was 0. 643 ± 0. 072; the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. The differences on corneal edema and corneal astigmatism between the two methods at 1 d, 1 wk and 1 mo postoperatively were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION:The application of knifed <b>chopping</b> <b>with</b> closed hook and double knifed chopping in small incision extracapsular cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation can effectively treat with cataract with grade Ⅳ or higher. The most important difference is on the capsular rupture which causes the different recover periods after the two operations. There was no significant difference on postoperative corneal edema and astigmatism...|$|R

60|$|He {{came out}} of a doze that was half nightmare, to see the red-hued she- wolf before him. She was not more than half a dozen feet away sitting in the snow and wistfully {{regarding}} him. The two dogs were whimpering and snarling at his feet, but she took no notice of them. She was looking at the man, and for some time he returned her look. There was nothing threatening about her. She looked at him merely with a great wistfulness, but he knew it to be the wistfulness of an equally great hunger. He was the food, and the sight of him excited in her the gustatory sensations. Her mouth opened, the saliva drooled forth, and she licked her <b>chops</b> <b>with</b> the pleasure of anticipation.|$|E

It is this turning night into day that is killing us. We men, who have to go to business the next morning, ought to strike, and say that we won't go to anything later than eight-o'clock dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was their}} first breakfast together, and it spoke volumes to the rector. He knew what it implied. It stood for his elder sister Juliana's views on the need of {{personal}} sacrifice {{as a means of}} grace. The rector sighed as he rose. He had never missed his younger sister Philippa, now married and departed, so keenly. Philippa had had opinions of her own on bacon and eggs and on lamb <b>chops</b> <b>with</b> watercress as a means of stimulating the soul. But Juliana was different. The rector understood now exactly why it was that his father had exclaimed, on the news of Philippa's engagement, without a second's hesitation, [...] "Then, of course, Juliana must live with you! Nonsense, my dear boy, nonsense! It's my duty to spare her to you. After all, I can always eat at the club; they can give me a bite of something or other, surely. To a man of my age, Edward, food is really of no consequence. No, no; Juliana must move into the rectory at once." ...|$|E

60|$|At seven {{the three}} met again, {{and when the}} dinner {{was on the table}} there was some little trouble as to the helping of the fish. Which of the two men should take the lead on the occasion? But Clara decided the {{question}} by asking her cousin to make himself useful. There can be little doubt but that Captain Aylmer would have distributed the mutton <b>chops</b> <b>with</b> much more grace, and have carved the roast fowl with much more skill; but it suited Clara that Will should have the employment, and Will did the work. Captain Aylmer, throughout the dinner, endeavoured to be complaisant, and Clara exerted herself to talk as though all matters around them were easy. Will, too, made his effort, every now and then speaking a word, and restraining himself from snapping at his rival; but the restraint was in itself evident, and there were symptoms throughout the dinner that the untamed man was longing to fly at the throat of the man that was tamed.|$|E

The Story Girl and I were the only ones who could pay him compliments to his liking. The Story Girl would box his ears with her fist and say, [...] "Bless your gray heart, Paddy, you're a good sort of old rascal," [...] and Pat would purr his satisfaction; I used to take a handful of the skin on his back, shake him gently and say, [...] "Pat, you've forgotten more than any human being ever knew," [...] and I vow Paddy would lick his <b>chops</b> <b>with</b> delight.

60|$|The {{weather was}} charming, {{as the weather}} of the New York October is apt to be. The month proved much milder than September had been at Magnolia. They were not very far from Central Park, and they went for whole afternoons into it. They came {{to have such a}} sense of {{ownership}} in one of the seats in the Ramble, that they felt aggrieved when they found anybody had taken it, and they resented other people's intimacy with the squirrels, which Louise always took a pocketful of nuts to feed; the squirrels got a habit of climbing into her lap for them. Sometimes Maxwell hired a boat and rowed her lazily about on the lake, while he mused and she talked. Sometimes, to be very lavish, they took places in the public carriage which plied on the drives of the Park, and went up to the tennis-grounds beyond the reservoirs, and watched the players, or the art-students sketching the autumn scenery there. They began to know, without acquaintance, certain attached or semi-attached couples; and no doubt they passed with these for lovers themselves, though they felt a vast superiority to them in virtue of their married experience; they looked upon them, though the people were sometimes their elders, as very young things, who were in the right way, but were as yet deplorably ignorant how happy they were going to be. They almost always walked back from these drives, and it was not so far but they could walk over to the North River for the sunset before their dinner, which they had late when they did that, and earlier when they did not do it. Dinner was rather a matter of caprice with them. Sometimes they dined at a French or Italian table d'hôte; sometimes they foraged for it before they came in from their sunset, or their afternoon in the park. When dinner consisted mainly of a steak or <b>chops,</b> <b>with</b> one of the delicious salads their avenue abounded in, and some improvisation of potatoes, and coffee afterward, it was very easy to get it up in half an hour. They kept one maid, who called herself a Sweden's girl, and Louise cooked some of the things herself. She did not cook them so well as the maid, but Maxwell never knew what he was eating, and he thought it all alike good.|$|E
