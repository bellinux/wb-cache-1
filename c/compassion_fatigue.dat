25|$|The fast-paced and {{unpredictable}} nature {{of health care}} places nurses at risk for injuries and illnesses, including high occupational stress. Nursing is a particularly stressful profession, and nurses consistently identify stress as a major work-related concern and have among {{the highest levels of}} occupational stress when compared to other professions. This stress is caused by the environment, psychosocial stressors, and the demands of nursing, including new technology that must be mastered, the emotional labor involved in nursing, physical labor, shift work, and high workload. This stress puts nurses at risk for short-term and long-term health problems, including sleep disorders, depression, mortality, psychiatric disorders, stress-related illnesses, and illness in general. Nurses are at risk of developing <b>compassion</b> <b>fatigue</b> and moral distress, which can worsen mental health. They also have very high rates of occupational burnout (40%) and emotional exhaustion (43.2%). Burnout and exhaustion increase the risk for illness, medical error, and suboptimal care provision.|$|E

5000|$|The entrenched {{nature of}} {{violence}} in human behavior is generally well understood. The skill and potential of deadly aggression is something within human genetics which predisposes humans to violent behavior. However, the genetics that predispose humans to violence is highly influenced by environmental factors. Humans will only tap into their violent potential once the need has arisen. Human genetics have developed an on-off switch in the brain. On the on side [...] "…the fighting activity itself is stimulated by individual and communal thrill, enjoyment in the competitive exercise of spiritual and physical faculties, and even cruelty, blood lust, and killing ecstasy." [...] (Gat 2006) On the off-side violence is deterred away by emotions through fear, revulsion at violence and bloodshed, physical <b>fatigue,</b> <b>compassion,</b> and spirituality. So if the environmental factors that cause {{a man to be}} violent are present, then he will be violent. If the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are not present, he will abstain and deter violence.|$|R
40|$|The Solihull Approach was {{developed}} to help frontline workers {{be more effective in}} their work as they are in the ideal position to intervene early in any potential emotional or behavioural difficulty for a child. The Approach has been developed for both early years’ practitioners and those working with young people in their school years. The theoretical model has been developed from three concepts: containment, reciprocity, and behaviour management, taken from psychotherapeutic, child development and behavioural models respectively. A new programme specifically for schools, Understanding Your Pupils Behaviour, has been developed. At present most of the evaluation and research has been on the 0 - 5 -year work with Health Visitors. Further work needs to look at the effectiveness of this in the school years and in other settings outside of the health sector. The piloting of the Solihull Approach in a school setting to help school staff better understand their pupils’ behaviour provides an ideal opportunity {{to assess the impact of}} the approach in this setting. A mixed method design combining both quantitative measures and qualitative interviews was used to assess the impact of the training.

The teacher variables measured included anxiety, burnout, <b>compassion</b> satisfaction and <b>fatigue,</b> self-concept and teacher efficacy. Interviews with 7 school staff who have received the training were undertaken. Quantitative statistical analysis found that six months after training, teachers in School A showed a statistically significant increase in satisfaction with their helping role, self-esteem, and teacher efficacy scores as well as a decrease in feeling burnt out/stressed. The teachers at School B who did not receive the training only showed an improvement in teacher efficacy over the period. Qualitative thematic analysis found that overall, the teachers found that following aspects useful: that they were offered a framework that underpinned all aspects of the work they do; focus on the relationships not only with pupils, but teachers, support staff and parents as well; and the focus on well-being and its link with learning. Conclusions should be treated tentatively due to limitations associated with samples size, matching of school and the inability to control for other factors...|$|R

The current project was a collaboration between the developers of the approach, the schools and an applied psychology centre within a university interested in knowledge exchange with community based services. The university offered the training to the schools during inset and twilight training sessions. Six (one hour) follow up sessions with a group of staff have also been undertaken. A mixed method design combining both quantitative measures and qualitative interviews was used to assess the impact of the training.

5000|$|An {{early use}} of the term was in a 1981 US {{document}} on immigration policy. In the early 1990s the news media in the United States used the term to describe the public's lack of patience, or perhaps simply the editors' lack of patience, with [...] "the homeless problem," [...] which had previously been presented as an anomaly or even a [...] "crisis" [...] which had only existed for a short time and could presumably be solved somehow. The term was also used in 1992 when Joinson used the term in a nursing magazine to describe nurses who deal with hospital emergencies. <b>Compassion</b> <b>Fatigue</b> has been studied by the field of traumatology, where it has been called the [...] "cost of caring" [...] for people facing emotional pain. [...] <b>Compassion</b> <b>fatigue</b> has also been called [...] "secondary victimization" [...] (Figley, 1982), [...] "secondary traumatic stress" [...] (Figley, 1983, 1985, 1989; Stamm, 1995; 1997), [...] "vicarious traumatization" [...] (McCann and Pearlman, 1989; Pearlman & Saakvitne, 1995), and [...] "secondary survivor" [...] (Remer and Elliott, 1988a; 1988b). Other related conditions are [...] "rape-related family crisis" [...] (Erickson, 1989; White & Rollins, 1981), and [...] "proximity" [...] effects on female partners of war veterans (Verbosky and Ryan, 1988). <b>Compassion</b> <b>fatigue</b> has been called a form of burnout in some literature. However, unlike <b>compassion</b> <b>fatigue,</b> “burnout” is related to chronic tedium in careers and the workplace, rather than exposure to specific kinds of client problems such as trauma. fMRI-rt utilized research suggests the idea of compassion without engaging in real-life trauma is not exhausting itself. According to these, when empathy was analyzed with compassion through neuroimaging, empathy showed brain region activation's where previously identified to be related to pain whereas compassion showed warped neural activation's.|$|E

50|$|<b>Compassion</b> <b>fatigue,</b> {{also known}} as {{secondary}} traumatic stress (STS), is a condition characterized by a gradual lessening of compassion over time.

40|$|Background : Family {{caregivers}} for {{a parent}} with dementia often experience negative emotional consequences. These caregivers may also {{be at risk for}} <b>compassion</b> <b>fatigue,</b> a concept that was introduced to the health care community as feelings of anger, inefficacy, apathy, and depression resulting from a caregiver's inability to cope with devastating stress. <b>Compassion</b> <b>fatigue</b> was first observed in nurses and later in other caring professionals such as social workers and psychologists and the definition was adapted to focus on prolonged exposure to suffering as one of the primary causes. Although <b>compassion</b> <b>fatigue</b> has not been studied in family caregivers providing care at home, their experiences, particularly those of adult daughter caregivers for parents with dementia, appear to create a foundation for developing <b>compassion</b> <b>fatigue.</b> For this reason, it was important to investigate <b>compassion</b> <b>fatigue</b> in this growing population of caregivers and this dissertation explored <b>compassion</b> <b>fatigue</b> in daughter caregivers for parents with dementia. The dissertation aims were to 1) identify common themes across the literature on <b>compassion</b> <b>fatigue</b> and to apply these themes and the existing model of <b>compassion</b> <b>fatigue</b> to informal caregivers for family members with dementia, 2) analyze secondary data from Project ASSIST to substantiate a need for further study of <b>compassion</b> <b>fatigue</b> in adult daughter caregivers of a parent with dementia, 3) explore the feasibility of studying <b>compassion</b> <b>fatigue</b> in family caregivers, and 4) explore <b>compassion</b> <b>fatigue</b> and the contributing factors and potential outcomes of <b>compassion</b> <b>fatigue</b> in adult daughter caregivers for parents with dementia. Methods : The dissertation consisted of three studies. The first study, {{a review of the literature}} addressed aim 1 of the dissertation as I applied the established model of <b>compassion</b> <b>fatigue</b> to family caregivers. The second study, a secondary analysis pilot study addressed aim 2 and aim 3 of the dissertation study. The third study of the dissertation was a qualitative study exploring the concept of <b>compassion</b> <b>fatigue</b> in daughter caregivers for parents with dementia. Conclusions : The literature review found evidence to support the components of the established model of <b>compassion</b> <b>fatigue</b> and findings suggested additional work was needed on the concept of <b>compassion</b> <b>fatigue</b> in family caregivers. Findings from the secondary analysis provided support for more in-depth exploration of the concept of <b>compassion</b> <b>fatigue</b> in family caregivers. Findings from the larger qualitative study provided support for many of the factors related to <b>compassion</b> <b>fatigue,</b> but also suggested revisions to the established model of <b>compassion</b> <b>fatigue</b> were needed. A revised model was created based upon the findings from this dissertation. The revised model incorporates the contributing factors and moderators of <b>compassion</b> <b>fatigue</b> found in family caregivers and the model also proposes revised characteristics and outcomes of <b>compassion</b> <b>fatigue.</b> Findings from this dissertation also suggest new areas for research, specifically with all dementia caregivers and caregivers who do not utilize formal or informal support. Additional value from this dissertation derives from the detailed explanation of previous relationship quality, empathy, and caregiving experience. This dissertation is one of a few qualitative studies on <b>compassion</b> <b>fatigue</b> to provide this level of detail and serves to anchor future research on <b>compassion</b> <b>fatigue</b> in all family caregivers.
