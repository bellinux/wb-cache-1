2500|$|The {{outcome of}} the {{interview}} between Law and Asquith was clear, even if Law had not been. Asquith immediately decided that an accommodation with Lloyd George, and a substantial reconstruction to placate the Unionist ministers, were required. He summoned Lloyd George and together they agreed a compromise that was, in fact, little different to Lloyd George's 1 December proposals. The only substantial amendment was that Asquith would have daily oversight of the War Council's work and a right of veto. Grigg sees this compromise as [...] "very favourable to Asquith." [...] Cassar is less certain; [...] "The new formula left him in a much weaker position authority merely on paper for he was unlikely to exercise his veto lest it bring on the <b>collective</b> <b>resignation</b> of the War Council."

40|$|In {{the present}} study the nature of stress and coping was {{investigated}} and considered as socially constructed. Thirty small group interviews were performed using the Critical Incident Technique in one female- and one male-dominated customer service department of a telecom company. The main themes about stress among {{both women and men}} were often expressed as collective phenomena and were connected to the organizational change and downsizing process, problems when carrying out the work and lack of autonomy. However, a striking difference between female and male interviews was found in the way that women to a greater extent expressed lack of autonomy and their working situation was described as strictly regulated. The findings illustrate that a traditional gender difference regarding autonomy could be found when comparing a female- and a male-dominated department even though they were performing the same type of job. Both women and men portrayed coping as a mixture of collective and individual strategies. They often mentioned <b>collective</b> acceptance, <b>resignation</b> and hardening. There is a need for further research about women and men at work, taking into consideration the interpersonal context and the collective nature of stress and coping...|$|R
5000|$|Laval's {{actions were}} {{a factor in}} his {{dismissal}} on 13 December 1940. Pétain asked all the ministers to sign a <b>collective</b> letter of <b>resignation</b> during a full cabinet meeting. Laval did so thinking it was a device {{to get rid of}} M. Belin, the Minister of Labor. He was therefore stunned when the Marshal announced, [...] "the resignations of MM. Laval and Ripert are accepted." [...] That evening, Laval was arrested and driven by the police to his home in Châteldon. The following day, Pétain announced his decision to remove Laval from the government. The reason for Laval's dismissal lies in a fundamental incompatibility with Pétain. Laval's methods of working appeared slovenly to Petain's precise military mind, and he showed a marked lack of deference, instanced by a habit of blowing cigarette smoke in Pétain's face. By doing so he aroused Pétain's irritation and the anger of the entire cabinet.|$|R

Mobilizing for <b>collective</b> <b>resignation,</b> activist nurses navigate terrains of neoliberal governance, marketization and flexible labour-market dynamics. The <b>collective</b> <b>resignation</b> is also a form of action underpinned by a discourse of gender equality. Our analysis, which attends to the co-emergence of gendering and subject formation in the narratives {{of a group of}} activists and to the use of gender-equality rhetoric in framing collective action, shows how opportunities for collective action arise that also restrain the exercise of agency. In this case, subject formation included contrasting nursing to tropes of archetypical militant workers and negotiating tensions between care and collective action. This involved reproducing and challenging established forms of gendering...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This article {{seeks to}} shed light on the sources of government-opposition {{dynamics}} in the European Union (EU). It considers the ideological left-right divide and the sovereignty-integration dimension as potential sources of a government-opposition cleav-age in the EU, as well as a ‘representation dimension’. The empirical evaluation of these propositions is based on a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the political crisis leading to the <b>collective</b> <b>resignation</b> of the Santer Commission. The article finds that government-opposition dynamics in the EU are related to the sovereignty-integration dimension of EU politics and to representation in EU executive institutions, rather than a left-right divide. Both political beliefs and opportunistic motivations determine government-support and opposition in the EU...|$|E
40|$|I {{develop a}} model of (individually rational) {{collective}} reality denial in groups, organizations and markets. Whether participants' tendencies toward wishful thinking reinforce or dampen each other is shown to hinge on a simple and novel mechanism. When an agent can expect to benefit from other's delusions, this makes him more of a realist; when he {{is more likely to}} suffer losses from them this pushes him toward denial, which becomes contagious. This general "Mutually Assured Delusion" principle can give rise to multiple social cognitions of reality, irrespective of any strategic payoff interactions or private signals. It also implies that in hierachical organizations realism or denial will trickle down, causing subordinates to take their mindsets and beliefs from the leaders. Contagious "exuberance" can also seize asset markets, leading to evidence-resistant investment frenzies and subsequent deep crashes. In addition to collective illusions of control, the model accounts for the mirror case of fatalism and <b>collective</b> <b>resignation.</b> The welfare analysis differentiates valuable group morale from harmful groupthink and identifies a fundamental tension in organizations' attitudes toward free speech and dissent. ...|$|E
