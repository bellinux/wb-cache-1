He {{argued that}} the ongoing {{financial}} crisis was made more severe by inherent weaknesses of the current international monetary system {{and called for a}} gradual move towards using IMF special drawing rights (SDRs) as a centrally managed global reserve currency. He argued that it would address the inadequacies of using a national currency as a global reserve currency, particularly the Triffin dilemma, the dilemma faced by issuing countries in trying to simultaneously achieve their domestic monetary policy goals and meet other countries' demand for reserve currency. Zhou explained global <b>currency</b> <b>diversification</b> was needed because an overconcentration of foreign assets denominated in the dollar may bring about undesired consequences. Zhou argued that it was regrettable that John Maynard Keynes's [...] "farsighted" [...] bancor proposal was not adopted at Bretton Woods in the 1940s.|$|E
40|$|Assets {{of banks}} located in France are mainly {{denominated}} in euro and in US dollar. <b>Currency</b> <b>diversification,</b> which measures {{how much of}} assets are denominated in US dollar, implies a credit risk diversification and a valuation effect on assets. As <b>currency</b> <b>diversification</b> affects directly the total converted value of assets, it changes banks’ debt capacity and their resilience to economic shocks. Thereby, <b>currency</b> <b>diversification</b> of assets should affect leverage responsiveness {{to the value of}} assets, namely the leverage procyclicality. Using innovative data on credit institutions located in France between 1999 and 2014, we examine whether US dollar diversification of assets is pertinent for the analysis of leverage procyclicality. Focusing on investment banks, our results suggest that the net effect of US dollar diversification is dominated by the valuation effect. After extracting the valuation effect of diversification, it also posits the importance of two opposite effects in leverage procyclicality. Additionally, our results confirms the theoretical prediction where currency mismatch does not affect leverage procyclicality. Implicitly it supports the idea that leverage procyclicality is only driven by assets. Finally, our conclusions support the idea that US dollar diversification is relevant to the analysis of leverage procyclicality especially for the post crisis period...|$|E
40|$|The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has {{introduced}} in December 2010 a Basel III framework for more resilient banks and banking system. We posit {{in this paper}} that, {{in addition to the}} current regulatory instruments currently under the review of authorities, the <b>currency</b> <b>diversification</b> of banks’ balance sheets can be a source of banking stability considering both assets and liabilities simultaneously. Our conclusions are based on a simplified definition of a globalized bank’s balance sheet. As banks’ balance sheets are expressed in domestic currency, our model implies an exchange rate conversion of each foreign component. Risks are introduced with stochastic processes in assets, liabilities and exchange rate. In accordance with the Basel III framework and the Basel III Leverage ratio, the bank’s leverage ratio is limited. Our model provides detailed information in each risk faced by global banks including foreign exchange risk. Although our conclusions depend on the variance covariance matrix of assets, liabilities and foreign exchange rate, our main results confirm the positive impact of <b>currency</b> <b>diversification</b> on banking stability considering the current banking system...|$|E

40|$|In {{the first}} chapter, I apply a new microeconometric technique, the Synthetic Control method, to {{construct}} a counterfactual JPY-USD exchange rate {{in the absence of}} large scale intervention by the Japanese monetary authority from the start of 2003 to March 2004, and evaluate the effect of foreign exchange intervention on JPY-USD exchange rate as average treatment effects. I provide empirical evidence suggesting that Japanese intervention may have forced the JPY to depreciate during {{the first phase of the}} period, but the effects are likely to have been very small. On the other hand, the final phase of the large-scale JPY-selling intervention from the late 2003 to the first quarter of 2004 had no effect or opposite effects on the JPY. In the second chapter, I deal with the return-chasing and risk-diversification motives as determinants of cross border asset holdings, and estimate a financial gravity equation to explain US investors' behavior during the periods including the recent financial crisis. A simple pooled OLS regression presents a correlation puzzle. Once the riskiness of foreign asset holdings and the US business cycle are controlled for in the fixed effect model, the correlation puzzle disappears on average for the foreign bond holdings by the US residents. On the other hand, the data support the return chasing motive only for their foreign equity holdings. In the third chapter, I investigate the <b>currency</b> <b>diversification</b> of international reserves by monetary authorities. Apart from the mean-variance approach, monetary authorities are likely to pay attention to the impact of the <b>currency</b> <b>diversification</b> on the anticipated liquidation of the outputs and reserves during the sudden stop crises, as well as the expected higher returns of alternative reserve currencies. A model simulation indicates that industrial countries have little incentive to diversify their reserve currency composition since their anticipated liquidation costs under the sudden stop crisis are large. On the other hand, developing countries anticipate the higher excess returns of alternative reserve currencies, and have stronger incentives for the <b>currency</b> <b>diversification.</b> Indeed, my empirical results confirm this implication...|$|E

40|$|The brutal {{adjustments}} to global banks’ balance sheets {{in the wake}} of the recent economic crisis have rekindled interest in the procyclicality of banking leverage. During economic bursts, the collateral value of banks decreases and their risk-taking capacity is reduced. Banks raise less funds and their leverage - defined as total assets over equity - goes down: the leverage is procyclical. The paper investigates the procyclicality of bank leverage when banks can borrow and invest in two different currencies, as with European banks.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a dynamic portfolio model under currency inconvertibility which rationalizes the recent Egyptian experience of real exchange rate appreciation and <b>currency</b> <b>diversification</b> following {{the increase in}} oil exports and the partial financial liberalization that took place after 1976.

The effects of various official exchange rate policies on the temporary equilibrium values of the premium and the real wage and on the steady-state values of asset stocks are examined. A review of the Egyptian experience shows that as the model suggests the official devaluation of 1979 was ineffective against the "Egyptian disease" so that little can be expected from the 1981 devaluation.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is twofold. First it aims to compare several GARCH family models in order to model and {{forecast}} the conditional variance of German, Swiss, and UK stock market indexes. The main result is that all GARCH family models show evidence of asymmetric effects. Based on the “out of sample” forecasts I can say that for each market considered there is a model that will lead to better volatility forecasts. Secondly a long run relation between these markets was investigated using the cointegration methodology. Cointegration tests show that DAX 30, FTSE 100, and SMI indexes move together in the long term. The VECM model indicates a positive long run relation among these indexes, while the error correction terms indicate that the Swiss market is the initial receptor of external shocks. One of the main findings of this analysis is that although the UK, Switzerland and Germany do not share a common <b>currency,</b> the <b>diversification</b> benefits of investing in these countries could be very low given that their stock markets seem to move together in the lung term. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the composition of exporters' currency pricing portfolio - number and value of product sales in different currencies at a destination - and their success in trade as measured by continuing to their exporting activity. Detailed investigation of currency choice data of Russian exporters between 2005 - 2009 shows that many exporters use only one currency pricing per destination. Among those who use more than one <b>currency</b> pricing, higher <b>diversification</b> is indeed associated with up to 18 % higher odds of survival as an exporter at the product-destination. Nevertheless, many exporters still use only one currency pricing per destination. This puzzle is explained in this paper by incorporating the concept of "exchange rate hedging costs" into the existent literature on currency choice.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} topic of {{diversification}} opportunities in international real estate, with focus on private real estate markets in developed countries. In examining the characteristics of returns and interrelatedness between international real estate, stocks and bonds markets from the time period spanning 2000 to 2009, we find that 2008 was the only year within the past decade in which several countries saw synchronized negative returns on a calendar year basis in the stocks and real estate markets, and even so the synchronized negative returns was only experienced by half of the countries within the 10 -country opportunity set. The amplitude of the peak to trough drop in the cumulative value of the assets was small in real estate on average relative to that of stocks. These findings suggest that investors' should benefit from holding international real estate within their portfolios, even in an extreme down market. Modern portfolio theory is used to analyze and compare ex-ante diversification opportunities in international real estate, stocks and bonds and domestic diversification opportunities for the three asset classes {{from the perspectives of}} U. S. and European investors. We project expected returns for each of the markets and used historical risks (volatility) from the 2000 - 2009 period as estimates for volatility. When returns are calculated in local <b>currencies,</b> international <b>diversification</b> in the real estate portfolio (diversified within a 10 -country opportunity set) should help U. S. investors substantially improve their portfolio risk-return efficiency relative to domestic diversification (within a 6 -metropolitan area opportunity set), as the markets within the U. S. domestic opportunity set provide unattractive risk-return efficiency and their movements are highly correlated. By contrast, European investors will benefit less from the same international diversification strategy relative to domestic diversification (within 5 Eurozone countries) as several Eurozone markets are able to provide considerable risk-return efficiency and low correlations can be found in some pairs of markets. Applying home bias and limits on exposure to any single country i. e. country caps to the portfolio allocation helps to balance the allocation weights for the investor's portfolio but also significantly limits the investor's ability to take advantage of diversification opportunities provided by the international markets. When returns are calculated in the investors' domestic currencies, additional currency risk increases the portfolio volatility without providing additional expected return, reducing diversification benefits of international real estate. Even so, international diversification potential to U. S. investors should still be considerable, while that to European investors' should be minimal. by Onousa Boontanorm. Thesis (S.

40|$|We {{build an}} {{optimising}} framework to analyse {{a class of}} economies that adopt an ECU-type basket currency while in transition to increased flexibility of the exchange rate regime. Instead of conventional basket pegging, such an economy uses an ECU-type currency index as a benchmark for monitoring and assessing exchange rate movements. This provides an anchoring device for the nation’s exchange rate regime and allows the home currency’s exchange rate to fluctuate. Under {{the assumption that the}} central bank is chiefly interested in maintaining stability, the optimal structure of the basket currency is based on its contribution to minimizing the volatility of the country’s external account. A currency invariance index is applied to capture the effect of the country’s exit from exclusive linkage with the US dollar. The approach is illustrated by Chinese exchange rate policy. We find it advisable and viable for China to form a basket currency with a diversified portfolio of currencies.

40|$|Excerpt] The {{exchange}} {{rate of the}} dollar is largely determined by the market—the supply and demand for dollars in global foreign exchange markets associated with the buying and selling of dollar denominated goods, services, and assets (e. g., stocks, bonds, real property) on global markets. In most circumstances, however, international asset-market transactions will tend to be dominant, with the size and strength of inflows and outflows of capital ultimately determining whether the {{exchange rate}} appreciates or depreciates. A variety of factors can influence the size and direction of cross-border asset flows. Of principal importance are the likely {{rate of return on}} the asset, investor expectations about a currency’s future path, the size and liquidity of the country’s asset markets, the need for <b>currency</b> <b>diversification</b> in international investors’ portfolios, changes in the official holdings of foreign exchange reserves by central banks, and the need for and location of investment safe havens. All of these factors could themselves be influenced by economic policy choices. To give Congress the economic context in which to view the dollar’s recent and prospective movement, this report analyzes the evolution of the exchange rate since its peak in 2002. It examines several factors that are likely to influence the dollar’s medium-term path, what effects a depreciating dollar could have on the economy, and how alternative policy measures that could be taken by the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and the 112 th Congress might influence the dollar’s path...|$|E
40|$|We {{assess the}} new EU {{directive}} for insurance companies, Solvency II, {{with regards to}} solvency capital requirement (SCR) from currency risk and its implications on risk management for Norwegian life insurers. The SCR is designed to offset losses during extreme market conditions. We question whether the direct adoption of the standard formula stipulated in the directive is reasonable for the Norwegian insurance market, as the Norwegian krone has historically had different characteristics than the euro. The parameter of interest is the input correlation factor between currencies and equities due to {{its impact on the}} SCR from <b>currency</b> risk through <b>diversification</b> effects. In the standard formula, this parameter is currently set to 0. 25. We conduct this assessment by creating a back-testing model with a sample period from 2003 to 2015 for international equity portfolios with various hedge ratios and computing the corresponding SCR. To ensure quality and relevance we have based our assumptions in the model on information from interviews with five major life insurers in Norway. We find that a hedged portfolio underperforms its unhedged counterpart with respect to rate of return, volatility and, in particular, downside volatility. Downside volatility is what Norwegian life insurers mainly focus on because of the asymmetric payoff profile of their defined benefit pension products. By performing correlation and regression analyses, we find that the superior performance of the unhedged portfolio is caused by a predominantly negative correlation between the returns of the Norwegian krone (NOK) and international equity markets. This is due to the NOK’s risk-on characteristics, meaning that the currency is negatively correlated with the risk perception in financial markets. We thus argue that adopting the input correlation parameter from the standard formula is questionable as it contradicts these historical market dynamics. Furthermore, we find that the SCR from currency risk is significantly dependent on the input correlation factor, meaning that Solvency II will incentivize Norwegian life insurers not to lower their hedge ratios, and by doing so, might work against its goal of increasing financial stability. nhhma...|$|R
40|$|We {{have defined}} the Baltic Sea Region as {{consisting}} of the following countries and regions : Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Sweden, and the regions of St Petersburg, Leningrad Oblast and Kaliningrad in Russia. We have investigated the factors af-fecting FDI in the Baltic Sea Region in three ways. First, we have studied the factors affecting FDI {{on the basis of}} the existing theoretical and empirical literature. Secondly, we have studied the characteristics of the existing FDI in the Baltic Sea Region. Thirdly, we have researched the investment motives through two firm questionnaires : 1) firms participating in the MIPIM real estate fairs and 2) Finnish firms active in the Baltic Sea Region (Finpro register). The common results of both empirical enquiries were : 1) the most important reasons for FDI are market size and its growth potential, 2) companies do not see the BSR as a single market in their actual decision making process, 3) there are clear benefits in having the non-Euro area countries as members of the EMU, but the results are not very robust : obviously they are weakened by the already rather credible pegs of the Estonian, Danish, Latvian and Lithuanian <b>currencies</b> and the <b>diversification</b> benefits of the floating Swedish krone, and 4) governmental investment promotion organizations have a rather small role in the actual investment decision making process. Their role is rather in giving general information on the countrys investment environment. The most important differences between the samples of firms are : 1) in the real estate sector the majority of FDI is done through buying an existing firm, whereas in the sample of Finnish firms most FDI is done as a greenfield investment (establishing a new firm), 2) among the real estate firms Sweden, Finland, Germany and Poland are the most important destinations for FDI, while in the Finnish sample of firms (including more manufacturing and service firms) St Petersburg, Poland, Estonia and Sweden are the most important destinations, 3) in the sample of real estate firms R&D and the proximity of the Russian market are not important motives for FDI, contrary to the Finnish, more manufacturing and retail trade-oriented sample, and 4) among the real estate firms the potential for large increases in real estate prices is an important motive for FDI.

A third feature that distinguishes our investigation from most other studies on this topic is the analysis of the effects of <b>currency</b> hedging on <b>diversification</b> benefits. At a quick glance the CEE equity markets seem to offer significant and high diversification benefits. But this picture becomes cloudy after a thorough analysis. Only the equity markets of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia contribute significantly to the diversification benefits. But a realisation of these benefits would imply to have not only long but also short positions in CEE equities. Taken into account transaction costs and limited access to futures and options markets it seems to be very doubtful that the theoretical diversification benefits can actually be realised. This result is in correspondence with recent studies on other emerging markets such as DeRoon/Nijman/Werker (2000). The results of the study also show that the home currency of the investor is of some importance for the results of the spanning tests. The outcomes for British, German and U. S. investors are similar but not identical. Therefore it seems to be useful to analyse benefits of diversification not only {{from the point of view}} of U. S. investors but to take explicitly into account the currency of the investor. Another interesting result is that currency hedging clearly improves the possible performance of an investment in CEE equity markets. What is now the consequence for investors that consider an investment in CEE equity markets? Our study comes to the result that a buy-and-hold investor could hardly benefit from such an investment.

40|$|The {{economic}} (debt) {{crisis has}} become serious in the EU {{and in the}} Eurozone especially {{in the last few}} months. The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) was created as an instrument to handle this situation. But the financial contributions of the EU Member States seem not to be enough and China appears as a potential contributor. It is often cited that China offered Portugal and Spain in March 2011 to support their crisis management. However, recently, there are attempts {{from the side of the}} EU to convince China take part in the EFSF. Thus the question raised often in Europe is the following: Will China contribute to the EFSF? If yes, what conditions will the country raise? What are the arguments of the Chinese capital both in China and the EU? Consequently, our research is focusing on the impacts of the global financial and economic crisis on the new relations between the European Union and China. China’s enormous reserves enable the Asian financial assistance to European countries in crisis management but there are a number of questions related to this. The main findings of this study are that China can benefit from its European crisis management from many aspects, as the EU is the largest market for the Chinese products. Furthermore, reserve <b>currency</b> <b>diversification</b> and political considerations cannot be neglected, either. But the assistance may have serious risks for China: not only the expected return on investment is at a stake, but internal social and political tensions can emerge from helping the Europeans who still live in significantly higher wealth than most of the Chinese people. Adopting Chinese capital raises questions for the European Union, as well. China may impose such terms by which the EU may become vulnerable and get into a dependent position, then presumably it will be difficult to solve the cooperation. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} is constructed {{to address the}} issue of structure management for colossal foreign exchange reserves holders, such as China and other emerging economies. Contrary to the discussion of optimal quantity on the reserve level, structure management considers the ideal applications of the national wealth, specifically the compositions in the reserves' financial investments. Two perspectives are considered for the safety and liquidity tranche of the foreign reserves, and another one for the return tranche. The thwo perspectives are further developed into three chapters of this thesis and they form a comprehensive set of analyses for the structure management. First, the optimal currency composition for huge foreign reserves in the safety and liquidity tranche is investigated. The asymmetry fat-tails and complex dependence structure in distributions of currency returns are examined for their vital role in the portfolio risk appraisal. In a D-vine copula approach, it is shown that under the disappointment aversion effect, the central bank in our model can achieve sizeable gains in economic value by switching from the mean-variance to copula modelling. It is also found that this approach will lead to an optimal currency composition that allows China to have more space for international <b>currency</b> <b>diversification,</b> while maintaining the leading position of the US dollar in the currency shares of China’s reserves. Next, the strategic asset allocation for China’s foreign reserves in the same safety tranche is studied using a risk-based approach. Four aspects of the risk management are investigated: investment universe, dependence structure, allocation strategies under risk minimization and trade-off between risks and returns. A regime-switching copula model is developed to investigate the dynamic dependence between assets. The optimal allocation is derived following two strategies: risk minimization and trade-off between risk and returns in utility maximization with disappointment avoidance. If the central bank focuses solely on risk minimization, the asymmetries in the asset return dependence encourage the flight to safety. However, if higher risks are allowed in exchange for higher returns, even if the exchange is very conservative, the asymmetries would discourage the flight to safety. Therefore, we suggest that China should mitigate its flight to safety after 2008 and increase holdings of short-term bank deposits, long-term treasury bonds and euro bonds. Finally, the strategic asset allocation problem for China's Sovereign Wealth Fund, the China Investment Corporation, is examined. This is considered to be the return tranche of China's foreign reserves. Bearing the responsibility to pursue higher returns for China's huge volume of foreign exchange reserves, the China Investment Corporation is endowed with a capable funding position. However, its emphasis on safety is still considered more serious than that of other institutional investors. A new method combining the merits of the shrinkage estimation, vine-copula structure, and Black-Litterman model, is proposed and tested to satisfy the revealed investment objectives. Empirical analysis suggests that there is more emphasis on emerging market economies rather than advanced economies when diversifying in fixed-income securities; whereas that emphasis is reversed on the equities side. In addition, using the commodity ETFs to represent the significance of gold in the portfolio, it is discovered that gold is a formidable competitor to the investment in equities...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} external and domestic influences on Latin America’s economic performance {{over the past}} decade and a half. It notes that over the past few years, macroeconomic policies have strengthened and structural reforms have been implemented. Together with a favorable external environment, these policies have contributed to Latin America’s relatively sharp economic recovery from its last recession. The study discusses the priorities for the region’s reform agenda that could help to ensure that this growing prosperity becomes entrenched. It also makes observations on the future roles of the major policymakers involved [...] the governments in the region; the international financial institutions, and especially the IMF; and industrial country governments.
