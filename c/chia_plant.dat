50|$|Gaspar’s maque {{projects}} {{start with}} wooden pieces already formed by other artisans, usually made from Alnus jorullensis (Mexican alder) or Tilia mexicana (Cirimo) as both {{are low in}} resin content and absorb the maque better. Before the process begins, the piece is thoroughly dried, alternating between sun and shade, turning the pieces {{so that they do}} not warp or split. Then they are sanded thoroughly and sometimes repaired with plaster. The decorating and lacquering processes are intricate and require patience. Maque is lacquer made from the seeds of the <b>chia</b> <b>plant,</b> mixed with crushed aje, an insect found in various parts of Mexico. In Michoacán it comes from the Tierra Caliente region. Gaspar insists on chia oil, even though some artisans have switched to linseed. He states that the latter is not of the same quality and is not water resistant.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Medicinal {{plants with}} {{essential}} oils in their composition havetypicallybeen {{shown to be}} promising in plant control. Sage (Salvia officinalis L.) is cited for its allelopathic effects. This study evaluated the allelopathic potential of dried sage leaves in vegetation, soil {{and the development of}} Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. (tomato), Panicum maximum Jacq. (guinea grass) and Salvia hispanica L. (<b>chia)</b> <b>plants.</b> Three seedlings were transplanted seven days after germination in 1 kg plastic containers with soil, in a greenhouse. The grinded dry mass of sage was placed at rates of 3. 75; 7. 5 15 t ha- 1, and a control (no mass). After 30 days, the chlorophyll index of tomato and guinea grass plants were inhibited with 7. 5 and 15 t ha- 1 sage cover crops. Tomato shoot length was inhibited in all tested rates, and guinea grass plants showed some reduction in growth when using the highest rate of sage mass (15 t ha- 1). The dry mass of tomato and guinea grass plants was reduced when using the 15 t ha- 1, and 7. 5 and 15 t ha- 1 of sage cover crops, respectively. It can be concluded that there was some effect of sage coverage on the soil in tomato and guinea grass, but no effect was observed on <b>chia</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{chemical}} composition and growth responses of <b>chia</b> <b>plants</b> (Salvia hispanica L.) to inoculation with an arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM, Glomus mosseae, Nicol. & Gerd.) fungal inoculum (namely MC 10) {{under the influence}} of soil pH were investigated. The experiment project included six treatments, i. e., control-non-arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (NAMF, pH 7. 1), control-arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF, pH 7. 1), acid-NAMF (pH 5. 1), acid-AMF (pH 5. 1), alkaline-NAMF (pH 8. 2), and alkaline-AMF (pH 8. 2). Stunted growth and leaf chlorosis were noticed mainly in plants grown in soil with acidic pH. An increase in fresh biomass was attained in plants amended with AM fungi in alkaline soil pH. Alkaline sandy soil with low levels of available P stimulated AMF colonization of chia roots, which subsequently enhanced P uptake and translocation in plant tissues. Total proteins, carbohydrates, and total fat content in leaves increased in AMF-inoculated plants in neutral and alkaline soil pH, while only fat content enhanced under acidic soil pH. MC 10 inoculum resulted in reduced levels of total phenolics under alkaline conditions, whereas under acidic soil resulted in increased levels compared to the non-inoculated plants. The predominant fatty acids of chia leaves were palmitic (18. 3  %), a-linolenic (17. 1  %), pentadecenoic (11. 0  %), linoleic (7. 5  %), oleic (7. 5  %), and stearic (6. 3  %). Higher concentration of stearic, oleic, linoleic, and a-linolenic acids was observed in the leaves of <b>chia</b> <b>plants</b> grown on control (neutral pH) and alkaline soil {{in the presence of the}} MC 10 inoculum. Alkaline soil combined with AM inoculation enhanced the nutritional value of chia leaves. © 2015, Botanical Society of Sao Paulo...|$|R

Stems section were the best explant source for starting in vitro cultures. Both IAA and NAA, at all the concentration tested {{with or without the}} addition of citokinines, have induced the development of adventitious roots both in darkness as in light. In darkness, 2, 4 -D (2. 25 mM) has induced the development of S. hispanica embryogenic tissues and in light promoted the initiation and establishment of green, and fast-growing calli that lost their friability with time. When subcultured to MS culture media with NAA:kin (0. 54 mM: 0. 46 mM) or Picloram (1. 72 mM, 3. 43 mM) as plant growth regulators, calli maintained friability for two years in culture. It was possible to detect fatty acid content in the calli obtained but the values remained significant lower than those of seeds.

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScSalvia hispanica L. is {{an annual}} pseudocereal food crop, locally known as chia {{that has the}} ability to grow in water stress environments. The {{importance}} of chia dates back to the pre-columbian era where it was consumed as staple food by the indigenous South Americans due to its high nutritional and medicinal benefits. A single <b>chia</b> <b>plant</b> produces two seed variants: white seed genotype (denoted as WSG) and black seed genotype (denoted as BSG). Chia seeds have been proven to have a huge potential as a healthy food source and contained various medicinal properties. However, these plants are still prone to environmental stress conditions such as salinity {{that is one of the}} major abiotic stresses that influence crop production and yield worldwide. Despite the nutritional impact of the chia seeds, limited information regarding their molecular responses to abiotic stress conditions are known. This study was divided into two distinct parts. Firstly, the study comparatively analysed the leaf proteomes of two chia genotypes using gelbased proteomic analysis coupled with mass spectrometry. Total soluble proteins were extracted from chia leaves and subjected to 2 -D PAGE analysis. Proteins were visualized by CBB and identified by MALDI-TOF MS/MS. A total of 284 and 209 spots were detected in WSG and BSG, respectively. Using mass spectrometry, 36 differentially expressed protein spots were successfully identified based on their protein abundance using homology database searches. Interestingly, two defensive-related proteins (osmotin-like protein and the chalcone isomerase) were only present in WSG and absent in BSG. In light of previous information regarding the nutritional profiles (no significant difference) of these two genotypes, this study has shown that there are distinct molecular differences between these genotypes. Therefore, WSG will be used in further downstream analysis. The second part of this study focused on the influence of salt stress (imposed by 100 mM NaCl) on the leaf proteome of WSG. Using gel-based proteomic analysis, 61 differentially expressed proteins were identified and classified into nine functional categories. Most of the proteins identified in this study were upregulated by salt stress. Interesting to note, 12 proteins identified in this study were only present in response to salt stress but were absent in the control. These proteins include ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease FTSH 2 (spot 48), HSP 70 proteins (spots 46 and 47), superoxide dismutases (spots 10, 41 and 42) and an ascorbate peroxidase (spot 56). All these proteins are important antioxidants that play a significant role in scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). Previous studies have shown that these antioxidants play vital roles in stress tolerance. These proteins could serve as potential biomarkers that could be used to enhance salt stress tolerance in pseudocereals and cereal food crops.

40|$|Biotechnology {{has allowed}} the {{development}} of novel strategies to obtain plants that are more resistant to pests, fungal pathogens and other agents of biotic stress.

40|$|Mastic {{oil from}} Pistacia {{lentiscus}} var. <b>chia,</b> a natural <b>plant</b> extract traditionally {{used as a}} food additive, has been extensively studied for its antimicrobial activity attributed to the combination of its bioactive components. One of them, perillyl alcohol (POH), displays tumor chemopreventive, chemotherapeutic, and antiangiogenic properties. We investigated whether mastic oil would also suppress tumor cell growth and angiogenesis. We observed that mastic oil concentration and time dependently exerted an antiproliferative and proapoptotic effect on K 562 human leukemia cells and inhibited the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from K 562 and B 16 mouse melanoma cells. Moreover, mastic oil caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of endothelial cell (EC) proliferation without affecting cell survival and a significant decrease of microvessel formation both in vitro and in vivo. Investigation of underlying mechanism(s) demonstrated that mastic oil reduced 1) in K 562 cells the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 / 2 (Erk 1 / 2) known to control leukemia cell proliferation, survival, and VEGF secretion and 2) in EC the activation of RhoA, an essential regulator of neovessel organization. Overall, our results underscore that mastic oil, through its multiple effects on malignant cells and ECs, may be a useful natural dietary supplement for cancer prevention.

40|$|Salvia hispanica L., {{known as}} <b>chia,</b> is a <b>plant</b> species {{originally}} from tropical and subtropical Mesoamerica. It is economically important because its seeds produce omega- 3, thus its demand {{has increased in}} Chile and internationally. As there is no commercial production in Chile, we investigated the {{places in the country}} where this species could be cultivated in order to satisfy at the least the national demand. The aim {{of the study was to}} quantify the main climatic requirements of chia and to produce a climatic aptitude map for chia cultivation in Chile. The methodology was based on the Maxent species distribution model. We used 78 georeferenced data points where chia is grown throughout the world, mostly from the GBIF database, along with raster climatic layers from the Worldclim project. We estimated the performance curves of annual precipitation and temperature along with their respective optimal and critical values, in analogy with the Ecocrop method. The maps used two scenarios for crops in different conditions, with and without irrigation. The results indicated that the intermediate depression and coastal edge of mainly the Arica y Parinacota, Tarapacá, Antofagasta and Atacama regions have optimum conditions for irrigated crops, but it would be impossible in rainfed conditions. We conclude that chia’s cultivation niche is reduced due to its tropical climate requirements; however, it can be cultivated under irrigation in northern Chile...|$|R
