500|$|Bowlby's {{work was}} misinterpreted {{to mean that}} any {{separation}} from the natural mother, any experience of institutional care or a multiplicity of [...] "mothers" [...] necessarily resulted in severe emotional deprivation and sometimes, that all children undergoing such experiences would develop into [...] "affectionless children". As a consequence it was claimed that only 24-hour care by the same person (the mother) was good enough, day care and nurseries were not good enough and mothers should not go out to work. The WHO advised that day nurseries and creches could have a serious and permanent deleterious effect. Such strictures suited the policies of governments concerned about finding employment for returned and returning servicemen after World War II. In fact, although Bowlby was of the view that proper care could not be provided [...] "by roster", he was also of the view that babies should be accustomed to regular periods of care by another and {{that the key to}} alternative care for working mothers was that it should be regular and continuous. He addressed this point in a 1958 publication called Can I Leave My Baby?. Ainsworth in the WHO 1962 publication also attempted to address this misapprehension by pointing out that the requirement for <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> did not imply an exclusive mother–child pair relationship.|$|E
2500|$|Midwifery-led <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> {{is where}} {{one or more}} {{midwives}} have the primary responsibility for the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> for childbearing women, with a multidisciplinary network of consultation and referral with other health care providers. This is different from [...] "medical-led care" [...] where an obstetrician or family physician is primarily responsible. In [...] "shared-care" [...] models, responsibility may be shared between a midwife, an obstetrician and/or a family physician. The midwife plays a very unique role is part of very intimate situations with the mother. For this reason, many say {{that the most important}} thing to look for in a midwife is comfortability with them, as one will go to them with every question or problem.|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{to gain an}} {{understanding}} of how women conceptualise <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> maternity <b>care.</b> Design: a qualitative study involving in-depth semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis. Setting: a range of urban and rural public hospitals in New South Wales, Australia. Participants: 53 women aged 18 - 44 years (median age 27 years) receiving maternity care in 2011 - 2012. Findings: responses from women suggested five types <b>of</b> continuity: <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> staff, <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> relationship, <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> information, <b>continuity</b> across pregnancies, and continuity across locations. The types <b>of</b> <b>continuity</b> differed by parity and location. Conclusion and implications for practice: <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> maternity <b>care</b> has a variety of meanings to women. If healthcare providers are to commit to providing woman-centred maternity care it is important to recognise the diversity of women’s experiences, and ensure that systems <b>of</b> <b>care</b> are flexible and appropriate to women’s circumstances and needs.

2500|$|Article 12 of the Law of Cohesion {{establishes}} {{the concept of}} [...] "primary care," [...] the basic level of patient care that guarantees the comprehensiveness and <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> throughout the patient's life, acting as manager and coordinator of cases and regulator of issues. Primary care includes health promotion, health education, prevention of illness, health care, maintenance and recuperation of health, {{as well as physical}} rehabilitation and social work.

2500|$|Critical Care Paramedics (CCPs) are paramedics who {{generally}} {{do not respond to}} 9-1-1 emergency calls, with the exception of helicopter [...] "scene" [...] calls. Instead they focus on transferring patients from the hospital they are currently in to other hospitals that can provide a higher level of care. CCPs often work in collaboration with registered nurses and respiratory therapists during hospital transfers. This ensures <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>care.</b> However, when acuity is manageable by a CCP or a registered nurse or respiratory therapist is not available, CCPs will work alone. Providing this care to the patient allows the sending hospital to avoid losing highly trained staff on hospital transfers.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} this study was to {{determine}} if the verbal nursing report provided information necessary to ensure <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> nursing <b>care.</b> The purposes <b>of</b> the study were (1) to determine through observation the information included in the nursing report; (2) to analyze the data to determine if the information given was that which would provide for <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> nursing care; and (3) to provide data which could be used in inservice education as a means <b>of</b> implementing <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> nursing <b>care.</b> A review <b>of</b> the literature was made to obtain a consensus of opinions of authorities in nursing as to what information should be included in the verbal nursing report to facilitate <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> nursing <b>care.</b> The method <b>of</b> study was descriptive-survey, using the technique of structured observation with a check list of twenty-one items as the data-gathering tool. The study was conducted on two medical and two surgical wards of a 320 bed university connected general hospital. Twelve nursing reports were observed, comprising a total population of 243 patients. The data was analyzed by tabulation and categorization and revealed that information concerning the identity and physical aspects of the patient predominated while information concerning the patient 2 ̆ 7 s emotional, spiritual and socio-economic aspects were rarely communicated. All nursing staff reporting for duty were present for report at all observed reports, but their presence was not utilized to give directions or create an opportunity for asking questions. The conclusions reached were that (l) the nursing reports observed did not provide information necessary for <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> nursing <b>care,</b> and (2) the nurses involved in the observed reports were more aware of the physical needs of the patient than needs in other areas of his life. Recommendations made were (l) that a study be made to determine if specific facts or observations which should have been included in the report were omitted, and (2) that a study be made to determine differences in the content of The nursing report between the medical and surgical wards...|$|R
