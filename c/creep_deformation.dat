5|$|Despite {{competition}} from other materials, copper remains the preferred electrical conductor in nearly all categories of electrical wiring except overhead electric power transmission where aluminium is often preferred. Copper wire is used in power generation, power transmission, power distribution, telecommunications, electronics circuitry, and countless types of electrical equipment. Electrical wiring {{is the most important}} market for the copper industry. This includes structural power wiring, power distribution cable, appliance wire, communications cable, automotive wire and cable, and magnet wire. Roughly half of all copper mined is used for electrical wire and cable conductors. Many electrical devices rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties, such as its high electrical conductivity, tensile strength, ductility, <b>creep</b> (<b>deformation)</b> resistance, corrosion resistance, low thermal expansion, high thermal conductivity, ease of soldering, malleability, and ease of installation.|$|E
25|$|The {{temperature}} range in which <b>creep</b> <b>deformation</b> may occur differs in various materials. For example, tungsten requires a {{temperature in the}} thousands of degrees before <b>creep</b> <b>deformation</b> can occur, while ice will creep at temperatures near 0°C (32°F). As a general guideline, the effects of <b>creep</b> <b>deformation</b> generally become noticeable at approximately 35% of the melting point (as measured on a thermodynamic temperature scale such as Kelvin or Rankine) for metals, and at 45% of melting point for ceramics. Virtually any material will creep upon approaching its melting temperature. Since the creep minimum temperature {{is related to the}} melting point, creep can be seen at relatively low temperatures for some materials. Plastics and low-melting-temperature metals, including many solders, can begin to creep at room temperature, as can be seen markedly in old lead hot-water pipes. Glacier flow is an example of creep processes in ice.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} {{tungsten}} light bulb filaments attempts to reduce <b>creep</b> <b>deformation.</b> Sagging of the filament coil between its supports increases with time {{due to the}} weight of the filament itself. If too much deformation occurs, the adjacent turns of the coil touch one another, causing an electrical short and local overheating, which quickly leads to failure of the filament. The coil geometry and supports are therefore designed to limit the stresses caused by {{the weight of the}} filament, and a special tungsten alloy with small amounts of oxygen trapped in the crystallite grain boundaries is used to slow the rate of Coble creep.|$|E

25|$|Refractory metals are a {{class of}} metals that are {{extraordinarily}} resistant to heat and wear. The expression is mostly used {{in the context of}} materials science, metallurgy and engineering. The definition of which elements belong to this group differs. The most common definition includes five elements: two of the fifth period (niobium and molybdenum) and three of the sixth period (tantalum, tungsten, and rhenium). They all share some properties, including a melting point above 2000°C and high hardness at room temperature. They are chemically inert and have a relatively high density. Their high melting points make powder metallurgy the method of choice for fabricating components from these metals. Some of their applications include tools to work metals at high temperatures, wire filaments, casting molds, and chemical reaction vessels in corrosive environments. Partly due to the high melting point, refractory metals are stable against <b>creep</b> <b>deformation</b> to very high temperatures.|$|E
25|$|After {{the planes}} struck the {{buildings}}, {{but before the}} buildings collapsed, the cores of both towers consisted of three distinct sections. Above and below the impact floors, the cores consisted of what were essentially two rigid boxes; the steel in these sections was undamaged and had undergone no significant heating. The section between them, however, had sustained significant damage and, though they were not hot enough to melt it, the fires were weakening the structural steel. As a result, the core columns were slowly being crushed, sustaining plastic and <b>creep</b> <b>deformation</b> from the weight of floors above. As the top section tried to move downward, however, the hat truss redistributed the load to the perimeter columns. Meanwhile, the perimeter columns and floors were also being weakened by {{the heat of the}} fires, and as the floors began to sag they pulled the exterior walls inwards. In the case of 2 WTC, this caused the eastern face to buckle, transferring its loads back to the failing core through the hat truss and initiating the collapse. In the case of 1 WTC, the south wall later buckled in the same way, and with similar consequences.|$|E

The book emphasizes methods of the theory of engineering creep (stress-strain diagrams) and mathematical operations quite distinct from those of solid mechanics absent high-temperature <b>creep</b> <b>deformations,</b> in particular the classical theory of elasticity and structural engineering. Dr. Razdolsky’s previous books focused on methods of computing the ultimate structural design load to the different fire scenarios.

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{experimental research}} {{has been carried out}} to extend the technique of prebended composite beams to VHPC. The main advantage of using VHPC instead of C 55 concrete is to decrease the prestressing losses of the system thanks to a significant decrease of the <b>creep</b> <b>deformations.</b> As one-step was the casting of two 13 m-span beams, it was necessary to use a SCC. Since a risk of cracking at early age due to the transversally restrained shrinkage in the beam was probable and due to the influence of partly restrained longitudinal shrinkage on the composite behavior, the autogenous shrinkage development was examined both under standard isothermal and realistic temperature (same as the beam) conditions. Numerous complementary measurements such as mechanical characterization, creep and shrinkage tests in standard (20 °C, 50 % RH) and variable ambient conditions were performed. The effects of a realistic temperature history on the VHPC autogenous shrinkage are quantified. With the efforts of mix-design optimization it could be demonstrated that the <b>creep</b> <b>deformations</b> of this VHPC were reduced by about a factor 2 in comparison with currently used C 55 concrete, which made the use of prebending significantly more efficient...|$|R

40|$|The <b>creep</b> <b>deformations</b> {{of a body}} under {{mechanical}} load is usually being calculated by an incremental process causing stress redistribution. Creep strains calculated from a given creep law are imposed onto the body in a restraining manner. Although the restraining is corrected for after each time step in order to restore the equilibrium of forces, correction cannot be achieved completely. In the present paper it is shown that the well-known instability problems of Finite-Element creep calculations are caused by residual restraining. A numerical method to impose creep strains without restraints is described and examined. The two methods {{have been used to}} calculate stress relaxation in a thick walled tube under both thermal load and internal as well as external pressure. The results for stress relaxation which in the case of unrestraining creep strains is treated as an independent relaxation process proves to be different for the two methods. In a second application the creep properties of a circumferentially notched bar under uniform tension has been investigated. The calculations show that in the state of stationary creep the minimum cross section retains its diameter, which is a statement depending on the very circumstances chosen.

50|$|With {{increasing}} turbine entry temperature, it {{is important}} to gain a fundamental understanding of the physical phenomena occurring during <b>creep</b> <b>deformation</b> of single crystal superalloys under such extreme condition (i.e. high temperature and high stress). The <b>creep</b> <b>deformation</b> behavior of superalloy single crystal is strongly temperature, stress, orientation and alloy dependent. For a single-crystal superalloy, there are 3 different mode of <b>creep</b> <b>deformation</b> under regimes of different temperature and stress: Rafting, Tertiary and Primary. At low temperature (~750 °C), SX alloys exhibits mostly primary creep behavior. Matan et al. concluded that the extent of primary <b>creep</b> <b>deformation</b> depends strongly on the angle between the tensile axis and the <001>/<011> symmetry boundary. At temperature above 850 °C, tertiary creep dominates and promotes strain softening behavior. When temperature exceeds 1000 °C, the rafting effect is prevalent where cubic particles transform into flat shapes under tensile stress The rafts would also form perpendicular to the tensile axis, since γ phase was transported out of the vertical channels and into the horizontal ones. After conducting unaxial <b>creep</b> <b>deformation</b> of <001> orientated CMSX-4 single crystal superalloy at 1105 °C and 100 MPa, Reed et al. has established that rafting is beneficial to creep life since it delays evolution of creep strain.

AlonsoEvaluating landslide risk and its consequences is hardly achieved by “safety factor” concepts, which essentially rely on static equilibrium concepts and forces. Rather, expected displacements, velocities and accelerations are key magnitudes which help to establish the risk of failure and assist {{in the management of}} its consequences. The paper focuses on three key aspects for landslide initiation and evolution which are difficult to quantify in practice and are also difficult to analyze by current models: the mechanisms of progressive failure in brittle materials, the thermo-mechanical interactions and the <b>creep</b> <b>deformations.</b> Landslides covered in the Lecture are described by kinematically acceptable mechanisms which are eventually explained by the development of shearing bands or sliding surfaces in clays or claystone materials.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{uncertainty}} in calculation modelling. Emphasis {{is put on}} the design state. Design is a chain of decisions under uncertainty. A probabilistic approach is {{used to describe the}} uncertainty and calculations as a way to reveal the uncertainty. Thus, a calculation method becomes an operative tool in a risk analysis, not merely a verification of a prescribed minimum level. The work is a combination of elements from three different academic disciplines; geotechnics, structural mechanics and statistics. Different aspects from two fields of geotechnical modelling are discussed; slope stability as an example of ultimate limit state problems, and interaction ground /superstructure as an example of serviceability limit state problems. For the mathematical solution different algorithms are used; mathematical analysis, point estimate method, Monte-Carlo simulation and reliability analysis. Soil properties are described as random variables. Different uncertainties are accounted for; natural variations, systematic testing errors, random testing errors and errors due to limited testing. Pre-knowledge and test results are combined systematically using Bayesian statistics. Three different levels of complexity of both slope stability analysis and ground/superstructure interaction are given. In both cases, structural models of the soil are given for the third level. For a slope a constant degree of mobilisation is not a prerequisite. Instead the deformation properties of the soil are considered. In the interaction analysis the soil is described as a continuous shear beam on elastic supports. The structural model of the soil can be calibrated against a more rigorous geotechnical model.
