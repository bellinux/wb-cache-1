The {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{development}} of theoretical and technological bases for phosphate raw materials processing. A critical analysis of the current state and prospects for the development of phosphorous technologies was conducted and reserves of phosphate-containing raw materials have been characterized. The classifications of Ukrainian phosphate deposits by chemical composition, properties and kind are presented. It is proved that such phosphorites can not be processed by traditional extraction and electrothermal methods and new technologies are needed for their processing. Theoretical regularities and quantitative dependences of tricalcium phosphate reduction in the presence of calcium carbonate impurities are obtained. It was found that increase of CaCO 3 content in phosphorite reduces the rate of phosphorus distillation and its quantity, and the process mostly stops at a ratio of P 2 O 5 : CaO = 1 : 6. The reduction of Ca 3 (PO 4) 2 occurs in the diffusion region and is limited by internal diffusion. The reasons of phosphorus distillation deceleration in the presence of calcium carbonate impurities were identified and the thermodynamic parameters of highly-coordinated calcium-containing phosphates (tetra-, penta- and hexaphosphate) were determined. This made it possible to optimize the technological parameters of phosphate raw materials processing. The author has defined that the chlorine impurities introduction to natural gas reduces the temperature range of the reduction process to 600 - 1000 ?K and conduce to highly reactive hydrocarbon radicals formation and the process transformation to the chain mechanism. It was proved that the stechiometric flow rate and the temperature regime of 623 - 823 ?K are rational parameters of phosphorus distillation from phosphorites by <b>carbonyl</b> <b>chlorides.</b> Carrying out the process at lower temperatures leads to phosphorus condensation in the chimneys and solid phase. At the temperatures above 873 K, thermal decomposition of <b>carbonyl</b> <b>chlorides</b> occurs and the process is transformed from exchangeable to reducible. When transferring tetrachloromethane to the gas medium, the process occurs in a stechiometric ratio and the reaction rate is determined by the rate of tetrachloromethane transferring to phosphate surface and can be increased with the the hydrodynamic regime change. The principal technological scheme of the existing electrothermal method of phosphorus production has been improved. This is based on the use of existing carbon monoxide to produce phosgene and to distillate phosphorus oxychloride from phosphate raw materials. A technological process for processing high-carbon off-balance phosphorites from deposit in Nezvysko using phosphorus distillation with carbon tetrachloride was proposed and developed. The technical and economic calculations show the technical efficiency and economic feasibility of the developed technology of phosphate ores processing for further use in phosphoric acid and phosphorus oxychloride production. ???????? ????????????? ?????????????? ? ?????????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ????????????????? ? ??????????? ???????? ????????? ???????. ???????????, ??? ?????????? ??????????

Although synthetic cluster glycosides are constituted on scaffolds to achieve high avidities in lectin binding, {{there have been no}} known attempts to modulate the orientations of the sugar clusters {{with the aid of a}} functional scaffold onto which the sugar units are linked. Herein, we describe synthesis, physical, and lectin-binding studies of a series of α -D-mannopyranoside and β -D-galactopyranosyl-(1 → 4) - β -D-glucopyranoside glycoclusters that are attached to a photoswitchable azobenzenoid core. These glycoclusters were synthesized by the amidation of amine-tethered glycopyranosides with azobenzene <b>carbonyl</b> <b>chlorides.</b> From kinetic studies, the cis forms of the azobenzene-glycopyranoside derivative were found to be more stable in aqueous solutions than in organic solvents. Molecular modeling studies were performed to estimate the relative geometries of the photoswitchable glycoclusters in the trans- and cis-isomeric forms. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was employed to assess the binding of these glycoclusters to lectins peanut agglutinin (PNA) and concanavalin A (Con A). Although binding affinities were enhanced several orders higher as the valency of the sugar was increased, a biphasic-binding profile in ITC plots was observed during few glycoclusters lectin-binding processes. The biphasic-binding profile indicates a "cooperativity" in the binding process. An important outcome of this study is that in addition to inherent clustering of the sugar units as a molecular feature, an induced clustering emanates because of the isomerization of the trans form of the azobenzene scaffold to the cis-isomeric form...|$|R

Herein we report an efficient tandem polymerization of alkynes, <b>carbonyl</b> <b>chlorides</b> and primary amines to afford regio- and stereoregular conjugated poly(enaminone) s. The atom-economical one-pot sequential polycoupling–hydroamination polymerization catalyzed by Pd(PPh 3) 2 Cl 2 /CuI proceeded smoothly under mild conditions, furnishing nitrogensubstituted conjugated polymers with high molecular weights (up to 46 100) and high regio-/stereoregularities (100 %) in nearly quantitative yields (up to 99 %). The single crystal structure of the model compound, together with the NMR spectra comparison of the model compound and polymers provided direct insight into the stereo selectivity of the polymerization, verifying the sole Z-vinyleneisomer of the polymers. Through the exquisite structural design strategy of the intramolecular hydrogen bond of the resulting hydroamination product, the tautomerization between enamine and imine as well as E/Z isomerization was successfully avoided, providing products with high chemical stability and sole Z-vinylene isomers. The conjugated polymers display excellent solubility in common organic solvents, good film forming ability, and high thermal stability. The hydrogen bond formation of the polymer helps to block the potential photo-induced electron transfer process and the polymer shows a unique aggregation enhanced emission phenomenon: their solutions are weakly emissive, while their nanoaggregates or thin films are brightly emissive. Furthermore, thin films of the polymers enjoy high refractive indices (1. 9103 – 1. 6582) in a wide wavelength region of 400 – 1000 nm, which can be further modulated by UV irradiation. Meanwhile, well-resolved fluorescent photopatterns of the polymers can be fabricated through the UV irradiation of thin films via a copper photomask...|$|R

40|$|Different facile {{and robust}} {{strategies}} were employed for {{the synthesis of}} surfactants with desired properties. Several cost effective protocols with reduced number of steps were applied for the efficient synthesis of biodegradable and environmentally friendly novel thiourea-based surfactants. Forty novel non-ionic and cationic surfactants containing thiourea functionality were synthesized from <b>carbonyl</b> <b>chlorides,</b> potassium thiocyanate, amines and bromoethane with high yield. The structures were characterized by 1 H-NMR, 13 CNMR, FTIR and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The electrochemical fate of the synthesized surfactants was studied by using cyclic, square wave and differential pulse voltammetry over a wide pH range. All the surfactants were found to oxidize and reduce in a pH dependent diffusion controlled manner. The pH dependent proton coupled electron transfer redox mechanistic pathways of the surfactants were proposed and the voltammetric results revealed the redox behavior to modulate by changing the substituent at the hydrophobic tail of the surfactants. Sensitive pulse voltammetric method was developed {{for the detection of}} very small amounts of the surfactants with high accuracy and precision. UV-visible spectrophotometry and tensiometry were used to evaluate the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the synthesized surfactants in ethanol, water-ethanol and water-methanol mixture. The CMC values of surfactants determined by both methods were found in very good agreement. The critical micelle concentration varied with change in ratios of solvent mixture due to variation in polarity and corresponding alteration in solute-solvent interaction. The mixing of another solvent or co-solvent also altered the CMC of surfactant solution by a mechanism involving the penetration of co-solvent into the micellar core of surfactant solution. The synthesized surfactants were also studied by UV-visible spectroscopy in different pH media and some interesting spectral characteristics like color variation, prominent change in the location of peak position, drastic variation in absorption intensity and merging of two signals into a single peak were observed and interpreted. The pH dependent UV visible spectra of various surfactants also showed the appearance of two isosbestic points due to the existence of these surfactants in keto-thiol and enol-thiol tautomeric forms. The excellent complexation ability of surfactants was used for the removal of toxic metal ions such as copper, mercury and manganese ions from different aqueous systems. The appearance of new peaks and change in color of metal ions solution in the presence of surfactants offered evidence about surfactant-metal ion complexation.

However, it appears to be related by a series of facile reactions, involving dissociation of SnCl(_ 3) (^-) - and CO groups, to several other 4 and 5 -coordinate Rh(I) -CO-SnCl(- 3) complexes. [Rh(CO) (SnCl(_ 3)) (_ 4) ](^ 3 -), [Rh(CO) (SnCl(_ 3)) (_ 2) Cl](^ 2 -), and [Rh(CO) (_ 2) (SnCl(_ 3)) X](^-) (X = Cl(^-) or SnCl(_ 3) (^-)) have been isolated from solution, often as mixtures along with [Rh(CO) (_ 2) (SnCl(_ 3)) (_ 3) ](^ 2 -). Spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic data indicated that SnCl(_ 3) (^-) - is a significant π- tacceptor ligand, thus explaining its ability to form 5 -coordinate 18 -electron rhodium(I) complexes. The effect of tin(II) chloride on the rhodium-chloride catalytic reaction is attributed to changes in π-acceptor and trans effect properties when SnC 1 (_ 3) (^-) - replaces chloride ligand(s). High pressure infra-red studies are consistent with both [Rh(CO) (_ 2) Cl(_ 2) ](^-) and a Rh(I) CO- SnCl(_ 3) complex being catalytically active in a rhodium-tin-chloride system, and the carbonyl absorptions observed are consistent with [Rh(CO) (SnCl(_ 3)) (_ 4) ](^ 3 -), [Rh(C 0 h(SnC(_ 3)) (_ 3) ](^ 2 -) and [Rh(CO) (SnCl(_ 3)) (_ 2) Cl](^ 2 -) as catalytic precursors. The general predominance of [Rh(CO) (_ 2) (SnC 1 (_ 3)) (_ 3) ](^ 2 -) in solution at atmospheric pressure and room temperature, suggests that it may be the favoured catalytic precursor, undergoing conversion to a catalytically active 16 -electron Rh(I) -SnC 1 (_ 3) complex such as [Rh(CO) (_ 2) (SnCl(_ 3)) X]- (X = Cl(^-) SnCl(_ 3) (^-)) via dissociation of SnCl(_ 3) -...|$|R
40|$|Magister Scientiae - MSc (Chemistry) Reactions of furan, {{thiophene}} and alkyl <b>carbonyl</b> <b>chlorides</b> with Unsubstituted and substituted pyrazoles {{produced the}} desired pyrazolyl ligands, [R 2 pyrazole-CO-R/] (R= H, Me, tBu, Ph, R/ = furan, thiophene, Me or tBu) in good yields. The reaction of these synthons with Pd(NCMe) 2 Cl 2 as the metal precursor afforded the respective palladium(II) complexes in moderate to high yields. All compounds synthesised were characterised {{by a combination}} of 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and IR spectroscopic techniques for structure elucidation. Microanalyses were performed to confirm the purity of the compounds. Single crystal X-ray crystallography of complexes bis{ 2 -(3, 5 -dimethylpyraz olyl- 1 -carbonyl) furan}PdCl 2, 1, and bis{ 2 -(3, 5 -dimethylpyrazolyl- 1 -carbonyl) thiophene} PdCl 2, 2, was performed to determine the molecular structures of the compounds. The two structures show that the complexes formed are mononuclear. The ligands exhibit monodentate coordination with trans-geometry being favoured in the square planar complexes. Activation of some of the complexes, 1 - 4, with the methylaluminoxane (MAO) produced active catalysts for ethylene polymerisation at elevated temperatures giving high-density linear polyethylene. The optimum Al:Pd ratio was found to be 5000 : 1. The nature of the substituent on the pyrazolyl moiety affects the activity of these catalysts in ethylene polymerisation. In general, increase in steric bulk resulted in decreased catalytic activity and low molecular weight polyethylene. The use of the Lewis acid, B(C 6 F 5) 3, with catalyst 2 resulted in enhanced catalytic activity towards ethylene polymerisation. When ethylaluminium dichloride, EtAlCl 2, was used as the co-catalyst, these catalyst systems were found to be active towards ethylene oligomerisation producing mostly C 10 and C 12 oligomers. An optimum Al:Pd ratio of 1000 : in the catalytic activity of catalyst 2 was observed. The nature of the alkyl substituent on the pyrazolyl system also shows significant influence in the oligomerisation process. The activity of the catalysts as well as the nature of the oligomers produced greatly depends on the oligomerisation conditions. For example, increase in both temperature and pressure resulted on significant increase in turnover number of catalyst 1 and 2. Longer reaction times resulted in drastic drop in the catalytic activity of the complexes. When acetic acid was reacted with the appropriate pyrazole {{in the presence of a}} phase transfer catalyst, the bidentate bis-pyrazolyl acetic acid ligands, {(pyrazole) 2 CHCO 2 H}, L 14, {(Me 2 pyrazole) 2 CHCO 2 H, L 15, and {(tBu 2 pyrazole) 2 CHCO 2 H} L 16 were obtained in good yields. The reaction of these ligands with Pd(NCMe) 2 Cl 2 in a 1 : 1 ratio afforded the corresponding yellow complexes, Pd(L 14) Cl 2, 9, Pd(L 15) Cl 2, 10, and Pd(L 16) Cl 2, 11, in moderate yields. 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and IR spectroscopy have been used to characterise these compounds. Microanalysis confirmed the purity and empirical formulae of the complexes. Reaction of L 14 with ethanol under acidic conditions produced the respective ester, bis(pyrazol- 1 -yl) ethyl acetate, (L 17) in good yield. The acid dissociation constants of the ligands and their palladium(II) complexes have been determined by titration using dilute NaOH. Ka values within the range of 1. 8 × 10 - 4 to 1. 75 × 10 - 2 were obtained. Acidity was found to decrease with increase in the electron donor ability of the alkyl pyrazolyl substituents. In general, the palladium(II) complexes were more acidic than their corresponding ligands. South Afric...|$|R

Complexes 3 and 4 are fluxional in solution, and at low temperatures exist predominantly {{with one of}} the two keto groups coordinated. Complexes 3 and 4 undergo metal-promoted hydrolysis reactions with adventitious water leading to the diphosphoxane-bridged dimers [RhCl(CO) (mu-PR 2 OPR 2) ](2) (5, R = Ph; 6, R = NC 4 H 4), with the <b>carbonyl</b> and <b>chloride</b> ligands both terminal and semi-bridging in 5 but solely terminal in 6. Complexes 3 and 4 react with NH 4 PF 6 or TlPF 6 to give cis-[Rh(L-kappa(2) P,O) (2) ] PF 6 (7 b, L = L- 1; 8, L = L- 2). These complexes are also formed from the {{reaction of}} L with [Rh(mu-Cl) (cod) ](2) in the presence of NH 4 PF 6. Complex 8 reacts with CO to give [Rh(CO) (L- 2) (2) ] PF 6 9, with PMe 3 to give [Rh(PMe 3) (2) (L- 2 -kappa(2) P, O) ] PF 6 10, and with [NEt(3) Bz] Cl (Bz = CH 2 Ph) to give [RhCl(L- 2 -kappa(1) P) (L- 2 -kappa(2) P, O) ] 11.
