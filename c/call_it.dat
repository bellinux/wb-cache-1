5|$|At the time, some Muslim Indian leaders {{feared that}} Muslims were losing their {{religious}} identity {{to the majority}} Hindu culture. The movement was never given any name officially, but Ilyas used to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> Tahrik-i Imaan.|$|E
5|$|Consciously or unconsciously, most theists see in {{gods and}} devils, heaven and hell, reward and punishment, a whip to lash the people into obedience, meekness and contentment.... The {{philosophy}} of Atheism expresses the expansion {{and growth of}} the human mind. The philosophy of theism, if we can <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a philosophy, is static and fixed.|$|E
2500|$|Rav Awira (or {{some say}} Rabbi Joshua ben Levi) taught that the Evil Inclination (yetzer hara) has seven names. God <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "Evil" [...] in [...] saying, [...] "the {{imagination}} of man's heart is evil from his youth." [...] Moses <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "the Uncircumcised" [...] in [...] saying, [...] "Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart."

5000|$|A Piece of Strange {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics, with XXL <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> [...] "soulful", [...] "raw", and [...] "sophisticated", URB <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> [...] "a {{piece of}} beauty", Scratch <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> [...] "top-shelf", CMJ <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> a [...] "beautiful...dense opera", and The A.V. Club <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> [...] "vast and ambitious". Since its release in 2006, the album {{has been mentioned}} {{as one of the}} most important underground hip hop albums and portraying a narrative not visited in any previous hip hop album.|$|R
5|$|The Forgotten Realms, {{the high}} fantasy {{campaign}} {{setting in which}} Baldur's Gate II is set, is a fictional world similar to a medieval Earth, but with its own peoples, geography, and history. In the Realms, as its inhabitants <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> fantastic creatures and magic are common.|$|E
5|$|The red panda's local names {{differ from}} place to place. The Lepcha people <b>call</b> <b>it</b> sak nam. In Nepal, the species is called bhalu biralo (bear-cat) and habre. The Sherpa people of Nepal and Sikkim <b>call</b> <b>it</b> ye niglva ponva and wah donka. The word wậː is Sunuwari meaning bear; in Tamang language, a small, red bear is called tāwām. In the Kanchenjunga region of eastern Nepal, the Limbus know red pandas as kaala, which {{literally}} means dark because of their underside pelage; villagers of Tibetan origin call them hoptongar.|$|E
5|$|The tritone, an {{interval}} spanning three whole tones—such as C to F#—was a forbidden dissonance in medieval ecclesiastical singing, which led monks to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> diabolus in musica—"the devil in music".|$|E

5000|$|The name [...] "Tioga" [...] is {{borrowed}} from Native American tribes {{who lived in}} the area {{at the time of the}} arrival of European colonists; it means [...] "at the forks". The various Iroquois tribes all had similar words for the concept: the Oneida <b>called</b> <b>it</b> Te-ah-o-ge, the Mohawk <b>called</b> <b>it</b> Te-yo-ge-ga, the Cayuga <b>called</b> <b>it</b> Da-o-ga and the Seneca <b>called</b> <b>it</b> Da-yo-o-geh.|$|R
5|$|You’ll see us {{all again}} under {{different}} musical guises but, these 3 shows will be Fight Like Apes’ last. We want to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a day while we’re all still pals and {{are proud of}} what we’ve done.|$|E
5|$|A softer {{and more}} tuneful musical call {{has been called}} the toy-trumpet <b>call.</b> <b>It</b> has been {{reported}} to foretell rainy weather. The loud bell call resembles the clinking call, and is a clear piping sound. Females and young make an insistent repetitive squawking when begging for food from a parent or mate, similar to the begging call of the Australian magpie, and make a gobbling sound when fed.|$|E
5|$|Exceptions {{to these}} naming {{patterns}} {{are found in}} languages that designate the move by making reference to a location, such as the Norwegian brassespark (Brazilian kick). This exception is most significant in Spanish, where a fierce controversy exists between Chile and Peru—as part of their historic sports rivalry—over the naming of the bicycle kick; Chileans know it as the chilenita, while Peruvians <b>call</b> <b>it</b> the chalaca. Regardless, the move is also known in Spanish by the less tendentious names of tijera and tijereta—both {{a reference to the}} manoeuvre's scissor-like motion.|$|E
5000|$|In late 2015, Moore created popular blog Male Feminists of Tinder [...] {{which was}} {{immediately}} praised by numerous outlets, including New York Magazine who <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "brilliant...a perfect snapshot of a particular, awkward moment in culture and technology," [...] Paper Magazine <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "the best Tumblr ever", BuzzFeed <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "a gift," [...] and Cosmopolitan <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "hilarious...drop-dead funny." ...|$|R

40|$|Foucault <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> (after Bataille) a limit-experience, or {{the thought}} from outside. Lyotard <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> a differend, whilst for Kristeva {{it is the}} semiotic, or the abject. Derrida <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> many things: différance, trace, pharmakon, hymen, supplement, and gram. Sue Golding <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> a kind of dirty, bloody poetics, one which insists on, say, bodies and skin and smells and {{imagination}} {{in the face of}} it all...|$|R
5|$|In August 1918, a more {{virulent strain}} {{appeared}} simultaneously in Brest, France; in Freetown, Sierra Leone; {{and in the}} U.S. in Boston, Massachusetts. The Spanish flu also spread through Ireland, carried there by returning Irish soldiers. The Allies of World War I came to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> the Spanish flu, primarily because the pandemic received greater press attention after it moved from France to Spain in November 1918. Spain {{was not involved in}} the war and had not imposed wartime censorship.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} {{about the film}} on his website, Anderson discussed problems he encountered in naming his film Fuck instead of a censored version of the word. Anderson always wanted to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> Fuck, because it succinctly described the film's contents. There were inherent problems with this approach, including an inability to advertise the true title in mainstream media such as The New York Times and Los Angeles Times (they used four asterisks instead), although the real title might be permitted in alternative newspapers such as LA Weekly. Anderson also anticipated problems displaying the film's title during film festivals on theatre marquees.|$|E
5|$|It is {{revealed}} that after their kiss, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) confirmed to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) her {{intention to marry}} Roy Anderson (David Denman). However, {{a few days before}} the wedding, Pam got cold feet and decided to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> off. She moved into her own apartment and began taking art classes. Pam's rejection sent Roy into a downward spiral, hitting rock bottom with a drunk driving arrest. When being interviewed by the camera crew, Roy makes a vow to win Pam back.|$|E
5000|$|Brendan Kelly of Variety <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "an {{efficient}} psychological thriller" [...] that [...] "becomes a tad predictable". [...] Nathan Rabin of The A.V.

[...] TV Guide rated it 2/4 {{stars and}} <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "a sometimes gripping, sometimes frustrating suspense drama". [...] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "relentlessly obvious and tedious".|$|R
5000|$|Jonathan Rosenbaum <b>called</b> <b>it</b> Mizoguchi's {{greatest}} {{film and}} praised his [...] "refusal to use close-ups…the theme of female sacrifice that informs {{most of his}} major works is given a singular resonance and complexity here." [...] Derek Adams of Time Out <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "a heartbreaker to end them all" [...] and praised its cinematography. Richard Brody <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "one of the cinema’s great outpourings of imaginative energy." [...] Noel Burch <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "one of his most deeply ‘feminist’ films" [...] and Tony Rayns <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "the peak of Mizoguchi's art." ...|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times <b>called</b> <b>it</b> a [...] "glum, curiously flat thriller"; Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "more preposterous than thrilling"; and Russell Smith of the Austin Chronicle <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "1997's most tedious movie".|$|R
5|$|On 12 April 1849, in Naples, Italy, {{astronomer}} Annibale de Gasparis (age 29) discovered Hygiea. It was {{the first}} of his nine asteroid discoveries. The director of the Naples observatory, Ernesto Capocci, named the asteroid. He chose to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> Igea Borbonica ("Bourbon Hygieia") in honor of the ruling family of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies where Naples was located.|$|E
5|$|Ruby, {{the company}} manager, sends Larry and Jeannie {{down to the}} stage to {{continue}} the play. After Bob and Mac recover, Ruby informs Bob that Larry and Jeanie had secretly married earlier that day, and the surprised electrician leaves. Mac, fearful of more mayhem, goes in search of him. As Mac exits, the phone rings, and Ruby takes the <b>call.</b> <b>It</b> is the producer, calling for Mac to transfer him to another show, thereby setting him free to resume his romance with Betty.|$|E
5|$|The National Rail {{station is}} officially named London Paddington, a name {{commonly}} used outside London but rarely by Londoners, who <b>call</b> <b>it</b> just Paddington, {{as on the}} London Underground map. This same practice applies to all the London mainline rail termini, except London Bridge. Parts of the station, including the main train shed, date from 1854, when it was built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel as the London terminus for the Great Western Railway (GWR). It is one of nineteen stations managed by Network Rail.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Melfi {{calls the}} home that Tony put {{his mother in}} a [...] "retirement community" [...] and Tony corrects her and <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> a nursing home. Before this, {{whenever}} somebody <b>called</b> <b>it</b> a nursing home, Tony always corrected them and <b>called</b> <b>it</b> a retirement community.|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "too long" [...] in a {{negative}} review (2.5/4). Christopher Null <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "insanely over-rated" [...] and gave it 2/5 stars ("weak"). Entertainment Weekly's Owen Glieberman <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "too ambitious" [...] and said it [...] "never finds a mood" ...|$|R
5000|$|Derek Elley of Variety <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "unevenly acted and scripted". [...] Jamie Russell of the BBC rated it 3/5 {{stars and}} <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "commendably ambitious, but only {{occasionally}} successful". [...] Alan Morrison of Empire rated it 3/5 stars and {{wrote that the}} film becomes more pretentious as time goes on. [...] Total Film rated it 2/5 stars and <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "intense, reflective yarn" [...] that wallows in sadism. [...] Time Out London <b>called</b> <b>it</b> bleak, stylistically bold, and occasionally pretentious. [...] David Johnson of DVD Verdict <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "a refreshingly original take on the hitman-with-a-conscience gig." [...] Glenn Erickson of DVD Talk <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "an overachieving straight-to-video feature" [...] that treats its subject matter as more important than it is.|$|R
5|$|The Przewalski's horse (Equus ferus przewalskii), {{named after}} the Russian {{explorer}} Nikolai Przhevalsky, is a rare Asian animal. It {{is also known as}} the Mongolian wild horse; Mongolian people know it as the taki, and the Kyrgyz people <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a kirtag. The subspecies was presumed extinct in the wild between 1969 and 1992, while a small breeding population survived in zoos around the world. In 1992, it was reestablished in the wild due to the conservation efforts of numerous zoos. Today, a small wild breeding population exists in Mongolia. There are additional animals still maintained at zoos throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|The hoot is a short, soft {{call and}} is {{another form of}} contact <b>call.</b> <b>It</b> is a more {{intimate}} call than the wail and is used exclusively between small family groups or flocks. The common loon hoots to let other family or flock members know where it is. This call is often heard when the adult loon is summoning its chicks to feed.|$|E
5|$|The long-awaited {{excavation}} {{began on}} 29 September 2004, {{led by a}} handful of archaeologists and dedicated archaeology volunteers called Southeast Asian Archaeology. Nearly 2 metres down, the volunteers uncovered significant remains of the fort still in situ—a pair of infantry bastions that did not appear in the original plans, the perimeter of the moat's inner escarpment and {{what appears to be the}} drawbridge superstructure. Experts <b>call</b> <b>it</b> Singapore's only 'true fort'—one with protection all around—and it was considered one of Singapore's most important archaeological finds.|$|E
5000|$|Slate <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "a cheerfully sicko social commentary". Los Angeles Times <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "deep, {{dark and}} funny".|$|R
25|$|Initially {{thinking}} {{it to be}} related to the South American sloths, Shaw and Nodder in 1791 called the species Bradypus ursinus, noting that it was bear-like, but giving weight to the long claws and the absence of upper middle incisors. Meyer (1793) identified it as a bear and <b>called</b> <b>it</b> Melursus lybius, and in 1817, de Blainville <b>called</b> <b>it</b> Ursus labiatus because of the long lips. Iliger <b>called</b> <b>it</b> Prochilus hirsutus, the Greek genus name indicating long lips, while the specific name noted its long and coarse hair. Fischer <b>called</b> <b>it</b> Chondrorhynchus hirsutus, while Tiedemann <b>called</b> <b>it</b> Ursus longirostris.|$|R
