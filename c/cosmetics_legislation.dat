This applies particularly to [...] "adverse effects" [...] and [...] "serious adverse effects". The European legislation defines [...] "adverse effect" [...] as {{a negative impact on}} human health, which is attributable to the normal or reasonably foreseeable use of a cosmetic product.

40|$|The European <b>cosmetics</b> <b>legislation</b> {{foresees}} {{a review}} in 2011 and possible postponement of the 2013 marketing ban {{to enforce the}} testing ban for systemic and repeated-dose animal tests. For this purpose, a 119 -page report commissioned by the European Commission was published recently. Here, a group of 17 independent experts from the US, Europe, and Japan was brought together to evaluate the report. The expert panel strongly endorsed the report and its conclusions. A number of important options not considered were identified; these do not, however, affect the overall conclusions regarding the current lack of availability of a full replacement, especially for the areas of repeated dose toxicity, carcinogenicity testing, and reproductive toxicity, though a roadmap for change is emerging. However, some of these options may provide adequate data for replacement of some animal studies {{in the near future}} pending validation. Various recommendations expand the original report. The reviewers agree with the report that there is greater promise in the short term for the areas of sensitization and toxicokinetics. Additional opportunities lie in more global collaborations and the inclusion of other industry sectors...|$|E
40|$|Starting {{with the}} animal welfare Directive from 1986 and {{continuing}} until most recent chemicals and <b>cosmetics</b> <b>legislation,</b> Europe has laid {{the ground for}} the implementation of alternative methods. In order to meet these political expectations, a couple of technical and strategic developments became necessary: - An analysis of current in vivo test performance to set benchmarks for alternatives - An analysis of the frequency (prevalence) of toxic health effects in different areas of test application - An inventory and database of the alternative methods available - A coached development of lacking tests also making use of novel technologies - An acceleration and international harmonisation of the validation process and regulatory implementation - A development of quality assurance systems for in vitro methods such as Good Laboratory Practice and Good Cell Culture Practice - A transition from single tests as stand-alone replacements to the composition of test strategies and their validation. The European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) has played a proactive role in all these processes co-ordinating many stakeholder activities. A review of the state of these developments shall be given, in order to show how a new type of evidence-based toxicology is emerging which is based on validated and quality controlled test strategies.

Differences in regulatory frameworks imposed barrier in innovations and reduces market size of cosmetic product, which led to significant economic loss. This paper enlightened about the barriers for harmonisation, current activities to encourage harmonisation, role of organisations and measures to be taken for it. Once the process of harmonisation is complete, this could bring significant benefits for innovation by increasing {{the size of the}} market for global products. So from the point of economic growth and consumers benefits there is a dire need of harmonisation of cosmetic <b>legislation.</b> <b>cosmetics</b> legislation; harmonisation; innovation; regulatory frameworks; economic growth; cultural differences; culture; cosmetic products; consumer benefits. ...|$|R
40|$|The Italian herbal {{products}} {{market is}} the most prosperous in Europe. The proof {{is represented by the}} use of these products in several marketing categories, ranging from medicine to nutrition and <b>cosmetics.</b> Market and <b>legislation</b> in Italy are at the same time cause and consequence of this peculiar situation. In fact, the legislation on botanical food supplements in Italy is very permissive {{and at the same time}} the market shows an overall satisfaction of users and strong feedback in terms of consumption, which brings a widening use of medicinal plants, formerly the prerogative of pharmaceuticals, to other fields such as nutrition. This review summarizes the market and normative panorama of herbal products in Italy, highlighting the blurred boundaries of health indications, marketing authorizations and quality controls between herbal medicines and non pharmaceutical products, such as food supplements, cosmetics and other herbal-based “parapharmaceuticals”...|$|R
40|$|The enzymatic {{cleavage}} of {{azo dyes}} is a metabolic ability, common among bacteria strains {{isolated from the}} human skin microflora. Using the described in-vitro model, release of primary aromatic amines was detected, both from mono and diazo compounds, water-soluble and water-insoluble azo dyes. According {{to the results of}} this investigation, the use of at least 3 of the 4 azo dyes currently approved for use in <b>cosmetics</b> under German <b>legislation</b> should be reconsidered, as they have been demonstrated to release, by enzymatic cleavage, aromatic amines, which are suspected to be carcinogenic. A large number of azo dyes is already prohibited to be used in textiles or leather intended for prolonged contact with human skin. Clothing and similar products containing these dyes may no longer be marketed under European and German legislation. Our results confirm that this prohibition of use as well as the continued investigations to monitor and thereby enforce compliance with this legislation are necessary. In general, reductive cleavage of azo dyes may already occur under aerobic conditions. Under anaerobic conditions, this reaction is significantly accelerated. For some of the dyes tested, cleavage products were only detectible under anaerobic conditions. The in vitro model, developed by Platzek and Lang and optimised during this work, is able to produce quantitative results with high intra-day reproducibility. Using the current experimental set-up, inter-day reproducibility of the quantitative results could not be achieved due to the complexity of biological systems and the variety of parameters that influence the amount of amine released by reductive cleavage. However, working with assays from an identical population of bacteria, it is possible to systematically vary certain parameters and thereby, study their influence on the reductive azo cleavage. Within the lower range of concentration, there is a linear correlation between the concentration of the dye and the amount of amine released. Above a certain concentration, however, saturation of the enzyme is achieved and further increase of the dye concentration does not result in an accelerated release of amine. Under anaerobic conditions {{and as long as the}} enzyme was saturated with substrate (azo dye), there was a linear correlation between the number of bacteria in the assay and the amount of released amine. When the concentration of dye was decreased below the level of saturation, the release of amine was decelerated. In some cases, ongoing release and further metabolic reactions of the amine compensated each other, resulting in a steady-state. The kinetics of amine release are dependent upon the concentration of dye (substrate), the presence or absence of oxygen and possibility of further metabolisation of the amine. Under aerobic conditions, cases of amine release, following zero order kinetics were demonstrated. Under anaerobic condition and when a sufficient amount of azo dye was present, the release of amine was often accelerated over the course of continued incubation. In contrast, a significant decrease of dye concentration did result in a decelerated amine release. However, a decrease of amine concentration in the assay was only observed when the particular amine was sensitive to further metabolic reactions such as oxidation of 2, 4 -diaminotoluene or reductive cleavage of 4 -aminoazobenzene. The in-vitro model may be used as a worst case experiment with further azo dyes, including dyes isolated from consumer products, to investigate whether or not these particular dyes may release aromatic amines, i. e. suspected carcinogens, by reductive cleavage. There are two promising approaches to continue the research on reductive cleavage by skin bacteria. The strains which have been used in this in vitro model could be grown on artificial skin or samples of animal skin and thereby, integrated into a resorption model in order to learn more about the cleavage of azo dyes and subsequent resorption of aromatic amines under in vivo conditions. Furthermore, the enzyme or enzymes responsible for reductive azo cleavage of should be isolated. Experiments with the isolated enzyme are likely to yield more reproducible data on the kinetics of azo cleavage. Moreover, the enzyme?s structure, structure-activity-relationships and the physiological role of the enzyme could then be studied...|$|R
