5|$|The Konjaku Monogatarishū, a {{collection}} of stories published in the late Heian period, contains {{some of the earliest}} tales of tengu, already characterized as they would be for centuries to come. These tengu are the troublesome opponents of Buddhism, who mislead the pious with false images of the Buddha, <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> monks and drop them in remote places, possess women in an attempt to seduce holy men, rob temples, and endow those who worship them with unholy power. They often disguise themselves as priests or nuns, but their true form seems to be that of a kite.|$|E
5|$|The women {{worked from}} 8:30a.m. to 3:30p.m. daily – not long hours – but the working {{conditions}} were probably unbearable by modern standards. New Orleans has a warm, wet climate. The process of adjusting, however, required the utmost {{attention to the}} scales' balance, and the slightest draft could upset it. The draft could also <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> the silver dust from the coin planchets the women would file. For these reasons the windows and doors were almost always kept shut, resulting in a very hot working environment. Workers relied on water coolers to provide relief {{from the heat and}} avoid dehydration. The women mint employees were judged to enjoy better working conditions than many other American women workers in the late nineteenth century.|$|E
5|$|A single {{spotted hyena}} can eat at least 14.5kg of meat per meal. Although spotted hyenas act aggressively {{toward each other}} when feeding, they {{compete with each other}} mostly through speed of eating, rather than by {{fighting}} as lions do. When feeding on an intact carcass, spotted hyenas will first consume the meat around the loins and anal region, then open the abdominal cavity and pull out the soft organs. Once the stomach, its wall and contents are consumed, the hyenas will eat the lungs and abdominal and leg muscles. Once the muscles have been eaten, the carcass is disassembled and the hyenas <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> pieces to eat in peace. Spotted hyenas are adept at eating their prey in water: they have been observed to dive under floating carcasses to take bites, then resurface to swallow. A single hyena can take less than two minutes in eating a gazelle fawn, while a group of 35 hyenas can completely consume an adult zebra in 36 minutes. Spotted hyenas do not require much water, and typically only spend 30 seconds drinking.|$|E

5|$|Rowley's first co-ordinated {{action was}} {{prompted}} by the return of Caroline with her prizes. Sheltering under the guns of Saint-Paul harbour, Caroline made an inviting target for an expeditionary force from Rodriguez in practice for the anticipated invasion of the whole island. On 21 September, a force of over 600 soldiers, sailors and Royal Marines under Keating and Willoughby landed on Île Bonaparte and marched around the town's seaward fortifications, storming them from the rear at first light. Capturing each in succession and routing opposition from French militia, the force secured the gun batteries overlooking the port, allowing Rowley to bring his squadron directly into the harbour and bombard the shipping anchored within. The French naval officers, outnumbered and unsupported, drove their ships on shore and abandoned them, allowing the British to seize and <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> Caroline, the two captured East Indiamen {{and a number of}} smaller vessels. French attempts to recapture the town were undermined by the failure of the island's commander, General Nicolas Des Bruslys, to engage the British with his main force. Des Bruslys later committed suicide. With the garrison leaderless, a truce was agreed that granted the British five days in control of the town. In this time they were able to remove all government supplies and demolish the town's government buildings. Rowley and his force eventually departed from Saint-Paul on 28 September. As a reward for their services, Willoughby was promoted to command Nereide and Corbet sent back to Britain in Caroline, renamed HMS Bourbonaise.|$|E

25|$|The {{shaft of}} the central cross is covered in small lumps {{as was the case}} with all votive crosses erected to {{celebrate}} the end of an outbreak of the plague. These are thought by some architectural historians to mimick the boil like sores which were one of the symptoms of the bubonic plague. Dismas, the good thief, hangs from a cross to the right of Jesus and an angel stands near his right shoulder ready to <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> his soul. The bad thief hangs on the cross to Jesus' left and in his case it is the devil who will <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> his soul. Both the angel and the devil clutch small doll like sculptures no doubt depictions of the souls they will eventually <b>carry</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E

It was also learned around this time that the two missing missionaries feared captured in Korea had in fact managed to escape to China. This news contributed to the decision to leave.|$|E

Thiess was steadfast in his assertions, {{claiming}} that werewolves in Germany and Russia also did battle with the devil's minions in their own versions of hell, and insisted that when werewolves died, their souls were welcomed into heaven as reward for their service. Thiess was ultimately sentenced to ten lashes for Idolatry and superstitious belief.|$|E
25|$|Baleen whales, Mysticeti, {{are often}} taken in gill-nets and in {{fisheries}} that use vertical lines to mark traps and pots. Large cetaceans such as humpback and right whales may <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> gear after entanglement. This explains the large scars borne by whales along the U.S. Atlantic coast. Analyses show that 50-70% of Gulf of Maine humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, and North Atlantic Right Whale, Eubalaena glacialis, have been entangled {{at least once}} in their lifetime. The North Atlantic right whale {{is one of the most}} endangered large cetaceans and only 300-350 individuals remain. Minke Whales, Balaenoptera acutorostrata, are also at risk.|$|E

25|$|Fourteen of the Susquehannocks {{had been}} {{elsewhere}} when the massacre occurred, and were removed to the workhouse in Lancaster for protection. Lazarus Stewart and Smith, asserting {{that one of}} those fourteen was known as a murderer, assembled the Paxton Boys again. Ignoring Col. Elder, who now remonstrated with them in person, they descended upon Lancaster on December 27, 1763 and broke into the workhouse. Matthew Smith later claimed that the intent of the raid had been to <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> the single murderous Indian, but the Paxton Boys, in short order, butchered the fourteen unfortunate Susquehannocks. These incidents became known as the Conestoga Massacre.|$|E
25|$|Members of the Lummi tell {{tales about}} Ts'emekwes, the local version of Bigfoot. The stories {{are similar to}} each other in the general {{descriptions}} of Ts'emekwes, but details differed among various family accounts concerning the creature's diet and activities. Some regional versions tell of more threatening creatures. The stiyaha or kwi-kwiyai were a nocturnal race. Children were warned against saying the names, lest the monsters hear and come to <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> a person—sometimes to be killed. In 1847, Paul Kane reported stories by the Indians about skoocooms, a race of cannibalistic wildmen living on the peak of Mount St. Helens in southern Washington state.|$|E
25|$|The {{new city}} {{was filled with}} colonists, {{most of whom were}} young, {{unmarried}} men; and while fugitives seeking asylum helped the population grow, single men greatly outnumbered women. With no intermarriage between Rome and neighboring communities, the new city would eventually fail. Romulus sent envoys to neighboring towns, appealing to them to allow intermarriage with Roman citizens, but his overtures were rebuffed. Romulus then formulated a plan to acquire women from other settlements. He announced a momentous festival and games, and invited the people of the neighboring cities to attend. Many did, in particular the Sabines, who came in droves. At a prearranged signal, the Romans began to snatch and <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> the marriageable women among their guests.|$|E

In 1894, the conservatory’s surrounding landscaping saw numerous transformations in {{preparations for the}} California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894. The Conservatory again was repainted in 1899 and received new floors of grooved concrete. At this point, the old floors, some of wood and some of concrete, were replaced by new grooved concrete. The grooves in the floor were intended to <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> the surplus water and make {{a visit to the}} conservatory more comfortable and pleasant. Several wooden plant benches that had rotted out were replaced by benches made of concrete wire netting to stand the constant change of temperature better than wood.|$|E
25|$|Two men are {{executed}} after {{refusing to}} follow a move order to fend off a Soviet winter attack—during which Lahtinen is killed while trying to <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> his Maxim M/32-33 machine gun and Rokka distinguishes himself by ambushing a 50-strong enemy unit with a Suomi KP/-31 submachine gun. The story moves onto the quiet trench warfare period of the War along the Svir river. The period includes the soldiers drinking kilju, a home-made alcoholic beverage, till intoxication during Commander-in-Chief Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim's birthday, a new recruit being killed by a sniper for failing to listen to advice from experienced veterans and raising his head above the trench, and Rokka capturing an enemy captain during a nightly Soviet skirmish to the Finnish positions.|$|E
25|$|The basements of bergfrieds {{were often}} {{embedded}} several metres into the ground. Undermining was therefore {{not a great}} threat. Arson was also very difficult due to their stone construction and the few light openings could be quickly closed to prevent being smoked out. The conservative historian therefore sees the bergfried {{as a means of}} passive defence, as a refuge for a few days until relief arrived. For this reason, very few facilities for active defence can be found in these buildings. The main aim was to prevent an attacker breaking in. To storm such a tower within a few days is almost impossible. Thanks to their solid construction many bergfrieds even escaped later demolition attempts by the surrounding rural population, who wanted to <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> building materials from abandoned castles and reuse them.|$|E
