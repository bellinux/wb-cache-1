Accurate modeling of T-lines to capture the related electrical effects has, therefore, become increasingly important. This paper describes a method to model the capacitance and conductance of T-Lines on CMOS multilayer, lossy substrates based on confor-mal mapping, and region subdivision. Tests show that the line parameters (per unit length) obtained by the method are frequency dependent and very accurate. The method is also suitable for parallel multiconductor interconnect modeling for high frequency circuits.

From these are deduced parallel results for the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of a graph. Some specific results are presented on the parities of the co-efficients of characteristic polynomials. A characterization is then determined for graphs in which the number of sets of independent edges is always even. This leads to an interesting link between matching polynomials and characteristic polynomials.

40|$|The recent {{upsurge in}} the demand of PV systems {{is due to}} the fact that they produce {{electric}} power without hampering the environment by directly converting the solar radiation into electric power. However the solar radiation never remains constant. It keeps on varying throughout the day. The need of the hour is to deliver a constant voltage to the grid irrespective of the variation in temperatures and solar insolation. We have designed a circuit such that it delivers constant and stepped up dc voltage to the load. We have studied the open loop characteristics of the PV array with variation in temperature and irradiation levels. Then we coupled the PV array with the boost converter in such a way that with variation in load, the varying input current and voltage to the converter follows the open <b>circuit</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the PV array closely. At various insolation levels, the load is varied and the corresponding variation in the input voltage and current to the boost converter is noted.

40|$|Abstract—This paper, for {{the first}} time, {{estimates}} the influences of the intrinsic-parameter fluctuations consisting of metal-gate work-function fluctuation (WKF), process-variation effect (PVE), and random-dopant fluctuation (RDF) on 16 -nm-gate planar metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) and circuits. The WKF and RDF dominate the threshold-voltage fluctuation (σVth); however, the WKF brings less impact on the gate capacitance and the cutoff frequency due to the screening effect of the inversion layer. The fluctuation of timing character-istics depends on the σVth and is therefore proportional to the trend of σVth. The power fluctuation consisting of the dynamic, short-circuit, and static powers is further investigated. The total power fluctuation for the planar MOSFET circuits is 15. 2 %, which is substantial in the reliability of circuits and systems. The static power is a minor part of the total power; however, its fluctuation is significant because of the serious fluctuation of the leakage cur-rent. For an amplifier circuit, the high-frequency characteristics, the circuit gain, the 3 -dB bandwidth, the unity-gain bandwidth power, and the power-added efficiency are explored consequently. Similar to the trend of the cutoff frequency, the PVE and RDF dominate both the device and <b>circuit</b> <b>characteristic</b> fluctuations due to the significant gate-capacitance fluctuations, and the WKF is less important at this simulation scenario. The extensive study assesses the fluctuations on circuit performance and reliability, which can, in turn, be used to optimize nanoscale MOSFETs and circuits.

A mechanical power reduction of 12 % was estimated for a sliding vane pump mechanically linked to the engine crankshaft while the benefits reached 22 % if the eccentricity actuation was considered.
