5|$|<b>Contagion</b> premiered on September 3, 2011 at the 68th Venice Film Festival in Venice, Italy, and a wider release {{followed}} on September 9. In the United States and Canada, <b>Contagion</b> {{was shown}} in 3,222 theaters, of which 254 screenings occurred at IMAX venues. Various American commercial analysts anticipated that the film would have ticket sales of between $20million and $25million during its opening weekend, which it did, grossing $8million on its first day, and $23.1M for the entire weekend. Of that total, ten percent ($2.3M) of the gross came from IMAX screenings. By outgrossing competitor The Help ($8.7M), <b>Contagion</b> became the highest-grossing film of the week. Demographically, the opening audience was evenly divided among gender, according to Warner Bros., while eighty percent of spectators were {{of the age of}} 25 and over. <b>Contagion</b> did well the following weekend, generating a $14.5M box office, but came in second to the re-release of The Lion King (1994). The third week saw the box office drop by forty percent, for a total gross of $8.7M. By the fourth week, <b>Contagion</b> had dropped to ninth place at the box office with $5M, and the number of theaters narrowed to 2,744. The film completed its theatrical run on December 15, 2011, at which point its total domestic gross was $75.6M.|$|E
5|$|<b>Contagion</b> premiered at the 68th Venice Film Festival in Venice, Italy on September 3, 2011, {{and went}} on general release on September 9. The film was well {{received}} by critics, who praised the narratives and the performances of various actors and actresses. It was also well received by scientists, who praised its accuracy. Commercially, the film was a box office success. Budgeted at $60 million, <b>Contagion</b> attained $135 million in box office revenue during its theatrical run.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Information <b>contagions</b> {{is one of}} the key {{applications}} in opportunistic mobile social networks (OMSNs). Most of the recent work only considers the simple <b>contagions,</b> in which the “infected ” node will infect each of its opinion-free neighbors through simple contact. However, when the behaviors, beliefs, or preferences spread through the social contact, the willingness to participate may require independent affirmation or reinforcement from multiple sources. In this paper, we first review two complex <b>contagions</b> schemes proposed recently: ring lattice-based complex <b>contagions</b> (RLCC) and grid-based complex <b>contagions</b> (GCC) approaches. However, these two approaches do not consider the hierarchical structure in social network. Then, we present three novel hierarchical complex <b>contagions</b> models: tree-based complex <b>contagions</b> (TCC), which is a binary tree model; clique-based complex <b>contagions</b> (CCC), in which there is a k-clique and other nodes connect to every node in the k-clique, and hypercube-based complex <b>contagions</b> (HCC), which is a balanced hypercube model. Extensive analysis and simulations are conducted in comparison to these approaches. CCC has the smallest delivery delay when there is only one message, while HCC has the best performance when the number of messages increases.

40|$|This article expands on {{an earlier}} concept of horror autotoxicus linked to digital <b>contagions</b> of spam and network Virality. 1 It aims to present, as such, a broader {{conception}} of cosmic topologies of imitation (CTI) intended to better grasp the relatively new practices of social media marketing. Similar to digital autotoxicity, CTI provide the perfect medium for sharing while also spreading <b>contagions</b> that can potentially contaminate the medium itself. However, whereas digital <b>contagions</b> are perhaps limited to the toxicity of a technical layer of information viruses, the <b>contagions</b> of CTI are an all pervasive auto-toxicity which can infect human bodies and technologies increasingly in concert with each other. This is an exceptional autotoxicus that significantly blurs the immunological line of exemption between self and nonself, and potentially, the anthropomorphic distinction between individual self and collective others...|$|R

A pustule on Torrance's body erupts in Osbourne's face, causing him to flee the room. Meanwhile, the fugitives steal an RV and stop at a gas station, where Paul calls his girlfriend, Elizabeth, looking for shelter. The station's clerk finds an infected Steve in the restroom; he is knocked unconscious by Paul. Scully calls Mulder after the Marshals raid the gas station, telling him that the <b>contagion</b> could spread into the population if the fugitives are not captured. Mulder sees a CDC biohazard team arrive at the scene, forcibly taking away the clerk in a helicopter.|$|E

5|$|The fugitives {{arrive at}} Elizabeth's house, where she tends to Steve, {{in the late}} stages of his infection. One of Steve's pustules erupts in her face, killing him and infecting Elizabeth. At that moment, Mulder and the Marshals raid the house and arrest her, but find Paul missing. Meanwhile, Scully traces Torrance's package to Pinck Pharmaceuticals, a major drug developer. She also finds an insect {{in the body of}} another prisoner. Dr. Osbourne, who has become infected, reveals that his team works for Pinck and are researching a dilating enzyme {{produced}} by the insect. However, the insect has a parasitic life cycle that kills its hosts. Osbourne claims that the insect and its <b>contagion</b> were deliberately introduced into the prison by Pinck as an experiment. He tells Scully that since she was next to him when he became infected, she may have contracted the <b>contagion</b> as well.|$|E

40|$|The bachelor´s thesis for {{the topic}} Epidemiologic {{characteristics}} of nosocomial <b>contagions</b> " has a {{character of a}} research. The thesis {{is divided into two}} sections, the theoretical and practical ones. The theoretical section presents the view of nosocomial <b>contagions.</b> It is divided into four chapters, in which there are concisely shown the pieces of knowledge on history of nosocomial <b>contagions,</b> on causative agents of <b>contagions</b> and their sources, was of transduction onto a sensitive individual, furthermore on kinds of nosocomial <b>contagions</b> and possibilities of prevention. In the practical section the attention is focused particularly on problems of state health surveillance within prevention of nosocomial <b>contagions.</b> The aim of the thesis was, on the basis of consultations with officers of the public health protection authority and study of documentation, to make familiar with problems of the state surveillance over operation of the health institutions including the range and sequence of acts within its performance. And subsequently to try to type of health workplaces, where there is the highest risk of origin of nosocomial <b>contagions.</b> And to ascertain, how the situation in question will develop for the four-year period. The Hypothesis 1 assumes that the highest risk of origin of nosocomial <b>contagions</b> refers to the health workplaces of surgical character, where there are carried out the performances, within which there is damaged the integrity of tissular barriers. The Hypothesis 2 expects that the frequency of defects in the health workplaces decreased for the monitored period. The Hypothesis 3 assumes that for the monitored period there came to improvement of situation in equipment of health workplaces with consumable medical material. For the purpose of verifying or rebutting the hypotheses it is applied the quantitative research in combination with the qualitative one, carried out by means of the analysis of documentation of the control departments in the health institutions. The file is formed by the control findings of hygienic stations for the four-year period. The sense of this thesis is the evaluation of pieces of knowledge of the control findings, elaboration of the survey of the most frequently occurring defects in health institutions and the attempt of ascertaining the trend of development for four-year period. The thesis may serve as a guideline of directing the control activities in the future period...|$|R
40|$|The {{strength}} of weak ties {{is that they}} tend to be long—they connect socially distant locations, allowing information to diffuse rapidly. The authors test whether this “{{strength of}} weak ties ” generalizes from simple to complex <b>contagions.</b> Complex <b>contagions</b> require social affirmation from multiple sources. Examples include the spread of high-risk social movements, avant garde fashions, and unproven technologies. Results show that as adoption thresholds increase, long ties can impede diffusion. Complex <b>contagions</b> depend primarily on the width of the bridges across a network, not just their length. Wide bridges are a characteristic feature of many spatial networks, which may account in part for the widely observed tendency for social movements to diffuse spatially. Most collective behaviors spread through social contact. From the emergence of social norms (Centola, Willer, and Macy 2005), to the adoption of technological innovations (Coleman, Katz, and Menzel 1966), to the growth of social movements (Marwell and Oliver 1993; Gould 1991, 1993; Zhao 1998; Chwe 1999), social networks are the pathways along which these “social <b>contagions</b> ” propagate.

40|$|Many <b>contagions</b> {{spread over}} {{various types of}} {{communication}} networks and their spreading dynamics have been extensively studied in the literature. Here we propose a general model for the concurrent spread of an arbitrary number of <b>contagions</b> in complex networks. The model is stochastic and runs in discrete time, and includes two widely used mechanisms by which a node can change its state. The first, termed the spontaneous state change mechanism, describes spontaneous transition to another state, while the second, termed the contact-induced state change mechanism, describes acquiring other <b>contagions</b> due to contact with the neighbors. We consider reactive discrete-time spreading processes of multiple concurrent <b>contagions</b> where time steps are of finite size without neglecting the possibility of multiple infecting events in a single time step. An essential element for making the model numerically tractable {{is the use of}} an approximation for the probability that a node transits to a specific state given any set of neighboring states. Different transmission probabilities may be present between each pair of states. We also derive corresponding continuous-time equations that are simple and intuitive. The model includes many well-known epidemic and rumor spreading models as a special case and it naturally captures spreading processes in multiplex networks...|$|R
