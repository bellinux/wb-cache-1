5|$|After {{successfully}} {{keeping the}} club in the Championship {{at the end of}} the 2016/17 season, Harry Redknapp signed a 12 month contract. After 8 games of the start of the 2017/18 season, which included 6 losses in a row, Redknapp was sacked; Lee Carsley was placed in temporary <b>change</b> <b>as</b> caretaker manager. On 29th September 2017 Steve Cotterill, who was assistant manager under Harry Redknapp for the last 3 games of the 2016/17 season, was appointed manager on a 2.5 year deal with Lee Carsley becoming assistant manager.|$|E

The congregation subsequently elected Jeanette Marks as a trustee. At this time {{the origins of the}} membership began to <b>change,</b> <b>as</b> Jews of Eastern European descent started joining the congregation.|$|E
5|$|All {{candidate}} theories {{still have}} major formal and conceptual problems to overcome. They also face the common problem that, as yet, {{there is no}} way to put quantum gravity predictions to experimental tests (and thus to decide between the candidates where their predictions vary), although there is hope for this to <b>change</b> <b>as</b> future data from cosmological observations and particle physics experiments becomes available.|$|E

5000|$|Halochromism {{occurs when}} a {{substance}} <b>changes</b> color <b>as</b> the pH <b>changes.</b> This is a property of pH indicators, whose molecular structure changes upon certain changes in the surrounding pH. This change in structure affects a chromophore in the pH indicator molecule. For example, phenolphthalein is a pH indicator whose structure <b>changes</b> <b>as</b> pH <b>changes</b> <b>as</b> shown in the following table: ...|$|R
5|$|Although the {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} die offs was the chytrid, climate change {{played a pivotal role}} in the extinctions. Researchers included this subtle connection in their inclusive climate-linked epidemic hypothesis, which acknowledged climatic <b>change</b> <b>as</b> a key factor in amphibian extinctions both in Costa Rica and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Aphasia is {{the result}} of damage to the brain's {{language}} centres affecting production, comprehension, or both, and can cause severe, chronic language impairment. Individuals with aphasia often communicate using a combination of speech, gestures, and aided communication; the proportion of each may <b>change</b> <b>as</b> the person recovers, and depends on the context and the individual's skills.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, in {{accordance}} with the political strategy, Minh's junta was reluctant to carry out large-scale offensives, which concerned the Americans, particularly Harkins, Taylor and CIA chief John McCone. While Harkins and Taylor had opposed Diệm's ouster, the junta's policies also disappointed many supporters of the anti-Diệm coup as they saw regime <b>change</b> <b>as</b> necessary to their hopes of a more aggressive anti-communist war. For their part, Minh's leadership group believed that a more low-key military approach was needed for their political campaign against the insurgency.|$|E

5|$|Certain non-inhibitory serpins {{also use}} the serpin {{conformational}} <b>change</b> <b>as</b> part of their function. For example, the native (S) form of thyroxine-binding globulin has high affinity for thyroxine, whereas the cleaved (R) form has low affinity. Similarly, transcortin has higher affinity for cortisol when in its native (S) state, than its cleaved (R) state. Thus, in these serpins, RCL cleavage and the S to R transition has been commandeered to allow for ligand release, rather than protease inhibition.|$|E
5|$|GCC sent {{delegations}} {{to all of}} {{the major}} international climate conventions. Only nations and non-profits may send official delegates to the United Nations Climate Change conferences. GCC registered with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate <b>Change</b> <b>as</b> a non-governmental organization, and executives from GCC members attended official UN conferences as GCC delegates.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of December 13, 1977, a {{dormitory}} fire killed ten female residents of Aquinas Hall. Meanwhile, the demographics of the student body continued to <b>change,</b> <b>as</b> women outnumbered men in incoming classes and non-Rhode Island students soon outnumbered in-state students. In 1984, Peterson also opened St. Thomas Aquinas Priory at the entrance of campus to accommodate the growing number of Dominican brethren living on campus.|$|E

5|$|Men on a Mission {{continued}} to challenge The Quebecers for the tag team belts. Men on a Mission won the title on March 29, 1994.

This title reign lasted only two days, however, as The Quebecers won the titles back in a rematch.|$|E
5|$|Relationships <b>change</b> <b>as</b> {{partners}} {{take on new}} roles, {{such as that of}} caregiver, {{which may}} conflict with the role of partner and require substantial sacrifice of time and self-care. These changes in responsibilities may mean a reverse in societally determined gender roles within relationships; inability to fulfil these roles affects sexuality in general.|$|E

Currently, more capacity is being installed in the rooftop than in the utility-scale segment. However, the worldwide distribution of solar parks is expected to <b>change</b> <b>as</b> different regions achieve grid parity. This transition also includes a shift from rooftop towards utility-scale plants, since the focus of new PV deployment has changed from Europe towards the Sunbelt markets where ground-mounted PV systems are favored.|$|E
