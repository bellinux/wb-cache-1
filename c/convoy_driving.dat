5000|$|In Norway, [...] "convoy driving" [...] (kolonnekjøring) is {{used during}} winter in case weather is {{too bad for}} {{vehicles}} to pass on their own. <b>Convoy</b> <b>driving</b> is initiated when the strong wind quickly fills the road with snow behind snowplows, particularly on mountain passes. Only {{a limited number of}} vehicles are allowed for each convoy and convoy leader is obliged to decline vehicles not fit for the drive. Storm convoys are prone to multiple-vehicle collision. <b>Convoy</b> <b>driving</b> is used through Hardangervidda pass on road 7 during blizzards. Convoy is sometimes used on road E134 at the highest and most exposed sections during bad weather. On road E6 through Saltfjellet pass <b>convoy</b> <b>driving</b> is often used when wind speed is over 15-20 m/s (fresh or strong gale) in winter conditions. During the winter of 1990 there was <b>convoy</b> <b>driving</b> for almost 500 hours at Saltfjellet ...|$|E

5000|$|On 23rd October he was {{the senior}} N.C.O. of the raiding party which {{attacked}} an enemy <b>convoy</b> <b>driving</b> from SIWA to MERSA MATRUH, assisting in destroying four Lancias.|$|E
50|$|Dayr Ayyub {{was first}} {{attacked}} by the predecessors to the Israel Defense Forces on the 21 December 1947, by 25 men, according to the village mukhtar. Three houses in the village were bombed, {{but there were no}} reports of casualties. On 7 February 1948, British troops moved into the village and demolished two houses. The Palestinian newspaper Filastin quoted a British communique which said that the houses had been used to fire on Jewish <b>convoys</b> <b>driving</b> by the village.|$|R
5000|$|A single {{howitzer}} was airdropped in April 1945 to the 2nd (Italian) SAS Regiment, {{a special}} force composed by partisans with mixed political allegiance, Russian ex-POWs, and Wehrmacht deserters, coordinated by Major Roy Farran. Baptized [...] "Molto Stanco" [...] ("Very tired" [...] in Italian), {{the gun was}} used in the course of Operation Tombola to harass enemy <b>convoys</b> <b>driving</b> up and down along Route 12 between Modena and Florence. On 21 April 1945, the howitzer was towed by means of a Willys Jeep to the outskirts of Reggio Emilia, from where the Italian gunners initiated a shelling of the city that wrought panic among Axis troops. Believing that the arrival of Allied forces was imminent, the Germans and their fascist allies evacuated the city.|$|R
50|$|Dallas 13 captures Houston, who fights {{back and}} kills him. Using Dallas 13's time-machine, Houston {{goes back to}} stop <b>Convoy</b> from <b>driving</b> off a cliff as the Coyotes attack. Convoy {{activates}} special cannons in his truck and goes into battle. Houston also reunites with her Team FAST siblings, whom {{she had not seen}} after she was abducted from a gymnastics class in 1973 (presumably by OMAR agents).|$|R
50|$|Rear {{marker lights}} or {{blackout}} taillights are typically {{housed in the}} same unit as the vehicles taillights, and are the main tool in keeping the proper following distance in nighttime <b>convoy</b> <b>driving.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the opening}} {{pages of the}} book David and John witness {{what appears to be}} a large {{military}} <b>convoy</b> <b>driving</b> through the outskirts of town. The convoy crashes, and the pair go to investigate. They discover a strange box guarded by G.I.Joe like action figures in the back of one of the convoy’s trucks.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to visit North Cape during winter, but the last stretch of road is only open for <b>convoy</b> <b>driving</b> at fixed hours. The road through Norway to North Cape is kept open during winter and is accessible to regular vehicles with some specific winter precautions being required {{to deal with the}} hard snow and wind conditions that may occur in winter. Before this, E69 was the only winter-closed E road in Europe.|$|E
50|$|After {{the signing}} of the Armistice with Germany on 11 November, some men of the {{squadron}} were assigned to transportation and <b>convoy</b> duty, <b>driving</b> trucks performing collection of equipment from front-line units and also moving personnel back from the lines. The 637th Aero Squadron returned to the United States in late May 1919. It arrived at Mitchel Field, New York, where the squadron members were demobilized and returned to civilian life.|$|R
50|$|Hofmann {{was among}} the group of terrorists {{who took part in}} the {{kidnapping}} of Hanns-Martin Schleyer. She walked along the road that Schleyer's convoy was passing pushing a pram laden with guns. She pushed the pram out into the middle of the street to stop the <b>convoy</b> from <b>driving</b> past, and as the cars slowed to a stop, she, along with a group of RAF terrorists, ambushed the cars, murdering Schleyer's driver, his bodyguard and two police officers.|$|R
50|$|After {{the second}} musical interlude, we {{discover}} that the truck <b>convoy</b> has been <b>driving</b> back to England for five weeks. Bloodnok has been continually drinking the sake all that time, which worries Seagoon as it means they won't get their back pay. In an aside to the audience, General Yakamoto reveals that he switched the sake with the nitroglycerin.|$|R
50|$|PROMETHEUS {{profited from}} the {{participation}} of Ernst Dickmanns, the 1980s pioneer of driverless cars, and his team at Bundeswehr Universität München, collaborating with Daimler-Benz. A first culmination point was achieved in 1994, when their twin robot vehicles VaMP and VITA-2 drove more than one thousand kilometers on a Paris multi-lane highway in standard heavy traffic at speeds up to 130 km/h. They demonstrated autonomous driving in free lanes, <b>convoy</b> <b>driving,</b> automatic tracking of other vehicles, and lane changes left and right with autonomous passing of other cars.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, {{the twin}} robot {{vehicles}} VaMP and Vita-2 of Daimler-Benz and Ernst Dickmanns of UniBwM drove more than 620 mi on a Paris three-lane highway in standard heavy traffic at {{speeds up to}} 81 mph, albeit semi-autonomously with human interventions. They demonstrated autonomous driving in free lanes, <b>convoy</b> <b>driving,</b> and lane changes with autonomous passing of other cars. That same year, Lucas Industries developed parts for a semi-autonomous car in a project that was funded by Jaguar Cars, Lucas, and the UK Department of Trade and Industry.|$|E
50|$|Two {{culmination}} {{points were}} achieved in 1994/95, when Dickmanns´ re-engineered autonomous S-Class Mercedes-Benz performed international demonstrations. The {{first was the}} final presentation of the PROMETHEUS project in October 1994 on Autoroute 1 near the airport Charles-de-Gaulle in Paris. With guests on board, the twin vehicles of Daimler-Benz (VITA-2) and UniBwM (VaMP) drove more than one thousand kilometers on the three-lane highway in standard heavy traffic at speeds up to 130 km/h. Driving in free lanes, <b>convoy</b> <b>driving</b> with distance keeping depending on speed, and lane changes left and right with autonomous passing have been demonstrated; the latter required interpreting the road scene also in the rear hemisphere. Two cameras with different focal lengths for each hemisphere {{have been used in}} parallel for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|Truckers' convoys {{were created}} as a {{byproduct}} of the USA's national 55 mph speed limit and 18-wheelers becoming the prime targets of speed traps. Most truckers had difficult schedules to keep {{and as a result}} had to maintain a speed above the posted speed limit to reach their destinations on time. Convoys were started so that multiple trucks could run together at a high speed with the rationale being that if they passed a speed trap the police would only be able to pull over one of the trucks in the <b>convoy.</b> When <b>driving</b> on a highway, convoys are also useful to conserve fuel by drafting.|$|R
2500|$|On 16 March, the Commando Raiders were helilifted to {{a landing}} zone [...] east of Kiu Kacham, {{to be joined}} by BG 121. BG 122 was also lifted to a new {{location}} into a hilltop position overlooking Sala Phou Khoun from the west. They walked down to an unoccupied intersection and greeted the <b>convoys</b> of troops <b>driving</b> in from both north and south.|$|R
25|$|On 13 April, {{partly in}} revenge for the Deir Yassin massacre, a <b>convoy</b> that was <b>driving</b> towards Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital on Mount Scopus was {{attacked}} by hundreds of Arabs. In the seven-hour battle 79 Jews were killed including doctors and patients. Thirteen British soldiers were present, but they stood by, only putting in a perfunctory attempt at intervention in the last moments of the massacre.|$|R
5000|$|The New York Times {{reports that}} the killings were carried out by police during [...] "riots in the Galilee region to protest over Israeli {{expropriation}} of Arab land." [...] In Arutz Sheva, Ezra HaLevi writes that the riots started the night before, [...] "with Israeli-Arabs throwing rocks and firebombs at police and soldiers. The riots continued {{the next day and}} intensified, resulting in many wounded members of Israeli security forces and the death of the six Arab rioters." [...] Yosef Goell, writing in The Jerusalem Post, says that, [...] "What actually set off the rioting that led to the deaths was a wild attack by hundreds of inflamed young Arabs on an unsuspecting IDF <b>convoy</b> <b>driving</b> on the road by the villages of Sakhnin, Arrabe and Deir Hanna. There was no prior provocation on the part of that IDF convoy, unless one insists on seeing a provocation in the very presence of an Israeli army unit in the heart of Israeli Galilee." ...|$|E
5000|$|Crysis Warhead {{takes place}} during {{the events of the}} {{original}} Crysis in 2020, when an ancient alien spacecraft is uncovered on the fictional Lingshan Islands, east of the Philippines. The player controls former British SAS Sergeant Michael [...] "Psycho" [...] Sykes, a member of the Raptor Team, a squad of mostly American soldiers outfitted with advanced technology. Warhead takes place {{on the other side of}} the island in which Crysis is set and begins after Psycho, a supporting character in Crysis, splits up with Nomad following their raid on the North Korean harbour. Psycho witnesses a North Korean warship being bombarded by U.S. Navy fighter jets. Leaving the shore, he joins a vehicle <b>convoy</b> <b>driving</b> through the jungle, and defends it as it is attacked by North Korean soldiers. The convoy is destroyed and the Marines fight into the night. The VTOL that tries to evacuate the destroyed convoy's Marines is hit by a missile and crash-lands. Psycho awakes and goes to find a better position for the surviving Marines, but gets attacked by an EMP blast from a container being lifted away by a North Korean helicopter. Psycho is later assigned a mission to pursue another North Korean container that JSOC believes contains a nuclear warhead. As the mission progresses, Psycho is reunited with friend Sean O'Neill who was originally going to have Nomad's spot on Raptor Team. He was replaced by Nomad after failing an evaluation test. Psycho, against the wishes of Commander Emmerson, helps O'Neill after his F-35C jet is shot down, and takes him to a VTOL to escape.|$|E

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION <b>Convoy</b> <b>driving</b> on a public highway is a phenomena with multiple benefits. It makes driving safer, it increases the throughput of the highway and decreases travel time. As highway traffic is often modelled by analogies with fluid dynamics [1], in this language <b>convoy</b> <b>driving</b> corresponds to a flow without turbulences...|$|E
50|$|For these services, Pasley {{was given}} the 50-gun HMS Jupiter and in her served in several squadrons and actions, {{fighting}} the French at the Battle of Porto Praya under George Johnstone and capturing a Dutch squadron at the Battle of Saldanha Bay (1781). On both occasions Pasley was directly responsible for destroying or capturing numerous enemy war vessels and merchant ships. In 1782 he convoyed Admiral Hugh Pigot to the West Indies and then cruised off Havana, destroying seven merchants from a <b>convoy</b> and then <b>driving</b> off two Spanish ships of the line {{when they tried to}} intervene. At the war's conclusion in 1783, Jupiter was paid off and Pasley returned to half-pay.|$|R
50|$|Bremer {{was later}} heavily criticized for officially {{disbanding}} the former Iraqi Army. Bremer, however, contends {{that there were}} no armies to disband, despite that American commanders at that time were negotiating with senior Iraqi army officers on how to use the Iraqi army for security purposes. He claimed that many soldiers simply left after the fall of Baghdad; some to protect their own families from the rampant looting. Critics claimed his extreme measures, including the firing of thousands of school teachers and removing Ba'ath party members from top government positions, helped create and worsen an atmosphere of discontent. As the insurgency grew stronger, so did the criticisms. Bremer was also in personal danger because of Iraqi perceptions of him and was henceforth heavily guarded. Attempts to assassinate him took place on numerous occasions—one of the more publicized events occurred on December 6, 2003, when his <b>convoy</b> was <b>driving</b> on the dangerous Baghdad Airport Road while returning to the fortified Green Zone. The convoy was hit by a bomb and gunfire, with the rear window of his official car blown away and as bullets flew, Bremer and his deputies ducked below their seats. No injuries or casualties were reported and news of the attack on Bremer was not released until December 19, 2003, during his visit to Basra.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years, the {{increase}} of the fuel price {{and the need to}} reduce the greenhouse gas emissions have triggered the research on lowering the fuel consumption within the transport sector. The research not only involves the development of more efficient engines but also the exploration of new transportation paradigms. One promising approach is to create vehicle platoons, i. e. <b>convoys</b> of vehicles <b>driving</b> close to each other. Vehicles driving close behind benefit from the reduction of the air drag and hence their overall fuel consumptions are reduced. This work focuses on studying platoons of heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs). More specifically, the work analyzes real position data of an HDV fleet from one manufacturer. The objective is to determine the potentials to reduce the fuel consumption of the fleet through platoon formations, using low sampled GPS traces obtained from the fleet management system. Map matching and path inference algorithms have been developed to reconstruct the path of the vehicles on a given road network. The reconstructed paths are used to analyze the vehicles’ positions and inter-vehicle distances. Results show that the vehicles are widely spread. The average distance to the closest vehicle is greater than 20 km, which limits the platoon opportunities. Although with limited platoon opportunities, potential fuel savings up to 0. 14 % of the whole fleet’s consumption have been obtained. Results suggest that fuel savings can be largely improved if the density of vehicles in the road network is increased...|$|R

40|$|With {{rapid growth}} in {{motorway}} (freeway) traffic, various intelligent transport systems, which may benefit road capacity by increasing throughput and decreasing emissions, are rapidly evolving around the globe. However, the design and assessment {{of many of these}} measures (e. g. cooperative convoying) to address these issues must be developed off-line because of the cost and risks of potential field trials. Simulation is a crucial tool in this process, although such techniques depend for their validity {{on the quality of the}} underlying models of driver behavior. In this paper, a microscopic simulation model, FLOWSIM, featured with fuzzy inference systems, is introduced. Using FLOWSIM, the dynamic stability of a <b>convoy</b> <b>driving</b> system under different communication conditions was investigated.
