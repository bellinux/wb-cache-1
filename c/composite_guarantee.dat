The first material was sintered using the mixture containing 80 wt. % diamond, 15 wt. % of Ti–Si–C powder (mixture of 47. 1 wt. % Ti_{ 3 }SiC_{ 2 } and TiSi_{ 2 }, TiC and SiC, from self-propagating high-temperature synthesis) and 5 wt. % nanometric Ti(CN) powders. The second material was prepared using diamond powder and 10 wt. % of titanium diboride. Materials were sintered using a Bridgman-type high-pressure apparatus at 8 GPa {{and at the}} temperature of 2000 °C. The third material was a commercial PCD containing 88 wt. % of diamond, 10 wt. % of Co and 2 wt. % of WC. The coefficients of friction for diamond composites in a sliding contact with an Al_{ 2 }O_{ 3 } ceramic ball were determined from room temperature of up to 800 °C, in air. X-ray diffraction patterns of diamond composites after HP–HT sintering and wear tests are presented. In the studies, due {{to the use of}} Raman spectroscopy the strong influence of the bonding phase on the oxidation of diamond composites was confirmed. The most thermally stable material is the diamond composite with TiB_{ 2 }.

However, {{for similar}} reasons to the Gotze et al. classification we decided their solution instead supports a dynamic majority voter. Moreover, the response latency of the A-NVP <b>composite</b> is <b>guaranteed</b> {{not to exceed}} a maximum response time defined by the client. If no absolute majority could be established before the maximum response time, an exception will be issued to signal that consensus {{could not be found}} (Buys et al. [2011]). In addition, according to Townend et al. ([2005]), their solution supports different types of voting algorithms to choose from. However, we inferred that the dynamic consensus voting is the only decision mechanism supported. The voter is dynamic as it can process 0 to n results, where n is the number of executed variant services. Specifically, the voting discards results of any variant service whose weighting falls below a user-defined value and subsequently performs consensus voting on the remaining results. The weighting is based on the confidence of that service returning a correct result.|$|R

We contend {{that this is}} not in general done in a uniform and integral manner. We present a modified design for an ACtive Object-Oriented DBMS (ACOOD) currently under development at the University of Sk ovde. The design emphasises the key concepts being investigated, namely Events and Rules as 1 st Class (ER 1 C). It is important because it addresses the key issue of inheritance, something not prominent in current prototype systems with a fully developed event specification system. Key features in the design are that it has a unifying concept of primitive event and of behaviour, and achieves uniformity and power with respect to inheritance. It further relates this to event specification languages for <b>composite</b> events, <b>guaranteeing</b> orthogonality of features. The paper emphasises modeling concepts, and the design is therefore of relevance to all active, object-oriented database systems. It seeks to explore the wider implications and underpinnings of current active O-O suggestions rather than enriching event and/or rule specification languages...|$|R

The proposed method uses a highly computational efficient response surface model (RSM), based on radial basis functions, to ensure full coverage of the design space and to reduce simulation time. The RSM {{is based on the}} results of an experimental design setup (DoE) with a quasi-linear complexity. The DoE uses a systematic fractional replicate screening design, to screen out important circuit factors and to guarantee a limited RSM complexity. A resolution V fractional factorial design and a central <b>composite</b> design <b>guarantee</b> a good model accuracy. The method is validated over a broad range of both analog and digital circuits and compared to traditional Monte-Carlo reliability simulation techniques. It is shown to outperform existing simulators with a simulation speed improvement of up to several orders of magnitude.

40|$|The {{human body}} can be modeled as a kinematically {{redundant}} manipulator which exploits ""redundant degrees of freedom"" to execute various motions in a suitable fashion. Differently from the typical kinematically redundant robots that {{are attached to}} the fixed ground, the zero moment point (ZMP) condition should be taken into account not to fall down. Thus, this paper investigates a motion planning algorithm for kinematically redundant manipulator standing on the ground. For this, a geometric constraint equation is derived from the existing ZMP equation. This constraint equation is formed like a second-order kinematic equation, which enables one to plan the ZMP trajectory in a feed-forward fashion. This constraint equation and the kinematic equation of the manipulator model are solved together. Then, the solution of this <b>composite</b> equation <b>guarantees</b> both the desired operational motion and the ZMP trajectory. The feasibility of the proposed algorithms is verified by simulating and experimenting several motions though a planar 3 -DOF manipulator model.

We {{study the}} {{verification}} problem for e-service (and workflow) speci-fications, aiming at efficient techniques for guiding {{the construction of}} <b>composite</b> e-services to <b>guarantee</b> desired properties (e. g., deadlock avoidance, bounds on resource usage, response times). Based on e-service frameworks such as AZTEC and e-FLow, decision flow language Vortex, we introduce a very simple e-service model for our investigation of verification issues. We first show how three different model checking techniques are applied {{when the number of}} processes is limited to a predetermined number. We then introduce pid quantified constraint, a new sym-bolic representation that can encode infinite many system states, to verify systems with unbounded and dynamic process instantiations. We think that it is a versatile technique and more suitable for verification of e-service specifications. If this is combined with other techniques such as abstraction and widening, it is possible to solve a large category of interesting verification problems for e-services. ...|$|R

The {{objective of this}} clinical investigation was to evaluate, retrospectively, the clinical effectiveness of earlier-investigated dentin adhesive systems (Scotchbond, Gluma, Clearfil New Bond, Scotchbond 2, Tenure, and Tripton), and to compare their clinical results with those obtained with four modern total-etch adhesive systems (Bayer exp. 1 and 2, Clearfil Liner Bond System, and Scotchbond Multi-Purpose). In total, 1177 Class V cervical lesions {{in the teeth of}} 346 patients were restored following two cavity designs: In Group A, enamel was neither beveled nor intentionally etched, as per ADA guidelines; in Group B, adjacent enamel was beveled and conditioned. Clinical retention rates definitely indicated the improved clinical efficacy of the newest dentin adhesives over the earlier systems. With regard to adhesion strategy, adhesive systems that removed the smear layer and concurrently demineralized the dentin surface layer performed clinically better than systems that modified the disorderly layer of smear debris without complete removal. Hybridization by resin interdiffusion into the exposed dentinal collagen layer, combined with attachment of resin tags into the opened dentin tubules, appeared to be essential for reliable dentin bonding but might be insufficient by itself. The additional formation of an elastic bonding area as a polymerization shrinkage absorber and the use of a microfine restorative <b>composite</b> apparently <b>guaranteed</b> an efficient clinical result.

This thesis discusses {{the design and}} verification of behaviors of composite web services. To model composite web services, two behaviors are proposed, namely control and operational. The operational behavior shows the business logic of the process functionality for a composite web service. The control behavior shows the constraints that the operational behavior should satisfy and specifies the states that this behavior should be in. The idea behind this separation is to promote the design, verification and reusability of web services in <b>composite</b> settings. To <b>guarantee</b> their compatibility, these two behaviors communicate and synchronize through conversation messages. State charts are used to model composite web services and symbolic model checking with NuSMV model checker is used to verify their conversations.

40|$|A {{transistor}} level representation for VLSI circuits is presented. This {{representation is}} simple but general, technology independent, hierarchical, and maintains connectivity, circuit schematic information, {{and the information}} for mask geometry. A transistor level cell is represented as the interconnection of devices along with their types, sizes and placement, and the cell's typed ports. Connection is represented explicitly by shared connection points. The ports describe the interface between this cell and other cells. This representation, together {{with a set of}} synthesis and analysis rules, enforces the description of strictly legal designs. The synthesis rules ensure that each structure is correct by construction. The analysis rules check for geometrical design rule violations which cannot, by their nature, be enforced by construction. A file of technology dependent information indicates how to implement each transistor type, interconnect type and connection point type, as well as how structure types may interact. Cells described in this representation may be composed hierarchically to form larger cells. Given a valid composition, the topology, geometry and connectivity of the <b>composite</b> structure is <b>guaranteed</b> to be legal.

It is often assumed that reconstruction with <b>composite</b> free flaps <b>guarantees</b> better function and aesthetics than bridging the defect with reconstruction plates. Methods Using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C 30 version 3. 0 and EORTC QLQ-H&N 35), we compared HRQoL in patients who received free fibula flaps versus reconstruction plates after segmental resection of the lateral mandible. Results Thirty-seven completed questionnaires (18 fibula reconstructions and 19 patients with reconstruction plates) were available. Reconstruction with a free fibula flap did not provide clear additional benefit to bridging the defect with a reconstruction plate after segmental resection of the lateral mandible. In particular aspects known {{to have the most}} impact on HRQoL like swallowing, speech and chewing were not influenced by the type of reconstruction. Conclusions Reconstruction of segmental defects of the lateral mandible with free fibula flap and reconstruction plate resulted in comparable HRQoL. If dental rehabilitation by means of dental implants is not anticipated in the fibula, then plate reconstruction with adequate soft tissue remains a suitable technique for the reconstruction of segmental defects of the lateral mandible...|$|R

For linearized applications, Fortran D is extended with logical topology and index array specifications. With the information provided in these specifications, it is shown how regular, linearized applications can be parallelized automatically in Fortran D as regular computations using their natural topology. In composite grid problems, meshes are coupled to form larger, more complex topology structures. Composite grid problems arise in important application areas such as fluid flow simulation, aerodynamic simulation, electric circuit simulation, and nuclear reactor simulation.

The frame system is based on continuous steel trusses and composite steel columns. Floors are typically hollow core slabs. The structural characteristics of shopping centre buildings were researched by examining executed targets in Finland, Sweden and Norway. In analyzed frames the first two storeys are typically parking levels. Above parking levels are hypermarket and commercial levels. On the roof is a technical level. All floor to floor heights and clearances were defined by target reviews. In the parking levels the columns grid is 17, 0 x 5, 4 m 2 and in the upper levels 17, 0 x 10, 8 m 2. The height of steel trusses is determined by optimizing consumptions of steel and required stiffness and also by ensuring adequate routing space for HVACE-utilities. Loads are determined by usage of levels and by Eurocodes. Four static frame models were analyzed. The static function of the frame and critical loads were clarified. The largest loads 5 - 10 kN/m 2 were applied on hypermarket and commercial levels and 2, 5 kN/m 2 was applied on parking levels. The research exhibited that the size of columns was determined by N-M resistance not the sway-factor αcr. The factor αcr is in all researched frame models over 10 so frames are non-sway. Using continuous steel trusses instead of one-bay trusses the circular section of middle columns is about 50 - 100 mm larger. The frame of the shopping centre must be adaptable and configurable. Structural elements that limit the use of space, such as shear walls, bracings and struts, should be avoided or minimized in order to improve the efficiency of the space.
