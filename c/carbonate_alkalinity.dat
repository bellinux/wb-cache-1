Solutions produced in a laboratory may contain a virtually limitless number of bases that contribute to alkalinity. Alkalinity is usually given in the unit mEq/L (milliequivalent per liter).

50|$|Salinity has a {{different}} effect on the saturation state of calcite and aragonite, causing increases in these values and in calcium concentrations with higher salinity, favoring the precipitation of calcium <b>carbonate.</b> Both <b>alkalinity,</b> or acid buffering capacity, and CaCO3 saturation state increase with salinity, which may help estuarine organisms to overcome fluctuations in pH that could otherwise negatively impact shell formation. However, river waters in some estuaries are oversaturated with calcium carbonate, while mixed estuarine water is undersaturated due to low pH resulting from respiration. Highly eutrophic estuaries support high amounts of planktonic and benthic animals that consume oxygen and produce carbon dioxide, which lowers the pH of estuarine waters {{and the amount of}} free carbonate. Therefore, even though higher salinity can cause increased saturation states of calcite and aragonite, there are many other factors that interact in this system to influence the shell deposition of estuarine organisms.|$|R

After 24 min carbonation, the bicarbonate alkalinity reached its maximum value of 2377 mg L– 1, and hydroxide and <b>carbonate</b> <b>alkalinity</b> were virtually absent. After 30 and 60 min carbonation, bicarbonate alkalinity started to decrease slightly as the pH of the slurry increased.

Based on these experiments, a calculation of the amount of carbon dioxide that could be removed annually at aluminium refineries in Australia is potentially 15 million tonnes, and suggests that further studies are necessary to maximize this carbon removal process.

40|$|Alkalinity can {{be defined}} as the ability of water to {{neutralize}} acid or to absorb hydrogen ions. It is the sum of all acid neutralizing bases in the water. In municipal and industrial wastewater there are many factors which contribute to alkalinity like, the type of dissolved inorganic and organic compounds, the amount of suspended organic matter and also, the bicarbonate to dissolved CO 2 ratio. The bacteria and other biological entities which play an active role in wastewater treatment are most effective at a neutral to slightly alkaline pH of 7 to 8. In order to maintain these optimal pH conditions for biological activity there must be sufficient alkalinity present in the waste water to neutralize acids generated by the active biomass during waste treatment. This ability to maintain the proper pH in the wastewater as it undergoes treatment is the reason why alkalinity is so important to the wastewater industry.
