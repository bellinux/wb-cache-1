500|$|The hearing, {{which took}} place within the Palace of Westminster, began on 11 May 1871 before Sir William Bovill, who was Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. The Claimant's legal team was led by William Ballantine and Harding Giffard, both highly {{experienced}} advocates. Opposing them, acting on instructions from {{the bulk of the}} Tichborne family, were John Duke Coleridge, the Solicitor General (he was promoted to Attorney-General during the hearing), and Henry Hawkins, a future High Court judge who was then {{at the height of his}} powers as a <b>cross-examiner.</b> In his opening speech, Ballantine made much of Roger Tichborne's unhappy childhood, his overbearing father, his poor education and his frequently unwise choices of companions. The Claimant's experiences in an open boat following the wreck of the Bella had, said Ballantine, impaired his memories of his earlier years, which explained his uncertain recall. Attempts to identify his client as Arthur Orton were, Ballantine argued, the concoctions of [...] "irresponsible" [...] private investigators acting for the Tichborne family.|$|E

6000|$|These were {{suggestions}} that deserved the closest {{consideration of the}} Authorities charged with the repression of crime.

60|$|For all his experience, it so {{happened}} {{that he had}} never seen Waterbuck, Q.C., before, and, like many Forsytes in the lower branch of the profession, he had an extreme admiration for a good <b>cross-examiner.</b> The long, lugubrious folds in his cheeks relaxed somewhat after seeing him, especially as he now perceived that Soames alone was represented by silk.|$|E
50|$|For {{an example}} of an {{admission}} by a <b>cross-examiner,</b> see Zungu's case.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{sometimes}} referred to as an art form, because of the need for an attorney to know precisely how to elicit the testimony from the opposing witness that will help, not hinder, their client's case. Typically, a <b>cross-examiner</b> must not only be effective at getting the witness to reveal the truth, but in most cases to reveal confusion as to the facts such as time, dates, people, places, wording etc. More often than not, a <b>cross-examiner</b> will also attempt to undermine the credibility of a witness if doing so will not cause the <b>cross-examiner</b> to be perceived as a bully (such as discrediting a very elderly person or young child).|$|E
6000|$|... "Foxy ferreting," [...] Montague Nevitt repeated, drawing {{back as if}} stung, and profoundly astonished. [...] "Why, what do {{you mean}} by that, Mr. Gildersleeve?

40|$|Questioning {{in common}} law accusatorial trials is {{dominated}} by the advocates’ belief that it is a legitimate opportunity for advocacy rather than just investigation. Examination is a form of story-telling, leading <b>cross-examiners</b> to rely heavily on rhetorical and suggestive questions that advance the preferred narrative. Empirical research suggests that this style of questioning reduces witness accuracy, reduces public confidence in the trial and deters witnesses from coming forward. However, the English courts’ new initiative to change practice by shifting advocates’ beliefs about the aims of cross-examination shows promise. No Full Tex...|$|R
50|$|The {{duty of the}} <b>cross-examiner</b> is to put {{his case}} to a witness. For the {{application}} of this principle to the prosecutor as well, see S v Manicum Although, in S v Fortuin, the court is generally conceded to have arrived at the correct conclusion, it confused the effect of not cross-examining.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>cross-examiner</b> often {{needs to}} {{discredit}} a potentially biased or damaging {{witness in the}} eyes of the jury without appearing to be doing so in an unfair way. Typically, the <b>cross-examiner</b> must appear friendly, talk softly and sincerely to relax the guarded witness. Or on other occasions they may start by being more confrontational, unsettling an already disturbed witness. They typically begin repeating similar basic questions in a variety of different ways to get different responses, which will then be used against the witness as misstatements of fact later when the attorney wants to make their point. If it is too obvious the questions are too clearly repetitive and making the witness nervous, the other attorney may accuse the cross examiner of badgering the witness. There is a fine line between badgering and getting the witness to restate facts differently that is typically pursued.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{a measure}} of drama that {{cross-examination}} adds to any trial because of the challenging of the statements made by a witness. In the 1903 book titled The Art of Cross-Examination by Francis L. Wellman much effort is devoted to highlighting components of cross-examination and the effect on trials of the past century. An example of an inflammatory way a question will be asked by a <b>cross-examiner</b> to a witness he was trying to undermine would be [...] "What is your recollection toDAY?" [...] implying it was stated differently yesterday. Simply the accent of syllables can leave a bewildered jury believing they must put their guard up with a witness-or in some cases the <b>cross-examiner</b> if they are not careful. The book freely uses accenting in its dialogue to give the reader such insight as to how cross-examiners rattle witnesses to obtain their desired effect for the jury.|$|E
50|$|It has in my {{experience}} always been a rule of professional practice that, unless notice has already clearly been given of the <b>cross-examiner's</b> intention to rely upon such matter, {{it is necessary to}} put to an opponent's witness in cross-examination the nature of the case upon which it is proposed to rely in contradiction of his evidence, particularly where that case relies upon inferences to be drawn from other evidence in the proceedings. Such a rule of practice is necessary both to give the witness the opportunity to deal with that other evidence, or the inferences to be drawn from it, and to allow the other party the inference sought to be drawn.|$|R
40|$|Cross-examination is {{used both}} in debate and in legal proceedings. Commentators in both fields have offered {{suggestions}} to <b>cross-examiners</b> {{on the proper}} content of the cross-examination period. This study will attempt to analyze the suggestions of both debate writers and legal writers on the proper question content of the cross-examination period. After surveying the writers 2 ̆ 7 suggestions, an attempt {{will be made to}} compare the ideas offered by the two groups of writers.

Therefore, the comparisons which are made will attempt to show how these more extensive legal suggestions might be utilized by the debater...|$|R
50|$|In January 1952, an IDF patrol seized two Arab villagers {{in a field}} 300 meters on the Jordanian side of the {{armistice}} line and brought them to an abandoned house in Walaja, where they were killed. Israel told UN investigators {{that they had been}} shot inside Israeli territory when they had jumped out from behind a rock. The UN and Jordanian <b>cross-examiners</b> were unable to obtain an Israeli admission, but the Israeli delegate on the Mixed Armistice Commission wrote privately to his superior that the allegations were true but the patrol was not acting under orders. The village was completely destroyed during the 1948 war and the villagers rebuilt it east of the 1949 Armistice Line inside the West Bank territories.|$|R
50|$|Explicit assertions by the <b>cross-examiner</b> may {{constitute}} admissions, {{eliminating the}} need for proof. For example, in a traffic case for negligence, the defendant’s counsel may put it to a witness that the client, although he admits to driving the other vehicle, denies any negligence. This would constitute an admission that the defendant was the driver. This underscores the need for caution and care in cross-examination.|$|E
50|$|In the United States federal Courts, a cross-examining {{attorney}} is typically {{not permitted to}} ask questions that do not pertain to the testimony offered during direct examination, but most state courts do permit a lawyer {{to cross-examine a witness}} on matters not raised during direct examination. Similarly, courts in England, South Africa, Australia, and Canada allow a <b>cross-examiner</b> to exceed the scope of direct examination.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his earlier}} life, Kennedy had {{developed}} a reputation as the family's attack dog. He was a hostile <b>cross-examiner</b> on Joseph McCarthy's Senate committee; a fixer and leg-breaker as JFK's campaign manager; and unforgiving and merciless cutthroat - his father's son, right down to Joseph Kennedy's purported observation that [...] "he hates like me." [...] Yet Bobby Kennedy somehow became a liberal icon, an antiwar visionary who try to outflank Lyndon Johnson's Great Society from the left.|$|E
50|$|The {{less the}} witness says, and the slower the witness speaks, the more control they can {{maintain}} {{under the pressure}} of a crafty opponent. The key for a witness is to understand the facts that they believe to be the case and not add additional thoughts to those facts, lest they be used to undermine the testimony. Sticking to the brief known facts is key for the witness, making it difficult for the <b>cross-examiner</b> to make the witness appear confused, biased or deceitful. The cross examiner will assume the witness has been told that and begin asking supporting questions about where the witness was, what time it was, what the witness saw, what they said, and sooner or later upon asking again the witness may use a different word that will give the <b>cross-examiner</b> a chance to ask the question again doubtfully and pointedly implying contradiction. The witness will try typically to explain and clarify, which sometimes reveals weakness in the witness's statements of fact. Other times the witness is just being truthful but undermined for the purpose of casting doubt to the jury and or judge.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Ballantine {{retired from the}} law in order to write and travel, {{publishing}} several volumes of reminiscences. His interest in the theatre and journalism made him a familiar sight around London. Although he was recognised as an incisive <b>cross-examiner,</b> Ballantine was not regarded by his peers as being 'a model legal mind.' The Law Times, in his obituary, stated that Ballantine [...] "left behind him scarcely any lesson, even in his own poor biography, which the rising generation could profitably learn." ...|$|E

Of his character, she wrote, “Thompson never consumed any alcohol, neither did he smoke.

He was created a serjeant-at-law on 2 November 1868: he was the last person received into Serjeants' Inn who was not a judge. Like his fellow serjeants-at-law, John Humffreys Parry, William Ballantine, and John Walter Huddleston (afterwards Baron Huddleston), he enjoyed a lucrative practice at the Old Bailey, and took part in many leading criminal trials, being a most effective <b>cross-examiner</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|Courts permit {{parties to}} {{cross-examine}} {{a witness in}} order to impeach that witness based on demonstration of bias. Witness bias may be catalyzed by any number of circumstances, ranging from the witness's blood relationship to a party to his financial stake in the outcome of the litigation. Most US jurisdictions require a <b>cross-examiner</b> to lay a foundation before extrinsic evidence can be used to demonstrate bias for impeachment purposes. Although Rule 610 provides that evidence of a witness's [...] "religious beliefs or opinions is not admissible to attack or support the witness's credibility," [...] an inquiry into the witness's religious beliefs or opinions for the purpose of showing interest or bias because of them is not within the rule's prohibition.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{purposes}} of cross-examination are to elicit favorable facts from the witness, or to impeach {{the credibility of}} the testifying witness to lessen the weight of unfavorable testimony. Cross-examination frequently produces critical evidence in trials, especially if a witness contradicts previous testimony. The advocate Edward Marshall-Hall built his career on cross-examination that often involved histrionic outbursts designed to sway jurors. Most experienced and skilled cross-examiners however, refrain from caustic or abrasive cross-examination so as to avoid alienating jurors. John Mortimer, Queen's Counsel, observed that [...] "cross-examination" [...] was not the art of examining crossly. Indeed the good <b>cross-examiner</b> gets a witness to assert to a series of linked propositions culminating in one that undermines that witnesses' evidence rather than pursuing an antagonistic approach.|$|E
50|$|Born in Howland Street, Tottenham Court Road in Camden, London, {{the son of}} a police-magistrate, Ballantine {{was educated}} at St Paul's School, and called to the Bar in 1834. He joined the Criminal Court and {{travelled}} the judicial 'Home Circuit', which necessitated him attending courts in Hertfordshire, Kent, Surrey, Sussex and Essex. As a young man he had a wide familiarity with dramatic and literary society, meeting many writers, including Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray and Anthony Trollope, and this background helped to obtain for him a large legal practice, particularly in criminal cases. In the late 1840s, Ballantine became known as a formidable <b>cross-examiner,</b> having become involved in several famous cases, where he was able to display these skills. His great rival at during this period was Serjeant Parry (1816-1880).|$|E
50|$|The key to {{effective}} cross-examination is {{the realization that}} true cross-examination is the <b>cross-examiner</b> testifying and the witness agreeing or adopting {{the facts of the}} question. This is accomplished by the use of leading questions; questions which suggest the answer and which can only be answered with a yes or no. Witnesses will of course attempt to explain their answer or even attempt to answer a question not before that witness in order to deflect the impact of the question. The cross-examining attorney has the right to object to non-responsive answers and to call upon the court to admonish the witness to answer the question as posed. The cross-examining attorney will ask only those questions which assist his or her cause and never allow the witness to repeat testimony elicited on direct examination.|$|E

5000|$|During fact-finding {{hearings}} held {{around the}} state beginning on July 9 in New York City, Cockran used his considerable skills as a <b>cross-examiner</b> and orator to attack Brown, Edison, and their supporters. His strategy was to show that Brown had falsified his test on the killing power of AC and to prove that electricity would not cause certain death and simply lead to torturing the condemned. In cross examination he questioned Brown's lack of credentials in the electrical field and brought up possible collusion between Brown and Edison, which Brown again denied. Many witnesses were called by both sides to give firsthand anecdotal accounts on encounters with electricity and evidence was given by medical professionals on the human body's nervous system and the electrical conductivity of skin. Brown was accused of fudging his tests on animals, hiding {{the fact that he}} was using lower amperage DC and high amperage AC. When the hearing convened for a day at Edison's West Orange lab to witness demonstrations of skin resistance to electricity, Brown almost got in a fight with a Westinghouse representative, accusing him of being in the Edison laboratory to conduct industrial espionage. Newspapers noted the often contradictory testimony was raising public doubts about the electrocution law but after Edison took the stand many accepted assurances from the [...] "wizard of Menlo Park" [...] that 1000 volts of AC would easily kill any man.|$|E

40|$|Part 1 : The {{discourse}} of forensic contextsIn an adversarial common-law courtroom, where one party tries {{to defeat the}} other by using words as weapons, polysemous words {{more often than not}} pose a problem to the court interpreter.
