5|$|The Due Process <b>Clause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fourteenth Amendment {{applies only}} against the states, {{but it is}} {{otherwise}} textually identical to the Due Process <b>Clause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fifth Amendment, which applies against the federal government; both clauses have been interpreted to encompass identical doctrines of procedural due process and substantive due process. Procedural due process is the guarantee of a fair legal process when the government tries to interfere with a person's protected interests in life, liberty, or property, and substantive due process is the guarantee that the fundamental rights of citizens will not be encroached on by government. The Due Process <b>Clause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fourteenth Amendment also incorporates most of the provisions in the Bill of Rights, which were originally applied against only the federal government, and applies them against the states.|$|E

5|$|The Vicinage clause has {{its roots}} in medieval English {{criminal}} procedure, the perceived abuses of criminal vicinage and venue during the colonial period and Anti-federalist objections to the United States Constitution.

5|$|A second {{important}} decision in which Owsley was a participant {{was the case}} of Blair, etc. v. Williams, which invalidated the Kentucky Replevin Act of 1820.

Owsley and his colleagues opined that this law was in violation of the Contract <b>Clause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Constitution. The decision was extremely unpopular with the Commonwealth's citizens, but it was re-affirmed by the court's opinion in the related case of Lapsley v. Brashcars and Barr.|$|E

5|$|English syntax {{relies on}} {{auxiliary}} verbs for many functions including {{the expression of}} tense, aspect and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate <b>clause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> auxiliary verb. For example, in the sentence the dog did not find its bone, the clause find its bone is the complement of the negated verb did not. Subject–auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} country's history, {{voluntary}} acquisition {{or exercise}} of a foreign citizenship was considered sufficient cause for revocation of national citizenship. This concept was enshrined {{in a series of}} treaties between the United States and other countries (the Bancroft Treaties). However, the Supreme Court repudiated this concept in Afroyim v. Rusk (1967), as well as Vance v. Terrazas (1980), holding that the Citizenship <b>Clause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fourteenth Amendment barred the Congress from revoking citizenship. However, Congress can revoke citizenship that it had previously granted to a person not born in the United States.|$|E

Therefore, under federal law violators are prosecuted because the Commerce <b>Clause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States Constitution grants the federal government jurisdiction to prosecute marijuana offenses, here defendants violation of the U.S. Controlled Substances Act.|$|E
5|$|In 1803 Harrison asked Congress {{to suspend}} the anti-slavery <b>clause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northwest Ordinance for ten years. Harrison claimed it was {{necessary}} to increase the territory's population more quickly and attract new settlers. Congress wanted the territory to become economically viable so that the federal government would not longer have to financially support it. In 1803 the entire territory's population numbered less than 5,000. That year the legislature—which was appointed by Harrison—passed legislation reintroducing indentured servitude.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} produce a Horn instance, no two {{variables}} that appear in the same <b>clause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> renamable Horn instance should appear positively in that clause; this constraint {{on a pair of}} variables is a 2-satisfiability constraint. By finding a satisfying assignment to the resulting 2-satisfiability instance, Lewis shows how to turn any renamable Horn instance into a Horn instance in polynomial time. By breaking up long clauses into multiple smaller clauses, and applying a linear-time 2-satisfiability algorithm, it is possible to reduce this to linear time.|$|E

5|$|The Bill of Rights was {{originally}} proposed to assuage Anti-Federalist opposition to Constitutional ratification. Initially, the First Amendment {{applied only to}} laws enacted by the Congress, {{and many of its}} provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today. Beginning with Gitlow v.

5|$|The Marshall Court also issued {{important}} opinions regarding criminal procedure. Although the Court did {{not explicitly}} cite or quote constitutional provisions, its opinions remain influential {{in interpreting the}} Double Jeopardy <b>Clause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fifth Amendment and venue provision of Article Three.

5|$|The Marshall Court possessed {{jurisdiction}} {{in criminal cases}} only via writs of error from state courts, original writs of habeas corpus, and certificates of division from the circuit courts.
