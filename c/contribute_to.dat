5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the self-stability of {{traditional}} bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork, and the handlebar. If the center of mass for the steering mechanism {{is in front of}} the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the center of mass and the elevation of the center of mass also <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E
