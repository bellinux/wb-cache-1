The global markets for Ottoman goods fell somewhat with certain sectors expanding. However, any changes were compensated {{by an increase}} in domestic <b>consumption</b> <b>and</b> <b>demand.</b> Mechanized production even at its peak remained an insignificant portion of total output. The lack of capital, as {{in other areas of the}} economy, deterred the mechanization of production. Nonetheless, a number of factories did emerge in Istanbul, Ottoman Europe and Anatolia. In the 1830s steam powered silk reeling factories emerged in Salonica, Edirne, West Anatolia and Lebanon.|$|E
50|$|Spurred by the Roman acquisition, elite <b>consumption</b> <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> for Greek art, both Greek and Roman artists, {{particularly}} after {{the establishment of}} Roman Greece, sought to reproduce the marble and bronze artworks of the Classical and Hellenistic periods. They did so by creating molds of original sculptures, producing plaster casts that could be sent to any sculptor's workshop of the Mediterranean where these works of art could be duplicated. These were often faithful reproductions of originals, yet other times they fused several elements of various artworks into one group, or simply added Roman portraiture heads to preexisting athletic Greek bodies.|$|E
50|$|It {{is hard to}} {{tell the}} extent the Olympics {{impacted}} the unemployment rates in Utah, due mostly to the impact of the early 2000s recession. In 1996 the unemployment rate in Utah was approximately 3.4% while the US national average was 5.4% {{and by the end of}} 2001 while the national average had risen to 5.7% Utah was around 4.8%. There was a high percentage of visitors which raised the number of tourists for the games whose <b>consumption</b> <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> prompted the establishment of job opportunities to meet the demands.

50|$|Following the House vote, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped over 777 {{points in}} a single day, its largest single-day point drop ever. The $1.2 {{trillion}} loss in market value received much media attention, although it still does not rank among the index's ten largest drops in percentage terms. The S & P lost 8.8%, its seventh worst day in percentage terms and its worst day since Black Monday in 1987. The NASDAQ composite also had its worst day since Black Monday, losing 9.1% in its third worst day ever. The TED spread, {{the difference between what}} banks charge each other for a three-month loan and what the Treasury charges, hit a 26-year high of 3.58%; a higher rate for inter bank loans than Treasury loans is a sign that banks fear that their fellow banks won't be able to pay off their debts. Meanwhile, the price of U.S. light crude oil for November delivery fell $10.52 to $96.37 a barrel, its second largest one-day drop ever, on expectations of an economic slowdown reducing oil <b>consumption</b> <b>and</b> <b>demand.</b> The Dow Jones industrial average recovered 485 points or about 62% of the entire loss the very next day.|$|E

Climate changeinduced temperature increases may exacerbate existing stresses on this system. Detailed recent data are used to estimate the relationships between temperature <b>and</b> both electricity <b>consumption</b> <b>and</b> peak <b>demand</b> at a sample of locations around California. These results are combined with new projections of regional climate change affecting California obtained by statistically downscaling recent global projections generated by two general circulation models, to yield estimates of potential impacts of future temperature changes on electricity <b>consumption</b> <b>and</b> peak <b>demand,</b> <b>and</b> illustrative economic cost estimates in several cases. Both current and prospective coping strategies, and priorities for further research, are summarized. ...|$|R

Two versions of the model are contemplated, one with a fully functioning financial market and the other in its absence. The comparative dynamics of the <b>consumption</b> <b>and</b> health-investment <b>demand</b> functions are studied in both models in a general setting, where it is shown that the key to deriving refutable results is to determine how a parameter or state variable affects the lifetime marginal utilities of health and wealth.

40|$|There {{are many}} factors that drive energy <b>consumption</b> <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> in {{high-rise}} commercial office buildings. Understanding {{the effects of}} individual building parameters and two-factor interactions can be very useful for directing building audits, developing energy simulation models, and for building science research in general. In an effort to expedite building audit processes and energy model development, the work presented in this thesis offers strategies and best practices for efficiently conducting audits and developing building energy models. In conjunction, a fractional factorial analysis (FFA) was conducted to evaluate {{a large number of}} building parameters in an effort to quantify their effect on energy <b>consumption</b> <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> associated with the chiller, HVAC system, and the facility as a whole. The FFA utilized building data collected from twenty-two building audits of high-rise commercial office buildings located in the downtown Chicago Loop area. Data from these buildings were used to determine base and test values for each factor that was evaluated. Simulation results show the effects of each factor and two-factor interactions on energy <b>consumption</b> <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> over a set of climate zones. They also show that there is a particular sub-set of driving factors that are of primary importance. These factors include chiller COP, supply fan pressure rise, the window solar heat gain coefficient and U-value, and lighting and equipment power density. Similarly, the two-factor interaction study identified factors that {{have a significant effect on}} building energy when paired with another factor. The two-factor interactions with high significance included the thermal mass associated with both structural components and interior furnishings paired with one of the driving factors listed above. From these results, a better understanding of the effects and interactions of building parameters on energy <b>consumption</b> <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> was obtained, and recommendations were made to help accelerate building audit and energy model development processes...|$|E
