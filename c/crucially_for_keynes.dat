5|$|Keynesian {{principles}} fared increasingly {{poorly on}} the practical side of economics – by 1979 {{they had been}} displaced by monetarism as the primary influence on Anglo-American economic policy. However, many officials {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic retained a preference <b>for</b> <b>Keynes,</b> and in 1984 the Federal Reserve officially discarded monetarism, after which Keynesian principles made a partial comeback as an influence on policy making.|$|R
50|$|Keynes' concept {{stems from}} 1936 when he {{proposed}} that a transaction tax should be levied on dealings on Wall Street, where {{he argued that}} excessive speculation by uninformed financial traders increased volatility. <b>For</b> <b>Keynes</b> (who was himself a speculator) the key issue was the proportion of 'speculators' in the market, and his concern that, if left unchecked, these types of players would become too dominant.|$|R
