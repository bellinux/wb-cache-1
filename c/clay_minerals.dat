These rocks contain amphibole, <b>clay</b> <b>minerals</b> such as illite, kaolinite and smectite, feldspar, plagioclase, potassium feldspar, pyroxene and quartz.

5|$|Geophagy, the {{practice}} of eating soil or rock, has been observed in orangutans. There are three main reasons for this dietary behaviour: for the addition of mineral nutrients to their diet; for the ingestion of <b>clay</b> <b>minerals</b> that can absorb toxic substances; or to treat a disorder such as diarrhoea. Orangutans also use plants of the genus Commelina as an anti-inflammatory balm.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{isotopes}} fractionate substantially {{during a}} wide variety of natural processes, including mineral formation (chemical precipitation), metabolism, and ion exchange. Lithium ions substitute for magnesium and iron in octahedral sites in <b>clay</b> <b>minerals,</b> where 6Li is preferred to 7Li, resulting in enrichment of the light isotope in processes of hyperfiltration and rock alteration. The exotic 11Li is known to exhibit a nuclear halo. The process known as laser isotope separation can be used to separate lithium isotopes, in particular 7Li from 6Li.|$|E

40|$|<b>Clay</b> <b>mineral</b> {{diagenesis}} of Carboniferous to Paleogene rocks {{within the}} Alpine-Dinaric junction was studied and compared to vitrinite reflectance. Generally, {{there is a}} good fit between <b>clay</b> <b>mineral</b> diagenesis and VR. However, <b>clay</b> <b>mineral</b> alterations lag behindmaturation in some Ladinian and Carnian rocks (e. g. northern margin of the Dinaric Platform). Most probably, the lag in <b>clay</b> <b>mineral</b> diagenesis reflects an highly varying geochemical background in these stratigraphic horizons. Carboniferous deposits are late diagenetic to anchimetamorphic. Mesozoic deposits cover the range from middle diagenesis to the anchizone. Triassic to Cretaceous rocks in the SB and the Sava Folds reach the anchizone. Differences in diagenesis/metamorphism are mainly due to different maximumburial in Paleogene time...|$|R
30|$|Impact of <b>clay</b> <b>mineral</b> {{contents}} on {{the formation}} damage of sandstone rock on injection {{of water or}} HCl was assessed using core flooding, NMR, and SEM analysis. The experiments were conducted using three different types of sandstone rocks (Bandera grey, Berea, and Bandera brown) that contain different <b>clay</b> <b>mineral</b> contents. It was found that <b>clay</b> <b>mineral</b> types and contents {{have a major impact}} on the formation damage when water or HCl was injected with damaging fluids. The change in the pore system depends mainly on the <b>clay</b> <b>mineral</b> presence in the sample and the way it will react with the injected fluid. The permeability measurement showed the reduction in permeability after the damage induced. The reduction in permeability varied by the variation of the sample and the injected fluid.|$|R
5|$|The {{population}} of Gaza depends on groundwater {{as the only}} source for drinking, agricultural use, and domestic supply. The nearest stream is Wadi Ghazza to the south, sourced from Abu Middein along the coastline. It bears {{a small amount of}} water during the winter and virtually no water during the summer. Most of its water supply is diverted into Israel. The Gaza Aquifer along the coast is the main aquifer in the Gaza Strip and it consists mostly of Pleistocene sandstones. Like most of the Gaza Strip, Gaza is covered by quaternary soil; <b>clay</b> <b>minerals</b> in the soil absorb many organic and inorganic chemicals which has partially alleviated the extent of groundwater contamination.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the Devonian period (400 Mya) the sea was retreating from the Welsh Basin as the land was thrust up by the collision of land masses, forming a new range of mountains, the Welsh Caledonides. The strata were compressed and deformed, and in places, the <b>clay</b> <b>minerals</b> recrystallised, developing a grain that allowed parallel cleavage, making it easy to split the rocks into thin flat sheets of stone known as slate. In the Carboniferous period (360 to 300 Mya), erosion of the mountains resulted in the formation of sandstones and mudstones. A reinvasion of southern and northeastern parts of Wales by the sea resulted in depositions of limestone, and extensive swamps in South Wales gave rise to peat deposits and the eventual formation of coal measures. Southwestern Wales, in particular, was affected by the Variscan orogeny, a period when continental collisions further south caused complex folding and fracturing of the strata.|$|E

25|$|A {{claystone}} is lithified, and non-fissile mudrock. In {{order for}} a rock {{to be considered a}} claystone, it must consist of up to fifty percent clay, which measures less than 1/256 of a millimeter in particle size. <b>Clay</b> <b>minerals</b> are integral to mudrocks, and represent the first or second most abundant constituent by volume. There are 35 recognized clay mineral species on Earth. They make muds cohesive and plastic, or able to flow. Clay is by far the smallest particles recognized in mudrocks.

25|$|<b>Clay</b> <b>minerals</b> {{typically}} form {{over long}} periods of time as a result of the gradual chemical weathering of rocks, usually silicate-bearing, by low concentrations of carbonic acid and other diluted solvents. These solvents, usually acidic, migrate through the weathering rock after leaching through upper weathered layers. In addition to the weathering process, some <b>clay</b> <b>minerals</b> are formed through hydrothermal activity. There are two types of clay deposits: primary and secondary. Primary clays form as residual deposits in soil and remain at the site of formation. Secondary clays are clays that have been transported from their original location by water erosion and deposited in a new sedimentary deposit. Clay deposits are typically associated with very low energy depositional environments such as large lakes and marine basins.|$|E
25|$|Minerals {{produced}} through {{hydrothermal alteration}} and weathering of primary basaltic minerals are also present on Mars. Secondary minerals include hematite, phyllosilicates (<b>clay</b> <b>minerals),</b> goethite, jarosite, iron sulfate minerals, opaline silica, and gypsum.

40|$|Abstract [...] A {{method of}} <b>clay</b> <b>mineral</b> sample {{preparation}} for electron microprobe analysis has been devel-oped {{in which a}} film of clay plus 10 - 12 wt. % colloidal graphite isdeposited on a porous ceramic disc using a specially designed suction device. Correction procedures are used to obtain quantitative elemental nal-yses representing the average chemical composition ofthe prepared sample. A statistical technique isem-ployed to estimate the most likely proportions ofclay minerals representing the known composition. Chem-ical compositions ofclay minerals are presented in terms of five coordinates ("Si, " "Al, " "Mg, " "K," and "Fe"). Using literature data, the chemical compositions of 13 different <b>clay</b> <b>mineral</b> groupings were defined statistically by their multivariate means and variance-covariance matrices. A correlation param-eter, X ~, was calculated to compare the chemical composition ofa sample with that of any mixture of the defined <b>clay</b> <b>mineral</b> groupings, the minimum X ~ indicating the best-fit mixture. From chemical analyses of artificial mixtures only approximate day mineral proportions could be deter-mined when the various <b>clay</b> <b>mineral</b> groupings had been defined statistically from literature analyses. The best results were obtained when the actual compositions ofthe end-members forming the artificial mixtures replaced the statistical definitions.

40|$|The <b>clay</b> <b>mineral</b> {{distribution}} in sediments between Indonesia and NW Australia has been assessed {{on the basis}} of 166 core-top samples. <b>Clay</b> <b>mineral</b> assemblages are closely related to the geology and weathering regime of the adjacent hinterland and allow the distinction of four <b>clay</b> <b>mineral</b> provinces.

Illite is the major <b>clay</b> <b>mineral</b> of the Western and eastern Province, whereas the Central Province abounds with smectite. The fourth province comprises the NW and West-Australian shelf and slope, as well as offshore plateaus and is dominated by kaolinite. Transport of clays by surface and subsurface ocean currents can be observed within the provinces, e. g. with the Leeuwin and West Australian Current in the NW Australian Province and with the outflow of low-salinity water through the Sunda and Lombok straits in the Central Province.
