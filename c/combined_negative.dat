40|$|This Review {{summarizes}} {{the natural history}} studies on multiple sclerosis (MS) that have evaluated prognostic factors. Reassessment of prognostic factors is warranted, as our ability to offer patients a reliable prognosis is limited, yet we rely on this knowledge to appropriately design clinical trials and interpret their results. The selection criteria for studies to review included a geographical referral base, duration of at least 9 years, prospective design, and populations of at least 100 patients with MS. For all forms of MS <b>combined,</b> <b>negative</b> prognostic factors included progressive disease, and disability at 2 and 5 years. In relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS) <b>combined,</b> <b>negative</b> prognostic factors were the onset of progression, a higher relapse rate, greater disability in the first 5 years, a shorter interval to the second relapse, and the involvement of more systems. Additional negative factors include a shorter time to progression in SPMS and a faster rate of disability in the first 2 and 5 years in primary progressive MS (PPMS). Onset of progression, relapse rate and disability in the initial 5 years could be fruitful therapeutic targets; however, longer-term clinical trials {{will be required to}} justify these end points...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to <b>combine</b> <b>negative</b> air ions and {{mechanical}} filters to remove indoor suspended particulates. Various factors, including the particle size, the face velocity, the species of aerosol, relative humidity, and the concentration of negative ions were considered to evaluate their effects on the aerosol collection characteristics. Experimental {{results show that the}} aerosol penetration through the mechanical filter without negative air ions (NAI) is higher than that through the mechanical filter with 2 × 104, 1 × 105, and 2 × 105 NAI/cm 3. This finding implies that the removal efficiency of the aerosol by <b>combining</b> <b>negative</b> ions with mechanical filter would be increased. The results also indicate that the variation of the aerosol penetration through the mechanical filter with NAI increased with the aerosol size. That is due to that the aerosol was easier to be charged when aerosol size was getting larger. Moreover, the aerosol penetration decreased with the NAI concentration increasing. The aerosol penetration through the mechanical filter with NAI increased with the face velocity and relative humidity. The filters with NAI performed better against solid aerosol than against liquid aerosol...|$|R

These results are correlated with temporal changes in sea-surface temperature from a long-term monitoring station. The maximum height of N. lapillus shells has declined by approximately 18 mm over the past 100 years, and the median size of shells in large size classes declined by 6 mm during this time.

40|$|The wide {{geographical}} distribution of ground beetles Pterostichus oblongopunctatus makes them {{very likely to}} be exposed to several environmental stressors at the same time.

Our previous studies demonstrated that the combined effect of nickel (Ni) and chlorpyrifos (CHP) was temperature (T) -dependent in adult P-oblongopunctatus. Frequently the different developmental stages of an organism are differently sensitive to single stressors, and for a number of reasons, such as differences in exposure routes, their interactions may also take different forms. Because of this, we studied the effects of the same factors on the beetle larvae. The results showed that all factors, as well as their interactions, influenced larvae survival. The synergistic effect of Ni and CPF was temperature-dependent and the effect of Ni x T interaction on the proportion of emerged imagines indicated stronger toxicity of Ni at 25 degrees C than at 10 degrees C. <b>Combined</b> <b>negative</b> effects of nickel and chlorpyrifos on carabid beetles depend on ambient temperature...|$|E
