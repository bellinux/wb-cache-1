Among them, the beetles are considered important economically, {{not only for the}} actual damages to the stand, but mainly for the difficulty of control. This work aimed to carry out a population survey of insects, mainly of xylophagous, in stands of Tectona grandis. Twenty ethanolic traps and 30 wood samples of teak were installed in two stands in the municipalities of Alegre and Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, located in the south of Espírito Santo State, Brazil. After 18 months (January of 2011 to July of 2012) adult insects, pupas and larvae in the existing galleries in wood samples were collected. The collections of the adult insects were carried out monthly in the ethanolic traps. From August of 2011 to May of 2012, it were collected 742 <b>coleopters</b> in the traps, from the families Bostrichidae and Cerambycidae and subfamily Scolytinae, beyond non xylophagous individuals from the families Chrysomelidae, Curculionidae, Elateridae, Lagriidae, Lampyridae, Scarabaeidae and Tenebrionidae.

It is cultivated {{in various states}} of western Asia, North Africa and Europe. In Italy with the increment of immigration the request of coriandrum fresh state (grass cimicina) and powder to seeds are in increase. In Sicilian territory, for estimating the role of pollinators (wild pollinators and bees) in the increment of seeds production of Coriandrum sativum, a triennial surveying has been carried out, comparing three treatments: self-pollination, bees pollination and free pollination.

The second in the series had much success at an international air display in Le Bourget, in Paris, and the third became a full-scale <b>coleopter</b> in its own right, due to numerous improvements and alterations made to the model. The C.450-01 model's maiden flight took place in May 1959. Two months later, while being put through its paces, the single prototype crashed.

Heinkel conducted a series of design studies as part of their Wespe and Lerche programs.

The biological materi-al (78310 specimens) collected from 31 Barber trap batteries (12 traps/battery with concentrated salt solution) was classified from systematical and food re-gimen point of view. Structure and abundance of soil fauna depends on site and stand charac-teristics, level of infestation with defoliators and influence of anthropic factor (pollution, chemical treatments). A special role in maintaining the biocenotical balance is played by preda-tor soil fauna. The most important groups of predators from the studied forests are <b>coleopters</b> from the families Carabidae and Staphylinidae and spiders and mites from orders Aranea and Acarina (genus Eutrombidium).

40|$|The Pyrenean desman (Galemys pyrenaicus) is a small-endangered {{semi-aquatic}} mammal {{endemic to}} the Pyrenean Mountains {{and to the}} northern half of the Iberian Peninsula whose ecology and biology are still poorly known. Its ecological relationships with other semi aquatic mammals like the aquatic shrew (Neomys fodiens) or the European otter (Lutra lutra) are also unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse Pyrenean desman, aquatic shrew and European otter faeces from the same French Pyrenean regions, in order to analyze their respective diets and to detect possible predation or competition patterns among them. To study precisely their diet, we used next-generation sequencing methods (Ion Torrent or Ilumina miseq technologies). We amplified and sequenced a small DNA minibarcode (133 bp) of the COI gene in 445 faeces samples from the three species. In the Pyrenean desman faeces, we were able to identify a large set of prey species with a positive match (more than 98 % of identity with a reference sequence). These species belonged to four orders and eleven families among which Trichoptera and Hydropsychidae were the most frequent, respectively. The aquatic shrew diet evidenced similar aquatic preys as compared to the Pyrenean Desman. However, it also evidenced an important part of terrestrial invertebrates like woodlouse, ants, <b>coleopters</b> or myriapods. The otter diet was mainly constituted of fishes (eg. Cyprinidae, Salmonidae). However, several faeces samples evidenced Pyrenean Desman DNA, strongly suggesting that otter predate Pyrenean Desman in the studied areas. Future studies will be developed on a better sampling from these three species, in order to gain a better knowledge of their local diets and their ecological relationships. Such information is of great importance to propose the best management measures for the conservation of these protected species. Peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|In the US, Hiller Helicopters {{had been}} working on a number of ducted fan flying {{platforms}} originally designed by Charles Zimmerman. After some early successes, the Army demanded a series of changes that continued to increase the size and weight of the platform, which introduced new stability problems. These generally required more size and power to correct, and no satisfactory design came from these efforts. Instead, Hiller approached the Navy with the idea of building a full <b>coleopter</b> design. This emerged as the Hiller VXT-8 which was significantly similar to the SNECMA design, although it used a propeller instead of a jet engine. However, the introduction of turbine-powered helicopters like the UH-1 Huey so significantly improved their performance over piston-powered designs that the Navy lost interest in the VXT-8 in spite of even better estimated performance.

40|$|Pederine, a drug {{extracted}} from the <b>coleopter</b> Paederus fuscipes, inhibits the growth of in vitro cultured cell lines at concentrations {{of the order of}} 1. 5 nanogram/ml. Cytological examination shows a generalized cytotoxic effect. Analysis of macromolecular syntheses by the use of radioactive precursors shows that pederine causes an almost immediate block of protein and DNA synthesis, without affecting RNA synthesis. The effects on the synthesis of the two types of macromolecules remain nearly simultaneous even at the lowest active concentrations of pederine. Studies with cell-free systems show that the drug inhibits protein synthesis, whereas it is ineffective on the DNA-polymerizing activity. It seems, therefore, that the drug acts primarily on the amino acid polymerizing system, and that the effect on DNA is secondary. This idea is strengthened by the observation that puromycin, a specific inhibitor of protein synthesis, also affects promptly DNA synthesis of in vitro cultured cells. Other authors have shown the same phenomenon with a number of inhibitors of protein synthesis; the properties of pederine support, therefore, the view that continuous protein synthesis is necessary for the maintenance of DNA replication in higher organisms...|$|E
