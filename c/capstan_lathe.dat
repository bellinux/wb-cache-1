50|$|There is a {{tremendous}} variety of turret lathe and <b>capstan</b> <b>lathe</b> designs, reflecting the variety of work that they do.|$|E
50|$|From 1981 to 1985, Magomedemin was a mechanic, a <b>capstan</b> <b>lathe</b> operator, a {{production}} supervisor No.1 of shop No.11 (which {{was released by}} the deputy secretary), and the committee of Komsomol (with the rights of a district committee).|$|E
50|$|The company {{headquarters}} were in {{an early}} 16th-century Priory building in Dursley. In the nearby valley was located a foundry, together {{with a number of}} other workshops necessary for the production of engines and the various other products offered, including a machining shop, <b>capstan</b> <b>lathe</b> shop, engine assembly lines, and a coopers' shop. Many goods were shipped out from the nearby Dursley railway station, which was located on land leased from Lister.|$|E
50|$|The {{machine shop}} has turret <b>lathes,</b> <b>capstan</b> <b>lathes,</b> CNC lathes, and other machine tools.|$|R
5|$|Initially {{the local}} {{authority}} promised to build 1,000 new houses {{to accommodate the}} workforce {{by the end of}} 1938, but by February 1939 it had only awarded a contract for 100. Hives was incensed by this complacency and threatened to move the whole operation, but timely intervention by the Air Ministry improved the situation. In 1940 a strike took place when women replaced men on <b>capstan</b> <b>lathes,</b> the workers' union insisting this was a skilled labour job; however, the men returned to work after 10 days.|$|R
5000|$|Turret <b>lathes</b> and <b>capstan</b> <b>lathes</b> {{are members}} of a class of lathes that are used for {{repetitive}} production of duplicate parts (which by the nature of their cutting process are usually interchangeable). It evolved from earlier lathes with the addition of the turret, which is an indexable toolholder that allows multiple cutting operations to be performed, each with a different cutting tool, in easy, rapid succession, with no need for the operator to perform setup tasks in between (such as installing or uninstalling tools) nor to control the toolpath. (The latter is due to the toolpath's being controlled by the machine, either in jig-like fashion the mechanical limits placed on it by the turret's slide and stops or via IT-directed servomechanisms computer numerical controlled.) ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{cases of}} {{extensive}} squamous {{carcinoma of the}} scrotum are described in men who were working together as <b>capstan</b> <b>lathe</b> setters in the same workshop. The incidence of cancer of the skin is discussed with special reference to workers outside the cotton industry, {{and the importance of}} periodic medical examination of persons in contact with mineral oil is emphasized...|$|E
5000|$|Initially {{apprentices}} typically spent 3 to 4 months {{working on}} production lines producing components for radios and TV’s such as transformers, deflection coils, printed circuit boards, 13 channel tuners {{and various other}} sub-assemblies. These departments predominately employed women between 16 and 60 years old, {{many of whom were}} bussed daily to the factory from the surrounding Cambridgeshire villages. Further time was spent in the machine shop operating power presses, fly presses, and <b>capstan</b> <b>lathes.</b> Some apprentices spent time in the toolroom, others in the maintenance department helping senior engineers maintain the plant and equipment throughout the factory. In the later stages of their apprenticeship, apprentices might spend {{six months to a year}} in research departments, the ‘model shop’, the drawing office or at other Pye facilities which allowed or encouraged original thought. The Pye [...] "Service Centre" [...] in Cambridge as well as Centres in Glasgow and Edinburgh also provided hands on expericence with the help of experienced technicians.|$|R
50|$|H W Ward and Company Ltd {{moved to}} Dale Road c1914. They were very {{significant}} producers of <b>capstan</b> and turret <b>lathes.</b> The buildings were demolished {{to make way}} for the new road and Halls of Residence for students at the University of Birmingham.|$|R
5000|$|The word [...] "capstan" [...] could logically seem {{to refer}} to the turret itself, and to have been {{inspired}} by the nautical <b>capstan.</b> A <b>lathe</b> turret with tools mounted in it can very much resemble a nautical capstan full of handspikes. This interpretation would lead Americans to treat [...] "capstan" [...] as a synonym of [...] "turret" [...] and [...] "capstan lathe" [...] as a synonym of [...] "turret lathe". However, the multi-spoked handles that the operator uses to advance the slide are also called capstans, and they themselves also resemble the nautical capstan.|$|R
