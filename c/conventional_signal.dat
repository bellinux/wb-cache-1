40|$|<b>Conventional</b> <b>signals</b> impose {{costs on}} senders through {{receiver}} retaliation {{rather than through}} investment in signal production. While several visual <b>conventional</b> <b>signals</b> have been described (mainly 'badges of status'), acoustic examples are rare; however, several aspects of repertoire use in songbirds are potential candidates. We performed interactive playback experiments to determine whether song-type matches (responding to a song with the same song type), repertoire matches (responding to a song with a different song type, but one in the repertoires of both singers) and unshared song types serve as <b>conventional</b> <b>signals</b> during male-male territorial interactions in banded wrens, Thryothorus pleurostictus. Our results demonstrate that these three signals incite varying levels of receiver aggression: song-type matches induce faster approach than do repertoire matches, and repertoire matches induce faster approach than do unshared song types. Production costs do not differ, while the receiver response does. Because territorial banded wrens approach opponents who signal aggressively, such opponents risk attack. This system will punish and prevent cheaters, as weak males signalling aggression {{will be subject to}} escalation by stronger or more-motivated opponents...|$|R

The reference signal is encoded on an F3 subcarrier (colour). The navigation variable signal is encoded by mechanically or electrically rotating a directional, , antenna to produce A3 modulation (grey-scale). Receivers (paired colour and grey-scale trace) {{in different directions}} from the station paint a different alignment of F3 and A3 demodulated signal.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the open}} line, the train set runs with the LZB in-cab signalling, where available. Due to {{technical}} restrictions, however, the train cannot depart on LZB after reversing in Allersberg, as the earliest possible entry {{point to the}} LZB signalling {{is located on the}} open line north of the station, at km 23. For that reason, the train has to wait at Allersberg until the next <b>conventional</b> <b>signal,</b> which is located about 15 km down the line on the Reichswald branch, has cleared. If the Allersberg-Express allows an ICE to pass, it therefore takes a minimum wait of four minutes before the train can depart.|$|E

5000|$|Some of Hurd's most cited papers {{deal with}} the {{evolution}} of mating displays, specifically the idea that sexually selected traits have evolved to exploit previously existing biases in the sensory, or recognition, systems of their receivers, rather than being handicapped displays [...] Hurd has argued against the handicap principle view of animal communication, demonstrating the evolutionary stability of conventional (non-handicap) threat displays using game theoretical models. [...] Adding empirical support to this theoretical work, Hurd has also argued that threat displays in birds, and headbob displays in the lizard Anolis carolinensis are <b>conventional</b> <b>signals,</b> rather than handicaps.

The signals with N samples are classified based on frequency components. The comparison is carried out based on degree of freedom the signal detection regions in an N-dimensional signal space. As a result, the MLNN has higher degree of freedom, and can provide more flexible performance for classifying the signals than the conventional methods. This analysis is further investigated throught computer simulations. Multi-frequency signals and the real application, a dial tone receiver, are taken into account.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} to use {{superposition}} signaling {{in which all}} sensors are simultaneously operating and the aggregate of the sensors' signals are acquired by the fusion center to increase communication rate compared to <b>conventional</b> <b>signalling.</b> In addition to superposition signaling, we also propose to employ multiple antennas at the fusion center to improve the data rate of the wireless sensor network further, which will be referred as fusion center diversity (FCD). We derive the optimal likelihood ratio test (LRT) based fusion rule for the superposition signaling with FCD. We finally quantify the detection performance of the optimal fusion rule of the superposition signaling with FCD {{with respect to the}} performance of the <b>conventional</b> <b>signaling</b> fusion rule. Simulation results suggest that the superposition signaling with FCD can provide up to 175 % detection performance over the existing signaling fusion rule...|$|R
40|$|The {{handicap}} theory, {{in which}} the cost of waste guarantees honest advertising, is being used increasingly in {{solutions to the problems}} of biological signal evolution. The ability of the handicap theory to explain the design of signals has never been properly tested. The authors test its ability to explain signal design features in warning coloration and mimicry. Since a full handicap model proves immediately unrealistic, they modify the model to incorporate realistic assumptions about predator learning. Using this model they explicitly compare the handicap theory with a purely "conventional' signalling model and with a null model. Predictions relating to three key design features (conspicuousness, pattern similarity, and Batesian minmicry) are compared, and tested against available data. Although many predictions remain to be tested adequately, the authors conclude that: 1) conspicuousness is most plausibly explained by the <b>conventional</b> <b>signalling</b> theory that ascribes the function of conspicuous coloration to signal efficacy rather than waste; 2) pattern similarity, within and between species, is unlikely {{to be the result of}} the need to produce similar degrees of conspicuousness, as predicted by the handicap theory, but is plausibly explained as the result of pattern generalization amongst discriminating predators, as predicted by the <b>conventional</b> <b>signalling</b> theory; and 3) Batesian mimicry is predicted by the <b>conventional</b> <b>signalling</b> theory, but not the handicap theory. The handicap theory thus fails to provide an adequate explanation of the main design features of at least one major signalling system. -from Author...|$|R
