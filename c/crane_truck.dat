40|$|Abstract: To more {{accurately}} learn reliability on anti-overturning stability for a <b>truck</b> <b>crane,</b> a parametric multi-body dynamics model is {{built in a}} dynamic software environment with overall key parameters as design variables. On this basis, stability criteria of this <b>truck</b> <b>crane</b> are established according to the working conditions and crane dynamics simulation results. After a truncated normal distribution sampling method is given for design variables which will effect on <b>truck</b> <b>crane's</b> stability, the reliability analysis of this <b>truck</b> <b>crane</b> is done via Monte Carlo method. The result indicates that the <b>truck</b> <b>crane's</b> stability reliability is 0. 9998 in the most dangerous working condition. Analysis shows that the reliability calculation of <b>truck</b> <b>crane</b> anti-overturning stability is feasible using modern multi-body dynamics and Monte Carlo method, {{and the results are}} more accurate than conventional safety factor method...|$|R

40|$|Ports are a {{major source}} of {{economic}} activity and environmental pollution. They use a variety of equipment for loading/unloading and movement of cargo, such as marine vessels, <b>cranes,</b> <b>trucks</b> and railroads. These activities can cause large amounts of pollution to the air, water and soil me-dia. Despite the pollution generated, it also serves as a medium for tourism with its cruise liners. This paper discusses port activities and how it effects the environment. The main focus of this pa-per is Knowledge Sharing for Sustainability of Ports. Sustainability indicators should help in eva-luating port conditions and this knowledge sharing among the proposed 10 major world ports should accelerate economic growth and use of latest technologies for pollution reduction...|$|R

The technologies adopted in terms of architecture and installation were very effective in creating a mobile laboratory open to further extension by online interoperation with other simulators and with biomedical devices for assessing human capabilities within this framework.

It was based on a large International truck fitted with a metal crane, hook and pulley, and painted in the traditional Chipperfield's Circus livery of red and blue, as were all the models in the range. It was followed by the Circus Animal Cage Trailer (1123) in January 1961 which featured two two-part opening doors revealing a large cage with metal bars. These two models were later packaged together as the Chipperfield's Circus Set (GS12). An updated version of the Karrier Bantam Mobile Butcher Shop was introduced in January 1962 as the Circus Booking Office (426). The window insert of the original depicting joints of meat was replaced with a new one with circus advertising posters. In April 1962 the existing Land Rover 109 model was issued along with a trailer carrying a large cage and a model elephant as Chipperfield's Circus Land Rover and Elephant Cage on Trailer (GS19).|$|E
5000|$|The Tokyo Metropolitan Police later {{come and}} take Curaçao into custody, {{transferring}} her to the Police Hospital, but {{they are forced to}} surrender her to the PSB as the Bureau believes Curaçao was the spy infiltrating the Bureau Office the day before. The Bureau becomes aware that Curaçao appears to react to certain events in the Tohto Aquarium, and decides to take her back to the Aquarium. The same night, the Black Organization, who arrived by the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey, knocks out the electricity for the entire aquarium and plan to intercept Curaçao when the ferris wheel reaches the top. After Curaçao regains her memory by looking at the specific color patterns of the projected lights like she did earlier before, Yuya Kazami, who boarded the ferris wheel with her, is knocked unconscious by her and she escapes. The Black Organization attempts to detonate the bomb planted at the ferris wheel, but the bomb is disarmed by Rei after he is informed of its existence through Conan. The organization then change plans and instead fire from the V-22, trying to kill Curaçao and destabilize the wheel so that it will fall and roll. Akai, with the help of Conan and Rei, are able to shoot down the V-22, and Conan attempts to stop the rolling wheel before it crushes to the aquarium. Curaçao, having noticed that the Detective Boys are in the rolling ferris wheel, crash a <b>crane</b> <b>truck</b> into the wheel, stopping it and saving the Detective Boys but her actions cause the ferris wheel to crush her to death. Before her death, Curaçao admits to Vermouth that the mail tampered by Conan and sent from her broken cell phone that reads [...] "Bourbon and Kir are clean" [...] was sent on her own; thus the two are able to maintain their cover in the Black Organization.|$|E
50|$|The Major range {{continued}} into the 1970s but along with the Corgi Toys range suffered somewhat from the constraints on development budgets {{that the company was}} forced to make. The Mercedes-Benz Unimog and snowplough (1150) was released in February 1971 and another American cab unit was introduced in October 1971. The new Mack was coupled with a fuel tanker in the livery of 'Esso' (1152) in October 1971 and a Transcontinental trailer (1100) in November 1971, and fitted with an updated version of the Priestman Cub Shovel now converted to become a crane in October 1972 as the Mack Priestman <b>Crane</b> <b>Truck</b> (1154). A new Berliet cab was introduced in May 1974 as the Crane Fruehauf Discharge Dumper (1102), a large articulated aggregate carrier for use on construction sites, and the new cab was also used as the Berliet Wrecker Truck (1144) in March 1975 updating the aforementioned Holmes Wrecker, which had been in the range since 1967. The Pathfinder Airport Crash Truck (1103) released in September 1974 had won the Design Council Engineering Award for its manufacturer Chubb, and the Corgi miniature included an internal water tank allowing water to be squirted through die-cast water cannons by pumping a rubber bulb. Another new cab was introduced in April 1976. The Ford Transcontinental was designed for long range treks across the European continent and was first issued coupled to the fuel tanker previously seen with the earlier Mack cab, also in 'Esso' livery (1157) or 'Gulf' livery (1160), and later in February 1982 in the livery of 'Guinness' (1169). A new Car Transporter (1159) was issued in November 1976 using the new Ford Transcontinental cab, and two more construction site orientated vehicles were issued, the JCB Crawler Loader (1110) in June 1976 and the Volvo BM Concrete Mixer (1156) in January 1977. The Dolphinarium (1164) was issued in April 1980 and featured the Berliet cab and a flatbed trailer which carried a large plastic water tank. Once the tank was filled a plunger attached to a jet nozzle within the tank could be pumped forcing two model dolphins attached to a plastic guide to jump {{out of the water and}} through the air.|$|E

Ultimately, this simulation will serve as a testbed for the evaluation of sensor network data col-lection, fusion and decision making for threat detection in a seaport environ-ment...|$|R
50|$|In October 2012 it was {{announced}} that the 2013 season would be played with eight teams as the Gold Coast Blue Tongues' licence was suspended due to the team being unable to secure a home venue for 2013. The Blue Tongues were forced out of their arena during the 2012 season when the AIHL deemed it to not be up to specifications for the league forcing the team to temporarily relocate to Brisbane {{for the remainder of the}} season. It was also announced that the suspension on the Sydney Ice Dogs had been lifted allowing the team to ice four imports again. The Ice Dogs were restricted to three for the 2012 season by the league due to breaches of the league's code of conduct. Following the Annual General Meeting (AGM) it {{was announced}} that the third period of play has been increased from 15 minutes to 20 minutes, while the first two remain 15 minutes in length. The change was in response to fans calling for the league to align itself with international hockey which plays three 20 minute periods. The Melbourne Mustangs revealed their new logo and jerseys for the start of the season featuring a redesigned mustang horse, holding an ice hockey stick. The new jerseys include a white home jersey, a black away jersey and an orange third jersey which is being released as off-ice apparel only. The Sydney Ice Dogs also revealed their new jerseys with an aqua green away jersey and a white home jersey. The change in colours was made as part of a deal with corporate naming sponsor Reach <b>Crane</b> <b>Trucks</b> and will be in place for three years, the duration of their deal with Reach <b>Crane</b> <b>Trucks.</b> Their previous colours of maroon, yellow, blue, black and white will remain as the team's corporate colours.|$|R
