5000|$|Greece {{is famous}} for, {{especially}} in recent years, always giving twelve points to Cyprus and always receiving twelve points from Cyprus. This {{is one of}} many examples of the bloc voting seen in contest which also occurs between Iberian, Balkan, Scandinavian, ex-Soviet and Baltic countries. In the case of Greece and Cyprus, the exchange of twelve points is probably because the majority of <b>Cypriot</b> <b>citizens</b> are Greeks thus sharing linguistic ties (speaking Greek) and musical taste. Furthermore, Greece and Cyprus share the same music industry. Due to the controversies caused by political voting, two semi-finals were introduced for the 2008 Contest in which Cyprus and Greece were unable to vote for each other in the semi-finals. In the build-up to the 2008 contest, however, the artists representing Greece and Cyprus jointly held a successful warm-up party at the Euroclub, attended by 17 other delegations from the contest and 1500 guests attracted by the promised [...] "confluence of the Greek-Cypriot sound". However, {{for the first time ever}} in 2015 Greece and Cyprus did not give each other 12 points, with Greece giving Cyprus 10 points and Cyprus giving Greece only 8 points, and curiously both countries gave the maximum to Italy.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the views of}} a number of educational actors about the impact of a broad range of educational reforms upon philological Greek Cypriot teachers' professionalism. The empirical component of the study gathers evidence from a variety of educational professionals, and presents data from a series of focus group interviews with philological class teachers, deputy heads and head teachers as well as from a number of individual interviews with professionals in more senior positions such as inspectors, implementers and teacher trainers. The main rationale for the use of a variety of accounts to investigate philological teachers' understanding of their professionalism as well as their responses to past and future educational reforms rests within the need of the study for data triangulation. An extended literature review focuses on the international arena of debate on professionalism, includes a critical discussion of the impact of managerial and neo-liberal educational reforms upon teachers' professional identities. In addition, global as well as economic, political and cultural factors within the Greek Cypriot context are debated in the light of incoming managerial reforms. The thesis' main argument is that, given the historical, cultural and political tensions facing Greek Cypriot education, as well as future challenges, a managerialist approach would fail to provide the reflective and critical perspective that philological teachers need. Such values are highly important for educating Greek <b>Cypriot</b> <b>citizens</b> about the new European and global realities required for a possible future bi-communal and federal Cypriot state. Hence, this thesis calls for a 'discourse-based' ethics and 'reflexive' approach to professionalism, which is used as an ethical compass for repaying attention to what might be lost from teachers' professional repertoire in the aftermath of such reforms.

50|$|Officially, {{the island}} nation Cyprus {{is part of}} the European Union, under the de jure {{sovereignty}} of the Republic of Cyprus. Turkish <b>Cypriots</b> are <b>citizens</b> of the Republic of Cyprus and thus of the European Union, and were entitled to vote in the 2004 European Parliament election (though only a few hundred registered). The EU's acquis communautaire is suspended indefinitely in the northern third of the island, which has remained outside the control of the Republic of Cyprus since the Turkish invasion of 1974. The Greek Cypriot community rejected the Annan Plan for the settlement of the Cyprus dispute in a referendum on 24 April 2004. Had the referendum been in favour of the settlement proposal, the island (excluding the British Sovereign Base Areas) would have joined the European Union as the United Cyprus Republic.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} the mental health of <b>Cypriot</b> <b>citizens</b> living in the current difficult period of economic recession. The specific objective was to investigate the different factors (gender, age, socio-economic factors, etc.) that may affect the levels of emotional distress, anxiety, and depression in patients attending the Rural Health Centre of Kofinou. Materials and Methods: The sample consisted of a total of 300 Cypriots who visited Kofinou Health Centre in the period between July and September 2015. For the middle-aged citizens, the Greek version of the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) was applied to 150 persons [1], while for the visiting senior citizens (aged over 65 years), the Greek version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was used [2]. Results: HADS: A total of 150 people of average age 47 ± 11. 5 years (min 23 –max 64) participated in the study. Fifty-six percent were women. Seventy-seven percent stated they had a reduction in income (mean reduction 35 % ± 25 %) and 46. 7 % suffered from chronic disease. The 36. 6 % and 28. 7 % of the visitors showed moderate or severe forms of anxiety and depression, accordingly. Higher emotional distress is associated with lower educational level (b = − 2. 63, p 35 %) is associated with increased depression (p = 0. 028). GDS: 150 patients out of which 77 were women (51. 3 %). The average age of participants was 72 ± 5. 5 years. Ninety-three (62 %) participants declared a reduction in income due to the financial crisis (mean reduction 20 % ± 8 %), while 139 (92. 7 %) stated that they had chronic disease. Fifty-three participants (35. 3 %) thought they had symptoms of depression after the economic crisis. The women showed higher level of geriatric depression symptoms than men (b = − 1. 96, p = 0. 005), while age is associated with higher levels of GDS (b = 0. 16, p = 0. 006). Conclusions: The study shows that stress levels, depression, and emotional distress are increased in specific population groups. The main variables associated with the mental health of the participants are the presence of a chronic disease, income, and level of education...|$|R
