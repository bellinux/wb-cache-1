30|$|Internet finance is a {{promising}} field, of which <b>credit</b> <b>service</b> is one important pillar. Understanding the {{issues related to}} Internet <b>credit</b> <b>services</b> not only enriches our knowledge to this new phenomenon but also holds the potential of addressing practical problems. Big Data plays {{an essential role in}} many Internet <b>credit</b> <b>service</b> companies’ business. We expect the case study provides some preliminary evidence and opinions that can lead to future research on Internet <b>credit</b> <b>services.</b>|$|R
30|$|Nowadays, {{many private}} <b>credit</b> <b>service</b> {{providers}} in China use {{data collected from}} the Internet and other data sources. Their practices provide {{a good example of}} using Big Data technology to serve the financial industry. In this study, we examine Internet <b>credit</b> <b>services</b> through the practices of 100 Credit (www. 100 credit.com), a new Internet <b>credit</b> <b>service</b> provider in China, with the goal of deepening our understanding of the value of Big Data to Internet <b>credit</b> <b>services.</b>|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we {{inspect the}} {{business}} operations of 100 Credit, an Internet <b>credit</b> <b>service</b> company in China. Internet <b>credit</b> <b>service</b> providers {{make use of}} heterogeneous data collected from multiple sources on people’s online and offline activities to predict their credit rating. We summarize four values Big Data has brought to Internet <b>credit</b> <b>service</b> companies through 100 Credit’s practice, namely, the value from volume, prediction correctness, service variety, and privacy protection. We discuss the unique opportunity that makes Internet <b>credit</b> <b>service</b> possible in China {{and the future of}} this service.|$|R

30|$|The {{analysis}} {{of access to}} <b>credit</b> <b>services</b> received by farmers showed that 75.6 and 24.4 % of the farmers have {{and do not have}} access to <b>credit</b> <b>services</b> respectively. The chi-square result (X 2 [*]=[*] 1.485) of access to <b>credit</b> <b>services</b> is statistically insignificant at the 95 % level of significance. Therefore, there is no relation between access to <b>credit</b> <b>services</b> and farmers’ decision to participate in watershed management programs. This could be because of farmers’ fear about their inability to pay back the credit within the prescribed period of time, which could lead to punishment.|$|R
30|$|Aligned {{with the}} four values of Big Data we argued above, China {{provides}} a unique opportunity for Internet <b>credit</b> <b>services.</b> As compared with developed countries, the <b>credit</b> <b>service</b> in China is relatively amateur. At the same time, China has a rapid developing economy that desperately needs <b>credit</b> <b>services.</b> There is a strong need to reach a larger group of consumers {{in a short period}} of time, which makes the “value of volume” meaningful and significant.|$|R
30|$|We do {{not think}} Internet <b>credit</b> <b>services</b> will {{eventually}} replace traditional <b>credit</b> <b>services.</b> As we know, the most important data in <b>credit</b> <b>services</b> is still financial information (including both cases of bad debts and financial activities that can predict such bad debts). Such data will be protected by the financial industry due to its high value and privacy concerns. Thus, holding such an important data source provides value and a reason for traditional credit services’ existence, mainly to serve consumers with a longer financial history.|$|R

30|$|At {{a country}} level, it is {{necessary}} to study how policies on Internet <b>credit</b> <b>services</b> may affect their operations and the entire economy. For example, it may be subtle to balance {{the pros and cons of}} Internet <b>credit</b> <b>services</b> due to the privacy concern. Making regulations too strict may kill Internet <b>credit</b> <b>service</b> companies. Making regulations too loose may affect the individual benefits. Furthermore, {{it is necessary}} to closely monitor the credit markets to avoid illegal competitions. To answer such questions needs further studies from the policy perspective.|$|R
30|$|According to our argued four {{values of}} Big Data, we would project that Internet <b>credit</b> <b>services</b> {{will play a}} {{supporting}} role to regular <b>credit</b> <b>services</b> in future. With {{the development of the}} economy and the financial industry in China, traditional <b>credit</b> <b>services</b> will get an enlarged set of consumer records. The value of data volume will be reduced and be mainly reflected in “new” consumers to the financial industry, such as borrowers who are young, have a short time on the job or at their residence, and lower income teenagers. In fact, such financially more vulnerable (higher risk categories) borrowers were considered to benefit the most from <b>credit</b> <b>services</b> in previous literature (Barron and Staten 2003). For such consumers, Internet <b>credit</b> <b>services</b> will continue to play a very important role, since it is easier to build a record on the Internet (such as in online gaming, social networking, online reviews) than with financial services. Finance institutes will highly rely on Big Data to build the first mile of their consumers’ credit history.|$|R

30|$|A major {{purpose of}} {{bringing}} <b>credit</b> <b>service</b> to the lending market {{is to improve}} credit assessment accuracy. In traditional <b>credit</b> <b>services,</b> Kallberg and Udell (2003) and Chandler (1992) showed that credit reports provided additional explanation power, compared to data in application forms, for predicting borrowers’ credit risk. For 100 Credit, {{it is necessary to}} address the same problem and provide accurate <b>credit</b> rating <b>service.</b> Otherwise, it cannot survive in the credit rating market.|$|R

We document these comovements and incorporate into a monetary growth model a <b>credit</b> <b>services</b> sector that provides services that help people economize on money. Our model makes two new contributions. First, we show that direct evidence on the appropriately defined <b>credit</b> <b>service</b> sector for the United States {{is consistent with the}} welfare cost measured using an estimated money demand schedule. Second, we provide welfare cost of inflation estimates that have some new features. Inflation (Finance); Welfare...|$|R

30|$|Protecting {{data that}} are matched with identities is more challenging. Such data (either {{accumulated}} from the <b>credit</b> <b>service’s</b> operation or acquired from other companies) is of value to other Internet companies. There is a strong incentive for people getting such data to improve their own models (for crediting rating, recommendation, etc.). Besides, Internet <b>credit</b> <b>service</b> company’s data comes from multiple sources, including user online behaviors. Using such data raises privacy concerns (Belanger and Crossler 2011). 3 After identity matching, the data in Internet <b>credit</b> <b>services</b> can connect multiple aspects of a person, which may reveal deep secrets and lead to strong opposition from users.|$|R

30|$|Due {{to privacy}} concerns, {{we do not}} think Internet <b>credit</b> <b>services</b> will {{eventually}} merge with traditional <b>credit</b> <b>services.</b> Note that online activities and financial histories represent different types of confidential information. Merging them into one organization will create major public concern. Furthermore, according to (Padilla and Pagano 2000), sharing default cases among lenders has a disciplinary effect on borrowers, which will be reduced if other information is also shared. Allowing credit bureaus to hold some powerful financial information will help maintain the disciplinary effect in the finance domain. We {{do not want to}} extend the disciplinary effect to all dimensions of online activities. Two types of <b>credit</b> <b>services</b> serving relatively different market segments may better benefit society.|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} {{to improving the}} credit model, {{it is also possible}} to improve on other aspects of an Internet <b>credit</b> <b>service.</b> From the management perspective, it is worthwhile to understand how improving service level at different dimensions may affect the profit (or utility) of the company. With this knowledge, the Internet <b>credit</b> <b>service</b> company can better allocate their resources on data collection, model development, service improvement, and information protection. More research on this aspect is needed to direct their strategic plan.|$|R
30|$|The need {{to reduce}} {{information}} asymmetry has significant consequences for the operation of <b>credit</b> markets. <b>Credit</b> <b>services</b> are established to serve the market with credit-related information (Barron and Staten 2003). Kohli and Grover (2008) argued {{that the ability to}} generate value from information was an important part of their business. The major purpose of <b>credit</b> <b>services</b> is to generate value from the information on borrowers in the credit market. This is a perfect illustration of the production of valuable information.|$|R

After {{the abolition of the}} Eurocheque, the allocation of ec-cards by the German <b>credit</b> <b>services</b> sector was suspended and the trademarks for Eurocheque were sold to MasterCard.|$|R
