40|$|Abstract: The Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) {{has been}} used to {{determine}} positions for many southern methanol maser sites, with accuracy better than 1 arcsec. The results are presented here as a catalogue of more than 350 distinct sites, some of them new discoveries, and many others with positional precision 10 times better than existing published values. Clusters of 2 or 3 sites are occasionally found to account for single previously listed sources. This in turn reveals that the velocity range for each individual site is sometimes smaller than that of the originally tabulated (blended) source. Only a handful of examples then remain with a velocity range of more than 16 kms − 1 at a single compact (less than 2 arcsec) site. The precise methanol positions now allow apparent coincidences with OH masers to be <b>confidently</b> <b>accepted</b> or rejected; this has led to the important conclusion that, where a 1665 -MHz OH maser lies in a massive star formation region, at more than 80 percent of the OH sites there is a precisely coincident methanol maser. The methanol precision achieved here will also allow clear comparisons with likely associated IR sources when the next generation of far-IR surveys produce precise positions...|$|E

40|$|The waste {{generation}} rate (WGR) is usually {{used as a}} key performance indicator (KPI) to benchmark construction waste management (CWM) performance, {{with a view to}} improving the performance con- tinuously. However, existing researches, for different reasons, only investigated a relatively small amount of construction projects, whose WGRs cannot be <b>confidently</b> <b>accepted</b> as KPIs. This study develops a set of more reliable KPIs/WGRs using an available big dataset on CWM in Hong Kong. By mining the 2, 212, 026 waste disposal records generated from 5764 projects in two consecutive years of 2011 and 2012, the WGRs/KPIs are revisited and refined. Demolition is found the most wasteful works. New building, and maintenance and renovation (M&R) works individually produce the least waste amount but by accumu- lating all M&R works, their contribution to the total amount of construction waste could be phenomenal. Based on the more reliable WGRs from the big data, CWM performance benchmarks for different cate- gories of projects are set up. A contractor can benchmark its CWM performance against its counterparts or its past performance as ‘Good’, ‘Average’, and ‘Not-so-good’, and thus identify better CWM practices that induce superior performance. Based on the benchmarks, the government may consider setting up a WGR-step toll system to encourage those ‘Not-so-good’ contractors to perform well in the future, and initiate incentives to the companies conducting ‘Good’ projects to spur better CWM performance. Overall, the WGRs derived from the big data and more robust analyses provide a very powerful and handy tool for CWM...|$|E
40|$|Arsenic {{concentrations}} were measured in annual rings, pith, bark, and leaves of five tree species (four genera) from a site highly contaminated with As in Vineland, New Jersey, and two nearby uncontaminated areas. The highest As {{concentrations were}} found in bark (0. 68 ± 0. 89  mg/kg, n = 16) and leaves (1. 9 ± 1. 8  mg/kg, n = 4) from the contaminated area. Tree-ring As levels from the contaminated area (0. 28 ± 0. 15  mg/kg, n = 32) were low but still considerably higher than those from the control areas (0. 06 ± 0. 06  mg/kg, n = 30). There is a generally positive relationship between soil and tree-ring As levels. The overall low uptake of As by trees contrasts with that of P, a chemical analog for As(V) in aerated soils. Much higher P concentration in sapwood than in heartwood indicates that P is exported into more recently formed wood during the conversion from sapwood to heartwood; this again is drastically different than the behavior of As which is present in sapwood and heartwood at comparable levels. Variable sapwood As concentrations observed in detailed radial profiles of tree-ring chemistry of a pine and an oak from the contaminated site suggest that As is most likely transported among multiple rings within the sapwood. Therefore, tree species for which sapwood is thin (e. g., oak as in this study) should be preferred for reconstructing the history of contamination of a site. Due {{to the possibility of}} lateral translocation between growth rings, further studies are necessary to understand within-tree As transport and storage before dendrochemistry can be <b>confidently</b> <b>accepted</b> for such applications. © 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|Within a cyber-infrastructure (CI), {{there is}} {{increasing}} collaboration between services as well as increasing use of multiple information sources with different level of quality by these services. This suggests that service results might come from multiple sources including other services. Thus, it is becoming important for CI-based services to provide some mechanism for computing belief recommendations if users are going to accept and use service results. In this paper, we discuss the combined use of provenance information, i. e., information describing how and where the results were derived, and trust relation networks between CI agents to compute belief recommendations. Agents may use these trustbased belief recommendations to build opinions about the trustworthiness of service results and <b>confidently</b> <b>accept,</b> further question or reject them...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{technique}} for enabling computations to survive errors and faults while providing a bound on any resulting output distortion. A developer using the technique first partitions the computation into tasks. The execution platform then simply discards any task that encounters an error or a fault and completes the computation by executing any remaining tasks. This technique can substantially improve the robustness of the computation {{in the face of}} errors and faults. A potential concern is that discarding tasks may change the result that the computation produces. Our technique randomly samples executions of the program at varying task failure rates to obtain a quantitative, probabilistic model that characterizes the distortion of the output {{as a function of the}} task failure rates. By providing probabilistic bounds on the distortion, the model allows users to <b>confidently</b> <b>accept</b> results produced by executions with failures as long as the distortion falls within acceptable bounds. This approach may prove to be especially useful for enabling computations to successfully survive hardware failures in distributed computing environments. Our technique also produces a timing model that characterizes the execution time as a function of the task failure rates. The combination of the distortion and timing models quantifies an accuracy/execution time tradeoff. It therefore enables the development of techniques that purposefully fail tasks to reduce the execution time while keeping the distortion within acceptable bounds. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new technique, early phase termination, for {{eliminating}} idle processors in parallel computations that use barrier synchronization. This technique simply terminates each parallel phase {{as soon as}} there are too few remaining tasks to keep all of the processors busy. Although this technique completely eliminates the idling that would otherwise occur at barrier synchronization points, it may also change the computation and therefore the result that the computation produces. We address this issue by providing probabilistic distortion models that characterize how the use of early phase termination distorts the result that the computation produces. Our experimental results show that for our set of benchmark applications, 1) early phase termination can improve {{the performance of the}} parallel computation, 2) the distortion is small (or can be made to be small with the use of an appropriate compensation technique) and 3) the distortion models provide accurate and tight distortion bounds. These bounds can enable users to evaluate the effect of early phase termination and <b>confidently</b> <b>accept</b> results from parallel computations that use this technique if they find the distortion bounds to be acceptable. Finally, we identify a general computational pattern that works well with early phase termination and explain why computations that exhibit this pattern can tolerate the early termination of parallel tasks without producing unacceptable results...|$|R
60|$|The {{tale of the}} Noble Moringer is {{somewhat}} of the same nature--it exists {{in a collection of}} German popular songs, entitled, Sammlung Deutschen Volkslieder, Berlin, 1807; published by Messrs. Busching and Von der Hagen. The song is supposed to be extracted from a manuscript chronicle of Nicholas Thomann, chaplain to St. Leonard in Wissenhorn, and dated 1533. The ballad, which is popular in Germany, is supposed from the language, to have been composed in the fifteenth century. The Noble Moringer, a powerful baron of Germany, about to set out on a pilgrimage to the land of St. Thomas, with the geography of which we are not made acquainted, resolves to commit his castle, dominions, and lady, to the vassal who should pledge him to keep watch over them till the seven years of his pilgrimage were accomplished. His chamberlain, an elderly and a cautious man, declines the trust, observing, that seven days, instead of seven years, would be the utmost space to which he would consent to pledge himself for the fidelity of any woman. The esquire of the Noble Moringer <b>confidently</b> <b>accepts</b> the trust refused by the chamberlain, and the baron departs on his pilgrimage. The seven years are now elapsed, all save a single day and night, when, behold, a vision descends on the noble pilgrim as he sleeps {{in the land of the}} stranger.|$|R

His date of birth is not known and our knowledge of him depends almost entirely on the evidence of his poetry, of which 28 poems survive. He was a friend of the Anglesey poet Lewys Môn, {{one of the most important}} poets of that period. He probably died in the early 1530s and was buried in Nefyn.|$|R
40|$|Among {{gynecological}} malignancies, {{ovarian cancer}} is the most frequent cause of death. Image mining algorithms have been predominantly used to give the physicians a more objective, fast, and accurate second opinion on the initial diagnosis made from medical images. The objective of this work is to develop an adjunct Computer-Aided Diagnostic (CAD) technique that uses 3 D ultrasound images of the ovary to accurately characterize and classify benign and malignant ovarian tumors. In this algorithm, we first extract features based on the textural changes and higher-order spectra (HOS) information. The significant features are then selected and used to train and evaluate the decision tree (DT) classifier. The proposed technique was validated using 1, 000 benign and 1, 000 malignant images, obtained from ten patients with benign and ten with malignant disease, respectively. On evaluating the classifier with tenfold stratified cross validation, the DT classifier presented a high accuracy of 97 %, sensitivity of 94. 3 %, and specificity of 99. 7 %. This high accuracy was achieved because {{of the use of}} the novel combination of the four features which adequately quantify the subtle changes and the nonlinearities in the pixel intensity variations. The rules output by the DT classifier are comprehensible to the end user and, hence, allow the physicians to more <b>confidently</b> <b>accept</b> the results. The preliminary results show that the features are discriminative enough to yield good accuracy. Moreover, the proposed technique is completely automated and accurate and can be easily written as a software application for use in any computer...|$|R
60|$|Two {{explanations}} {{have been}} suggested to account for these conversions. First, that the parent trees have been in every case hybrids (10/53. Alph. De Candolle 'Geograph. Bot.' page 886.) between the peach and nectarine, and have reverted by bud-variation or by seed {{to one of their}} pure parent forms. This view in itself is not very improbable; for the Mountaineer peach, which was raised by Knight from the red nutmeg-peach by pollen of the violette hative nectarine (10/54. Thompson in Loudon's 'Encyclop. of Gardening' page 911.), produces peaches, but these are said SOMETIMES to partake of the smoothness and flavour of the nectarine. But let it be observed that in the previous list no less than six well-known varieties and several unnamed varieties of the peach have once suddenly produced perfect nectarines by bud variation: and it would be an extremely rash supposition that all these varieties of the peach, which have been cultivated for years in many districts, and which show not a vestige of a mixed parentage, are, nevertheless, hybrids. A second explanation is, that the fruit of the peach has been directly affected by the pollen of the nectarine: although this certainly is possible, it cannot here apply; for we have not a shadow of evidence that a branch which has borne fruit directly affected by foreign pollen is so profoundly modified as afterwards to produce buds which continue to yield fruit of the new and modified form. Now it is known that when a bud on a peach-tree has once borne a nectarine the same branch has in several instances gone on during successive years producing nectarines. The Carclew nectarine, on the other hand, first produced half-and-half fruit, and subsequently pure peaches. Hence we may <b>confidently</b> <b>accept</b> the common view that the nectarine is a variety of the peach, which may be produced either by bud-variation or from seed. In the following chapter many analogous cases of bud-variation will he given.|$|R
40|$|One {{side effect}} of the {{unprecedented}} urbanization in China is {{the large amount of}} building-related construction and demolition (C&D) waste generated during the process. It is an enigma why such statistics as C&D waste generation are absent from the literature in spite of their importance to devising sensible interventions to deal with the C&D waste related problems. This paper aims to estimate the amount of C&D waste at the country level. It does so by adopting a methodology utilizing national statistical data and the average amounts of waste generated at job sites. Furthermore, the estimation is undergone a thorough calibration against various independent sources before it can be <b>accepted</b> <b>confidently.</b> It is finally estimated that approximately 1. 13 billion tons of C&D materials were generated in China during 2014, which has declined from a plateau of building activities and C&D waste generation in the early 2010 s. The paper provides some useful references for devising appropriate C&D waste reduction, reuse, or recycling strategies. The paper also offers useful commentary on methodology to estimate C&D waste generation at an urban level, particularly in situations where data availability is erratic. postprin...|$|R
