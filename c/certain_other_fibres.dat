40|$|The rate of gas {{secretion}} {{into the}} swimbladder of the Atlantic cod Gadus morhua was studied with X-ray measurements of swimbladder size. A direct correlation {{was found between}} the area of the swimbladder in the X-ray photographs and the volume of the swimbladder. Removal of the swimbladder gas stimulates the fish to produce new gas, and the mean rate of refilling of the swimbladder in the cod was found to be 1. 5 ml kg" 1 h" 1 during the first 24 h. The influence of drugs and of vagotomy on the rate of filling was measured. Gas secretion was completely inhibited by vagotomy and partly inhibited by injections of atropine or porcine vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Substance P and VIP both increased the rate of secretion in atropinized fish, while 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) and noradrenaline did not affect the rate of filling in either control or atropinized fish. Carbachol, VIP and substance P did not induce secretion in vagotomized fish, indicating that <b>certain</b> <b>other</b> <b>fibres</b> in the vagus might be necessary for gas secretion. It is concluded that a VIP-like and a substance-P-like peptide might be involved in the control of the secretion of gas in the cod swimbladder, VIP by a neuronal mechanism and substance P by a neuronal and/or humoral mechanism...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a strong}} need of {{standardisation}} {{in the field of}} textile products and toys, in order to allow the enforceability of restrictions established in the EU legislation. The JRC has been actively involved in the progresses made on the development of standard methods for the characterisation of textile fibres and yarns and for the safety of textile products and toy, which are reviewed in this report. A number of standard methods published or under development are entirely or partly based on the JRC work. The work performed by Working Groups (WGs), of which the JRC is member, is described: CEN/TC 248 /WG 26 (on test methods for analysis of EC restricted substances in textiles); CEN/TC 248 /WG 30 (on quantitative analysis of fibre mixtures); CEN/TC/ 52 /WG 5 (on chemical properties of toys); and ISO/TC/WG 22 (on composition and chemical testing of textiles). The need for the test methods and their principles are explained, together with their stage in the approval process. The following standard methods have been published in 2013 : EN ISO 1833 - 22 	Textiles - Quantitative chemical analysis - Part 22 : Mixtures of viscose or certain types of cupro or modal or lyocell and flax fibres (method using formic acid and zinc chloride) EN ISO 1833 - 25 	Textiles - Quantitative chemical analysis - Part 25 : Mixtures of polyester and <b>certain</b> <b>other</b> <b>fibres</b> (method using trichloroacetic acid and chloroform) EN ISO 1833 - 26 	Textiles - Quantitative chemical analysis - Part 26 : Mixtures of melamine and cotton or aramide fibres (method using hot formic acid) EN 71 - 3 Safety of toys Part 3 : Migration of certain elements EN 71 - 12 Safety of toys Part 12 : N-nitrosamines and N-nitrosatable substances	 ISO 2076 Textiles - Man-made fibres - Generic names The following standard methods and technical reports are under development or in revision or in publication: PrEN ISO 16373 - 1, - 2 and - 3 Textile – Dyestuffs - Part 1 : General principles of testing coloured textiles for dyestuff; Part 2 : General method for the determination of extractable dyestuffs including allergenic and carcinogenic substances; Part 3 : Method for determination of carcinogenic extractable dyestuffs (method using triethylamine/methanol) PrEN 15777 : 2009 /prA 1 	Textiles - Test methods for phthalates Technical report - guidance on health and environmental issues related to the chemical content of textile products intended to clothing, interior textiles and upholstery prEN ISO 18254 - Textile – Detection and determination of APEO in textiles by HPLC-MS WI 00248537 and WI 00248536 Textile – Determination of metal content Part 1 : Determination of metals using microwave digestion; Part 2 : Determination of metals extracted by acidic artificial perspiration solution prEN 71 - 3 /pr A 1 Safety of toys Part 3 : Migration of certain elements WD 18074 Textiles - Identification of some animal fibres by DNA analysis method - Cashmere, wool, yak and their blends ISO/CD 17751 - 1 and - 2 Textiles - Quantitative analysis of cashmere, wool, other specialty animal fibers and their blends Part 1 : Light Microscopy method; Part 2 : Scanning Electron Microscopy method ISO FDIS 14389 	Textiles- Determination of the content of phthalates - tetrahydrofuran WD 17881 - 1, - 2 and - 3 	Textiles - Determination of certain flame retardants – Part 1 : Brominated flame retardants; Part 2 : Phosphorus flame retardants; Part 3 : Short chain paraffin flame retardantsJRC.

40|$|Insulin resistance, {{high blood}} glucose and raised total blood {{cholesterol}} are major {{risk factors for}} cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Partly they are caused by overweight and obesity. Diet is an important modifiable determinant for these risk factors and understanding how food characteristics, e. g. composition and structure, influence appetite and metabolic responses might aid {{in the development of}} healthy foods. In this thesis I examined how formulation, processing techniques (baking, cooking, extrusion) and process parameters affect rye, oat and wheat food characteristics (including structure and dietary fibre composition) and the implications of this for appetite and metabolic responses in humans. In vitro digestion methods were used to study structural changes, gastric disintegration, digesta viscosity and glucose release. In human trials, the effect of aeration method (fermentation or whipping) in rye crispbread production on appetite and metabolic responses was evaluated. When inulin was added to rye porridge, available water was reduced, decreasing starch gelatinisation and viscosity, changes with potentially counteracting effects on glucose response in humans. Smaller oat bran particles in bread increased degradation of β-glucan during fermentation, but also increased their solubility, events with opposing effects on digesta viscosity. Increased viscosity is an underlying mechanism for the ability of β-glucans, and <b>certain</b> <b>other</b> dietary <b>fibres,</b> to lower glucose response and total blood cholesterol. In fermented rye crispbread viscous fibres were more degraded and postprandial insulin response higher when compared with unfermented rye crispbread. However, the effect could also be attributed to slower gastric disintegration for the unfermented rye crispbread. Choice of aeration method had no observable impact on appetite. An amylose layer surrounding starch granules was observed only in sourdough-fermented soft rye bread. This seemed to inhibit glucose release, despite degraded viscous dietary fibres and rapid gastric disintegration. To conclude, processing and formulation were found to generally affect more than one food characteristic, which might be of relevance for a specific metabolic response. The net effect of characteristics associated with a targeted metabolic response should be considered when designing or selecting foods intended to promote health...|$|R
