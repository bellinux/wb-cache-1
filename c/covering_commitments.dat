Japan’s post-WWII baby boom and subsequent fertility drop resulted in a sharp demographic transition with large side effects. An aging workforce depressed {{economic growth in the}} 1990 s to 1 - 2 %, about actual performance; the 1987 - 91 “bubble ” and poor monetary and fiscal policy were of secondary importance. The shifting population structure also affected savings and investment balances and the sectoral flow-of-funds. The resulting strategic dilemmas led to repeated policy blunders and to the 1990 s banking crisis. Japan now has fiscal deficits of 7 % of GDP and government debt of 170 % of GDP. Restoring fiscal sustainability and <b>covering</b> <b>commitments</b> to retirees will require a net tax increase of 19 % of GDP.

A late challenge was mounted by spirited pole-sitter Rosberg (again <b>covering</b> Daly's F1 <b>commitments),</b> who approached the track's F1 lap record before his throttle jammed open and his ICI March was destroyed at the same corner which claimed team-mate South. Instead Henton took 2nd in another old March, Manfred Winkelhock (making a one-off appearance in a BMW-engined Ralt) took 3rd ahead of Stohr, Rothengatter and Dougall.|$|R

In 1985, the rules were changed to allow any boat within 20-foot length, 8-foot beam, instead of just hobie cats. In 1987, the rules were changed to allow unrestricted beam. There was no race from 1990-1996, but it returned in 1997 as a production class event. Since 2000, the Inter 20 catamaran manufactured by Performance Catamarans of Santa Ana, California is the only boat allowed.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{effectiveness}} of the U. S. nuclear weapons arsenal in <b>covering</b> security <b>commitments</b> with its foreign allies, particularly Japan. The U. S. has promised to defend allies all over the world with nuclear forces, and consequently has been forced into a delicate and precarious position. President Barack Obama wants to reach nuclear zero, which would make the world safe from nuclear destruction in the future; yet he also wants to provide security for allied nations in the present, using the very weapons he has marked for destruction. And he is facing an aging Cold War-era nuclear arsenal that needs serious repairs and upgrades in order to remain a credible and capable deterrent. This paper argues that while the U. S nuclear posture up to this point has been satisfactory enough to prevent panic and ensure protection of Japan, the evolving nuclear posture from this point onward will strengthen the credibility of existing security commitments, deter potential attackers, and give Japan the confidence to become a more coordinated partner in the relationship. Components of the paper include the evolution of U. S. nuclear strategy and deterrence, the three historical occurrences of tensions between the U. S. and Japan over nuclear issues, and the current concerns and actions in the alliance today...|$|R

25|$|At {{the request}} of the Security Council, the Secretary-General issued a report on women's {{participation}} in peacebuilding in 2010. The report outlines the challenges women continue to face in participating in recovery and peacebuilding process and the negative impact this exclustion has on them and societies more broadly. To respond to these challenges, it advocates a comprehensive 7-point action plan <b>covering</b> the seven <b>commitment</b> areas: mediation; post-conflict planning; financing; civilian capacity; post-conflict governance; rule of law; and economic recovery. The action plan aims to facilitate progress on the women, peace and security agenda. The monitoring and implementation of this action plan is now being led jointly by the Peacebuilding Support Office and UN Women. In April 2011, the two organizations convened a workshop to ensure that women are included in future post-disaster and post-conflict planning documents. In the same year, the PBF selected seven gender-sensitive peacebuilding projects to receive $5 million in funding.|$|R

In 2002, Uruguay and the United States created a Joint Commission on Trade and Investment (JCTI) to exchange ideas on a variety of economic topics. The Commission served as an important mechanism for the two countries to work to enhance and broaden their trade relationship, and facilitated the successful negotiation of the United States - Uruguay Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT), which entered into force on November 1, 2006.The United States and Uruguay signed the United States - Uruguay TIFA on January 25, 2007. The TIFA established the United States - Uruguay Trade and Investment Council (TIC) and serves as a mechanism to further deepen the trade and investment dialogue. On October 2, 2008, both governments signed protocols to the TIFA <b>covering</b> substantive <b>commitments</b> in the areas of trade facilitation and public participation in trade and environment.The TIFA contains an annex that established a work program calling for the two governments to address such matters as liberalization of bilateral trade and investment, intellectual property rights, regulatory issues, information and communications technology and electronic commerce, trade facilitation, trade and technical capacity building, trade in services, government procurement, and cooperation on sanitary and phytosanitary measures. The annex provides for the TIC to add other matters to the work program.In implementing the TIFA, both parties reconfirmed their commitment to expand economic opportunities between Uruguay and the United States while simultaneously coordinating their efforts to promote greater trade liberalization through the World Trade Organization (WTO).|$|R

It begins with a general description of GATS, indicates how health insurance is classified in GATS-defined service sectors, and outlines options countries have when making insurance-related market access commitments. It then explains why GATS commitments made to date have not yet had any measurable effect on changes in insurance markets. It reviews {{some of the issues}} addressed in current GATS negotiations and their potential implications for market access <b>commitments</b> <b>covering</b> health insurance. It concludes by reviewing the opportunities, risks and challenges presented by GATS for national policies and regulations affecting health insurance. A Brief Overview of GATS The General Agreement on Trade in Services of the World Trade Organization (WTO) came into effect in 1995, {{as a result of the}} Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. GATS establishes a framework of progressive liberalization in services trade, which allows countries substantial flexibility to determine: 1) which sectors of the service economy they wis...|$|R
40|$|Supplier inputs {{need to be}} {{delivered}} {{at the right time}} in the right quality and quantity to fully satisfy the operations requirements of buying firms. In achieving these performance goals, the importance of supplier commitment in managing the buyer-supplier relationship (BSR) should not be neglected in logistics operations. Due to organisational differences on operations priorities, it is a challenging task to manage a BSR which is inherently complex with many transactional and institutional aspects involved. This challenge is salient in logistics management with multiple upstream and downstream parties involved where the lack of concerted efforts can compromise performance of the entire logistics chain. For many enterprises, it remains unclear on how to nurture supplier commitment in support of their logistics operations. Considering this research void, we examine the antecedents of supplier <b>commitment</b> <b>covering</b> both transactional and institutional factors influencing supplier commitment in the BSR. Survey data collected from 358 suppliers of an international buying firm indicate that business uncertainty discourages supplier commitment, but the commitment can be reinforced with both explicit and implicit contracts used for governing the BSR.

40|$|Traditional gene-resource {{management}} programs for forest trees are long-term endeavors requiring sustained organizational <b>commitment</b> <b>covering</b> extensive landscapes. While successful in maintaining adaptation, genetic diversity and capturing traditional growth attributes gains, {{these programs are}} dependent on rigid methods requiring elaborate mating schemes, thus making them slow in coping with climate change challenges. Here, we review the significance of Norway spruce in the boreal region and its current management practices. Next, we discuss opportunities offered by novel technologies and, {{with the use of}} computer simulations, we propose and evaluate a dynamic landscape gene-resource management in Norway. Our suggested long-term management approach capitalizes on: (1) existing afforestation activities, natural crosses, and DNA-based pedigree assembly to create structured pedigree for evaluation, thus traditional laborious control crosses are avoided and (2) landscape level genetic evaluation, rather than localized traditional progeny trials, allowing for screening of adapted individuals across multiple environmental gradients under changing climate. These advantages lead to greater genetic response to selection in adaptive traits without the traditional breeding and testing scheme, facilitating conservation of genetic resources within the breeding population of the most important forest tree species in Norway. The use of in situ selection from proven material exposed to realistic conditions over vast territories has not been conducted in forestry before. Our proposed approach is in contrast to worldwide current programs, where genetic evaluation is constrained by the range of environments where testing is conducted, which may be insufficient to capture the broad environmental variation necessary to tackle adaptation under changing climate...|$|R
40|$|Headline issue: Effective {{international}} cooperation {{can help the}} world develop along a 2 °C pathway and adapt to the climatic changes already locked-in {{as a result of}} past and ongoing greenhouse gas emissions. It can also help countries seize the many opportunities and benefits associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy. The United Nations climate change conference in Paris at the end of 2015 is an important opportunity to advance toward those objectives. The French Government, which will host the Paris summit, has indicated that it will seek a ‘Paris Climate Alliance’ as an outcome, based on four aspects: A universal legal agreement, applicable to all countries National <b>commitments</b> <b>covering</b> control and reduction of emissions A financial and technology aspect aimed at scaling up finance and technology for climate change mitigation and adaptation while guaranteeing international solidarity with the most vulnerable countries An ‘Agenda of Solutions’ aimed at implementing accelerators to ensure more ambitious progress, above and beyond binding commitments. The legal agreement that is emerging is a hybrid agreement, involving a mix of centralised and decentralised, binding and non-binding elements. The agreement will be associated with ‘intended nationally determined contributions’ (INDCs) by countries to restrain and reduce emissions, the achievement of which will be non-binding internationally. The agreement is also likely to involve centralised, common processes to ensure the transparency of countries’ efforts and. It is widely hoped, that the agreement will also include a review-and-revision process for countries to increase the ambition of their commitments regularly over time (e. g. every five years). Yet, many obstacles remain on the road to Paris, and on the longer pathway toward an effective and equitable response to climate change. Key findings: International climate cooperation should be organised around: The long-term objective of achieving net zero emissions within the second half of this century Associated medium-term goals including the decarbonisation of electricity by mid-century and, well before mid-century, the phasing out of unabated coal-fired electricity generation It is appropriate to interpret the principle of equity (contained in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) of “common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities” (CBDR) in a dynamic, collaborative, and opportunity-focused way. The Paris agreement should contain dynamic elements that enable ambition to be raised over time, including a regular (e. g. five-yearly) review-and-revision process. Countries should be encouraged and assisted to develop domestic institutions, laws, policies, and political configurations that are conducive to: Increasing ambition Seizing opportunities for better growth Implementing commitments effectively Around US 6 trillion per year will need to be spent globally, and mostly in developing and emerging market countries, on infrastructure over the next 15 years. The climate finance being mobilised through the UNFCCC’s Paris process should be structured {{in a way that is}} complementary to the Sustainable Development Goals finance. International coordination on low-carbon innovation should include: Coordinated scale-up of national expenditure on research and development New public-private regional networks for the development and demonstration of new and locally-adapted technologies and processes Scaled-up public venture capital for innovative clean technology firms Better global coordination of clean energy deployment suppor...|$|R
