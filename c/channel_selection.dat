25|$|In 2002, Nintendo {{introduced}} the WaveBird Wireless Controller, the first wireless gamepad {{developed by a}} first-party console manufacturer. The RF-based wireless controller is similar in design to the standard controller. It communicates with the GameCube {{by way of a}} wireless receiver dongle connected to one of the console's controller ports. Powered by two AA batteries, which are housed in a compartment {{on the underside of the}} controller, the WaveBird lacks the vibration functionality of the standard controller. In addition to the standard inputs, the WaveBird features a <b>channel</b> <b>selection</b> dial – also found on the receiver – and an on/off switch. An orange LED on the face of the controller indicates when it is powered on. The controller is available in light grey and platinum color schemes.|$|E
25|$|Bayesian {{decision}} analysis {{can also be}} applied to the <b>channel</b> <b>selection</b> process. In order to help provide further information the method can be used that produces results in a profit or loss aspect. Prior information can include costs, expected profit, training expenses and any other costs relevant to the decision as well as managerial experience which can be displayed in a normal distribution. Bayesian decision making under uncertainty lets a marketing manager assess his/her options for channel logistics by computing the most profitable method choice. A number of different costs can be entered into the model that helps to assess the ramifications of change in distribution method. Identifying and quantifying all of the relevant information for this process can be very time consuming and costly if the analysis delays possible future earnings.|$|E

25|$|The Anniversary series found {{prominence}} with Joe Satriani in particular, who favoured {{the early}} EL34 powered versions and used only the clean channel live {{along with his}} signature Vox Satchurator distortion pedal {{which is based on}} his old modded Boss DS-1. Satriani used these older Boss pedals almost exclusively for live work and on a number of studio albums including The Extremist (1992) until the early 2000s. The Anniversary models were probably the most complicated Marshall ever (other than perhaps the later JVM), with MIDI <b>channel</b> <b>selection,</b> half power switching, pentode/triode switching, adjustable speaker excursion, and a low volume compensation switch. Despite all this complication the amps had a pure signal path that did not share preamp tubes between channels (unlike later Marshall designs like the TSL and JVM). Other famous 6100 users included Alex Lifeson on Rush's album Test for Echo (1996) and Ocean Colour Scene (OCS) guitarist Steve Cradock.|$|E

40|$|Efficient dynamic {{spectrum}} {{access mechanism}} {{is crucial for}} improving the spectrum utilization. In this paper, we consider the dynamic spectrum access mechanism design with both complete and incomplete network information. When the network information is available, we propose an evolutionary spectrum access mechanism. We use the replicator dynamics to study the dynamics of <b>channel</b> <b>selections,</b> and show that the mechanism achieves an equilibrium that is an evolutionarily stable strategy and is also max-min fair. With incomplete network information, we propose a distributed reinforcement learning mechanism for dynamic spectrum access. Each secondary user applies the maximum likelihood estimation method to estimate its expected payoff based on the local observations, and learns to adjust its mixed strategy for <b>channel</b> <b>selections</b> adaptively over time. We study the convergence of the learning mechanism based on the theory of stochastic approximation, and show that it globally converges to an approximate Nash equilibrium. Numerical {{results show that the}} proposed evolutionary spectrum access and distributed reinforcement learning mechanisms achieve up to 82 % and 70 % performance improvement than a random access mechanism, respectively, and are robust to random perturbations of <b>channel</b> <b>selections.</b> Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to title update!

50|$|With PRI circuits, the <b>channel</b> <b>selection</b> {{sequence}} is specified when the circuit is provisioned. Common practice {{is to have}} the PBX use descending <b>channel</b> <b>selection,</b> and the carrier to use ascending. Glare is not common on PRI circuits because the signalling is so fast, however it is not impossible (especially if there are subtle differences in the timers at either end, and the circuit is being used at near-capacity). The users will not experience a connection to an unexpected call (as would be the case with analog circuits), because glare causes protocol errors that generally prevent any sort of successful connection. Instead, {{one or both of the}} call attempts might fail, and ideally an error would appear in the logs (this depends on the logging capabilities of the systems at either end of the circuit). Glare is quite rare on PRI circuits, and can be difficult to troubleshoot.|$|E
50|$|Multiple-tag {{identification}} {{is performed using}} a combination of frequency-division multiple access and time-division multiple access (FTDMA). There are eight reply channels available for tags to use. In response to a valid command each tag randomly selects a channel on which to transmit its reply. The reply is transmitted once using the selected channel. Upon receiving the next valid command each tag randomly selects a new channel and transmits the reply using the newly selected channel. This method of reply frequency hopping using random <b>channel</b> <b>selection</b> is repeated for each subsequent valid command. The interrogator can selectively mute identified tags to remove them from the identification process. When a tag is muted, the tag will not transmit any replies. In addition to random <b>channel</b> <b>selection</b> the tags can randomly mute individual replies. When a reply is muted, the tag will not transmit that reply. Random muting is necessary when identifying very large populations of tags during singulation. All FTDMA frequency and time parameters are defined by the command.|$|E
5000|$|A {{familiar}} {{example of}} a device with sequential logic is a television set with [...] "channel up" [...] and [...] "channel down" [...] buttons. [...] Pressing the [...] "up" [...] button gives the television an input telling it to switch to the next channel above the one it is currently receiving. If the television is on channel 5, pressing [...] "up" [...] switches it to receive channel 6. However, if the television is on channel 8, pressing [...] "up" [...] switches it to channel [...] "9". In order for the <b>channel</b> <b>selection</b> to operate correctly, the television {{must be aware of}} which channel it is currently receiving, which was determined by past channel selections.
