40|$|Digitisation {{of cable}} {{television}} in India {{is an important}} and necessary step for regulating cable television sector in India and to bring transparency in the system to benefit all stakeholders, including consumers and <b>cable</b> <b>operators.</b> The <b>Cable</b> Television Networks (Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2011 mandated that all Cable companies should convert their analogue systems to digital in four metros by 31 March 2012 and whole country should go digital by 31 December 2014. The Act also requires the <b>cable</b> <b>operators</b> to submit reports on {{the total number of}} subscribers, subscription rates, and the number of subscribers for free-to-air and pay channels. In analogue systems, it was difficult to ascertain how many households are subscribing to cable services. The actual number was known only to the local <b>cable</b> <b>operators</b> who also worked as bill collection agents. TRAI mandated that revenues gathered by <b>cable</b> <b>operators</b> should be split among broadcasters, Multi Service <b>Operators</b> and Local <b>Cable</b> <b>Operators.</b> But <b>cable</b> <b>operators</b> undervalue the amount collected which was great loss for broadcasters. With the digitisation of cable television every household accessing signals is counted and <b>cable</b> <b>operators</b> are forced to share their collections with MSOs and broadcasters. Consumers are also able to select and pay only for the channels they wish to see. This research paper will study the impact of digitisation on broadcasters, MSOs, LCOs and viewers. Its advantages and disadvantages to various stakeholders, changes it will bring into television sector...|$|R

Prior to the spin-out, Time Warner had held an 84% stake in Time Warner Cable. Non-Time Warner shareholders received 0.083670 shares for each share already owned.

The company's UK branch, Comcast UK Cable Partners, went public while constructing a cable telecommunications network. With five other media companies, the corporation became an original investor in The Golf Channel. Following a bid in 1994 for $2.1 billion, Comcast increased its ownership of QVC from 15.5% of stock to a majority, {{in a move}} to prevent QVC from merging with CBS.

Neither Olbermann nor MSNBC divulged {{the reason for the}} cancellation. Many liberal bloggers and commentators blamed the <b>cable</b> <b>operator</b> Comcast for Olbermann's departure, accusing the company of silencing the host for political purposes just days after acquiring NBC Universal on January 18. Statements from MSNBC and Comcast denied this allegation. Media critic Howard Kurtz, former MSNBC anchor David Shuster, and an anonymous NBC executive said that Olbermann's 2010 suspension was a more likely precipitating factor in Countdowns cancellation.|$|E

In addition to the 1.4 million divested subscribers, Comcast also agreed to swap 1.6 million subscribers with Charter in an even, tax-efficient exchange whose intent {{is to improve the}} geographic spread of both companies.

5000|$|A {{major concern}} was that <b>cable</b> <b>operators</b> were not {{motivated}} to provide efficient security access mechanisms to equipment competitors.

[...] Polone viewed the move, as a whole, a reactionary one by Zucker, concluding that he was acting in self-preservation, since NBCUniversal owner General Electric (GE) was in the process of negotiating the sale of a controlling interest in the company to <b>cable</b> <b>operator</b> Comcast. When a story ran that night on The New York Times website that Fox had an [...] "overt interest" [...] in O'Brien and was not going along with the plan, Zucker reasoned that Polone was to blame. The situation became heated when Zucker placed a call to O'Brien's agent, Rick Rosen, inquiring on the story and demanding an immediate answer from the O'Brien camp regarding the changes. Gaspin spoke on the situation at a previously scheduled press conference that Sunday, noting that [...] "I obviously couldn’t satisfy either with 100 percent of what they wanted. That’s why I came up with this compromise."
