A model is developed of a time-varying long-term exchange rate path, mainly driven by the terms of trade and net foreign direct investment. This long-term path is then used to assess the developments in Romania’s actual exchange rate. The paper also examines Romania’s growth potential in the medium term.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the macroeconomic implications of, and policy responses to surges in private capital inflows across {{a large group}} of emerging and advanced economies. In particular, we identify 109 episodes of large net private capital inflows to 52 countries over 1987 - 2007. Episodes of large capital inflows are often associated with real exchange rate appreciations and deteriorating current account balances. More importantly, such episodes tend to be accompanied by an acceleration of GDP growth, but afterwards growth has often dropped significantly. A comprehensive assessment of various policy responses to the large inflow episodes leads to three major conclusions. First, keeping public expenditure growth steady during episodes can help limit real currency appreciation and foster better growth outcomes in their aftermath. Second, resisting nominal exchange rate appreciation through sterilized intervention is likely to be ineffective when the influx of capital is persistent. Third, tightening capital controls has not in general been associated with better outcomes.

40|$|A dynamic dependent-economy {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to investigate the}} role of the real exchange rate in determining the effects of foreign aid. If capital is perfectly mobile between sectors, untied aid has no longrun impact on the real exchange rate. A decline in the traded sector occurs because aid, being denominated in traded output, substitutes for exports in financing imports. While untied aid causes short-run real exchange appreciation, this response is very temporary and negligibly small. Tied aid, by influencing sectoral productivity, does generate permanent relative price effects. The analysis, which employs extensive numerical simulations, emphasizes the tradeoffs between real exchange adjustments, long-run capital accumulation, and economic welfare, associated with alternative forms of foreign aid.

40|$|The author {{examines}} {{the effect of}} fiscal adjustment on the real exchange rate. The argument is made that the direction and extent of that effect depends on the way fiscal adjustment is carried out. If a fiscal deficit is reduced mainly by reducing total government spending, {{the effect on the}} real exchange rate depends on whether the adjustment is achieved through proportionate cuts in both capital and current spending or through disproportionately greater cuts in capital spending. A disproportionately high cut in capital spending affects the composition of government spending between tradables and nontradables. Econometric estimates of the model for Bangladesh show that the propensity to spend on nontradables is greater for government spending than for private, and greater for the government's current spending than for its capital spending. The author emphasizes two important implications of fiscal adjustment for developing countries like Bangladesh : a) when fiscal adjustment involves unsustainably heavy cuts in <b>capital</b> spending, <b>appreciation</b> of the real exchange rate misaligns that rate, causing misallocation of resources and b) when disproportionate cuts in capital spending occur {{at the same time as}} trade liberalization, appreciation of the real exchange rate undermines the effectiveness of trade.

It argues that various influences—specifically, the real exchange rate history and trend and the factor intensity of production—can combine to motivate very large capital inflows. These inflows can either undermine attempts at monetary restraint or force excessive appreciations. They can also render the economy highly vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment. The policy implications of the analysis are awkward: exposure to global capital markets sets up difficult dilemmas for policy and leads to vulnerabilities that can be reduced but not eliminated.
