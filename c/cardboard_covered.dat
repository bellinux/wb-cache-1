The producers got her to agree to wear a thin skin-colored body stocking, but she caught a cold {{as a result of the}} shower mist, created by dropping dry ice into warm water and funneling the vapors into the shower by a hidden tube. Khambatta had to leave the location repeatedly to avoid hypercapnia. One scene required the Ilia probe to slice through a steel door in the sickbay; doors made out of paper, corrugated <b>cardboard</b> <b>covered</b> in aluminum foil, and cork were tested before the proper effect was reached. The illuminated button in the hollow of the probe's throat was a 12–volt light bulb that Khambatta could turn on and off via hidden wires; the bulb's heat eventually caused a slight burn.|$|E

40|$|Fractal {{geometry}} provides reliable {{models to}} describe geometrical properties of natural surfaces. Therefore, {{their use in}} the electromagnetic scattering methods deserves careful research. In order to have complete insight into the phenomenon, a measurement campaign on a fractal surface in a controlled environment is a key step. In this paper, we propose a technique for building a fractal surface {{that can be used}} for electromagnetic scattering evaluation purposes. The surface characteristics are imposed by computer synthesizing a bandlimited Weierstrass-Mandelbrot function, whose actual shape is constructed by means of a cheap innovative technique: the synthesized surface is made from <b>cardboard</b> <b>covered</b> with aluminum foil, which gives a conducting surface and creates the micro-scale conditions, useful to represent manufacturing errors. Statistics of the overall surface shape are then measured, analyzed and compared with the imposed ones, providing and verifying the rationale for a fully controlled surface to be applied in any kind of experiment on natural surfaces.
