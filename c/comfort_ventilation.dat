40|$|A {{sleeping}} {{person is}} naturally immobile {{in a relatively}} small space. Hence, task air conditioning (TAC) can be best applied to a sleeping environment because of its proven performances in energy saving. However, when using previously developed the TAC systems for sleeping environment applications, cold draft was a serious issue and could hardly be avoided due to a high air velocity and a low air temperature inside an occupied zone. Therefore, in the experimental study reported in this paper, a radiation-based TAC (R-TAC) system has been developed, and its performances experimentally evaluated.

The project consisted primarily of experiments performed in a full-scale controlled environment chamber (CEC) which a typical modular office environment was set up. The range of partition configurations and environmental parameters investigated included (1) partition height, (2) solid vs. airflow partitions, (3) airflow gap size, (4) supply air volume, (5) supply~room temperature difference, (6) supply diffuser location, (7) heat loud density, (8) workstation size, and (9) cooling vs. heating mode. Under steady-state conditions, multipoint measurements were made of air velocities, air temperatures, and radiant (globe) temperatures to characterize the key environmental variables affecting thermal comfort, and tracer gas methods using multipoint sampling locations were employed to determine the ventilation performance within the test chamber. The results indicated that variations in solid partition height produce only small differences in overall thermal and ventilation performance. Results also showed that while the existence of an airflow opening at the bottom of office partitions can, in some cases, produce slight increases in air velocities near the floor, there are no significant improvements in <b>comfort</b> conditions or <b>ventilation</b> efficiency within the workstations compared to results obtained for solid partitions.

40|$|The {{prevailing}} {{paradigm in}} indoor environment control of office buildings often excludes natural ventilation, {{due to the}} fact that its dynamic nature may not be compatible with the close control of mechanical conditioning systems. The challenges will be greater in terms of the potential high magnitudes of wind and buoyancy forces at high levels of tall buildings. This research is concerned with the prospect of tall office buildings that are purely naturally ventilated. It is proposed that “segmentation” might offer the least risky approach for natural ventilation design of non-domestic tall buildings. Accordingly, the generic design procedure are proposed for investigating the influence of segmentation on ventilation air flows: firstly, the single-cell envelope flow model is adopted to evaluate the steady-state bulk flows through openings under a specified design condition; secondly, dynamic thermal modelling with an air flow network module is used, because of the particular importance of the coupling between the airflow and thermal process for evaluating the year-round ventilated cooling potential of targeted spaces. The chosen thermal model utilizes a multi-cell airflow network model (AFN) since the targeted buildings can no longer be described by a single-cell model; thirdly, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation is suggested in the later design stage to cope with insufficient resolution of local airflow distribution in previous modelling stages; finally, the overall performance of <b>comfort</b> <b>ventilation</b> is then interpreted in relation to adaptive thermal comfort theory by the use of Building Bioclimatic Charts, which offers a way of rapidly testing whether or not natural ventilation is likely to produce comfortable conditions. The novelty of this work lies not in the methodology, which uses available modelling tools, but in the evaluation of naturally ventilated tall buildings with reference to segmentation in the climatic context of Taiwan. The effect of segmentation is evaluated by comparing the overall ventilation performance under three different building configurations, namely the isolated, segmented and non-segmented tall buildings. The overall objectives are to determine whether the magnitudes of air flow rates and the resultant flow velocity can achieve the desired <b>comfort</b> <b>ventilation</b> over a range of specified conditions. Potential scenarios where the design goals may not be ensured are identified. The feasibility for naturally ventilated tall office buildings in hot and humid climates is clarified accordingly...|$|E

Although it may improve nocturnal ventilation, we hypothesized that increased pressure swings related to volume targeting may have a deleterious effect on sleep structure and patient comfort. MethodsPatients in stable clinical condition (n= 12) treated by BPPV for obesity-hypoventilation (BMI: 44 ± 8 kg/m 2) for a median of 30 months (range: 2 – 138), underwent nocturnal polysomnography with transcutaneous capnography on 2 consecutive nights with either BPPV and usual ventilator settings or BPPV with volume targeting, in randomized sequence. Subjective quality of sleep (St. Mary's Hospital Questionnaire) and <b>comfort</b> of <b>ventilation</b> (VAS scales) were also assessed. ResultsMean IPAP, mean tidal volume, and total ventilation increased significantly with volume targeting. Control of nocturnal hypoventilation was slightly improved with volume targeting (nocturnal TcPCO 2 : 42 ± 9 vs. 45 ± 5 mmHg, p= 0. 04). However, total sleep time and stage 2 sleep were greater without volume targeting, and wake after sleep onset and awakenings > 20 s increased with volume targeting. Subjectively, patients described a lighter sleep, of lesser quality and more frequent awakenings with volume targeting; ventilation was perceived as less comfortable, with an increased perception of leaks and of “too much air”.

In addition to providing fresh air, which enhances occupant productivity and comfort, strategic implementation of natural ventilation in buildings reduces the energy needed for cooling. And this reduction in energy consumption significantly reduces carbon dioxide emissions. During the initial design phase, designers routinely use climate-file based analysis to evaluate the potential for <b>comfort</b> <b>ventilation</b> against other passive building strategies. Following this initial screening, it is customary to conduct detailed simulations to further develop design ideas. At this point, inconsistencies can arise between the early climate-file based analysis and later-stage simulations.

40|$|International audienceNatural {{ventilation}} {{of buildings}} {{is a common}} way to improve indoor air quality, thermal comfort in summer and reduce energy consumption due to air conditioning. However, efficiency of such a system is highly dependent on climatic conditions. This paper investigates the use of thermal breezes, characterized by moderate speeds and well-defined direction, to improve natural cross ventilation technique on Mediterranean coastal zones. The interest of this phenomenon is highlighted {{by the development of}} climate indicators with meteorological data from various places in Corsica (France). A statistical wind rose is used to give more information on main wind sectors and speed fluctuations. The natural ventilation potential is assessed by a radar plot which groups the main climate indicators for <b>comfort</b> <b>ventilation</b> and passive cooling. Tracer gas measurements on a seaside building in Corsica show that high air change rates are reached by cross ventilation during day (higher than 25 ACH). Night ventilation gives more moderate results for passive cooling with air change rates close to 10 ACH. As the comfort in building is related to the airflow, it is necessary to be able to control it.

Due to the regularity of thermal breezes, it shows that even if the airflow varies greatly during the day, a minimal control on opening surface is sufficient to maintain the airflow rate on a comfortable range...|$|E
