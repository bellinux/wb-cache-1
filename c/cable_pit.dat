The frame was bolted into concrete, and standard Roxtec products were modified to seal power and earth cables entering the <b>cable</b> <b>pit</b> and motor control centre (MCC).

50|$|There {{are three}} launch pads for the Luftwaffe Bachem Ba 349 Natter rocket interceptors {{located in the}} Hasenholz forest near Kirchheim unter Teck. They are all that remain from the once active launch site {{constructed}} in 1945. The three launchpads are arranged {{in the form of}} an equilateral triangle, whose sides point toward the east and the south. The distance between the launchpads is approximately 50 meters. The circular concrete pads on which the Bachem Ba 349s and their launch towers once stood still exist. In the center of each of the three concrete plates is a square hole approximately 50 centimeters deep, which once served as the foundation for the launch tower. Beside each hole is a pipe, cut off at ground level, which was probably once a <b>cable</b> <b>pit.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Douglas Corporation, {{the local}} {{authority}} {{responsible for the}} area, persuaded the Isle of Man Tramways & Electric Power Company to build a line serving the hilly area of Upper Douglas in return for an extended franchise to operate the horse tramway. The line was built to [...] narrow gauge. Douglas Corporation acquired the tramway in 1902 {{after the collapse of}} Dumbbell's Bank and the section south of the depot in York Road was closed as it was felt that the gradient made it too dangerous to operate. The service was downgraded to seasonal in 1922. After the line closed, the tracks remained in place until they were lifted in 1932. (in contradiction to this source however road works in the past - 1980's - revealed some of the rails buried well under the modern road surface, in addition in Waverley Road on the Depot Entrance a set of tramway rails and points remain, however this may actually be from the time that the depot was used to service the horsetrams - they were towed up to the depot using double decker buses). In January 2000, work in connection with the IRIS scheme unearthed the terminal <b>cable</b> <b>pit</b> at Broadway.|$|E

25|$|It is {{determined}} that the leak into the <b>cable</b> storage <b>pit</b> from unit 2 was likely due to a faulty joint where the pit meets a duct. The pit leads to a gravel layer beneath, resulting in highly radioactive water pouring directly into the sea.|$|R
5000|$|An {{operational}} launch {{site for}} the first Ba 349A-1 operational Natters under the code name Operation Krokus was being established in a small wooded area called Hasenholz, south of the Stuttgart to Munich autobahn and {{to the east of}} Nabern unter Teck. Around the end of February and the beginning of March the Todt Organisation was in action, constructing each set of the trios of concrete foundations (or [...] "footings") for the launch towers. These three launch pads and their towers were arranged at the corners of an equilateral triangle, 120 m per side. The specific locations are said to be , [...] and [...] In the centre of each of the three concrete footings is a square hole approximately 50 centimeters deep, which once served as the foundation for the launch tower. Beside each hole is a pipe, cut off at ground level, which was probably once a <b>cable</b> <b>pit.</b> These three concrete pads were noticed by a surveyor in the autumn of 1945, but not rediscovered until 1999. In March 1945 eight pilots, who were experienced, mostly highly decorated and volunteers for the first operational flights, started training at the Lager Heuberg. This training continued until the first half of April at which time they moved to the Hasenholz operational area. The first three manned and fully armed A1 Krokus examples were scheduled to be launched from 20 April, which was Hitler's birthday. But on that day the US 10th Armored Division drove its tanks into Kirchheim unter Teck to the northwest of Hasenholz wood. The next day it crossed the autobahn and headed straight for the Natter operational area. The Natter group subsequently retreated to Waldsee.|$|E

The experiment {{indicated that the}} wavelength shift of Two-Pipe fiber Bragg grating temperature sensor, only sensitive to temperature and linear with temperature variance, was 0. 019 nm and the cable temperature changed 2. 3 °C at 0. 25 m away from the heat source. The sensor was applied in one transformer substation cable trenches and cable wells. 24 -hour real-time monitoring datum were stable. Monitoring datum were normal in 130 days...|$|E
40|$|The 69 KV Substation Project {{is based}} on the {{recognized}} need to provide a continuous, reliable source of power and to improve the firm capacity of the electrical service to all production facilities at Mound. The project consists of the following major element: 69 KV Substation: (1) Install a 69 KV Substation and associated equipment with two parallel 18 MVA transformers. (2) Install duct bank as required and provide 15 KV feeder cable from new substation to existing Substation 95 for connection to Mound`s existing primary distribution system. (3) Install duct bank for underground routing of the 15 KV feeder cable from Manhole 5 C to the existing power house <b>cable</b> <b>pit.</b> (4) Reconfigure existing Dayton Power and Light Co. 15 KV switchgear in P Building. The purpose of this Quality Assurance Plan (QA Plan) is to assure that the objectives of the United States Department of Energy (D. O. E.) and EG&G Mound Applied Technologies, Miamisburg, Ohio (Mound) are met for this non-weapons project relative to health and safety, protection of the environment, reliability and continuity of operations, and documentation of quality efforts. This QA Plan identifies the activities and responsibilities which are necessary in the design, procurement, fabrication, installation, and start up of this project in order to meet these objectives...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the fabrication {{of a complete}} thermocouple assembly. Elements of construction and installation are discussed under the headings thermocouple current, fabrication, switch box fabrication, field installation of the cable and temperature readings. The principle of measurement is that the emf generated between a reference junction of known temperature and one of unknown temperature can give the unknown temperature. The two metals used are copper and constantan, and the wires must be protected electrically from short circuits. Twenty gauge duplex wire individually encased in polyvinyl chloride is satisfactory. The wires from the installation are usually terminated in a weatherproof switch box. Leeds and Northrup rotary switches, type 31 - 3 are used. Simple clamp type connectors and terminal blocks ensure positive connection. The copper wires are attached to rotary switches. The constantan wires are attached to a common constantan wire. The thermocouple cable's outer jacket is cut at the depths at which readings are required and the copper and constantan wires are soldered to give a thermocouple junction. The completed multi-wire cable is inserted in a suitable length of polyethylene hose. A lucite or brass plug seals the lower end. Steel switch boxes house the switches and wire connection from the elements and still provide accessibility for readings. The cable and switch box are filled with high quality transformer oil. Installation involves pushing the assembly into a bore hole {{or in the case}} of short <b>cables,</b> a test <b>pit.</b> Longer assemblies are usually lowered into bore holes with a 10 - 20 lb weight tied to the bottom. Finally the bore hole is backfilled so that no air pockets exist. Ce document traite de la fabrication d'un thermocouple.
