5000|$|The poor {{condition}} of handloom weavers was notorious in the 1830s, and was rapidly deteriorating. A parliamentary select <b>committee</b> produced reports <b>on</b> <b>petitions</b> from the weavers in 1834 and 1835. It was chaired by Sir John Maxwell, 7th Baronet, who with John Fielden called witnesses {{sympathetic to the}} weavers. Fielden via Maxwell introduced a minimum wage bill in parliament in 1835. The opposition of laisser faire members meant it had no chance; but Fielden continued to advocate action. The Royal Commission was agreed in 1837. By 1840 the number of weavers had dropped by 100,000. They had also, in numbers, become Chartists of the [...] "physical force" [...] tendency.|$|R
50|$|A {{settlement}} {{which eventually}} became Kirovsk {{was founded in}} 1929, soon after an expedition led by Alexander Fersman had discovered large deposits of apatite and nepheline in the Khibiny Massif in the 1920s. By the end of 1930, its population grew to ten thousand people, and a mining and chemical plant here was well under construction. Due to the rapid growth, the Presidium of the Murmansk Okrug Executive <b>Committee</b> <b>petitioned</b> <b>on</b> January 18, 1931 to grant the settlement town status and to name it Khibinogorsk.

5000|$|At {{the death}} of the 26th Earl of Mar and {{eleventh}} Earl of Kellie in 1866, the Earldom of Kellie and the family's estates passed to Walter Erskine, the cousin of the late Earl, and his heir male.

Goodeve changed his name to Goodeve Erskine; his claim was agreed upon by all. He even participated in the election of representative peers for the Peerage of Scotland.

500|$|Allen {{traveled}} {{into the}} northern {{parts of the}} Grants early in 1775, as was his custom, for solitude and to hunt for game and land opportunities. A few days after his return, news came that blood had finally been shed over the land disputes. Most of the resistance activity had until then taken place {{on the west side}} of the Green Mountains; on March 13, a small riot in the shire town of Westminster, on the east side of the mountains, resulted in the death of two men. Allen and a troop of Boys traveled to Westminster where, under Allen's influence, the town's convention adopted a strongly worded resolution authorizing the drafting of a plea to the King to remove them [...] "out of so oppressive a jurisdiction". The preparation of the petition was assigned to a committee which included Allen.

5000|$|The committee's papers consist almost {{exclusively}} of <b>committee</b> reports <b>on</b> the <b>petitions</b> and memorials {{referred to them}} and covered {{a wide variety of}} topics. Most of the reports begin with a restatement of the prayer of the petitioner, continue with a presentation of facts gathered by the committee, and conclude with a recommendation and suggested resolution. In general, reports concerning increased duties on books, paint and copper, salt and hats, and other products offer little explanation of the committee's recommendations. Reports responding to petitions requesting drawbacks or refunds of duties paid, however, more often explain the reasoning behind the committee's decisions. Those merchants, manufacturers, and others praying for drawbacks on damaged goods or goods shipped past the deadline for receiving drawbacks were regularly denied their requests. The specific reason given for some of the denials is that [...] "negligence, forgetfulness, and misconception of the law" [...] were not suitable excuses. Petitions pleading outbreaks of disease and mistakes of customs officials, on the other hand, sometimes received favorable treatment.|$|R
