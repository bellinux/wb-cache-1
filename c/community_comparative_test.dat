40|$|Ground based {{measurements}} of slant {{total electron content}} (TEC) can be assimilated into ionospheric models to produce 3 -D representations of ionospheric electron density. The Electron Density Assimilative Model (EDAM) has been developed for this purpose. Previous tests using EDAM and ground based data have demonstrated that {{the information on the}} vertical structure of the ionosphere is limited in this type of data. The launch of the COSMIC satellite constellation provides the opportunity to use radio occultation data which has more vertical information. EDAM assimilations have been run for three time periods representing quiet, moderate and disturbed geomagnetic conditions. For each run, three data sets have been ingested &ndash; only ground based data, only COSMIC data and both ground based and COSMIC data. The results from this preliminary study show that both ground and space based data are capable of improving the representation of the vertical structure of the ionosphere. However, the analysis is limited by the incomplete deployment of the COSMIC constellation and the use of auto-scaled ionosonde data. The first of these can be addressed by repeating this type of study once full deployment has been achieved. The latter requires the manual scaling of ionosonde data; ideally an agreed data set would be scaled and made available to the <b>community</b> to facilitate <b>comparative</b> <b>testing</b> of assimilative models...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, most field {{efficiency}} {{measurements are}} made to verify guarantees for a new project, which have led to that this issue is well covered by standardization guidelines.

A <b>comparative</b> <b>test</b> is here defined as a test where efficiency is evaluated at the same flow conditions but with modified or changed turbine or water conduits.
