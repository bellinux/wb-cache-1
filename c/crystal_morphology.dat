2500|$|Interestingly, {{all three}} derivations (Hessel's, Bravais', and Gadolin's), which {{established}} a small finite {{number of possible}} crystal symmetries from first principles, were based on external <b>crystal</b> <b>morphology</b> rather than a crystal's internal structural arrangement (i.e. lattice symmetry). [...] However, the 32 classes of crystal symmetry are one-and-the-same as the 32 crystallographic point groups. [...] After seminal work on space lattices by , Arthur Moritz Schönflies (1853–1928), Evgraf Stepanovich Fedorov (1853–1919), and William Barlow (1845–1934), the connection between space lattices and the external morphology of crystals was espoused by Paul Niggli (1888 - 1953), particularly in his 1928 Kristallographische und Strukturtheoretische Grundbegriffe. For example, the repetition, or translation (physics), of a lattice plane produces a stack of parallel planes, the last member {{of which may be}} manifested morphologically as one of the external faces of the crystal.|$|E
2500|$|Briefly, {{a crystal}} {{is similar to}} {{three-dimensional}} wallpaper, {{in that it is}} an endless repetition of some motif (a group of atoms or molecules). The motif is created by point group operations, while the wallpaper, which is called the space lattice, is generated by translation of the motif with or without rotation or reflection. [...] The symmetry of the motif is the true point group symmetry of the crystal and it causes the symmetry of the external forms. Specifically, the crystal's external morphological symmetry must conform to the angular components of the space group symmetry operations, without the translational components. [...] Under favorable circumstances, point groups (but not space groups) can be determined solely by examination of the <b>crystal</b> <b>morphology,</b> without the need for analysis of an X-ray diffraction pattern. This is not always possible because, of the many forms normally apparent or expected in a typical crystal specimen, some forms may be absent or show unequal development. The word habit is used to describe the overall external shape of a crystal specimen, which depends on the relative sizes of the faces of the various forms present. In general, a substance may crystallize in different habits because the growth rates of the various faces need not be the same.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{investigation}} of chemical influences on the growth of ice crystals from water vapor. In one set of experiments, we grew ice crystals in a vapor diffusion chamber, observing <b>crystal</b> <b>morphologies</b> at temperatures from 0 C to - 25 C in different background gases and {{with a variety of}} gaseous chemical additives. In a second set of experiments, we measured ice crystal growth rates at - 5 C and - 15 C in a free-fall flow chamber, using normal laboratory air and ultra-clean nitrogen gas, both with and without chemical additives. Conclusions from these experiments include: 1) In nitrogen gas at a pressure of one atmosphere, no tested chemical additives at concentrations below 10 ppm produced any observable changes in ice crystal growth morphologies; 2) Growth in ultra-clean nitrogen gas was not significantly different from growth in ordinary laboratory air; 3) Chemical additives affected plate-like dendritic growth at - 15 C more readily than growth at higher temperatures; 4) Chemical additives tended to promote the growth of columnar crystals over plate-like crystals; 5) Ice growth in air, nitrogen, helium, argon, hydrogen, and methane gases at a pressure of one atmosphere yielded essentially the same temperature-dependent <b>crystal</b> <b>morphologies...</b>|$|R
40|$|Crystal growth {{mechanisms}} {{are crucial to}} understanding the complexity of <b>crystal</b> <b>morphologies</b> in nature and advanced technological materials, such as the faceting and dendrites found in snowflakes and the microstructure and associated strength properties of structural and icy planetary materials. In this article, we present observations of pressure-induced ice VI crystal growth, which have been predicted theoretically, but had never been observed experimentally to our knowledge. Under modulated pressure conditions in a dynamic-diamond anvil cell, rough single ice VI crystal initially grows into well defined octahedral crystal facets. However, as the compression rate increases, the crystal surface dramatically changes from rough to facet, and from convex to concave because of a surface instability, and thereby the growth rate suddenly increases by an order of magnitude. Depending on the compression rate, this discontinuous jump in crystal growth rate or “shock crystal growth” eventually produces 2 D carpet-type fractal morphology, and moreover dendrites form under sinusoidal compression, whose <b>crystal</b> <b>morphologies</b> are remarkably similar to those predicted in theoretical simulations under a temperature gradient field. The observed strong dependence of the growth mechanism on compression rate, therefore, suggests {{a different approach to}} developing a comprehensive understanding of crystal growth dynamics...|$|R

50|$|Many plants {{accumulate}} {{calcium oxalate}} crystals {{in response to}} surplus calcium, which is found throughout the natural environment. The crystals are produced in an intriguing variety of shapes. The <b>crystal</b> <b>morphology</b> depends on the taxonomic group of the plant. In one study of over 100 species, {{it was found that}} calcium oxalate accounted for 6.3% of plant dry weight. <b>Crystal</b> <b>morphology</b> and the distribution of raphides (in roots or leaves or tubers etc.) is similar in same taxa but different in others leaving possible opportunities for plant key characteristics and systematic identification; mucilage in raphide containing cells makes light microscopy difficult, though. Little is known about the mechanisms of sequestration or indeed the reason for accumulation of raphides but it is most likely as a defense mechanism against herbivory. It has also been suggested that in some cases raphides may help form plant skeletal structure. Raphides typically occur in parenchyma cells in aerial organs especially the leaves, and are generally confined to the mesophyl. As the leaf area increases, so does the number of raphides, the process starting in even young leaves. The first indications that the cell will contain crystals is shown when the cells enlarge with a larger nucleus.|$|E
