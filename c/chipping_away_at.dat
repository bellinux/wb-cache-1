25|$|In England's first Super Eight {{match against}} Ireland, Nixon contributed a useful 19 off 15 deliveries, hitting a 4 and a 6 along the way, {{accelerating}} the team's total to 266. Much like Canada in the Group Stage, Ireland were steadily <b>chipping</b> <b>away</b> <b>at</b> England's total, when Nixon again disrupted momentum with a stumping – this time nabbing Niall O'Brien off Michael Vaughan's bowling, for 63. Ultimately, England won by 48 runs.|$|E
25|$|Billy Taylor, however, {{played a}} special knock. Lasting 116 balls, he scored only 9 runs, but his stamina proved invaluable. He forged good {{partnerships}} with Katich and Crawley, giving Hampshire a good platform to hit loose from. Wicketkeeper Nic Pothas was top-scorer with 65, but Zimbabwe all-rounder Sean Ervine (30) and Dimitri Mascarenhas (44) also chipped in to lift Hampshire to 304. A spirited reply from Middlesex was always tampered by the Hampshire bowlers <b>chipping</b> <b>away</b> <b>at</b> their line-up patiently, and despite 52 from former Kent batsman Ed Smith, Middlesex were defeated as Chris Tremlett ripped out the tail, ending with four for 59 – just outperformed by Warne, who took four for 58.|$|E
25|$|McCain {{argues that}} American {{military}} and intelligence personnel in future wars will suffer for abuses committed in 2006 by the US {{in the name}} of fighting terrorism. He fears the administration's policy will put American prisoners at risk of torture, summary executions and other atrocities by <b>chipping</b> <b>away</b> <b>at</b> Geneva Conventions. He argues that his rival bill to Bush’s plan gives defendants access to classified evidence being used to convict them and will set tight limits on use of testimony obtained by coercion. Furthermore it offers CIA interrogators some legal protections from charges of abuse, but rejects the administration’s plan to more narrowly define the Geneva Conventions’ standards for humane treatment of prisoners. McCain insists this issue overrides politics.|$|E

25|$|The iPod Shuffle was {{announced}} {{at the same time}} as the Mac Mini. Like the iPod Shuffle, the Mac Mini is a scaled-down product which has been introduced at a lower price. These two products together can be seen as a conscious effort on the part of Apple management to target a lower-end market and increase visibility in the mass-market. Previously, the success of Apple's iPod and especially the iPod Mini had been <b>chipping</b> <b>away</b> <b>at</b> the inexpensive flash player market, causing flash players at the beginning of 2005 to account for less than half the market share they did in 2004. However, the original and Mini iPods were expensive and the Shuffle was intended to make the iPod compete with mainstream players.|$|E

Further, he suggested that if the dam were to be named after any one person, it should be for California Senator Hiram Johnson, a lead sponsor of the authorizing legislation. Roosevelt also referred to the dam as Boulder Dam, and the Republican-leaning Los Angeles Times, which at the time of Ickes' name change had run an editorial cartoon showing Ickes ineffectively <b>chipping</b> <b>away</b> <b>at</b> an enormous sign [...] "HOOVER DAM," [...] reran it showing Roosevelt reinforcing Ickes, but having no greater success.|$|E
2500|$|The period 1945 to 1974, {{the baby}} scoop era, saw rapid growth and {{acceptance}} of adoption {{as a means to}} build a family.

Even in his earliest works, where {{he uses the}} standard French model, Rameau—the born symphonist and master of orchestration—composes novel and unique pieces. A few pieces are particularly striking, such as the overture to Zaïs, depicting the chaos before {{the creation of the}} universe, that of Pigmalion, suggesting the sculptor's <b>chipping</b> <b>away</b> <b>at</b> the statue with his mallet, or many more conventional depictions of storms and earthquakes, as well perhaps as the imposing final chaconnes of Les Indes galantes or Dardanus.|$|E

2500|$|Starting in the 1960s, the U.S. Supreme Court began <b>chipping</b> <b>away</b> <b>at</b> the in loco parentis doctrine, giving college {{students}} more civil liberties {{such as the}} right of due process in disciplinary proceedings (Dixon v.

2500|$|In May 2012, Shaffir joined 10,000 protestors {{demanding}} that the proposed 2013 Israeli State Budget be made more favorable to middle and lower income Israelis.

Almost immediately after the 2013 State budget was passed, the Finance Committee pushed through changes that largely benefited West Bank settlements and right wing ideological projects, while <b>chipping</b> <b>away</b> <b>at</b> social benefits. Shaffir learned that while the Finance Committee process is in theory meant to fill in the bits and pieces the national budget failed to account for, it quietly shifts line items by as much as 87%, dramatically altering the original budget. [...] Shaffir appointed a team of volunteers to investigate the budgetary transfers and eventually brought her concerns to the Supreme Court which ruled that the Finance Ministry must reach a compromise with Shaffir on a new method for budget transfers by February 2015.|$|E
2500|$|On September 17, 2006, Warner {{said that}} U.S. {{military}} and intelligence personnel in future wars will suffer for abuses committed in 2006 by the US {{in the name}} of fighting terrorism. He feared that the administration’s civilian lawyers and a president who never saw combat were putting U.S. service personnel at risk of torture, summary executions and other atrocities by <b>chipping</b> <b>away</b> <b>at</b> Geneva Conventions’ standards that have protected them since 1949. Following the Supreme Court ruling on Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, which was adverse to the Bush Administration, Warner (with Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain) negotiated with the White House the language of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, suspending habeas corpus provisions for anyone deemed by the Executive Branch an [...] "unlawful combatant" [...] and barring them from challenging their detentions in court. Warner's vote gave a retroactive, nine-year immunity to U.S. officials who authorized, ordered, or committed acts of torture and abuse, permitting the use of statements obtained through torture to be used in military tribunals so long as the abuse took place by December 30, 2005.|$|E

2500|$|Douglas found Stern's next job, hosting mornings at album-oriented rock station WWDC in Washington, D.C. Stern was {{cautious}} about the offer at first {{as the general}} manager [...] "was not really aware of what I did", but accepted the offer and started on March 2, 1981. During his time relocating from Detroit, Stern spent several weeks planning out a new show, determined to become more successful as the station presented a good chance for him to work in New York City, his career goal. He was determined to [...] "kill my competition. I {{was going to say}} whatever the fuck I was going to say ... The first step was to put my team together". He sought a co-host {{with a sense of humor}} to riff with on news and current events. The station then paired Stern with Robin Quivers, a former nurse in the air force and news reporter at WFBR in Baltimore. Quivers was sent a tape of Stern interviewing a prostitute on the air, and accepted the job without meeting him. She assumed she [...] "would come in and do the news ... but it wasn't that way". Despite several issues management had over content, which led to the installation of a seven-second delay to censor questionable moments, Stern [...] "kept <b>chipping</b> <b>away</b> <b>at</b> management's archaic approach and we began to assemble the program I had envisioned", which included the addition of Norris as his writer and producer. In one incident, Stern revealed his wife's miscarriage on the air. In January 1982, Stern had the second highest rated morning show in the city.|$|E
