Syrup producers also began using tractors to haul vats of sap from the trees being tapped (the sugarbush) to the evaporator. Some producers adopted motor-powered tappers and metal tubing systems to convey sap from the tree to a central <b>collection</b> <b>container,</b> but these techniques were not widely used. Heating methods also diversified: modern producers use wood, oil, natural gas, propane, or steam to evaporate sap. Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of the syrup.|$|E
25|$|For a {{recycling}} program to work, having a large, stable supply of recyclable material is crucial. Three legislative options {{have been used}} to create such a supply: mandatory recycling <b>collection,</b> <b>container</b> deposit legislation, and refuse bans. Mandatory collection laws set recycling targets for cities to aim for, usually in the form that a certain percentage of a material must be diverted from the city's waste stream by a target date. The city is then responsible for working to meet this target.|$|E
2500|$|In {{places such}} as Kerala where {{coconuts}} are in abundance, the half shell of coconut {{was used as the}} latex <b>collection</b> <b>container.</b> Glazed pottery or aluminium or plastic cups became [...] more common in Kerala and other countries. The cups are supported by a wire that encircles the tree. This wire incorporates a spring so it can stretch as the tree grows. The latex is led into the cup by a galvanised [...] "spout" [...] knocked into the bark. Tapping normally takes place early in the morning, when the internal pressure of the tree is highest. A good tapper can tap a tree every 20 seconds on a standard half-spiral system, and a common daily [...] "task" [...] size is between 450 and 650 trees. Trees are usually tapped on alternate or third days, although many variations in timing, length and number of cuts are used. [...] "Tappers would make a slash in the bark with a small hatchet. These slanting cuts allowed latex to flow from ducts located on the exterior or the inner layer of bark (cambium) of the tree. Since the cambium controls the growth of the tree, growth stops if it is cut. Thus, rubber tapping demanded accuracy, so that the incisions would not be too many given the size of the tree, or too deep, which could stunt its growth or kill it." ...|$|E

40|$|Management {{of urban}} solid waste implies the collection, transfer, {{treatment}} recycle, reuse {{and disposal of}} such waste. Collection of urban household solid waste traditionally rests with government agencies designated with such responsibility. Solid waste collection begins from storage at the household level to the final treatment or disposal point and represents {{the most important aspect}} of urban solid waste management. Little has however been written on urban household solid waste collection in Nigeria. Using empirical data from three urban areas of Anambra State, Nigeria, the paper examines the place of informal private solid waste collectors in household solid waste collection. The ANOVA technique is used to test the null hypothesis that the sample means of the distance to designated community/street solid waste <b>collection</b> <b>containers</b> in the residential neighbourhoods of the three towns are equal.

40|$|Drinking {{water can}} become {{contaminated}} following its collection from communal {{sources such as}} wells and tap stands, as well as during its storage in the home. However, the mechanisms leading to contamination between the points of supply and consumption have not been well documented. This study carried out field-based experiments in three rural Honduran communities to investigate the potential for contamination through hand contact, method used to draw water, and dirty <b>collection</b> <b>containers.</b> The possibility of bacterial growth occurring in stored water was also considered. Hand–water contact was observed frequently during the collection and drawing of drinking water. Faecal contamination was present on 44 % of women's fingertips tested during normal household activities, and this faecal material was easily transferred to water. An immediate deterioration in water quality was observed on filling <b>collection</b> <b>containers.</b> Faecal material was detected on cups and beakers used for drawing stored drinking water. Evidence was produced indicating that thermotolerant coliforms remain attached to the inner surface of clay storage containers after rinsing. Drinking-water quality deteriorates during collection and storage {{as a result of}} multiple factors linked to hygiene practices and circumstances. However, hands have the greatest potential to introduce contamination because of the constant risk of contact during household water management...|$|R

50|$|AOP {{is usually}} treated by blood {{transfusion}} but the indications for this are still unclear. Blood transfusions have {{the risk of}} incompatibility and transfusion reactions as well as viral infections. Also, blood transfusions are costly and add to parental anxiety. The best treatment in prevention is minimizing the amount of blood drawn from the infant. It is found that since blood loss attributable to laboratory testing is {{the primary cause of}} anemia among preterm infants during the first weeks of life, we quantified blood lost attributable to phlebotomy overdraw, something that might be avoided. A study was done to see when and if overdraw was a problem. They recorded all of the data that could be of influence such as the test performed, the blood <b>collection</b> <b>container</b> used, the infants location (neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and intermediate intensive care unit), the infant’s weight sampling and the phlebotomist’s level of experience, work shift, and clinical role. Infants were classified by weight into 3 groups: <1 kg, 1 to 2 kg, and >2 kg. The volume of blood removed was calculated by subtracting the weight of the empty <b>collection</b> <b>container</b> from that of the container filled with blood. They found that the mean volume of blood drawn for the 578 tests exceeded that requested by the hospital laboratory by 19.0% ± 1.8% per test. The main factors of overdraw was: collection in blood containers without fill-lines, lighter weight infants and critically ill infants being cared for in the NICU.|$|E

In laboratory, a beetle was found to devour 17. 75 + 5. 0 late larval instars of Ae. albopictus per day.
