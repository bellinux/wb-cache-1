40|$|Understanding and {{modeling}} the wildlife-livestock interface {{is essential for}} controlling emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). The contact rate between hosts is a key parameter for mathematical modeling of EIDs dynamics. Because modifications of the contact rate can modify greatly the epidemiologic dynamic, {{it is important to}} take into account its seasonal variability. We developed a distribution model based on satellite telemetry and remote sensing data to directly evaluate the dynamic of contacts between wild birds and domestic poultry in African villages. In the Inner Niger Delta of Mali, five <b>Comb</b> <b>ducks</b> (Sarkidiornis melanotos), were tracked with satellite transmitters providing GPS data for seven months. We used 250 -meter spatial resolution and 8 -day temporal resolution remotely sensed environmental indicators to model the distribution of these wild birds with the MAXENT method. For each 8 -day period, we estimated the potential contacts between wild and domestic birds by calculating the number of villages harbouring predicted suitable habitats for <b>Comb</b> <b>ducks.</b> A period of increased potential contacts occurred {{at the end of the}} dry season when wild birds were looking for the last suitable habitats. <b>Comb</b> <b>ducks</b> subsequently performed regional movements to reach their breeding grounds during the rainy season. We could directly estimate the seasonal variation of potential contacts between <b>Comb</b> <b>ducks</b> and domestic poultry. It allowed us to identify period of potential transmission and spread of pathogens by wild birds. The estimation of the dynamic of contacts between wild and domestic animals with our method could feed epidemiological models of the wildlife-livestock interface. (Texte intégral...|$|R

In addition to being generally perching and cavity-nesting, they also have fairly wide, rounded wings, elongated tails, and sometimes also relatively long legs. Many of the species exhibit {{a great deal of}} iridescent coloration in their plumage, even among females, and in a few species nearly the entire body plumage is iridescent. In some of these brilliantly colored forms, such as the <b>comb</b> <b>duck,</b> muscovy duck, and the spur-winged goose, there is a great difference in the sizes of the sexes even though they may be very similar in plumage patterning. In spite of their brilliant plumages, males of {{only a few of the}} species exhibit definite eclipse plumages, probably in part because most of the forms are tropical, with long or irregular breeding seasons. Pair bonding is generally seasonally established in the species that breed in temperate climates, while in the more tropical and seemingly more primitive species the pair bonds are weak and in a few cases apparently even nonexistent. The patterns of the downy young are typically well marked and characterized by white or yellow spots and stripes on a darker background; in many species they are not readily separable from the downy young of dabbling ducks. The two tribes are obviously closely related, and taxonomists are not agreed on which group some species such as the ringed teal, pink-eared duck, and Brazilian teal should be included in. However, to merge the tribes would make a comparatively large tribe and tend to obscure the well-defined differences in the behavior patterns and breeding biologies of these two groups...|$|R

50|$|This common {{species is}} unmistakable. It {{is one of}} the largest species of duck. Length can range from 56 to 76 cm, {{wingspan}} ranges from 116 to 145 cm and weight from 1.03 to 2.9 kg. Adults have a white head freckled with dark spots, and a pure white neck and underparts. The upperparts are glossy blue-black upperparts, with bluish and greenish iridescence especially prominent on the secondaries (lower arm feathers). The male is much larger than the female, and has a large black knob on the bill. Young birds are dull buff below and on the face and neck, with dull brown upperparts, top of the head and eyestripe. Knob-billed ducks are generally larger in size when compared to <b>comb</b> <b>ducks,</b> and flanks are usually lighter (light grey, in females sometimes whitish).|$|R
40|$|The {{biodiversity}} in {{aquatic systems}} are indirectly controlled by their nutrient dynamics. The abundance of phytoplanktons and zooplanktons {{depends on the}} availability of nutrients such as nitrates, phosphates and silicates since these are the building blocks for their further growth. The phytoplanktons act as prey for the next higher trophic level including various fishes and other small organisms. One of the factors that enchant the migratory birds at some particular locations is the availability of the species of organisms that they prey on. In this paper a preliminary analysis is done to explore the nutrient dynamics of selected tropical aquatic systems in order to correlate the arrival of migratory birds at those locations. Water samples are collected from coastal region of Aleppey, Purakkad and Koonthankulam Bird Sancturay. The latter two sites are the important destination of many migratory water birds including Pallus Gull, Heuglins Gull, Bar-headed goose, <b>Comb</b> <b>Duck</b> and Spot Billed Pelican.

40|$|The Chhilchhila Wildlife Sanctuary (76036 - 76046 E and 29052 - 30000 N), {{situated}} in Kurukshetra District of Haryana provides an important wintering {{ground for a}} diverse range of wetland birds. This study was carried out from April 2009 to March 2012 to document the diversity of wetland birds. Altogether 57 species of wetland birds belonging to 37 genera and 16 families were recorded from the study area. Family Anatidae dominated the wetland bird community with 13 species. Among recorded species, 33 were winter migrants, two summer migrants and 22 were resident species. The winter migratory birds did not arrive at this wetland in one lot and at one time. Instead, they displayed a definite pattern specific to species for arrival and departure. They appeared at the wetland during mid-October and stayed up to early April. The composition of birds in major feeding guilds {{in the study area}} showed that the insectivore guild was the most common with 35. 09 % species, followed by carnivore (29. 82 %), omnivore (19. 30 %), herbivore (10. 53 %) and piscivore (5. 26 %). Among the birds recorded in this study area, Darter (Anhinga melanogaster) and Painted Stork (Mycterialeucocephala) were Near Threatened species. <b>Comb</b> <b>Duck</b> (Sarkidiornismelanotos), listed in Appendix II of CITES, was also spotted in the sanctuary.
