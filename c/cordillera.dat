5|$|Being {{the highest}} {{tropical}} <b>cordillera</b> in the world, the <b>Cordillera</b> Blanca boasts {{a variety of}} ecosystems, from humid tropical through subalpine to alpine and tundra. The valleys and mountain slopes are covered with scattered high Andean forests and puna grassland.|$|E
5|$|It also occurs {{throughout}} northern Colombia at low elevations {{and into}} western Venezuela west of Lake Maracaibo {{and at the}} foot of the western part of the Venezuelan Coastal Range east to Guatopo National Park. Hylaeamys megacephalus occurs further to the east in the eastern portion of the coastal range, separated by the coastal Eastern Caribbean Dry Zone. There is a record from the Orinoco Delta of northeastern Venezuela, well within the range of Hylaeamys megacephalus, but Musser and colleagues suggest that this is based on mislabeled specimens. The species has also been found on the narrow strip between the Llanos and the Andes (<b>Cordillera</b> Oriental and <b>Cordillera</b> de Mérida) in eastern Colombia and northwestern Venezuela. The unforested Llanos separate these areas from Hylaeamys populations. Hylaeamys perenensis does, however, occur further south along the eastern foothills of the <b>Cordillera</b> Oriental in Colombia and it is possible that the two overlap in this area.|$|E
5|$|Cerro Blanco {{is part of}} the Central Volcanic Zone and {{is located}} at the {{southern}} limit of the Puna. It forms a volcanic unit together with the Aguada Alumbrera ignimbrite, at {{the eastern edge of the}} <b>Cordillera</b> de San Buenaventura. Rocks beneath this unit include dacitic–trachyandesitic volcanites 9–7 mya old and an igneous-metamorphic granitic basement containing orthogneiss, quartz of Neoproterozoic-early Paleozoic age, containing paleozoic mafic to ultramafic volcanic inclusions. The <b>Cordillera</b> de San Buenaventura is formed from lava domes and volcanic complexes of intermediary composition of Upper Miocene–Quaternary age. During the Miocene-Pleistocene, the isotope and chemical composition of areal magmas has moved away from arc like magmas to distinctly water-poor and unoxidized petrologies. This finding is consistent with a hot mantle forming after delamination of the crust and migration of the arc.|$|E

5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Sutorius eximius {{grow in the}} soil singly or {{scattered}} among leaf litter. A mycorrhizal species, the bolete has been recorded growing in association with plants from various genera, including Dicymbe, Dipterocarpus, Fagus, Hopea, Quercus, Shorea, and Tsuga. The species has been recorded from North America, Costa Rica, and Indonesia. In Costa Rica, where it usually associates with the endemic oaks Quercus seemannii and Q.copeyensis, the lilac-brown bolete can be locally abundant in the <b>Cordillera</b> Central and the <b>Cordillera</b> de Talamanca. Additional locations with collections {{that have not been}} confirmed by DNA analysis include Guyana, Japan, China. Although S.eximius has been reported from Thailand, molecular analysis of Thai collections suggests that they represent a distinct, as-yet unnamed species.|$|E
5|$|Huascarán National Park {{protects the}} <b>Cordillera</b> Blanca, {{which is the}} world's highest {{tropical}} mountain range. Located in the central Peruvian Andes, the park's 340,000 hectares cover an elevational range from around 2,500 m to the several snow-capped peaks above 6,000 m. Among those peaks are Huascarán (Peru's highest at 6,768 m), Huandoy, Copa, Huantsán and many others.|$|E
5|$|Official {{efforts to}} protect this area started in 1960, when Senator Augusto Guzmán Robles {{presented}} a bill to the Peruvian Congress {{for the creation of}} Huascarán National Park. In 1963, the Forestry and Hunting Service (Servicio Forestal y de Caza) presented a preliminary project for the delimitation of the <b>Cordillera</b> Blanca National Park, covering an area of 321,000 hectares. On February 18, 1966 a government resolution prohibiting the logging and hunting of native species {{in the area of the}} <b>Cordillera</b> Blanca was issued. Later that year, the Patronage of Huascarán National Park was formed in Yungay. In 1967, Curry Slaymaker and Joel Albrecht, Peace Corps volunteers, formulated delimitation proposal on an area of 85,000 hectares; and simultaneously, the Forest Regional Service of Huaraz established the vicuña and queen-of the-Andes surveillance zone for an area of approximately 10,000 hectares. Finally, on July 1, 1975 Huascarán National Park was created by decree No. 0622-75-AG, with an extension of 340 000 hectares.|$|E

5|$|The most {{prominent}} geographical feature, {{at the highest}} elevation in the park, is the mountain range <b>Cordillera</b> de Tarros. This mountain has several caves and is the origin of several streams. Elevations inside the park range between 1550 and 3500 meters above sea level.|$|E
5|$|During the Tauca phase, {{water levels}} in Laguna Miscanti {{were higher than}} today; shorelines formed from an event in Ch'iyar Quta lake; saline lakes formed in the Lipez area, and water levels rose in the Guayatayoc-Salinas Grandes basin and lakes at Uturuncu and Lazufre. Some Atacama Altiplano lake levels {{increased}} by , and evidence exists at the Quebrada Mani archeological site for a higher water supply 16,400–13,700 years ago. During the Tauca, greater flow occurred in rivers in the Atacama region; more precipitation fell in the Rio Salado valley; the excavation of the Colca Canyon may have been aided by an increased water supply, and glaciers advanced in the <b>Cordillera</b> de Cochabamba. A moraine formed at Hualca Hualca; the Choqueyapu II glacier in the Eastern <b>Cordillera</b> advanced; moraines formed from glacial advances in Argentina (including the Sierra de Santa Victoria); basal sliding glaciers formed at Sajama; landslide activity in northwestern Argentina decreased; the climate grew wetter over the southern Amazon; flooding in the Río Paraguay-Parana basin and precipitation and forest cover in Pampa del Tamarugal increased; erosion occurred along the Pilcomayo, {{and an increase in}} Pacific plankton was probably linked to increased runoff (and an increased nutrient supply) from the Andes. A glacial advance in central Chile around 15,000 years ago, also associated with increased precipitation and the Lake Tauca period, was probably triggered by tropical circulation changes.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Jack Souther {{produced}} {{a synthesis of}} volcanism in the Canadian <b>Cordillera</b> and delineated several Neogene to Quaternary volcanic belts throughout British Columbia. One of these was the linear Anahim Volcanic Belt, which included the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field at its eastern end. However, its origin {{had not yet been}} understood. In 1979, two volcano tectonic models had been proposed by Jack Souther, Mary Bevier and Richard Armstrong. This included a hotspot and a propagating crack controlled by stress fields related to large-scale plate tectonics of western North America.|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the crustal structure of the central sector of the Betic <b>Cordilleras,</b> by means of deep reflection seismic profiles and gravimetry, shows that the Moho is nearly planar. The continental crust of the Iberian Massif probably continue below the Betic <b>Cordilleras.</b> The boundary of the Betic <b>Cordilleras</b> crust and the thin crust ofthe A/boran Sea is made along a narrow E-W trending band where the Moho probably dips more than 60 s N. This band is located 10 to 20 Km north of the coast line. The crust in the Betic <b>Cordilleras</b> has detachments, and the large folds with northward vergence, related to the mam topographic features of the Internal Zones, do not deform the deep reflectors.

5|$|Harrya chromapes is an ectomycorrhizal species, and its fruit bodies grow singly to {{scattered}} on soil. They are usually found in forests containing conifers, Betulaceae and oak in North America. The North American distribution includes eastern Canada south to Georgia and Alabama, including Mexico. It extends west to Michigan and Mississippi. The fruit season extends from late spring to late summer. In Costa Rica, where the species associates with oak, {{it has been}} recorded from the <b>Cordillera</b> Talamanca, the Poás and Irazu Volcano. It is also in Guatemala. In Asia, it is known from India (West Bengal), Taiwan, Japan, and in China, where it associates with trees from the beech and pine families.|$|E
5|$|The Laramide orogeny {{affected}} all {{of western}} North America {{by helping to}} build the American <b>cordillera.</b> The Kaibab Uplift, Monument Upwarp, the Uinta Mountains, San Rafael Swell, and the Rocky Mountains were uplifted, at least in part, by the Laramide orogeny. This major mountain-building event started {{near the end of}} the Mesozoic, around 75million years ago, and continued into the Eocene period of the Cenozoic. It was caused by subduction off the western coast of North America. Major faults that trend north–south and cross the canyon area were reactivated by this uplift. Many of these faults are Precambrian in age and are still active today. Streams draining the Rocky Mountains in early Miocene time terminated in landlocked basins in Utah, Arizona and Nevada but there is no evidence for a major river.|$|E

5|$|When the Treaty of Paris, {{under which}} Spain was to cede the Philippines to the United States, {{was made public}} in December 1898, Luna quickly decided to take {{military}} action. He proposed a strategy {{that was designed to}} trap the Americans in Manila before more of their troops could land by executing surprise attacks (guerrilla warfare) while building up strength in the north. If the American forces penetrated his lines, Luna determined that he would wage a series of delaying battles and prepare a fortress in northern Luzon, particularly the <b>Cordillera.</b> This, however, was turned down by the High Command, who still believed that the Americans would grant full independence.|$|E
5|$|Boletus auripes {{somewhat}} resembles B.aurantiosplendens, but {{the latter}} species {{has a more}} variably colored cap that can be orange, brownish orange, or yellowish, and variable degrees of stem reticulation. B.hortonii has a similar color scheme but lacks reticulation on the stem. B.auripes bears a superficial resemblance in coloration to the Costa Rican species B.lychnipes, known only from a limited area in the northern <b>Cordillera</b> de Talamanca. The latter species may be distinguished {{by the lack of}} reticulations on the upper half of the stem, a brown or salmon-pink staining reaction on the stem in response to handling, and microscopically by a conspicuously sterile margin and prominent pseudocystidia. Retiboletus retipes is set apart from B.auripes by a darker cap, tubes that lack an olive tinge, and a stem that has more prominent reticulation extending down to the base. In contrast to B.auripes, B.impolitus has a floccose (wooly) or tomentose cap surface, and lacks an olive tinge on the tubes.|$|E
5|$|In April 1896, Chile ordered another armored cruiser, , and six torpedo boats. Naval {{historian}} Robert Scheina {{states that}} Argentina replied {{in the same}} month with , a near-sister ship to Garibaldi which was under construction in Italy. However, {{he notes that the}} small time lapse between the orders makes it difficult or impossible to know if this, the opposite, or either are true. As historian Jonathan Grant writes, the Argentines may have moved first to secure a definite, if momentarily tenuous, advantage over the Chilean Navy. In May 1898, the Chilean government found that the Argentines were planning on acquiring one, then two, Garibaldi-class cruisers. With tensions extremely high and war seemingly imminent, the two countries agreed to submit their boundary disputes to the British, which led to the <b>Cordillera</b> of the Andes Boundary Case 1902 (Argentina, Chile). They also signed pacts which led to the resolution of the Puna de Atacama dispute. As the former arbitration took much time, the naval arms race, though it slacked during the time of eased tension which came with the agreements, continued.|$|E

5|$|Subsequently, Aguinaldo {{suffered}} successive, disastrous {{losses in}} the field, as he retreated northwards. On 13 November 1899, Aguinaldo decided to disperse his army and begin conducting a guerrilla war. General José Alejandrino, one of Luna's remaining aides, stated in his memoirs that if Luna {{had been able to}} finish the planned military camp in the Mountain Province and had shifted to guerrilla warfare earlier as Luna had suggested, Aguinaldo might have avoided having to run for his life in the <b>Cordillera</b> Mountains. For historian Teodoro Agoncillo, however, Luna's death did not directly contribute to the resulting fall of the Republic. In his book, Malolos: The Crisis of the Republic, Agoncillo stated that the loss of Luna showed the existence of a lack of discipline among the regular Filipino soldiers and it was a major weakness that was never remedied {{during the course of the}} war. Also, soldiers connected with Luna were demoralized and as a result eventually surrendered to the Americans.|$|E
5|$|The name Level Mountain is a {{reference}} to the gently sloping plateau surface of this large volcano. It was adopted on December 21, 1944 as identified in the Canada Department of Mines Summary Report, 1925, Part A. This name appeared on the National Topographic System (NTS) map 104/NE but was replaced with the name Level Mountain Range on August 14, 1952 upon production of NTS map 104J. The reason for this name change was that cartographers were uncertain as to what the name Level Mountain referred to. They cited H. S. Bostock's 1948 report Physiography of the Canadian <b>Cordillera,</b> With Special Reference to the Area North of the Fifty-Fifth Parallel in which Bostock stated that Level Mountain is a small prominent mountain range on the Nahlin Plateau. Despite this misinterpretation, Level Mountain is still the local name for the entire massif and the Level Mountain Range for a range of steep peaks centered on the volcano's summit.|$|E
5|$|The ancestral origins {{for this}} species stem from eastern North America, where species {{richness}} of ambystomatids are highest. The following biogeographic interpretation on {{the origins of}} A.macrodactylum into western North America is based on a descriptive account of fossils, genetics, and biogeography. The long-toed salamander's closest living sister species is A.laterale, a native to northeastern North America. Ambystomatidae was isolated to the southeast of the mid-Continental or Western Interior Seaway during the Cretaceous (~145.5–66 Ma). While three other species of the Ambystomatidae (A.tigrinum, A.californiense, and A.gracile) have overlapping ranges in western North America, the long-toed salamander's closest living sister species is A.laterale, a native to northeastern North America. It has been suggested that A.macrodactylum speciated from A.laterale after the Paleocene (~66–55.8 Ma) with the loss of the Western Interior Seaway opening an access route for a common ancestor into the Western <b>Cordillera.</b> Once situated in the montane regions of western North America, species had to contend with a dynamic spatial and compositional ecology responding to the changes in altitude, as mountains grew and the climate changed. For example, the Pacific Northwest became cooler in the Paleocene, paving the way for temperate forest to replace the warmer tropical forest of the Cretaceous. A scenario for the splitting of A.macrodacylum and other western temperate species from their eastern counterparts involves Rocky Mountain uplift in the late Oligocene into the Miocene. The orogeny created a climatic barrier by removing moisture from the westerly air stream and dried the midcontinental area, from southern Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
