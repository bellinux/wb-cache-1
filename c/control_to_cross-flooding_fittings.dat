In the paper, the authors describe a security management framework for access <b>control</b> <b>to</b> the network resources. They deal with this in three steps. In the first part, user access <b>control</b> <b>to</b> a given network is discussed. In the second part, access <b>control</b> <b>to</b> the network resources, both by self-usage and delegation, revocation of delegation is presented. The third part explains the access <b>control</b> <b>to</b> the resources belonging to the other networks. A neural network based model is developed for intrusion detection to overcome most of the limitations of the existing systems...|$|R
