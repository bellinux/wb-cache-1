Under Henry II perhaps a third of the country was royal forest.|$|E

Readily adaptable to cultivation, Alloxylon flammeum prefers a site with good drainage and responds well to extra moisture and fertilisers low in phosphorus. It is listed nationally as vulnerable under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) as most of its habitat has been <b>cleared</b> <b>for</b> agriculture and logging.|$|E

5|$|Although much of Massachusetts {{had been}} <b>cleared</b> <b>for</b> agriculture, leaving only traces of old-growth forest in {{isolated}} pockets, secondary growth has regenerated in many {{rural areas as}} farms have been abandoned. Currently, forests cover around 62% of Massachusetts. The areas most affected by human development include the Greater Boston area {{in the east and}} the Springfield metropolitan area in the west, although the latter includes agricultural areas throughout the Connecticut River Valley. There are currently 219 endangered species in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{breakout}} crew in {{the weapons}} storage began {{to inspect the}} missiles, an early-arriving transport crew hooked up the pylons and towed them away without inspecting or ensuring that the missiles had been inspected or <b>cleared</b> <b>for</b> removal. The munitions control center failed to verify that the pylon had received proper clearance and inspection and approved the pylon for loading on the B-52 at 0925. After taking eight hours to attach the pylons, the aircraft with the missiles loaded then remained parked overnight at Minot for 15 hours without the special guard required for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|At 18:56:06 MST, {{the flight}} was <b>cleared</b> <b>for</b> the VOR/DME-C {{instrument}} approach to the airport, whereupon it proceeded to the Red Table VOR, executed a sequence of designated step-down maneuvers and began final approach to the runway. As it continued its descent past the missed approach point– where the runway must be in sight to continue– the pilots had still not visually located the runway in the increasing darkness and snow showers. At 19:01:57 MST, while in a steep left bank, the aircraft crashed into the terrain, killing all 18 persons on board.|$|E

5|$|Before development, Hamersley was {{a remote}} {{district}} covered in jarrah, marri, banksia and other vegetation {{typical of the}} Swan Coastal Plain, with small areas <b>cleared</b> <b>for</b> small-scale agriculture such as market gardening and poultry farming. By 1974, six {{years after the first}} subdivision, Hamersley was home to the district's first community hall, an annual parade and fair which were broadcast on Perth TV and radio, an active progress association, and its own newspaper, the Hamersley Gazette, a forerunner to today's Stirling Times. Rapid growth further north removed the focus from Hamersley, which was completed in 1981 and has remained relatively stable since then.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} eight months of {{operational}} trials, a total of 16 in-flight engine failures and 49 unscheduled engine changes punctuated the ongoing engine dilemma and delayed the in-service date until February 1957, roughly two years late. The Britannia received a fair amount of attention in both the popular press and the British House of Commons, especially when it was revealed that BOAC had contemplated fitting Rolls-Royce Tynes to their fleet of Douglas DC-7s as an interim measure until the Britannia was <b>cleared</b> <b>for</b> service.|$|E
5|$|Erica Durance plays Lois Lane, Chloe's {{cousin who}} comes to Smallville to {{investigate}} Chloe's supposed death and stays with the Kents.

Durance was cast three days before filming began; although she could initially appear in only four episodes, according to the film division of Warner Bros., after negotiations her character was <b>cleared</b> <b>for</b> more appearances.|$|E

5|$|In its later years, {{students}} building Bonfire used logs {{donated by}} local landowners who wanted their land <b>cleared</b> <b>for</b> construction or farming. Over 8000logs were used {{each year in}} the late 1990s, taking about 5000students a combined 125,000man-hours to construct. After being doused in 700lb (318kg) of jet fuel, applied by staff members at A's Fire Training School, the Yell Leaders, Drum Majors, and Redpots then lit the stack with torches the night before the annual football game against the University of Texas when at home and two nights before the game when it was played in Austin.|$|E
5|$|Most of the German bombers {{had passed}} over {{and had an}} {{altitude}} advantage over French fighters trying to gain height to intercept. Skirmishes were few and far between, but some French units suffered heavy losses. For the attack, the Germans had used the new C-250 Flammbombe (Flame Bomb) which had only been <b>cleared</b> <b>for</b> use 24 hours earlier. The incendiary bomb did some damage to hangars and parked aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Tropical dry {{deciduous}} {{forests are}} found {{in all parts of}} the plains. Since much sunlight reaches the ground, shrubs and grasses are also abundant. Large tracts of these forests have been <b>cleared</b> <b>for</b> cultivation. Tropical thorny forests, consisting of widely scattered thorny trees, mainly babool are mostly found in the southwestern parts of the state. These forests are confined to areas which have low annual rainfall (50–70cm), a mean annual temperature of 25–27°C and low humidity.|$|E
