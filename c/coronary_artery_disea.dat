However, discrete potentials that occnr during systole have not been previously described. Tbe purpose of thi. s {{study was to determine the}} significance of discrete systolic potentials during VT in patients with coronary artery disease. Methods and Results: Twenty-seven patients witb a mean age of 66 ± 12 years (± standard deviation) who bad <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>disea.</b> se underwent radiofrequency catbeter ablation of 42 VTs that had a mean cycle lengtb of 486 ± 78 msec. The only criterion used to select target sites for ablation was concealed entrainment, wbich was present at 92 sites. Thirly-five of tbe 42 VTs (83 %) were snccessfully ablated. A discrete systolic potential was recorded during 7 of tbe 42 VTs (17 %). In all cases, the interval between tbe discrete systolic potential and the next QRS complex was equal to tbe stimulus-QRS interval during concealed entrainment. At all seven sites wbere a discrete systolic potential was recorded, delivery of radiofrequency energy resulted in successful ablation of tbe VT. Conclusion: Discrete systolic potentials may be present in patients witb coronary artery disease in approximately 17 % of VTs in whicb tbere is concealed entrainment. If tbe interval between tbe discrete systolic potential and the next QRS complex matches tbe stimulus-QRS interval during concealed entrainment, delivery of radiofrequency energy is likely to result in successful ablation of tbe VT.

MethodsOf 303 consecutive patients undergoing <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass grafting with 3 -vessel coronary disease and a dominant right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> tributary of an infarcted nonischemic territory, 154 were randomized to right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> revascularization and 149 to no right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> grafting. In all cases, standard on-pump surgical myocardial revascularization was performed. ResultsOverall hospital mortality was 2 of 154 versus 1 of 149 (P =. 97); no difference in in-hospital outcome was observed between the 2 groups. At follow-up, cardiac event–free survival was 84 of 152 in the right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> grafting series and 62 of 148 in the non–right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> grafting group (P =. 20).

The association between the <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> ectasia and inflammatory markers has been shown, however there is nodata related to Pentraxine 3 (PTX- 3). In this study, we investigated the association between serum PTX- 3 and high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels in patients with <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> ectasia. Patients and Methods: The study population consisted of 66 patients who underwent coronary angiography with the suspicion of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease and 32 controls. Patients were divided in two groups as the <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> ectasia group (n= 34) and <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease group (n= 32). PTX- 3 and hs-CRP levels were measured. Results: Serum PTX- 3 levels were comparable between <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease and <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> ectasia groups (0. 67 ± 0. 29 vs. 0. 66 ± 0. 34, p= 0. 63), <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease and <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> ectasia groups had significantly increased PTX- 3 levels when compared to the control group (0. 67 ± 0. 29 vs. 0. 32 ± 0. 24, p< 0. 001; 0. 66 ± 0. 34 vs. 0. 32 ± 0. 24, p< 0. 001; respectively).

Daoud et al. reported that 12 % of 57 <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> aneurysms ruptured [9]; however, their report was an autopsy review. In the <b>Coronary</b> <b>Artery</b> Surgery Study Registry, Swaye et al. did not detect any cases of ruptured aneurysm in 978 patients [3]. The natural history of an infective <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> aneurysm is more unclear {{than that of a}} normal aneurysm; however, there is a higher tendency of rupture in a mycotic aneurysm [8]. Prompt diagnosis and treatment should be performed for an infective <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> aneurysm. Otherwise, Swaye et al. reported that most patients with a <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> aneurysm had significant stenosis or occlusion. According to these reports, <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> angiography should be performed to detect a fatal <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> stenosis or occlusion in every patient with <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> aneurysm. Because the present case developed moderate pericardial effusion and severe <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease, in addition, stopping of the bleeding was not detected on arrival; the patient underwent emergency surgical treatment.|$|R
40|$|The {{authors have}} {{reviewed}} {{the literature in}} search of the coexistence of single <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> with significant <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease. Two cases of single right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> are described. In both, the anomalies were unsuspected and diagnosed roentgenographically in life. Both patients had angina pectoris, positive graded-exercise stress tests, and hemodynamically significant obstruction or occlusion to the <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries.</b> In neither case was the stenosis proximal or amenable to bypass surgery. Congenital anomalies of the <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> occur more frequently than is generally supposed. Major anomalies, such as anomalous origin of one or both <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> from the pulmonary artery, present in the neonatal period or infancy. Minor anomalies may be compatible with a normal life span and be discovered incidentally at surgery, autopsy, or cardiac catheterization. Alexander and Griffiths (1) reported the incidence of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> anomalies in autopsies performed in a general hospital over a 10 -year period as 2. 85 per 1000 autopsies. In their experience of 54 cases, no case of single right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> was encountered. A total of 165 cases of single <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> was reported up to 1974 (2). The concurrence of single <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> with other congenital anomalies was noted by Murphy (3) in his review of 79 cases of single <b>coronary</b> <b>artery.</b> Approximately one-third of these cases was associated with other anomalies. Hillestad and Eie (4) reported three cases of single <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> diagnosed angiographically, each case being associated with a bicuspid aortic valve. The present report is of two patients who were subjected to cardiac catheterization and selective coronary arteriography during the investigation of angina pectoris. Both were found to have a single right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> with significant <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease...|$|R

40|$|Between January 1979 and December 1981, 142 {{patients}} undergoing {{surgery to}} the right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> agreed to have repeat coronary arteriography one year later. Thirty patients underwent combined endarterectomy and bypass grafting {{to the right}} <b>coronary</b> <b>artery.</b> The patency of these grafts was {{compared with that of}} grafts in 69 patients undergoing direct grafting to the right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> and in 43 with grafting to the posterior descending <b>coronary</b> <b>artery.</b> There were two hospital deaths and one late death. No patients developed new inferior Q waves on the electrocardiogram. Repeat coronary arteriography at one year showed that 21 (72 %) of the 29 grafts were patent after combined endarterectomy and bypass grafting to the right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery.</b> Sixty three (94 %) grafts to the right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> and 40 (93 %) grafts to the posterior descending <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> were patent at one year. Direct grafts to the right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> or its posterior descending branch had a significantly higher patency rate at one year than grafts to the endarterectomised right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery.</b> Graft patency after the combined procedure correlated with the extent of atherosclerosis in the posterior descending <b>coronary</b> <b>artery.</b> It was not influenced by treatment with platelet antagonists. Endarterectomy of the right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> was most successful when it allowed a single graft to perfuse both the large posterior descending and left ventricular branches...|$|R
