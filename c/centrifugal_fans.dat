5000|$|If, for example, a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fan</b> moves 1,000 CFM at 70°F it {{will also}} move 1,000 CFM at 200°F. The air volume {{delivered}} by the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fan</b> is not affected by density. However, since the 200°F air weighs {{much less than the}} 70°F air, the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fan</b> will create less static pressure and will require less brake horsepower. When a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fan</b> is specified for a given CFM and static pressure at conditions other than standard, an air density correction factor must be applied to select the proper size fan to meet the new condition. Since 200°F air weighs only 80% of 70°F air, the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fan</b> will create less pressure. To get the actual pressure required at 200°F, the designer would have to multiply the pressure at standard conditions by an air density correction factor of 1.25 (i.e., 1.0 / 0.80) to get the system to operate correctly. To get the actual horsepower at 200°F, the designer would have to divide the brake horsepower at standard conditions by the air density correction factor.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical investigation on the aerodynamic performance {{according to the}} application of splitter blades in an impeller of a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fan</b> used for a refuse collection system. Numerical analysis of a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fan</b> {{was carried out by}} solving three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the shear stress transport turbulence model. A validation of numerical results was conducted by comparison with experimental data for the pressure and efficiency. From analyses of the internal flow field of the reference fan, the losses by the reverse-flows were observed in the region of the blade passage. In order to reduce these losses and enhance fan performance, two splitter blades were applied evenly between the main blades, and centrifugal impellers having the different numbers of the main blades were tested with their application. Throughout the numerical analyses of the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fan</b> with splitter blades, {{it was found that the}} reverse-flow regions in the blade passage can be reduced by controlling the main blade numbers with splitter blades. The application of splitter blades in a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fan</b> leads to significant improvement in the overall fan performance...|$|R
