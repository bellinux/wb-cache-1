5|$|The high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes were {{designated}} in 1998. When they opened, {{they were the}} first anywhere in a rural area of Colorado. In a departure from the usual practice, the diamonds were painted in the right lanes rather than the left, so that Roaring Fork Transportation Authority (RFTA) buses <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> and from their stops more easily.|$|E
5|$|Nevada was refloated on 12 February 1942 and {{underwent}} temporary repairs at Pearl Harbor so she <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Puget Sound Navy Yard for a {{major overhaul}} and modernization. This was completed in October 1942, and it changed the old battleship's appearance so she slightly resembled a South Dakota from a distance. Her 5"/51s and 5"/25s were replaced with sixteen 5"/38 caliber guns in new twin mounts. Nevada then sailed for Alaska, where she provided fire support from 11–18 May 1943 for the capture of Attu.|$|E
5|$|Planners {{believed}} the SEALs <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Abbottabad and back without {{being challenged by}} the Pakistani military. The helicopters {{to be used in}} the raid had been designed to be quiet and to have low radar visibility. Since the U.S. had helped equip and train the Pakistanis, their defensive capabilities were known. The U.S. had supplied F-16 Fighting Falcons to Pakistan on the condition they were kept at a Pakistani military base under 24-hour U.S. surveillance.|$|E

Mr Blobby's new game became Blob A Job which saw him as a handyman and viewers having to guess which celebrity's house he would be redecorating later on that afternoon.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} The Undertaker against Batista in a Last Man Standing Match for the World Heavyweight Championship. At one spot, Undertaker leg dropped Batista through an {{announce}} table. Towards the end, the two fought up the entrance ramp, where Batista speared to The Undertaker off the stage. Neither man <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> their feet before the referee's count of ten; in result, the match {{ended in a}} draw. Due to WWE regulations, titles can't change hands in a Last Man Standing match by a draw, so The Undertaker remained champion.|$|E
5|$|Twilight confronts Discord, {{accusing him}} of {{cheating}} since he destroyed the labyrinth before they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> {{the end of the}} game. However, Discord counters this by reminding her that, while he had hinted at where the Elements were, he never said anything about them being in the labyrinth. As he disappears and teases the ponies with another storm of chocolate rain, Twilight realizes that a line from Discord's riddle actually refers to Ponyville itself.|$|E

5|$|With the Matabele wars over, Burnham {{decided it}} was time to leave Africa and move on to other adventures. The family {{returned}} to California. Soon after, Fred traveled to Alaska and the Yukon to prospect in the Klondike Gold Rush, taking with him his eldest son Roderick, who was then 12 years old. On hearing of the Spanish–American War, Burnham rushed home to volunteer his services, but the war had ended before he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the fighting. Burnham returned to the Klondike having played no part in the war. Colonel Theodore Roosevelt regretted this as much as Burnham and paid him a great tribute in his book.|$|E
5|$|At the time, much of {{the rural}} ricelands had been {{abandoned}} due to war and lay fallow. The Americans pressured Diem to assume control of such lands and distribute it to the new settlers and {{to allow them to}} start their new lives and ease the overcrowding in the camps, but no action was taken in 1954. At the time, there was a severe wastage of personnel due to the placement of refugees in land that was inappropriate to them. Vietnamese officials had resolved to place the settlers in land similar to their northern origins so that they could be productive, but bureaucratic difficulties hampered COMIGAL and no plan was produced. Throughout 1954, 60% of the new arrivals identified themselves as having an agrarian background, but only 20% of the total refugees were placed in arable farming areas, meaning that at least 40% of the northerners were in areas not appropriate for their skill set. There were also severe problems in finding and then distributing farming equipment to the northerners so that they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> work and resuscitate the agricultural sector that was hindered by the war.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to other}} {{industrial}} {{cities in the}} U.S., Omaha suffered severe job losses in the 1950s, more than 10,000 in total, as both the railroad and meatpacking industries restructured. Stockyards and packing plants were located closer to ranches, and union achievements were lost as wages declined in surviving jobs. Many workers left the area if they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> other jobs. Poverty deepened {{in areas of the}} city whose residents had depended on those jobs, specifically North and South Omaha. At the same time, with reduced revenues, the city had less financial ability to respond to longstanding problems. Despair after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968 contributed to riots in North Omaha, including one at the Logan Fontenelle Housing Project. For some, the Civil Rights Movement in Omaha, Nebraska evolved towards black nationalism, as the Black Panther Party was involved in tensions in the late 1960s. Organizations such as the Black Association for Nationalism Through Unity became popular among the city's African-American youth. This tension culminated in the cause célèbre trial of the Rice/Poindexter Case, in which an Omaha Police Department officer was killed by a bomb while answering an emergency call.|$|E

25|$|Actually {{for some}} experts (like Tripodi) the {{question}} arises how it all <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the end {{in such a short}} time and without major incidents: no loss of life happened.

Grasshopper was able to get over the sandbank into deeper water, where she anchored, though striking ground repeatedly. She was unable to go to the assistance of Hero and within 15 minutes the distress signals from Hero ceased. Next morning Grasshopper observed Hero completely wrecked.

25|$|Pickett {{crossed the}} ford just {{as some of}} Munford's cavalrymen were falling back with Kellogg's brigade {{pressing}} them closely. Pickett appealed to his cavalrymen {{to hold back the}} Union attackers long enough so he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the front. A small group of the Confederate cavalrymen, led by Captain James Breckinridge who was killed, charged the advancing Union soldiers, giving Pickett enough time to pass using the horse's head and neck as a shield. Getting to the ford a little later than Pickett, Fitzhugh Lee was unable to cross as Kellogg's men had occupied Ford's Road by that time. Lee then tried to attack the roadblock with Rosser's reserve division but they failed to breach the Union line. So Lee deployed the division north of Hatcher's Run {{in an effort to keep}} the Union force from using Ford's Road to reach the South Side Railroad.|$|E
25|$|On 4 October 1948, while Bhumibol {{was driving}} a Fiat Topolino on the Geneva-Lausanne road, he {{collided}} with the rear of a braking truck 10km outside Lausanne. He injured his back, suffered paralysis in half {{of his face and}} incurred cuts on his face that cost him the sight of his right eye. Both the royal cremation and coronation had to be postponed once more. While he was hospitalised in Lausanne, Sirikit visited him frequently. She met his mother, who asked her to continue her studies nearby so that Bhumibol <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know her better. Bhumibol selected for her a boarding school in Lausanne, Riante Rive. A quiet engagement in Lausanne followed on 19 July 1949, and they were married on 28 April 1950, just a week before his coronation. Their wedding was described by The New York Times as “the shortest, simplest royal wedding ever held in the land of gilded elephants and white umbrellas”. The ceremony was performed by Bhumibol's ageing grandmother, Savang Vadhana.|$|E
