After the cotton exchange closed {{for the duration of the}} war, Jim worked as an inspector at Napier's engineering works, which made shell cases that were later filled with explosives. He volunteered to be a fireman at night and often watched Liverpool burning from his rooftop observer's position. Between 1940 and 1942, Liverpool endured 68 air-raids, which killed or injured more than 4,500 of the population and destroyed more than 10,000 homes. After the war he worked as an inspector for Liverpool Corporation's <b>Cleansing</b> <b>Department</b> before returning to the cotton trade in 1946.|$|E
2500|$|An {{order was}} placed with Barningham and Co. in August 1893 for rails, {{sleepers}} and wagons for a [...] gauge railway system, {{which would be}} used to deliver lime to the lime store and carry the compressed sludge to the old river bed for disposal. Barningham had previously supplied equipment to the Corporation for a light railway on Carrington Moss for the <b>Cleansing</b> <b>Department.</b> Track laying was carried out by the Paving Sub Committee and Highways Department. The Corporation also paid the Ship Canal company to construct Davyhulme Wharf, which would enable coal and chemicals to be delivered to the site. This required the railway to be extended and a road to be built to serve the wharf, and this work was not completed until October 1894, although the works had begun to treat sewage in January 1894.|$|E

He kept the nickname because, according to Cheese and Egg in episode 2.1, [...] "They're all bloody Delilahs". Another character, who appeared in all 20 episodes, was Smellie Ibbotson. He started as the scavenger on the tips but was later promoted to be Bloody Delilah's lapdog, reporting on who was skiving {{and what they were}} up to. Not everyone liked Smellie, not just because he was smelly, but also since he was difficult to understand (as he had no teeth).|$|R
5000|$|Beyond the arm, {{the west}} bank {{contained}} Canal Street Dye Works and a dockyard with a dry dock in 1851. The end of the basin was quite large, and the Manchester Flint Glass Works was located beyond it. The {{eastern side of the}} basin is marked as a brick field, where clay would have been extracted. By 1891, the brick field had become a Bedstead and Safe Works, with an electric engineering works and St Jude's Church occupying {{the east side of the}} plot. The glass works had expanded to cover the former docks, and the basin had been reduced to a narrow finger. By 1951, the site to the north of the side arm was occupied by a shirt factory, the Corporation <b>Cleansing</b> <b>Department's</b> garage and an engineering works, where cylinder grinding and welding were carried out by 1953. The whole area north of Mill Street bridge had been redeveloped by the time the 1972/1981 map was published.|$|R

Graffiti in memory of Dax are quite common in Milan, but have also {{appeared}} elsewhere and abroad; they usually read [...] "Dax vive" [...] ("Dax lives", in Italian) or [...] "Dax odia ancora" [...] ("Dax still hates"). One of these graffiti, portraying Cesare's face, used to be painted on the Darsena in Milan, former port of the Navigli canal system; its removal by Milan's <b>cleansing</b> <b>department</b> in 2007 was subject to much controversy and was strongly condemned both by activist associations and {{by members of the}} government.|$|E
50|$|The Central Stables {{was home}} to some of Liverpool's mightiest horses until 1960 when the last of the working horses were 'phased out'. From this time onwards the yard {{was home to}} the {{motorised}} bin wagons of the Corporation <b>Cleansing</b> <b>department</b> and just a few reminders of the past - the proud horses which were retained to haul the City of Liverpool State Coach on grand civic occasions. The Central Stables were finally closed in 1993 and put on the market as a prime development opportunity, but they had not seen their last horse - in late April 2000 they were used briefly to house overnighting horses from around Britain for the Millennium Liverpool May Horse Parade.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Management {{of acute}} and chronic wounds has {{significantly}} altered {{in the last}} decade but little {{attention has been paid to}} the solution used for cleansing the wounds. Therefore, the present study aimed to compare the effects of tap water, distilled water, and normal saline for wound <b>cleansing</b> in emergency <b>department.</b> Methods: This is a double-blind randomized clinical trial with a 10 -day follow up. Patients who had superficial wounds were randomly divided into 3 treatment groups: normal saline, distilled water, and tap water. The wounds were cleansed using a 20 - 60 milliliter syringe with an 18 gauge needle. All the patients were discharged with the same antibiotic and were followed 48 hours and 10 -day to determine the presence or absence of infection symptoms. The evaluated outcomes were infection incidence in the first 48 hours and 10 days after being discharged. Results: 1200 patients were included in the present study (57 % male, average age 25. 5 ± 11. 0 years). 43 (3. 5 %) patients showed infection symptoms in the first 48 hours. Ten (2. 5 %) patients were in normal saline treated group, 15 (3. 7 %) patients were in distilled water group, and 18 (4. 4 %) patients were in tap water treated group (p= 0. 32). 13 (3. 2 %) patients in normal saline group, 20 (4. 9 %) patients in distilled water group and 23 (5. 6 %) in the tap water group did not take their antibiotics. Prevalence of infection were higher in patients who did not take antibiotics (p < 0. 001). The 10 -day follow-up revealed that all the patients were recovered and showed no infection symptoms. Conclusion: The results of the present study showed that the prevalence of infection in using the 3 agents (normal saline, distilled water and tap water) for cleansing wounds was similar. Therefore, drinking water could be considered as an alternative for cleansing wounds...|$|R
50|$|Hanratty's {{early years}} were troubled. Long before his {{trial for the}} A6 murder, {{he had already been}} {{described}} as a retard, a psychopath, and a pathological liar. By the age of 11 he had been declared ineducable at St James Catholic High School, Burnt Oak (now Barnet), although his parents steadfastly refused to accept he was in any way mentally deficient and successfully resisted attempts to have him placed in a special school. After leaving the school in 1951 at the age of 15, Hanratty, still illiterate, joined the Public <b>Cleansing</b> <b>Department</b> of Wembley Borough Council as a refuse sorter. In July of the following year he fell from his bicycle, injuring his head and remaining unconscious for 10 hours; he was admitted to Wembley Hospital, where he remained for nine days.|$|E

40|$|Determination of exact {{standard}} time with direct measurement procedures is particularly difficult in companies {{which do not}} have an adequate environment suitable for time measurement studies or which produce goods requiring complex production schedules. For these companies new and special measurement procedures need to be developed. In this study, a new time estimation method based on different robust algorithms of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is developed. For the proposed method, the products that have similar production processes were chosen from among the whole product range within the <b>cleansing</b> <b>department</b> of a molding company. While using ANNs, to train the network, some of the chosen products' {{standard time}} that had been previously measured is used to estimate the standard time of the remaining products. The different ANN algorithms are trained and four of them, which are converged the data, are stated and compared in different architectures. In this way, it is concluded that this estimation method could be applied accurately in many similar processes using the relevant algorithms...|$|E
30|$|Bantar Gebang {{composting}} site in Bekasi, Indonesia, is {{treating the}} waste from the Kramat Jati central market in Jakarta. The waste contains vegetable, fruits, and straw fruit baskets. The composting technology {{used at the}} plant is the windrow composting method. Responding to market demand, output product is pelletized and packed in 60 -kg packages used for agriculture, such as, cassava plantation, palm oil plantation, and rice farms. The received amount of market waste is 200 TPD. The final product is 30 TPD of pelletized compost fertilizer. About 60 – 70  % of the products is sold at 1, 000 Indonesian Rupiah or about 106 USD/tonne. The residue is disposed of in a nearby landfill or sold by scavengers for plastic recycling. The Jakarta government pays 11 USD/tonne of waste tipping fee. 20  % of this fee is paid as land rent fee to the Bekasi city government and the remaining 80  % is used for paying the plant operators (Pikiran Rakyat 2011). The tipping fee increases about 5  % annually (Kompas 2010). Costs related to transportation, such as, the 4 -tonnes capacity trucks and the truck drivers’ wages, are paid by the <b>cleansing</b> <b>department.</b> 160 people, who mostly used to work as scavengers in the nearby landfill, are paid 127 USD per person. Similar to the other Indonesian composting plants in this study, the discount rate of 8.12  %, the inflation rate of 12.26  % and fertilizer price increase of 10  % were assumed in the financial calculation. Results show that the NPV of this project is 40, 573, 301 USD or about 202, 867 USD per ton waste treatment capacity. The CBR is 1.77 and amortization period may be reached on the 6 th year of the production lifetime. It reviews that the project {{is estimated to be}} profitable.|$|E
