40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{potential}} of electric vehicles (EVs) {{in a context of}} a pilot test in Belgium, consisting of car sharing services managed and exploited in small communities. Part of a broader testing activity in the framework of the e-Mobility NSR project, the test had the objective of metering EVs’ charging and consumption in real daily transport operations, but soon it acquired new meanings. It shaped EV sharing services at a small scale, directly managed by the users, which also share energy and maintenance costs. The chosen context was the cohousing, a special type of collaborative housing, and four ones were selected in Flanders: two urban units and two larger semi-urban ones. The two urban communities received a pre-paid card for reserving and using EVs provided by Cambio, a Belgian car-sharing company. The other two cohousings received two EVs and a <b>charging</b> <b>box,</b> organising and running an internal car-sharing system for the duration of one year. During the tests, quantitative and qualitative data were collected. The paper reports the intermediate results, identifying potential EV sharing consumers, based on their behaviour and attitudes in relation to the condition of the local context in which they live...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{increase}} {{in the use of}} mobile phones especially on G. S. M networks today, which according to NCC’s report presently in Nigeria have over 138 Million subscribers, coupled with inadequate and sporadic electricity supply, hence for constant operation, a power solution more robust than power bank (which still requires initial charging with electricity or generator) for private and commercial use has been developed with solar as its primary source of energy. This paper focuses on the design, construction and operational advantages of portable solar powered phone <b>charging</b> <b>box</b> (PCB), for mobile phone users as an alternative to what is used today in a reformed and modernized form at school campuses, bus stops, motor parks, shopping complexes, markets, office complexes, airports, social gatherings to mention a few, where pockets of phone charging points with conventional loop wiring of about 10 - 25, 13 A sockets supported with 900 W/ 1. 2 KVA generator is used to charge people mobile phones say at a minimum rate of fifty Naira per phone.

40|$|We {{propose a}} model of a battery {{switching}} station (BSS) for electric buses (EBs) that captures the predictability of bus operation. We schedule battery charging in the BSS so that every EB arrives to find a battery ready for switching. We develop an efficient algorithm to compute an optimal schedule. It uses dual decomposition to decouple the charging decisions at different <b>charging</b> <b>boxes</b> so that independent subproblems can be solved in parallel at individual <b>charging</b> <b>boxes,</b> making the algorithm inherently scalable as the size of the BSS grows. We propose a direct projection method that solves these subproblems rapidly.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the {{validity}} and potential capacity of a modeling and simulation environment for the nonresonant plasmonic terahertz (THz) detector based on the silicon (Si) field-effect transistor (FET) with a technology computer-aided design (TCAD) platform. The nonresonant and "overdamped" plasma-wave behaviors have been modeled by introducing a quasi-plasma electron <b>charge</b> <b>box</b> as a two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) in the channel region only around the source side of Si FETs. Based on the coupled nonresonant plasma-wave physics and continuity equation on the TCAD platform, the alternate-current (AC) signal as an incoming THz wave radiation successfully induced a direct-current (DC) drain-to-source output voltage as a detection signal in a sub-THz frequency regime under the asymmetric boundary conditions with a external capacitance between the gate and drain. The average propagation length and density of a quasi-plasma have been confirmed as around 100 nm and 1 x 10 (19) /cm(3), respectively, through the transient simulation of Si FETs with the modulated 2 DEG at 0. 7 THz. We investigated the incoming radiation frequency dependencies {{on the characteristics of}} the plasmonic THz detector operating in sub-THz nonresonant regime by using the quasi-plasma modeling on TCAD platform. The simulated dependences of the photoresponse with quasi-plasma 2 DEG modeling on the structural parameters such as gate length and dielectric thickness confirmed the operation principle of the nonresonant plasmonic THz detector in the Si PET structure. The proposed methodologies provide the physical design platform for developing novel plasmonic THz detectors operating in the nonresonant detection mode. open 3...|$|R
