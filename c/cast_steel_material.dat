40|$|The {{globalisation}} of trade, {{environment and}} technology requires a continuous improvement of all products in functionality and exact adaptation of materials {{to the conditions}} of use. Therefore the range of materials was increased and {{the race of the}} designers as well as the material suppliers in finding the best solution for new challenges is also a challenge for the steel foundries. This paper shows two examples of new <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> types and points out the aspects which are considered for research, development and for the introduction of newly developed <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> grades into commercial production. It also shows the technical and commercial issues that are very often denied {{for the benefit of the}} final product from the very beginning. One example is a <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> for offshore structures with high yield strength in low temperature application and good weldability. The second example is a new creep resistant <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> grade used in advanced steam power plants at higher temperatures and pressures for increase of efficiency and decrease of environmental pollution. No company or even industrial sector can afford the expensive development of new processes and materials. Therefore operators, manufacturers and material suppliers have to work together in a network of international projects which make the contribution of a single company effective for the benefit of all partners involved, also for competitors on the market. The role of steel foundries and the <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> <b>materials</b> within this new type of competition of materials is an important part for being successful with the development of new or advanced processes and technologies. ...|$|R

These <b>cast</b> <b>steels</b> are of a pearlitic matrix with uniformly distributed hypereutectoid cementite precipitates. Apart from hypereutectoid cementite {{very often}} transformed ledeburite also occurs in the microstructure of these <b>cast</b> <b>steels.</b> Such <b>cast</b> <b>steels</b> contain chromium (app. 1 %) and nickel (app. 0. 5 %) as alloy additions and sometimes their silicon content is increased. The presence of molybdenum is also permissible (app. 0. 4 %). The basic problem in application of these steels for structural elements constitutes their insufficient crack resistance. An improvement of mechanical properties by changes of morphology of hypereutectoid cementite and transformed ledeburite precipitates {{by means of the}} heat treatment application was the aim of this study. G 200 CrNiMo 4 - 3 - 3 <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> was the investigated material. Changes in the morphology of hypereutectoid cementite and transformed ledeburite obtained due to the heat treatment are described in detail in the present paper. An influence of the microstructure changes on impact toughness of the investigated <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> is presented. Investigations performed within this study will serve for the microstructure optimisation on account of functional qualities of this <b>cast</b> <b>steel...</b>|$|R
40|$|The study {{discloses}} {{the results}} of microstructural examinations, testing of magnetic properties and hardness measurements as cast and after heat treatment conducted on the Fermanal <b>cast</b> <b>steel.</b> A characteristic feature of this <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> is its density lower by about 10 % than the density of carbon <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> [4]. It has been proved that the factor deciding about the composition of microstructure (fraction of ferrite and austenite) is the content of aluminium. The matrix totally austenitic is present in <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> containing from 0, 8 to 0, 9 % C, from 22 to 24 % Mn, and from 4, 5 to 5, 5 % Al. The magnetic properties examined on samples of the Fermanal <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> were determined by spectroscopy of the Mössbauer effect with isotope 57 Fe. The magnetic properties represented by a mean value of the hyperfine magnetic field Bhf and relative magnetic permeability were determined. It has been stated {{that the level of}} magnetic properties of the Fermanal <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> depends on the content of ferrite. The effect of the parameters of solutioning and ageing on the <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> microstructure and hardness after modification with additions of B, Ti and Nb was investigated...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} {{evaluation of}} effect annealing on structure and mechanical properties of ledeburitic ast steel. The paper presents evaluation of influence of grain normalization and {{the inclination to}} precipitate the hypereutectoid cementite in Widmannstätten structure in G 200 CrMoNi 4 - 6 - 3 <b>cast</b> <b>steel.</b> Design/methodology/approach: The heat treatment has been planned {{on the basis of}} CCT diagram prepared for that alloy <b>cast</b> <b>steel.</b> Four temperatures of heat refining have been applied. Basic research of G 200 CrMoNi 4 - 6 - 3 <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> included metallographic analysis and mechanical properties (hardness and impact strength tests). Findings: The evaluation has been carried out for four annealing temperatures, i. e. 850 °C, 900 °C, 950 °C and 1050 °C. The test material has been G 200 CrMoNi 4 - 6 - 3 hypereutectoid <b>cast</b> <b>steel.</b> At all annealing temperatures in the structure of <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> the precipitation of hypereutectoid cementite along grain boundaries of former austenite took place. At the temperature of 850 °C one may observe the coagulated hypereutectoid cementite precipitates inside of primary grains of austenite. Whereas beginning from the temperature of 900 °C the cementite in G 200 CrMoNi 4 - 6 - 3 <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> forms distinct „subgrains” inside of primary grains of austenite. Research limitations/implications: The annealing for four temperature and the new heat treatment of G 200 CrMoNi 4 - 6 - 3 <b>cast</b> <b>steel.</b> Practical implications: G 200 CrMoNi 4 - 6 - 3 <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> of ledeburite class is used mainly for rolls production. Any data related to the structure and mechanical properties of that <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> are precious for the manufacturers and users of the mill rolls.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the paper is to characterise low cycle fatigue of high – {{chromium}} martensitic 9 %Cr <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> for advanced steam power plants. Design/methodology/approach: The research on fatigue life {{within the scope of}} small amount of cycles to failure at room temperature was carried out on high - chromium, martensite GX 12 CrMoVNbN 9 - 1 <b>cast</b> <b>steel.</b> Fatigue tests were performed for the assumed five levels of controlled amplitude of total strain εac i. e. 0. 25; 0. 30; 0. 35; 0. 50 and 0. 60 %. The loads applied in the performed experiment oscillated sinusoidally with the stress ratio R = - 1 and frequency f = 0. 2 Hz. Fatigue tests were run by means of Instron 8501 hydropulser. Tests pieced for fatigue tests were round and threaded. Findings: The investigated <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> is strongly weakened during low cycle fatigue. The period of stabilization was not revealed during the cyclic loading of GP 91 <b>cast</b> <b>steel.</b> Moreover, it has been proved that the course of weakening process of the <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> does not depend on the level of strain. In the examined <b>cast</b> <b>steel’s</b> weakening process three stages can be distinguished which are characterized by a different weakening speed. Research limitations/implications: The present study is focused on the influence of low cycle fatigue on the fatigue life of GX 12 CrMoVNbN 91 <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> at room temperature. The investigated <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> is characterized by the lack of stabilization period, which makes the research results considerably difficult to work out. Originality/value: The fatigue characteristics of GX 12 CrMoVNbN 9 - 1 <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> is presented within the scope of small amount of cycles to failure. Fatigue life of the investigated <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> was described using the equations of Ramberg-Osgood and Manson-Coffin-Basquin...|$|R

40|$|Non {{magnetic}} {{foundry materials}} such as the austenitic stainless <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> had not been used for abrasion resistant materials, because their hardnesses were very low. Usually, ceramics, cermets and cemented carbides are used for the abrasion resistant materials {{even though they are}} expensive compared with foundry materials. In this study, WC powder were inserted by using the austenitic stainless <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> (JIS SCS 13 A) and the austenitic cast iron (JIS FCA-NiCr 202) for producing surface hardened non magnetic materials. The melting temperature (pouring temperature) is lower in the austenitic cast iron than in the austenitic stainless <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> while the fluidity of the melts is superior in the austenitic cast iron. For the WC powder inserted specimens, the hardness, the abrasion resistance and the magnetic property were examined. As a result, {{it was found that the}} hardness in the region of inserted WC powder was much higher than that of base metals of the <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> and the <b>cast</b> iron, and that the magnetic permeability did not change by the inserting. Especially, a lot of WC powder was found to dissolve into the base metal in the <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> than in the cast iron. In the case of the <b>cast</b> <b>steel,</b> Fe 3 W 3 C compound phase having high hardness of HV 800 was formed in the region of inserted WC powder. The hardness in the region of inserted WC powder was higher in the <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> than in the cast iron, because the <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> contained a lot of chromium compared with the cast iron...|$|R
