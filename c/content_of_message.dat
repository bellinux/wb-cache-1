Literature confirms that information and communication technologies can extend the reach of healthcare. In this paper, we present an SMS-based social network that aims to help health workers to interact with other medical professionals through topic-based message delivery. Topics describe interests of users and the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>message.</b> A message is delivered by matching message content with user interests.

Today information security is the challenging issue that touches many areas such as computers and communication. Cryptography is such a way that make sure of integrity, availability and identification, confidentiality, authentication of user and as well as security and privacy of data can be provided to the user. In this paper we have defined and analysed various cryptographic symmetric algorithms like DES, Triple DES, Blowfish, AES and IDEA and asymmetric key cryptographic algorithms like RSA.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{security}} of data {{become a major}} issue in the present days, there are different dimensions of security in this paper we will discuss one of the major properties of security. The signcryption is one of the techniques to secure your data by encrypting it. It was first introduced by Zheng in 1997 based on DLP. The signcryption combines the techniques of digital signature and encryption which reduces computational cost and communication overhead. The Signcryption scheme verifies the integrity of message before decryption of cipher text it also provides how the message can be verify by third party without reading the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>message.</b> Many researchers have given their signcryption scheme to achieve security goals like confidentiality, unforgeability, integrity, forward secrecy and public verification every scheme is having their own limitations. This paper represents the cryptanalysis of popular signcryption scheme in terms of major security goals alpng with the communication overhead and computational cost...|$|E
40|$|Recently, retweeting {{is found}} to be an {{important}} action to understand diffusion in microblogging sites. There have been studies on how tweets propagate in networks. Previous studies have shown that history of users interaction and properties of the message are good attributes to understand the retweet behavior of users. Factors like <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>message</b> and time are less investigated. We propose a model for predicting users who are more likely to retweet a particular tweet using tweet properties, time and estimates of pairwise influence among users. We have analyzed retweet cascades and validated that structural, social, behavioral and history of nodes are equally important for influence estimation among users. We develop a model which ranks the users based on the likelihood of the users to be potential retweeters. We have performed experiments on real world Twitter sub-graphs and our results validate our proposed work satisfactorily. We have also compared our results with existing works and our results outperform them...|$|E

Their syntactic and semantic properties don’t provide evidence for deriving this kind of elliptical clause from a complete clause. An analysis in terms of syntactic reconstruction of the missing material is therefore inadequate. Thus, the elliptical clause in both constructions (gapping and VRA) has a specific syntactic behaviour and must be assigned an independent status in the grammar, more precisely the status of a fragmentary clause, that is a syntactic unit having a propositional <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>message</b> type, but an incomplete syntax.

40|$|The novel {{technique}} titled as “signcryption ” {{announced by}} Yuliang Zheng, completes both the functionality of signature scheme and encryption scheme in single logical step with a reduced amount of computational cost and communication overhead than Signature-then-encryption scheme. A number of signcryption scheme {{has previously been}} announced by many researchers nonetheless each scheme has their own restriction. This paper is grounded on an elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC) implemented using java technology with reduced amount of computational cost and communication overhead than the existing techniques. It not only offers the integrity, authenticity, confidentiality, unforgeability, non-repudiation beside that forward secrecy and public verification. By forward secrecy of message confidentiality, unauthorized person cannot be able to mine the original message content even if the long-term private key of the sender is compromised. It doesn‟t be affect the confidentiality of the previously stored message. By the public verification, Anyone can confirm the sender signature without reading the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>message</b> since the message is in encrypted format.

30|$|The content {{stored in}} the {{non-volatile}} memory is used for generating actual addresses which point to soft messages {{stored in the}} volatile memory (RAM). An actual address can easily be determined by adding an offset address to the base address. A decoder retrieves a soft message by accessing the RAM via an actual memory address. The number of addresses required to retrieve all the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>message</b> RAM equals {{to the number of}} 1 -components in the H-matrix. Each 1 -component in H represents a RAM address. All the RAM addresses needed for the decoder to obtain the soft messages are stored in the non-volatile memory. Without optimization, the size of this non-volatile memory is equal to Z × U bits, where Z is the address width (Z ≧ log 2 N) [5], and U is the total number of 1 -components in an H-matrix with code length N. In QC-LDPC block codes, the non-volatile memory for recording the RAM addresses can be replaced by a reduced 2 -D Y-matrix, in which only shift values are stored. With the content of Y and an AGU [5], the original memory space can effectively be reduced.

We construct mechanism that enables Bob to provide trapdoors to Carol such that Carol, given encrypted data and malware signature, is able to check whether encrypted data contains malware signature, without decrypting it. We refer to this mechanism as Public-Key Encryption with Delegated Search SPKE.

40|$|Social {{media has}} become an {{important}} means of everyday communication. It is a mechanism for “sharing” and “resharing” of information. While social network platforms provide the means to users for resharing/reblogging (aka retweeting), it remains unclear what motivates users to share. Predicting the spread of content is quite important for several purposes such as viral marketing, popular news detection, personalized message recommendation and on-line advertisement. Social content systems store all the information produced in the interactions between users. However, to turn this data into information {{that allows us to}} extract patterns, {{it is important to consider}} the different phenomena involved in these interactions. In this work, two phenomena that influence the evolution of networks are studied for Twitter: diffusion of information and communication among users. Previous studies have shown that history of interaction among users and properties of the message are good attributes to understand the retweet behavior of users. Factors like <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>message</b> and time are less investigated. We propose a prediction model for retweet actions of users. It formulates a function which ranks the users according to how receptive they are to a particular message. The function generates a confidence score for the edges joining the initiator of the message and the followers. Two different pieces of information propagate through different users in the network. We divide the task of calculating confidence score into two parts. The first part is independent of the test tweet. It models transmission rate of the tie between the initiator and the follower. We call this as ‘Pairwise Influence Estimation’. The second part incorporates the tweet properties and user activeness as per time in the ranking function. The proposed model exploits all the dimensions of information dif-fusion process-influence, content and temporal properties. We have captured local aspects of diffusion. It has been observed that users do not read all the messages on their site. This results in shortcomings in the above models. Considering this, we first study the temporal behavior of users’ activities, which directly reflects their availability pertaining to the upcoming post. Also, as it is a continuous task of predicting retweet behavior, we design a user-centric, and temporally localized incremental classification model by considering the fact that users do not read all their tweets. We have tested the effectiveness of this model by using real data from Twitter. We demonstrate that the new proposed model is more accurate in describing the information propagation in microblog compared to the existing methods. Our model works well when we consider different classes of users depending on their activity patterns. In addition, we also investigate the parameters of the model for different classes of users. We report some interesting distinguishing patterns in retweeting behavior of users...|$|E
