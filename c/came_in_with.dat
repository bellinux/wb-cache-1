5|$|On August 9 {{against the}} Kansas City Royals, Molina <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> two outs and the bases loaded. After drawing a 1–0 count against Peter Moylan, a brief delay {{occurred}} when a stray kitten had {{made its way}} onto the outfield. On the very next pitch to Molina, he hit it 387 feet into the left field seats for a go-ahead grand slam. This was the 5th grand slam of his career, tying him with Tim McCarver for second-most career grand slams by a Cardinals catcher. This also {{proved to be the}} deciding hit in this game, as the Cardinals held up to win, 8–5.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{travelled}} to London to play Surrey at The Oval. Tallon <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> {{the score}} at 6/553, {{and held up}} his end, scoring an unbeaten 50 as his partners steadily fell and Australia were bowled out at 632. Tallon had some difficulty in English conditions as he sustained a bruised right finger when he lost sight of a Ray Lindwall bouncer on a misty morning during the match and was hit as he put hand over his face for protection, with the ball running away for four byes. Tallon took two catches in the second innings as Australia won the match by an innings, but he also conceded 24 byes in Surrey's match total of 336.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{ended with}} two non-first-class matches against Scotland. In the first match, McCool <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> Australia 4/91 {{and put on}} 109 with Arthur Morris to {{consolidate}} the innings. When McCool was out for 52 and Morris for 109, the Australians collapsed and lost 6/36 to end with 236. McCool took 1/19 and 1/20 as Australia enforced the follow on and completed an innings victory. In the second match, McCool took 3/31 as the hosts made 178 after batting first. He opened the innings with the bat and made 108 in three hours, with 13 fours. Australia declared at 6/407 and McCool took 0/19 in seven overs as Australia wrapped up the tour with another innings victory.|$|E

5|$|After {{the army}} was marshaled, Skanderbeg would not permit the {{trumpets}} to give the signal for battle until he saw Ali Pasha advancing. After looking upon the Albanian army, the Pasha ordered his army to charge {{with one of the}} units ahead of the rest. The Albanian front line retreated; Skanderbeg sent a body of horsemen to prevent the line from breaking and marshaled the retreating troops back to their places. Ali Pasha believed he had the Albanians trapped. The same situation occurred on the left wing and, when all were in their places, the army prepared for the main offensive. As it began, the wings were fiercely led on by Thopia and Golemi and pushed back the Ottoman wings. In the centre, Skanderbeg assaulted a selected battalion. When the proper signal was given, the 3,000 horsemen hidden in the woods sprang out and charged into the Ottoman rear, causing large parts of their army to rout. The wings of the Albanian army turned towards the Ottoman centre's flanks. Ajdin Muzaka, having charged the Turkish centre, was met by fierce resistance and the Turks continued to pour in fresh forces until Vrana Konti <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> his reserves and decided the battle. The Turkish army was surrounded. The Ottoman front ranks were annihilated except for 300 soldiers. Ali Pasha's personal battalion fled although the commander nearly met his death.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 200708 season, she made her senior debut for the New South Wales Breakers in the Australian {{domestic}} one-day league. She was used as a specialist batsman in the top-order, as Leonie Coleman, a wicket-keeper in the Australian squad, also played for New South Wales. She made her debut against South Australia and was unsuccessful to begin with, scoring only 24 runs in her first five innings. After one month at senior level, she broke through with a match-winning performance in her sixth senior game. After Queensland had made 170, Healy <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the score at 5/99 after 32 overs, with 18 overs remaining. She raised the run rate, scoring 41 not out from 50 balls, with eight fours, shepherding the tail-enders and guiding her state to a two-wicket win with 17 balls to spare.|$|E
5|$|Booth {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for New South Wales against Queensland in the 195455 Sheffield Shield. He made a duck {{in the first}} innings before adding 19 in the second. New South Wales won, but Booth was dropped when the Test players returned from international duty. Booth was recalled a month later for a match against Len Hutton's English cricket team at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Arthur Morris and Bill Watson had to withdraw at late notice and Booth was asked to play, having already started his day's work as a teacher at Hurlstone Agricultural College. He caught a train and arrived at the ground {{more than half an}} hour after the start of play, by which time New South Wales had collapsed to 3/12. New South Wales fell further to 5/26 before Booth <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> a borrowed cap and bat to join Peter Philpott. They put on an 83-run partnership, and Booth eventually finished the innings unbeaten on 74 as the hosts folded for 172. Booth made a duck in the second innings and took his maiden first-class wicket as New South Wales defeated Hutton's men. It was only the tourists' second loss for the campaign, and the last match in Booth's debut season.|$|E

5|$|Hassett <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> {{the score}} at 2/117 and {{together}} with Morris saw Australia to the close at 2/153. Morris was unbeaten on 77 and Hassett 10. The next day, the pair took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand was broken when Young trapped Hassett lbw for 37 after 134 minutes of batting. As the Australians had dismissed their hosts cheaply {{on the first}} day and were already well in the lead, they {{had plenty of time to}} complete a victory, so Hassett and Morris had no need to take undue risks and scored at a sedate pace. The following batsmen were unable to string together substantial partnerships and Australia ended at 389. When England batted again, Allan Watkins pulled Doug Ring to the leg side and straight into the hands of Hassett, who did not need to move from his position on the boundary, leaving England at 6/167. The home team were eventually out for 188 and Australia thus sealed the series 40 with an innings victory.|$|E
5|$|Miller was rested for the nine-wicket {{win against}} Warwickshire. He {{returned}} against Lancashire. On the final day, Lancashire batsman Jack Ikin had reached 99 after being repeatedly hit by bouncers. Bradman took the new ball {{and gave it}} to Miller, who refused to bowl, saying that he felt Ikin deserved a century. The Australian skipper gave the ball to Lindwall, who promptly removed Ikin for 99. Miller had a light workload for the match, scoring 24 and 11, and taking a total of 1/32 from 16 overs. In the next game, he <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> Australia in difficulty at 5/133, and scored 55 in faster than even time against Durham in the last match before the Fifth Test. The match was a two-day fixture that was not given first-class status. Miller took 1/17 as the hosts fell to 5/73 in reply to Australia's 282 when rain ended the match {{at the end of the}} opening day.|$|E
5|$|The {{momentum}} swung in Australia's favour. Harvey scored 112, while Loxton made 93, {{hitting a}} further five sixes from Laker. Lindwall added 77 {{late in the}} afternoon as Australia finished at 9/457 on the fourth day, having added 394 in one day's play. At the start of the second innings, Miller bowled a tight opening spell and the English openers scored only five from his six overs as they tried to establish a solid start. Miller took 1/53 in the second innings, removing Bedser and catching Compton yet again as Australia was set a world record chase of 404 on the final day in just 345 minutes. A 301-run second wicket partnership between Morris and Bradman set up the run-chase and Miller <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the score at 2/358. He made only 12 but Australia won by seven wickets to set a new world record and take a 3–0 series lead.|$|E

5|$|Booth scored 127 not {{out against}} Somerset, {{and in the}} next match against Lancashire, he was caught behind for 99 from the bowling of another Brian Booth. He played consistently, with two more half-centuries to earn his debut in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford in place of Colin McDonald. The series was evenly poised at 11, and Australia batted first on a pitch that {{initially}} assisted fast bowling. The surface was tinged with green and England fielded a pace line-up that included Brian Statham and Fred Trueman. Booth was struck in the torso by his first ball, a bouncer that did not rise as high as was expected. He managed to repel a spearing yorker on the second ball and compiled a battling 46, the second highest score on the difficult pitch, featuring in a partnership of 46the highest in Australia's inningswith Bill Lawry. Australia managed only 190 on the bowler-friendly pitch. Booth only managed nine in the second innings before Australia retained the Ashes after an English collapse on the final day resulted in a 54-run win. In the drawn Fifth and final Test at The Oval, Booth <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the score at 4/211 after the dismissal of O'Neill for 117. He featured in a 185-run partnership with Peter Burge. Booth was dismissed for 71 while attempting to loft the spin of Tony Lock over the infield, as captain Richie Benaud needed quick runs; observers felt the need to attack cost Booth his maiden Test century. Booth added three more 70s in the closing tour matches before the team returned to Australia.|$|E
5|$|In 1953-54, Ray had {{his most}} {{effective}} season and played in all seven of Victoria’s Shield matches, {{even though there}} were no Test matches for the summer, meaning that all the national team members were available for state selection for the whole season. He played the entire season alongside Neil, and the pair encountered Mick in both matches against Queensland. During the summer, Neil typically batted at No. 3, and Ray usually succeeded him. Despite this, they batted together only four times in 13 innings, as Neil was usually out first. Their first partnership came in the first innings of the second match of the season, against New South Wales. It was brief; Ray came in at 2/93 and scored two runs before falling at 3/97. They then batted together on New Year's Day in the first innings of the next match against South Australia. Ray came in to join Neil after the Victorians had slumped to be 2/5, and after twice coming close to century partnerships for their state in the past, the brothers put on 150 before Neil was out for 88 to leave the score at 3/165. Ray went on to make 110. In the following match against Queensland, Ray <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the score at 2/65 and put on 82 with his brother before he was out for 50. Their only other partnership of the season amounted to 36 runs in the second innings of the return match against New South Wales; Neil was out for 47 as Ray guided the Victorians to their target with five wickets in hand, scoring 106 not out himself. Ray and Neil were also selected for the testimonial match for retiring Australian captain Lindsay Hassett. Neil played for Hassett’s XI while Ray was on the opposition team captained by Arthur Morris.|$|E
5|$|Loxton <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> {{the score}} at 265/5 and {{accompanied}} Morris for 39 further runs before {{he fell to}} the new ball. He appeared uncomfortable with the outswingers and leg cutters of Bedser, and was beaten several times, before Edrich had him caught behind for 15. Lindwall came in and attacked immediately, scoring two fours before falling for nine. He played a cover drive from the bowling of Young, but hit the ball too early and thus launched it into the air, and it was caught by Edrich at cover point to leave the score at 332/7. Morris was then finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for its numerous hooks and off-drives. It took a run out to remove Morris; he attempted a quick run to third man after being called through from the non-striker's end by Tallon, but was too slow for the substitute fielder Reg Simpson's arm. Tallon, who scored 31, put on another 30 runs with Ring, before both were out with Australia's score on 389, ending the tourists' innings. Both were caught by Crapp in slips from the bowling of Hollies and Bedser respectively. Morris had scored {{more than half the}} runs {{as the rest of the}} team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies, who took 5/131. England had relied heavily on spin bowling; Young took 2/118 and of the 158.2 overs bowled, 107 were delivered by the two slow men. Hollies pitched the ball up repeatedly, coaxing the Australians into playing front-foot shots from balls that spun after pitching on off stump.|$|E
50|$|A poll {{released}} by the Des Moines Register days before the caucus was held showed Dean and Gephardt had lost any/all lead in Iowa. In the poll, John Kerry led with 26% of surveyed, Edwards <b>came</b> <b>in</b> second <b>with</b> 23% of surveyed, Dean <b>came</b> <b>in</b> third <b>with</b> 20% of surveyed, and Gephardt <b>came</b> <b>in</b> fourth <b>with</b> 18% of surveyed.|$|R

Wilson's margin over Taft was thus 12.60 percent, whilst Debs <b>came</b> <b>in</b> fourth <b>with</b> 3.99%. <b>In</b> terms of margin, New York was about 2% more Republican than the nation.|$|R

5|$|The pair added 79 before Morris {{fell for}} 105 and Miller was out seven runs later at 4/173. By taking two quick wickets, England {{had put the}} match back in the balance. Batting out of {{position}} in the middle order, Brown came in and helped Hassett to rebuild the innings. Both scored slowly, averaging more than three and half minutes for each run. Hassett was dropped three times before Yardley, who was bowling mainly {{in order to allow}} his frontline bowlers to recuperate, broke through his defences with a yorker, dismissing him for 47 after 175 minutes of batting; the English skipper trapped Brown lbw nine runs later to leave Australia 6/225. Australia recovered to 350 on the second morning, and England were then bowled out on the third morning for 215. Australia's top-order scored quickly and Hassett <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the score at 2/296 after 277 minutes of batting. Yardley bowled Hassett first ball off the inside edge, so Miller came to the crease at 3/296 to face the hat-trick ball. Miller survived a loud lbw appeal to deny the English captain a hat-trick. Australia then declared at 7/460 on the fourth day to leave England a target of 596, which would have taken a world record run-chase for victory. Hassett caught Alec Bedser from the bowling of Bill Johnston as Australia bowled out the hosts for 186 early on the final morning to win by 409 runs.|$|E

But Hunte's return was accurate, low and fast, and Grout was run out by a foot. The last man, Kline, <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> two balls {{remaining}} and the scores level.|$|E
