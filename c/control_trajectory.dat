Methods: This naturalistic {{study focused on}} 241 cancer patients receiving psychological care at psycho-oncology institutions. Data were collected before the initiation of psychological care, and 3 and 9 months thereafter. Latent class growth analysis was applied to identify personal <b>control</b> <b>trajectories.</b> Results: Three personal <b>control</b> <b>trajectories</b> were identified: enduring improvement (41 %), temporary improvement (50 %), and deterioration (9 %). Education and baseline physical symptoms distinguished these trajectories. In the whole group, improvements in personal control were associated with improvements in psychological symptoms. Patients at distinct trajectories reported different levels of psychological symptoms, but {{did not differ in}} their courses of psychological symptoms. Patients in the enduring and temporary control improvement groups experienced significant psychological symptoms reductions over time, whereas patients in the control deterioration group maintained high psychological symptoms. Conclusions: Improvements in personal control seem to depend on initial control level: those who start with the highest control levels show subsequent improvements, whereas those with the lowest control levels show subsequent deterioration.

40|$|We {{survey the}} basic theory, results, and {{applications}} of geometric control theory. A control {{system is a}} dynamical system with parameters called controls or inputs. A <b>control</b> <b>trajectory</b> is a trajectory of the control system for a particular choice of the inputs. A control system is called controllable if every two points of the underlying space can be connected by a <b>control</b> <b>trajectory.</b> Two fundamental problems of control theory include: 1) Is the control system controllable? 2) If it is controllable, how can we construct an input to obtain a particular <b>control</b> <b>trajectory?</b> We shall investigate the first problem exclusively for affine drift free systems. A control system is affine if it is of the form: ẋ=X 0 (x) +u 1 X 1 (x) + [...] . +ukXk(x) where X 0 is the drift vector field, X 1 (x), [...] .,Xk(x) are the control vector fields, and u 1, [...] ., uk are the inputs. An affine system is called drift-free if X 0 = 0. The fundamental theorem of control theory (known as Chow-Rashevsky theorem) states that an affine drift-free control system is controllable if the control vector fields together with their iterated Lie brackets span the entire tangent bundle of the underlying space. We prove this result in the simplest case when the space is 3 -dimensional and k= 2...|$|E

40|$|Inverse {{optimal control}} (IOC) is a {{powerful}} approach for learning robotic con-trollers from demonstration that estimates a cost function which rationalizes demonstrated <b>control</b> <b>trajectories.</b> Unfortunately, its applicability is difficult in settings where optimal control can only be solved approximately. Local IOC ap-proaches rationalize demonstrated trajectories based on a linear-quadratic approxi-mation around a good reference trajectory (i. e., the demonstrated trajectory itself). Without this same reference <b>trajectory,</b> however, dissimilar <b>control</b> results. We ad-dress the complementary problem of using IOC to find appropriate reference tra-jectories in these computationally challenging control tasks. After discussing the inherent difficulties of learning within this setting, we present a projection tech-nique from the original trajectory space to a discrete and tractable trajectory space and perform IOC on this space. <b>Control</b> <b>trajectories</b> are projected back to the origi-nal space and locally optimized.

40|$|Mathematical {{models are}} {{essential}} for chemical processes since they contribute to both identification and manipulation of process mechanisms, e. g. in reaction systems, separation processes and process controls. The methodologies of model-based experiment design aim at reducing the uncertainties of estimated model parameters, and thus, make the identification and use of these models possible. Up to now, sequential optimization approaches have been applied to solve the related extended optimal control problem. In this contribution, a substantial comparison between the sequential and the simultaneous optimization approach for optimal model-based experimental design is presented with respect to convergence behavior and computational load. Moreover, both approaches are compared regarding high order and continuous <b>control</b> <b>trajectories</b> as well as restrictions from the process. Process restrictions, especially regarding state variables and continuity of <b>control</b> <b>trajectories</b> have a tremendous importance {{with respect to the}} practical implementation, but are mostly just touched or totally neglected during the optimization steps so far.

40|$|It has {{recently}} been shown that the minimum energy solution of the control problem for a linear system produces a <b>control</b> <b>trajectory</b> that is nonlocal.

Here we provide {{a solution to the}} problem of optimally controlling a linearized system by deriving a time-varying set that represents all possible control trajectories parameterized by time and energy. As long as the control action terminus is defined within this set, the <b>control</b> <b>trajectory</b> is guaranteed to be local. If the desired terminus of the control action is far from the initial state, a series of local control actions can be performed in series, re-linearizing the dynamics at each new position.

40|$|International audienceObjectives {{in terms}} of {{pollutant}} emissions and fuel consumption reduction have led car manufacturers to enhance the technical definitions of combustion engines. The latter should now be considered as multiple-input multiple-output nonlinear systems with saturated actuators. This considerably increases the challenge regarding the development of optimal control laws under the constraints of constant cost reductions in the automotive industry. In the present paper, {{the use of a}} nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme is studied for the air path control of a turbocharged gasoline engine. Specifically, a zero dimension physics-based model is combined with parameterization of the future <b>control</b> <b>trajectory.</b> The use of Laguerre polynomials is shown to increase flexibility for the future <b>control</b> <b>trajectory</b> at no cost in computational requirements. This increase in flexibility leads to an improvement of the transient response of the closed-loop with respect to traditional approaches. This practical application shows that this approach makes it easier to fine-tune the NMPC scheme when dealing with engine air path control...|$|E
