The length can be calculated based on a bivariate <b>curvilinear</b> <b>regression</b> model using multiple measurement points. This holds promise provided a regression program is used that allows for both bivariate linear and nonlinear regression. A good statistical package that provides this capability is Minitab, which supports second and third degree equations. Regression models for parabolas and exponential curve forms have been developed by NTS in Excel spreadsheet format {{for the benefit of}} measurers who don’t use statistical software. Of particular interest is the parabolic curve. A spreadsheet application of this for parabolic curves has been developed by NTS. The spreadsheet fits a parabola to 4 or more points (up to 10 allowed) using the least squares method and then calculates the limb length (s) using Simpson's Rule to evaluate the definite integral.|$|E

The yield quantity is predominantly affected by variable meteorological conditions, especially by precipitation deficiency. Data were collected from the Research Centre for Cultivar Testing and the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management for the period 1966 - 2005 to evaluate the effect of precipitation conditions on the yield of onions (Allium cepa L.) cultivated in Poland using multiple regression analysis. Verification of the <b>curvilinear</b> <b>regression</b> equation was conducted on the basis of relative forecast error and average relative forecast error. For this equation the ARFE amounted to 9. 6 %. The threshold precipitation value, i. e. the value at which reduction by at least 5 % of the total yield occurs, was determined by <b>curvilinear</b> <b>regression.</b> Reduction of potential yield caused by precipitation deficiency and the frequency of precipitation deficiency were determined.

Methods Indices of religiousness, obtained from a nationwide survey were used as aggregate predictors of provincial suicide rates in weighted linear regressions, and as individual-level predictors of suicide acceptance in logistic regressions.

The ecological association was most pronounced in the least religious {{parts of the country}} giving rise to a <b>curvilinear</b> ecological <b>regression</b> line. Conclusions <b>Curvilinear</b> ecological <b>regression</b> lines arise when mean levels of exposure affect individual risk above and beyond personal exposure i. e. when there is ecological effect modification.

The aim is to understand if any systematic relationships exist between the characteristics of each study and the reported results of linear and <b>curvilinear</b> <b>regressions</b> to examine the multinationality-performance relationship. • Our main finding, robust to different specifications and to different weights for each observation, is that when analysis is based on non-US data, the reported return to multinationality is higher. However, this relationship for non-US firms is usually U-shaped rather than inverted U-shaped. This indicates that US firms face lower returns to internationalization than other firms but {{are less likely to}} incur losses {{in the early stages of}} internationalization. • The findings also highlight the differences that are reported when comparing regression and non-regression based techniques. Our results suggest that in this area regression based analysis is more reliable than say ANOVA or other related approaches. • Other characteristics that influence the estimated rate of return and its shape across different studies are: the measure of multinationality used; size distribution of the sample; and the use of market-based indicators to measure firm performance.

40|$|The {{structure}} of the different categories of multiple consanguineous marriages (MCMs) and their historical variation patterns are analyzed in the Spanish dioceses of Alava (Basque Country) and Sigiienza-Guadalajara (Castile). Consanguineous marriages, up to third cousins, were taken from ecclesiastical dispensations, and the periods studied were 1831 - 1980 for Alava and 1861 - 1980 for Sigiienza-Guadalajara. Significant differences exist in the MCM rates in the two Spanish areas. In this study a model is proposed to prove that in a general population there may be dependence between MCM rates for specific relationships and the frequencies of those types of relationships {{in the form of}} simple consanguineous marriages (SCMs).

40|$|The energy {{expenditure}} of normal and congenitally obese adult female Zucker rats has been measured by continuous indirect calorimetry for periods of 3 - 10 days at ambient temperatures varied from 30 to 5 degrees C. Rectal temperatures were also recorded. Exposure to cold caused no ill-effects in normal or obese rats. The rectal temperatures of obese rats were about 1 degree C {{lower than those}} of normal rats. The rectal temperatures of normal rats did not change measurably with ambient temperature; in obese rats rectal temperature rose slightly as ambient temperature fell.

Energy expenditure per rat was higher in obese than in normal rats at all temperatures. The two slightly <b>curvilinear</b> <b>regressions</b> were nearly 'parallel', with a separation of about 40 kJ/day per rat at the mid-point. This study therefore does not confirm suggestions that obese Zucker rats suffer from a defect in the level of energy expenditure, or in their capacity to increase it when exposed to cold. It is suggested that in both normal and obese rats the level of energy expenditure was determined by thermoregulatory control. The greater heat production of obese rats may have been a response to their lower core temperature. A steady state in which greater heat production is associated with lower core temperature implies lower insulation between body core and surface. This could be due to greater blood flow...|$|R

When using pellets, OT and N were always significantly lower during the night than during the day but when using meal in groups of 40 and 50, OT during the night was almost as high as during the day.

For Fourier and weighted polynomial regressions, the problem is formalized as one of minimization over the cone of Hankel positive definite matrices, and the criterion to minimize is expressed as an elliptic integral.

The idea of different non-linear modelling method is to know which makes more possible to describe more accurate on interacting effects between velocities and tilt angle when compared among modellers. The models, which were used are static analytic approximation model, <b>curvilinear</b> bivariate <b>regression</b> model, Gompertz the classical growth model and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. Accuracy of the models was determined by mean square error (MSE), mean absolute deviation (MAD), bias and R Square.

The difference between the model and the observed value become the forecasting error measurements. For the training data, the lowest MSE, RMSE and better R Square were noted for the Gompertz model.

The dependent variables used in the models were natural logarithms (Loge) of the geometric mean of the somatic cell count for the lactation, 305 day milk production and breed class average for milk from the lactation summary file, and loge of the 24 hour somatic cell count and 24 hour milk production from the test day file. The somatic cell count at both the lactation and test day level increased with age up to approximately ten years and thereafter slowly decreased. The variable "days in milk" was not significantly associated with the lactation average somatic cell count. A curvilinear relationship was found between days in lactation at the time of test and the somatic cell count of 24 hour milk production. The somatic cell count increased until approximately 250 days in lactation and thereafter slowly decreased. It was found that the highest cell counts occurred in summer and the lowest in winter.

40|$|Snow and ice in high {{mountains}} represent {{and important}} water resource {{in many parts}} of the world, especially the dry continental interior of Central Asia. In the Northern Areas of Pakistan, mountain ranges are the primary sources of annually renewed water supplies. They give rise to rivers which are the only significant, sustainable source of fresh water. The Indus basin is drained by the river Indus and its major tributaries, the Kabul, Jhelum, Chanab, Ravi and Sutlej. Snowmelt contributes about 70 percent to the annual flow of these rivers, but is not timed to meet the requirements for crop production, hydroelectric power generation, and other multi-purpose objectives. This situation has led to the development of an irrigation economy that requires effective management of the water resources in these drainage basins. A basic understanding of snow distribution and its contribution to streamflow is needed for effective prediction of flow events. Snowfields between elevation of 2, 500 m and 5, 500 m constitute a small percentage of the area contributing to runoff in the Central Karakoram, Northern Pakistan. However, they are considered to have a higher water content, and to produce runoff for longer periods than snowpacks at lower elevations. The melt regime of a basin may be better understood by examining snowpack recession and runoff hydrograph. Identifying the time of daily peak flow, snow cover/runoff relation and its variation through the season may prove helpful to flow modelling. This study involved taking hydrological and meteorological observations in two small snow-fed basins having different aspects in the basin of Barpu Glacier in the Central Karakoram range of the Himalaya in Pakistan. The conservational network was designed to cover a range of elevations within the experimental basins. This type of network is essential to account for the effects of typography and microclimate on snow hydrology. Patterns of snowmelt runoff examined in two contrasting environments within the Barpu Glacier Basin suggest that topography influences the rate of spring snowmelt in several ways. Aspect and degree of slope modify the winter and spring snowpack by causing unequal rates of ablation. Relief creates an unequal distribution of snow which in turn causes areal variation in the volume of spring melt. Normal linear and <b>curvilinear</b> multiple <b>regression</b> anaylsis is an appropriate method for studying of hydrologic relationships. Snow cover area and subsequent snowmelt runoff can be correlated to estimate streamflow. For a particular catchment, the relationship between area of snow-cover and snowmelt runoff appears to depend on morphometrical factors such as elevation, aspect, slope, and drainage density. However, for each basin a different empirical relation exists between snow cover and snow-melt runoff. The logarithmic relationships between snow-cover and snowmelt runoff indicates a substantial increase in snowdepth with increasing elevation. The results also suggest that mean temperature is the best single indicator of runoff variation. Meteorological observations over a range of elevations provide valuable information concerning the altitudinal gradient. The concluding chapter reviews some of the practical and technical implications of the work for hydrological investigations in the Upper Indus Basin. It suggests what can (and cannot) be learned from this type of study in relation to macroscale water resource assessment and forecasting...|$|R
