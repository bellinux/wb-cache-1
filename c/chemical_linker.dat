30|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>linkers</b> {{have been}} widely used to modify or {{crosslink}} biomolecules, such as proteins, peptides, nucleic acids and drugs, synthetic polymers and solid surfaces with functional molecules and materials. <b>Chemical</b> <b>linkers</b> can be characterized by the following properties: chemical specificity, reactive groups, spacer arm length, water solubility, cell membrane permeability, spontaneously reactive or photoreactive groups, and cleavability by such stimuli as pH, redox, and light. Particularly, spacer arm length and water solubility are important parameters for protein modifications and crosslinking using <b>chemical</b> <b>linkers.</b> For example, when biomolecules are functionalized with small molecules, such as fluorophores or bioorthogonal functional groups, rigid, short methylene arms are utilized as spacers. Various photocleavable, short <b>chemical</b> <b>linkers</b> were also developed to control the functions of crosslinked biomolecules [54, 262, 263]. In contrast, when proteins are functionalized with hydrophobic or large materials, hydrophilic, flexible, long spacer arms formed from PEG chains are often utilized to increase the water solubility of functionalized <b>chemical</b> <b>linkers</b> and to avoid steric hindrance between proteins and functionalized materials. We utilized PEG chains as <b>chemical</b> <b>linkers</b> to prepare a Fab’-green fluorescent protein (GFP) immunoconjugate for a homogeneous immunoassay [264], an enzyme-streptavidin conjugate for enzyme activity control [265, 266], and a Synechocystis sp.

30|$|Dopamine {{hydrochloride}} (DOPA) {{has recently}} been considered as a <b>chemical</b> <b>linker</b> that allows for efficient surface chemistry useful in not only inorganic materials (e.g., nanoparticles) but also biological materials (e.g., tissue) due to its excellent adhesive property and biocompatibility [16, 17]. In particular, DOPA has been reported as a <b>chemical</b> <b>linker</b> that is useful {{not only in the}} chemical modification of the surfaces of nanomaterials such as nanoparticles [18, 19], graphene oxide sheet [20], and carbon nanotubes [21], but also in improving binding affinities such as protein-peptide cross-linking [22], cellular adhesion to substrate [23], osteoconduction [24], and hemostatic adhesive in segmentectomy [25]. Despite the broad application of DOPA to surface chemistry using mutual interaction between DOPA and nanomaterials (e.g., nanoparticle), such an interaction has been poorly understood and not yet studied thoroughly. Since the surface modification of nanomaterials using DOPA typically employs a noncovalent conjugation (e.g., coordinate bonding, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, etc.) [6, 26], it is essential to establish an experimental framework that allows for measuring a weak binding affinity corresponding to such a noncovalent conjugation, which is useful in the development of drug carrier {{due to the fact that}} noncovalent conjugation enables the excretion of waster matter from the human body after the drug carrier completes the function of drug delivery or bioimaging [6, 7, 27, 28].|$|E

It emerges from a two-dimensional nematic liquid crystal placed on a sphere due to the presence of four 1 / 2 disclinations, i. e., topological defects in the orientational order [1]. In this paper we show that such a tetrahedral configuration also occurs in the wetting layers which form around spheres dispersed in a liquid crystal above the nematic-isotropic phase transition. Nematic wetting therefore offers an alternative route towards tetravalent colloids. Recently, D. Nelson proposed a method by which tetravalent colloids could be produced [1]. These micron-sized particles would have four <b>chemical</b> <b>linkers</b> or DNA strands symmetrically attached to their surfaces.

40|$|Carbon-based {{materials}} {{are poised to}} be an important class of 21 st century materials, for bio-medical, bio-electronic, and bio-sensing applications. Diamond and polymers are two examples of carbon-based materials of high interest to the bio-materials community. Diamond, in its conductive form, can be used as an electrochemical bio-sensor, whilst its nanoparticle form is considered a non-inflammatory platform to deliver drugs or to grow neuronal cells. Polymers, especially when chemically modified, have been used extensively in biological environments, from anti-microbial use to drug delivery. The large-scale use of either material for biological use is limited by two factors: ease of chemical modification and the paucity of knowledge of their surface chemistry in aqueous media. This thesis addresses aspects of both these issues. The first study reported is an in situ study of the adsorption dynamics of an exemplar globular protein (bovine serum albumin, BSA) on nanodiamond using the relatively novel quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) technique. For the first time, QCM-D enabled the detailed study of protein dynamics (i. e. kinetics, viscoelastic properties, overlayer structure, etc.) onto nanodiamond thin films having various surface chemistry and roughness. The dynamics of protein adsorption is found to be sensitive to surface chemistry at all stages of adsorption, but it is only sensitive to surface roughness during initial adsorption phases. Our understanding of the nanodiamond-biology interface is enhanced by this study, and it suggests that QCM-D is useful {{for the study of the}} surface chemistry of nanoparticle forms of inorganic materials. A second study concerns a novel surface functionalization scheme, based on carbene and azo-coupling chemistry, which has been recently introduced as a practical, facile method for modifying the surfaces of polymers. Using modern surface characterization techniques, it is demonstrated that a <b>chemical</b> <b>linker</b> can be attached to polystyrene surfaces using carbene-based chemistry, and that further chemical functionality can be added to this <b>chemical</b> <b>linker</b> via an azo-coupling reaction. In situ studies of protein dynamics at these interfaces were conducted using QCM-D, thus enabling a link between specific protein behaviour and the polymer surface chemical termination chemistry to be made. A third area of study of investigates the use of diamond electrodes as a bio-sensor for dopamine under physiological conditions. For these conditions, ascorbic acid interferes with the dopamine oxidation signal, in ways that render the two signals irresolvable. Various modifications are used in attempts to reduce this interference, including: small and large cathodic treatments, grafting of electro-active polymers, addition of carbon nanotubes, and hydrogen plasma treatment. Those modifications leading to the hydrogen-termination of diamond are shown to work the best. Notably, hydrogen plasma treatment effects the complete electrochemical separation of dopamine and ascorbic acid at a diamond electrode.

Normally, these are synthesized by modifying the nanoparticle surface with some <b>chemical</b> <b>linker</b> molecule, so that it can further interact with next incoming bio molecular entity with the help of free functional group of linker molecule. This procedure was already well established but supposed to be having some difficulty in the sense of stability of linker molecule due to various biochemical events. This might occur mostly under in vivo condition when applying the bioconjugate system in the targeted delivery of neoplastic compounds to tumor cell.|$|E

The thermoresponsive hydrogel was synthesized easily through coupling of poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly (-caprolactone) (PCL) with hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI) as a <b>chemical</b> <b>linker.</b> The chemical structure of the as-prepared triblock copolymer hydrogel was unraveled by FTIR and 1 H NMR analysis. The hydrogel showed a temperature-triggered sol-gel transition behavior and high potential for use as drug controlled release. When the surrounding temperature {{was close to the}} skin temperature of around 34 °C, it became a moisture management system where the liquids including sweat, blood, and other body fluids can be transported unidirectionally from one fabric side with the hydrophobic hydrogel coating to the untreated opposite side. This thereby showed that the thermoresponsive hydrogel-coated textile materials had a function to keep topical skin area clean, breathable, and comfortable, thus suggesting a great potential and significance for long-term skin treatment application. The structure and surface morphology of the thermoresponsive hydrogel, in vitro drug release behavior, and the mechanism of unidirectional water transport were investigated in detail. Our success in preparation of the functional textile composites will pave the way for development of various polymer- or textile-based functional materials that are applicable in the real world.

40|$|Abstract: OxyVita Hb {{is a new}} {{generation}} hemoglobin based oxygen carrier (HBOC) produced through modification of a zero-linked polymerization mechanism using activators which incorporate cross-linked bovine tetramer hemoglobin into “super-polymeric ” macromolecules (Average molecular weight = 17 MDa) {{for the purpose of}} oxygen delivery when whole blood or packed red cells are not available. This molecular design approach was generated in order to address several fundamental biochemical and physiological weaknesses of previous generations of HBOCs. Observation during pre-clinical and clinical studies provided evidence that these early generation acellular HBOCs were directly associated with loss of retention within the circulatory system, extravasation across endothelial tissue membranes due to their small molecular size leading to arterial and venous vasoconstriction with coupled increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP). The inherent increase in molecular size and structural stability of the OxyVita Hb is a direct response to addressing these serious weaknesses that have occurred during the evolution of HBOC development within the past two decades. The nature of the zero-linked synthetic route eliminates any <b>chemical</b> <b>linkers</b> remaining in the product, eliminating side reaction concerns, such as reversibility and decomposition due to weak chemical bonds, dependency on temperature and pressure, and residual toxicit...|$|R
40|$|Biological moulds, such as apoferritin, {{can be used}} to {{synthesize}} nanoparticles [1]. This biomimetic approach offers a number of advantages over other synthetic methods. Worth mentioning, among them, are the good homogeneity in the size and shapes of these moulds and the possibility of functionalizing the biological envelope with different chemical groups. Apoferritin robustness against relatively large variations in temperature and pH enables the synthesis of a variety of inorganic materials, from magnetic oxides such as γ-Fe 2 O 3 [1] and Gd complexes [2], to metals (Cu [3], Ni, Cr [4], etc) and even semiconductors as CdS [5] or CdSe [6]. For this reason, ferritin-based nanoparticles are seen as promising materials for a vast number of applications. The versatility of ferritin as a mould could also be advantageously employed to obtain multifunctional materials, by e. g. linking together ferritin molecules with different functionalities (e. g. a large magnetic moment in one monomer plus an optically active centre in the other). Although ferritin dimers and higher oligomers are present in solution [7], these molecular associations are mainly composed of reversible dimers with very weak interaction [8]. Here, as a first step, we report the synthesis and purification of dimers of natural ferritin molecules bound covalently by <b>chemical</b> <b>linkers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Antibody–drug conjugates (ADC), potent {{cytotoxic}} drugs {{linked to}} antibodies via <b>chemical</b> <b>linkers,</b> allow specific targeting of drugs to neoplastic cells. We {{have used this}} technology to develop the ADC DCDT 2980 S that targets CD 22, an antigen with expression limited to B cells {{and the vast majority}} of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). DCDT 2980 S consists of a humanized anti-CD 22 monoclonal IgG 1 antibody with a potent microtubule-disrupting agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), linked to the reduced cysteines of the antibody via a protease cleavable linker, maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzoyloxycarbonyl (MC-vc-PAB). We describe the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of DCDT 2980 S in animal models to assess its potential as a therapeutic for the treatment of B-cellmalignancies. Wedid not find a strong correlation between in vitro or in vivo efficacy andCD 22 surface expression, nor a correlation of sensitivity to free drug and in vitro potency. We show that DCDT 2980 S was capable of inducing complete tumor regression in xenograft mouse models of NHL and can be more effective than rituximab plus combination chemotherapy at drug exposures that were well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys. These results suggest that DCDT 2980 S has an efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics profile that support potential treatment of NHL. Mol Cancer Ther; 12 (7); 1 – 11. 2013 AACR...|$|R
