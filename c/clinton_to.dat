5|$|Even before Cornwallis's {{surrender}} in October, Benedict Arnold {{had requested}} permission from <b>Clinton</b> <b>to</b> go to England to give Lord George Germain {{his thoughts on}} the war in person. When word of the surrender reached New York, Arnold renewed the request, which Clinton then granted. On December 8, 1781, Arnold and his family left New York for England.|$|E
5|$|Five {{days after}} the battle ended, on October 24, 1781, the British fleet sent by <b>Clinton</b> <b>to</b> rescue the British army arrived. The fleet picked up several Loyalists who had escaped on October 18, and they {{informed}} Admiral Thomas Graves that they believed Cornwallis had surrendered. Graves picked up several more Loyalists along the coast, and they confirmed this fact. Graves sighted the French Fleet, but chose to leave because he was outnumbered by nine ships, and thus he sent the fleet back to New York.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 2004 Asian tsunami, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed <b>Clinton</b> <b>to</b> head a relief effort. After Hurricane Katrina, Clinton joined with fellow former president George H. W. Bush to establish the Bush-Clinton Tsunami Fund in January 2005, and the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund in October of that year. As part of the tsunami effort, these two ex-presidents appeared in a Super Bowl XXXIX pre-game show, and traveled to the affected areas. They also spoke together at the funeral of Boris Yeltsin in April 2007.|$|E

5|$|On {{the eve of}} the February 2016 New Hampshire Democratic primary, Ratajkowski {{spoke at}} a Bernie Sanders rally in New Hampshire to endorse his campaign.

5|$|The White House {{stated the}} firings were done because {{financial}} improprieties in the Travel Office operation during previous administrations had been revealed by an FBI investigation. Critics contended the firings were done to allow friends of President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham <b>Clinton</b> <b>to</b> {{take over the}} travel business and that {{the involvement of the}} FBI was unwarranted. Heavy media attention forced the White House to reinstate most of the employees in other jobs and remove the Clinton associates from the travel role.|$|E
5|$|De Grasse had {{notified}} {{his counterpart}} in Newport, the Comte de Barras Saint-Laurent, of his intentions and his planned arrival date. Barras sailed from Newport on 27 August with 8 ships of the line, 4 frigates, and 18 transports carrying French armaments and siege equipment. He deliberately sailed via a circuitous route {{in order to}} minimize the possibility of an encounter with the British, should they sail from New York in pursuit. Washington and Rochambeau, in the meantime, had crossed the Hudson on 24 August, leaving some troops behind as a ruse to delay any potential move on the part of General <b>Clinton</b> <b>to</b> mobilize assistance for Cornwallis.|$|E

5|$|In {{the run-up}} to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Warren's name was put forward by liberal Democrats as a {{possible}} presidential candidate. However, Warren repeatedly stated that she was not running for President in 2016. In October 2013, she joined with the other fifteen Senate Democratic women in signing a letter that encouraged Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>to</b> run. There was much speculation about Warren being added to the Democratic ticket as a vice-presidential candidate. On June 9, 2016, after the California Democratic primary, Warren formally endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. In response to questions when she endorsed Clinton, Warren said that she believed herself to be ready to be vice president, but she was not being vetted. On July 7, CNN reported that Warren was on a five-person shortlist to be Clinton's vice-presidential running mate. However, Clinton eventually chose Tim Kaine.|$|E
5|$|It was {{revealed}} in December 2005 that Bayh had raised $1.2 {{million in the}} first two quarters of 2005, more than any other potential candidate with the exception of Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee. But the cash did not translate into high marks among possible voters as a CNN poll conducted December 9–11 found that Bayh had the support of only 1% of self-identified Democrats, placing him seventh among possible candidates. Later in the month, Bayh was criticized by the video game industry for political posturing in his quest along with Senator Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>to</b> crack down on explicit content in video games. The manufacturers claimed that the movements were simply attempts to increase his appeal to values voters for his presidential run.|$|E
5|$|Sotomayor was {{nominated}} to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by President George H. W. Bush in 1991; confirmation followed in 1992. In 1997, she {{was nominated}} by President Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>to</b> the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Her nomination was slowed by the Republican {{majority in the}} United States Senate, but she was eventually confirmed in 1998. On the Second Circuit, Sotomayor heard appeals in more than 3,000 cases and wrote about 380 opinions. Sotomayor has taught at the New York University School of Law and Columbia Law School.|$|E

In 1991, Stein was hired to be the manager of the Bend Bucks of the Northwest League. The non-affiliated Bucks had a record of 30–46 with Stein as the manager. He was hired to be the manager of the Clinton Giants in 1992. Clinton was the Class-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants at the time. Stein led <b>Clinton</b> <b>to</b> a 59–79 record that year. After considering taking a year off of baseball in 1994, Stein eventually accepted the managerial position with the independent league Tyler WildCatters.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Convention, Hamilton {{was still}} not content with the final Constitution, but signed it anyway as a vast {{improvement}} over the Articles of Confederation, and urged his fellow delegates to do so also. Since the other two members of the New York delegation, Lansing and Yates, had already withdrawn, Hamilton was the only New York signer to the United States Constitution. He then took a highly active part in the successful campaign for the document's ratification in New York in 1788, which was a crucial step in its national ratification. He first used the popularity of the Constitution by the masses to compel George <b>Clinton</b> <b>to</b> sign, but was unsuccessful. The state convention in Poughkeepsie in June 1788 pitted Hamilton, Jay, James Duane, Robert Livingston, and Richard Morris against the Clintonian faction led by Melancton Smith, Lansing, Yates, and Gilbert Livingston.|$|E
5|$|In March, Congressman Darrell Issa, {{the ranking}} Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, {{sent a letter}} to White House Counsel Robert Bauer stating if Sestak's claim was true, the Obama {{administration}} may have violated a federal statue that makes it illegal for a government employee to use his authority to interfere with a Senate election. Interest in the alleged job offer reignited after Sestak defeated Specter in the primary on May 18. Seven Republicans from the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder seeking a review of the legal implications of the offer. Around this time, Sestak continued to maintain that a job offer was made, but he downplayed the importance of the incident and defended Obama's integrity. On May 28, the White House formally responded to the allegations and acknowledged White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel enlisted former President Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>to</b> offer Sestak a seat on a presidential advisory board or another executive board if Sestak dropped his candidacy. If Sestak accepted, he would have been allowed to remain in the House while serving in the unpaid position.|$|E

5|$|On the British side, General Clinton {{learned of}} the almost undefended Jamaica Pass from local Loyalists. He drew up a plan {{and gave it to}} William Erskine to propose to Howe. Clinton's plan had the main army making a night march and going through the Jamaica Pass to turn the American flank, while other troops would keep the Americans busy in front. On August 26, Clinton {{received}} word from Howe that the plan would be used, and that Clinton was to command the advance guard of the main army of 10,000 men on the march through the Jamaica Pass. While they made the night march, General James Grant's British troops along with some Hessians, a total of 4,000 men, were to attack the Americans in front to distract them from the main army coming on their flank. Howe told <b>Clinton</b> <b>to</b> be ready to move out that night, August 26.|$|E
5|$|The freeway turns east {{again and}} enters Union Township, {{coming to an}} {{interchange}} with CR 614 and Route 173. From here, I-78/US 22 continue east directly {{to the south of}} Route 173, coming to another interchange with that route as well as CR 625. Entering more commercial areas, Route 173 merges onto I-78/US 22 at exit 13. At exit 15, the highway meets an interchange with CR 513, and Route 173 splits from I-78/US 22 by heading north on CR 513. At this point, the freeway runs along the border of Franklin Township to the south and <b>Clinton</b> <b>to</b> the north before entirely entering Clinton and crossing the South Branch Raritan River. I-78/US 22 turns northeast and leaves Clinton for Clinton Township, where it has an eastbound exit and westbound entrance for Route 173 that also provides access to Route 31. Immediately after is the interchange with Route 31. At the next interchange near the community of Annandale, US 22 splits from I-78, heading closely to the south of that route.|$|E
5|$|The race {{began in}} November 1998 when four-term {{incumbent}} New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement. Both the Democratic Party and Republican Party sought high-profile candidates {{to compete for}} the open seat. By early 1999 Clinton and Mayor of New York City Rudolph Giuliani were the likely respective nominees. Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, purchased a house in Chappaqua, New York, in September 1999; she thereby became eligible for the election, although she faced characterizations of carpetbagging since she had never resided in the state before. The lead in statewide polls swung from <b>Clinton</b> <b>to</b> Giuliani and back to Clinton as the campaigns featured both successful strategies and mistakes as well as dealing with current events. In late April and May 2000, Giuliani's medical, romantic, marital, and political lives all collided in a tumultuous four-week period, culminating in his withdrawing from the race on May 19.|$|E

5|$|When New York's long-serving U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan {{announced}} his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged <b>Clinton</b> <b>to</b> run for Moynihan's open seat in the Senate election of 2000. Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999. She became the first First Lady of the United States to {{be a candidate for}} elected office. Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani (the mayor of New York City) as her Republican opponent in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public and Clinton instead faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing New York's 2nd congressional district. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, as she had never resided in New York nor participated in the state's politics before the 2000 Senate race.|$|E
