40|$|In {{response}} to recommendations from {{the review of}} the Victorian taxi industry, the objective of this project was to evaluate the appropriateness of current taxi and <b>hire</b> <b>car</b> age limits in ensuring safety of the taxi and <b>hire</b> <b>car</b> fleets. The aim was also to identify and analyse all associated issues including safety that the Taxi Services Commission (TSC) should consider in setting age limits for taxis and <b>hire</b> <b>cars</b> into the future. The project used a two phase methodology to meet these objectives. Phase one involved extensive consultation with relevant stakeholders in the taxi and <b>hire</b> <b>car</b> industries to determine issues relevant to the choice and operation of vehicles as taxis and <b>hire</b> <b>cars.</b> The second phase involved extensive analysis of the safety performance of the taxi and <b>hire</b> <b>car</b> fleet including the risk of crash involvement and injury outcomes related to vehicle choice {{in the event of a}} crash. The analysis then examined the relationship between these factors, taxi or <b>hire</b> <b>car</b> type and vehicle age.

Finally, the economic worth of each of the scenarios considered was estimated in order to identify the most cost-effective strategies for improving the future safety of the taxi and <b>hire</b> <b>car</b> fleet. Recommendations for future policy on taxi and <b>hire</b> <b>car</b> age limits, vehicle choice and driver focused interventions were made and priorities for further research identified...|$|R
