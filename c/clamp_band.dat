40|$|This paper {{presents}} two computational {{techniques for}} determining the structural capability of <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> systems, which are typically used in launch vehicle applications. Both techniques utilize three-dimensional finite element models (3 D FEM) and consider contact between all {{the components of the}} <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> system. One technique models the full circumference of the <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> structure, while the other technique models a circumferential slice of the <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> system and uses cyclic symmetry. The analytical predictions for the full 3 D model show reasonable agreement with test data. The cyclic symmetry model underestimates the capability of the hardware to withstand applied loads. Numerical studies were also performed to investigate how physical parameters, such as friction and band pre-tension, affect the structural capability of the <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> system. I. Description of a <b>Clamp</b> <b>Band</b> System A <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> is a type of joint that does not require the use of mechanical fasteners or adhesives on either of the components that are being mated, Figure 1. <b>Clamp</b> <b>band</b> systems are used extensively on systems that require remote separation of the components, and clamp bands are suitable since they are typically released via pyrotechnic devices. This characteristic makes <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> systems an obvious choice for spacecraft deployment and they are used for...|$|E
50|$|The Type II is {{sometimes}} referred to as the Model 1864, but is more commonly referred to as just a variant of the Model 1863. This version re-introduced band springs, replaced the <b>clamping</b> <b>bands</b> with solid oval bands, and replaced the three leaf rear sight with single leaf sight. A total of 255,040 of these were manufactured from 1864 to 1865.|$|R
25|$|Attachment rings allow {{separate}} neck seals, gloves, and (less commonly) {{boots to}} be joined to the suit with a watertight seal. The older style attachment ring system uses a support ring inside the suit and a <b>clamping</b> <b>band</b> outside the suit to tightly hold the suit and the separate hood/boot/glove together. They were also used with the neck seals of some old British frogman-type dry suits.|$|R

The Type I eliminated the band springs and replaced the flat barrel <b>bands</b> with oval <b>clamping</b> <b>bands.</b> It also featured a new ramrod, a case-hardened lock, a new hammer, and a redesigned bolster (percussion chamber). Several of these modifications were based upon Colt's contract model 1861, known as the [...] "Colt special". 273,265 Type I variants were manufactured in 1863.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> {{system is}} a typical locked and {{separated}} device of the launch vehicle (LV) / the spacecraft (SC), and its release-separation process {{is one of the}} important factors that affect the LV/SC separation movement. A nonlinear spring-damper model was employed to describe the contact-impact behavior between the V-segment of the <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> and the LV/SC interface, and lumped mass method was used to depict the <b>clamp</b> <b>band.</b> By using ADAMS, a dynamic model of the <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> system was established. The simulation results show that the impulse of the explosive bolts and the stiffness of lateral-restraining springs have significant effects on the <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> dynamic envelope. The shock of the satellite-vehicle separation is very vulnerable to the <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> pretension and the friction coefficient between the V-segment and the LV/SC interface...|$|E
40|$|In small spacecraft, the {{proximity}} of sensitive components to release systems {{has led to the}} need for lowshock spacecraft release systems. Marmon band systems are often desirable for their flight history, structural capability, and reliability. Until recently, only pyrotechnically released clamp bands were readily available. The <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> system described in ths paper reduces shock in two ways: it eliminates shock typically associated with pyrotechnic release devices as well as utilizing a release device that reduces the shock associated with the rapid release of the preload strain energy. Patented Fast Acting Shockless Separation Nut (FASSN) technology is utilized to convert strain energy stored in the system into rotational energy of a flywheel. Early FASSN devices were designed for discrete point applications and were somewhat large and massive. Additional development of the FASSN device has reduced the size and weight to enable the use of the technology in a medium sized (12 to 24 inch diameter) <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> system. This paper describes the overall design, performance, and initial test results for the FASSN-based, non-pyrotechnic, low-shock <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> release system...|$|E

40|$|TechDemoSat- 1 is a UK-funded {{technology}} demonstration satellite, carrying 8 payloads {{provided by}} UK organisations, which {{is due to}} be launched {{in the first quarter of}} 2014. Cranfield University has supplied a De-Orbit Sail (DOS) payload to allow the mission to comply with end-of-life debris mitigation guidelines. The payload provides a passive, simple, and low-cost means of mitigating debris proliferation in Low Earth Orbit, by enhancing spacecraft aerodynamic drag at end-of-life and reducing time to natural orbital decay and re-entry. This paper describes the use of small commercial electro-explosive devices (EEDs), produced for use as parachute tether-cutters in reserve chute deployment systems, as low-cost but high-reliability release mechanisms for space applications.

40|$|The {{particular}} study case in {{this thesis}} is the shock test performed on the LISA Pathfinder satellite conducted in a laboratory environment on a dedicated test bed: Vega Shock Test Apparatus (VESTA). This test is considered fully representative to study shock levels produced by fairing jettisoning event at Vega Launcher Vehicle, which induces high shock loads towards the satellite. In the frame of this thesis, some transient response analyses have been conducted in MSC Nastran, and a shock simulation tool for the VESTA test configuration has been developed. The simulation tool is based on Nastran Direct Transient Response Analysis solver (SOL 109), and {{is representative of the}} upper composite of Vega with the LISA Pathfinder coupled to it. Post-processing routines of transient response signals were conducted in Dynaworks which served to calculate Shock Response Spectra (SRS). The simulation tool is a model of forcing function parameters for transient analysis which adequately correlates with the shock real test data, in order to understand how the effect of shock generated by the launcher is seen in the satellite and its sub-systems. Since available computation resources are limited the parameters for analysis were optimised for computation time, file size, memory capacity,  and model complexity. The forcing function represents a release of the HSS <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> which is responsible for fairing jettisoning, thus the parameters which were studied are mostly concerning the modelling of this event. Among many investigated, those which visibly improved SRS correlation are radial forcing function shape, implementation of axial impulse, <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> loading geometry and refined loading scheme. Integration time step duration and analysis duration were also studied and found to improve correlation.   From each analysis, the qualifying shock environment was then derived by linear scaling in proportion of the applied preload, and considering a qualification margin of 3 dB. Consecutive tracking of structural responses along shock propagation path exposed gradual changes in responses pattern and revealed an important property that a breathing mode (n = 0) {{at the base of a}} conical Adapter translates into an axial input to the spacecraft. The parametrisation itself was based on responses registered at interfaces located in near-field (where the <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> is located and forcing function is applied) and medium-field with respect to the shock event location. Following shock propagation path, the final step was the analysis of shock responses inside the satellite located in a far-field region, which still revealed a very good correlation of results. Thus, it can be said that parametrisation process was adequate, and the developed shock simulation tool can be qualified. However, due to the nature of shock, the tool cannot fully replace VESTA laboratory test, but can support shock assessment process and preparation to such test. In the last part of the thesis, the implementation of some finite element model improvements is investigated. Majority of the panels in spacecraft interior exhibited shock over-prediction due to finite element model limitation. Equipment units modelled as lump masses rigidly attached with RBE 2 elements to the panel surface are a source of such local over-predictions. Thus, some of the units were remodelled and transient responses were reinvestigated. It was found that remodelling with either solid elements, or lump mass connected to RBE 3 element and reinforced by RBE 2 element, can significantly improve local transient responses. This conclusion is in line with conclusions found in ECSS Shock Handbook...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the stresses in V-section <b>band</b> <b>clamps</b> by examining the correlation between experimental work and theoretical models. Theoretical models incorporating traditional beam-bending theories and allowing for friction were developed to calculate the stress distribution and displacements within the clamps. The theoretical models demonstrated that the normal manufacturing tolerances associated with this type of component, combined with the uncontrolled operating parameters, will produce a wide variation in working stresses. These theoretical models were validated using strain and displacement measurements from a test with a V-section <b>band</b> <b>clamp</b> positioned around rigid anges. The experimental results all fell within the range of stresses predicted by the theoretical models. The paper provides a knowledge base for the rational design of V-section <b>band</b> <b>clamps...</b>|$|R

2500|$|A band mask is a {{heavy duty}} {{full-face}} mask {{with many of the}} characteristics of a lightweight demand helmet. In structure it is the front section of a lightweight helmet from above the faceplate to below the demand valve and exhaust ports, including the bailout block and communications connections on the sides. This rigid frame is attached to a neoprene hood by a metal <b>clamping</b> <b>band,</b> hence the name. It is provided with a padded sealing surface around the frame edge which is held firmly against the diver's face by a rubber [...] "spider", a multiple strap arrangement with a pad behind the diver's head, and usually five straps which hook onto pins on the band. The straps have several holes so the tension can be adjusted to get a comfortable seal. A band mask is heavier than other full face masks, but lighter than a helmet, and can be donned more quickly than a helmet. They are often used by the standby diver for this reason.|$|R

40|$|Previous work on {{the elastic}} {{deformation}} of flat-section <b>band</b> <b>clamps</b> has been extended to account for plastic deformation of the band material. Both finite element analysis using a multilinear plastic model and a classical approach using a continuous plastic equation are reported. The excellent agreement between {{the results of these}} two approaches provides a high level of confidence in the models. The finite element approach was found to be extremely time consuming owing to the combination of changing contact non-linearity and material non-linearity. The classical approach provided a much faster solution method when used with the iteration schemes proposed here. The classical method of analysis was used to determine the response to a range of conditions.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{torsional}} load capacity of three sizes of V-section <b>band</b> <b>clamps</b> when assembled onto rigid flanges by comparing experimental data with a developed theoretical model. This {{mode of failure}} {{is of particular interest}} for turbocharger applications where, in use, they are subjected to torsional loading via thermal and vibrational effects. The theoretical model developed allows the impact on torsional load capacity of a number of joint parameters to be investigated and good correlation of the results, incorporating variations in coefficients of friction and dimensions, has been shown for the two larger band sizes. For smaller diameter bands, the experimental data suggests that as the band is tightened, contact with the flange is localised rather than being over the full circumference of the band. The coefficients of friction, in particular that between the flanges, and the position of the contact point between band and flange have been shown to {{have a significant impact on}} the theoretical torsional load capacity of V-section <b>band</b> <b>clamps...</b>|$|R

The shell halves were made of sheets of Ecuadorean balsawood sandwiched between sheets of Canadian birch, but in areas needing extra strength— such as along cut-outs— stronger woods replaced the balsa filler; the overall thickness of the birch and balsa sandwich skin was only 7/16 in. This sandwich skin was so stiff that no internal reinforcement was necessary from the wing's rear spar to the tail bearing bulkhead.
