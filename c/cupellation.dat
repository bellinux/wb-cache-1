5|$|Central Europe {{became the}} centre of silver {{production}} during the Middle Ages, as the Mediterranean deposits exploited by the ancient civilisations had been exhausted. Silver mines were opened in Bohemia, Saxony, Erzgebirge, Alsace, the Lahn region, Siegerland, Silesia, Hungary, Norway, Steiermark, Salzburg, and the southern Black Forest. Most of these ores were quite rich in silver and could simply be separated by hand from the remaining rock and then smelted; some deposits of native silver were also encountered. Many of these mines were soon exhausted, {{but a few of}} them remained active until the Industrial Revolution, before which the world production of silver was around a meagre 50tonnes per year. In the Americas, high temperature silver-lead <b>cupellation</b> technology was developed by pre-Inca civilizations as early as AD 60–120; silver deposits in India, China, Japan, and pre-Columbian America continued to be mined during this time.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{is usually}} {{found in nature}} {{combined}} with other metals, or in minerals that contain silver compounds, generally {{in the form of}} sulfides such as galena (lead sulfide) or cerussite (lead carbonate). So the primary production of silver requires the smelting and then <b>cupellation</b> of argentiferous lead ores, a historically important process. Lead melts at 327°C, lead oxide at 888°C and silver melts at 960°C. To separate the silver, the alloy is melted again at the high temperature of 960°C to 1000°C in an oxidizing environment. The lead oxidises to lead monoxide, then known as litharge, which captures the oxygen from the other metals present. The liquid lead oxide is removed or absorbed by capillary action into the hearth linings.|$|E
25|$|In recent work, {{the authors}} have {{proposed}} {{that there is a}} gendering of the space, with ritual activities, <b>cupellation,</b> weaving, cooking and domestic administration being in female hands in rooms 1 and 2 while room 4 {{on the opposite side of}} the street was associated with male activities as indicated by the martial and agricultural tools found inside.|$|E
25|$|Lead may be {{introduced}} into glass either as an ingredient {{of the primary}} melt or added to preformed leadless glass or frit. The lead oxide used in lead glass could be obtained {{from a variety of}} sources. In Europe, galena, lead sulfide, was widely available, which could be smelted to produce metallic lead. The lead metal would be calcined to form lead oxide by roasting it and scraping off the litharge. In the medieval period lead metal could be obtained through recycling from abandoned Roman sites and plumbing, even from church roofs. Metallic lead was demanded in quantity for silver <b>cupellation,</b> and the resulting litharge could be used directly by glassmakers. Lead was also used for ceramic lead glazes. This material interdependence suggests a close working relationship between potters, glassmakers, and metalworkers.|$|E
500|$|The {{situation}} {{changed with}} the discovery of <b>cupellation,</b> a technique that allowed silver metal to be extracted from its ores. While slag heaps found in Asia Minor and on the islands of the Aegean Sea indicate that silver was being separated from lead as early as the 4th millennium BC, and one of the earliest silver extraction centres in Europe was Sardinia in early the Chalcolithic period, these techniques did not spread widely until later, ...|$|E
500|$|Silver {{production}} has also inspired figurative language. Clear references to <b>cupellation</b> occur throughout the Old Testament of the Bible, {{such as in}} Jeremiah's rebuke to Judah: [...] "The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away. Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the Lord hath rejected them." [...] (Jeremiah 6:19–20) Jeremiah was also aware of sheet silver, exemplifying the malleability and ductility of the metal: [...] "Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, {{the work of the}} workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men." [...] (Jeremiah 10:9) ...|$|E
500|$|Peale {{journeyed to}} London, hoping that Moore's {{connections}} {{could get him}} instruction in the parting process. [...] Although he visited the Royal Mint, he found officials there unhelpful and unwilling to teach him. In England, Peale studied the method of assaying via the humid process at Percival N. Johnson's refinery, and in 1835 introduced it to the Philadelphia Mint, replacing assaying by <b>cupellation.</b> Peale wrote that he [...] "cannot speak in too high terms of Mr. Percival Johnson... I have derived much useful information in his refinery particularly his method of separating silver, gold and paladium [...] by a shortened process". While in London, Peale ordered a delicate balance scale from his friend, expatriate American Joseph Saxton, and later induced Saxton {{to return to the}} United States and work for the Philadelphia Mint.|$|E
2500|$|The very {{earliest}} {{precious metals}} had mixes {{of gold and}} silver; gold and silver alloy is called electrum. With the advent of coinage, methods had to be invented to remove impurities from the gold so that gold of specific purities could be made. <b>Cupellation</b> was able to remove gold and silver from mixtures containing lead and other metals, but silver could not be removed. Gold parting as a process was specifically invented to remove the silver. The main ancient process of gold parting was by salt cementation and there is archaeological evidence of that process from the 6th century BC in Sardis, Lydia. [...] In the post-medieval period parting using antimony, sulfates and mineral acids was also used. In the modern period chlorination using the Miller process, and electrolysis using the Wohlwill process are {{the most widely used}} methods of refining gold by removing silver and platinum.|$|E
2500|$|Silver was not {{a common}} {{material}} in Celtic art, and certainly not on this scale. Except sometimes for small pieces of jewellery, gold or bronze were more usual for prestige metalwork. At {{the time that the}} Gundestrup cauldron was created, silver was obtained through <b>cupellation</b> of lead/silver ores. By comparing the concentration of lead isotopes with the silverwork of other cultures, {{it has been suggested that}} the silver came from multiple ore deposits, mostly from Celtic northern France and western Germany in the pre-Roman period. The lead isotope studies also indicate that the silver for manufacturing the plates was prepared by repeatedly melting ingots and/or scrap silver. Three to six distinct batches of recycled silver may have been used in making the vessel. Specifically, the circular [...] "base plate" [...] may have originated as a phalera, and it is commonly thought to have been positioned in the bottom of the bowl as a late addition, soldered in to repair a hole. By an alternative theory, this phalera was not initially part of the bowl, but instead formed part of the decorations of a wooden cover.|$|E
6000|$|We at once {{recognized}} {{the value of}} this discovery when, reaching the tents, we examined the quartz, and found it seamed and pitted with veins and geodes containing Colorado, earthy and crumbling metallic dust, chlorure, iodure, and bromure of silver, with various colours, red, ochre-yellow, and dark chocolate-brown. It stained the fingers, and was suspiciously light--n'importe. I must regret that here, as indeed throughout the exploration, all our specimens were taken from the surface: we had not time to dig even a couple of feet deep. The lad 'Id almost fainted with joy and surprise when the silver dollars were dropped into his hand, one by one, with the reiteration of [...] "Here's another for you! and here's another!" [...] This lavishness served to stimulate cupidity, and every day the Bedawin brought in specimens from half a dozen different places. But the satisfaction was at its height when the crucible produced, after <b>cupellation,</b> a button of [...] "silver" [...] weighing some twenty grammes from the hundred grammes of what the grumbling Californian miners had called, in their wrath, [...] "dashed black dust;"[EN#109] and when a second experiment yielded twenty-eight grammes (each fifteen grains and a half) and ten centigrammes from 111 grammes, or {{about a quarter of a}} pound avoirdupois. In the latter experiment also, the culot came away without the litharge, which almost always contains traces of silver and antimony. Hence we concluded that the proportions were 30:110--a magnificent result, considering that 12-1/2:100 is held to be rich ore in the silver mines of the Pacific States.[EN#110] The engineer was radieux with pride and joy. The yellow tint of the [...] "buttons" [...] promised gold--two per cent.? Three per cent.? Immense wealth lay before us: a ton of silver is worth 250,000 francs. Meanwhile--and now I take blame to myself--no one thought of testing the find, even by a blow with the hammer.|$|E

50|$|The South African company Rand Refinery Limited rebuilt its smelter in 1986, {{incorporating}} two 1.5 t TBRCs {{and a small}} static {{reverberatory furnace}} for <b>cupellation</b> to produce doré bullion containing gold and silver.

Consequently, the reverberatory <b>cupellation</b> furnace was necessary to complete the process.|$|E
50|$|The BRM lead {{refinery}} at Northfleet in England {{uses the}} Parkes process followed by liquation and a vacuum induction retort to recover precious metals.

Prior {{to the development of the}} BBOC, BRM used <b>cupellation</b> in a 15 tonne (“t”) reverberatory <b>cupellation</b> furnace to recover the precious metals from this mixture.

50|$|The most elaborate, but totally destructive, {{assay method}} is the fire assay, or <b>cupellation.</b> As applied to gold bearing metallics, as in {{hallmark}} assaying, {{it is also}} known as <b>cupellation</b> and can have an accuracy of 1 part in 10,000. In this process the article is melted, the alloys separated and constituents weighed. Since this method is totally destructive, when this method is employed for the assay of jewelry, it is done under the guise of random or selective sampling.

50|$|One ancient {{process for}} extracting the silver from lead was <b>cupellation.</b> Lead was melted in a bone ash 'test' or 'cupel' and air blown across the surface. This {{oxidised}} {{the lead to}} litharge, troy ounces of silver per ton of lead (178 ppm).|$|E
50|$|The most elaborately accurate, but totally destructive, {{precious}} metal assay is fire-assay. (It {{may also be}} called by the critical <b>cupellation</b> step that separates {{precious metal}} from lead.) If performed on bullion (high purity precious metal alloy) to international standards, the method can be accurate on gold metal to 1 part in 10,000. If performed on ore materials using fusion followed by <b>cupellation</b> separation, detection may be in parts per billion. However, accuracy on ore material is typically limited to 3 to 5% of reported value. Although time consuming, the method is the accepted standard applied for valuing gold ore as well as gold and silver bullion at major refineries and gold mining companies.In the case of fire assaying of gold and platinum ores, the lengthy time required to carry out an assay generally is offset by carrying out large numbers of assays simultaneously, and a typical laboratory will be equipped with several fusion and <b>cupellation</b> furnaces, each capable of taking multiple samples, so that several hundred analyses per day can be carried out. The principal advantage of fire assay is that large samples can be used, and these increase the accuracy in analysing low yield ores in the <1g/T range of concentration.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cupellation</b> process {{finishes}} {{when the}} silver is about 99.7% pure. At this point, the silver is poured from the furnace {{and transferred to}} another furnace, where a flux is added to upgrade and remove the oxygen from the silver to produce market bullion of 99.9% purity.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the main}} purpose of small scale <b>cupellation</b> was to assay and test {{minerals}} and metals, the matter to be tested has to be carefully weighed. The assays were made in the <b>cupellation</b> or assay furnace, which needs to have windows and bellows to ascertain that the air oxidises the lead, as well as to be sure and prepared to take away the cupel when the process is over. Pure lead has {{to be added to the}} matter being tested to guarantee the further separation of the impurities. After the litharge has been absorbed by the cupel, buttons of silver were formed and settled in the middle of the cupel. [...] If the alloy also contained a certain amount of gold, it settled with the silver and both had to be separated by parting.|$|E
