500|$|Gilligan {{reasoned}} that, because Mulder and Scully {{would appear}} on a nationally syndicated television series, the episode's main monster could not be shown, only [...] "hinted at". Gilligan and the writing staff applied methods previously used in the 1999 psychological horror film The Blair Witch Project to show as little of the monster as possible while still making the episode scary. Michael Watkins, who directed the episode, had a good rapport with the Los Angeles police department. As such, he secured real Sheriff's deputies as extras. Casting director Rick Milikan later explained that the group needed [...] "actors who could pull off the believability in just normal off-the-cuff conversation of <b>cops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> job." [...] During the crack house scene, real SWAT team members were hired {{to break down the}} doors. Actor Judson Mills later explained that, because there were few cameramen and owing to {{the manner in which the}} episode was filmed, [...] "people just behaved as if we were [...] cops. I had other cops waving and giving their signals or heads-up the way they do amongst themselves. It was quite funny".|$|E

In his campaign he said [...] "mistakes were made" [...] and called being mayor of New York City [...] "the second toughest job in America." [...] Two television advertisements described his position: In one he looked directly into the camera and said, [...] "I guessed wrong on the weather before the city's biggest snowfall last winter. And that was a mistake. But I put 6,000 more <b>cops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> streets. And that was no mistake. The school strike went on too long and we all made some mistakes. But I brought 225,000 more jobs to this town. And that was no mistake... And we did not have a Detroit, a Watts or Newark. And those were no mistakes. The things that go wrong are what make this the second toughest job in America. But the things that go right are those things that make me want it." [...] The second opened with a drive through the Holland Tunnel from lower Manhattan toward New Jersey and suggested that, [...] "Every New Yorker should take this trip at least once before election day..." [...] followed by video of Newark, New Jersey which had been devastated by race riots.|$|E
