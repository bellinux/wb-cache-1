Rwanda Specialty Coffee Roasters buys from Maraba and sells to the domestic market. Maraba <b>coffee</b> <b>is</b> also brewed into a beer.|$|E
5|$|Maraba <b>coffee</b> <b>is</b> {{grown in}} the south of Rwanda at {{coordinates}} , roughly 12kilometres (7mi) from Butare and 150kilometres (93mi) from the capital, Kigali. The project began in the Maraba District of Butare Province, but these entities were replaced under local government organisation in 2006, and the area is now part of Huye District in the Southern Province. The area is very hilly, due to its proximity to the Western Rift Valley and the montane Nyungwe Forest, and features rich volcanic soils. The <b>coffee</b> <b>is</b> grown at altitudes between 1,700 and 2,100 metres (5,577–6,889ft) above sea level, often on steep hillsides with terrace farming. The area experiences an average of 115centimetres (45in) of rainfall annually. The majority of this falls during the rainy season of March to May, the major coffee harvesting season. The high altitude lowers the temperature slightly to an average of about 20 °C (68 °F). There is little seasonal variation.|$|E
5|$|The area is {{also home}} to many desserts, ranging from those made {{regularly}} and those that are commonly reserved for the holidays. Most Palestinian sweets are pastries filled with either sweetened cheeses, dates or various nuts such as almonds, walnuts or pistachios. Beverages could also depend on holidays such as during Ramadan, where carob, tamarind and apricot juices are consumed at sunset. <b>Coffee</b> <b>is</b> consumed throughout the day and liquor is not very prevalent among the population, however, some alcoholic beverages such as arak or beer are consumed by Christians and less conservative Muslims.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coffee</b> <b>was</b> first {{introduced}} by the Dutch during colonization in late 17th century. After several years <b>coffee</b> <b>was</b> planted on Indonesia Archipelago. Many <b>coffee</b> specialties <b>are</b> from the Indonesian Archipelago. The colloquial name for coffee, Java, comes from the time when most of Europe and America's <b>coffee</b> <b>was</b> grown in Java. Today Indonesia {{is one of the}} largest coffee producers in the world, mainly for export.|$|R

50|$|Yauco's main crops <b>are</b> <b>coffee,</b> plantains, {{oranges and}} tobacco. Yauco <b>coffees</b> <b>are</b> a revived {{specialty}} origin that, at best, display {{the qualities that}} made Jamaica Blue Mountain famous: A deep, vibrant, yet restrained acidity and balanced, gently rich flavor. However, this potentially finest of Caribbean <b>coffees</b> <b>is</b> often marred by inconsistency.|$|R
5|$|There is {{a strong}} coffee-drinking culture in Israel. <b>Coffee</b> <b>is</b> {{prepared}} as instant (nes), iced, latte (hafuḥ), Italian-style espresso, or Turkish coffee, which is sometimes flavored with cardamom (hel). Jewish writers, artists, and musicians from Germany and Austria who immigrated to Israel before the Second World War introduced {{the model of the}} Viennese coffee house with its traditional décor, relaxed atmosphere, coffee and pastries.|$|E
5|$|Two hot {{beverages}} that Palestinians consume is coffee—served in {{the morning}} and throughout the day—and tea which is often sipped in the evening. Tea is usually flavored with na'ana (mint) or maramiyyeh (sage). The coffee of choice is usually Turkish or Arabic coffee. Arabic <b>coffee</b> <b>is</b> similar to Turkish coffee, but the former is spiced with cardamom and is usually unsweetened.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon's natural {{resources}} {{are very well}} suited to agriculture and arboriculture. An estimated 70% of the population farms, and agriculture comprised an estimated 19.8% of GDP in 2009. Most agriculture is done at the subsistence scale by local farmers using simple tools. They sell their surplus produce, and some maintain separate fields for commercial use. Urban centres are particularly reliant on peasant agriculture for their foodstuffs. Soils and climate on the coast encourage extensive commercial cultivation of bananas, cocoa, oil palms, rubber, and tea. Inland on the South Cameroon Plateau, cash crops include coffee, sugar, and tobacco. <b>Coffee</b> <b>is</b> a major cash crop in the western highlands, and in the north, natural conditions favour crops such as cotton, groundnuts, and rice. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Cameroon vulnerable to shifts in their prices.|$|E

5|$|Produced by Sara Lee's Douwe Egberts brand, BK Joe was Burger King's coffee {{line that}} was first {{introduced}} in 2001 in North America and later in parts of Europe. Advertised as being made from Arabica coffee, the product was made using Douwe's Cafitesse system, a platform that eschews coffee brewed from ground beans {{in favor of a}} beverage made from a coffee concentrate with hot water added. Sara Lee claims the advantage of the system is that each cup of <b>coffee</b> <b>is</b> made at the time of order with minimal waste and labor. The product was not designed to compete with products from companies such as Starbucks, but was intended to appeal to customers who seek a consistent cup of coffee.|$|E
5|$|The coffee {{farmers of}} Maraba first needed a washing station to remove sugar from the coating {{of the coffee}} bean, under the skin. If this sugar is not removed within 12 hours of picking, the flavour of the <b>coffee</b> <b>is</b> impaired. They built the first station in July 2001 in the Cyarumbo sector, close to the main road, with funding from UNR, the Office des Cultures Industrielles du Rwanda (OCIR-Café), ACDI/VOCA, and the Institut des Sciences Agronomiques du Rwanda (ISAR). The opening {{was late in the}} harvest season, so only 200kilograms (441lb) of that year's harvest were {{suitable}} for washing. However, the results were reasonably good, and the station was upgraded to allow more coffee to be processed in 2002. To bring mineral water from Mount Huye to the upgraded station, ACDI/VOCA helped fund a pipeline, which opened in March 2002.|$|E
25|$|The best (but least used) {{method of}} drying <b>coffee</b> <b>is</b> using drying tables. In this method, the pulped and {{fermented}} <b>coffee</b> <b>is</b> spread thinly on raised beds, which allows the air to pass {{on all sides of}} the coffee, and then the <b>coffee</b> <b>is</b> mixed by hand. In this method the drying that takes place is more uniform, and fermentation is less likely. Most African <b>coffee</b> <b>is</b> dried in this manner and certain coffee farms around the world are starting to use this traditional method.|$|E

5000|$|However, the {{predicate}} of {{a universal}} affirmative claim won't really fit any of these models.

25|$|<b>Coffee</b> <b>is</b> {{the most}} {{well-established}} fair trade commodity. Most Fair Trade <b>coffee</b> <b>is</b> Coffea arabica, {{a type of}} coffee known to be grown at high altitudes. A lot of emphasis is put {{on the quality of}} the coffee when dealing in Fair Trade markets because Fair Trade markets are usually specialized markets that appeal to customers who are motivated by taste rather than price. The Fair Trade movement fixated on coffee first because it is a highly traded commodity for most producing countries and almost half the world's <b>coffee</b> <b>is</b> produced by smallholder farmers.
