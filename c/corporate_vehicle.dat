40|$|The {{last few}} years have seen an {{international}} campaign {{to ensure that the}} world's financial and banking systems are "transparent," meaning that every actor and transaction within the system can be traced to a discrete, identifiable individual. I present an audit study of compliance with the prohibitions on anonymous shell companies. In particular, I describe my attempts to found anonymous <b>corporate</b> <b>vehicles</b> without proof of identity and then to establish corporate bank accounts for these vehicles. (Transactions processed through the corporate account of such a "shell company" become effectively untraceable—and thus very useful for those looking to hide criminal profits, pay or receive bribes, finance terrorists, or escape tax obligations.) I solicited offers of anonymous <b>corporate</b> <b>vehicles</b> from 54 different corporate service providers in 22 different countries, and collated the responses to determine whether the existing legal and regulatory prohibitions on anonymous <b>corporate</b> <b>vehicles</b> actually work in practice. To foreshadow the results, it seems that small island offshore centers may have standards for corporate transparency and disclosure that are higher than major OECD economies like the United States and the United Kingdom. ...|$|R

40|$|Billions in corrupt assets, complex money trails, {{strings of}} shell {{companies}} and other spurious legal structures. These form the complex web of subterfuge in corruption cases, behind which hides the benefi cial owner-the puppet master and benefi ciary of it all. Linking the benefi cial owner to {{the proceeds of}} corruption is notoriously hard. With sizable wealth and resources on their side, they exploit transnational constructions {{that are hard to}} penetrate and stay aggressively ahead of the game. Nearly all cases of grand corruption have one thing in common. They rely on <b>corporate</b> <b>vehicles</b> - legal structures such as companies, foundations, and trusts-to conceal ownership and control of tainted assets. The Puppet Masters: How the Corrupt Use Legal Structures to Hide Stolen Assets and What to Do About It takes these <b>corporate</b> <b>vehicles</b> as its angle of investigation. It builds upon cases, interviews with investigators, corporate registries and fi nancial institutions, as well as a "mystery shopping" exercise that provide factual evidence of a criminal practice.

It is intended for use by policy makers in developing national legislation and regulation as well as international standard setters.

50|$|When assets do {{go through}} the {{financial}} system, tracing from one account to the next will usually leave an audit trail that can be exploited by financial investigators. As stolen assets are often layered through several different accounts and <b>corporate</b> <b>vehicles,</b> investigators will often benefit from outside information such as seized financial documents and suspicious transaction reports filed with banking regulators and other law enforcement agencies. Given the speed that monies can be transferred in the global financial system, identifying and tracing the bank accounts of the perpetrators {{is not an easy}} task, even for a seasoned investigator. A high degree of expertise, resources and cooperation between multiple intelligence and law enforcement agencies is essential for successful tracing.|$|R

50|$|The {{process to}} commercially exploit {{research}} varies widely.

Often these approaches are associated with raising of venture capital (VC) as a means of funding the development process, a practice more common in the United States than in the European Union, which has a more conservative approach to VC funding. Research spin-off companies are a popular vehicle of commercialisation in Canada, where the rate of licensing of Canadian university research remains far below that of the US.|$|R
