40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{interaction}} between science and technology of Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR) from both scientific literatures and <b>patent</b> <b>documents.</b> The sample data included 1603 nonpatent references (NPRs) from 1030 patents and 160 <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> <b>cited</b> by 3287 scientific literatures. The result shows that the scientific literature amounts to 10 percent of all references cited by technical documents. On the other hand, only 4 percent of the scientific literature had <b>cited</b> the <b>patent</b> <b>documents.</b> The time lags between patent application and paper publication from the NPRs are mostly within 4 years. However, some patents which have been issued 10 years ago were still cited by scientific literatures.

40|$|Scientific {{references}} in <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> {{can be used}} as indicators signaling science-technology interactions. Whether they reflect a direct ‘knowledge flow’ from science to technology is subject of debate. Based on 33 interviews with inventors at Belgian firms and knowledge-generating institutes active in nanotechnology, biotechnology and life sciences, we analyze the extent to which scientific {{references in}} patents reflect sources of inspiration. Our results indicate that scientific knowledge acts as a source of inspiration for about 50 % of the inventions. At the same time, the scientific references <b>cited</b> in <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> and available in patent databases do not provide an accurate picture in this respect: 30 % of patents that were inspired by scientific knowledge do not contain any scientific references. Moreover, if scientific references are present, half of them are evaluated as unimportant or background information by the inventor. Overall, these observations provide evidence that scientific references in <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> signal relatedness with the implied inventions without necessarily implying a direct, inspirational, knowledge flow between both activity realms. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|Fortunately, the European Patent Office (EPO) {{operates}} a database and patent search engine entitled Espacenet, which contains over 70 million <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> from 1836 to the present. Each <b>patent</b> <b>document</b> on Espacenet contains information on “citing documents”, which include any <b>citing</b> <b>patents.</b> The <b>citing</b> <b>patents</b> contain {{information on the}} country of residence of the associated inventor. If a US <b>patent</b> is <b>cited</b> by a foreign inventor, this is considered a forward citation.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} how {{standards as}} a knowledge source {{are important for}} R&D, how significantly the (backward) citations by a <b>patent</b> of standard-related <b>documents</b> measure such knowledge flow, and how significantly they affect the performance of downstream R&D. Using both the RIETI inventor survey in Japan and the bibliographic information of triadic patents families, we show that standard information-that embodied in the standards and related documents-has become very important as a knowledge source for the conception of R&D projects in the information and telecommunication area (ICT), and that {{the frequency of the}} <b>patents</b> <b>citing</b> standard <b>documents</b> has been increasing. The citation information in US <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> can be effectively used to measure the knowledge flows from standards to inventions, although it covers only a limited portion of the knowledge flow. The R&D projects intensively using standard information tend to generate valuable patents and also a large number of patents, controlling for research labor input, the use of scientific literature, {{as well as that of}} patent literature. A patent that uses private international forum standards as a knowledge source is significantly more <b>cited</b> than a <b>patent</b> that uses national or international public standards as a knowledge source. ...|$|R

For <b>cited</b> <b>patents</b> therefore, patent citations have a potentially ambiguous impact.

On the other hand, patent citations may indicate competing innovations that render the <b>cited</b> <b>patent</b> obsolete.

40|$|<b>Patent</b> <b>documents</b> are {{important}} intellectual resources of protecting interests of individuals, organizations and companies. These <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> have great research values, {{beneficial to the}} industry, business, law, and policy-making communities. Patent mining aims at assisting patent analysts in investigating, processing, and analyzing <b>patent</b> <b>documents,</b> which has attracted increasing interest in academia and industry. However, despite recent advances in patent mining, several critical issues in current patent mining systems have not been well explored in previous studies. These issues include: 1) the query retrieval problem that assists patent analysts finding all relevant <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> for a given patent application; 2) the <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> comparative summarization problem that facilitates patent analysts in quickly reviewing any given <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> pairs; and 3) the key <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> discovery problem that helps patent analysts to quickly grasp the linkage between different technologies {{in order to better}} understand the technical trend from a collection of <b>patent</b> <b>documents.</b> This dissertation follows the stream of research that covers the aforementioned issues of existing patent analysis and mining systems. In this work, we delve into three interleaved aspects of patent mining techniques, including (1) PatSearch, a framework of automatically generating the search query from a given patent application and retrieving relevant patents to user; (2) PatCom, a framework for investigating the relationship in terms of commonality and difference between <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> pairs, and (3) PatDom, a framework for integrating multiple types of patent information to identify important patents from a large volume of <b>patent</b> <b>documents.</b> In summary, the increasing amount and textual complexity of patent repository lead to a series of challenges that are not well addressed in the current generation systems. My work proposed reasonable solutions to these challenges and provided insights on how to address these challenges using a simple yet effective integrated patent mining framework...|$|R

Moreover, both intra and intersectoral spillovers produce a "turnabout" effect, meaning that <b>citing</b> <b>patents</b> show the opposite quality level of the <b>cited</b> <b>patent.</b> Our results support the idea that more sector-specific environmental policies, with an emphasis on diffusion, would significantly improve the use of environmental technologies developed within the oil and gas industry...|$|R
