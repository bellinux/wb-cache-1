50|$|Image {{resolution}} of SAR in its range coordinate (expressed in image pixels per distance unit) is mainly {{proportional to the}} radio bandwidth of whatever type of pulse is used. In the cross-range coordinate, the similar resolution is mainly proportional to the bandwidth of the Doppler shift of the signal returns within the beamwidth. Since Doppler frequency depends on {{the angle of the}} scattering point's direction from the broadside direction, the Doppler bandwidth available within the beamwidth is the same at all ranges. Hence the theoretical spatial resolution limits in both image dimensions remain constant with variation of range. However, in practice, both the errors that accumulate with data-collection time and the particular techniques used in post-processing further limit <b>cross-range</b> <b>resolution</b> at long ranges.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to realize that only those sub-wavelength differences of successive ranges from the transmitting antenna to each target point and back, which govern signal phase, are used to refine the resolution in any geometric dimension. The central direction and the angular width of the illuminating beam do not contribute directly to creating that fine resolution. Instead, they serve only to select the solid-angle region from which usable range data are received. While some distinguishing of the ranges of different scene items can be made from the forms of their sub-wavelength range variations at short ranges, the very large depth of focus that occurs at long ranges usually requires that over-all range differences (larger than a wavelength) be used to define range resolutions comparable to the achievable <b>cross-range</b> <b>resolution.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{limitations}} in signal bandwidth and array aperture, {{as well as}} the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) make it difficult for an OTHR system to provide good range and <b>cross-range</b> <b>resolutions.</b> Because radar signals are reflected by multiple ionospheric layers, a number of techniques have been developed over the years to exploit the rich multipath propagation associated with moving targets to improve the target localization and tracking performance [4 – 6]. Multipath exploitation radar is also found in other applications, such as through-the-wall and urban terrain sensing [7, 8].|$|R
40|$|Composites {{are being}} {{increasingly}} used to replace metals, in several industries {{because of their}} light weight, corrosion resistance, and mechanical strength. In these structures involving metals and composites, adhesively bonded joints are preferred in contrast to conventional fasteners as they provide light weight designs, reduce stress concentrations. However, disbonds and delamination can compromise {{the integrity of the}} structure affecting their performance. Hence a robust and effective Non Destructive Evaluation (NDE) technique is required to accurately detect defects in composite materials. Microwave NDE is increasingly being used as an alternate method since it is well suited for lossless and low loss dielectric materials because electromagnetic waves can propagate and interact with them [1]. Since the scattered field depends on the dielectric properties of the material, the scattered data contains information related to geometry of the structure. Time Reversal focusing is {{based on the fact that}} when a wave solution is reversed in time and back- propagated it refocuses back at the source. Recent studies by Fink et. al. [2] have shown promising results by extending the concept of time reversal imaging to wideband electromagnetic waves. In the previous year, various simulation results and parametric studies were presented to demonstrate the feasibility of microwave time reversal to detect and characterize disbonds [3]. In this contribution, far field time reversal imaging experiments for such NDE applications will be presented. Far field measurements with an ultra-wideband excitation source (2 - 18 GHz) using a pulsed time domain laboratory setup are processed using a passive time reversal technique. Time reversed images show accurate detection of multiple defects in composite structures. Experiments are also performed to estimate the time reversed down-range and <b>cross-range</b> <b>resolutions.</b> The focusing resolution of the reconstructed image is studied particularly with regard to rapid inspection of large areas. Although preliminary testing is being done in microwave frequencies (2 - 18 GHz), the system can be easily scaled to millimetre or terahertz wave frequencies for increased imaging/detection resolution...|$|R

50|$|Terrestrial or {{ground-based}} SAR Interferometry (GBInSAR or TInSAR) is {{a remote}} sensing technique for the displacement monitoring of slopes, rock scarps, volcanoes, landslides, buildings, infrastructures etc. This technique {{is based on the}} same operational principles of the Satellite SAR Interferometry, but the Synthetic Aperture of the Radar (SAR) is obtained by an antenna moving on a rail instead of a satellite moving around an orbit. SAR technique allows 2D radar image of the investigated scenario to be achieved, with a high range resolution (along the instrumental line of sight) and <b>cross-range</b> <b>resolution</b> (along the scan direction). Two antennas respectively emit and receive microwave signals and, by calculating the phase difference between two measurements taken in two different times, it is possible to compute the displacement of all the pixels of the SAR image. The accuracy in the displacement measurement is of the same order of magnitude as the EM wavelength and depends also on the specific local and atmospheric conditions.|$|E
50|$|In general, a {{microwave}} imaging system has two parts, namely: {{hardware and software}} (or post-processing). The hardware part collects data from the sample under test. A transmitter antenna sends EM waves towards the sample under test (e.g., human body for medical imaging). If the sample is made of only homogeneous material which extends to infinity, theoretically no EM wave will be reflected. Introduction of any anomaly which has different properties (i.e., electrical/magnetic) {{in comparison with the}} surrendering homogeneous medium may reflect a portion of the EM wave. The bigger the difference between the properties of the anomaly and the surrounding medium is, the stronger the reflected wave will be. This reflection will be collected and measured by the same antenna (in monostatic case) or a different receiver antenna (in bistatic case).To increase <b>cross-range</b> <b>resolution</b> of the imaging system, several antennas should be distributed over an area (which is called sampling area) with a spacing less than the operating wavelength. However, by having several antennas placed close to each other, the mutual coupling between antennas may degrade the accuracy of the collected signals. Moreover, transmitter and receiver system will become very complex. To address these problems, one single scanning antenna is used instead of several antennas. Later, when the antenna finishes scanning the entire sampling area, one can put together collected data all over the sampling area and process them together, simultaneously. In fact, a synthetic (virtual) aperture is produced by moving the antenna (similar to the synthetic aperture radar principle). Later, the collected data, which is sometimes referred to as raw data, is fed into the software for processing. Depending on the applied processing algorithm, microwave imaging techniques can be categorized as quantitative and qualitative.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} {{research}} into the eld of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) signal processing. The contributions of this thesis may {{be divided into two}} following parts: A new bistatic 3 D near eld circular SAR imaging algorithm was devel- oped. High resolution radar imaging is typically obtained by combining wide bandwidth signals and synthetic aperture processing. High range resolution is obtained by using modulated signals whereas high cross range resolution is achieved by coherently processing the target echoes at dierent aspect angles of the target. Anyway, theoretical results have shown that when the aspect angle whereby the target is observed is suf- ciently wide, high resolution target images can be obtained by using continuous wave (CW) radars [2], therefore allowing to reduce hardware costs. In a similar way, three dimensional radar imaging can be per- formed by coherently processing the backscattered eld as a function of two rotation angles about two orthogonal axes [3]. Three dimensional tar- get radar imaging can be eciently obtained by means of a 3 D Fourier Transform, when the far-eld (planar wave) approximation holds. Oth- erwise, the wavefront curvature has to be accounted for. For this reason, a new algorithm based on a near eld spherical wave illumination that takes into account the wavefront curvature by adopting a planar piece- wise approximation was designed. This means that the wavefront is as- sumed to be locally planar around a given point on the target. The oper- ator that the algorithm uses for the focusing procedure is a space variant focusing function which aims at compensating the propagation losses and the wavefront curvature. The algorithm has been developed under the Microwave Electronic Imaging Security and Safety Access (MELISSA) project. The system MELISSA is a body scanner whose purpose is the detection of concealed objects. The added value of the system is the capability to provide an electromagnetic image of the concealed objects. The author would like to thank all people that worked at the project, all LabRass colleagues, all people who designed and acquired real data, all people that permitted the drafting of the rst part of this thesis. The developed algorithm was presented in the chapter 1. The goal of this work was the system design concerning the imaging point of view, by simulating and therefore predicting the system performance by means of the developed algorithm. In the chapter 2 was shown how the design was achieved. Finally, in the chapter 3, the results on real data measured in anechoic chamber with a system with characteristics very close to the nal system prototype MELISSA, was presented. A new way of ISAR processing has been dened, by applying the tradi- tional ISAR processing to data acquired from passive radars. Purpose of the ISAR processing is to extract an electromagnetic bi-dimensional im- age of the target {{in order to determine the}} main geometric features of the target, allowing (when possible) recognition and classication. Passive radars are able to detect and track targets by exploiting illuminators of opportunity (IOs). In this work of thesis, it will be proven that the same concept can be extended to allow for Passive Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (P-ISAR) imaging. A suitable signal processing is detailed that is able to form P-ISAR images starting from range-Doppler maps, which represent the output of a passive radar signal processing. Multiple chan- nels Digital Video Broadcasting - Terrestrial (DVB-T) signals are used to demonstrate the concept as they provide enough range resolution to form meaningful ISAR images. The problem of grating lobes, generated by DVB-T signal, is also addressed and solved by proposing an innovative P-ISAR technique. The second part of this thesis has been developed un- der the Array Passive ISAR adaptive processing (APIS) project. APIS is dened as a multichannel, bi-static single receiver for array passive radar, capable of detecting targets and generating ISAR images of the detected targets for classication purposes. The author would like to thank all people that worked at the project, all LabRass colleagues, all people who designed, built the prototype and acquired real data, all people that per- mitted the drafting of the second part of this thesis. In the chapter 4, the basics on Passive Bistatic Radar (PBR) was brie y recalled, the P-ISAR processor was detailed and the new algorithm per the Grating Lobes Cancellation was presented. In the chapter 5, some numerical results on simulated data was shown, in order to demonstrate the potentiality of the P-ISAR, for the imaging and classication purpose. In fact, by using more than three adjacent channels and by observing the signal for a long time, ner range and <b>cross-range</b> <b>resolutions,</b> respectively, could be achieved. Finally, the obtained results on real data was discussed in the chapter 6...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years, Ground based Synthetic Aperture Radar (GB-SAR) {{has proven to}} be a {{powerful}} tool for monitoring displacements and deformation that accompany mass movements like e. g. landslides, glaciers and volcanic hazards. The goal of this thesis is to develop a real-time capable technique that allows to analyse GB-SAR data and assess the state of a mass movement with the least delay possible after a GB-SAR measurement is acquired. The GB-SAR instrument IBIS-L allows the remote monitoring of an object at a distance of up to 4 km by transmitting microwaves at a frequency of 17. 2 GHz and receiving the reflected echoes. Every 5 to 10 minutes, it delivers a twodimensional amplitude and phase image with a range resolution of 0. 75 m and a <b>cross-range</b> (azimuth) <b>resolution</b> of 4. 4 mrad (4. 4 m at a distance of 1 km). The amplitude depends on object geometry and reflectivity. By computing the difference of two phase images observed at two different points in time, displacements in line-of-sight can be derived for each resolution cell. Only relative phase differences can be formed (ranging between -pi and +pi), thus, the number of full phase cycles (i. e. phase ambiguity) is unknown. Apart from displacements, the phase difference is also influenced by atmospheric disturbances and noise. To determine displacements, it is necessary to unwrap the phase differences (i. e. determine the phase ambiguities) and estimate the atmospheric effect for each resolution cell and for each time step. Many different methods exist for phase unwrapping, mainly developed for spaceborne SAR. The term Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) describes a set of techniques, which analyses only phase time series at persistent scatterers (PS), i. e. resolution cells with a good phase standard deviation (usually less then 0. 3 to 0. 4 rad) (Ferretti et al., 2001; Kampes, 2006). The common PSI methods are, however, not directly real-time capable as they analyse time series. The real-time analysis tool described in this thesis is especially designed for GB-SAR requirements. It is a combination of PSI with Multi Model Adaptive Estimation (MMAE) (Marinkovic et al., 2005; Brown and Hwang, 1997). The PS are selected according to Ferretti et al. (2001) using the amplitude dispersion index, which describes the phase accuracy. Only a subset of this selection, the PS candidates (PSC), are used for phase unwrapping and estimation of the atmosphere. Due to temporal changes of PS quality, caused by e. g. rock falls, the PSC selection is changing with time. To simplify the unwrapping, the ambiguities are not estimated from the time series itself but rather on the difference of the time series of two neighbouring PSC. By that the atmospheric effect is reduced. For each possible ambiguity solution of a time series difference, a Kalman Filter exists to sequentially estimate the state of a kinematic process. At each time step new observations are added to the filter. The best ambiguity solution is selected based on probabilities, which are computed from the difference between observed and predicted phase. After this temporal unwrapping, a spatial unwrapping is performed for each time step to make sure that the determined solution is spatially consistent. The atmospheric effect is estimated after the unwrapping using a combination of meteorological data and filtering. Finally, the remaining PS are integrated into the network. With this technique, a first estimation of the displacements at the PS is available a few seconds to minutes after the data acquisition. With every time step, new observations are added, which will improve the determination of ambiguities until they can be fixed. Thus, the final estimation of displacements is available a few minutes to one hour after the data acquisition. The performance of the technique is shown by unwrapping synthetic data and real data from observation campaigns at four different locations: a quarry in Dieburg, Germany, a mountain side in Bad Reichenhall, Germany, a caldera flank on Sao Miguel, Azores and a landslide near Innsbruck in the Austrian Alps...|$|R

30|$|The {{rotation}} angle Θ is usually 3 °– 5 ° because the smaller angle is inadequate for high resolution and the migration through resolution cell (MTRC) will occur if Θ is larger [18]. Moreover, the sampling {{rate in the}} cross-range dimension, e.g., the PRF of radar, {{must be at least}} twice the Doppler bandwidth of the target, which is proportional to the target’s rotation velocity. Hence, targets with different rotation velocities need different PRFs for equivalent <b>cross-range</b> <b>resolution.</b> Faster rotation means that the CPI for one image is shorter and a higher PRF is required. The reference [19] suggests that the expected resolution of CS reconstructed image is restricted by the incoherency of the sensing matrix. In CS ISAR imaging, since the random pulses are the subset of Nyquist-sampled pulses in RD imaging, Eq. (11) still determines the <b>cross-range</b> <b>resolution,</b> and enough {{rotation angle}} is also required for high resolution.|$|E

The <b>cross-range</b> <b>resolution</b> of successive subimages are illustrated.|$|E
30|$|Inverse {{synthetic}} aperture radar (ISAR) imaging has been a widely addressed topic in last few decades [1 – 3]. In order to achieve high-resolution both in range and cross-range of target imagery, the ISAR imaging technique exploits both wideband characteristics of radar waveform and the diversity of viewing aspect angle from radar to the target. In general, the range resolution is proportional to bandwidth of waveform, and the <b>cross-range</b> <b>resolution</b> is dependent on both the coherent processing interval (CPI) and the target rotational motion from variation of radar viewing angles. Therefore, CPI should be long enough to achieve high <b>cross-range</b> <b>resolution</b> by Doppler analysis. In ISAR scenarios, the target is often engaged in complicated maneuvers and the translational motion should be compensated before performing imaging processing. Translational motion introduces range misalignment and high-order phase error. For ISAR imaging of a non-cooperative target, a data-driven compensation procedure must be accounted, which generally consists of range alignment and phase adjustment.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) {{produces}} {{high resolution}} microwave images: the range resolution is c/ 2 B, where c is {{the speed of}} light and B is the bandwidth of the transmitted signal (typically a chirp signal); the <b>cross-range</b> <b>resolution</b> is approximately A/ 2 A 0, where A is the transmission wavelength and A 0 is the angle under which each point on the scene is observed from the radar [4]. The high <b>cross-range</b> <b>resolution</b> is obtained by coherently integrating the echoes received from each point of the observed scene during the observation interval. The coherent integration allows synthesis of an aperture much greater than the real aperture.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a sparse superresolution approach for high <b>cross-range</b> <b>resolution</b> imaging of forward-looking scanning radar {{based on the}} Bayesian criterion. First, a novel forward-looking signal model is established {{as the product of}} the measurement matrix and the cross-range target distribution, which is more accurate than the conventional convolution model. Then, based on the Bayesian criterion, the widely-used sparse regularization is considered as the penalty term to recover the target distribution. The derivation of the cost function is described, and finally, an iterative expression for minimizing this function is presented. Alternatively, this paper discusses how to estimate the single parameter of Gaussian noise. With the advantage of a more accurate model, the proposed sparse Bayesian approach enjoys a lower model error.

30|$|Inverse {{synthetic}} aperture radar (ISAR) can generate images of targets with high resolution in two dimensions. It usually transmits wideband waveform to obtain high-range resolution and utilizes coherent integration of multi-pulse to achieve high <b>cross-range</b> <b>resolution</b> [1].

40|$|For high {{resolution}} imaging of a non-cooperative moving target, this paper proposes a sparse fusion imaging method. The imaging system contains two radar stations, which {{are separated by}} a certain bistatic angle and configured in a transmitter/receiver-receiver (T/R-R) manner. Consequently, two synthetic apertures are obtained {{at the same time}} from different aspect angles. By coherently fusing the echoes of the two radars, a virtual aperture spanned by these two sub-apertures can be constructed, which is larger than either of the sub-apertures; thus, the <b>cross-range</b> <b>resolution</b> of the image is enhanced. Moreover, the fusion of the echoes is realized by exploiting the sparse scattering property of the target. Then, based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion, the T/R-R fusion imaging problem is converted into a sparse signal recovery problem with unknown parameters. Finally, it is solved in an iterative manner, which contains two steps, i. e., sparse imaging and parameter estimation.
