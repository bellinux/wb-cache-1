5|$|The Plateosaurus skeletons in a <b>clay</b> <b>pit</b> of the Tonwerke Keller AG in Frick, Switzerland, {{were first}} noticed in 1976. While the bones are often {{significantly}} deformed by taphonomic processes, Frick yields skeletons of P.engelhardti comparable in completeness and position {{to those of}} Trossingen and Halberstadt.|$|E
5|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of Brancasaurus brancai is GPMM A3.B4, stored at the University of Münster. It originates from a <b>clay</b> <b>pit</b> {{near the city}} of Gronau, North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. The specimen was discovered in July 1910 by workers in the <b>clay</b> <b>pit,</b> who dug it out using pickaxes; in doing so, they damaged the specimen (in particular, the pubis had been broken into 176 pieces), and left behind a number of small fragments that were later personally collected by paleontologist Theodor Wegner, who in 1928 described the specimen in detail. The skeleton is fairly complete, consisting of various parts of the skull, most of the vertebrae, several isolated ribs and gastralia, parts of the pectoral and pelvic girdles, both humeri, one femur, and various foot bones from the flippers. Over time, a number of parts have been lost, including several pieces of the skull, teeth, gastralia and caudal vertebrae, a second femur, and a radius, tibia, and fibula. A wax endocast of the brain of the type specimen is stored as SMF R4076 in the Naturmuseum Senckenberg.|$|E
5|$|Bordering Prospect Park is Devil's Dip, {{a former}} gravel and <b>clay</b> <b>pit.</b> The site is {{recognised}} by Reading Borough Council {{as an area}} of wildlife and historical interest, and examples of elm, walnut, ash, horse chestnut and sycamore trees grow there. Other flora found at the site include nettle, bramble and elder, with flowers such as lesser celandine, bluebells and Queen Anne's lace appearing in the spring. Peacock butterflies and various species of woodland bird are prevalent in the area.|$|E

5|$|Material {{assigned}} to Plateosaurus {{has been found}} at over 50 localities in Germany (mainly along the Neckar and Pegnitz river valleys), Switzerland (Frick) and France. Three localities are of special importance, because they yielded specimens in large numbers and of unusually good quality: near Halberstadt in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany; Trossingen in Baden-Württemberg, Germany; and Frick. Between the 1910s and 1930s, excavations in a <b>clay</b> <b>pit</b> in Saxony-Anhalt revealed between 39 and 50 skeletons that belonged to Plateosaurus, along with teeth and {{a small number of}} bones of the theropod Liliensternus, and two skeletons and some fragments of the turtle Proganochelys. Some of the plateosaur material was {{assigned to}} P.longiceps, a species described by palaeontologist Otto Jaekel in 1914 but now considered a junior synonym of P.engelhardti. Most of the material found its way to the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, where much of it was destroyed during World War II. The Halberstadt quarry today is covered by a housing development.|$|E
5|$|On 7 January 1983 amateur fossil hunter William J. Walker {{discovered}} a large claw, a phalanx bone, {{and part of}} a rib in Smokejacks Pit, a <b>clay</b> <b>pit</b> near Ockley in Surrey, England. The tip of the claw was missing, but Walker found it a week later. British palaeontologists Alan J. Charig and Angela C. Milner examined the finds at the Natural History Museum of London and found more bones at the site on 7 February, but the entire skeleton could not be collected until May and June due to conditions at the pit. A team of eight museum staff members and several volunteers excavated two tonnes of matrix. Walker donated the claw to the museum, and the Ockley Brick Company (owners of the pit) donated the rest of the skeleton and provided equipment. The area had been explored for 200 years, but no similar remains had been found before.|$|E
25|$|Many small ponds in {{the area}} are {{remnants}} of clay pits dug in the 19th century, as clay was a major industry. The Perrine <b>clay</b> <b>pit</b> was located near Route 9 and Ernston Road.|$|E
50|$|Many Swartzia fossils {{from the}} middle Eocene epoch are known from the United States. 5 fossil dehiscent seed pods and 50 fossil {{leaflets}} have been described from the Warman and Lawrence <b>clay</b> <b>pits</b> in Weakley and the Henry Counties,Tennessee. In addition 6 leaflets have been described from the New Lawrence and Miller <b>clay</b> <b>pits</b> in Henry County, Tennessee.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, {{the line to}} Norden clay works had been {{extended}} over the main line railway to serve <b>clay</b> <b>pits</b> on its western side. This line was extended across the Wareham to Corfe Castle road by a level crossing to serve further <b>clay</b> <b>pits</b> to the north east. However, {{by this time the}} plateway's days were numbered. The channel at Middlebere was silting up, limiting the size of vessel that could approach the quay. The company already had a deeper-water quay at Goathorn on the southern shore of Poole Harbour, used for the export of <b>clay</b> from <b>pits</b> at nearby Newton.|$|R
25|$|Claypits Close {{was built}} in about 2007 and named after the old <b>clay</b> <b>pit</b> on which it was built. There were many small, Victorian clay pits and kilns in the south west of Banbury, but they had closed by the 1920s.|$|E

25|$|This {{ran from}} {{south-east}} of Woodnesborough station to Woodnesborough Colliery, which mine failed and became Hammill brickworks. This spur survived until 1951. A narrow-gauge line was parallel {{to it on}} the west, between brickworks and <b>clay</b> <b>pit,</b> and this still featured on the 1959 OS map, {{five years after the}} EKLR had been pulled up.|$|E
25|$|A brickworks, the Knowle Brick Company, existed off Mill Lane {{with its}} own <b>clay</b> <b>pit.</b> The company ceased {{production}} in 1969, and whole the site was converted to housing in 1993 by Bloor Homes. The extent of the brickworks and pit site {{is the same as}} that now occupied by all the housing accessed via Oakhall Drive.|$|E
25|$|Later {{the area}} was {{developed}} by Yap Kwan Seng, the fifth and last Kapitan Cina of Kuala Lumpur. As a businessman, he foresaw an increased demand for bricks in fast-growing Kuala Lumpur and established a kiln in the district. The area soon became the centre for brick-making {{in the early days}} because the whole area was a <b>clay</b> <b>pit</b> and good quality bricks are made from clay. Therefore, Brickfields became synonymous with good quality bricks.|$|E

25|$|On 23 May 1874, James Shopland of the Swindon Brick and Tyle Company {{reported}} to Professor Richard Owen that their <b>clay</b> <b>pit,</b> the Swindon Great Quarry below Old Swindon Hill at Swindon in Wiltshire, had again produced a fossil skeleton. Owen sent out William Davies {{to secure the}} specimen, which proved to be encased in an eight feet high clay nodule. During an attempt to lift it in its entirety, the loam clump crumbled into several pieces. These were eventually transported to London in crates with a total weight of three tonnes. The bones were subsequently partially uncovered by Owen's preparator, the mason Caleb Barlow.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} sites for beetle fossils of the Miocene are {{situated in the}} warm temperate and to subtropical zones. Many recent genera and species already existed during the Miocene, however, their distribution differed considerably from today's. One of the {{most important}} fossil sites for insects of the Pliocene is Willershausen near Göttingen, Germany with excellently preserved beetle fossils of various families (longhorn beetles, weevils, ladybugs and others) as well as representatives of other orders of insects. In the Willershausen <b>clay</b> <b>pit</b> so far 35 genera from 18 beetle families have been recorded, of which six genera are extinct. The Pleistocene beetle fauna is relatively well known, who used the composition of the beetle fauna to reconstruct climate conditions in the Rocky Mountains and on Beringia, the former land bridge between Asia and North America.|$|E
500|$|Construction on {{the first}} {{buildings}} started in 1926. San Marco was originally planned in the Italian Renaissance revival style, which influenced {{the name of the}} development and several of its streets. The commercial district was called [...] "San Marco Square" [...] after Venice's Piazza San Marco, and featured several Mediterranean buildings and a fountain. Ultimately, however, few of the homes built there kept to the style, which was falling out of favor at the time. Instead, a diverse mix of contemporary architectural styles appeared in the development in the late 1920s. A former <b>clay</b> <b>pit</b> was landscaped into an artificial lake, Lake Marco.|$|E

500|$|A brickworks and <b>clay</b> <b>pit</b> {{were served}} by the next siding. It was not {{constructed}} until 1936, and continued in use until the line closed. The line rose on an embankment to cross the A161 road, and then entered a cutting, where it was joined by the Hatfield Moors branch, the two running parallel for some [...] before the cutting became an embankment, and they joined near Epworth station. Epworth had a passing loop and sidings to the east, with the track crossing the High Street on a brick bridge {{to the south of}} the station.|$|E
500|$|The <b>clay</b> <b>pit</b> {{from which}} the type {{specimen}} originates {{is part of the}} Isterberg Formation in the Bückeberg Group, also known in the past as the [...] "German Wealden facies". The Bückeberg Group, which is divided into six zones, belongs to the Berriasian of the Cretaceous, with the boundary between the Berriasian and the Valanginian being {{at the top of the}} group. The parts of the Isterberg Formation exposed at Gronau belong to the zones [...] "Wealden 5" [...] and [...] "Wealden 6", which correspond to the uppermost-Berriasian. A second, more fragmentary subadult individual, GZG.BA.0079, consists of the pubis, ischium, and several vertebral components; it originates from the slightly lower Deister Formation ("Wealden 3") in the Bückeberg Group, and can only be referred to Brancasaurus sp., since it is relatively incomplete and differs in several minor vertebral characteristics from the type of B. brancai. Other probable but isolated Brancasaurus elements come from outcrops of the Isterberg and Fuhse Formations in Lower Saxony; the latter formation is also in the Bückeberg Group.|$|E
500|$|In 1927, German {{paleontologist}} Friedrich von Huene new genus for Cetiosaurus leedsi and its specimens BMNH R.1984–1988 and BMNH R.3078, Cetiosauriscus, after identifying sufficient {{differences from}} the former genus. He based his new name off Cetiosaurus ("whale lizard") by adding the Latin suffix iscus, meaning [...] "like", translating fully to [...] "whale lizard like". In 1939 Huene also moved [...] "Ornithopsis" [...] greppini, a species from Switzerland, to Cetiosauriscus, creating the new combination [...] "Cetiosauriscus" [...] greppini. In 1980 Alan J. Charig concluded that {{due to lack of}} comparable bones, BMNH R.3078 could not be assigned to the same taxon as BMNH R1984–1988, and created a new species for the former: Cetiosauriscus stewarti. The specific name was chosen to honour Sir Ronald Stewart, the chairman of the London Brick Company, which owned the <b>clay</b> <b>pit</b> the fossils had been found in. Furthermore, Charig considered both C. leedsi and [...] "C." [...] greppini nomina dubia, and C. stewarti valid. In 1993, Charig decided to send a petition to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), to ask them to change the type species of Cetiosauriscus from the dubious C. leedsi, to the taxonomically stable C. stewarti. This was accepted by the ICZN in 1995, making BMNH R.3078, the holotype of C. stewarti, the basis for Cetiosauriscus. C. stewarti is senior synonym in partim of Ornithopsis leedsi (=Cetiosauriscus leedsi; Cetiosaurus leedsi), as its holotype was once referred to this taxon.|$|E
