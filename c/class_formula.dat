In its first year Tim Schenken took the BRSCC Formula Ford 1600 championship title. The following season was also highly successful with Luiz Pereira Bueno finishing second in the championship. Emerson Fittipaldi drove a Merlyn {{for a short time}} in the Formula Ford championship before graduating into Formula 3. This MK 11A, chassis 238, had become known as the 'Magic Merlyn'. Fittipaldi sold the car to Colin Vandervell for the 1970 season. The MK 12 designed for Formula 2 scored one point in the European championship with Brian Hart in 1968. The following season brought even less success in the Formula 1 constructor dominated <b>class.</b> <b>Formula</b> 3 frontrunner Tony Lanfranchi was sidelined after a traffic accident in 1969.

[...] Together with their Formula 3 engine Toyota launched their own racing <b>class,</b> <b>Formula</b> Toyota. The first generation car, the Argo-Tom's FT10, uses an aluminium monocoque. The car was powered by a Toyota 4A-GE engine, which produced 140hp. The FT10 was used until 1994 when it {{was replaced by a}} Tom's built FT20. This car was powered by a 5-valve engine, replacing the previous 4-valve engine. In 1995 the Formula Toyota Racing School was founded and the best driver from each class won a fully funded drive in the Formula Toyota championship. Between 1991 and 1999 there were two Formula Toyota championships, Main and West. But after the fields became smaller Toyota merged the two classes into one class for the 2000 season. The championships last race was on November 25th 2007 at Fuji International Speedway. The race was won by Italian-Japanese driver Kei Cozzolino.

After a couple of seasons racing in the one-make HQ Holden series, an {{impressive}} top five championship result in the inaugural Toyota Racing Series led to a move to Australia and two seasons in the popular V8 Utes series. For the 2006 season, Pither joined Brad Jones Racing in the second-tier Fujitsu V8 Supercar Series backed by his V8 Utes sponsor, Kanga Loaders. A sporadic 2007 campaign, switching teams mid season did not bring positive results, however still managed to join tail-marking main-game V8 Supercars outfit Team Kiwi Racing for four rounds during the 14-event season. After subbing for regular driver Kayne Scott at the Eastern Creek Raceway round, he then participated in a second round at the Winton Motor Raceway, although the results were not spectacular. The endurance races were particularly disappointing after an engine failure in practice saw Team Kiwi Racing withdraw from the L&H 500. Pither {{was involved in a}} major accident during practice for the Supercheap Auto 1000. Pither struck a stationary Paul Weel with a heavy impact at Reid Park corner, causing extensive damage to both cars and hospitalising Weel.

Primary 68 Q 15, 03 B 05, 68 T 15; Secondary 90 C 09. 1 Introduction The reader is supposed to be familiar with the basic terminology and facts regarding the Satisfiability Problem (see [7] for a survey). Some well known tractable classes of Satisfiability Problems are known as Horn [5], renamable Horn [9], extended Horn [3], balanced [4, 12], SLUR (Single Lookahead Unit Resolution) [10], the latter class including the preceding ones, and q-Horn [2, 1, 11]. The <b>class</b> of q-Horn <b>formulas</b> includes (renamable) Horn and 2 -SAT. Franco [6] has shown that SLUR and q-Horn are incomparable extensions of Horn.

40|$|One of the {{distinguishing}} features of logic programming {{seems to be}} the notion of goal-directed provability, i. e. that the structure of the goal is used to determine {{the next step in the}} proof search process.
