40|$|To {{increase}} {{young people}} 2 ̆ 7 s physical activity (PA) levels {{it is important}} to understand the <b>correlates</b> of PA in children and adolescents. We sought to identify factors associated with children 2 ̆ 7 s and adolescents 2 ̆ 7 PA by reviewing systematic quantitative reviews of non-intervention research. Systematic reviews examining associations between quantitatively measured variables and PA in young people (< 19 years) from 2000 - 2010 were identified using electronic and manual searches. Nine systematic reviews were identified. Demographic/biological <b>correlates</b> of PA were age and gender. Psychological <b>correlates</b> of PA were positive motivation, positive body image and the existence of barriers to PA. Behavioural <b>correlates</b> of PA were previous PA, sport participation, smoking, and sedentary behaviour. Social/cultural <b>correlates</b> of PA were parental influence and social support, and environmental <b>correlates</b> of PA were access to facilities, distance from home to school, time spent outside, and local crime. The evidence is suggestive of a number of different types of <b>correlates</b> of PA for children and adolescents. Beyond age and gender, though, most are likely to have only small or small-to-moderate effects in isolation and may work best in interaction with other influences.

50|$|The {{ground state}} Ψ12Ψ22 of 1,3-butadiene <b>correlates</b> {{with the ground}} state σ2π2 of cyclobutene as {{demonstrated}} in the MO correlation diagram above. Ψ1 <b>correlates</b> with π and Ψ2 <b>correlates</b> with σ. Thus the orbitals making up Ψ12Ψ22 must transform into the orbitals making up σ2π2 under a conrotatory mechanism. However, the state ES-1 does not <b>correlate</b> with the state ES-1' as the molecular orbitals do not transform into each other under the symmetry-requirement seen in the molecular orbital correlation diagram. Instead as Ψ1 <b>correlates</b> with π, Ψ2 <b>correlates</b> with σ, and Ψ3 <b>correlates</b> with σ*, the state Ψ12Ψ2Ψ3 attempts to transform into π2σσ*, which is a different excited state. So ES-1 attempts to <b>correlate</b> with ES-2'=σπ2σ*, which is higher in energy than Es-1'. Similarly ES-1'=σ2ππ* attempts to <b>correlate</b> with ES-2=Ψ1Ψ22Ψ4. These correlations can not actually take place due to the quantum-mechanical rule known as the avoided crossing rule. This says that energetic configurations of the same symmetry can not cross on an energy level correlation diagram. In short, this is caused by mixing of states of the same symmetry when brought close enough in energy. So instead a high energetic barrier is formed between a forced transformation of ES-1 into ES-1'. In the diagram below the symmetry-preferred correlations are shown in dashed lines and the bold curved lines indicate the actual correlation with the high energetic barrier.|$|R

40|$|Background Binge eating (BE) {{has long}} been {{identified}} as a <b>correlate</b> of overweight and obesity. However, less empirical attention has been given to overeating with and without loss of control (LOC) in nonclinical samples. Purpose The goal {{of the present study was}} to examine the association of (1) established <b>correlates</b> of BE, namely, weight and shape concerns, dietary restraint, and negative affect, and (2) three additional <b>correlates,</b> disinhibition, hun-ger, and interoceptive awareness (IA), to overeating in a nonclinical sample of college women. Method Female students (n= 1, 447) aged 18 to 21 years recruited from colleges in three Canadian metropolitan areas completed self-report questionnaires in class to assess sociodemographic and anthropomorphic characteristics, overeating, LOC, dietary restraint, negative affect, weight and shape concerns, IA, disinhibition, and hunger. Results The established <b>correlates</b> of BE were significant <b>correlates</b> of all types of overeating and explained 33 % of the variance. Disinhibition was the most strongly associated <b>correlate</b> of overeating. Conclusions Findings suggest that established <b>correlates</b> of BE are associated with other types of overeating such as objective overeating (OOE), as are disinhibition and hunger...|$|R
40|$|Identification of immune <b>correlates</b> of {{protection}} after vaccination {{is an important}} part of vaccinology for both theoretical and practical reasons. The terminology and definition of <b>correlates</b> have been confusing, because different authors have used variable terms and concepts. Here, we attempt to give precision to the field by defining 3 terms: <b>correlate</b> {{of protection}} (CoP), mechanistic <b>correlate</b> of protection (mCoP), and nonmechanistic <b>correlate</b> of protection (nCoP). A CoP is a marker of immune function that statistically <b>correlates</b> with protection after vaccination that may be either an mCoP, which is a mechanistic cause of protection, or an nCoP, which does not cause protection but nevertheless predicts protection through its (partial) correlation with another immune response(s) that mechanistically protects. The identification of immune markers that <b>correlate</b> with protection against infection or disease after vacci-nation (or natural infection) is an important quest. In addition to their basic immunologic interest, those immune markers enable the correct choice of antigens to include in vaccines, determine individual and pop-ulation immunity, bridge from previously collecte...|$|R

40|$|Background Gross motor {{competence}} confers health benefits, but {{levels in}} children and adolescents are low. While interventions can improve gross motor competence, it remains unclear which <b>correlates</b> should be targeted to ensure interventions are most effective, and for whom targeted and tailored interventions should be developed. Objective The aim of this systematic review was to identify the potential <b>correlates</b> of gross motor competence in typically developing children and adolescents (aged 3 – 18 years) using an ecological approach. Methods Motor competence was defined as gross motor skill competency, encompassing fundamental movement skills and motor coordination, but excluding motor fitness. Studies needed to assess a summary score of at least one aspect of motor competence (i. e., object control, locomotor, stability, or motor coordination). A structured electronic literature search was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Six electronic databases (CINAHL Complete, ERIC, MEDLINE Complete, PsycINFO, Scopus and SPORTDiscus with Full Text) were searched from 1994 to 5 August 2014. Meta-analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between potential <b>correlates</b> and motor competency if at least three individual studies investigated the same <b>correlate</b> and also reported standardized regression coefficients. Results A total of 59 studies were identified from 22 different countries, published between 1995 and 2014. Studies reflected the full range of age groups. The most examined <b>correlates</b> were biological and demographic factors. Age (increasing) was a <b>correlate</b> of children’s motor competence. Weight status (healthy), sex (male) and socioeconomic background (higher) were consistent <b>correlates</b> for certain aspects of motor competence only. Physical activity and sport participation constituted the majority of investigations in the behavioral attributes and skills category. Whilst we found physical activity to be a positive <b>correlate</b> of skill composite and motor coordination, we also found indeterminate evidence for physical activity being a <b>correlate</b> of object control or locomotor skill competence. Few studies investigated cognitive, emotional and psychological factors, cultural and social factors or physical environment factors as <b>correlates</b> of motor competence. Conclusion This systematic review is the first that has investigated <b>correlates</b> of gross motor competence {{in children and}} adolescents. A strength is that we categorized <b>correlates</b> according to the specific ways motor competence has been defined and operationalized (object control, motor coordination, etc.), which enables us to have an understanding of what <b>correlates</b> assist what types of motor competence. Indeed our findings do suggest that evidence for some <b>correlates</b> differs according to how motor competence is operationalized...|$|R
