Two studies employed an attachment theory approach to investigate the construct validity of symbolic attachment to one’s nation of origin, and its association with acculturation (operationalized as heritage and mainstream <b>culture</b> <b>identification).</b> Results for Study 1 indicated a three-factor structure of nation attachment; the factors were labelled secure-preoccupied, fearful, and dismissive nation attachment.

40|$|Abstract Background Ureaplasma urealyticum and U. parvum {{have been}} {{associated}} with respiratory diseases in premature newborns, but their role in the pathogenesis of the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is unclear. The aim {{of this study was to}} detect, using molecular techniques, the role of Mycoplasma spp. and Ureaplasma spp. in respiratory secretion and blood specimens of preterm newborns with or without RDS and to evaluate the prevalence of perinatal U. urealyticum or U. parvum infection. The influence of chemotherapy on the clinical course was also evaluated. Methods Tracheal aspirate or nasopharingeal fluid samples from 50 preterm babies with (24) or without RDS (26) were analysed for detection of U. urealyticum and U. parvum by <b>culture</b> <b>identification</b> assay and PCR.

40|$|Rapid {{identification}} of microorganisms in blood cultures {{is required to}} optimize empirical treatment at an early stage. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can reduce the time to {{identification of}} microorganisms in growth-positive blood cultures. In this study, we evaluated the performance, time to identification, and potential clinical benefits of FISH compared to those of conventional culture methods in routine practice. After Gram staining, blood culture fluids were simultaneously further identified with FISH and with conventional culture methods. Results and points in time of FISH and <b>culture</b> <b>identification</b> (provisional and final identifications) were collected and compared. For 91 % of microorganisms, the genus or family name was identified, and for 79 %, the species name could be attributed. The sensitivity and specificity of the individual probes exceeded 95 %, except for the Enterobacteriaceae probe (sensitivity, 89 %). Cross-hybridization was obtained with the Klebsiella pneumoniae probe for Klebsiella oxytoca. The time gains of FISH and final <b>culture</b> <b>identification</b> were more than 18 h for bacteria and 42 h for yeasts. With FISH, Staphylococcus aureus was differentiated from coagulase-negative staphylococci 1. 4 h faster than by provisional identification (P < 0. 001). In conclusion, FISH allows rapid and reliable identification {{of the majority of}} microorganisms in growth-positive blood cultures. The substantial time gain of identification with FISH may allow same-day adjustment of antimicrobial therapy, and FISH is especially useful if no provisional identification is obtained. With further extension of the number of probes and a reduction in turnaround time, FISH will become a very useful diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of bloodstream infection...|$|R

40|$|The unidimensional {{model of}} {{acculturation}} posits that heritage and mainstream <b>culture</b> <b>identifications</b> {{have a strong}} inverse relation, whereas the bidimensional model posits that the 2 identifications are independent. The authors compared these models in 3 samples of ethnic Chinese (ns = 164, 150, and 204), 1 sample of non-Chinese East Asians (n = 70), and one diverse group of accultumting individuals (n = 140). Although the unidimensional measure showed a coherent pattern of external correlates, the bidimensional measure revealed independent dimensions corresponding to heritage and mainstream <b>culture</b> <b>identification.</b> These dimensions displayed patterns of noninverse correlations with personality, self-identity, and psychosocial adjustment. The authors conclude that the bidimensional model is a more valid and useful operationalization of acculturation. The culture in which people live {{plays an important role}} in shaping their sense of self. Indeed, one facet of people's self-identity is that they belong to a certain cultural group. Thus, they have a sense of themselves as being, for example, Canadian, American, or Chinese. When an individual moves from one culture to another, many aspects of self-identity are modified to accom-modate information about and experiences within the new culture. This process, generally referred to as acculturation, involves changes that take place as a result of continuous and direct contact between individuals having different cultural origins (Redfield, Linton, & Herskovits, 1936). Such changes may be observed in a number of different domains, including attitudes, behaviors, val-ues, and sense of cultural identity. At a fundamental level, then, acculturation involves alterations in the individual's sense of self. An examination of the extant literature on the acculturation process reveals two predominant formulations, which we term th...|$|R

In total, 260 of 301 episodes of fever were evaluable and were classified as probable, possible, unlikely or unclassifiable VAD-associated infection. The sensitivity of the 16 S rDNA assay declined concomitantly with delays from time of presentation to sampling. The sensitivity with > 0. 125 pg of bacterial DNA/μL of whole blood was 80 % for the 20 probable VAD-associated infections diagnosed with samples collected {{on the day of}} or day following presentation. The specificity rose with increasing amounts of bacterial DNA, from 93 % with > 0. 125 pg, to 98 % with 0. 25 – 0. 5 pg, and to 100 % with > 0. 5 pg/μL blood. The positive predictive value (for probable or possible) was 88 % (95 % CI 70 – 98 %) with 0. 25 pg/μL, and 100 % (95 % CI 83 – 100 %) with > 0. 5 pg/μL.
