Regime scholars usually draw on Stephen Krasner's influential definition of regimes, first formulated in 1983. His characterisation of regimes as "principles, norms, rules, and decision-making procedures around which actors' expectations converge in a given issue area" (Krasner 1983 : 1) is now widely cited and accepted. Yet, not unlike the often impenetrable <b>compromise</b> <b>texts</b> of international agreements, this definition hides more than it reveals.

Switzerland and the European Commission, for their part, contributed to facilitating the adoption of a <b>compromise</b> <b>text.</b> The final version of the Unidroit Convention gives thus seemingly reason to the partisans of the systemic-functional approach, while making prevail, in practice, the functional-contractual approach supported by the Anglo-Saxon negotiators.|$|E

40|$|Mind-wandering {{refers to}} a {{phenomenon}} of having thoughts unrelated to the task at hand. Its occurrences have been documented across different activities in both experimentally controlled and real-life situations. Furthermore, evidence suggests that one’s mind may start to wander at will and in moments when we preferred it did not. Indeed, mind-wandering {{has been linked to}} deterioration of performance in a number of activities. One example is <b>compromised</b> <b>text</b> comprehension: Experiencing mind-wandering episodes is unconducive to efficient reading. One way we could hope to attenuate the negative influence of mind-wandering on performance is to recognize it and avoid it. However, because one may not be aware that their mind has wandered, we need to rely on external means of discovering mind-wandering. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art methods of detecting mind-wandering are imprecise and impractical. In this dissertation, I attempt to ameliorate some of these methodological deficiencies by developing an alternative, a completely unobtrusive way of detecting mindless reading (i. e., mind-wandering during reading). The ability to read is {{the sine qua non of}} daily life in literate societies and has been studied for over 40 years. However, mindless reading literature is far less voluminous. Because of that, I approach mindless reading detection by first systematically studying mindless reading itself thus expanding our understanding of this still nebulous cognitive phenomenon. Eye movements play a central role in this work. Interestingly, even though text comprehension may cease entirely during mindless reading, eyes of mindless readers move remarkably similar to those of mindful readers. Despite that, my results suggest that eye movements can be used to successfully disentangle these two modes of reading...|$|R
40|$|To assure cyber {{security}} of an enterprise, typically SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) {{system is in}} place to normalize security event from different preventive technologies and flag alerts. Analysts in the security operation center (SOC) investigate the alerts to decide if it is truly malicious or not. However, generally the number of alerts is overwhelming with majority of them being false positive and exceeding the SOC's capacity to handle all alerts. There is a great need to reduce the false positive rate as much as possible. While most previous research focused on network intrusion detection, we focus on risk detection and propose an intelligent Deep Belief Network machine learning system. The system leverages alert information, various security logs and analysts' investigation results in a real enterprise environment to flag hosts that have high likelihood of being <b>compromised.</b> <b>Text</b> mining and graph based method are used to generate targets and create features for machine learning. In the experiment, Deep Belief Network is compared with other machine learning algorithms, including multi-layer neural network, random forest, support vector machine and logistic regression. Results on real enterprise data indicate that the deep belief network machine learning system performs better than other algorithms for our problem and is six times more effective than current rule-based system. We also implement the whole system from data collection, label creation, feature engineering to host score generation in a real enterprise production environment. Comment: 10 pages, 10 figures.

[...] Bishop Williamson, in his weekly message, attacked Fellay for being too open to dialogue between the Society of St. Pius X and the Holy See.

The Council emphasised that ‘agreement on the Constitutional Treaty should be reached no later than the June European Council’. This statement referred to the Irish Presidency’s opinion that there was a real possibility of reaching a compromise on decision-making by a qualified majority, ‘based on the principle of double majority’, which ‘must allow for greater efficiency in the decision making process than the provisions in the current Treaties, and must have due regard to balance among all member States and to their specific concerns’. In reference to other complex issues, such as the size and composition of the Commission, the scope for qualified majority voting and minimum seat thresholds in the European Parliament, the Irish Presidency considered that an overall solution could be found ‘if there is sufficient political will and flexibility’...|$|R
40|$|The <b>compromise</b> <b>text</b> {{for reform}} of the CAP was {{distributed}} at the June EU Agricultural Council meeting. It proposed a number of changes, notably: establishing an earlier start date for modulation; increasing support for young farmers through the rural development regulation; the maintenance of rotational set aside; the exclusion of certain payments from decoupling, including sheep and goat supplementary payments in less favoured and mountain regions, drying aid for cereals, and direct payments in outermost regions. A decision on additional quotas in the dairy sector was deferred as was decoupling pending the full implementation of dairy sector reform. A decision on the <b>compromise</b> <b>text</b> was deferred to allow member states more time to reflect. Comment: The decision to defer decoupling in the dairy sector until reform is completed, gives a clear indication that for other sectors such as sugar, substantial reform involving price reductions and increased product-specific direct aid payments will have to precede the incorporation of the sector into the single decoupled farm aid payments scheme.

40|$|The USDA GAINS {{briefing}} of 26 th June 2003 {{provides a}} simplified {{analysis of the}} final CAP reform agreement. It describes the final agreement as 'highly complex' and maintains that it 'represents a significant watering down of the original Commission proposals, with: the possibility of delaying decoupling until 2007; the scrapping of price cuts in the cereals sector; the maintenance of coupled payments in some sectors; limited cuts in the dairy sector compared to the Commission's initial proposals. The briefing {{points out that the}} <b>compromise</b> <b>text</b> states that the EU 'will not pay twice in order to conclude the round', implying that the EU does not intend to make any further concession beyond those already agreed as part of the reform of the CAP, {{in the context of the}} Doha Development Round. In its analysis of the reforms agreed the USDA sees decoupling taking place at three levels: payments that will not be decoupled at all; payments that will be partially decoupled and payments that will be decoupled later, with member states being left to choose whether or not to fully decouple. The USA has called on the EU to translate the reform package into new and ambitious negotiating proposals at the WTO. The Chair of the WTO General Council, Carlos Perez del Castillo, described the reforms as 'a step in the right direction', while Australian Agriculture Minister, Mark Vaile, welcomed the move as a positive step. Development NGOs, however, criticised the final CAP-reform agreement as 'half-hearted and not going far enough to curb overproduction in Europe or to halt dumping of agricultural products on developing countries'. This is based on the fact that the final agreement still maintains 'a limited link between subsidy and production under defined conditions so as to avoid the abandonment of production' and the fact that EU agricultural support will not decrease significantly. Rather the reforms will allow the subsidies to be shifted into the 'green box', thereby making them exempt from WTO disciplines. The President of CIAA, the organisation of the European food and drink industry, described the CAP agreement as being in line with the long-term goals of the food-and-drink sector. Comment: The actual negotiating capital which the EU earns in the WTO from the compromise agreement will be determined by the perceptions of the EU's trading partners as to the impact of the reform measures in specific sectors of concern to them. Given the complexity of the final reform package many of the EU's negotiating partners are reserving judgement until they have had time to work out the likely external market impact of the proposed reform measures.

40|$|The recent {{war against}} Iraq was {{strategically}} explained and morally justified {{as a necessary}} preemption to save America from terrorist attacks using {{weapons of mass destruction}} (WMD). Unilateral military interventions, sometimes preventive, sometimes retaliatory, but mostly short, played a part in American foreign policy throughout the 1990 s, with right-wing US politicians putting pressure on the government to intervene against Saddam Hussein for a number of years. Thus, the war did not come out of the blue. What was new was the elevation of preemptive strikes to a military doctrine by a presidential document, the National Security Strategy (NSS), which presented preemptive strikes as a regular future instrument for the American military in an ongoing and long lasting “war against terror”. Although embellished with Wilsonian language on the promotion of democracy and human rights, this document defines military power as the primary tool of US foreign policy which will ultimately, under American leadership, introduce democratic reforms in the Greater Middle East and elsewhere. The diplomatic prelude to the first application in Iraq in the United Nations Security Council led to a <b>compromise</b> <b>text</b> in November 2002 that was based on open dissent on “automaticity” (for America to go to war should she judge Iraqi compliance to be insufficient); later in February/March 2003 a proposed second resolution was openly defeated in spite of extraordinary American pressure; a promising last minute proposal was rejected by the US. The bitterness of transatlantic and intra-European divisions is without precedent. All partners were affected by it. In Germany, foreign policy consensus fell apart and its cushioned situation in a benign hegemonial system ended. Britain’s customary eagerness to please the US in security affairs paid off badly. The problems of European Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) were laid open. They will remain unresolved, and will prohibit serious European actions in real crises, until there is a radical change of the international situation, be it an American return to isolationism versus Europe, a change in the British basic orientation, or the emergence of security priorities which force all European partners to make sacrifices in sovereignty and resources. If nothing like this happens, the Europeans will continue to paper over their CFSP problems.

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 This {{thesis is}} an {{exploration}} of literary representation of professors, specificially in Willa Cather's The Professor's House and Vladimir Nabokov's Pnin.

I argue that in The Professor's House, Godfrey St. Peter's desire to evacuate the content of his historical research of violence by writing his memories and domestic experiences into the <b>text</b> <b>compromises</b> his connection to the ground-level history he attempts to write. Only {{the end of the novel}} and its violent domestic event can prompt him to seek interaction with the outside "world of Augustas.

40|$|AbstractText {{messaging}} {{while driving}} is considered dangerous and known to produce injuries and fatalities. However, {{the effects of}} text messaging on driving performance have not been synthesized or summarily estimated. All available experimental studies that measured the effects of text messaging on driving were identified through database searches using variants of “driving” and “texting” without restriction on year of publication through March 2014. Of the 1476 abstracts reviewed, 82 met general inclusion criteria. Of these, 28 studies were found to sufficiently compare reading or typing text messages while driving with a control or baseline condition. Independent variables (text-messaging tasks) were coded as typing, reading, {{or a combination of}} both. Dependent variables included eye movements, stimulus detection, reaction time, collisions, lane positioning, speed and headway. Statistics were extracted from studies to compute effect sizes (rc). A total sample of 977 participants from 28 experimental studies yielded 234 effect size estimates of the relationships among independent and dependent variables. Typing and reading text messages while driving adversely affected eye movements, stimulus detection, reaction time, collisions, lane positioning, speed and headway. Typing text messages alone produced similar decrements as typing and reading, whereas reading alone had smaller decrements over fewer dependent variables. Typing and reading text messages affects drivers’ capability to adequately direct attention to the roadway, respond to important traffic events, control a vehicle within a lane and maintain speed and headway. This meta-analysis provides convergent evidence that <b>texting</b> <b>compromises</b> the safety of the driver, passengers and other road users. Combined efforts, including legislation, enforcement, blocking technologies, parent modeling, social media, social norms and education, will be required to prevent continued deaths and injuries from texting and driving...|$|R
40|$|The {{publication}} of the thitherto unavailable original scroll of On the Road in 2007 marked a decisive point for Beat scholarship. Enabling line-by-line comparison, the two versions could suddenly be placed under proper scrutiny, and Kerouac’s revisions set up against the established myth of the novel’s creation. How should we understand the revisions? To supply a contribution to an answer, this paper will map the artistic as well as personal trajectory of Jack Kerouac throughout the 1950 s. Basing my analysis largely on correspondence, I will show how Kerouac constantly oscillated between different positions and attitudes within the space of literary production. The essay will argue that Kerouac’s pursuit of literary prestige, stood {{side by side with}} the always-present alternative of satisfying the demands of the large audience. If we add to this Kerouac’s obsession with his imagined audience it becomes clear that his final work resulted from more than his own aesthetic preferences. Devoting a section to his aesthetic program, I will explore to what extent editorial revisions, even seemingly minor ones, <b>compromised</b> his original <b>text</b> in significant ways. Keeping in mind his erratic trajectory, and adding to it Warren French’s complementary observation that Kerouac’s personality was violently split, will allow us to identify an equally contradictory literary self-expression. Thus comparing On the Road with Visions of Cody (the latter emerged through the revisions of the former), Kerouac’s literary expression can be said to manifest itself in two fundamentally different ways. In Road as a reifying gesture that mystifies man’s connection with the earth, and, in Visions as an opposite gesture of dereification that seeks to disclose the source of man-made products that have become reified. Proposing that the autobiographical component of Kerouac’s writing is essentially a gesture of dereification, the essay will argue that editorial revisions of such works inescapably destabilize the unity between experienced reality and textual representation...|$|R
40|$|From a {{critical}} perspective, this study interrogates issues of representation and relevance among Twitter fans. Sitcoms are a satirical reflection of everyday life. Studying audience response on Twitter can offer {{insight into the}} connection between a television show as a text and its responding fans. There has been a variation in engagement {{when it comes to}} television viewership. Some viewers are no longer passively watching their favorite shows. They are engaged on social media offering comments and questioning what they see and hear. This {{comes at a time when}} television has evolved with a renaissance of programming and technology, but still covets rating success and the ability to cultivate captive audiences. This research applies textual and discourse analysis in an examination of three episodes each from Modern Family and Family Guy while linking direct commentary in response on Twitter. Specifically, representations of masculinity, race/ethnicity, class and sexuality are explored. The findings indicate an active audience that is supportive of both of sitcoms and an extension of their enjoyment beyond the texts themselves into personal, communal and societal experiences. Each text was analyzed based the context of the episode in connection with the discourse of the corresponding tweets. Tweets were singled out based on their context in connection with the defined categories of inquiry; masculinity, race/ethnicity, class and sexuality. The findings indicate that the nature of parody/satire itself prompted cultural exchanges of discourse on Twitter in specific areas of personal, communal and societal relevance. More specifically, personal relevance meant an intimate connection between the person tweeting about the text and the context of the text itself. Communal was more about shared experiences between members of the Twitter fandom and societal was defined by projected comments beyond the isolated nature of the shared community on Twitter. The result is a negotiation of audience members with the text as it unfolds in front of them. There is a range of commentary from acceptance to disgust. This study reveals the rich data that is available in response to popular sitcoms. It investigates how an audience negotiates and rationalizes hegemonic forces at work alongside progressive modes of representation. The result is not a monolithic response to the text. Instead, this work revealed a more complex level of responses given the polysemic nature of the audience (Fiske, 2010). Negotiation works as a constant cyclical process between the producers, the text itself and the audience’s interpretation. Popular sitcoms like Modern Family and Family Guy were shown in this study to exist upon an important base of fan support because of the predictability of the existing narratives. Whether audience members chose to love, hate or <b>compromise</b> for each <b>text,</b> as demonstrated by their tweets, there was active participation including their choice in viewership and activity on Twitter. Participation occurred at multiple levels. First, their choice to view the text in the first place. Second, their negotiation concerning how to engage with the text, and third, their resulting reaction to the text on Twitter. This study examines that participatory experience during the spring 2013 television season. This in-depth analysis found that over a 24 hour period the tweets surrounding each episode included personal, communal and societal relevance for Twitter fans, especially when it came to issues of masculinity, race/ethnicity, sexuality, and class...|$|R
