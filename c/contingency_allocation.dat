40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop an analytical method for quantification of uncertainty in building projects and thereby deciding the <b>contingency</b> <b>allocation</b> based on probability of success. The factors {{that give rise to}} uncertainty in Bill of Quantities (BOQ) type of building contracts are discussed. The uncertainty of input items to a Bill of Quantities, namely, quantities of bill items usages of resources in building schedule of rates (BSR) and their basic prices are quantified as two moments using subjective probabilities. From these, expected value and standard deviation of project cost are evaluated. The <b>contingency</b> <b>allocation</b> is decided based on the desired probability of success and the total allocation for the whole project is distributed among individual BOQ items. Finally it is discussed how the project manager can monitor the depletion of allocated contingency and exercise a management control over the total project cost and over individual BOQ items. A computer program is designed to automate the whole process of <b>contingency</b> <b>allocation...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{cross-country}} pipeline {{construction project}} {{is exposed to}} an uncertain environment due to its enormous size (physical, manpower requirement and financial value), complexity in design technology and involvement of external factors. These uncertainties can lead to several changes in project scope {{during the process of}} project execution. Unless the changes are properly controlled, the time, cost and quality goals of the project may never be achieved. A methodology is proposed for project control through risk analysis, <b>contingency</b> <b>allocation</b> and hierarchical planning models. Risk analysis is carried out through the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) due to the subjective nature of risks in construction projects. The results of risk analysis are used to determine the logical contingency for project control with the application of probability theory. Ultimate project control is carried out by hierarchical planning model which enables decision makers to take vital decisions during the changing environment of the construction period. Goal programming (GP), a multiple criteria decision-making technique, is proposed for model formulation because of its flexibility and priority-base structure. The project is planned hierarchically in three levelsâ€”project, work package and activity. GP is applied separately at each level. Decision variables of each model are different planning parameters of the project. In this study, models are formulated from the owner's perspective and its effectiveness in project control is demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Cost overrun in any sector brings bad {{image to}} the {{organization}} and unrest to the professionals. The cost overrun can be resulted either due to risk events or non risk events. Possible non risk events in bridge projects are the scope changes, design changes, quantity increase and variations. However those non risk events produce a justification to the additional cost incurred and it enhance {{the value of the}} project adding more properties. On the other hand risk events take place unexpectedly and it wastes the project money and degrades the value of the project. Therefore in order to absorb this risk cost, without making any burden to the project, conventionally it is practicing to allocate contingency budget. However still the most road and bridge contracts do not meet set cost targets as a result of improper assessment of risk factors inherent in construction. The majority of time and cost overruns are attributable to either unforeseen or foreseen events for which uncertainties were not properly accommodated. The Sri Lankan practice is to add a 10 % contingency sum in bill quantities to cover the risks or uncertainties. However, even with the presence of this <b>contingency</b> <b>allocation,</b> cost overruns still prevail in the industry. Identification of the root causes for the contingency budget overrun and presenting preventive strategies for the small bridge contracts cover the research topic...|$|E
40|$|Recent, {{unprecedented}} {{increases in}} wind penetration pose new challenges to maintaining good control performance in power systems. The stochastic nature of wind power creates {{an incentive to}} treat control resources as stochastic. This work presents a stochastic, time-dependent model of contingency reserve (CR) activation {{that is based on}} system behavior expected by the NERC and WECC disturbance control performance standards. The model quantifies CR activation as a statistical combination of probability density functions (PDFs) that represent CR response deficiencies and generation outage probabilities. This work also formulates an algorithm for determining the CR response deficiency PDFs in real time from observed energy management system data. The proposed model has multiple applications such as a deterministic or stochastic unit commitment, system adequacy evaluation, contingency reserve margins, and <b>contingency</b> reserve <b>allocation...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} {{deals with}} {{aspects of the}} consultation with experts in risk management of projects. A problem of the consultation with internal and external experts is {{the influence of the}} personality, of personal interests and the mutual influence with regard to the evaluation of risks, as well as the individual attitude towards the project and towards the risks in general. The solution of this problem is very important, because estimated probability of risks and expected consequences may entail cost-intensive measures, such as <b>contingency</b> reserve <b>allocations</b> and risk networks. If risks are evaluated inaccurately, crisis management or project cancellation may be the only options left. The article starts with an overview of the particular problems of risk management. The authors continue by presenting a possible process which uses MCDA to increase objectivity, i. e. to reduce subjective influence on risk evaluation and risk evaluation based on the consultation with experts. The methodical approach allows an application to similar problems for different experts and decision-makers...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a study examining the potential of in-situ propellant production (ISPP) on Mars to aid in achieving a low cost Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission. Two versions of such a mission were examined: a baseline version employing a dual string spacecraft, and a light weight version employing single string architecture with selective redundancy. Both systems employed light weight avionics currently being developed by Lockheed Martin, Jet Propulsion Lab and elsewhere in the aerospace community, both used a new concept for a simple, light weight parachuteless sample return capsule, both used a slightly modified version of the Mars Surveyor lander currently under development at Lockheed Martin for flight in 1998, and both used a combination of the Sabatier-electrolysis and reverse water gas shift ISPP systems to produce methane/oxygen propellant on Mars by combining a small quantity of imported hydrogen with the Martian CO 2 atmosphere. It was found that the baseline mission could be launched on a Delta 7925 and return a 0. 5 kg sample with 82 percent mission launch margin;over and beyond subsystem allocated contingency masses. The lightweight version could be launched on a Mid-Lite vehicle and return a 0. 25 kg sample with 11 percent launch margin, over and above subsystem <b>contingency</b> mass <b>allocations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Determining a fair {{margin of}} risk that forms {{a part of}} mark-up in a bid is a crucial issue when pricing bill of {{quantities}} at a tender. The results indicates that risk is not adequately priced by almost all the local contracting firms but they often use experience, intuition, rule of thumb or guesswork. However, in the present day context of competitive business environment, it is time a new emphasis placed on identifying and assessing risk factor as precise as possible. Hence, the thesis is aimed to examine closely and objectively the risk factor involved in pricing construction projects and to propose a way of assigning a monetary value to the risk factor so as {{to arrive at a}} reasonable margin of risk and a contingency sum. At this exercise, various risk management techniques such as risk premium, sensitivity testing, monte-carlo simulation, utility theory, risk adjusted discount rate and expected monetary value etc have been commentated including their relative merits, demerits and practical limitations. Further, the contractual provisions as to apportionment of risk in tender and contract documents have also been discussed with special emphasis on ICTAD Conditions of Contract Revised in January 1989, conditions by which most of local building contract are governed. A statistical approach, one that is already developed, to decide on the sum of <b>contingency</b> <b>allocation</b> supported with a worked example extracted from building schedule' of rates is also suggested for the quantity surveyors to adopt in their pre-tender pricing exercises. The research concludes with a proposal of guidelines and recommendations on how to cope with the risk factor. It is the author's belief that these guidelines will benefit both construction contracting and consultancy firms...|$|E
40|$|Background: Project {{and program}} budget {{estimation}} and execution within the estimated budget are critical functions in any organization, in particular those dealing with fixed cost contracts. During planning, the functional organization estimates the baseline cost and schedule {{by considering the}} project {{as a number of}} interacting tasks and rolling up resource estimates for completing these tasks and the senior management allocate contingency or management reserve to account for project risks. During execution, project organization measures the project performance against the baseline cost and schedule to prevent cost overruns. One of the methods for monitoring project performance is the Earned Value Management (EVM) methodology which uses conceptually simple parameters like Cost Performance Index (CPI) and Schedule Performance Index (SPI) to monitor and articulate project performance and to compute estimated cost at completion (EAC). Motivation: The budgeting approach as outlined above does not explicitly account for emerging project uncertainties and as a result contingency allocated by the organization at the planning stage may not be sufficient, as the allocation is based on prior experience and does not take the impact of the emerging risk on the project into account. During planning differences in perceptions of risks with regards to requirements, work scope, maturity of technology, engineering effort and organizational capacity introduce uncertainties. (cont.) During execution, uncertainties emanate from emerging risks, utilization of past performance to predict EAC and assignment of "earned value" to partially completed tasks. Accounting for these uncertainties could result {{in a wide range of}} valid EAC values each associated with a unique likelihood (probability or confidence level). From a project risk management perspective, establishing and constantly monitoring this 'likelihood' value will help organizations to accurately measure performance and proactively implement risk mitigation strategies to keep the project in check and to clearly articulate project performance status across the organization. Approach: This thesis extends EVM for incorporating uncertainties and establishing parameters for articulating project performance in a systematic manner. During project planning "Risk Elicited Earned Value Management Procedure" systematically captures embedded costing assumptions and quantifies the impact of task level uncertainties to determine the likelihood of a project meeting the baseline cost using Monte Carlo methodology; such risk quantification will help organizations in <b>contingency</b> <b>allocation</b> for addressing known risks and unknown risks. In this thesis, total contingency amount will be split into two parts - hard and soft values. The hard management reserve (HMR) allocated by the senior management is primarily for addressing known risks and soft management reserve (SMR) is primarily for addressing any unknown risks that typically emerges during the course of project execution. (cont.) The senior management would also like to challenge the organization to improve its performance by not completely funding the project but would like to know its impact on the likelihood so as to prevent unduly burdening the organization. During execution, the same risk elicitation procedure can be used to estimate the likelihood that a project meets the EAC calculated by EVM and in addition, establish what it would take to meet the challenge imposed by the management. Additional emerging risks and refinement in risk mitigation strategies can be incorporated to improve the confidence level on the estimated likelihood. In essence, the new procedure provides a systematic framework for deliberations between functional and project organizations in developing a robust risk management strategy and the likelihood can be used to articulate project status to senior management. Results: The case studies indicated that the risk elicited approach yields additional parameters that would allow the organization to evaluate the impact of the underlying risk profile and project performance on cost and schedule and help establish confidence levels on the estimated cost and schedule. The approach also helps benchmark organizational performance against management expectations. Conclusions: The systematic risk elicitation approach outlined in this thesis improves the process of project cost estimation and project execution by making the process more transparent and instilling accountability across the organization. (cont.) This transparency ensures that the entire organization - functional, project and senior management have the same understanding about costing methodology. The process establishes confidence levels on the estimated cost and schedule at completion which were not available to the organization previously. This additional information will help the organization with prioritizing risks, securing allocation of adequate funding and contingency amounts and assuring the senior management that the organization is not unduly challenged minimizing employee frustration and burn-out. The framework provides a quantitative means to compare the effect of emerging risks and mitigation plans on project performance. The case studies also demonstrated that the approach has the ability to indicate problems even at the project planning stage by establishing confidence levels that can be used to evaluate robustness of project costing and articulate status of the project during its execution in an objective manner. by Parthasarathy Seshadri.

40|$|There {{has been}} a notable {{evolution}} in immigration over the last ten years, with obvious effects on the education system. This increase, mainly concentrated in the public sector, {{has been a}} serious challenge for the administration and schools. Despite efforts made {{in the design of}} policies, <b>contingency</b> plans and <b>allocation</b> of resources, the results can still be improved. In Catalonia, after an observation period, the emphasis has been placed on organising the various levels of administration to carry out an efficient intervention. In practice, regarding foreign students, this has meant adopting compensatory policies focused on social cohesion and multiculturalism. This article is a review of educational policies in Catalonia, with a specific analysis of the multicultural practices applied to education in a primary school.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{contention}} from {{the general public and}} the press on the misuse and mismanagement of public funds notwithstanding the work done by the internal auditing in LGAs coupled with the government efforts to ensure proper utilization of public funds. This study was conducted in order to meet three specific objectives, namely; to understand the mechanism used by LGAs in auditing activities, to examine the performance of current internal auditing in LGAs, and to investigate on the challenges which face internal audit unit in LGAs. The study was adopted a case study methodology by taking Dodoma Municipal Council(DMC) as a case. Data was collected using a questionnaire and interview from employees and the top management, as well as documentary review. Further, data was analysed using both quantitative and qualitative techniques. It has been found out that the mechanism used by LGAs in auditing activities is somehow effective. Moreover, it was uncovered that performance of internal Audit in LGAs is good as shown by using various indicators from the study. Additionally, it has been discovered that DMC is strong in its internal environment due to the existence of amongst the friendly collaboration between auditors and those audited. Finally, the study discovered that LGAs face mainly four challenges in discharging its duties regarding internal auditing. From the study, the government was advised to restrain politicians from interfering with the internal auditorsâ€™ decisions together with considering <b>contingency</b> fund <b>allocation</b> to development projects. Finally, LGAs were advised to introduce programmed trainings to internal auditors for making value for money audit effective. ...|$|R
40|$|Mechanisms of {{selective}} attention {{are essential for}} prioritising behaviourally relevant sensory inputs and suppressing irrelevant ones. In an attention task, participants follow an experimenterâ€™s instructions to prioritise one stimulus type over another. However, priority can also be established by having participants associate a subset of stimuli with an inherent value, based on contingencies of reward or punishment. The aim of the present thesis was to tease apart the roles of instructions and value <b>contingencies</b> in the <b>allocation</b> of attention to subsets of coloured stimuli in dynamic visual arrays. Participants manoeuvred a cursor to approach or avoid moving objects of one colour (targets; low-, medium- or high-value) while ignoring objects of another colour (neutral distractors). Target and distractor stimuli flickered at unique frequencies, and electroencephalography (EEG) was used to capture frequency tagged neural responses to these concurrent stimuli. Participants either maximized contact with rewarded objects for monetary gain (Experiment 1; N = 24) or minimized contact with punished objects to avoid monetary loss (Experiment 2; N = 24). In Experiment 1, behavioural and EEG results indicated that approach behaviour {{was influenced by the}} behavioural goal to track one subset of items, independent of the relative or absolute reward value on any given trial. The results of Experiment 2 yielded a more complex outcome. There was no reliable effect of relative or absolute punishment value on avoidance behaviour. There was, however, a small but definitive effect of absolute punishment value (but not relative value) on neural activity. A comparison of results across the two experiments indicated neural enhancement of rewarded objects over punished objects, and an effect of absolute value across approach and avoidance tasks. The results suggest that in the context of attentional tracking, approach behaviour is determined by behavioural goals rather than rewards and punishments, whereas avoidance behaviour may be influenced by both factors...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community at author's request from Jan. 4, 2013 - July 4, 2013 It {{has been suggested that}} projects in the construction industry are subject to risks more than other industries. However, there is often little parity in allocation of risks in the construction industry. Usually, project participants allocate risks by aversion where owners tend to shift risks to the primary contractor, who in turn transfers them to the subcontractors. As a result of this, risks are not necessarily allocated/ re-allocated to the party that is best able to manage them efficiently and effectively. Risk allocation can significantly influence the behavior of the project participants and hence affects project schedule, cost and performance. Inappropriate risk allocation has led to adversarial relationships between contracting participants and has consequently increased project cost. The objective of this dissertation is to shed light on the current practices of risk allocation in the construction industry. The dissertation consists of three sections. The first section investigates and evaluates the problems of the current practice of risks allocation and their impacts on project performance. The second section investigates, identifies, and classifies barriers to optimal risk allocation. The third section looks into allocating construction risk from a more cooperative and rational perspective. The goal is to provide the construction industry with a rational decision-making mechanism that will provide an alternative to the current practice of typically allocating risks by aversion. To meet the objectives, structured survey questionnaires for Sections One and Two were used. The first survey found that the current practice of risk allocation has four major problems. These problems include: 1. Dispute, claims and tension leads to adversarial relationships. 2. Competitive relationship leads to aggressive relationships. 3. Subjective pricing of risk leading to higher <b>contingency.</b> 4. <b>Allocation</b> by aversion that leads to misallocation of risks. The second survey found thirteen barriers to optimal risk allocation, which were classified into three main categories: behavioral, technical, and organizational barriers. Lack of an efficient risk allocation mechanism ranks {{at the top of the}} identified barriers. These findings were linked, in causal-effects relationships, to formulate an analytic model for the current practice of risk allocation. This dissertation uses the research findings and the rational decision-making process to develop a practical mechanism for optimizing risk allocation. The developed mechanism was then fine-tuned and validated by a Delphi expert panel technique. The developed mechanism should aid construction industry professionals and construction project participants in making rational and economical risk allocation decisions to alleviate the identified above-mentioned problems, overcome the identified barriers, and improve project efficiency by minimizing the negative impacts of the current practice of risk allocation on project cost, schedule and overall project performance...|$|R
