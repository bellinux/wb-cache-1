5|$|Unlike {{with their}} {{previous}} albums, the group produced Sons of Soul entirely themselves. They utilized both vintage and contemporary recording gear in the album's production, including a Hammond B-3, Clavinet, ARP String Ensemble, and Korg and Roland synthesizers. Riley viewed that hearing music played {{from the older}} instruments affected their songwriting. For his vocals, Raphael recorded with Neumann U87 and AKG C12A <b>condensor</b> microphones, {{as well as a}} vintage RCA Type77-DX microphone. He used a custom five-string bass from a guitar and bass repair shop in San Francisco, as well as a Minimoog analog synthesizer for other bass lines on the album. D'wayne used a Microtech Gefell UM70 for his lead vocals and an AKG 414 for his background vocals. He played a vintage Gibson L6-S and a Fender Coronado guitar, modified with Gibson burst bucker pickups. Aside from his drumming, Riley played both Wurlitzer and Fender Rhodes electric pianos.|$|E

25|$|For {{whatever}} reason, {{the isolation}} <b>condensor</b> {{apparently did not}} work. On 27 February 2012 NISA ordered TEPCO to reveal – before 12 March 2012 – why {{the layout of the}} isolation <b>condensor</b> was changed. In the papers of the original application (dated from July 1966) for reactor 1 the tubes were separated from each other. But in the blueprints submitted in October 1967, the two tubes were connected with each other outside the reactor vessel. TEPCO apparently changed the design without notifying NISA, in violation of legal procedure.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the scheme, water <b>condensors,</b> {{irregular}} rain, {{and water}} trains {{were part of}} the range of sources. Railway dams were essential for water to supply locomotives to travel to the goldfields.|$|R

500|$|In 2011, it was {{discovered}} that rare locomotive parts that were [...] "as good as irreplaceable" [...] had been stolen, and the locomotive was moved to Perambur Locomotive Workshops at Chennai, in Tamil Nadu, for repair. [...] On arrival, it was found that an estimated 50 to 60 parts had been looted, including [...] "the boiler, <b>condensor,</b> lubricator and flow tubes". [...] The Deputy Chief Mechanical Engineer at the workshops stated [...] "What we received is a dead body, a piece of metal whose every removable part has been removed, leaving only the metal shell. The list of parts to be procured is huge." [...] Officials estimated that it could take at least a year to restore the engine, even if suppliers of replacement parts could be found. [...] Following a substantial rebuild, in which the workshops had to construct the missing parts themselves, the locomotive returned to service on 22 December 2012.|$|E
2500|$|The Goshawk was {{developed}} from the Kestrel IV prototype engine, to use evaporative (also known as [...] "steam") cooling. Rather than keep the cooling liquid below its boiling point in the cooling system, the coolant was allowed to boil; the phase change from liquid to vapour takes more heat from the engine, so less coolant is needed. However, instead of a radiator to take {{the heat from the}} coolant, a <b>condensor</b> was required to turn the vapour back to liquid. This had to be much larger than a radiator and added drag to the aircraft design.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the ever}} {{increasing}} orders, in 1872 the company rented a factory on Celler street {{in what is}} now the Oststadt district. It consisted of two small buildings with a 12 horse-power steam engine. It would employ 41 workers. The young enterprise produced injectors and jet-pumps as well as the associated <b>condensors.</b> In 1874 the small factory was already supplying 2,000 devices.|$|R
50|$|Redhill Street in Manchester {{was home}} to two large {{spinning}} companies, A&G Murray Ltd and McConnells. Historically this area of Manchester had used {{the waters of the}} Shooters Brook to power the waterwheels on Salvins Factory and the New Islington Mill. The Rochdale Canal runs alongside the street and the mill. Originally used for transport, the canal had provided water to Murrays and McConnells for the <b>condensors</b> of their steam engines.|$|R
50|$|The {{next phase}} of mills was powered by Boulton and Watt {{double-acting}} beam engines. Though flowing water was no longer required, {{a considerable amount of}} water was needed for the engines' <b>condensors</b> which was provided by a mill lodge, canal or brook. The first Boulton and Watt engine in Manchester was bought by Drinkwater's Mill in Piccadilly in 1789, and installed by the Birmingham company's prizefighting engineer, Isaac Perrins.|$|R
2500|$|Clearly further {{modifications}} {{would be}} needed. It {{was decided to}} delete the radiator and change the cooling to a [...] "total loss" [...] system. The upper fuel tank was removed and replaced with a combined <b>condensor</b> and water tank. The water was fed through the engine {{and back to the}} tank, where as much as possible would be condensed, while the overflow was ejected {{from the base of the}} engine as a jet of steam. It was calculated that the Speed Spitfire would be able to make the speed runs and land safely before the water and much reduced fuel would run out at about the same time.|$|E

50|$|A {{microphone}} is a transducer {{and as such}} is {{the source}} of much of the coloration of an audio mix. Most audio engineers would assert that a microphone preamplifier also affects the sound quality of an audio mix. A preamplifier might load the microphone with low impedance, forcing the microphone to work harder and so change its tone quality. A preamplifier might add coloration by adding a different characteristic than the audio mixer's built-in preamplifiers. Some microphones, for example <b>condensors,</b> must be used in conjunction with an impedance matching preamplifier to function properly.|$|R

50|$|The {{other options}} {{set by the}} NRC are nuclear {{decommissioning}} which is immediate dismantling of the plant and remediation of the site, and nuclear entombment which is the enclosure of contaminated parts of the plant in a permanent layer of concrete. Mixtures of options may be used, for example, immediate removal of steam turbine components and <b>condensors,</b> and SAFSTOR for the more heavily radioactive containment vessel. Since NRC requires decommissioning to be completed within 60 years, ENTOMB is not usually chosen since not all activity will have decayed to an unregulated background level in that time.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{impact of}} swift heavy ions onto silicon oxide and silicon {{oxynitride}} on silicon creates etchable tracks in these insulators. After their etching and {{filling up with}} highly resistive matter, these nanometric pores {{can be used as}} charge extraction or injection paths towards the conducting channel in the underlying silicon. In this way, a novel family of electronic structures has been realized. The basic characteristics of these TEMPOS Tunable Electronic Material with Pores in Oxide on Silicon structures are summarized. Their functionality is determined by the type of insulator, the etch track diameters and lengths, their areal densities, the type of conducting matter embedded therein, and of course by the underlying semiconductor and the contact geometry. Depending on the TEMPOS preparation recipe and working point, the structures may resemble gatable resistors, <b>condensors,</b> diodes, transistors, photocells, or sensors, and they are therefore rather universally applicable in electronics. TEMPOS structures are often sensitive to temperature, light, humidity and organic gases. Also light emitting TEMPOS structures have been produced. About 35 TEMPOS based circuits such as thermosensors, photosensors, humidity and alcohol sensors, amplifiers, frequency multipliers, amplitude modulators, oscillators, flip flops, and many others have already been designed and sucessfully tested. Sometimes TEMPOS based circuits are more compact than conventional electronics...|$|R
