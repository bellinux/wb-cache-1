Although it has a low population density, the average population growth rate of 1.8%, from 2000 to 2010, is very close to the national average of 2.0%. In 2014, 58% of the population resided in urban areas with the remainder in rural areas, but over the next 10 years it is predicted that the urban population would rise to 65%. , the crude birth rate in Sarawak was 16.3 per 1000 individuals, the <b>crude</b> <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> was 4.3 per 1000 population, and the infant mortality rate was 6.5 per 1000 live births.|$|E

The empirical results provide confirmation that while food prices are shown to be positively correlated with infant mortality and <b>crude</b> <b>death</b> <b>rates,</b> they are statistically insignificant. However, the empirical results do provide strong support that rising food prices are strongly associated with falling life expectancy. Other than food price, the results also provide strong evidence that rising incidence of diseases are associated with higher incidence of mortality among children and <b>crude</b> <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> and lower life expectancies.

According to 1982 census data, in rural areas the <b>crude</b> <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> was 1.6 per 1,000 higher than in urban areas, and life expectancy was about 4 years lower. The number of senior physicians per 1,000 population was about 10 times greater in urban areas than in rural ones; state expenditure on medical care was more than -Y26 per capita in urban areas and less than -Y3 per capita in rural areas. There were also about twice as many hospital beds in urban areas as in rural areas.

25|$|After {{hitting a}} {{historical}} low of 1.47 children born per female, the total fertility {{rate of the}} EU started to increase again, to reach a level of 1.60 in 2008. The positive trend was observed in all member states {{with the exception of}} Luxembourg, Malta and Portugal. The largest increases over this period were observed in Bulgaria (from 1.23 children per woman in 2003 to 1.57 in 2009), Slovenia (from 1.20 to 1.53), the Czech Republic (from 1.18 to 1.49) and Lithuania (from 1.26 to 1.55). In 2009, the Member States with the highest fertility rates were Ireland (2.06), France (2.00), Sweden (1.94), and the United Kingdom (1.90), all approaching the replacement level of 2.1 children born per female. The lowest rates were observed in Latvia (1.31), Hungary and Portugal (both 1.32) and Germany (1.36). The increasing fertility rate has also been accompanied by an upward trend in the natural increase of the population which is due to the moderate increase of the crude birth rate that reached 10.9 births per 1000 inhabitants in 2008, an increase of 0.3 compared with 2007. The increase was observed in all member countries except Germany. The EU <b>crude</b> <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> remained stable at 9.7 per 1000 inhabitants. The relatively low fertility rate means retirement age workers are not entirely replaced by younger workers joining the workforce. The EU faces a potential future dominated by an ever-increasing population of retired citizens, without enough younger workers to fund (via taxes) retirement programs or other state welfare agendas.|$|E

40|$|The {{demographic}} transition in the Arab countries of Western Asia in general {{has been somewhat}} peculiar. Total fertility rose substantially before it began its historical decline. Life expectancy rose at a very fast pace. The very high fertility rates, resulted in an extremely youthful populations which, combined with low mortality schedules, resulted in <b>crude</b> <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> (CDRs) of 3 to 4 per thousand population, that is, lower than rates ever achieved in developed and most developing countries. The maximum range between crude birth <b>rates</b> (CBRs) and <b>crude</b> <b>death</b> <b>rates,</b> therefore, reached, in some countries, particularly in the Gulf, the unprecedented levels of 4. 5 to 5 per cent a year. Looking to the near future, as the ageing process advances with the expected fall in fertility, the further gains in life expectancy will be accompanied {{by an increase in}} <b>crude</b> <b>death</b> <b>rates.</b> During the 100 years between 1950 and 2050, the relationship between CBRs and CDRs, therefore, is characterized by four distinct phases. This may be illustrated with data from Jordan. The first phase, from 1950 to 1970, rates of natural increase rose rapidly because of both a rise in CBRs and a fall in CDRs. The second phase, from 1970 to the present, rates of natural increase fell because the fall in CBRs was more substantial than the fall in CDRs. The third phase, which extends from 2000 to 2030, rates of natural increase will continue to fall due solely to the fall in CBRs as CDRs remained constan...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{systematically}} reviewed {{studies of}} mortality following {{release from prison}} and examined possible demographic and methodological factors associated with variation in mortality rates. METHODS: We searched 5 computer-based literature indexes to conduct a systematic review of studies that reported all-cause, drug-related, suicide, and homicide deaths of released prisoners. We extracted and meta-analyzed <b>crude</b> <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> and standardized mortality ratios by age, gender, and race/ethnicity, where reported. RESULTS: Eighteen cohorts met review criteria reporting 26, 163 deaths with substantial heterogeneity in <b>rates.</b> The all-cause <b>crude</b> <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> ranged from 720 to 2054 per 100, 000 person-years. Male all-cause standardized mortality ratios ranged from 1. 0 to 9. 4 and female standardized mortality ratios from 2. 6 to 41. 3. There were higher standardized mortality ratios in White, female, and younger prisoners. CONCLUSIONS: Released prisoners {{are at increased risk}} for death following release from prison, particularly in the early period. Aftercare planning for released prisoners could potentially have a large public health impact, and further work is needed to determine whether certain groups should be targeted as part of strategies to reduce mortality...|$|R
