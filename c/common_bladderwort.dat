2500|$|All Utricularia are {{carnivorous}} {{and capture}} small organisms {{by means of}} bladder-like traps. Terrestrial species tend to have tiny traps that feed on minute prey such as protozoa and rotifers swimming in water-saturated soil. The traps can {{range in size from}} 0.2mm to 1.2cm. Aquatic species, such as U.vulgaris (<b>common</b> <b>bladderwort),</b> possess bladders that are usually larger and can feed on more substantial prey such as water fleas (Daphnia), nematodes and even fish fry, mosquito larvae and young tadpoles. Despite their small size, the traps are extremely sophisticated. In the active traps of the aquatic species, prey brush against trigger hairs connected to the trapdoor. The bladder, when [...] "set", is under negative pressure in relation to its environment so that when the trapdoor is mechanically triggered, the prey, along with the water surrounding it, is sucked into the bladder. Once the bladder is full of water, the door closes again, the whole process taking only ten to fifteen thousandths of a second.|$|E
50|$|Utricularia macrorhiza, the <b>common</b> <b>bladderwort,</b> is a large, {{perennial}} suspended aquatic {{carnivorous plant}} {{that belongs to}} the genus Utricularia. U. macrorhiza is native to North America and eastern temperate Asia.|$|E
50|$|The {{damselfly}} shelters {{among various}} plants and algaes in its habitat, including green algae, yellow water lily, hydrilla, lizard's tail, pickerelweed, common cattail, upright sedge, <b>common</b> <b>bladderwort,</b> common duckweed, black willow, orange jewelweed, spotted Joe-pye weed, poison ivy, wild grape, sassafras, common greenbrier, and buttonbush.|$|E
50|$|Aquatic plants {{thriving}} {{in the shallow}} lake include <b>bladderwort,</b> <b>common</b> club-rush, and water lilies. The quagmire bordering the lake, dominated by peat moss and reed, also include sedges, marsh willowherb, common marsh bedstraw, mare's tail, gypsywort, bog-myrtle, white water-lily, milk parsley, broad-leaved pondweed, marsh cinquefoil, grey sallow, common club-rush, bur-reed, narrow leaf cattail, and broadleaf cattail.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, a {{wide range}} of aquatic plants were {{documented}} in the lake: reed, common club-rush, common bulrush, lesser bulrush, yellow iris, alisma, branched bur-reed, water hemlock, marsh calla, water-soldier, yellow water-lily, white water-lily, broad-leaved pondweed, blunt-leaved pondweed, whorled water-milfoil, rigid hornwort, <b>common</b> <b>bladderwort,</b> pondweed, bog-bean, frogbit, lesser duckweed, greater duckweed, and ivy-leaved duckweed.|$|E
50|$|The flora in {{the lake}} itself is reduced to a few species, {{including}} White Waterlily, <b>Common</b> <b>Bladderwort,</b> and Whorled Water-Milfoil; while others plants are found along the beaches, including Narrow Leaf Cattail, Slender Tufted-sedge, Greater Pond-sedge, Marsh Cinquefoil, Gypsywort, Yellow loosestrife, Purple Loosestrife, and Corn Mint. An isolated biotope of Greater Spearwort is found on {{the southern end of}} the lake. Among surrounding trees and bushes can be found Black Alder, Buckthorn, Grey Willow, and Bay Willow.|$|E
50|$|Utricularia vulgaris (greater {{bladderwort}} or <b>common</b> <b>bladderwort)</b> is an aquatic {{species of}} bladderwort found in Asia and Europe. The plant is a free-floating {{and does not}} put down roots. Stems can attain lengths of over one metre in a single growing season, but die back and form turions in winter. The leaves are finely pinnately divided, between one and eight centimetres long and carry many bladder-like traps. The yellow flowers are borne on stalks above {{the surface of the}} water between April and August. In eastern Asia and North America, its place is taken by the related species U. macrorhiza.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shores of}} the lake contain {{individual}} willow trees and riparian forests, mostly composed of various species of Populus. Plants include common reed (Phragmites australis), lesser Indian reed mace (Typha angustata [...] ) and several species of cane - Schoenoplectus littoralis, S. lacustris and endemic S. kasachstanicus. Under water grow two types of Myriophyllum - spiked (M. spicatum) and whorled (M. verticillatum); several kinds of Potamogeton - shining (P. lucens), perfoliate (P. perfoliatus), kinky (P. crispus), fennel (P. pectinatus) and P. macrocarpus; as well as <b>common</b> <b>bladderwort</b> (Utricularia vulgaris), rigid hornwort (Ceratophyllum demersum) and two species of Najas. Phytoplankton, the concentration of which was 1.127 g/L in 1985, is represented by numerous species of algae.|$|E
