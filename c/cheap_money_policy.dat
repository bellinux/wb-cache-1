50|$|Edward Hugh John Neale Dalton, Baron Dalton PC (16 August 1887 - 13 February 1962) was a British Labour Party {{economist}} and politician {{who served as}} Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1945 to 1947. He shaped Labour Party foreign-policy in the 1930s, opposed pacifism, promoted rearmament against the German threat, and strongly opposed the appeasement policy of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in 1938. He served in Churchill's wartime coalition cabinet. As Chancellor, he pushed his <b>cheap</b> <b>money</b> <b>policy</b> too hard, and mishandled the sterling crisis of 1947. Dalton's political position was already in jeopardy in 1947, when, he, seemingly inadvertently, revealed a sentence of the budget to a reporter minutes before delivering his budget speech. Prime Minister Clement Attlee accepted his resignation, but he later returned to the cabinet in relatively minor positions.|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} goal for Dalton in 1945-47 was cheaper money—that is, low interest rates. He {{wanted to avoid}} the high interest rates and unemployment experienced after the First World War and to keep down the cost of nationalization.

40|$|Financial sector {{innovation}} and {{development has been}} {{an integral part of}} the rise of capitalism over the last half millennium. The innovations of the last three decades of the twentieth century were a continuation of the trend; they contributed to an era of global prosperity, but also increased the probability of bank failures as bankers and policymakers inexperienced in the new instruments made mistaken decisions. The likelihood of crises was increased by public policies which increased moral hazard. Governments regulate the financial sector due to asymmetric information between depositors and deposit-taking institutions; restricting entry or the lending activity of financial institutions is inefficient, so the weight is now placed on deposit insurance with moral hazard consequences. The policy challenge is to reduce moral hazard without repressing the financial sector and creating adverse selection in lending practices. Since the mid- 1980 s <b>cheap</b> <b>money</b> <b>policies</b> have exacerbated moral hazard associated with inadequate financial sector regulation by encouraging highly leveraged investments. The post- 2007 financial crisis was one of many crises with idiosyncratic catalysts but with common underlying causes: <b>cheap</b> <b>money</b> available to participants in the integrated but imperfectly regulated global financial market eventually led to loan defaults and bank failures. This is not the end of capitalism, but a reminder of the difficult balancing acts involved in policing the financial sector which is at the heart of capitalist economies. financial development; Moral hazard...|$|R

40|$|As policymakers {{confront the}} ongoing U. S. {{financial}} crisis, {{it is important}} {{to take a step back}} and understand its origins. Those who fault "deregulation," "unfettered capitalism," or "greed" would do well to look instead at flawed institutions and misguided policies. The expansion in risky mortgages to underqualified borrowers was encouraged by the federal government. The growth of "creative" nonprime lending followed Congress's strengthening of the Community Reinvestment Act, the Federal Housing Administration's loosening of down-payment standards, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development's pressuring lenders to extend mortgages to borrowers who previously would not have qualified. Meanwhile, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae grew to own or guarantee about half of the United States' $ 12 trillion mortgage market. Congressional leaders pointedly refused to moderate the moral hazard problem of implicit guarantees or otherwise rein in their hyperexpansion, instead pushing them to promote "affordable housing" through expanded purchases of nonprime loans to low income applicants. The credit that fueled these risky mortgages was provided by the <b>cheap</b> <b>money</b> <b>policy</b> of the Federal Reserve. Following the 2001 recession, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan slashed the federal funds rate from 6. 25 to 1. 75 percent. It was reduced further in 2002 and 2003, reaching a record low of 1 percent in mid- 2003 - where it stayed for a year. This set off what economist Steve Hanke called "the mother of all liquidity cycles and yet another massive demand bubble. " The actual causes of our financial troubles were unusual monetary policy moves and novel federal regulatory interventions. These poorly chosen policies distorted interest rates and asset prices, diverted loanable funds into the wrong investments, and twisted normally robust financial institutions into unsustainable positions...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to compare and examine the {{following}} three books focusing our attention on the process of the formation of bubbles: Giichi Miyazaki, The Compound Depression, 1992 : Yukio Noguchi, Economics of Bubbles, 1992 : Yoshio Suzuki, Monetary Policy in Japan, 1993. Miyazaki deems the first phase of bubble formation to be 1983 - 87 and the second to be 1988 - 89. His subjective intention is to explain bubbles through deregulation of finance. Yet objectively, his analysis emphasizes firstly, the Bank's intervention (increase of money supply) after the Plaza agreement, and secondly, MOF's preferential treatments on taxation to firms. His biggest problem is the ambiguity in his basis of the above phase-division, which affects his wlole discussion. Noguchi regards the latter half of 1980 's as the bubble period. He points out, first of all, the prosperity of so-called equity finance and zaiteku (technology of finance) as formative factors. Secondly, above all, he refers to the prolonged cheap money. Nevertheless he isn't successful in explaining why bubbles began to swell from the year 1986. Suzuki deems the years 1988 - 89 to be the bubble period. He argues that it is the long-maintainded <b>cheap</b> <b>money</b> <b>policy,</b> which later proved to be an over-reaction to the Black Monday in Oct. 1987, that brought about bubbles. His arguments are clear, but seem to part from the reality. He excludes the years 1986 - 87 from the bubble period, as to neglect the extravagant inflow of short-term foreign money and the Bank's intervention above. To conclude, it is very important to clarify to the utmost extent when bubbles began to swell. This prescribes one's analysis of bubbles. We regard 1983 - 85 as the early phase of formation and 1986 - 89 as that of fuller-scale. Furthermore the possibility of watered fundamentals as well as the exorbitant short-term capital inflow during 1986 - 87 (and its relation to bubbles) should not be overlooked...|$|E
40|$|How does {{a central}} bank respond when the political, {{economic}} and institutional preconditions underlying its authority and autonomy fundamentally change? When its role traditionally has been characterized by independence from the political authorities and the monetary policy {{has been based on}} flexible interest rates, situated in an international setting of free capital movements, what happens when the international payment system breaks down, the political and economic climate changes, and the general public cries for stronger political control not only of the central bank but of the economy in general – what does the central bank do? Contrary to what it may seem, the above questions are not generated from a future scenario for today’s ideal of central bank independence. Instead, they are based on a specific historical experience: the shift from central bank independence towards increased political control that took place after the breakdown of the Gold Standard system and the economic crises of the 1920 s and 30 s. Starting from curiosity as to why these changes took place and how one central bank – the Bank of Norway (BoN) – faced the new emerging ideals of increased political planning and control, this research project seeks to discuss how and why the Norwegian central bank found a new role after World War II. Inspired by the theoretical concepts of “boundary organizations”, which interprets central banks as agencies operating in the boundary between state, society and economy, and “embedded statism”, which brings focus to the international context in which national institutional changes take place, this thesis carries out an in-depth empirical examination of the extent and nature of the BoN’s participation in policy formulation and implementation from 1945 - 1954. The examination uncovers complex and partly conflicting responses from the central bank to the new expectations in its environment, shifting between opposition and compromise towards the political authorities, whereas the political authorities, for their part, also took a partly contradictory approach by, on the one hand, seeking to downgrade the central bank and, on the other, allowing it to influence policy-making. Contrasting the conventional view {{on the role of the}} BoN, this thesis suggests that the Bank obtained a more active and influential role than usually assumed and that the main elements of the its new autonomy and authority were clarified already during the first post-war decade. Rather than being reduced to a “cashier’s office” or directorate under the Ministry of Finance or replaced by the Banking Inspectorate as co-executor of monetary policy, the BoN survived as an autonomous legal entity and was reestablished as the main co-executor of monetary policy. Moreover, through a process of trial and error, the central bank governor, Gunnar Jahn, and his officials helped define the future policy instruments, both in terms of their nature (voluntary cooperation rather than statutory provisions) and the limitations of the BoN’s influence (the <b>cheap</b> <b>money</b> <b>policy</b> as an underlying precondition). The two main explanatory factors in this development appear to have been the ability of the BoN to participate in practical policy-making and the international context, which indirectly and directly influenced the Norwegian process...|$|E

40|$|There will be {{no great}} opposition, among Japanese people, to the {{assertion}} {{that the problem of}} non-performing debt was the most important inducement to the present serious depression in Japan. The non-performing debt problem was brought about by the huge swell of the bubble in the later 1980 's and its collapse after entering 1990 's. As for the causes ofthe bubble formation several useful books were published rather intensively during 1992 - 93. But in February 1994, Mr. Mieno, the then Governor of the Bank of Japan, stated at a lecturing speech that the causes of the bubble had not been clarified yet. He enumerated some problems to be solved, for example why bubbles took place almost simultaneously over the world, and why such tremendous rise of asset prices occurred. Basically this reflection seems to be right. Relevant researches, which were published mostly during 1992 - 1993, if we dare to simplify, pointed out two factors as the important causes of the bubble: various financial de-regulations and long-lasted <b>cheap</b> <b>money</b> <b>policy</b> which was closely concerned with the so-called "international cooperation of economic policy" in 1986 - 87. This paper is not against these arguments at all. However it calls attentions to the fact that preceding researches have overlooked an important problem to be solved: that is to say, the problem of the correlation between the rapid appreciation of yen and the soaring up of asset prices. The paper tries to analyze the simultaneous development of yen appreciation and asset inflation. Consequently it points out that the key factor was the massive inflow of foreign short-term capital. In other words, banks took in huge short-term money from abroad and lent it to firms as impact loan, which is presumably a peculiar Japanese financial instrument. Firms converted borrowed dollar into yen and invested it in asset markets. In the case of stocks, Tokkin & Fan-tora, deposited with trust banks, played an important role as the intermediary. Thus the prices of assets rose steeply. The banks' huge taking-in of foreign short-term money resulted in a strong selling pressure on US dollar in the exchange market. Thus the dollar fell and the yen rose. A pioneering work along this line is S. Nakao (1991). Unfortunately he confines his interest to the relation between the activities of banks and the appreciation of yen, putting the codevelopment of yen appreciation and the asset inflation out of his argument. In addition, preceding researches, which stress the financial deregulations as the most important cause of the bubble, tend only to enumerate various de-regulations. And they seem to have been unsuccessful in clarifying what part of the deregulations was crucial. This paper deems the abolitions of regulations on impact loan and on yenten as crucial. It was these de-regulations that played by far the most important roles in the formation ofthe bubble. Finally, the reader will see some concluding remarks {{at the end of the}} paper. The main concern of the paper lies, however, in the field of fact verification. What to learn or derive from verified facts belongs rather to a role of politicians and high officials...|$|E
