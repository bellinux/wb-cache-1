5|$|The Canadian {{province}} of Alberta holds elections to its unicameral legislative body, the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. The maximum period between general elections {{of the assembly}} is five years, but the Lieutenant Governor is able to <b>call</b> <b>one</b> at any time. However, the Premier has typically asked the Lieutenant Governor to call the election in {{the fourth or fifth}} year after the preceding election. The number of seats has increased over time, from 25 for the first election in 1905, to the current 87.|$|E
5|$|There was {{speculation}} during September {{and early}} October 2007 about whether Brown {{would call a}} snap general election. Indeed, the party launched the Not Flash, Just Gordon advertising campaign, which was seen largely as pre-election promotion of Brown as Prime Minister. However, Brown announced on 6 October {{that there would be}} no election any time soon – despite opinion polls showing that he was capable of winning an election should he <b>call</b> <b>one.</b> This proved to be a costly mistake, as during 2008 his party slid behind the Conservatives (led by David Cameron) in the polls. Disputes over political donations, a string of losses in local elections, and by-election losses in Crewe and Glasgow did himself and the government no favours either.|$|E
5|$|Notably, KOF 94 innovated {{the genre}} by {{replacing}} a traditional round-based format used in preceding fighting {{games with a}} format consisting of 3-on-3 team based matches dubbed the Team Battle System. Instead of choosing a single character, the player selects from one of eight available teams, each consisting of three members. Before each match, the players choose {{the order in which}} each of their team member enters the battle. When the match begins, the members chosen to go first on their respective teams will fight. When one character is defeated, the following member of the same team will take his or her place, while the character on the other team will have a small portion of their life restored (if energy was lost during the previous round). If a character is losing a match against the opponent, then the player can <b>call</b> <b>one</b> of the remaining teammates standing on the sidelines to jump in and perform a support attack. The match ends when all three members of either team lose.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, {{while the}} Prime Minister has {{a measure of}} {{latitude}} in deciding when to hold a by-election, the Court reiterated that {{this does not mean}} that the Prime Minister is entitled to defer the calling of an election to fill a vacancy indefinitely, or to simply declare that he will not be advising the President to issue a writ of election. The Court opined that even if at a particular point in time the Prime Minister felt that it would not be appropriate to call for an election to fill a vacancy, he would still be compelled to review the circumstances from time to time and <b>call</b> <b>one</b> if and when the circumstances changed.|$|E
25|$|On 5 November 1688, William, Prince of Orange {{landed at}} Torbay. Rochester {{was a leading}} voice for the calling of a free and legal Parliament and that {{negotiations}} should be opened with William. James replied to this petition that he wished for a free Parliament but would only <b>call</b> <b>one</b> after William had left England, declaring that {{so as long as}} he was present a free Parliament was impossible as William could command nearly one hundred votes. At the council of Lords held by James, Rochester defended the petition and declared that he saw no hope for king and country except through a Parliament. He added that negotiations should be opened with William.|$|E
500|$|In wrestling, coaches may {{challenge}} a referee's call by throwing a predetermined [...] "soft object" [...] {{into the ring}}. Although this is normally a foam brick, wrestling rules do not specify what the soft object must be. During the 2016 Olympic wrestling events, the organizers provided coaches with soft plush dolls of Vinicius to throw into the ring when they wished to {{challenge a}} <b>call.</b> <b>One</b> wrestler's coach received a Vinicius doll with a red shirt, while the opponent's coach received one with a blue shirt.|$|E

Jordan calmly advises her to conceal herself upstairs, but when the call is disconnected, Jordan calls Leah back, a decision that costs Leah her life, as the ringing phone gives her location away to the intruder. Jordan attempts to dissuade him from going further over the phone. He responds [...] "It's already done" [...] and hangs up, leaving her distraught. The next day, Jordan sees a television report confirming that Leah has been murdered. Emotionally affected by the incident, Jordan tells her boyfriend, Officer Paul Phillips (Morris Chestnut), that she can no longer handle field calls.|$|E
500|$|... {{suggest that}} service {{vehicles}} and emergency vehicles should use minimax paths when {{returning from a}} service call to their base. In this application, the time to return {{is less important than}} the response time if another service call occurs while the vehicle {{is in the process of}} returning. By using a minimax path, where the weight of an edge is the maximum travel time from a point on the edge to the farthest possible service <b>call,</b> <b>one</b> can plan a route that minimizes the maximum possible delay between receipt of a service call and arrival of a responding vehicle. [...] use maximin paths to model the dominant reaction chains in metabolic networks; in their model, the weight of an edge is the free energy of the metabolic reaction represented by the edge.|$|E

500|$|In August, the British finally {{launched}} their campaign to capture New York City. [...] They first landed on Long Island in force, and flanked Washington's forward {{positions in the}} Battle of Long Island. [...] General Howe refused to act on a significant tactical advantage that could {{have resulted in the}} capture of the remaining Continental troops on Long Island, but he chose instead to besiege the fortified positions to which they had retreated. [...] Although Washington has been criticized by many historians for sending additional troops to reinforce the redoubts on Long Island, it was clear to both Washington and the Howes that the Americans had successfully blocked the East River against major shipping by sinking ships in the channel, and that he was consequently not risking the entrapment of additional men. [...] In the face of a siege he seemed certain to lose, Washington then decided to withdraw. [...] In what some historians <b>call</b> <b>one</b> of his greatest military feats, he executed a nighttime withdrawal from Long Island across the East River to Manhattan to save those troops and materiel.|$|E
500|$|Although it is {{generally}} a silent species, during the breeding season the vocalizations of the long-tailed ground roller include a [...] "hooting" [...] sound, a [...] "popping" [...] tu-tuc, and a soft boo sound. The low-pitched [...] "hooting" [...] is given by males from a perch [...] above the ground at dusk or at night. The sound carries for a distance of at least [...] and may either attract a mate or defend a territory. The bird pumps its tail while giving this <b>call.</b> <b>One</b> territorial call {{is a series of}} soft boo notes, typically coming in sets of six to ten and descending in volume near the end. Another call, given by both sexes, is a series of chuckling tu-tuc sounds lasting between 10 and 40seconds that occasionally ends in a loud snapping sound produced by the wings. This call is given when birds are close to each other either on the ground or on low perches, and it does not carry over long distances. The use of wing-snapping to produce a sound is a rare phenomenon in birds, and in the order Coraciiformes only one other family, the todies, is known to do it. Low gu notes are given by mates as they come in contact with each other.|$|E

While the IWW shared {{the concept of a}} mass-oriented labor movement—what the IWW would <b>call</b> <b>One</b> Big Union—with the Knights of Labor, the idea of workers having much in common with employers was discarded by the IWW, whose Preamble declares that [...] "the working class and the employing class have nothing in common." ...|$|E
2500|$|Note on nomenclature: Calling {{one set of}} transformations {{the normal}} Lorentz transformations and the other the inverse transformations is misleading, {{since there is no}} {{intrinsic}} difference between the frames.
