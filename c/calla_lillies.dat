5000|$|If the egg had a {{surprise}} (as all Fabergé eggs ever made did) {{there is no}} good record of what it was and none has survived with the current egg. It is not know what may have become of the surprise or when it may have been lost or how. The egg was executed by one of Fabergé's workmasters, but the name of the workmaster was not recorded and the egg itself bears no maker's marks or other hallmarks of its manufacture, at one point leading to some doubts as to its authenticity. It is designed as an egg-shaped silver-gilt oyster guilloche basket containing a bouquet of blossoms of mock orange, daisies, pansies, <b>calla</b> <b>lillies,</b> cornflowers, morning glories, and oats, with the date [...] "1901" [...] displayed on the front in diamonds. The egg stands on a blue enameled pedestal (not its original— the original white enamel was likely damaged during the Russian Revolution and has been replaced/ re-enameled with the current blue seen today), and is surmounted by an arcing basket handle of gold and diamonds. Base and egg are also decorated in a trellis work of diamonds.|$|E

40|$|Oidiopsis haplophylli (syn. Oidiopsis sicula) was {{identified}} as the causal agent of powdery mildew diseases occurring on five ornamental species in Brazil. This disease was observed in plastic house-grown lisianthus (Eustoma grandiflorum: Gentianaceae), in nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus: Tropaeolaceae) cultivated under open field conditions and in greenhouse-grown calla lily (Zantedeschia aethiopica: Araceae), impatiens (Impatiens balsamina: Balsaminaceae) and balloon plant (Asclepias physocarpa: Asclepiadaceae). Typical disease symptoms consisted of chlorotic areas on the upper leaf surface corresponding to a fungal colony in the abaxial surface. With the disease progression, these chlorotic areas eventually turned to necrotic (brown) lesions. Fungi morphology on all hosts {{was similar to that}} described for the imperfect stage of Leveillula taurica (O. haplophylli). The Koch's postulates were fulfilled by inoculating symptom-free plants via leaf-to-leaf contact with fungal colonies. Additional inoculations using an isolate of O. haplophylli from sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum) demonstrated that it is pathogenic to all five species belonging to distinct botanical families, indicating lack of host specialization. This is the first formal report of a powdery mildew disease on lisianthus, <b>calla</b> <b>lilly,</b> impatiens and nasturtium in Brazil. It is, to our knowledge, the first report of O. haplophyllii infecting A. physocarpa, extending the host range of this atypical powdery mildew-inducing fungus. This disease might become important on these ornamental crops especially in protected cultivation and also under field conditions in hot and dry areas of Brazil...|$|R

O fungo Oidiopsis haplophylli (= O. sicula) foi identificado como sendo o agente causal de uma nova doença do tipo oídio em beijo-de-frade (Impatiens balsamina: Balsaminaceae), capuchinha (Tropaeolum majus: Tropaeolaceae), copo-de-leite (Zantedeschia aethiopica: Araceae), lisianthus (Eustoma grandiflorum: Gentianaceae) e flor-borboleta (Asclepias physocarpa: Asclepiadaceae) em Brasília-DF, Brasil. Esta doença foi observada em condições de casa de vegetação em beijo-de-frade, copo-de-leite, lisianthus e flor-borboleta e em condições de campo na capuchinha. O sintoma típico é o aparecimento de uma área clorótica na superfície superior da lâmina foliar que corresponde a uma colônia fúngica na superfície inferior. Com o progresso da doença, estas lesões tornavam-se necróticas e eventualmente coalesciam. As características morfológicas, observadas em microscopia de luz, corresponderam àquelas descritas para a fase imperfeita do fungo Leveillula taurica (O. haplophylli). Os testes de patogenicidade foram completados via inoculação por contato entre folhas sadias e folhas apresentado colônias do fungo. Um isolado de pimentão foi também patogênico a estas cinco espécies ornamentais (pertencentes a diferentes famílias botânicas) confirmando a ausência de especialização por hospedeiro deste fungo. Este é o primeiro registro deste patógeno nestas espécies ornamentais no Brasil e, provavelmente, o primeiro relato de flor-borboleta como hospedeira. Este oídio pode se tornar importante para o cultivo destas espécies em cultivo protegido ou condições de clima quente e seco...|$|R
