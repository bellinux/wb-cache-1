25|$|Superheterodyne {{receivers}} {{have essentially}} replaced all previous receiver designs. The development of modern semiconductor electronics negated {{the advantages of}} designs (such as the regenerative receiver) that used fewer vacuum tubes. The superheterodyne receiver offers superior sensitivity, frequency stability and selectivity. Compared with the tuned radio frequency receiver (TRF) design, superhets offer better stability because a tuneable oscillator is more easily realized than a tuneable amplifier. Operating at a lower frequency, IF filters can give narrower passbands at the same Q factor than an equivalent RF filter. A fixed IF also allows {{the use of a}} <b>crystal</b> <b>filter</b> or similar technologies that cannot be tuned.

50|$|The {{most common}} use of <b>crystal</b> <b>filters</b> are at {{frequencies}} of 9 MHz or 10.7 MHz to provide selectivity in communications receivers, or at higher frequencies as a roofing filter in receivers using up-conversion.

25|$|Usually the {{intermediate}} frequency {{is lower than}} the reception frequency fRF, but in some modern receivers (e.g. scanners and spectrum analyzers) a higher IF frequency is used to minimize problems with image rejection or gain the benefits of fixed-tuned stages. The Rohde & Schwarz EK-070 VLF/HF receiver covers 10kHz to 30MHz. It has a band switched RF filter and mixes the input to a first IF of 81.4MHz. The first LO frequency is 81.4 to 111.4MHz, so the primary images are far away. The first IF stage uses a <b>crystal</b> <b>filter</b> with a 12kHz bandwidth. There is a second frequency conversion (making a triple-conversion receiver) that mixes the 81.4MHz first IF with 80MHz to create a 1.4MHz second IF. Image rejection for the second IF is not a major problem because the first IF provides adequate image rejection and the second mixer is fixed tuned.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>crystal</b> <b>filter</b> is an {{electronic}} filter that uses quartz crystals for resonators.
